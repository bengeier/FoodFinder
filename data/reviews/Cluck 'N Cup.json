{"text":"I walked in @ 730am...no one here...ok, no biggie.  Asked for cinnamon roll..nope..didn't have any.  Guy working informed me...yea we don't have anything but breakfast sandwiches we mainly make stuff for our other location.  Really?  Why are you open at 7am then?  So I asked for a small cup of coffee with some Carmel flavoring.  Sure, the guy says, if I have any Carmel.  I paid for my cup of coffee and guess what?  It tastes burnt.  Yep, Couldn't be 30 minutes old and it tastes like it's been sitting on the warmer all day.  Visited the ladies room.  No better.  Lights out in the ceiling and the CHEAPEST t.p you've ever seen.  Can't even get it off the roll. Had read a great review of this place in the paper and was looking forward to trying it out, but I will not be frequenting this establishment."}
{"text":"Chicken pot pie is so good. A great comfort food in a cold rainy day.  And the owner is so nice and friendly. My mom loves their pies."}
{"text":"Love Cluck and Cup! I always tend to get the same thing everytime I go, but the food is always perfection everytime. The staff is friendly & helpful when ordering. My experience never seems to disappoint. The atmosphere is relaxed with a social environment. I sometimes bring clients with me for lunch meetings & they never seem to mind. I recommend getting their broccoli casserole as a side dish with their be chicken wrap! It's to die for!"}
{"text":"Just had my first experience. Food was very good, highly recommend the chicken pot pie. Their brownies are also really good and very rich. Good food."}
{"text":"Awesome little Mom n' Pop shop. Best chicken pot pie I've ever had, and some solid sides like broccoli cheese casserole. The $6.45 daily specials with side and drink are a steal, and the people that work there are incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"I was looking for a lunch place located around Southend and this place came up on Yelp, read couple reviews and I was sold on trying it out.  I had to try the Chicken Pot pie and the the Broccoli casserole, both were delicisous.  I got to try the Chicken Wrap which was also very good and fresh.  Place is easy to find, had no issue parking, staff was very friendly and the prices are very affordable for lunch.  I will be back for sure to try the salads they have on their menus."}
{"text":"Cute southern home atmosphere. The chicken pot pie, chili soup, broccoli casserole, and fruits were all delicious! I definitely recommend the chicken pot pie and broccoli casserole."}
{"text":"Don't believe their web site as to hours they are open. Web site is wrong and appears they close early if they want to. I well spend my money elsewhere Can't judge their food as they were CLOSED"}
{"text":"it was just okay. A decent cold sandwich nothing special. They were out of Chicken Salad when I came. Broccoli casserole best item on menu."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at this spot for months. They have changed staff around a few times and the service was seeming to get better and faster. I have been known to wait 15 minutes for a coffee, but their food is good and nearby so it's easy to go and maybe take a client. I usually order the same thing and this past week called in for my \"regular\" sandwich. I confirmed the price over the phone and went down to pick it up.   When I arrived I was told a much higher price, and I was a little shocked considering I order this item all the time. The cashier said it was from the breakfast menu (turkey?) and that I would have to pay the higher price. Turns out that I was speaking with the owner, who did not want to seem to budge on charging me the price I was given on the phone, and had been charged that amount multiple times before. She eventually took my money at the lower price. After I had to HAGGLE with her for longer than I would ever wish to.  She has just lost a regular customer.  Changing the price of items is at their discretion, of course. However, I expect to be paying the price I was given over the phone. Her staff was very apologetic, and I had always had good experiences with this restaurant in the past. Too bad the owner doesn't have the same attitude about customer service."}
{"text":"THE BEST chicken pot pie in Charlotte. Sadly, the southend and uptown locations have closed. But, the good news is that their kitchen on Bland street will remain open!!!  Can get chicken pot pies to go!!!  And, from what I hear, they'll be offering additional selections soon!"}
{"text":"I've been seeing this cluck n cup sign a lot lately on my drives home. So I finally decided to stop in today to check it out. So good! I got the chicken pot pie combo. Come with the pot pie, a side, and a drink. All for $6... wow! This pot pie was amazing! I got the broccoli casserole as my side... creamy goodness! I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing, probably the best chicken pot pie we've ever had!  The service was outstanding as well:)"}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to try it for the first time today and I can absolutely say that i will definitely be back! The broccoli casserole was sooooooo good! It had the perfect amount of flavor, I can't find anything wrong. The chicken pot pie was the main dish and I can't say enough good things about it. The flakiness of the crust was unbeatable, I loved it! Not to mention the food was piping hot and I ordered to go. I think I found my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and the seller's realtor recommended this place and raved about their chicken pot pies. Haven't had that yet, I just stopped in for some breakfast and a cup of coffee. Such a cute spot! I love it. I also love that I can walk here, but that might not be helpful to you. I had the breakfast banana split and it was divine - fresh fruit and scrumptious yogurt and granola with raisins.  The staff was really really friendly and the decor was adorable. Place was immaculately clean. I will definitely be back for lunch to try that famous pot pie."}
{"text":"Visiting from West Virginia, stopped here and I ordered promptly from a very very nice man a Almond Roca iced coffee YUM! Really cute decor & friendly atmosphere. We will be back"}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service was horrible.  Took 30 minutes to bring out food to begin with, then forgot one order and continued to tell us it would be right out.  After 15 more minutes without explanations had to ask for money back.  Very disappointing"}
{"text":"The staff is so unprofessional and just down right rude. When you order anything they make you feel like you're putting them out. The food is just OK and it takes them a solid 10+ minutes to make a coffee."}
{"text":"I had the turkey, apple, brie and it was AWESOME. I suggest getting it on the croissant. The service was good, friendly, and prompt. My friend had the chicken pot pie and said it was great as well. Tasted like it was home-made.  I have now tried the Chicken pot pie and it is AMAZING. Love it!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could say I've eaten here but they're always closed. I went out of my way to eat dinner here tonight and the sign said open til 8:00pm. But they were closing at 5 p.m. This is the second time I've been here to eat in the past year where they were closed. There will be no third chances to eat here. The food must be awesome otherwise I don't know how they're still in business."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch the other day after over a year of wanting to try one of these Charlotte locations. I went to the location in South End and was quite happy with the outcome. After seeing what the chicken pot pies looked like I simply couldn't pass it up. Unfortunately it wasn't Wednesday so I paid a little more than the normal $5.99!!! that it usually is on special. Even at \"full price\" this meal was great. I may be a bit bias since I have what I'm sure is an unhealthy obsession with pot pies but how could something that makes you so happy ever be bad for you. I stand by the fact that pot pies are delicious and Cluck N' Cup nails it with theirs.  As a side it seems the broccoli casserole is the claim to fame here but I went with the Asian slaw which was great. Had some toasted pine nuts on it and a sweet (honey-based maybe) sauce with a little hit of vinegar. After scoping the broccoli casserole at another table though I'm confident I'll lean that way on my next visit. I had the opportunity to try a bite of my cousin's turkey sandwich as well which was also good. I'm a fan of very thin sliced turkey piled high and this hit the spot in my opinion.   One point I need to make is regarding the price. For a place like this where many of the items seem very fresh and high quality I'd expect a higher price. The full-price menu was extremely reasonable in my opinion and if you choose an item on special it becomes that much more reasonable.  The location itself is tucked back in a mixed-use area off of South Blvd. with enough parking (although we walked) and the interior has great lighting and all-in-all was a great place to grab a bite for lunch. I could see the venue being a perfect spot for some coffee with laptop in tow as well but you'd want to choose one of the comfy chairs available if you did that."}
{"text":"Always on the hunt for a new coffee joint,  I stopped here the other day for a cup of joe before doing some shopping. I was looking for something to eat as well but only saw a lunch menu and specials  so not sure if they offer b-fast or not? Coffee was fresh and did the trick. I like the random paper table cloths with crayons they have on each table so you can draw out your feelings and whats on your mind (don't worry, I didn't write out where's the freakin breakfast menu??) Friendly peeps....get it...peeps. cluck? Yes, no? Anywho, I'll check this place out again"}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant and their Wednesday special of Chicken Pot Pie.  I bought the special for both me and my wife.  We both enjoyed it greatly.    The chicken pot pie was delicious and was a great value for $5.99 which includes both a side and a drink.  It definitely beats fast food.  I look forward to future visits to the Cluck N' Cup, if I can ever get used to the name."}
{"text":"Tucked away in Sothend awaits Cluck N' Cup.  It is a great location for a mid-way meeting place outside of the scurry of Uptown (though there is an Uptown location, too). Parking can be extremely tough but have patience!  I have been there twice now and though the food is good and the atmosphere is comfortable, there really isn't a wow factor to keep me coming back.  I won't turn it down for a homemade lunch but it is not on my target go to spots.  I had the Turkey, Apple and Brie wrap during my last visit and I enjoyed it.  I was a little underwhelmed by my side of fruit which was a portion cup that you would use for condiments."}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch today here for the first time. What an awesome lunch! The chicken pot pie is DELICIOUS!! Homemade everything!!"}
{"text":"I've been to cluck-n-cup southend three times now and every time was a bad experience. The first time I went in they were out of chicken! Not sure how a chicken restaurant can run out of chicken in the middle of lunch time. The second time I went in they were out of turkey! Today was strike three, and I will not be a patron in the future. When I went in for lunch today, I asked for a menu and they were out. Out of menus. I asked the cashier what my options were and he was just as helpful as the menus they didn't have. I asked if they had an online menu and he said he thought so. I pulled up their website on my phone, clicked on the menu and it lead to a dead page. I left and went across the street to noodles and company, where I received fantastic service, they had menus, and chicken! I will say that the food I was able to get the last couple of times was good, which is the only reason I'm giving them one star"}
{"text":"Support your local small business owners!!  Good food - 'home cooking' freshly prepared, not like other fast food joints. Neat atmosphere and generally a nice change of pace. Saw a sign in Uptown and appears one is also opening on McDowell Street."}
{"text":"What an adorable little place this is!   I came during lunch rush (~12:30) on a Wednesday to sample the Chicken Pot Pie special. The parking lot was a bit of a pain and I had to stalk a poor woman leaving the salon next door to snag a space. There were no open tables and a handful of people in line, which I had expected.  They have a different lunch special everyday of the week (see picture!). On Wednesday's it's a Chicken Pot Pie , choice of side and a a beverage for $5.99 - not bad.   The ladies working the front counter are the most adorable, friendly people you could imagine. This place really has homey, southern feel to put you at ease on a stressful workday.  I ordered my meal to go and it only took a few minutes to come out and I couldn't wait to get back to the office to try it. The pastry was perfectly fluffy and soft and the inside was STUFFED with chicken among other veggies. They definitely did not skimp on the pot pie fixin's here. The broccoli casserole was delicious as well, though a little salty and dripping in butter. I was only able to eat about the half the pie, in addition to the small cup of casserole.  All in all, $5.99 for a little under two meals is definitely a bargain. I just wish this place was a little less busy (selfish request, I know). Next time I'll be sure to come before 12."}
{"text":"I didn't want to go because of the name!  But it's a lot nicer than I expected.  Basically a French bistro-style brunch restaurant that also serves sandwiches and coffee.  Impeccably clean and they put white paper on the tables and have crayons for the young-uns.  Their signature item is the chicken pot pie with a side of broccoli casserole.  I cant eat it because of my non-dairy status but that's not their fault.  So I opted for a ham and egg English muffin sammy.    Hash browns are a new item but it's a little brick that tastes like it came from a box and was not cooked all the way through.  I hope they change it to something more appealing.    They do have soy milk for coffee which is a plus!  So I would try \"Cluck 'N Cup\" again.  The staff is very friendly and kind enough to answer all my questions as a first-timer."}
{"text":"A quaint little coffee shop with a super friendly staff and a quiet, local vibe. Their coffee was strong but not acidic. They had miniature pecan pies that tried to tempt me out of my pre-wedding diet, but I resisted (this time). Next time, I'm hitting the miniature pecan pies HARD."}
{"text":"I found this cute little spot on a whim. I got a good chuckle out of the sign and it's logo, a chicken in a cup lol (maybe I'm just easily amused) The interior is very relaxed and definitely has that cozy, southern feel. The prices are VERY reasonable, about $10 or less and the staff is, as expected, incredibly sweet.  I ordered the chicken pot pie with broccoli casserole. Both were DELICIOUS, definite comfort food! I wish my chicken pot pie was a little warmer though. Regardless, it was amazing! My friend was tempted to buy a \"Take and Bake,\" which is a ready-made chicken pot pie that you would bake at home. Too bad we had plans afterwards and didn't think it was a good idea to leave it in the car. Luckily, I live right by Cluck N' Cup yielding PREMIUM ACCESS (be jealous! haha) With that said, I will definitely be back soon. I peeked at our neighbor's table and saw their Frittata.. definitely gotta try that too! That is if I can convince myself to sway away from the chicken pot pie! (Yes, I'm one of those creepers that peek at other people's dishes and think \"aww I want that instead!!!\" ..super indecisive foodie)"}
{"text":"Ate at the location N.Charlotte zone.. Behind the Hilton Garden Inn, exit 18 I-77 North.   New customer, and well... WOW on the chicken pot pie.  Great crust, great filling, it was a good, GOOD pot pie.  Will be back to try other items."}
{"text":"Cluck n cup is a solid performer when it comes to choosing a place for lunch. Their chicken pot pie is awesome!! Try their chicken quesadilla it is today's special."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been to Cluck n Cup and now I'm reminded why I need to come back more often.  This is the place for fresh salads, the salad dressing are homemade and they have some great choices to choose from.  Check out their daily lunch specials you can get a meal & a drink for $5.99."}
{"text":"Came in with my mother-in-law and daughter.  They ordered the chicken pot and broccoli casserole.  I ordered the lasagna.  I had a few bites of their pot pies, best pot pie ever.  Crust was very flaky n tasty, filling had a lot chicken.  Lasagna was really good also.  Service was excellent.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Chicken Pot Pies!  So to be honest, whenever I come here, I watch my co-workers eat every last little crumb of their Chicken Pot Pies. I am always on a diet, so i usually have a big salad. The salads are great and the service is pretty fast, but people really rave about the pies. My co-workers dream about them.  You place your order at the counter and then get a number - they bring your items to the table and your drinks and refill your drinks for you. Nothing fancy, but the food is good and everyone is friendly."}
{"text":"Rarely does a place exceed my expectations but this place did! We placed a lunch order through a delivery service, the food was delicious however several items were incorrect. (wrong bread, item size etc) I called to see what they could do where I found out that it was actually ordered wrong by the delivery service! Not only did they gladly fix the problem but they added a few extra goodies as an \"I'm sorry\" and delivered it to us personally! Kudos Cluck 'n Cup!  Let's talk about the food for a second, their chicken is about the freshest around not just some diced rubber stuff that other places serve. Their chicken pot pie is out of this world and their salads are huge and tasty! The broccoli casserole is a don't miss! A little tip, you can purchase unbaked individual or full sized pot pies and fix them yourself or freeze for a treat later!"}
{"text":"Awesome chicken pot pie, need to try the shrimp tacos and broccoli casserole."}
{"text":"Good value. Good food.  I started new job in South End. Recently discovered place. One of my favorite things is chicken pot pie!  And their's is supurb. Flaky crust on top. Made fresh.  Lots of meat, veggies, gravy.  Have had asian cole slaw and broccoli casserol sides. They keep ur drink filled. Limited parking is as a challenge. Stop on in y'all."}
{"text":"I used to come in here a few times a week. The staff is friendly, the food is pretty good, and the prices are mediocre. For lunch, I only go if I like the special that day because it's a very good deal. Their breakfast is also pretty tasty.   Unfortunately, I have pretty much stopped going at all since probably 5 out of the last 7 times I have been in they are out of what I order or at least an ingredient in what I order. It is extremely frustrating and has really caused me to stop going as I don't want to go out of my way to get there only to be told they don't have the items on their menu. this usually happens at breakfast and I think it's because they wait on a truck to bring them items from their other location every morning and sometimes it doesn't get there until later but either way it has caused them to basically lose me as a customer unless absolutely necessary. I would recommend as long as you are flexible on what you want to eat that day."}
{"text":"A nice small cafe tuck away on McDowell Street off South Blvd. I have known this place for 4 yrs now. And tend to forget about it sometimes. At one point I dodged the place completely due to the horrible customer service and the awful coffee all came from one staff. Now that he's gone.. This cafe is my go to when I'm in the mood for something healthy.. Their salads are delicious.. Alway made fresh. Their chicken in the salad comes out warm. Their chicken pot pies are what they're known for, comes out soo freaking hot.. Don't even think about having it for a quick lunch.. It will take forever to cool down.. Everybody loves it. I'm not a fan.. However I love their lasagna. When I'm carving for comfort food. That's my go to. And that's their Friday special.. But since they tend to make everything fresh. It takes a little longer to make. If you want something to go. It's best to call first.. Check out their menu online and give them a try.. There will be something on the menu you will like.. Or take home a pot pie and bake it yourself!"}
{"text":"So this place is right next to my office and it's becoming a habit of mine!  Breakfast is AWESOME, seriously, awesome.  Any breakfast sandwich - put that in your mouth.  And for those folks NOT nursing a hangover, the oatmeal (loaded with pecans, brown sugar and fresh fruit) is to die for!  nom nom nom.  Admittedly, I've never had their coffee.  I love coffee, but they've got some killer tea options so I always go there.    Food is fast and everything I've every gotten has been scrumptious.  The Asian chicken salad is huge and top notch.  The hummus sandwich, on point.  The guys I work with always enjoy the wraps.  I've heard the pot pie is delectable - but I've never tried it for fear that I might need a nap after eating all those tasty calories.    Listen - I've seen a few comments about the staff, and I want to make sure that you know the guys that work there are sheep in wolf's clothing.  Cut them a break, while they may look rough and tough - give them a smile.  They are the sweetest people in the world.  Remember that their job consists of people barking orders at them all day.  You might forget to smile every once in awhile too. Give them a compliment and enjoy your delicious meal!"}
{"text":"This place is really charming. Tucked away all the way in the back of a shopping center in South End, I would have never known about this place if my friend Carolyn hadn't checked in here for lunch one day!  The space is really nice and cozy, while still having sort of an upscale diner feel to it. Going on a Wednesday was apparently the right thing to do because $5.99 for a huge chicken pot pie, side, and drink is the way to go folks! The pie came out steaming hot and flaky deliciousness. I usually prefer my chicken pot pies a bit creamier with more sauce but this one was still excellent and fresh. I don't ever drink sodas anymore but wow drinks included with the food? A nice touch was when we were ready to go they asked if we would like a to go cup filled up, I appreciate the little things like that. It shows that they care about your business. I got a broccoli casserole as a side and it was very nicely flavor seasoned and yummy. But they also offer more healthy choices such as fresh fruit.  The space is quite comfy, with attentive service and good food. Return trips are planned for more pot pie."}
{"text":"The owner must have been having a bad day....just very short.   Usually very nice, love their food, but not great service today."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood place!    When I first saw it, I wasn't sure what it was.      Decent prices.  Great daily lunch specials.    I haven't eaten here - just had various coffee beverages.  And no complaints!    Baristas are super friendly.   Cute atmosphere inside.    Easy to walk to location In south end (kind of behind chipotle).  But also plenty of parking."}
{"text":"We fell in love at once. The atmosphere is terrific and the food is well prepared and freshly made.  The staff is friendly and helpful with suggestions of what combinations work. They also have new hours and are opened till 8pm with wonderful specials that are amazingly priced.  Try it once and you will be hooked!  We are actually going back tonight for the Chicken Pot Pie!  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Tucked away on a small side street call South End gem of a location called cluck n cup. A small coffee shop style setting but don't let it fool you. The food is some kind of Awesome. I had the opportunity to speak with the owner who told me of the process that they used in making their signature dish which is chicken pot pie. Of course after listening to him and looking at the large chicken pot pies, I had to have one to try. This came with it irresistibly moist and tender broccoli cheese casserole which complimented it extraordinarily. The chicken pot pie I had, a small one in a oatmeal sized bowl, was moist and flavor filled, the crust flaky, and irresistible to the palate. I am unaware of anything else they served, but I will be returning to try more."}
{"text":"While visiting Charlotte several weeks back I needed a place to stop into and knock out some emails. Oddly, there were a few coffee shops closed on a weekday so I popped into Cluck 'N Cup for what I thought was going to be a quick break. It turned out that I hung out there for about three hours sipping away on my $4 coffee. It was around 10am that arrived so I sat through their lunch crowd. Things can get pretty busy in there for lunch and there were a few moments where I felt as though me at a four top table in a mad rush for business was simply in the way. The staff was more than accommodating in letting me stay and it turned out that no one was waiting around because of me. Great people and they look to do quite well!"}
{"text":"The new girl they have with the curly hair is a total BITCH!! I asked for the lasagna special and she waits til after i paid and said there was a 20 min wait!! What??? mind you, I'm on my lunch break and cant wait. I told her this and she basically didnt care. I had to wait about 10 minutes to get my money back and when I did she pretty much threw the money at me. I never had this much disrespect here and I doubt I will be back. What a shame because the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Don't fret! Cluck n Cup is not out of business! They've simply downsized to only do catering and \"take & bake\".  This facility in the industrial end of South End is still hopping with take out and catering orders of their delicious pot pies and desserts. So come on down and talk to the friendly proprietors and pick up a homemade pie for dinner tonight. :) We love the convenience of a delicious home made meal with none of the work."}
{"text":"The wife and I tried this place out one evening when we were feeling like a wrap for dinner.  I had the barbecue chicken wrap and the wife had the chicken salad wrap.  Both were delicious.  The service was great.  Both employees were very friendly and attentive.  The prices were also reasonable, which I appreciate.  There were several items on the menu that looked good so I can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"YUM!!!!  Wonderful wholesome homemade food!  Truly has the \"made fresh\" taste.  Cozy, simple atmosphere.  Absolutely perfect ... From  great salads to yummy homemade chicken pot pies.   Good price. Good service. Excellent food!"}
{"text":"Have only been here a few times.  The service and coffee is very good.  Lots of space and tables"}
{"text":"Was going to Five Guys one day for lunch, then I remembered Cluck N Cup was also right there. I had always been meaning to stop in, so I finally did. It was around 3PM so the place was empty. I got the chicken pot pie with broccoli casserole. It came to me in about seven minutes after ordering, FAST. It was pipping hot and reminded me of my moms chicken pot pie, very good. The crust was flaky, buttery and inside was ample amounts of chicken and veg with very creamy sauce. Which is probably more of a soup than a sauce, whatever. The broccoli casserole was also very good, I will have to come back, get some coffee and breakfast. It was literally a million degrees when I went so coffee did not sound appetizing when leaving."}
{"text":"What a great spot.  We go in most of the time and get two to-go pot pies.  They are so good.  Easy to heat up later that night.  The pastry style crust is what makes it sooo good.  Also the containers they come in are reusable as disposable Tupperware.  It's a great little bonus.  We also eat in the restaurant sometimes.  The staff is friendly, and it's a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really used to love this place, but it's amazing how staff can make such a huge difference in the customer experience. I just placed an order for pickup, and the woman on the phone could not have been more rude, actin like she was doing me a service because I wanted to buy food from them. Some of the food items are quite good (house salad, salmon bagel), but others are miserable (never order an espresso drink here, it's a disaster). When you add the hit-or-miss menu items to servers with bad attitudes, it's a place that ends up at a 2-star rating."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood spot, so glad it's in our hood. We have lunch here once or twice a week-love this place. They might have the friendliest, nicest staff in Charlotte. The menu is varied, and everything nicely prepared.   My favorite is the spinach & black bean quesadilla, my boss goes crazy over their Chix pot pie. The broccoli casserole side is to die for, tastes like moms.   They also have great sweets for after lunch and full coffee service. The prices are right, check it out!"}
{"text":"First let me start off by saying that the food at the place is delicious and consistent ! I have been on several different occasions and my food has been brag worthy each time. I will be definitely be dining here regularly, but I do have a gripe about the guy who works there (hence the 4 stars). He is not friendly for the most part, and he seems to have lost his sense of urgency for assisting customers. Lucky he hasn't been bad enough for me to stop going. I think it could be the fact that the chicken pot pie and broccoli casserole outweigh the negative. Try them out."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on Saturday morning. A great little find. The place is adorable, and populated with all sorts of poultry paraphernalia--lots of glass and ceramic roosters and chickens giving the place lots of character.  It has also has tons of magazines and books which are really nice if you want to just lounge around have a lazy weekend morning. We ordered the frittata and the breakfast sandwich and both were really solid-- very simply and well-prepared food, nothing Michelin quality but satisfying nonetheless and really reasonable, in fact, I'd say even cheap. Service was a bit gruff at first, but the waiter/cashier warmed considerably after some time. Maybe he was just a little stressed as it seems he's the only person working there besides the kitchen staff. Still, a really nice place for a casual, simple breakfast over the weekend. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Great, fast service. Went for lunch. Ordered a chicken salad wrap. Really delicious! If I'm in the area again I'll return to this business. Not much else to say. Took my food to go but the place appeared to be clean and a nice place to have lunch."}
{"text":"Just ducked in to use the wi-fi in a work emergency and felt guilty so I ordered a lemon desert bar. It was pretty good. The people were friendly enough as well.  Several months later my wife told me about this place with a funny name that had the best chicken-pot-pies anywhere. I laughed that it was the same place, so I went back to try one. Unfortunately if you get there before noon they won't be ready, but you can buy a take and bake with you, so I took one. It takes 40 minutes or so in an oven or toaster oven and my wife was right. I've been craving more ever since. I went back for another one just the other day, but be aware, they close at 4pm."}
{"text":"I love this little place! My now husband and I used to meet up here for coffee before work every day and now that we are married we definitely start many a weekend mornings here together. The breakfast is simple but delicious and to coffee is actually really good.   The staff is sweeter than pecan pie! I'm not even a southern girl and I feel like that's the only way to describe them! They are welcoming but not too pushy. They are kind and attentive.   The prices are great and the atmosphere is about as comfortable as sitting in your mommas breakfast nook. Not to mention you can't beat table cloths you can color on!   I definitely recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow what a gem! Thanks Yelp for helping us discover this place just off South Tryon.  Owner lady is sweet and really helpful. The croissant breakfast sandwiches are amazing and filling. The fruit oatmeal was plentiful and just right. And the cappuccino was large with a perfect amount of froth. Sure it is busy during typical rush times but if you come when everyone is at work it's a quiet place to enjoy a late breakfast or meet with someone you love. They even have paper and crayons for you to draw your next business plan or your best chicken! Make sure to give this place a try, I'll guarantee you'll be back!"}
{"text":"Everything you want in a chicken pot pie. Best I've ever had by far. Buttery flaky crust that pulls apart and doesn't crumble away. Piping hot chicken inside with a creamy sauce. The broccoli casserole and lasagna are very good too. Small place with cafe-like ambience. Plenty of parking. Worth the turn off of South Blvd to frequent this tucked away gem. My only two cautions would be it feels like a small menu and sometimes they run out of food. It hasn't bothered me though because the menu they do have is great and I got to try something I may not have ordered and it turned out yummy too."}
{"text":"PRO: Good Coffee, WiFi, Nice Seating and Table Arrangement, Homey Feeling Inside  CON: Dishes Are Too Basic  Visited on Monday morning, ordered breakfast sandwich and coffee.  Honestly the breakfast sandwich was good, but I was hoping for an American style big and tasty sandwich.  It was literally toast with scrambled eggs, shredded cheese, and spinach leaves (meat replacement).  It's simple I get it, but just not a lot of enjoyment eating it.  Coffee was good.  Free Wifi, and lots of tables to sit at."}
{"text":"Cluck 'N Cup is a cute breakfast and lunch spot where I enjoyed a delightful lunch several weeks ago. I dined at the Southend location just off South Blvd. but there are locations uptown and in north Charlotte as well. The chicken pot pie is very good - I look forward to having this again over the winter. I also sampled the broccoli casserole - also very tasty. Cluck 'N Cup serves a full breakfast menu including breakfast sandwiches (toast, croissants and bagels available), yogurt, oatmeal, muffins and frittatas. A full coffee selection including espresso drinks is also available - yay for serving my favorite, the mocha. Lunch brings several salads, wraps, sandwiches and entrees like the pot pie, lasagna and quesadillas. Lots of chicken is on the menu - hence the \"cluck\". Every day there is a lunch special including a drink for around $5 - $6 - a nice deal - on Wednesday you can get the pot pie, a side and a drink for $5.99. Also, you can purchase pot pie, broccoli casserole and more to take and bake a home - a nice option. I can walk here from home so I look forward to returning to Cluck 'N Cup soon to try the mocha and more of the menu."}
{"text":"This is tough because the service was so friendly that I hate to write anything negative. Judging from all of the positive reviews Cluck N' Cup must have had an off-day. They had great prices, a very convenient location, and really nice staff but I just didn't feel the food was good. I had the chicken salad on a croissant with the broccoli casserole on the side. Their lunch special included a beverage for about $6 after tax which is great. The croissant had been kept in the fridge and the salad didn't taste like anything. The broccoli casserole kind of reminded me of something served in a hospital - just bland and mushy. I'd like to give it another try in the future and hopefully they'll be better."}
{"text":"What a wonderful treat to find in Southend!  A truly friendly neighborhood coffee shop that happens to serve the best home made treats, including the puff pastry Chicken Pot Pie!  Homemade lunch specials everyday Try the frittatas for breakfast and Lasagna on Friday!  Don't forget the Pecan Tarts or the Banana Puddjng,"}
{"text":"Awesome ambience and service. Very chill place to grab coffee or tea. A few tv's with sports on plus a solid magazine / book selection. Excellent chicken pot pie that's a perfect portion of food and comes with 1 side (I went with the fruit salad) for a grand total of $7.50 after tax. I highly recommend this place to anyone in uptown Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The asian chicken wrap is delicious! The atmosphere is casual and warm. Also try the chai latte!"}
{"text":"We thought this place was gone from the Charlotte area but there is one location left that just has take out.   We loooove the chicken pot pies from Cluck N Cup. They are loaded with chicken and all the fixins. They are the best we've ever had. We get the 4lb pie and have it for like 3 days. They also have single serving pies as well. The crust is awesome and so is the filling.   If you've never tried one and you love chicken pot pie you must go here. Simply the best around!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a nice little place to go for some food or snacks then this definitely worth a try. I went for their \"famous\" chicken pot pie and was not disappointed. The Wed. special was the pot pie, side and a drink all for $5.99. That was a deal and very filling. They have daily specials which are very reasonable. They offer a variety of items to take home including the pot pie, delicious chicken salad, desserts, muffins, sides, etc. I've done this in the winter with the pot pie and it made a great dinner after a long day at work in the cold weather. What a treat! I've tried many items on their menu (which includes a great breakfast selection) and have found everything very good to excellent.  The atmosphere is great. It's a really nice little place tucked into a small shopping area behind Lowe's Home Improvement. The place is cute with a chicken decor. It's clean and the staff is very friendly. They offer free internet access so if you are doing a business meeting or just need a place to work and need a cute quiet place, I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I realized I haven't given this precious place a review! I took my bestfriend and her daughter and we all loved it! From their chicken pot pie to their salads they are great! The people who work there were very sweet and accommodating. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First time at Cluck N' Cup.  We ate at their new location on the north-side of Charlotte.....we have tried to eat at their original restaurant on the south-side of town but never managed to get the timing right. The chicken pot pie was very good (nice lean chicken with vegetables and flaky crust) and my wife thought the veggie wrap she got was good too.  I tried the coffee (I had read that they had some of the best around) and it was pretty good for standard coffee (I typically drink espresso so I am not a regular coffee connoisseur). The new location is in a really big space so it is not as cozy/comfy as we would have liked but it was nice and had a good clean atmosphere. We will definitely go back and still want to try the original location."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a killer pot pie look no further. This place is super inexpensive (go on a Wednesday for the pot pie combo special), it's quaint, quiet, and pleasant. To be honest I've never eaten anything besides the pot pie, why would you?"}
{"text":"Great food and an even better value.  Pot pie was delicious, fresh, and hot. Side if slaw was also super. Sweet tea was good.   All for $7  Workers were friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"This place should be way busier but because it exists a short block off South Blvd (at Magnolia, a bit north of Remount), they get very little walk-in traffic. That's a bummer because it's got a super vibe and fantastic prices.  Over a dozen two- and four- top tables plus a couple stools at the counter, there's plenty of space in the morning.  As for the prices, I'm amazed. I chose the most expensive thing on the menu and even with a cup of coffee, it was less than $10. Frittata with \"pick five\" to add to it including four or so cheeses, five meats and five or so veggies, narrowing the field wasn't easy. About ten minutes later, an extremely hot plate came to my table. Tasty, delicious and quite filling.  The coffee was good, too!  A nice little spot, very enjoyable. And I hope to see them succeed!"}
{"text":"The first impression is a lasting impression...   I was excited to see a coffee shop across the street from my dentist as I had an early appointment and no time to enjoy my joe beforehand.   So in I went after having some work done which caused a temporary bi-facial paralysis... I asked what type coffee drinks they offered and the dude behind the counter just points to the tri-fold menu on the counter while STARING at my face.   Okay, whatever, I guess my half paralyzed face is stare-worthy, but really? So I order a large cappuccino and ask where the bathrooms are... again he just points.   So I head to the bathroom and take a look around - very clean, like it. Must mean they keep their kitchen clean as well. As I'm about to leave, I take notice to my face as well... WOW it was stare worthy, but rude anyhow.   I really do like the vibe of this little joint, free wi-fi, nice layout of tables and such and some nice looking sweets.   The coffee was not memorable, but I would give them another chance. I have to have some more work done on Thursday morning, so an update will be done. This review is more like a 2.5, could have been a three, but counter dude was not having a good morning and customer service means a lot to me."}
{"text":"I have only been there for breakfast but it was good.  One time when I was in there I completely forgot my wallet and the owner was so nice and just told me to stop by sometime later on and pay."}
{"text":"I always forget about this place especially since it's right across the street from my dentist. I've been to their Uptown location and I've also been in here once before.  My first time, the staff was wonderful and happy to recommend anything on the menu. This time around they seemed to be a bit rushed and inconvenienced by my arrival. But they warmed up after a while.    Cluck N Cup is known for their breakfast items, coffee and their chicken pies. This time around I went with a breakfast croissant sandwich to go. It was flavorful and the croissant was buttery and flaky just the way I like them.  Inside they have tables and a small conversation area in the front corner. There are also a few seats at the bar and a few tables outside. The signage isn't great viewing it from Magnolia Ave. but if you know where Five Guys is..it's across Magnolia from their parking lot.   Good locally owned place that is worth checking out when you have the time."}
