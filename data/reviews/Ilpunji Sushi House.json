{"text":"Its my wife bday.Kids finish school at 3pm.  Raining so heavily outdoor.  Family decided to go to this place as we all understand that their lunch till 330pm . My daughter politely ask if they can offer us lunch its only past 8 mins.  The waitrezs rudely say \"NO\".  I as suppose to turn around and go but my son was very hungry after a long day school time.  Then we start order 2 dinner, $18.95,  $21.95 and I got the special at 10.95 as there is a sign saying New special Korean pork bone soup.  When I received my soup it was aweful Red incolor  bone are still raw with blood at the corner.  My wife finally share with my daughter and we get out with the bill $64.  I personally will not going back and will tell all my friends amd neighbour about this experience,! Upset and unhappy."}
{"text":"I've been going to this sushi restaurant for years now. They've had slight tweaks in their recipes, but I always leave satisfied. Go there during lunch, because they have many affordable food options."}
{"text":"Ate here on a sat night, wasn't busy and we were seated right away. We ordered the sushi and sashimi combos which were okay, nothing special and not the freshest. Spicy salmon rolls were not good at all. They give you free salad, miso soup, and jap chae which was too oily. Wouldn't come again unfortunately."}
{"text":"I have dined in this restaurant several times before but a recent experience of service was quite a disappointment. 

To be fair, the food itself is good and reasonably priced. It was good enough for me to consider bringing a couple new friends in to try the dishes. I called the day before to make a reservation for a party of 8, which was necessary as I know the place is small and seating is limited, so the restaurant may need this advance notice to set up. The reservation was reconfirmed to ensure that we will be accommodated. (I spoke to a guy over the phone but didn't get his name)

It was to our surprise that when some of my friends arrived on time, we were rejected and denied that a reservation ever took place. The restaurant told them that they were busy and it is not possible to even accommodate for a group that large. 

With disappointments, our group left to a nearby restaurant instead. 

I called Sushi House later on that day to inquire on what happened, and it turns out that the reservation was indeed made but the recorded notes may have been overlooked/missed by the restaurant staff. The person on the phone was apologetic but nothing else was offered for the oversight on their part. 

A nice Sunday afternoon gathering with friends turned out to be with a lot of last minute hassles in trying to find another place to eat, which was all unnecessary. That is a whole point of making a reservation and when a large size of group is expected, it shouldn't have gotten missed like that...

I don't know what else to say, but it's likely that I will not be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Came here a several times for lunch/ dinner. Somewhere close around the area for a quick sushi fix without such high expectations. 

Korean owner, so menu was fusion with a lot of Korean dishes at a good price for Markham location. 

Great lunch and dinner bento specials. Worth a try for something quick.

I would not order the spider roll- it was terrible. I didn't know what it was but some fired tempura batter with avocado, rice rolled together into a piece of I'm not sure if I can call it a \"sushi\"/ maki. 

Spicy salmon/ tuna maki was big, little rice and lots of fish."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

if you're getting take out, order ahead! service is insanely quick: we placed the order as i started my car, and it was ready by the time we arrived, within 20 minutes, not even. platters come with a sizeable side of chapchae (which is actually pretty good; no veggies though), for both dine-in and take out."}
{"text":"Great little spot for a quick lunch or dinner.  Love their bento box combos, so many options that can be included.  Consistent quality, great prices and fast/efficient service.  Always have a great experience here and I've been coming for years."}
{"text":"I've been here a total of three times, but shall only speak of my most recent trip there.

I was there with some friends after exams and were just wanting to grab a quick bite. We were seated quickly but were so close to the door that every time it opened, you would feel the cold winter wind rush in. Not too fun on that account.

It wasn't that hard to look through their menu as everything was laid out and organized, easy to read above all.

In all, we ordered Seafood Udon, Mackerel Maki, Edamame, and their Chirashii dish.

The waiter seemed to have high difficulty understanding what we were asking (what was in the Chirashi as my friends had never tried it before) so there was definitely a noted language barrier. orders came decently quickly too.

The seafood udon (which is what i ordered) was flavoured nicely, light yet enough to taste things without feeling like it was overpowering near the end. A lot of noodles so that really impressed me seeing as udon dishes usually had little to nothing in terms of the actual noodles. Seafood was cooked throughly so big plus. 

Overall, I still was pretty impressed!"}
{"text":"Came here around 2:00pm on a Monday, Not many customers probably only me.

The food was quick, the service was excellent they are always attentive.
I wouldn't say it is that good... but it is better than some places and they have been here for a long time, although i think the owners might have changed, i'm not sure.

The sashimi tasted decent, Thin slices, decent quantity. The tofu tasted ok!  The salad on the other hand wasn't that good honestly I think they got a bit cheap back then they would give you sushi in replace of that salad spot but now .. nope. Back then they also gave you edamme beans, but not anymore~~

Overall- good 

and i will be back !"}
{"text":"I consider Markham to have the highest sushi-per-capita ratio in Ontario. Every other block has an AYCE or sushi house somewhere.  

In other words, Ilbunji sushi house (why is this misspelt on Yelp?) has serious competition, and pales in comparison. 

We went for lunch and had their lunch specials:

3 regular rolls combo - $11.95
Ilbunji combo B (5 sashimi pieces, 4 sushi pieces and one regular roll) - $11.95 

Each came with miso soup, korean jap chae, and salad.

The prices are reasonable I suppose. $12 for lunch is pretty good, except that for $3 more, you can get AYCE lunch... But it's not fair to compare AYCE with a la carte.

My biggest problem is the quality of the sushi at Ilbunji.

Their soft shell crab roll is terrible. It's practically all flour. 
The salmon and avocado is mostly avocado. 
The spicy salmon is passable, similar to T&T sushi. 
Sashimi doesn't look good, nor does it taste good. Definitely not fresh.  

I mentioned previously in this review that it isn't fair to compare la carte sushi with AYCE sushi. I still stand by that. A la carte is supposed to be better right? Wrong! Kiku, Kaka, Yangs, Matsuda, all easily have better sushi than Ilbunji. 

Don't come here. It's a waste. Go to Osaka or Gal's instead."}
{"text":"Above average sushi at a reasonable price. The rice on the maki rolls is thin, which I appreciate. The quality is on par to Gals sushi on Highway 7/Warden. I ordered an 18 piece maki set for $13.95 for dinner. I went another time for lunch and was amazed that their bento box specials are so affordable. For $12.99 my lunch order included 16 pieces of maki, tempura shrimp/veg, tofu, rice, noodles, salad and miso soup. My only complaint is the spicy salmon and tuna rolls are filled with more panko crumbs instead of fish. I prefer Osaka on McCowan but I will definitely be back to this restaurant since it is so reasonably priced."}
{"text":"For what it's worth, I suppose this place is a considerable option for its lunch combos if you're desperate for Japanese food and in the area. With my parents, we ordered two cooked bento boxes ($9 ea) and one chirashi ($11).

To start off, the quality of the sashimi was downright shameful. The piece of red tuna that we got was an inedible cut of the fish - it was tough and had a muscular section throughout that made it impossible to chew apart. The other, more opaque, fish was equally disappointing because it was not fresh and carried an unpleasant odour and taste. The salmon and white tuna were just mediocre. This was unfortunate to find because I quite enjoyed that they provided seaweed salad in the chirashi. 

The only relative \"redeeming factor\" of our meal was the cooked bento boxes. The bulgogi was tender and saucy, and came with plenty of cooked bean sprouts and other vegetables. The chicken teriyaki, however, was just alright. The chicken itself wasn't that tender but because it was thinly sliced, it maintained its moisture and was also complimented by the teriyaki sauce. I liked that the bento boxes also came with salad, a deep fried tofu, and 4 small pieces of california roll. 

Overall, service was very poor. My parents and I got seated into one of the secluded booths which we at first thought \"yay! Jackpot!\" but soon realized \"dang it, we have to hunt down the waitresses ourselves\" as not ONE waitress EVER came in to check on us for more tea/missing utensils/the bill. 

I mean, the prices here aren't the cheapest around for subpar quality sushi so I don't anticipate coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This small sushi restaurant is the place I go most often for Lunch. Their Lunch Bento box are excellent quality and low price. The fish are always fresh and food quality are constant.

All the Bento boxes are accompanied by chap chae(korean noodles), edamame and miso soup. I usually get the Sashimi combo $8.95 or Chirashi Lunch $8.95. both highly recommended.

This place can be pack at lunch hours because limited seats.
Everyone should try this place if they want a great sushi place to go for Lunch"}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday ... ordered the sushi sashimi combo $32 shared it with my husband and myself. Tasty sushi, quick seating ... but the reason I give this place a 3 star is because I had the worst runs ever. I think the sushi might have had bacteria or just not kept as fresh or safe I do not know. I mean, I did not feel like I was going die but that evening after dinner when I got into bed, I was awaken by real bad stomach aches and rushes to the toilet and was stuck there for a good 1hr. I probably won't come back here again even though I use to come here with family 2 years ago. I would give this place a 4 star later if improved. P.s. the tempura batter wasn't good. It was hard and tough to eat the tempura when it should be soft and fluffy."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi in Markham! I usually get the salmon sushi box for $10. Sushi is always fresh and the rolls are perfect, just the right amount of filling to rice. Fast service and good side dishes are always guaranteed."}
{"text":"Sunday night was quiet and the restaurant had a very relaxing and peaceful emvironment.  We had the salmon sashimi and eel avocado roll.  It was decent as the salmon was fresh and the avocado roll had the right mix of eel, avocado, and rice.

Soup, salad, and korean glass noodles were complimentary.
They also had signs everywhere indicating they now serve korean pork bone soup.

Only Asahi beer was available (no Kirin or Sapporo, not sure if just for the one night)"}
{"text":"Dined-in here yesterday for lunch. The sushi didn't taste too fresh this time :/. I got the Sushi A combo which was 9 pieces of nigiri sushi, 6 piece salmon maki, glass noodles, salad, and miso soup ($10.95). 

I'm disappointed b/c last time I got take-out, it tasted fresher.

Also, their chairs were hard af - no cushioning :/.

I'm going to have to try a different sushi place next time - i.e osaka sushi"}
{"text":"I come here frequently since it's not too far from home and helps with my fix on sushi. 

They have changed the menu a bit, they have a create your own bento, which is what I always get because it's hard to pick just one item. 

It's always pretty quiet in here everytime we come, today was a little better with a couple of other tables.  I find the prices pretty fair and the quality pretty good.  Perhaps there are too many choices around the area. 

The service is pretty good, although they don't always come to top up your tea cup. 

There give every person complementary salad and miso soup and a plate of Jap Chae to start, which is always a nice touch since some restaurants only give salads if you order their combo dinner meals.

Got the bento for 21.95 to share with my boyfriend. Came with one choice from the kitchen and 2 choices from the sushi bar. 
Got salmon teriyaki from the kitchen, fairly nice size served on a bed of cooked bean sprouts.  11 piece Sashimi and rolls (you can pick 2). Got spider roll and spicy salmon roll.  The rolls are really good, barely any rice and packed with filling.  The sashimi were 6 pieces of salmon, 2 snapper, 1 tuna, 1 white butter fish and 1 shrimp.  They were decent in size and thickness. 

At the end of the meal they usually give you a fruit with the bill. Sometimes it's oranges, today it was watermelon. 

Definitely a nice place to go if you want a quiet sit down with plenty of choices."}
{"text":"Service is excellent / friendly ... Sushi is fresh ... Portions are large and price is great"}
{"text":"I came in with rather low expectations and came out pleasantly surprised by Ilpunji Sushi House! It's a great, quiet place to enjoy fairly good quality sushi and their lunch specials and also pretty decent.

This place has been around in the Peachtree Plaza for just about forever. When my family and I used to go to Power King next door 15 years ago, this place was still around so I'd say it's about time we finally visited. 

We went for lunch and decided against their lunch specials in favour of a boat (or should I say a bridge? Look at the photo below) which was decent value and has been my measuring stick to determine if restaurants have indeed good or bad sushi. Lunch specials included build your own bentos ($14), regular bentos which should be under $10, amongst various sushi combos. The place is Korean owned with numerous Korean offerings on the menu too (which is a huge plus if you want to eat both). You also start off with a nice plate of sweet japchae as well which is a nice addition. 

The quality of the fish here was definitely one of the highlights here. It's a lot more fresh than most places here which is a genuine surprise. Also there was minimal rice (almost too minimal) in their nigiri sushi, and their maki rolls were also quite adequate. I suppose there could have been more variety of fish in the boat as there was only a standard selection included. Also, I probably wouldn't come here if you're a maki lover as you would probably be disappointed. But that being said they do seem to have quite a bit of special rolls here.

Oranges were served at the end (one per person which is a nice gesture). The place is rather small but I liked how quiet it was. There was also booths and wooden dividers for a more intimate dining. Service was excellent with no problems. I'll definitely be back to Ilpunji Sushi House for good quality sushi nearby."}
{"text":"Amazing food. For its price and quality, it is exceptional value. Place is a little bit old, small, might need some renovation soon. But I'm guessing they would rather keep it that way, just like the traditional style of small  Japanese store, homemade style. I would recommend this place if you want some sushi or bento box or sashimi for very reasonable price."}
{"text":"3.5 stars **

As mentioned, this small Japanese restaurant is runned by Koreans. It has been in the New Kennedy Square (Markham) for so many years and I remember how packed it got during dinner time.

After so many years, I decided to try their lunch again.

Lunch is accompanied by edamame beans and Jap Chae (Korean cold noodles). It was quite packed for a weekday afternoon. 

Ordered:
Choice of (2) sushi rolls on the lunch special ($6.95) - Chose their spicy salmon and california roll.  

Salmon teriyaki + tempura ($10.95) - Also served with a fried tofu, 3 sushi rolls and 2 sashimi pcs. Their tempura was done the way I like it: without too much batter. 

Service was prompt and made sure our tea were filled.

Overall, a good experience. There has to be a reason why it this restaurant has been around for so long and it reflects in their price, service, and food quality."}
{"text":"This place was an average sushi restaurant in Markham. I have always known about this restaurant but never been as there are other sushi  restaurants out there. 

Pieces of fish were fresh. Presentation was nice.

Ambiance was similar to Osaka restaurant. 

Service was not that great considering the restaurant was almost empty for lunch on a weekend. 

I find it weird how you can build your own lunch  bento box. But the prices were a bit on the high side for lunch than I would normally spend. 

I would consider other places before I come here again."}
{"text":"Nice small and cozy. Not the best sushi but it's great value, especially if you order sets. Good for students and it's quick! And the food tastes good! Nothing fancy, just a good meal. 

Mostly, I just order pick up with friends and it's super quick. Orders are ready within minutes so if I wanted to pick up earlier, I can. Sushi comes with a side of miso soup and glass noodles. The soup is too salty and tastes very very pre made, but I just don't drink it. The noodles are interesting :)"}
{"text":"This place has good selection of lunch bentos. 

The miso soup is too salty. I liked the jap chae and edamame beans. Dessert is oranges. 

I recommend the Yakiniku bento - the beef is very tender in a special sweet sauce, cooked with zucchini, bean sprouts, onions and sometimes green pepper. It comes with rice, fried tofu (the batter is not good), 3 small california rolls and 1 each of white fish and salmon sashimi (served warm/room temperature) and salad. 

The kalbi is good as well - nice grill flavor. The sashimi is average."}
{"text":"Closed down. Google says the same, checked in person.

Good and consistent while they lasted"}
{"text":"Came here today with a few of my friends for dinner.  It's a Korean-owned Japanese restaurant, so you're going to have selections ranging from normal sushi to bulgogi.

They gave us some banchans, which was great: 4 pieces of agedashi tofu and japchae.

We ordered a medium boat that had 25 pieces of sushi and 25 pieces of sashimi.  It's actually pretty good - shared among 4 people.  We also had the bulgogi plate, which wasn't that bad either.

Service was great -- everybody was very friendly.  However, we were in a room, so it was hard for us to wave down the waiter every now and then.

Otherwise, it was a typical sushi restaurant.  Nothing amazing or whatever, but still a great place to go to."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been here for years. I usually come for take out and although I don't come often, the food has been consistently good. Also, the prices are good. Their party trays and lunch specials are a good deal and I like their Double Salmon Roll."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times. It's always delicious. The menu has many different sushi items, and specials like Korean Pork Bone soup. Private booths to dine with friends or if you're on a date. The sesame noodles they serve as a appetizer are da bomb!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner.
I thought the prices were high at first but after looking at all the food they give you I would say its a decent price for what you get. I thought in all the dishes the sashimi was sliced to look very large but its actually sliced thin. Also thought the sashimi could have been a bit more fresh. I like my sashimi cold to the touch. The meals also came with miso soup, salad and a large bowl of glass noodles to share.

Tempura Bento Box $12.95 - sushi, fried tofu, fried dumplings, white rice, tempura shrimp and sweet potato. Everything tasted good, but the tempura shrimp and way too much batter.

Bulgogi Bento Box $16.95 - sushi, sashimi, beef, and white rice. The beef was tender and had a nice sweet sauce.

Korean Rib Bento Box $17.95 - sushi, sashimi, Korean ribs and white rice. There were like seven pieces of sliced ribs and also nicely sauced. They were also pretty soft which made the meat even more yummy. 

Service was efficient. English is definitely not the waitresses first language but they understand what you request.

{"text":"This is my go to place for party tray sushi! The food is fresh and the price is worth it. It comes with a side of either glass noodle or salad (decided by the store). Paying in cash is cheaper. Also, WiFi password is on the door."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. This place is a little hard to find in the plaza because the \"Ilpunji\" is minuscule compared to \"Sushi House\" in the sign. The service is friendly and pretty fast. In terms of food presentation, it looks really nice! With wooden boards and bento trays, it looks really authentic. The food quality is just okay. I liked their sushi more than their spicy salmon, which for me is a big thing! I prefer Gal's overall to this place in terms of food quality and price. I ordered the 13 piece sushi lunch with a spicy salmon roll and 7 pieces of assorted sushi for 10.95 before tax."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I believe this place offers the best value for lunch. I know a handful of places that offers the same price point for lunch but their quality is much lower. Bf had the Kalbi lunch and it was great (shown in pictures). I stole a piece of kalbi and it has good beefy flavor with a hint of sweetness. Love it has such strong grill marks without being dry or bitter. 

I'm a huge salmon freak so naturally I ordered a Chirashi with only salmon. Glad they didn't give me a fuss or said I would be charged extra or whatever. The salmon was really fresh and the slices were well portioned. For $8.95 it's definitely good value. 

This place seems like a pretty popular place for take out. When I was here for lunch there's like 8 or 9 people coming in for take out. This place is quite small so come here early to avoid lineups. 

They sell salmon by the pound, so for salmon lovers (like myself) it's a good option for take out."}
{"text":"I had no idea there was a sushi restaurant in the plaza (other than Tenon Vegetarian Sushi). I was quite skeptical upon entering this cozy restaurant as the décor is quite dated and it was quiet (~3 other tables).

We ordered the small sushi (~23pc?) which includes 6 pieces of spicy salmon roll and the rest sushi, the price was about $22. Overall, the service was great and the price for what you get is very reasonable, I will definitely be returning!

We were served miso soup, salad and a bowl of jap chae to start. The sushi was delicious and the portion was alright for two people.

What I do like is that the menu offers a large variety of sushi/sashimi combinations to fit every price range.

We were given two slices of watermelon when getting our bill."}
{"text":"Their lunch specials are always filling and worth the money. Worth (and decor) has definitely declined over the years, but doesn't warrant a three stars in my opinion. Last time we went they gave us 2 pieces less of sashimi (!!!) but after I pointed that out they returned with a small plateful more. Is run by what I think to be a family."}
{"text":"This place impressed me with the quality of their service. Your order comes out super fast, and the ladies at the front work so earnestly to  provide you with a great experience. The sushi  is not high end quality, but you definitely get your money's worth!"}
{"text":"They have great lunch deals (~$10)!! Dinner is also reasonably priced shared. I shared the Ilbunji boat with a friend and the portion was perfect. The fish is fresh and I especially love the spicy salmon, and dynamite rolls! 

Even for take out lunch they give you a full portion of jap chae, green salad and miso soup. The service is also polite which is a nice change for a lot of these no frills sushi joints in Markham. Will definitely be back for the take out lunch!"}
{"text":"This has been the go-to Japanese restaurant that my family and I have been going to since I was in university. They always have fresh ingredients and the perfect portion sizes. My husband and I moved out of town, and this is always the place we talk about in terms of quality and value. Lunch bento boxes are a great option here. They also offer lunch roll combos. We came here for dinner on a Friday night, and we were not disappointed. We had their Bento box #4, which means we could select 2 items from the sushi column. We went with the 11 pieces of sashimi and 2 regular rolls. We also ordered a pork bone soup. Plenty of food for two people and reasonably priced. They also do carry-out orders. Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"I ordered the 65 pcs of $50 party tray for take-out & I was not disappointed.  

This is honestly a first; usually the fishie on top is barely covering the rice but the sushi from Ilpunji was thick and at least half the size LONGER than the rice pieces?!  
The sashimi was sliced thick and fresh.  
All the rolls lived up to par even if some-what average; there was a nice rice to fish balance - there's a nice chunk of sashimi wrapped with a thin layer of rice.

Definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Sushi House Japanese Restaurant is located in New Kennedy Square at Kenndy just South of Hwy 7.

It is a small Japanese restaurant nestled around all these Chinese restaurants. You will barely notice it! And it is runned by Korean.

The appetitizers that comes with the lunch set includes soup, salad, a whole plate of edamame and Korean noodles.
