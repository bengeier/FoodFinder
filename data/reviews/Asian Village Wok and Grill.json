{"text":"I was next in line to order and pay, waiting a moment, while the conversation in front of me wound down.    Waiting was ok.  The customer ordering was telling the owner his shop serves better soup than his favorites in \"Saigon.\"  He's a frequent traveler to Vietnam,  and was simply offering his gratitude for the food being served here.    Well, I'll take his word for it.  But from my perspective, I give Asian Village a thumbs up, regardless.    Despite the somewhat dingy +15 stretch this establishment finds itself in, it remains a solid choice for noon-hour sustenance.    Others, it seems, agree.    There are two other \"Asian\" places nearby, but this one consistently has the customers lining up.   And for good reason:  the name of the game here is variety.  Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, sushi...   the menus on the wall are divided up accordingly.   I've been working my way through, and nothing has disappointed.  In fact, most meals have been very good, to excellent.    From the pho to the Chinese buffet, Asian Village has typically exceeded offerings from similar establishments elsewhere.  My only minor complaint is that the sushi case is sparsely populated.   Just a few takeout trays in an otherwise empty case.    I like to grab sushi once a week, or so, and it would be nice to have more variety this close to work.   However, I'm guessing sushi is not a big seller, which is why they don't bother.  It's too easy to get tempted by the hot food here, and walk right past the sushi case.  I guess I do it all the time,"}
{"text":"Asian Village Wok and Grill is on the +15 past Nexen, heading towards Husky.  It is an Asian Fusion type place that has menus that include chinese, japanese, sushi, thai and even a mongolie grill.  I actually try to avoid this place as much as possible, because the chinese food buffet is irresistable to me at this location.  A girl should only eat so much fried food, but Asian Village Wok seems to get my business once a month or so.  A little more often on those months where the pressure is really on, and I need some comfort food. :)  The fact that I find them irresistable is a HUGE compliment to them, because there are 3 asian food buffets on the +15 in each and every direction of the Nexen building.  But... this one is my fave.    I am not here to bash the competition, but I do have solid reasons for choosing Asian Village over some of the others in proximity to my office.  \"the food is always cooked\" I know this should be a given, but I am a lunatic for dissecting chinese food before I eat it.  it has happened to me, more than once, where the bigger pieces of lemon chicken or ginger beef have not been cooked.  This has NEVER happened to me at Asian Village Wok, and I have been working at Nexen for five years.  So, that's a pretty stellar track record with me.  \"the owner is always on site\" This restaurant is not run by a hired manager.  The local owner is always there.  He works the till and he is always friendly, chatty and as a result, everyone else is cooking and serving food.  Maybe the fact he is always there, is the reason why the food is always good.  You know what they say... when the cat is away, the mouse will play.  :)  Not at Asian Village Wok and Grill.  \"The food is consistent\" I have my favorites on their menu, and every time I order them, they always taste good AND the food tastes the same as the last time I had it.  That makes it a favorite... not a crap shoot.  \"They are flexible\" When I am indulging myself in chinese food, I try and at least ask for veggies instead of white rice.  I'm already consuming an inordinate amount of deep fried goodness.  Therefore, they are flexible with me to trade the white rice for a bed of vegetables at no extra charge.  Some of my favorites on their menu - Chow mein curry noodles - Lemon chicken - Ginger beef - Coconut Curry Chicken  If you are wandering the +15s, starving, on the west side of downtown, give Asian Village Wok and Grill a try."}
{"text":"A few days ago I found myself needing to buy lunch downtown and my coworker took me to the magical Asian Village.  It's a counter style place that has lots of different Vietnamese and Chinese options so naturally I was excited!  I got veggie  sate soup, with extra veggies my most favourite  thing of all.  The extra veggies weren't really visible but I don't fault them for that because they made up this soup on the fly (it's not on the ms up). It had three huge pieces of tofu, delicious spicy peanut sate and I think it was cheap, like $9.  Friendly staff and quick service!"}
