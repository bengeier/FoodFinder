{"text":"The food was great and I loved the ordering process where you check off what you want on the bag your sandwich will be in. There was a huge sandwich selection too!"}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich shop in charlotte. Used to frequent one in nashville, so glad they followed me here!!! Delicious, and plenty of choices. It is a must try."}
{"text":"Which wich is our go to sandwich shop now. Luckily my wife works near so she can grab some on the way home. Perfect dinner at the ball park when watching our kid play little league.  Wish they had a shop closer to home but I'm sure it's in the future. Good Place."}
{"text":"Finally got chance to visit this place.  Ordered the small italian sub with wheat bread.  It was delish.  The meats were fresh.  Good service and food.  Price was right too."}
{"text":"The food was decent but incredibly overpriced and I'm not even sure I got all the ingredients I had selected for my sandwich. To put it in short, I wouldn't go back just because of the price alone."}
{"text":"Love the sandwich. However Aloha our order taker could use some developing. Never smiled, never looked at us, never thanked and had a frown the entire time. Did get a thanks by one of the guys while leaving."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich by far!  As far as the sandwiches, they are fantastic.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was for what has happened to this location.  It started out great when they first opened.  Plenty of workers, very friendly and eager to assist people who hadn't been to the restaurant before.  Fast forward to now, and things have gone down hill.  Again, the sandwiches are still VERY good so no complaints there at all.  As far as the things that have been lacking lately:  1)  The TV on the wall hasn't been on in months...kind of nice to watch a game or something while you eat or wait for your order.  2) They had a spot on each bag for hot/cold sandwich and one day just took that option off and made all sandwiches hot.  Why take the option off the bag?  Now they have hand-written notes by where you order that tell you all sandwiches are hot.  You can still just write COLD on the bag and get one cold, so why on earth would the higher powers at Which Wich take that option off the bag.  Very confusing and a real pain when you forget to write COLD on the bag.  Having the option reminded us to check which one we wanted.  3)  The bathrooms have had OUT OF ORDER signs on them for weeks now.  Haven't tried to use them, so not sure if they truly are out of order or not, but what an inconvenience for someone who might need them to be out that long.  Very weird.  4)  Seems like the number of employees have really gone down.  In the other day (we go in at least once a week) and there were only two people there.  One who was a regular employee that we recognized and a second new person.  The sandwiches really got backed up when the new person was making them and the other person was on the register.  5)  As I've noticed in other comments, employees are just not that friendly any longer.  Sometimes no communication at all when you order or pick up your sandwich.  Not the end of the world, but come on...friendly is better.  6)  Lastly, our favorite sandwich is the Italian.  Again, for weeks now, they have ran out of Italian bags and haven't ordered more.  Not a huge deal for us since we go there on a regular basis, but VERY confusing for newer people when they want an Italian sandwich....it has to be explained to them to grab any other bag and write Italian on it and the type of sandwich.  What makes this worse is the un-friendly employees (who act like they really don't want to be working there) that don't explain this to people very well...basically in as few words as possible.  Not good customer service.

Still love this place because the sandwiches are THAT good!  Just wish the owner would invest a little in getting more employees so the wait is not as long for sandwiches when they are busy.  And get friendlier and more helpful employees.  And would it hurt to get the TV and restrooms working again?  And for crying out loud, order more Italian sandwich bags!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Best choice of toppings and sides. Have eaten here at least five times before and never had an order that wasn't great and prepared the way I asked."}
{"text":"We randomly decided to grab lunch here and we do not regret it. It was our first time at Which Wich and we found the ordering process great. The choices were great. The staff was fantastic and our sandwiches super yummy."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent sandwiches - house chips were very good - highly recomend - only downsize was the roving bus boys that kept interupting our coversation - seemed like they were hurrying us"}
{"text":"Good menu choices for food, toppings and condiments. Lack of bread choices, only white and wheat. 
Staff very helpful and nice.

Problem is the false advertising of sandwich sizes. Ordered two 7\" subs to go but one was just barely 6\" and the other was 5\".  Don't advertise 7\" if not going to deliver 7\"."}
{"text":"Well maybe it's because  they are new and still ironing out the kinks but they have been open for at least a month now so as far as in concerned they should be past the rookie stage. Place was sloooooow. Sandwiches were no better than a subway or quiznos. And to top it off, they failed on 2 of our 4 orders TWICE!!  TWICE! That's 4 failed attempts folks! And, I saw other orders being brought back as well. Maybe that explains why it was so slow, all the remakes.
Don't order a kids grilled cheese btw. Even my kid laughed at it. Literally, no cheese in between. Plus, you mark the \"white American cheese\" slot, yet the manager tells me, when I request white American for my wife's sandwich, that they don't  use white American. When I questioned about the white American selection on the kids gr. cheese, he said its mozzarella!!! Nothing at all like white American!!! Are you kidding me here folks? This place will be gone within 6 months. Any takers?"}
{"text":"I agree with Jess on the service being slow. The staff didn't seem to be happy at working at all. No greeting, and they seem to be very pissed off when im asking questions about the sandwiches. I ordered a BLT sandwich, it was a-ok. a little bit better than a Subway's BLT (i think its bigger, but more pricey)"}
{"text":"Good service. I don't think the taste warrants the prices. Plus I have to fill out my entire order? That's why I'm eating out - for a delicious pre-made sandwich. Overall good food, I just disagree with the delivery"}
{"text":"Best. Sandwich. Shop. EVER! I love everything about Which Wich!! So many options for anybody's taste. I've been waiting for this place to open up...so glad it finally did, I see many lunch breaks at Which Wich!!

Thanks for finally coming to Scottsdale!!!!!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the hood, Which Wich! You are a welcome addition to our lunch line up.

How it works: a station of paper sandwich bags is up front. Pick your wich: vegetarian, beef, ham, chicken, seafood, or the wicked (many meats and cheeses!). Choose the corresponding bag and check the boxes on the bag for the toppings of your choice. There are many unique toppings to choose from, all the standard stuff plus olive salad, carmelized onions, dried cranberries, spicy sauces... The list is huge! Most are free of charge. Take your bag up to the cashier and check out!

The verdict: good stuff! We especially liked the house chips. The bread was pretty average. A few toppings got lost in translation from bag to sandwich maker, I'll attribute that to this being a new restaurant. It's a bit noisy inside so we preferred their patio seating. 

Good new spot! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is usually my favorite sandwich place. Went in today and they changed the bags that you order on. Removed the skinny option and no hot or cold option. I asked about the skinny option and they said just write it on the bag. Didn't ask about the hot or cold and got my sandwich back toasted, which I hate. Then I heard them tell someone else they are all toasted now and you have to ask for cold. Again, why not leave the option on the bag along with the skinny option if you have to ask for things still? Doesn't make sense."}
{"text":"OMG. I've had several great sandwiches from here over the past few months, but my favorites are the Bahn MI (which they no longer serve, dang it ) and the Monte Cristo, (which is AMAZING ). SO GOOD, I WILL DRIVE 30 MINUTES ACROSS TOWN TO GET MY FIX! ! I order with extra mayo and grape jelly and get it warm.  So happy to have this as a regular option.  Now all you need to do is make my Bahn Mi a regular option, too."}
{"text":"Too many sandwiches to choose from--everything is great! Check out the R&D sandwich first...typically this is a homerun!! Sometimes it can take a good 10 minutes to get your order, but always worth the wait. Also, they'll \"skinny\" your sandwich for you to knock off calories (scoop out some of the bread in the sandwich)! House chips are super delicious, too!!"}
{"text":"Changed my review, the owner contacted me and invited me back. Promised that I would have a better experience, I did. An owner who values the customer and takes pride in overall customer experience! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I am always in and out quick with their speedy service & the employees are always pleasant to converse with. I often get a different sandwich every time I have been in & it is always accurate, fresh, & filling. With the amount of meat they put on their sandwiches it really puts other sub shops to shame (*cough*cough*Subway*cough*)! A ton of options to pick from & you're always going to get a great tasting 'wich!"}
{"text":"They have vegetarian and vegan sandwiches here and not just a lettuce and tomato sandwich!!!
Black bean burgers, hummus, veggies, and the white bread ALL VEGAN !!!! Black bean burger is pretty tasty, it taste more homemade than a frozen patty at a competitors place that rhymes with tubway :) I got all the veggies I could get, added dijon mustard, avacodo (extra charge), and hummus and it tasted pretty good!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service, very pro-active! They were fast and asked questions to make my Wich the best tasting instead of just how I ordered it. (I almost put mayo and mustard on a French dip. That woulda been super weird. I was totally not thinking! Too used to ordering regular sandwiches.) The Wich was skinny looking but was very filling. Overall, I would definetly come back!"}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly service. Always good food and fast. I go here about once a week  shakes are great also. Try the cookie shake."}
{"text":"Messed up three things on a four person order. It's written on the receipt... And the food is sub par at best."}
{"text":"Good place but a little pricey imo... Great service but i think i'll stick to jimmy johns or subway..."}
{"text":"I placed an online order only to show up at the store to have it not even started on.  This was the second time at this location that this has happened.  I now had to sit in the store for about 10 minutes while they made my sandwhiches.  The sandwhiches were tasty but, they need to work on this problem."}
{"text":"I tried this place out a few months back and have been there 3 times now and it has yet to disappoint.  I have only had the hot sandwhiches and they have been good. I really like that i can picm whatever i want on it without feeling rushed by people behind me in line. Fiiling out that paper bag for what you want to eat is great idea. Sandwiches seem to take awhile to make but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Eh. Was ok, definitely not as superior as the guys behind the counter proclaimed it would be.  Having a wider selection of toppings doesn't equate to a better sandwich. Still liking Potbelly the best for flavor and atmosphere.

The ordering process seems a bit gimmicky but if it saves times waiting for others to figure out what to ask for, then its ok I guess.

I liked the choice of 3 sizes for the bread."}
{"text":"To start I do want to point out that I very much like the food at Which Wich, however there are a few issues that I have with them.

First off being that they don't really adhere to the hours that they say they're open. The main Which Wich site says this location in open till 9, and here on Yelp till only 8:30. A little consistency would be great. If either of those times are accurate about when they close, why did I roll up to the store right after 8pm and find them closed? If you're supposed to be open to a certain time, 9 or 8:30 still needs to be determined, then you should actually stay open for the people who would like to eat your food.

Second issue is indeed the cost. As I said I do really like their sandwiches and will buy them, but only once in awhile when I crave them(so to go to the store and see it closed when it shouldn't be just adds a little more to that pile). However I would come back and eat here more if(they're open) the pricing was more reasonable.

Third issue is after you manage to get to the store while they're open, and pay for your expensive sandwich, you then have to wait for a strangely long time to receive your meal. Every time I've come to this location it's take about 10 minutes to get my sandwich. It's a sandwich...why does it take that long?

Sometimes if one really likes something they'll over look certain things and continue to enjoy that but this is ridiculous. Get it together Which Wich."}
{"text":"Best sandwich down town hands down, perfectly toasted very consistent, awesome French bread, the variety is infinite. Great work, I am finally proud to eat sandwiches downtown again."}
{"text":"The order process is slow and quirky ...Where's the beef? I ordered the Cuban it tasted pretty good but really light on the meat."}
{"text":"Came here at 7:00, big mistake! Took me 15 minutes to get my sandwich. Not the workers fault,  it was just that every family in North Scottsdale was there! Besides this, the sandwiches were fantastic! The price is fairly good. Also, is it just me, or do they have the best ice? The food was fantastic, the ice was fantastic, but DON'T come here during the 7:00 hour...not pretty."}
{"text":"I just went into Which Which for the first time ever today. I obviously looked confused and one of the employees was standing by the bags and helped me figure out what to do. He told me about the popular sandwiches too...so many options! I ordered, got my food and was out pretty quickly. The flow of the order process was slick and seem less. We will definitely be back to try out more of their sandwiches!! Thanks for a great experience!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite sandwich place! We will always come here when we are craving a sandwich. Daniel & Nick are especially great and super friendly! They really care about customers' needs and want to make sure we get what we want. We will be returning again and again!"}
{"text":"Average sandwiches 

Over-priced

Bad bad location.   No signage  hidden.    You could drive right by it and miss it.  

Ordering system is not visual.  I desire to see what I eat.  

Over-priced with no return factor."}
{"text":"I was slightly intimidated when I first entered, but there were people at the paper bag area and I followed their lead.  The Vegetarian sub was very good.  I was surprised by all the additions you could pick.  Almost every veggie plus, cranberries, walnuts, spinach, salad dressings, mustards, and 3 types of onions.  I will definitely make the drive out to Solon more often. It brought a smile to my face to see the Elvis sub! This is a place I will recommend."}
{"text":"I have experienced better.  Is it bad? No. Does it blow you away?  Jury's out. Maybe I just got the wrong sandwich.

Went on a Saturday afternoon on the way to a movie.  First thing I see is an employee on break out front.  Relaxed, casual atmosphere.  We were first timers here.  It matters.  We see a menu wall and slots with numbered bags.  I'm not an attention whore when it comes to customer service.  Just give me the basics.  Kinda felt ignored.  Don't get me wrong, I hate that forced greeting you get from employees at other places we know.  But I kinda miss getting acknowledged.  My sister finally walked to the counter area and asked exactly how do you order here?  You'd think there would be something clear to nudge you along.  We get our confidence and I get the featured cheese steak, she gets the wicked. Cool sounding names for sandwiches. To the point: Hers tasted great to her.  It was good, I tried it. Mine, not so much. Really poor quality beef, that was assuredly kept in some kind of hot liquid that only kept it hot, not moist and leached it of all intended flavor while likely increasing the saltiness.  Portion wise she got some value; taste etc.  Mine was half the size of hers with little redemptive traits.  It had an adequate amount of the chewy meat but very little of any of the other ingredients. I do remember a mushroom.  Overall quality of meats cheeses above average, bread just ok. 
Something to rave over? (shoulder shrug). Food was just okay. Cleanliness, maybe the guy on break could have wiped off some, any of the inside tables? Just saying.  Staff was friendly enough but at no time seemed concerned about the appearance of the dining room. Concept design more appealing to a specific group of people: the ones that like to walk into a place on their phone, order food, pick it up, eat etc while never leaving the comfort of their phone.  Human interaction is not a priority.  I probably don't get it and the sting of a $23 dollar tab on some sandwiches and sodas is a little off-putting. Would I go back again?  Nothing was really wrong, but then again, nothing was really right either."}
{"text":"Good food. Horrible wait. Usually it's 20 to 40 minute wait. Online ordering does not work so give yourself at least an hour for lunch for this place."}
{"text":"People behind the counter are so busy watching football that they forgot things that should go in my sandwich, didn't give house chips when asked they gave them with a rude look. Would not prefer this place again."}
{"text":"Somewhat slow service, expected with new staff though. Sandwich took about 15 mins to get, but was fairly tasty, if not a bit messily constructed. Nothing earth-shattering but exceptional choices, this menu runs deep! The bread is good, too. Overall I think it just needs some time to come into its own."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. I ordered food through Uber Eats and received less than half of my order. I called the restaurant and was told that my order was \"put into two different orders\". I stated that it was all within one order. The individual then stated \"I'm not saying that you're wrong, but we gave you what was ordered\". She then asked for my phone number to call me back once she figured out what happened. After not hearing anything we went to the restaurant where we were told the driver picked up the remaining order. She stated the driver was on his way bringing the remaining items. Unfortunately, the driver still did not pick up the entire order so we picked up the missing items. Upon getting home, we realized the driver had not actually delivered the food. Overall, disappointing experience to say the least. But what is most disappointing is the absolute lack of customer service, accountability, and ownership. Never once did we receive an apology, nor did I ever receive a call back. We will never be visiting this establishment again."}
{"text":"First time I ate here was at the one in Matthews. I wasn't to fond of my sandwich. It was my fault to say the least. This time I ask the cashier what he would recommend. My sandwich was so good. He even gave me a free cup. Everything was fresh. I will definitely be back with coworkers next time."}
{"text":"I got the Gyro and my husband got the Ruben. It was ok nothing special. The bread on my gyro was really soggy. The only good thing were the chips. Not coming here again. The Ruben was supposed to be got and a lot of the meat was cold."}
{"text":"Awesome. 
Setup is confusing until you figure it out; but once you figure it out, it is a super smart layout and process. 
Prices are pretty high and wait was pretty long, but we were in no rush. 
Sandwich was fantastic.
If you're not in a hurry, this is probably the best sub shop ever."}
{"text":"The newest sandwich place in the neighbourhood and i already know multiple reasons I'll be back...the multiple combinations I still need to try. They have a very cute way to make selections on the bag , the buffalo chicken sandwich I ordered was yummy. Im certainly going to be back. And hey this way i'll manage to get the 10 th sandwich free :)"}
{"text":"Have been frequenting the location up on north Scottsdale Rd. for about ten months now.  In fact, I can honestly say I'm addicted to it.  Out of all the sandwiches I've consumed there, 99% are the \"Italian Grinder\" loaded with all the Hot Stuff. Hooked right from the start.   

By far,  much better sub than the competition (Haven't tried Jimmy Johns yet).  Approx. $8 for small, with drink and that is plenty to fill me up.  Ordering is a little daunting the first trip in but the order process allows you to design your own creation.  Note: Best when served Hot!

On first name basis with Scott, the manager (go figure). Great guy that truly loves his job and his customers.  Clean establishment and great quality food!"}
{"text":"15 min for a sub with 3 ppl in front of me?! Nope! Understaffed! My spouse went to chipotle but the line was too long so i went to which which since there were almost no one inside. He finished his plate and i still had to wait another 10 min. Staff was nice but the wait was crazy"}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches that taste and look fresh. Will be back when I need a good sandwich!"}
{"text":"What a great change of pace!  So much better than the Quiznos that was there.  If you go, try the Bacon, Egg and Cheese.  Even though it has bacon pieces and not strips it is still great!  Wife really liked the veggie."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and I like their veggie black bean patty sandwich. I love it !!

So if you don't add too many sauces then it taste too awsome."}
{"text":"Love the subs here. The Oreo shake is AMAZING! Service is a little slow so expect to wait a bit, and parking is difficult to find. They also have a hole punch card so if you go enough you can earn a free sub."}
{"text":"This is a great sub place. I love sandwiches and this is one of my choices to go if I want a good sub. The sizes of the subs are perfect. Have yet to try the 14\" inch but if you are really hungry, but don't want to go to over board, then the 10\" is perfect. I love the selection of veggies and condiments to choose from. Caramelized onions...Yes please. Over all, this place is winner. When ever me and my g/f want a sandwich, this is usually our first choice."}
{"text":"Quick and delicious! I ordered online and pick up was a breeze. All the sandwiches were correct and SO YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I go there all the time!  I love the customizable sandwiches you can create!"}
{"text":"Cute place with good sandwiches. Great concept and reasonable prices. Overall an easy place for lunch."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick sandwich. It does take a little bit to understand how to order, but there was a employee ready to help!"}
{"text":"I didn't know it was possible to put sadness on bread. I've had better experiences at the DMV. I order a tuna sandwich, which barely had any tuna on it and was charged $7 to be disappointed. 

I'm a man of simple pleasures and don't ever write Yelp reviews but how sad and miserable this experience was, I felt not only compelled but morally obligated to warn others not to experience this travesty that is an eatery. I would give it 0 stars if possible."}
{"text":"Hang with me here..... I had a vertebrate paleontology class in college.  Our professor often discussed the lack of evolutionary changes in crocodilian species over the course of millions of years while other species have evolved all sorts of other features.  He basically said \"it's not possible to do what they do any better.  A bigger brain means they'd probably lose jaw muscle.  Larger body size means they'd probably lose some of their ability to sneak up on prey.  Over the course of millions of years, these things would be a big deal.\"  Point being, crocodiles haven't evolved because they're perfect as is for what they do.  Well, for what it is, Which Wich does a perfect job.

Tons of options, all completely customizeable, fairly fast service, high quality ingredients, toasting capabilities, inexpensive, friendly staff that aren't afraid to interact with their customers, etc.  Perfect lunch spot.  It can get crowded (obviously a good problem to have), so come during off hours or plan on getting it to go."}
{"text":"Super good. Fresh ingredients, crunchy soft bread, and amazing taste! My go to place when I'm around :))"}
{"text":"Unfortunately it seems I'm addicted to this place. Their sandwiches are disgustingly good and their shakes could kill someone with their epicness. The guys and sometimes girls that work there are cool, get my stuff made pretty quickly and always delicious. I've never left unhappy. Tho I seem to be stuck on the buffalo chicken sandwich with every paper possible! I really don't tho k you could go wrong."}
{"text":"I love sub sandwiches, so I was excited to try Which Wich. I do like that you can order what you want on a piece of paper, but I was a little disappointed for the hype that this place got. The sub was merely okay - nothing too different from the subs I've had before. It wasn't bad by any means, but it is smaller than subs from other places and also more expensive. I went here once and haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff!  Always great service with good sandwiches. The ordering processing is simple and effective. 

Try the house chips and black bean patty!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! The pulled pork sandwich (#8) will have you licking your fingers. With the #8 you can do the regular, southwestern or build your own. I built my own and even after being somewhat conservative with topping options the sandwich was still better than any from this type of eatery that I've had in years. Because it took a little longer to build my custom wich (Maybe 3-4 minutes) they gave me a card for a free wich on my next visit. Excellent customer service! In the style of a line from a well known movie - I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to come here for so long! It was tasty, but I expected something more. A couple people I'd talked to had chalked it up to be a little better. The bread was good, kind of skimpy on everything else though. The employees just didn't seem interested. I'd probably come back and try again."}
{"text":"Shit show at lunch. If you want to wait close to 30 mins for one sandwich and watch them all yell at each other this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"A little pricey quality not the best..probably a good place to bring kids. But I like telling someone what to put on my sandwich and the order taker asked which Wich did I want..went home found it had nothing on it...always read the fine print..."}
{"text":"We visited Which Wich at San Tan Marketplace about a month ago. It was wonderful! I meant to post this review then, but just got busy and forgot. Oops! But our experience was so great, I just had to come back and review anyways. The whole sandwich customization concept is great! The brown bag/sharpie process is super efficient and actually, kind of fun! :) But beyond the yummy sandwich, I was really impressed by the service. Namely, by a kid named Alex. When we got our sandwich, I mentioned to my husband that I wanted to sit outside on one of their few patio tables. Unfortunately, so did everyone else and there were no open tables. So, we just grabbed a table inside. Well, a minute or two later, this gentleman, Alex, came up to us and said that a family is leaving the patio and their table should be ready in just a second. He must have just overheard us talking about it and offered a solution without being asked. EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE! He even offered to refill our drinks for us. We've since been back and hope to run into Alex again soon! If Alex's manager is reading this, please give that kid a raise! :)"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!  But why does it take so long?  This is my second visit and it took more than nine (09) minutes with no line for them to prepare my sandwich. How long would it take during a rush???  Quality product, a bit long to wait for food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I regularly go to Which Wich. So many options to choose from and the fact that they have breakfast sandwiches all day is awesome. Staff is always friendly and the sandwich punch card is a nice perk too!"}
{"text":"So disappointed with the food we received today. Our kids meal arrived with the apple brown and hacked to pieces yet still had huge chunks of core attached? I had to re-slice it just to feed it to my dogs, much less my child. My own sandwich had soggy browning lettuce that was scarcely scattered across. Ended up scraping it off and only having a few bites. The young men working seemed to be distracted by socializing with friends and it definitely showed in the huge waste of money my order turned out to be. Sad to say I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Ok I'm so back to loving this place!  Seeing some newer faces and smiling ones at that!"}
{"text":"Which-Wich has a great sandwich selection and a very friendly staff. The ingredients always seem to be very fresh. I love coming for an early lunch to beat the lunch crowd as they open at 10:30am."}
{"text":"This is an interesting sub shop.  You write your order on the bag with your name....hard to mess that up.  I still prefer Jersey Mike's where they cut the meat right onto your sandwich, however, this place is convienent and they have a lot of variety.  My kids love the bags."}
{"text":"I love this place very clever way of ordering.

A bit pricey but, once in a while I treat myself."}
{"text":"A much better option than Subway for a quick sandwich. Many options for customization."}
{"text":"I work near this location and since it has been open i have been there multiple times... Food and services have been great every time! 

How to order takes a little getting used to, but when you get it figured out your good!

When you order a cookie it comes out warm and gooey, would def recommend getting one.. and if you fill out the survey (details on the bottom of your receipt) they will give you a free cookie!  

I would say that if your in the area stop in and grab some lunch!!"}
{"text":"Love Which Wich and love this location especially! I choose this over Jimmy Johns any day! The hot chicken pesto is my go-to sub, but I like a lot of their choices. The bread is delicious when toasted, and the 'regular' size sub is always filling. And don't get me started on the hand-dipped chocolate shakes! So good!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best sandwiches I've had. Place is clean, service is great, and food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I returned today to Which Wich, only because I had a coupon for a free sandwich that they provide for your birthday. It was a good thing that it was free or else I wouldn't have gone back. I did however and I spoke with the assistant manager and shared my experience with him from a few days back. He assured me that that's not the way they typically handle things and they would certainly like to earn my business and would like to know how they can earn my business back. The way the young man handled the situation was very professional and I appreciated it. The fact that he was open to listen to some constructive critique spoke volumes and I feel that they have earned my business back by being willing to listen. The sandwiches are good, there's no denying that."}
{"text":"This place is always busy and I understand they are busy but every time I ordered they take ten or more minutes.  And they miss an ingredient I liked their sub but all the wait and missing ingredients isn't worthwhile.  Also the cashiers aways leave the area when I am about to order to do something else. Horrible"}
{"text":"We were here on a Wednesday afternoon around 2:00.  The place was almost deserted.  The ordering process was explained by a young man who was very pleasant.  We ordered and than sat down to wait.  Every table but two had trash, crumbs, or was just dirty.  I can honestly say that no matter how good the sandwich was I had already decided that I would never come back.  Three young people behind the counter and no one came out to clean up.  One came to refill his soda.  The sandwiches were only mediocre.  Subway or Blimpy is way better.  Skip this one."}
{"text":"Since starting to work in Ballantyne about two years ago I've liked Which Wich, sorta Subway but better tasting and more options.  Today though I went over and found out they 1) changed the bag layout, 2) removed several options and 3) raised prices without updating signage.  

The bag layout takes a second to get used too but really isn't that bad and removing options means I can't have my favorite sub anymore but the sub I got was still good, the big issue was upping the prices.  With the crossfit studio next door generating lots of noise, parking a nightmare, insane sodium levels in the food and the recent changes the overall experience is now one to avoid."}
{"text":"Best sandwich in Madison! 

The selection of sandwiches and toppings is pretty much endless here, and they always make your sandwich to-order, so it can take a while sometimes because it can be a long process just to pick what you want on your sandwich (let alone have them make it fresh!)....but the flavor is absolutely worth it!!! 

Great quality, fairly priced. Usually I go with medium-sized meals anywhere I eat, but the medium sandwich here is HUGE (hence the $8 price tag that comes along with it)! I usually go with the small unless I'm famished. 

I haven't had anything here that I didn't like, but if you're having trouble picking something out, the staff here is really helpful!  I recommend the Grinder (Italian sub). 

I load mine up with: 
Caramelized onions
Crispy onion strings
Lettuce
Tomato
Hot pepper mix
Olive salad
Oregano
Garlic
Vinegar 

MmmmmMmMmmmmMmm!!"}
{"text":"Ordered from this place twice and both times they didn't bring everything I ordered. As far as the food taste, it's really good"}
{"text":"Which Wich is an awesome place! The sandwiches are extremely filling and huge! They come in 3 different sandwich sizes and you can pick what you want on your sandwiches. The staff is friendly and definitely fast service. One of my faves is The Wicked! Definitely will be eating here quite often."}
{"text":"Great service, huge variety of sandwiches. Everything has been great... we tried the Wicked, the Reuben, and the Pulled Pork was amazing with so much pork. Recommend you try the sandwiches hot!"}
{"text":"I LOVED the Which Wich back in Mississippi, so I was so happy when they opened a new location in Champaign! We stopped in for dinner for the first time, and to be honest I was disappointed. The service was slow, no one greeted us, (In fact, they did not seem very happy that we were there at all!) and they did not get my order right. I just chalked it up to inexperience. We may give them another shot after they've been open for a little longer. We shall see."}
{"text":"They have so many options to choose from it almost made my head hurt, but then I thought about how convenient that is. I loved the process of customizing your sandwich before hitting the counter and the options to choose a bowl or lettuce wrap. Great concept and it works!"}
{"text":"Not worth the effort to drive here.  A sandwich place with 8 active workers should not have any customer back up or order confusion.  I've seen other places operate with more efficiency with 4 employees during a lunch rush.  The guy's whose job it was to put the finished sandwich in a bag and say the customers name could learn to enunciate or at least not show up to work high."}
{"text":"I have seen a lot of improvements since this place opened.  I remember long wait times my first time here but this visit during the lunch rush was right on par with similar types of sub shops.

They have a neat concept of filling out questions on a paper bag (later your sub bag) to place your order.  I had the roast beef sub and it was good, not dry and reasonable priced."}
{"text":"They're doing things a bit different at Which Wich. If Subway and Chipotle had a baby, it would be Which Wich. You walk in and are jobbing-it with an array of bags, pens, numbers and choices. It can be so overwhelming that they have a dedicated employee who welcomes you and asks if you've been through the assembly line before. Me? Oh, I've done the run-through (but secretly need to read the board each time I arrive). But today was different. Today was my free birthday wich, and I was on a mission!

Turkey Club time! Like their father (Chipotle), you choose a genre: The sandwich with bread, bowlwich or lettucewich. Then, like Mama Subway, you choose the fixins. But, this is where they stand out. With creative innards like crushed potato chips, crispy onion strings, or crushed blue cheese ... they're rockin' the sandwich! Good stuff, and slightly different each time. 

Now for the cost. In my humble opinion, a sandwich is exclusively the goods between bread. That's it; there is no bowl or lettuce wrap. These are many things, but a sandwich they are not. So, a 7\" sub is $5.50; a 10.5\" sub is $8.25; and the monster 14\" behemoth is $11 bucks. Perhaps a little pricey. But, not too bad, given the amount of flexibility in the sandwich. However, their rewards point system works on the number of subs purchased. Now, I'm no math wizard, but two 7\" subs seems to cost the same as one 14\". To me, the 14\" is much more reasonable (and attractive) if under $10 -- not to mention the rewards points.

The taste was -- dare I say -- better than Subway? Oh yes, better than the chain-o-matic sandwich shops. I'm a fan of putting everything and the kitchen sink between the fresh bread, toasting the whole thing, and enjoying it with good company. Top the whole thing off with a freshly baked cookie...And like an elderly Arnold Schwarzenegger, I'll be back! Lunch is served."}
{"text":"The sandwich filling options are good, but the bread is dry, crumbly, and tastes mass produced. With options like milio's and Jimmy john's so close by with much better bread, it's hard to justify paying so much for a sandwich here."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence about this place. They're very creative as far as ordering with the order bags and all. The atmosphere is fine except not at noon where you cant stand anywhere without someone poking your leg. The subs are good BUT they are defiantly not worth the price. I ordered a meatball (surprise right?). Anyways, I ordered the large and it was almost $10.00. I don't mind paying $10.00 for a good sub but this one as far as size was less than average of what a large should be. As far as the actual sandwich it was tasty but not filling and not worth $10.00, I'll maybe come back if im in the area and not that hungry."}
{"text":"Used to love this location, little problems here or there that were easily fixed but I think I'm done with them. This last time was AWFUL. They made my bowlwhich wrong four times. At the third, I asked for a refund and the employee said he couldn't do that. Finally it came out right, got halfway through eating it and found an ant on a pepper, threw it away at that point. 20 minutes later I was throwing up and am now lying in bed miserable. THANKS, I'll just go to Subway next time."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich shop! Traveled here for business and it was a good place to grab a quick bit.  Would recommend to any business traveler!"}
{"text":"My favorite sub place. They are all very tasty! Another thing I love about this place is that every employee is so nice. Never seen happier and politer people working. I go here at least 3 times a week and it's been great every time"}
{"text":"Love the idea of marking up your own bag--like Sacks but without the hassle of asking, \"What comes on that?\" I really enjoyed my sandwich (Club) and will definitely come back to try the malt."}
{"text":"Free sub?! What a joke!! Apparently the \"Buy 10 Wiches, Get one free\" has now changed to \"Buy 11 Wiches, carry 2 punch cards, and get the 12th Wich free\". #RipOffArtists"}
{"text":"High quality ingredients, an interesting ordering system, and a free cookie with a receipt showing you completed a survey from last time?  Good deal.  A little pricey for a sandwich, but better than all the other sandwich places around"}
{"text":"First time here sandwiches FANTASTIC! More than expected & delicious. Total experience ruined when the manager Jill started hollering at her staff twice. Jill was yelling at the top of her lungs at her employees as she was standing beside my table and a table full of teens. I could see the expression on two of the employees faces... NOT GOOD. NOT COOL AT ALL.
I was so shocked at her lack of leadership and horrible representation of this company. Absolutely I interrupted her as and was yelling and told her that her behavior was total unacceptable. I then asked her name and asked to speak to the manager. She then identified herself as the manager. She did stop yelling after I confronted her. Afterwards one if the teens turned to me and thanked me for saying something. 
I also must add this place was packed with people at the time she add yelling and reprimanding her staff. Shame on you Jill. Shame on you."}
{"text":"Great place to stop and grab a quick lunch or dinner.  I love the lettuce wich and one of the girls here makes an amazing sandwich!  The staff is always friendly and it is a clean restaurant!  We usually go around 6-7 Pm an have never experience long waits and the staff is usually pretty quick but I would rather it take some time if its good!"}
{"text":"First time eating here, my boyfriend loves the place and recommended it to me so I said Why not. I got the buffalo chicken which and it was B-O-M-B. Seriously this place trumps subway by a ton, plus their cookies really tie up a really good meal. Definitely recommend and I'm definitely going back :)"}
{"text":"It was not a pleasant experience.  The sub was extremely dry, very stingy on ingredients & they forgot the cheese on my Philly cheese steak.  Enough said."}
{"text":"sandwich place that does not know how to make a sandwich.  Lets say a place that sells slices of pie, lets call it \"pie pie\" If they were anything like Which Wich you would order a slice of apple pie and the waiter would say all am going to bring you is an apple unless you tell me how to make an apple pie. Terrible!"}
{"text":"We ate lunch here. The system to order is simple and efficient. VThe server was friendly and knowledgeable. However the tables were filthy and the floors looked dirty. The Rueben sandwich wasn't served on Rye bread is like  Cuban not served on Cuban bread. The sandwich was tasty. Prices are steep for submarine sandwich shop."}
{"text":"51 something options for samiches or for those who want be sticklers, Sandwiches.  

You build exactly what you want every time by either starting their pre selected combinations(i,e pizza, club, or rueben) and modifying on your brown paper bag/order card. Or, you can make your own amazing Wich from scratch.    Their pineapple milkshakes are good too!"}
{"text":"Went in today and got a cold sub. Bread seemed like it was just thawed out from the freezer and then had meat slapped on it. Cappacola was dry, similar to brisket. Overall disappointing since I have seen this place do better."}
{"text":"First of all, I really dig the ordering system.  You fill out a form on a paper bag and just hand it to the guy at the counter.  It is so much more efficient that way.  On top of that, the sandwich was pretty good.  Not the best I ever had, but better than your average chain.  I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Cool concept, decent prices , still prefer Quiznos. Service was great and location is even better.  I would go there again in a pinch. Recommend everyone try it at Least once"}
{"text":"So many choices, and it all looked so good. Mine was very tasty and the staff was friendly and helpful. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to Huntersville's Birkdale village.  It's located just south of the theater where Quiznos used to be.  Easy parking even when Birkdale is busy.  Great Lunch food...sandwiches, salads even shakes  etc....   It's about time we get some new fresh idea's for lunch restaurants around here other than sushi...."}
{"text":"Similar to subway, jimmy johns, it's a chain.  No chain should get above a 2 in my opinion.  The ordering system is lame.  The sandwiches are normal for a chain.

The selection of vegetables is pretty thin.  It's a lousy sub that mushes in your mouth."}
{"text":"Which Wich is my Wich?  Honestly, I love all of 'em! 

The thing that sets Which Wich apart from the rest isn't just the fun brown paper bags where you fill out your order (that does make ordering much quicker, which I like) but the way they use fresh ingredients and compact it into a hot, toasty hunk of bread. 

The sandwich bags are categorized by meat, and it's super easy to customize with your red Sharpie.  Just circle or fill in the bubble of what toppings, condiments, seasonings, etc. you want. They even offer up a bean patty for veggies, which is very good. 

Subway's toasted sandwiches always end up cold after awhile because of the veggies.  

Jimmy Johns is fresh and yummy too, but has only a fraction of the meats and toppings...plus isn't toasted. 

Quizno's I think is too expensive for what it is. 

Firehouse is good, but again, I don't remember my few times there if there was a toasty crunchy bread option. 

My only suggestion is offering a smaller half-sized sub.  After half a regular sized one, I'm usually packed because they're so dense!"}
{"text":"Our favorite sandwich spot ! Such an amazing concept ! Brown bag it ! Pick your selection of meat or vegetarian and add all your favorites ! Very consistent ! Always yummilicious !!!!"}
{"text":"I am new to the neighborhood, so I've been trying all the local restaurants.  This one didn't disappoint. I was looking for a quick bite and a decent sandwich.  

Service was good, but it was a bit slow because I went at the noon rush hour. The ordering system, as someone else commented, is unique.  It was a little confusing at first, but I think it did a good job of getting customers processed and out of the way. They actually take the orders faster than they can fill them, so I was waiting with 5-10 other people in the back of this small restaurant. Other than the wait, which was probably about 10 minutes, I have nothing bad to say. 

I had a turkey sandwich that was pretty good, worth stopping for again. I'll definitely be returning, maybe just a little later after the rush hour."}
{"text":"Everything was really good, except for a $40.00 tray of salad. It was basically lettuce with a few \"greek salad\" toppings on the top. Maybe worth $30.00. Sandwiches were very good. Ten times better than Subw@y."}
{"text":"They've really improved on all facets of the operations. Always like the food and now the place is much cleaner and well stocked. Staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great place to eat will definitely be back. The place is clean and the staff is frendly"}
{"text":"A little pricy for a sandwich, but I can get by that because you get to customize what you want. The staff is nice and seems to appreciate your business. The bathrooms are clean, but the thing I can't seems to get by is dirty tables. All of them are always dirty and I have been here at three different times a day. Otherwise though great food!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by here today for the first time, 10/10!! I usually go to silver mines but on the way there I decided to try this joint instead since it was new. Customer service is ON POINT, the two guys (white, manager I think? And black guy) helped me out and they were very nice. I love putting all sorts of condiments on my Sandwich and they put exactly the appropriate amount and it tastes fantastic! The only downside is really the price (14\" for $11) is really harsh for a college student especially when subway is $5 for 12\" (but subway is incredibly inferior compared to these guys). Worth it, will come back here again."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich shop with several options.  Is it gourmet, no but its a fast, quality option that would easily win over subway and compete with potbelly."}
{"text":"I had the \"muffuletta\"-it was ok, but certainly not at all authentic (no mortadella, wrong bread, weak olive dressing). The bread is the biggest disappointment, and of course, for a sandwich shop, that's HUGE.
I think the concept is very solid-people want choices, and the number of possible combinations here are virtually endless.
The quality of the meat is certainly a step up from Milio's, Cousin's etc.
I thought the prices were spot on. They had about five employees on duty when I was there-how they show a profit with that many employees is a mystery to me.
I gave them an extra star because they were very fast & very friendly"}
{"text":"I didn't get a chance to eat there, my review is based entirely on their ordering system/service...

As I walked in I noticed that there was one table with food and 8-10 tables holding tickets looking at the kitchen.  In front of me a bunch of people bottle necked in line - trying to figure out the order form.

No way I'm waiting for this, only an hour for lunch..."}
{"text":"I'm so feeling this sandwich shop!! Every time has been spot on! I must say, this which wich location beats all the other shops hands down. This is my spot!"}
{"text":"We were tired of Subway and decided to give this place a try.  Boy, am I glad we did.  It was great!  I got the Shrimp Po Boy and it was awesome!  They even gave us a free treat for our kids after they ate. I love this place because there are so many options that you won't find in other sandwich shops. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because it is kind of expensive for a sandwich- we paid $20 for 2 adults and two 2 yr olds after a coupon for one meal free."}
{"text":"They have the best mobile app around and it is my favorite fast food sandwhich. Sure the ingredients aren't always the freshest tasting but you don't go to mcdonalds to have some beef still mooing. It's a fast food sandwhich that tastes great with an enormous amount of customizations. They have more vegetable and sauce choices than any other sandwhich place I've been in."}
{"text":"You step in the door and you're greeted with a warm welcome every time. Great personalities & the sandwiches are made with care as are they beyond delicious. Just had a Tuna wich made how I could not have had the time to do at home! Loved it! And love this location!"}
{"text":"let me do you all a favor, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY AT THIS LOCATION. I love which which... this location is absolutely terrible. The manager is rude and clueless. the staff is completely incompetent. I am a long time customer and within the last year (I kid you not) EVERY TIME I have come here they have messed up mine and everyone I knows food.  My last visit, both of our sandwiches were wrong so I called in  to notify the manager because after the 5th or 6th time, I was over it. the manager was \"oh so sorry\", promised she would \"personally\" remake our food and refund our meals. she did NOT remake our sandwiches, instead she yelled at the staff and disappeared off into the back. we waited close to 15min to get our refund.. after one of sandwiches \"mysteriously\" disappeared off the register history.

after an hour ordeal, I have now come home to a long awaited lunch only  to find my sandwich is wrong.. again.  

please go to any other location."}
{"text":"This small place features fresh, tasty, large sandwiches, very clean surroundings, and a nice friendly staff. A first time visit and a fine surprise...we'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Which Wich since they opened at Westgate in Glendale. I found one in La Porte Texas on a business trip, so i have some idea of what to expect.
The new store on Bell road is by far the best staffed which equals fast service. 

I am working on trying all of the sandwiches, Elvis is the next on my list"}
{"text":"The shop was clean, and the people were friendly. My co worker and I submitted our order via internet, which is super handy. The low rating is due to my sub. I got an artichoke sandwich and it was awful. So awful that I threw it out. I will go back but will stick with chicken or whatever."}
{"text":"Had the special of the month \"shrimp Po boy\" it was pretty good the shrimp was hot the bread was toasty and had a nice kick. Came with a bag of \"voodoo\" chip's wich were interesting like a cross between salt and vinegar and bbq. Service was kind of slow and the seating was kind of spartan. Will go back if the mood arises but not going to go out of my way ."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places to eat on mill for lunch. However after waiting for 12 minutes for a medium grinder while the only customer in shop due to training a new employee, I wont be returning. Im all about better training for better customer service however when you take 12 min of my 15 min break why would i return? After I made it known I was unhappy they began yelling have a nice day repeatedly. To finish off the experience  they didn't put half the veggies on the sub. Lost my business wich wich."}
{"text":"This place is really good and you can completely customize your sandwich!!! Just don't try the house chips if you aren't into heavy peppery seasoning...you don't really get very many either... I love getting to keep the cups though!! Double punches on Tuesday so don't forget your punch card!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is good! The location is kinda tough to find parking unless you don't mind walking through a parking garage and down a sidewalk. The associates are all very friendly and take the bags seriously, if you ask for extra mayo or ranch they really give it to you."}
{"text":"Which Wich delivers on an interesting and interactive-by-not-being-interactive premise: they leave it up to you to make your sandwich. Okay, not really, so let me explain. You walk in, and you're greeted by rows of paper bags. Each paper bag is specific to either a meat (chicken, ham, turkey, etc.) or a style of sandwich (Classic, Italian, Comfort, etc.). Once you decide what kind of sandwich style you want, you choose the bag, and on the bag, you mark off what you want on your sandwich, i.e., what kind of toppings, dressings, bread, etc. Then you hand your order off to the cashier, they ring you up, and you've got yourself a delicious sandwich in a matter of minutes. No assembly line sandwich making like you find at...what's that place called...you know...

If you get intimidated or confused, not to worry; a friendly staff member will be there to assist you in your sandwich-building process.

Yes, it's a fine concept, but the sandwiches are better. With three sizes to choose from, and a breadless sandwich for us healthier-conscious types, Which Wich is definitely one of the better sandwich shops in town. Their deli meats and vegetables are always fresh, and the concept's a winning one. Definitely my choice when it comes to sandwiches."}
{"text":"pretty cool how you can pick and choose what you want, only downside is my mind gets goin with all the options and the sandwich can come out wierd. no option to tell them light on lettuce or easy on the mustard. (you ask for mustard you get alot of mustard!) My wife loves this place. she usually gets a vegi sandwich (not my gig but tasted good). im no pro but kinda tastes saltier than most sandwich place. 

service is pretty slow too.

I would go back!"}
{"text":"Great Sandwhich, but slow service. Took about 15 minutes to get my order. Quicker service would make it 5 stars in my opinion."}
{"text":"When I first saw the name \"Which Which\" I was very excited ! I thought to myself, \"Yes ! A new restaurant added to River Gate!\" So I had to try them out. 

When I first walked in the restaurant there was a man at the door and he politely had the door opened. He greeted us and asked us was this out first time, then after he explained how the ordering process worked we were ready to pay. 

Everything was going well until I took my bag to the cashier. I received terrible customer service. The young man, Connor, was very rude. I asked what \"feta\" was and he kept saying \"what, what ?!\" Apparently I was pronouncing it incorrect. One of his co-workers had to answer my question. The young man did not look happy, nor did he ask me anything but \"are you getting a drink\". He didn't even tell me my total ! 

I felt very unhappy, because this was my first time at this location & I felt very un-welcomed by Connor. If the young man doesn't have good customer service skills then he should not be put on the register where he has to interact with customers. 

I spent $17.75 for two people and received horrible customer service that made me never want to go back to this location. 

The gyros were okay, the fries could've been cooked a little longer. I do thank the young African-American man at the door who helped me out."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I try not to go more than once a week but sometimes I can't help myself.

Good deal on the sandwiches (they're all $5.25).  Extra meat is $1 extra, double meat is $2 extra.

Countless possibilities to make the sandwich exactly what you want.  

My favorites:
- Cuban (ham/pork/swiss/pickles/mustard/extra meat)
- Black bean (add pepper jack/lettuce/salt/pepper/spicy mayo/extra meat)

And they have the best ice around.  I know that sounds funny, you'll just have to try it for yourself.

Only thing I don't like is that ugly Tar Heel they have up."}
{"text":"Really a special place for sandwiches, just the variety that they offer and your ability to customize to your heart's content makes coming here a pleasure.  Also (changes every month I believe) they have a sandwich special that's often quite interesting.  The kids really love filling out their order bags."}
{"text":"I can't even say how much I love which wich. Made to order, easy, fun, fast, fresh, hot  I could eat every meal here, if I wouldn't go broke. Only $7 for a 7 in."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, and I've got to say...I really love this place. The bread is fresh, with a great texture to it, the meat is tasty, and the amount of options you are given is awesome! 

The only thing I would recommend is rearranging the seating. When you are squished into the table because the person at the table behind you decides they want to recline, it's not comfortable!"}
{"text":"First time in a which witch and I was presently surprised! Efficient and interesting set up with reasonable prices. 
This chain had the banh mi as a special and it was way better than I expected it to be. I usually get mine from legitimate Vietnamese stores and I was expecting this one to be a huge let down, especially since it's a white-ish chain (racist? Maybe? Sorry. Not sure. Maybe if I have to ask it is.) yes the sandwich is a little different than the original and it's missing the pâté, but seriously, a solid variation. Definitely would come again"}
{"text":"I have been to which which a few times but I brought my wife for the first time and this is now her favorite sandwich place. We have gone back 3 more time because she likes it so much. There sandwiches are great and the staff is awesome. My wife loves ordering a sandwich \"skinny\" style. That's where they pull out the center inside of some of the bread. I always order the turkey bacon ranch toasted and it's amazing."}
{"text":"Great size portions...I always get the lettuce wraps. Been here prob about 5 times. Great brownies for $1.25! Love their monthly/seasonal sandwich selections."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food. Way better than those ala carte sub places. Come here once a month and never had a bad sandwich!"}
{"text":"I have given this location several opportunities to win me over because my daughter loves their food....but the service is horrible.  3 times in a row they incorrectly made at least 1 sandwich.  To top it off it has to be the slowest service in town.  If you are the only one in the place you will be lucky to have your food in 10 minutes.  Don't waste your time.  There are plenty of better choices nearby."}
{"text":"I'm usually pretty optimistic about restaurants. This place was \"bleh.\" The employees weren't very attentive and forgot parts of my order. The atmosphere was fine, as expected. The ordering process was interesting.

Onto the food. I ordered a Philly cheesesteak, which is supposedly one of their specialties. It was pretty bland. It was basically just meat with undercooked green peppers and onions. The meat itself wasn't seasoned or anything, just tasted like plain beef. It was edible but, I've had much better cheesesteaks for much cheaper.

Overall, for the price, it's not really a great value. I'd rather go to a Potbelly or a Subway even."}
{"text":"Love the food, but am VERY disappointed that I was charged 1.50 for a refill, when every other time I have been to Which Wich, it was only .50  I don't understand how they can get away with charging different prices.  It seems to me that the price should be the same nationwide...and I have been to several different locations nationwide...all only charged .50 !  This will definitely affect my decision about how often to come here."}
{"text":"I loved Which Which when I lived in LA but this one is a joke. I've ordered from here several times on Grubhub and literally every single time, something has been wrong or missing. I thought I'd give them one last chance today, and lo and behold, they failed to send the chips I ordered. EXCEPT THEY DIDN'T! I wish I were making this up, but the chips were INSIDE the wrap. As in, someone had opened a bag of chips and mixed them in with the rest of the ingredients in the wrap. Is this real life? What kind of buffoons do they have working there?? It was absolutely disgusting. So this was my last time with Which Which, or at least this location."}
{"text":"Not impressed or pleased at all, placed an order for the steak and cheese..
No flavor...no steak
It basically lame roast beef.. Dry
Cold
Asked for a toasted sub and it was not.
Not going back again."}
{"text":"If I could give this no stars I would. First of all when you pull up the place, it looks closed because they have dark blinds rolled down. Which is understandable when the sun goes down but roll them back up to let customers know your open. Second, the place was dead with no customers and it took 20 minutes to make two sandwiches. Third my sandwich was not only made wrong but was all bread no meat. Lastly, it was not clean! There were other tables with food on them and where they make the sandwiches was not clean. This will be the last time I ever go to this place."}
{"text":"Subpar sandwiches? Nah, they're not even that good. Considering how many sandwich places are on Mill and they're all better, this place isn't going to last.

Also asked about their vegan options... lets just say that the cashiers don't know what they're talking about, and that they need to train them better."}
{"text":"Very accommodating & friendly. We had an amazing bowlwich, \"wich\" was amazing!! Makes us want to try a sandwich next time...."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this Which Wich location. Please explain how you guys run out of ice cream before 3? You guys should have big amounts of ice cream for a shake and you don't. Do you guys know how to get food from the suppliers? My father has gone to many Which Wichs and they all have better service and they have things in check. This location doesn't know when they run out of things and they don't know that people that use older Which Wich cups can't use the lids because the lids are to big. Can you believe that? Lids that don't fit. Y'all need to get in check cause this place is disappointing me even more everytime I come. Thank you"}
{"text":"Best sandwich. In a week I ate at Quiznos, Subway, Jimmy John's and Which Wich. I got the Italian ever time. Which Wich was by far the absolute best. For now on I will only get Which Wich. The flavors are amazing and really high quality. They have options you can get anywhere else. Only negative is they are on the upper end on price but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"A Slithery Mess.  That's what I got when I ordered a chicken sandwich.  There was nothing in the chicken salad except chicken and mayonaise and more mayo.  Unfortunately, I asked for may to be spread on the bread, but they plopped pints of it.  It was not tasty.  The chicken salad wasn't appetizing at all.  The chocolate shake was great though.  It's the next morning and I'm still feeling queezy thinking about that sandwich."}
{"text":"I think I might have tried all the sandwich offerings here and they all are much better than what you can get in Subway. And so many vegan options!! The toppings and dressings are nice but sometimes they don't do a good job in \"assembling\" the sandwich (if that sounds right). Overall, service is fast, but they do a lot of mistakes in the order."}
{"text":"A little pricey for my lunching tastes, but the thanksgiving themed sandwich I had was very good. I couldn't find info on sandwich sizes, maybe I missed where it was listed and I ordered a large. Thankfully they made it wrong and realized it before they gave it to me, because it was huge! When they remade it I asked for a smaller size and they had no problem refunding me and charging me for the smaller size."}
{"text":"From MA and this is the first I've heard of it & I loved it! Got the turkey ham club. The avocado I added was good & fresh! Staff was also extremely friendly! will def be back to try another before I head home!"}
{"text":"I love all the unlimited toppings you care to our on your sub,  some creative choices include candied walnuts,  cranberries,  hummus,  French onions,  and house chips. 

You can also thin your which,  where the cut out some of the middle bread so there's less carbs. 

I have been really trying to bring myself to get the Elvis wich with bananas, peanut butter and bacon!

However, I think the novelty of the place draws me more than the actual sandwiches."}
{"text":"I decided to try this sandwich shop last night since I always drove past it and the reviews were ok. I walk in and wait 8 min in line with one person ahead of me. Then I finally placed my order for a turkey sandwich (I added a veggies and some light mayo) and  got a drink. My total was $10.22 for a sandwich and a drink. So, I took a seat and waited for about 10-15 to receive my sandwich. I got my sandwich and it was DROWNED in mayo , I was getting mayo everywhere by just unwrapped the sandwich. Then I got up to get some napkins and instead of napkins they have a lovely roll of brown paper towels sitting out for you to grab. Then I got up to get a utensil to scrape off the mayo and I had to use a straw because they don't set out any plastic utensils. When I first bit into my sandwich there was mayo gushing out and the turkey was paper thin and tasted like a gallon of salt was pored onto it. I had to scrap off a majority of my veggies because they were covered in mayo. I threw away my trash and left and no one said \"have a good night\" or \"thanks for coming\" or anything so the customer service was fantastic either."}
{"text":"Was my first time eating here. I thought it was pretty unique that you get a brown bag and order what kind of sandwich you want. Be sure to pay attention to what bag your grabbing each number is a different meat. When I came in it wasn't busy so the 5 minute wait for a sandwich was a little ridiculous. The sandwich was delicious but it wasn't worth the price. Be prepared to spend $10 for a 7in sandwich with a small drink and chips."}
{"text":"I tried this location again. I really like the concept, but the execution is so bad. 

There was no one ordering ahead of us and not too many people already seated when I got there early on a Sunday evening for four sandwiches to go. Given that I live less than 5 mins away, I went ahead and ordered the sandwiches hot. 

Rookie mistake. If WW had a system where all sandwiches were ready at/near the same time, I could have made it home with four hot sandwiches. Place order, wait 7/10 mins and first order is called. Several minutes later two sandwiches go to a previously sat table. Several minutes later two more of my sandwiches. Long wait, two items to people who ordered after me. Then my last sandwich. So, 10 or more mins after my first sandwich, we received our last one. Of course, sandwich one is pretty much cold by then. 

I don't understand how their system is customer friendly. Even if you eat in, who wants to sit and stare at their food for 10 minutes while the rest of the table waits?  I have seen this all three visits. 

Done with Which Wich unless maybe I'm alone, starving and it's the only place around."}
{"text":"Great sandwich and options! House chips are amazing as well (cracked pepper kettle chips). Will come again"}
{"text":"I absolutely hated the food here. I got food poisoning not once but TWICE! their shakes are amazing and I used to make mine a little bigger because they leave about an inch at the top. All of their ingredients are fresh but sometimes they let their dishes sit in a dirty sink/water which is a no-no. The manager was an asshole and the employees were sometimes druggies. Most were extremely great. The actual owners are as sweet as can be though. Their food is completely ehhh. They don't put enough bacon on their BLTs and their other sandwiches like the gyro is just plain awful. SO glad I decided to not work there anymore. The food making me and supposedly others was not a place I wanted to be working. Shakes YES, sandwiches NO! I always made sure that I kept the place extremely clean (Slight germ phobe) and I always made sure every customer knew how to work the bags and what was good on the menu and what wasn't. I haven't been back since so I'm not sure what its like now but the parking lot is always empty and I'm just waiting for it to close down."}
{"text":"I must say I hated this place the first couple of times I went here, but it has grown on me.  I really like their roast beef"}
{"text":"For a quick, in and out lunch I have been repeatedly impressed with this place. First, the ordering process is very simple and low stress. You start by selecting a bag for the item you'd like to offer. Each bag has a list of the toppings that you can check off. It's as simple as that. No going down the assembly line peeking over the glass trying to decide what you want while you hold up the line. Or worse yet, getting caught behind the indecisive customer that stares at the toppings for hours. At Which Wich, you hand them your order bag filled out, pay, and then wait. They are super quick too! 

The menu is huge but broken up into categories which makes it easier to decide on an item. I don't eat bread, so I order the lettucewich and it is amazing! They have a similar option at Jimmy John's, but the meat is always super skimpy, so I leave feeling not quite satisfied. At Which Wich, they give you plenty of meat and have so many options for toppings, I can barely finish one on my own. Sometimes the lettuce doesn't hold up to eat it like a sandwich, so I just ask for a bowl and eat it with a fork and knife. Still tastes the same, which is spectacular!"}
{"text":"It's always a very relaxing feeling when getting your food at this location.  I have been coming here since it opened and have never been disappointed.   Great food and service every time :)"}
{"text":"So...Yelpers get a bad rap because people complain about stuff when something isn't perfect, yet they didn't try to get the situation rectified.  Here's an example of a problem and a perfect and nearly immediate solution from a franchise!  Kudos!...


My initial experience with Which Wich wasn't exactly awesome.  I ordered 2 sandwiches online.  You are promised an email confirmation.  I didn't get one.  No worries, 'cause the order is under my name, and I know I'll have no problem picking it up on arrival.

Got to the shop, my sandwiches were ready!  Score!  Brought them back to the office and my co-worker's was perfect, just as ordered.  Mine?  I literally had nothing on it.  I ordered the tomato/avocado with a smattering of toppings and sauces.  I got bread with tomato and avocado.  Dry.  Sad.  And worst of all, no cheese!  Apparently the online ordering system has some kinks to be worked out. 

Annoyed and mostly hungry, I sent a belligerent email to Which Wich about my \"shitty sandwich\" experience. (Not proud, BTW).  Within 20 minutes, I received a phone call from Peter, the franchise owner apologizing for 1) not getting my email confirmation which would have alerted me to the ordering glitch, resulting in the incorrect order and 2) an offer to come back whenever and get my sandwich corrected, gratis.

Well, I went back the next day and ordered in person (not about to try the online thing again!). The staff was friendly, didn't make me feel like a cheapass for getting a free meal, and hey, my sandwich was perfect this time!

Thanks, Which Wich, Peter, and your awesome staff!

Bonus: sign up for their emails and get some decent special offers (not all crap like some fast food email lists)"}
{"text":"My second time here. I live almost across the street and I tend to forget that it's close by.  I agree with one of the reviewers who said the turkey is a bit salty. I did checked off salt and pepper for my options and but I requested - lightly salty. I'll opt out for salt next time since that may have been the problem. I love the concept and the atmosphere of the restaurant. I also wish the bread was a little softer. All in all I will continue to go back and I'm glad they are so close to where I live!!  Thanks Which Which!"}
{"text":"I love a good sandwich and have certainly been to my fair share of them in my day. I have heard about Which Which for a few years now so when I saw this one had opened we made plans to check it out for lunch today. I ordered the Roast Beef, my wife order the vegetarian, and my sons order the ham and cheese and the buffalo chicken Sandiwch. None of us were very impressed and my son quickly pointed out that the bacon on his sandwich was \"bacon bits\" instead of strips of bacon. Minus 1 star for inferior quality. Each of my kids ordered milk shakes and the 2nd one literally took 14 minutes to be made!  Outrageous in my opinion unless your churning ice cream for each shake people!!!  Minus 1 star for slow service. 

Now, as I'm waiting for the shakes to come up the kid calling out the sandwiches says \"French Dip for No name\". I chuckled because obviously the person filling out the bag didn't give a name. Well, the manager obviously didn't find it funny and scolded him for it launching a back and forth about the lack of training he was given. Minus 1 star for the manager and minus 1 more for arguing in front of customers. 

All in all it was not a good experience. Definitely wont be back and with all of the other choices in Grayhawk I suggest the owners get their act together or this location will close before the next milkshake gets made."}
{"text":"Which Wich is probably my favorite lunch spot. The sandwich components are all super fresh and tasty, and you can make it EXACTLY as you wish.  I get the same thing every time because I love it so much... tomato avocado, although there are a ton of other options.  They have a good selection of vegetarian sandwiches that are more than just a pile of lettuce on a piece of bread. Their cookies and house chips are awesome too! 

Which Wich gets busy during the lunch hour but the quality is worth the wait. Best sandwiches in town!"}
{"text":"Never get rid of the super food wich! It's so yummy and such a unique affordable sandwich shop option. Very clean location and the staff are constantly friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"A little confusing if you're headed there for the first time but once you understand the order process you get one delicious sandwich!"}
{"text":"We love Which Wich.  Sandwiches are just the right size and tasty.  One night we stopped to grab some dinner and met the owner.  He chatted with us for some time and was the nicest man."}
{"text":"I guess there was a long line at lunch on a Tuesday because lunch options in Sun Prairie are scarce. I paid $9 for a mediocre turkey club sandwich. It was tasteless and drowning in mayo. Gross."}
{"text":"There isn't too much to be said about a chain but ill do my best to make it as interesting and accurate as possible. Now as far as this location goes, its a great location for those who live in Sun Prairie. It is located right in the middle of the new intersection near their new movie theatre (which is fantastic by the way). Some simple seating, a counter, and a wall with bags to your left is what your greeted with. This location was pretty clean and the staff was pretty friendly as well. We had never been here before and a really nice employee came over and explained the whole shebang to us. Simple enough, grab a bag the size you want, choose the base of the sandwich (I got the cubano) and choose all the fixin's your little hear desires.

Here is where it sort of started going a little down hill. There were six of us which I know is a big order but it looked like they had a pretty organized line for the actual manufacturing of the sandwich. It took a lot longer for the sandwiches to be made than I thought. About 30 minutes for one or two of them. My sandwich was pretty poorly made with half of the ingredients falling out of it when I pulled it out of the now oily brown paper bag. The sandwich I asked for toasted and was warm on one side and the other was as if it came out of the fridge. Again it is a chain so my expectations weren't a gourmet melt or anything. They also doused a very strong mustard on the sandwich but only in one spot... Which was a nice shock to my taste buds.

I'll probably return to another Wich Wich some time, maybe not this one just because of where I live but it wasn't the worst place i've ever been."}
{"text":"Kids and I have been waiting to come here for awhile... because it looked interesting.  We ordered 4 sandwiches waiting 10+ minutes plus for our food with no one else in line.

Food- 

The bread brings no flavor to the sandwhich.  It's crusty but totally blah - literally flavorless... needs salt in the dough.  After what is a sandwich without the foundation of an excellent bread.

The Philly was a waste of time and Philly would be upset... tiny sandwich, lite on the cheese and flavor.  Blt was fair, but dry as a sponge.

Service-

We lingered here after a swim meet at the high school and several people wandered in and out, but as soon a they left the two persons crew would immediately spilt to the back room...  it's a ghost town in the place with zero supervision.

I like the concept of the place - grab a bag, grab a mark, circle your ingredients, pay... wait, eat.  Unfortunately, that intended simplicity is also what kills any semblance of customer service or personality."}
{"text":"I am really picky about subs, and this is in my top 3 places. I love just the standard turkey & swiss, and the best seasonal sandwich they have is by far the grilled Reuben..it's even better than Chompies. Also be sure to try the ice cream cookie sandwich. It's to die for! Fyi, this particular location is well managed, but I have been to other locations that are not so great."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes but it was nothing near what I expected I ordered through door dash and was super excited when I received my food I got a custom turkey sub with all my favorite fixings and my coworker got a cheese steak sub it was all...ok my avocado was messy and a little brown nothing special for 15 bucks I'll stick to subway"}
{"text":"Yuk is the only word I have for this sub chain.  I went here for the first time today and my sandwich was the most disgusting mess I've EVER had as a sub.  I had a \"simple\" ham sub, who could ruin that, right?  They did.  

First of all, the line was to the door, so they won't care about this review, but this review is about saving you some money and not spending it here.  My bread was stale.  I ordered mustard on my sandwich and it.was.coated. in mustard.  So much mustard was on it that it was all over the outside of the bread.  The hot pepper mix didn't taste like typical giardinara (sp?).  There were literally 2 pieces of ham that spanned my 7 inch sub.  I ended up throwing away half the sandwich because it was so bad.  My lunch total came to over $7.00 for a 7 inch sub and a rice krispy treat.  I'm sorry, but there are much better sub places than this in my opinion.  I would even take that place with $5 footlongs over this place, so that's saying a lot.  The only reason this gets 2 stars instead of one is that the employees were friendly."}
{"text":"The roast beef was better than a Subway, and I liked the bread, it's kind of different. The \"fresh vegetables\" were anything but. The sub was smaller than subway for more money. I did like how many people they had working and the production line way of making the sub made it move faster. Not my favorite place to get a sub."}
{"text":"Love this place! So so much better than subway (not that you can even compare the two!) I love the style of getting to make your sandwich exactly how you want it. There are so many options and a lot of variety. Love their unique options as well, it really makes this place stand out. They never disappoint!"}
{"text":"I frequent this Which Wich regularly.  The food is generally quite good and reliable.  Today a young man named Patrick came by our table to check on us.  I was missing an ingredient in my salad which Patrick promptly brought to me.  My friend's sand wich wasn't made to her specifications.  Patrick gave her a coupon for a complimentary one on her next visit.  This is truly good customer service."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday. I was pleasant surprised. The sandwiches are really good and I like the way to order."}
{"text":"Very good food is overpriced but good fast device clean filled me up but hurt my pocket."}
{"text":"I just paid $10.00 for a regular drink and a 7 inch chicken salad sandwhich. Are you kidding me? I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches !!!!
Amazing selection 
Awesome cookie 
Recommend this place guys"}
{"text":"Love Which wich! Fresh, fast with lots of delicious choices!  Staff really friendly and efficient! Clean with lots of seating."}
{"text":"Which wich is a unique way to order sandwiches! You pick the matching bag for the type of sandwich you want and check off what you want to add. I've been here a handful of times so far and have had a few different sandwiches including turkey and black bean patty (which was really good!) You can also get a lettuce wrap or salad option, if you don't want a sandwich. Someone said it's expensive, but portions are on the larger side, so it all evens out. I am new to the Solon area and will definitely be going back! The staff is friendly and the food is always fresh!"}
{"text":"So, I'm partial to locally owned deli's with good quality meats. This isn't locally owned but the quality is good. I like a muffuletta sandwich. This has the name but not quite a muffuletta. Jason's has a genuine muffuletta and it's amazing. The one here is not genuine... but it's a REALLY good sandwich. Their ordering through there app is really convenient and I like their rewards program, although it would be nice if it had smaller perks between the free sandwich gaps. In general this is a great, fast sandwich shop. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Place gets packed at lunch time. Not fancy but good and consistent. The concept to build your own sandwich works for me and the service is quick"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 sandwiches and a kids meal. The sandwiches I ordered were the meatball grinder and Italian Club. Meh. They were really salty. Like, really really salty. I had half of each and it made me so thirsty. I haven't been here in a bit so I can't remember if they normally are that salty. I probably won't get those again. 

The kids meal sides were weird looking. There were super green apples and dried out carrots. Those apples seriously looked butchered. Kiddo liked the juice and sandwich though. 

Not the worst sandwiches, definitely not the best either. 

Other positives? Nice workers and the ice is really small and I like that."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner last night as a first-timer.

Things I loved:
Friendly staff! - The guy working there was quick to ask if we knew how to order.
How you order - Customize your sandwich (lots to choose from) on a paper bag so you choose exactly what's on it.
Cleanliness - Tables and floor were clean... until we got there. Oops!
They had the World Series game on tv!

Things I wasn't so crazy about:
Sandwich quality - It was GOOD but not great
Price - For the price, I'd prefer something I think is GREAT, like Jersey Mike's (We paid $17 for 2 sandwiches and 1 drink)

They gave us a punch card with double punches, so for that reason, we will probably return. Otherwise, will probably stick to our usual sandwich spots"}
{"text":"When I first walked in, I thought it was confusing but then felt, what a great idea.  You pick a bag and mark all your choices on the bag with your name on it, how can this go wrong?   Well I got it to go so I didn't discover until I got home, that mine was not made to order and was hugely disappointed.  I ordered it \"wich\" style which comes with 1000 island and coleslaw, mine did not.  I think even if it was made as ordered, getting past the super thickness of close to stale tasting bread, it wouldn't be a good sandwich.  Three quarters of it is sitting right in front of me and I'm over it.  Maybe they have some kinks to work out as it's only been open for a couple of weeks but I doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"Awful. Slow service and the food was either tasteless or, in the case of the carrots and apples with the kids' meals, just plain bad. Skip this place."}
{"text":"This place is good but there isn't anything that makes me crave them.  It's your typical meat cheese bread place.  The menu can be a little deceiving, for instance they list pork loin as a protein on a sandwich which makes me think of thick slices of pork, but when you get it it looks like regular old lunch meat.  I also wish they had a few more options for toppings."}
{"text":"Good Sandwiches.  Easy to order and customize however you desire with their \"order bags\".  I had a Philly that was one of their R&D sandwiches and it was a solid Philly.  Beats the heck out of Subway!"}
{"text":"I like the concept and the many options. My kids think it's cool to fill out their own order. I can't help but think there had to be at least one employee who looked at this kids meal before it went out. Gross. We had a good laugh about it."}
{"text":"They have the WORST ordering system in the world. 

You have to place your order on a paper bag. Plan on an extra 5-10 minutes for everyone in your group who hasn't been here before. Then plan on an extra 15 minutes for the SIX people on the sandwich assembly line read your bag and make a sandwich...which will be wrong.

I wrote my order down on the paper bag. The 7 people working there today all read the same bag and still got the sandwich wrong. When I came back to get the bacon they forgot, they took it behind the counter and piled bacon bits on it. I asked if they were out of bacon, but that is their bacon. ....old, crusty, processed bacon bits. 

Their sandwiches are nothing special, they are over-priced, and they apparently don't want to talk to their customers, so they make you fill in bubbles on a paper bag to place an order.

I will avoid this shit-hole at all costs."}
{"text":"The sandwiches  took awhile to come out but were great! Good variety of sandwiches. Cool vibe inside. It was fun ordering our sandwiches and checking off options on the bags. Ordering on the bags allowed for more customization! Will be going back."}
{"text":"This is a great little sub/sandwich shop.
The employees are friendly and efficient.
The interior has been really spotless every time I've stopped by.

The ordering can be confusing the first time but you'll get a hang of it.

This last time I ordered their limited time offer - Banh Mi.
It was awesome!
Banh Mi is a Vietnamese type of sandwich with pork.
Love that I was able to get a sandwich like this at a regular sandwich shop.

The ice machine also has the little tiny ice that I love!

Great place for to pick-up or eat-in for lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent! Fun way to design a sandwich!"}
{"text":"I work in this area every Friday, and every Friday I go to Paradise Bakery or the new Wildflower location for a salad. I decided to try Which Wich to break out of my routine.

I shouldn't have.

It wasn't the unique way to order your sandwich (on a preprinted paper bag), it wasn't the 15 minute wait to get my sandwich, it wasn't the employees...it was the sandwich.

Now, let me say, the bread that my sandwich was on was excellent! It was soft and chewy and crusty...GREAT bread! And the quality of the meat (I had turkey) was phenomenal! But...I needed my glasses to actually FIND the meat! Literally had to go searching for it. I also ordered avocado (for an extra charge) on my sandwich, and it was a spread, not slices. The caramelized onions I had added were tough and unpleasant as well, and the 'spicy' mayo was absent. I was more than a little disappointed.

I paid $10.18 for a 7 inch sandwich, chips and a drink. I usually pay a little under $10.00 for my salad from Paradise or Wildflower, and I take half home. I was expecting so much more from Which Wich, and received so much less.

I'll stick to my usual lunch spots."}
{"text":"I work in the same shopping center and was excited for something new to open. It is so good!! I normally hate toasted subs but when thwy recommended it i thought ok ill try it. Good thing because it was amazing. The staff is super friendly and helpful and the place is always clean. 
Keep it up guys! Ive been here 4 times already!!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches for fast food. Sandwiches you won't find anywhere else. My kids love this place."}
{"text":"Ordered the Banh Mi sandwich and the only way to describe it was Absolutely EPIC!! One of the best sandwiches I've ever had and would strongly recommend to anyone. 

Thank you for an amazing meal."}
{"text":"I ordered an egg salad sandwich ... got it, and barely had any egg salad on the bread.  The place was a pig sty ...dirty floors, trash on floors,not swept, tables dirty.  Employee was belching loud."}
{"text":"I have been to Which Wich plenty of times, it is in my top 5 of sandwich shops.  They have awesome flavor to their subs.  My favorite is their buffalo chicken! They have so many different choices.

The shop is unique in how you order, but I love it.  You pick a bag, mark what you want on your sandwich and they make it.  They call your name when it is ready.

The only con: it can get busy fast, so the tables are taken and there is not much standing room without thinking you are in the way.  Grab a table quick!

Also get the club card, you get a free sandwich after buying so many.

I hope they open one on the south side soon!"}
{"text":"I love Which Wich!  I have written a review on the one located in the park road shopping center.  When I saw the sign go up for Which Wich coming to Rivergate, I was so excited that I could have them more often!  We went to WW yesterday for lunch and they were busy, I believe the second or third weekend to be open.  While all of the WW we have been to are small and cramped, this one seems to have a little more space and more outside seating which is a plus.

I love their process of ordering.  It may seem overwhelming if you have not been, but you pick a bag based on the meat or specialty sandwich you want.   Once you select the bag you mark everything you want, put your name on the bag, and hand it to the cashier.  They will then call you up to get your sandwich in your bag.

Yesterday I got my favorite, the buffalo chicken and Kevin got the gyro.  Both were great.  I love how they have plenty of options compared to the standard sub shop.  Also, their shakes are good - have had the Oreo shake before.

Two Complaints:
They seemed over staffed, which is good for the sandwich making crew, but they had 4 people on the floor to help out those coming in with questions and to check on people eating.  I really did not need to be checked on 4+ times while having a Wich.  I think once the newness dies down, they can have the proper number working.  
They have a loyalty card for getting so many wiches and then you get one free at all of the other locations.  We finished one last time at another location, but they did not have any out at this location to start a new one."}
{"text":"My go to is the turkeywich. It has thousand island and coleslaw on it!! Tastes great and the price is right. Good perks program, too."}
{"text":"First time stopped by as I was looking for food close to my doctor's appt.  See that reviews by others are good.  It's like subway sandwich but there  option of sandwich or salad...  For about $5.00 for a sandwich that's acceptable.  Quality is good.  I will come back again."}
{"text":"My hubby loves sandwiches. I've never been a huge fan I mean I can make them at home for cheaper. They aren't that hard lol. That being said we ate her I got the Greek sandwich and it was amazing!! I loved it!! I want to try all the exotic taste they have.  Service was great and they were super friendly. I live we have a new couple restraunt."}
{"text":"Glad it is finally open! Had eaten at the one on Coronado last summer and enjoyed. Went this weekend and wasn't disappointed. Kids love filling out their own bag and waiting for their name to be called. Hope it stays. Haven't seen any advertising that it had opened and it doesn't have visibility from Bell Rd so you have to know where it is or stumble upon it."}
{"text":"Best QSR Sandwich Shop with Vegan Options in the Madison Area

Which Wich has quickly become our favorite spot for a quick lunch. They have many options, but what sets them apart, is the vegan sandwich. I have been there probably five times and look forward to the Tomato & Avocado + Hummus. They have an option called skinny where they get rid of the bread filler and I love all of the options like caramelized onions, mushrooms, crushed red pepper and the concept of filling out your order on a paper bag is fun. 

My only suggestion would be they should open up a location on the East side or downtown, so I could go more often!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad about their recent changes. This place has been a family favorite of ours for a year or so now. We've introduced so many people to Which Wich and talked it up to so many people. But much to our disappoint, they changed their menu and got rid of all of our favorites. We loves this place because it WASN'T like all the other sub shops, but now it's just like Subway, Jersey Mikes, Jimmy Johns. This will be most likely our last visit here for ourselves. Future visits will be for kids meals only. You were good while you lasted"}
{"text":"Make sure you have some free time.  

Ive been to the chandler location twice now once when it opened and now.  On both occasions it was moderately busy around 5-10 people and every time its taken a minimum of 30 minutes to get a cold sub.  

On the first occasion their registers went down but I chalked that up to them being new.  The owners were there and very polite about it.  This time they ran out of ingredients.  After 20 minutes had passed with my bag sitting there all alone the sandwich finally arrived it would have been nice for them to let me know rather than waste my time.  I was the only one left in the restaurant waiting soit wasn't hard to spot me.

The food was good they have interesting combinations and a ton of ingredients to choose from.  It is a little more expensive than most sandwich shops but if there is an ingredient you just have to have the price is worth it.  

Overall it is a decent sandwich shop with a good selection.  Just make sure you have half an hour to burn"}
{"text":"These are really good subs. I have been here twice now and both sandwiches were great.
When you walk in you see the big menu board on the left underneath that are a bunch of holders with brown sandwich bags in them. The holders are numbered to the sandwiches on the menu. So you pick your sandwich then you grab the bag with that number. On the bag are all the different options for the sandwich. You pick your bread, cheese and all the different toppings. Have it how ever you want. Also a fun tip, draw something on the back of the bag and you can see your bag go through the line.
Once you have everything filled out take your bag up to the counter and turn it in. Once you pay they hang your bag up on a line and send it on down. This is where having something drawn on the back comes in. Then you can easily see you bag make it's way down the line otherwise it just looks like every other bag. You don't have to but it is kind of fun. One thing you do want to do and don't forget is to write your name on the bag because once it gets down to the end of the line they put your sandwich in the bag and call out your name.
The staff is friendly and it does not take too long to get your sandwich. Also another tip, if you buy a large drink you can bring the cup back for cheap refills.
Like I said the sandwiches are very good. Fresh toppings and you can have it however you want. It also goes faster because they don't have to ask you about each item it is all written on the bag. I will definitely be back often. Although it will have to be a weekend treat because it is just a little too far away from my work to go here for lunch during the week.
This goes on the list as one of my new favorite sandwich places."}
{"text":"I went for my first time the other day. I would give it five stars except that it seems a bit overpriced for a sub place. The smallest sub on bread is 7 inches and it's nearly 8 dollars, and that's not including a side and a drink. Other than that...

I am a fan and will be back. I got the black bean patty and it was delicious. As soon as I walked in, someone showed me how they work (I was expecting a normal sub shop). Their ordering style is unique and in my opinion, the best. I wish other places would do it this way. I am usually indecisive when faced with a  menu full of items and often will rush my order just because I've felt stupid for staring at a menu while the cashier or sub-makers have a nearly impatient look on their faces that say \"come on, hurry up, stupid!\"
Here, I don't have to worry about that because you just pick what you want, including all ingredients, and then go to the counter. Take all the time you need. It's easy. There wasn't a long line waiting on me, but if there was, I would scoot over and make room for them to make their order and get to the counter before me if they finished first. No big deal. 

They have quite a selection and I found my black bean patty sub to be wonderful. I like how veggie friendly they are for us vegetarians. It's rare to see that here on the outskirts of Charlotte. 
My step daughter got a bowl (sandwich ingredients in a bowl - no bread), and it also looked delicious. 
The jalapenos seemed way more spicy here than at other places, to me. I just won't have them next time."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. It's like a much better version of subway, quizznos, etc. I thought it was going to be  alittle more homemade, but it was good."}
{"text":"Absolutely love picking what I want on the bag. And sandwiches are delicious!!! And plenty of vegetarian!! will be coming back"}
{"text":"Yo, so I went there for lunch right? That's by far the most important and my personal favorite meal of the day. It's the best time scientifically to ingest carbs and calories so you best believe a sandwich shop is the place to go! Okay so the staff was extremely rude cause I couldn't figure out that darn bagging thing they got. It's like, always confusing no matter how many times I go in ya know? Any who, I'm pretty sure the person working called me a retardd under her breathe. That's pretty rude. Also, they have vegan options and I personally hate vegans and crosshitters.. So until that place becomes somewhere else I'm definitely not going back. Peace! *mic drop*"}
{"text":"Great place for a sandwich!

Stopped in for lunch. They were busy, but took our order promptly. The cashier was pleasant and let us know there was a little bit of a wait. 

I had a lettuce wrap with chicken. My friend ordered the Monti Cristo. Both were very good. Very fresh! The lettuce wrap was full of tender chicken and crisp veggies! Delicious!

They offer lots of options! Looking forward to trying other things!"}
{"text":"OK sandwiches, nothing special. The price point is too high for this fast food restaurant. The staff is young and maybe lacks experience."}
{"text":"Which place to go eat? Which Wich!

Which meat do you want?
Which toppings?
Which sides?
Which bread?
Which condiments?

All those questions apply when ordering at Which Wich. Small restaurant with an order area and pick up area. You start out by going to the wall of bags and choosing your sandwich. Literally...50+ sandwiches offered all for $5.25 (no side/drink). On my recent visit I went with the beefsteak and added as many toppings as I thought were necessary and good. Keep in mind, any fault here is most likely on you for building such a sandwich.

Mine was good, and I made it as \"philly\" as I could. I did an OK job, but the flavor was good. Also ordered the \"hot cookie\", which was a nice finish. You've got to check it out. Good place to stop for a quick bite to eat before a movie at Park Terrace across the street."}
{"text":"They claim to have a superior sandwich but when you have 100 options, that's just not possible. It's exactly what you might expect from a sub chain, except it's more expensive. Lastly, I ordered bacon on my sandwich and did not get any, so that made my decision to not return pretty easy."}
{"text":"Which Wich as a company receives four stars in my book. Of the available sandwich shop options, Which Wich remains at the top of my list. The food seems fresh and is always tasty. The service is generally favorable as well.

This particular location, however, only wins the fourth star because of its name. Honestly, while the service is always friendly, it's also always extremely slow. Whether you're ordering in or ordering out, expect to wait a while.

The reason I have decided to rate this a four despite the slow service is because I've learned to expect it, and keep coming back anyway. The hot subs are really good. The cold subs are fresh and the ingredients don't taste days old.

The Oreo milkshake remains at the top of my list for best Oreo milkshake to date. (And I've tried a lot!) It does take a while to make, but in my opinion, the food is well worth the couple extra minutes of sitting around.

The prices are fair. Though somewhat high, I believe them to be justified by the portion sizes. I never walk away hungry. If you haven't been to Which Wich and you're into sandwiches, I'd recommend it. Find a location near you, and enjoy!  :)"}
{"text":"Just had a great sandwich at Which Wich.  It has an interesting new concept of ordering your sandwich.  You decide on which sandwich you want, find the corresponding brown bag, note what you would like on it and bring to the cashier.  

I had \"the Italian\" and thought it was great.  Plus, the restaurant was immaculate."}
{"text":"I  have only visited once so far. 

It is a very unusual manner to order.  But this is what makes this place the most interesting. 

I had the Turkey Ruben. I was a little disappointed that it lacked the zing that I usually get on a Ruben.  Also, mustard I ordered took something away. 

It is a nice change to the ordinary sandwich locations.  I probably would drift to another similar location first, but this is not a bad option if you are in the area."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I'm glad I only had to pay for the drink. 

The kids meals were fine and I liked the plastic box they put them in. 

I ordered a small club and it was made rather odd. It seemed as though the toppings were only put on one half of the sandwich. One side had turkey, ham, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and avocado. No bacon, bell pepper, olive or pickle. The other half seemed it have it all. Lots of olives, bell pepper, pickle ect. Having it all on one side made it very hard to eat and it was quite messy. I'm not sure how or why it was made that way. Like I said glad I had an offer that just had me pay for the drink."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get a delicious sub! 
At first the way you order may seem confusing but it's really great - you pick a bag according to the type of sandwich you want and then check off everything you want your sandwich to be (hot or cold, size, toppings) so there is no confusion.  You hand it to the person working the register then they make your sandwich.  The bread is fresh and the choice of toppings is very extensive (I personally love spinach and avocado on my sandwich).  Whenever I've been there the employees were very friendly and the place was clean.  Quick and delicious!"}
{"text":"I was a big fan when this place opened. I would say that then they did have superior sandwiches. But as the years went by, and the pictures of sandwiches on their walls had more and more meat, the meat and extras on my actual sandwiches were decreasing.  Today we got a small and medium sandwich, and two regular drinks and it came to almost $22.  Really NOT worth it.  If I wanted to pay that much, I would go to Firehouse Subs which gives you MUCH more meat. Which Wich has sunk to just about the level of Subway.  

Ordered a Seafood salad today and the sandwich was heated. I'm not sure why when it never was before and there wasn't an option for that. We also had a Buffalo Chicken which used sliced deli chicken and barely had any sauce.  

With so many sub places springing up, this used to be one of my favorites, but the years haven't been kind to it. I probably won't be returning unless they have one of their two for one offers, which I haven't seen in a long time now.  

In a crowded sandwich market, I just don't see the value/quality at Which Wich anymore that would make me want to go there."}
{"text":"I've previously rated this restaurant higher, but in the last year it has suffered. Today I think was the last straw. I ordered a Gyro which had no price on the menu. It turned out to be $8.95  It was just a small pita, meat, tomatoes and sauce and that was it. Are they kidding? They got my wife's order wrong. Tables were dirty. I think its better days are over. If you want a Gyro, the place near Carls Jr. in Scottsdale on Hyden is SO much better. And cheaper. I will get my free one at Which Wich and I think that will be it. Moving on."}
{"text":"What a different concept to a Sandwich shop!
Same steps as other places but you just fill out the bag of what you want!
So many choices awesome!
Fresh and timely. Staff was very friendly and helpful.
Will be back because have way more sandwiches to eat!"}
{"text":"Great concept and plentiful choices.  As a vegan I appreciate the vegan options when making my selections.  I ordered a veggie sandwich that met my dietary needs.    
I was nearly finished with my sandwich when I  found several pieces of bacon in it.  I told the woman behind the counter who said they must have flipped some pieces in by mistake when assembling it.  She did not offer me any type of compensation nor did she apologize.  
It made a poor first impression."}
{"text":"A fairly decent choice for lunch when on Mill Ave! When you go in, there are quite a few bags that you can choose from for your main ingredient (turkey, roast beef, chicken, etc) and then you can select as many or as few toppings as you'd like. It gets really busy at lunch time so you'll probably find yourself waiting for quite a while, unless you order ahead online.

The only thing I've noticed is the inconsistency of their sandwiches - sometimes I'll get a huge sandwich because whoever made it was very generous with the toppings I have chose & other times, I'll get a much smaller sandwich because there are barely any toppings. At times, the ingredients seem really fresh and other times they don't (specifically the lettuce so I've now stopped getting that & get spinach instead).

I'd say that even so, the sandwiches are fairly priced. If you check in on Yelp, you'll get a free bag of chips. They recently changed their rewards so there's no longer a punch card but rather, you get points depending on the menu item. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"After you've read all the employees friends dumb reviews, believe me when I say this place is a total rip off!  $7.50 for a sample sized sandwich!  Way less filling than a 6\" sub at Subway.  The food is not that good.  The Philly Cheese steak was bland and boring; barely any cheese.  This place is horrible."}
{"text":"I tried Which Wich for the first time today, after noticing it's new existence in my neck of the woods by my office. The ordering was interesting, and being a first-timer I probably had numerous bewildered looks on my face. So many bags. So many options. So many red Sharpies. After you go, you'll know what I mean.

I chose a buffalo chicken toasted sub with some provolone and a host of veggies. Wheat bread, because obviously I'm on a diet. The end product came out with well proportioned flavor, temperature, and a perfect meat to bread to veggie ratio. And yes, that's an important calculation for a self proclaimed superior sandwich. And my foodie friends said \"amen.\"

My buddy's sandwich was made incorrectly, but before it was given to him they realized the mistake. A woman came over to our table and introduced herself as the owner/manager and apologized for the inconvenience. Then a few minutes later when the sandwich was ready she personally delivered it with a free milkshake coupon. What a nice touch! My flustered friend was instantly appeased. He used the coupon on our way out, and after sampling it myself I can now say the Oreo milkshake is also delicious! Moments later my friend was found sleeping under a bridge in a full fledged food coma due to rapid inhalation of a 10.5\" sub, chips, AND a milkshake. Tragic."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to Which Wich for a quick lunch experience, even though it's not consistently that.

I like that you can go in & mark your order on a paper bag, making it somewhat quicker than other sandwich establishments where they ask you whether you want to add this, that, & the other at the last minute. I like the variety of ingredients that can be put on the sandwich to make it full. Now & again they're not consistent so not everything that I on the bag show up on the sandwich. Even so it's probably one of the better sandwich places in town."}
{"text":"I like the bowlwich & skinnywich. This place has tons of healthy options and a good kid's meal. This location has helpful and friendly employees."}
{"text":"A good place for a quick lunch. I tried their tuna sandwich on wheat bread with jalapeños, very good."}
{"text":"I'm adding this to my list of places for lunch.  We went on a weekday at 11:45am and though there was about 5 ppl in front of us, we really didn't wait very long to submit our order and to get our food.  This place was quite busy already and got almost crowded by the time we had finished our meal... so, tip: come before noon!

I am a huge Italian sandwich fan and it is usually what I use to determine if I'll return to a 'sub/sandwich' kind of place... well, WW did not disappoint.  I loved the extreme customization (literally, you pick everything out) and the ease of ordering on the little paper bag - genius!  I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich and even took a picture of my paper bag to know what to get next time.  My two friends that accompanied me to lunch also enjoyed their sandwich... plus, at just under $6 for a filling sandwich, it can't be beat.

I recommend stopping by this place and enjoying a custom sandwich... oh yeah, staff was very helfpul and quick, too."}
{"text":"Interesting concept, and might do alright because of location, but not really my \"bag\".

You walk up, you can barely see the open sign somewhat glowing through the window of this extremely new place.  You walk in, there is no one to take your order, but there is a whole bunch of bags and sharpies.  Hmmmm?  The idea is, you write on the bag what exactly you want, then hand it to them and pay.  Seems quicker/more efficient than the subway way, but much less personable.  Fits right in with this extremely busy Trader Joes and Best buy area.  I was not quick or efficient, I kind of just stared at the wall, looked around for a little bit, and then eventually began to write on my bag.

The place was clean, the lights were bright, and the Charlotte Observer was on the wall.

I was taking my mom out for a quick bite, so we just decided to share a sub when I noticed it was going to come out to over $11 for a 10\" sub, chips, and a drink.  She noticed a sign about an avocado turkey for only $1 more.  I went for it.  Turns out that avocado is $1.50 more, so over $12 for a medium combo and still had to buy another drink.

It came out relatively fast and its was good, but nothing special.  Kind of similar to Jersey Mikes if I had to compare to a mainstream chain.  The bag of \"house chips\" were decent.  Pretty small and a little over salted.  But the drinks oh wow.  They've got a tea machine that spits out 4 different kinds of tea.  2/3 green tea, with a splash of raspberry, truly the highlight of my outing.

All in all, I don't think I necessarily wasted my money going there, but for 2 people at lunch, I would have been just as going to the sushi buffet at Pisces, or even happy spending less money and getting 2 spicy chicken combo's at the Wendy's across the street.  Sorry which wich, maybe next time."}
{"text":"I haven't had a bad sandwich here, yet.  The ones that I have had allowed me to be braver about trying new ones.   They also have awesome ice (yup, ice).  Similar to Sonic Drive In's."}
{"text":"Which Wich is a very creative and welcome addition to the area! This was my first time visiting here and I'm already looking forward to going back!

Great concept, you walk in and pick up a bag based on whatever kind of sandwich  you want, they have everything from turkey and ham to tuna salad and the beloved classic club!

Once you decide which sandwich you want, you can get to work creating your masterpiece. I opted for the Classic- Club. Turkey, ham and bacon with pepper jack cheese. 

For toppings I selected lettuce, banana peppers, jalapenos, red onions, deli mustard, chipotle mayo, vinegar and salt, pepper and oregano. I don't think I possibly could have added anything more. 

The sandwich was delicious, I chose the wheat bread which was flaky and freshly baked. The sandwich was delicious! I enjoyed the combinations of meat and toppings and it was just a great sandwich. 

I agree with the other reviews, for the price, this a a great sandwich and I cant wait to enjoy another one!"}
{"text":"Probably the BEST hot sandwich from a fast food restaurant, absolutely delicious!! Service is sorta lacking and it takes awhile to get your sandwich. I'm good though the food is incredible and that's all that really matters to me!"}
{"text":"This is the best quality:speed ratio of any sandwich shop in town. The service is fantastic. The sandwiches are top notch. The quality is there, the freshness is there, the price is reasonable. I've been going here every day for a week straight and it's been consistently phenomenal. The sandwich doesn't fall apart halfway through; and you get a consistent bite every time. For me a big part of the sandwich is the bread and these guys have nailed it. I usually go with the Italian grinder on wheat. 

Restrooms are clean as well. Service is great - I've been here at all times of the day and night and I feel like I've seen all of their employees by now. All friendly. 

5 stars all around from me."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, fast service. I usually try whatever specials they have at the moment, haven't had any that wowed me but nothing bad either. I don't really care for their metal stool seats however. It is really uncomfortable as the seats are hard and tiny. I'm a petite person myself and I can't imagine it being at all comfortable for someone bigger."}
{"text":"After visiting this place a few more times I am absolutely addicted! Everyone I have taken with me loves it too. I'm not a huge veggie person so Which Wich is perfect - there are LOTS of other options other than the veggie/healthy stuff (crispy onion strings OMG!!). My brother likes it too because he says the sandwich makers aren't judging you (as they do at Subway it seems) when you say no to all the veggies going down the line. Just grab your bag, mark what you want and you got it!

Be sure to sign up for their \"Vibe Club\" to get extra savings (free sub on your birthday and lots of other discounts).  Buy the larger drink for 50cents more for a cup you can keep/reuse and bring it back for 50cents off your next visit!"}
{"text":"Bomb subs with great customer service, I always get the Italian grinder 
Tops most of the sub places I ever been at"}
{"text":"Finally tried this sub place, and it was just okay. Probably won't try it again. I had the Meatball Grinder, which sounded amazing, but was kinda just eh. The  meatballs weren't spectacular or anything. It's on Mill so it's not really convenient, and the ordering system is just weird. You fill out a bag and give it to the cashier, so not hard, just weird. It wasn't busy at all when I came in, and I can only imagine that gets pretty chaotic during a typical Mill Ave lunch hour."}
{"text":"The Wicked is by far the Best sandwich I've ever put in my mouth!"}
{"text":"I love which wich!! Great way to make and serve sandwiches.  The bags make ordering fun and easy to get exactly what I want.  I am a loyal customer.  So much better than subway."}
{"text":"A solid sandwich.. Agree the order process needs tweaking but some nice smartphone integration including order through payment could be huge. 

Gives Capriottis a run for its money.. I will be back"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a Yelp-er Elite member, so I thought I would try it out.  

It's unlike any sandwich shop I have ever been to.  You walk in, and you have to create your own sandwich.  

The place is intimidating.  You create your own and have a MILLION options from bread to condiments to toasted to not, the list goes on and on.  You make your selections on a brown pre-printed bag and pre pay.  

Let me say this, if you don't have a good idea what you want or good sandwich combinations, this is going to be a disaster.  I went with my fiance and he made a sandwich that was AWFUL.  I on the other hand really enjoyed mine.  I'm a bit of a sandwich snob truth be told. 

The ingredients were fresh and the sandwich was well crafted and they definitely do not skimp on the quantity.  

This place is good, really good.  Why not 5 stars?  It would have been a little better to know how to order rather than figure it out on your own.  

There is also less than ample seating, which makes a big difference since it's always packed."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the Which Wich brand. I think it's fast, convenient and you get exactly what you want! Be sure to sign up for the e-club, as they send coupons frequently for free drinks, subs and more. This location is always very clean. Parking stinks here, as you have to pay at the curb or walk from somewhere. Would highly recommend over subway, quiznos, etc! Way more options and a cheaper price!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazeballs!!!!  I will never eat at subway again after finding this spot!!  Their concept is awesome, the sandwiches are delicious and the people that work there are so nice and friendly.  I pick up lunch here at least 2 to 3 times a week for my office and the general consensus and feed back on each sandwich is outstanding!!  I personally am addicted to the chicken cordon blue, on wheat, toasted, with swiss, lettuce, tomato's and lite mayo...it always hits the spot!!  This place is a MUST try trust me!!!"}
{"text":"I finally tried Which Wich after I have heard SO many people raving about it! I was a little overwhelmed by the number of choices that were on the menu on the wall. But as soon as i walked in, a very nice young lady walked over to show me how the ordering process works. :) You pick a type of sandwich, like ham, turkey, club, beef.. and then narrow your choice down to a specific sandwich, like Roast beef. Then you add all of the toppings, dressings and sauces that you want for basically no charge. You can totally make a crazy sandwich if you want! 

I stood staring at the menu for a while and finally decided to go safe with just a turkey, ham and cheese sub with fixin's. I think I only went the safe route because I was worried that I would try something new and hate it.. 

The sandwich was as good as it could be considering it was so run of the mill. The ingredients tastes very fresh and the service was obviously awesome. The sub only took a few minutes to make and wasn't too expensive either. I am looking forward to returning to try many different options. Let me know if you know of any crazy good combinations that I should try!"}
{"text":"This place has the best sandwiches and customer service is top notch! The food is always fresh and the employees are very friendly. They were very accommodating for our toddler and we really appreciated it."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. It was my first time there. So go big or go home. I got the wicked five meat sandwich. Delish.  I saw some people complain about how long the wait is. You can't rush perfection. So if you don't mind waiting maybe 7 mins then come here. I am a huge sandwich person and am very critical on it being awesome or its not worth my time.  Blows Jimmy Jon's out of the water. Heavy on meat not just bulking it up with lettuce. Enjoy if you try it. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place while visiting the medical plaza at Thompson Peak Hospital. The burger & beer place across the way grabbed my attention but I wanted to give this place a try it was very inviting. Went in with a family member for some lunch. I seen the bags and automatically knew it was a \"ordering\" system, going to a burger place known for paper bag ordering I knew what to do. Grabbed a 9 bag and chose a BLT, I had no idea what to put on it so I just checked a few things that looked good. The place was very clean & it was quite busy.. When I had got my order it exceeded my expectations of a sandwich I had got the medium version and it was a good size. The sandwich looked better than expected. The bread was the best part so good... I also might say this place is a A++++ for crushed ice!!! Can't wait to go back again.."}
{"text":"This is one of the better quality sandwich places we go to.  It does take time but the sandwiches and selections to customize are very good.  

We ordered a 7\" white egg with double meat as well as a turkey with bacon in the side.  No drink or chips came to $17.

There are promos for signing up to text Alerts which can be rewarding."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick dinner I ventured to try a sandwich place. It was recommended to go there in which I've been hesitant to go but in surprise it was actually good! For a first timer I immediately ordered the seasonal special: gyro! You pick a paper sandwich bag that coordinates to your sandwich and mark any listed special requests on the bag.  Varies from bread type, meats, sauces, veggies, etc. For shakes and cookies you mark a different card. Pay at the cash register to the nice worker. My authentic gyro was around $8. I never knew crinkled French fries work well in a gyro! Great comfort food. The paper sandwich bag was hung up at the line with a pin sturdy enough to hold the wich.  Write your name on the bag so they can call your name when the order is ready. 
The cookie was warmed up on the open toaster and nicely warm for the winter that's soon to arrive. Oozing chocolate came at each bite. Yum! 
They have a loyalty program card. For every 10 sandwiches bought you get one sandwich free! Eat up!"}
{"text":"They got rid of the Cuban

Ok so lots of other stuff on the menu, but....  why do you only have 1 person working at 5:30 pm on a week day"}
{"text":"For a quick meal, this is the spot. 

I have an unreasonable passion for sandwiches. However, I cannot stand sandwich shops. I don't like standing across the counter from someone while they stare at me waiting for my decisions. I like to think my sandwiches over good and hard. The fact that I can grab a bag and create my sandwich in peace without feeling rushed and judged is a.m.a.z.i.n.g. The choices are excellent with a wide variety of toppings, meats, and bread, and if you don't want to think too hard about it, they have pre-fabricated options as well. I love handing my bag off, continuing my awesome conversation and then picking up my sandwich when it's complete. The sandwiches themselves are delicious. Cold or toasted, I have not been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Located near the intersection of S. Market St and S. Santan Village Pkwy, near the south-east corner. Enter the mall next to Wendy's and Big Lots, head east a short distance. Easy parking and access off Market St and the parkway. This place is a few hundred feet east of Wendy's.

You enter, walk over to the rack of bags, find the category your desired sandwich is found in, grab that bag, mark your bread, size, toppings, and any extras you like. One sandwich per bag. Tolerate the upsell at the register. Sit and wait for your name to be called. There's a TV and the music is too loud. People behind the counter calling names are hard to understand because the music is too loud.

The food is 'average' for subs. Perhaps a tiny slice above subway but much slower. It would be a good idea to research online what sandwich you want and what toppings you want before you go, so you know what category bag to grab. Otherwise, the ordering process is a little odd and can be a big put off if you go in unprepared.

I would have given 4 stars if the food had been tastier and service faster.

Summary: good selection, good ingredients, average taste, slow service, loud environment, higher than average cost, same appeal as Subway. Very similar to Jimmy Johns but with better service."}
{"text":"The process is not efficient to me. There are like 10+ different sandwich bags for each type of sandwich, which seemed confusing, at least for first time visits. However, we were happy with our sandwiches which were Banh Mi, the Reuben and a ham sandwich. The kids meal was more than the usual with baby carrots and an apple to accompany the sandwich."}
{"text":"Been here about twelve times, only had an order mix-up once, which they corrected without making any issue.

Here's the process: Walk-in (research the menu online at home before you go) find the proper paper envelope on one of the carousels which has the category and kind of sandwich you want. Start at the top marking how you want it fixed, one sandwich per envelope. 

After marking, hand it in to the person at the register then wait for your name to get called. Be warned, it is hard to hear your name called due to the noise in the restaurant and the way the counters are built. I put a big red mark on the back of the envelope so I can see where it is in the process and when it comes off the clothes line, ready for me to pick-up. 

I've had both the Italian Grinder and Muffelleta both of which are decent. I've eaten them at home the next day after all night in the refrigerator and found them still decent. 

Parking can be a problem here. The parking lot is cramped and tiny. This is one of those lots that's laid out on a computer, so traffic only flows well in theory, be patient and be prepared to park further away and walk.

I've found the staff is always professional and work focused. The inside always clean. My only complaints are how hard it is to hear your name called, and the parking lot being designed around the Smart Car.

Just an FYI: sliced tomatoes on a sub leads to ingredients sliding and the sub falling apart. I love sliced toms but find eating is a much nicer experience without the tomatoes.

If you go here during lunch or dinner time be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes for your food to be prepared.

You might want to check the nutrition info on their web site before frequenting this place, the numbers are not great which is sort of no surprise when compared to other sub shops."}
{"text":"Friends at work helped me tune in to Which Wich's opening.  If you like Potbelly's you're gonna love Which Wich.  They do the conveyor belt sandwich toasting machine thingy and the bread is very similar.  

They won me over with the crazy variety of sandwich options.  I love their muffaletta olive topping and their honey mustard.  Can't wait to try something else!

They're at the south east corner of Park & Woodlawn, above Jason's Deli, on the upper level row of shops."}
{"text":"Better Than Subway, Better Than Jimmy Johns. This remarkable sub sandwich restaurant is a miracle waiting to happen. All they have to do is make commercials and make this an amazing food chain.
I highly recommend eating at which which."}
{"text":"My sister and I visited for the first time and it was very good. She is not one to like a lot of bread on her sandwich so the thin which option where they hollow out the bread was a great option for her. We both had toasted French dips and they were very good. Loved the flavor of both the beef and the broth. The cookies were good but not great. The chips were very good and made a nice addition to the meal. 
The meal was a bit pricey but we both agreed it was worth it. We will eat here again!"}
{"text":"Place is closed.  Sign on door says that the landlord changed locks on May 24.  Appears out of business."}
{"text":"Man, this place is overwhelming on your first visit. You have to pick a bag for your sandwich that is all dependent on what category it's in (ie: turkey, ham, veggie etc). Once you process that there is an option for just about anything you could possibly want, you let your hands & a magic market get to work by completing the check-list on the bag of what ingredients you'd like on your sub. 

Since it was my first trip to a Which Wich, I decided to go with their 'Signature' sandwich, The Wicked. It's Turkey, Ham, Roast Beef, Pepperoni, Bacon & 3 cheeses of your choice all deliciously piled together on your choice of bread (or lettuce wrap for those carb-counters of there). Pretty much any topping you could possibly want on a sub is there for an option at no additional charge, as is a plethora of dressings/sauces. 

My only 'complaint' would be that they don't have a \"meal deal\" option like most other sandwich shops. If you want chips and a drink, you're paying separately for each item as everything is a la carte. Not a huge deal, but it's always nice to save a few pennies when you can. A small sub is big enough for the average eater and I believe most of them are $5.60."}
{"text":"First time coming here. Tasted like every other sub shop, which isn't a bad thing. 

I was turned off by the employees conversation. We were there 15 mins and I heard a boy complaining how a girl he trained makes a dollar more than him, \"they are so lucky I don't have another job lined up\" and \"I'd like to see her try to open this place in the morning.\""}
{"text":"They have a wide variety of meat and vegetarian options. I love that you can get any sub either hot or cold. (Capriotti's has a similar sub to Which Wich's turkey/stuffing/cranberry, but it only comes cold.) I also like the idea of customizing each sub with exactly what you want (why I dislike Jimmy John's) and the brown bag concept is cool.

I decided to get a salad instead of a sandwich. Love that they have spinach as a salad option. I chose a gyro salad and added raw onion, tomato, and pesto. The veggies were very fresh and though I have had much better gyro meat elsewhere, their's was still good. I would have liked a bit more meat, but paying extra for double meat would have resulted in too much food for me to eat. My friend got the Thank You Turkey served hot, and thought it was tasty.

However, the highlight of the trip was the shakes! I found it kind of weird that the best thing at a sub shop was the shakes, but they were soooo good. You have a choice of vanilla, chocolate, banana, pineapple, oreo, or strawberry. There is also an option to add malt, extra flavoring, or (my favorite) an actual banana. We each got a chocolate shake with extra chocolate and banana. My friend opted for malt as well. I was hesitant to add the banana at first but was so glad I did! It adds a subtle banana flavor and creamy texture to the shake. It was truly one of the best shakes I've ever had. 

We spent $24 between 2 people which I think is reasonable for a regular size salad, a 10\" sub, and two shakes with added banana. 

I would give the food a 3.5 out of 5. It's nothing amazing but they have good, solid subs and the ability to customize anything exactly how you like it. The amazing shakes bump my rating up to a 4, though. :)"}
{"text":"Unique place, in that you fill out your bag, which \"builds\" your sandwich with the stuff you want on it... What kind of bread, mayo, mustard, lettuce, spinach, etc. etc. Cool concept. Much better than Subway, where you actually have to speak with the person making your sandwich. (We all hate that, right)? Anyway, really fresh toppings and bread at this joint, friendly and clean environment, will come back here again."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte on business and it was lunch time so I put in Which Wich into Yelp and it found this one that was quite close to where I was working. The parking situation was difficult, as this is an outdoor type shopping area with many stores and restaurants. After circling the parking lot a few times and dropping off my friends in front of Which Wich, i found a parking spot by a wine store. Note to self, check out wine store if I have time. But anyway I quickly joined my friends who had just ordered and placed my order. We sat at a table and waited for our orders and like magic a woman employee asked us our names and said she would bring our sandwiches to us. I love this. A fairy godmother at Which Wich. But anyway, we got our sandwiches from this wonderful employee and had a delightful lunch. This location is very busy, has lots of seating and is bright and cheerful. Great job for this Which Wich."}
{"text":"One star is all they deserve! I walked in first time on Saturday. Had no clue how to order ! No one even tried to assist me. So I went ahead and ordered a gyro wrap. Let me just say how gross it was !!! Meat tasted like rubber. Tziki sauce had no flavor. I threw away my food and walked out. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing here ? Who knows ?First and last time here ..."}
{"text":"We ate inside Which Wich when they first had opened and we had been blown away by what great staff worked there. They explained everything and we were very impressed at how charismatic and nice they all were...That was a long time ago....
 Today we walked in and there were no customers inside (approximately 4:00 pm) the employee behind the counter said NOTHING. Since we had been there before we knew how it works so, we grabbed bags and started writing out what we wanted...we saw that there was a 2nd male employee there whom also said nothing. We gave our order to the 1st guy, paid and still nothing said...we barely heard our names called to say our order was ready...still nothing said. No music no noise no talking empty place ....an old lady came in and we laughed as they said nothing to her either. She obviously had been there before because she filled out the bag and sat to wait for her order...3 other people came in...hmm nothing said to them either. The 3 got their orders and left...like 5 mins later the cashier said  to the old lady \"uhhh your order is down there\" the lady picked it up and left...no thank you,no bye...no nothing. We finished eating, threw our trash away and laughed in shock between eachother that nothing was said as we walked out either. So awful having good sandwiches and such horrible customer service. Hey some people might enjoy not hearing ANYTHING when going out to eat...but MOST will like it a lot more if there are friendly ,helpful courteous employees....Just saying! There's so many people looking for work...It would help your place be way more desirable if you got some new employees. ...like the ones that were there originally. 
  The food was good. No complaint there. I hope others have a better time while eating in there....well and while picking up to go orders. What's better then good food served to you by a friendly ,smiling face?? I hope it's better next time I eat there..if we ever do...I'd give more stars if it had been like it was when 1st opened."}
{"text":"Just opened Monday. Good food. We got a wicked which and a beef with cheez wiz and carmalized onions. Both were very good. Workers were friendly and helpful. We will go back ! Lots of choices to choose from"}
{"text":"We decided to try something different today. Based on the reviews I thought it would be a great however, a few hours after eating a French dip I had intense stomach pain-like food poisoning and not a good experience. To me the meat that was used was no better than the poor quality meat Subway uses. For the price for two sandwiches chips and 1 shake $26.00 seems ridiculous. Sorry but was really hoping it would be good as I would be the first to support local but it definitely was not."}
{"text":"Very good buffalo chicken sandwich on Fresh roll/bread. Good portion size for money. Jill was so sweet and helpful- love her hospitality- a real keeper! Everyone did job great. I will be back"}
{"text":"I came in to order 4 sandwiches for coworkers and it took the people working here 5 min to figure out how to prepare to make them. I was in a hurry and was prepared to order and get in and out with no one in front of me. I will be sticking to other sandwich shops as this one is not efficient with their time."}
{"text":"Don't understand the hype. We enjoy all of the other sandwich restaurants (even Subway) more then this. Perhaps we didn't try the right sandwiches but  it is hard to justify the cost when the sandwich is just mediocre. Enjoy the bread more at Jimmy John's and the  meat and toppings at Potbelly. We did enjoy the ordering system and service was good."}
{"text":"16$ for a Italian sub with extra meat and combo with chips and soda?.. Why would I do that? Subway can do the same for 10$.. The process of it just annoying. No suggestions on what's good. Just names and you pick what you want it's like subway but complicated and expensive. It's like trying to do present day algebra homework without a Ti-84. It's just annoying and not worth it. Jersey Mikes makes it simple and so does Jimmy Johns. Subway has the make your own sub on lockdown even tho it's played out. Also no description on foods like there is but like 4 words. At least they have 5 different selections of chips.... Tables are small for four people. Customer service isn't any good. He saw me staring at the menu for a good 5 minutes and didn't say a word to me. Idk maybe try helping me out? Just not a good place to be honest. It's trying to get into the sub sandwich business and just fails."}
{"text":"There are many sub places in Solon and this place is only one step up from Subway. Would rather go pretty much anywhere else. The food is just not good. :/"}
{"text":"I'll admit I was a little confused about how to order when I first walked in the door, but after staring at the menu board for about 5 minutes I had it all figured out.  I was impressed by the large number of sandwich options.  There are a ton of meats to choose from and even a decent sized vegetarian menu.  And all the sandwiches come with a seemingly endless amount of topping choices that are already included in the price (there are a few toppings that cost extra like avocado and bacon).  I really wanted to try the peanut butter, honey, and banana sandwich but the buffalo chicken was calling my name too.  I ended up with the buffalo chicken and I was not disappointed!  Everything about the sandwich was delicious from the yummy toasted wheat bread to the perfect amount of meat and toppings.  This might be one of my new favorite sandwich places.  I didn't try any sides but they have chips, cookies, and milk shakes available as well.

The atmosphere is kind of cold and boring with little to no decor and silver chairs with silver-topped tables, but their indoor space is really small and I don't know what else they could do with it.

Just a couple other notes...  The ice machine spits out little pieces of round crushed ice.  While this isn't a huge deal for me the hubby goes crazy over this stuff because he likes to eat it after finishing his drink.  I liked that they have one of those Gold Peak tea dispensers and plenty of Splenda to go around.  Glorious."}
{"text":"Love this place. Awesome way of ordering sandwiches and the food is great and the staff is awesome. I come here a lot and I have to say that their sandwiches are great. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good concept. Weak product. Sandwiches are overpriced for quality and quantity. I will not recommend or revisit. Sorry Which Wich. Wish I could have been satisfied with your sandwiches."}
{"text":"Wow! What a FANTASTIC concept!  Menu is on the bag & using a red sharpie you make your choices...and my, my, my...what choices! 
I went with the regular 7 inch turkey, toasted white bread, mayo,  avocado, bacon & pickles. Unbelievable! They offer the Vickie's line of kettle chips, which I love.

Staff was super friendly & helpful to this (new) process of ordering. And I am a stickler for sanitation grades & was happy to see this place has a 101 rating!  I went on a Sunday afternoon, right at 12, so there was a steady stream of church folks & 20-somethings. Service was quick.
I will say the shop is rather small & the tables are placed close together. We didn't eat in, rather took our sandwiches to go. 
Prices are reasonable. This is my new favorite go to sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Oh Which Wich...I love you!

The ordering process is marketing genius!  Bags are are neatly organized for you based on your meat/protein choice. Then comes the fun part...deciding any & everything you want on that sandwich. Veggies, condiments, type of bread, extras, etc. It's a bit overwhelming, but I have a favorite combination that I stick with: turkey with white bread (toasted), pickles, avocado, pepper jack cheese, & bacon.

Friendly employees make my experience so much better. The employees here get my top vote for their attentiveness & customer service.

Reasonable prices. $7.75 for a \"combo\" meal, which includes a (regular) 7 inch sub, chips & a drink. However, the (regular) 7 inch sub alone is $5.25 & it's filling! They also offer treats such as cookies & milkshakes.

They offer catering, as well as online ordering.

I definitely choose Which Wich over Quiznos now."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of Which Wich, but do have a slight problem with this location. It is small & parking is definitely an issue.  On today's visit (a Sunday around 12:30 PM - think church crowd), we had to park over by the boutiques & Pisces Sushi - in one of the 30 minute spaces...which we took ALL of that 30 minutes.

I absolutely adore their ordering system - pure genius! It's not like Subway; where you're behind someone who just can't decide on what all they want on their sandwich, all the while holding people up. 

Because it was SO busy, it really did take about 15 minutes or more to actually get our food - & we were taking it \"to go\"! We ordered a regular rench dip (for me) & my boyfriend got the regular chicken cordon bleu. 

In addition to the small space, the pluses are friendly employees & a clean space. Their prices aren't bad either. I love the insane amount of choices you have for ordering. So many combinations, but you can also order a \"set\" sandwich.

On to the food!  We got home & thankfully, my au jus made the trip successfully. It was still warm. :) Bread was just the right amount of \"toastiness\" (made that up!) & the roast beef was chopped up - which was odd to me, but it tasted REALLY good.  Add my Miss Vickie's jalapeño chips & I was one happy (& full) girl. Shawn was \"ok\" with this chicken cordon bleu - he (for some reason) wasn't expecting the chicken to be actual chicken lunch meat & not an actual fried piece of chicken. :D

Being in the busy Met area, it's safe to say this place will always be busy. Good luck!"}
{"text":"This place has the most exceptional service! They go leaps and bounds to provide quality food and service to third customers! My office orders from them weekly and we've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"The people working here are amazing.  Extremely friendly and welcoming, generous, and it's obvious they enjoy working together.  The owner Scott treated my girlfriend and I with so much kindness and respect and even more so toward his employees.  It's no surprise he's from Chicago!  ;). Oh yeah- and did I mention the sandwiches are bomb?  I promised myself I'll be back for a visit and more sandwiches every time I'm in town visiting my family.  Eat here, chat 'em up, and have an higher-than-expectations experience with these guys.  So happy to have met them.  Thanks again for the waters, Scott!

{"text":"I've been to this location a few times in the past and the only thing I've had to complain about were the dirty tables and bathroom. Today, I handed my order to the cashier only to find out that they were out of wraps. After changing my order and asking for a soda, I find out they are also out of Co2 and can only sell tea or lemonade. All of this is understandable, but where are the signs? Is there anything else they're out of that I should know about? I myself am in the food industry, and my restaurants have always posted a note on whatever we are sold out of/whatever machine is down for the customer's convenience. This location wasn't at all busy when I went in, so I'm not sure why there couldn't have been at least some sticky notes in place. Very disappointed and will not be visiting this location in the future."}
{"text":"Worst sandwich I have ever had from any place ever.  So bad it pissed me off after 2 bites of yuck that I didnt eat the rest.  The meat is beyond gross with all kinds of salt and preservatives and other chemicals added.  The quality to me was something like the cheapest deli meat you would find in the grocery store but not from the deli.  You know what I am talking about.  Mystery meat."}
{"text":"Glad I gave them a shot in spite of other reviews and a friend of mine who was under-impressed. If it weren't for the buy one/get one coupon, I probably would have delayed or avoided stoping in. 

As soon as I walked in, a gal greeted me asked if it was my first time and I said \"yes\". She came over and gave me a quick tutorial of the menu and ordering process. Ok got it! Time to order...

I ordered a tuna and an Italian grinder. I must say off the rip, I was impressed by the variety of sandwich options, cheeses, condiments and toppings. Far more options than Subway, Potbelly and even Jimmy Johns (which I love). I also liked that the bread was good without being overwhelming (all bread-no filler like Subway).  

My order was correct and didn't take very long (5-6 minutes) considering I ordered two custom sammies When folks say it took forever, I wonder if they're also calculating the time it took them to decide then check-mark the sandwich bag. If I add that time, then yes, it took me about 15m or so to order and leave. 

I'd definitely go back and soon! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat at and the service is wonderful. People should eat here more. But it's a cool and good place to go spend quality family time any day."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends as one of them talked this place up.  It's a sandwich shop but the ordering process is a little different.  You walk in to see the menu on the board and you pick a brown bag and mark what kind of sub that you want along with the different toppings.  You give your bag to the cashier and then your bag gets clipped to a cord and moves down the line as your sandwich is being created.  The one option I wished they added to the bag is if you want it hot or cold.  They usually do it hot, and I was asked if I wanted it cold since I ordered a turkey salad sandwich.  The sandwich was pretty decent...I think I should of chose less toppings.  They also had a younger girl who acted like a runner.  She greeted everyone, asked if they knew how to order, and constantly asked if everything was good.  It's nice they have someone like that, but was starting to get annoying.  I bet she gets a crap load of steps during her shift."}
{"text":"Yay I'm a fan!..I'm on the road constantly for work which means a lot of lunches out.  Some people might think that is great but it sucks when your constantly surrounded by fast food and looking for some healthier options.  This is why I love Which Wich they are popping up all over the Queen City and I'm excited.  The ordering process is awesome take your brown bag pick what you want on your sandwich hand it to the friendly person at the register and in a few minutes you have a perfect sandwiich just the way you wanted it.  They also make their own chips which are delicious and an extra star just for crushed ice that is a big plus.  So take a break from subway, sub station etc. and check this place out."}
{"text":"Made it into this new location during a busy lunch hour to see what the buzz was all about. After seeing the other locations in town, the location at the Met was definitely a good spot for them to land. 

First, being at The Met, you're in for a hell of a time finding a parking space. Next to impossible during a busy lunch hour or evening when everyone in Charlotte decides to shop at Trader Joe's. If you're lucky enough, snag a spot on the street for easy in and out of there. Not fun when you're on a time crunch for a meeting or getting back to the office. 

The space inside is pretty small. Not hospitable for 50 hungry, business professionals from Uptown. Standing room is limited. Get ready to brush some shoulders!

The order system is hilariously fun. You mark your order on designated bags with red sharpies and then they hang them above the makeline! Really fun to watch. With my imagination and heart being that of my 4-year-old self, I really enjoyed this. It makes it fun to order what you want on the sandwich and not go with the cookie cutter choices like other sandwich shops. 

The house chips are really good, too. Seasoned lightly and served in an innocuous paper bag. I appreciate that. 

I ordered the chicken salad. I probably added way too many toppings, but it was good. A bit on the creamy side, but the bread was thick and chewy. It made up for the overt creaminess. The buffalo sauce they have is a nice addition! I'm sure it would be great on just about any sandwich they have there. 

Pretty solid choice for lunch. Beware of crowds and parking crazies!"}
{"text":"I Tried which wich today for the first time.  I had the tomato and avocado, I loved all of the options you have for adding to the sandwich.  At $5.50 it seems like a great deal, the 7in sandwich was filled nicely.   I had marked it to be a cold sandwich but after I ate half (it was precut in half) I was curios how it would be toasted.  I asked if they could toast the other and and they did... Way better.  The bread tastes completely different and becomes chewy and gets a great crust.  I recommend having your sandwich toasted!

Excited to try it again as their non meat options are abundant!"}
{"text":"Just meh.  The one I ate at in Vegas was much better. Service was slow (only 2 people working on a Saturday), and when I got my Cheeseburger Eggwhich, there was no egg....

It wasn't good, I just scarfed it down as quickly as I could.  No diet Coke, there was a hand scribbled note over the dispenser.  Probably won't go back, too many good food places in that area."}
{"text":"I had never heard of them but the kids thought that the name was funny/inviting. We are greeted promptly and asked if it was our first time. They explained the ordering system quickly. Our 'wiches were made to order promptly and they were delicious. Later I googled them and found that they are a new chain and are opening stores all over. They are worth a try!!"}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous review where I shared my formerly top-secret recipe for the best WW chicken sandwich in the West.

Having taken a 180 degree turn in my diet, I will no longer be eating that amazing chicken sandwich, but, do not fear! There is hope -- thanks to the WW black bean patty.  As a matter of fact, the already world-class sandwich may be even better *without* chicken.

Here's how you roll....vegetarian style!

Grab Bag #6 -- Vegetarian

Then mark the following circles...
Black Bean Patty
Wheat Bread
Toasted
(pick your size)
Pepper Jack Cheese (optional)
Hummus
Tzatziki
Tomatoes
Cucumbers
Olive Salad
Salt
Pepper

Bam!  Pay your tab and wait for the slab of delicious goodness to emerge!

Hint:  write something unique on the back of your bag so you can track it down the assembly line."}
{"text":"Went to which which today well after the lunch rush and ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with cheese, pickles, tomato, avocado and ranch (see picture). When I got back to my desk I discovered they had left off the pickles, ranch and avocado - which I had to pay extra for. Seemed like a straight forward order to have left so many ingredients off. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Same great Which Wich, now with 50% more slooooooooow.  Maybe it's just me but it always seems to take twice as long to get my sandwich here as at the Park Rd location. That being said, the sandwiches are just as tasty. Which Wich is quality product and it is because of that I am willing to wait, and to brave parking at the Met...on a Friday evening...on my way to the airport. So swing by when you have a (generous) few minutes. I suggest the gyro or black bean patty. And don't forget to load up on the olive spread."}
{"text":"The best part about my experience was the set-up and ordering options. The sandwiches were lacking meat and flavor. The bread was hot and tasty but wasn't enough to make up for the overall sandwich. Probably will never go back."}
{"text":"This is tough since compition in this area is fierce when coming to sandwich shops.  I liked this place, love the selection of sandwiches and all that you can do for them.  The ordering system is at first confusing but once you get it, it is easy.  

The shakes are great, amazing and something that takes things up a notch."}
{"text":"Since I had never tried this place and was in the mood for a turkey sandwich I walked in and was very impressed. First of all, I was approached by Markel who was a real sweetheart. He was very helpful in informing me about the menu and how to order my sandwich. The cashier named Maya was equally as sweet. And the food was made quickly by the cooks and was very delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches and they are reasonably priced.  I really like this place.  If I had to choose between Firehouse Subs and Which Wich, then I would choose Which Wich everytime.  The ability to customize your sandwich makes this place appealing.  It's an easy ordering process and the food is fast and fresh!"}
{"text":"This just became my new favorite sandwich shop. The ingredients were awesome and the ordering concept was incredibly convenient and brilliant."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 sandwiches, first sandwich had 4 items to put on sandwich. I received 1. Ordered glass of milk which was poured from the jug they use for their milkshakes, curdled and awful sour!
I love Which Wich; but this one is LOUSY. 
I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love the number of customized options this place gives!! You can truly order whatever you want and it's delicious!"}
{"text":"This place can turn any of their sandwiches in a lettuce wrapped sandwich.  I've tried and love their BBQ pork and slaw, crab and artichoke, gyros, and muffaletta.  I've like them all, plus this crew is very energetic and fun."}
{"text":"Heard about Which Wich from a friend and it was as good as he said it was. Ordered the Cuban sandwich and it was as good as it is in Miami. Loved the bread and the hot peppers. This is now our new favorite sandwich place."}
{"text":"I've placed several large group orders in the past, and they have always handled them well. Apparently, they ran out of medium white bread this evening, but actually gave me a free sandwich just to make up for it! A very nice gesture. Will definitely continue to order here :)"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich and service. The bread was great and the sandwich was full of meats and vegetables and was very filling. Oreo shake was thick and excellent. Highly recommend. I had the turkey club sandwich."}
{"text":"Never had a bad sandwich here, including breakfast. \"Skinny\" your wich (they take out the innerds of the bread) for a less dough filled option. Shakes are also delicious and staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Nice people, but expensive and had to throw out my sandwich!

Spent close to 13.00 for a 10 inch combo, but couldn't eat the sandwich.... ordered a BLT, a classic....didn't know it was constructed of BACON BITS and shredded lettuce.

The whole thing fell apart, right out of the bread and to the floor - first bite! Impossible to handle or eat, I had to throw it out.... wasted the sandwich, but got to eat the chips and drink.... somehow, I\"m still hungry - go figure....

However, the people there are wonderful, best service you'll find.... courteous, kind, helpful and seem as though they're having fun.... if not, they've totally fooled me!!

I will go back to try another sandwich, maybe roast beef or turkey, something solid...The bread (what I had of it) was fresh and tasted wonderful.   Just don't bother with the Bacon on any sandwich, its just bacon crumbles....  and they fall all over you and where ever you eat,,,,

Gotta say, the sandwich quality could have been way, way better.  
And the parking is really a challenge since this is next to a PeiWei...."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to go to Which Wich on a recent Saturday afternoon, and my first impressions of Which Which are mostly positive.

What I like most about Which Wich is the uniqueness of the joint.  The whole order via circling your choices on a pad with a pencil; ordering format works, and reminds me of a burrito-joint in Chapel Hill by the name of Armadillo Grill.  I like that there really are no set, pre-made subs.  Everything is made fresh to order and is tailored to your specific topping and sauce needs.  

I will say that the parking lot was a little hectic and the inside felt a bit chaotic as well.  There weren't many available seats and it looked like the Tasmanian Devil had just run through the place.

As far as the actual taste of my sub, it was excellent.  All the ingredients tasted fresh and my sandwich was made to my specifications.

Despite the interior, the service was excellent and the sub tasted good enough that I  would def like to return to Which Wich again, perhaps giving the location at the MET a shot."}
{"text":"Just had the Reuben sandwich on wheat. Outstanding! Surpasses subway by leaps and bounds. And the bread compliments the ingredients as it should. Really good quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Too many choices IS a bad thing! I've been there a few times and I still don't get it. Yes, pick whatever you want, got it. But with so many decisions to make, I don't know if I'm making a good sandwich and messing up a good thing. So many different cards too, plus a separate card for a cookie too, haha. What a waste. Why not laminate it and use erasable markers and reuse the cards?

Anyways, my latest visit resulted in food poisoning, which is no claim you ever want to make. But, it was the only thing I ate that day and it hit shortly after I finished the meal (gone about 24 hours later). I've unfortunately had it before, and while it wasn't as extreme. I will not be returning EVER again. If you don't heed my warning, then make sure you avoid the French Dip. I think it was the meat, my friends say it has to be the au ju dipping sauce. Either way, consider me out!"}
{"text":"The Wife and I decided to give Which Wich a try since we were driving past and really like subs. We'll keep driving next time.

Overview (copied from their website): \"Guests use red Sharpies® to mark up pre-printed menus on sandwich bags. They select a sandwich from one of 10 categories, then choose the type of bread, size, cheese, spreads, and vegetables. The sandwiches are prepared to guests' exact specifications and delivered in personalized sandwich bags. After they've enjoyed their wiches, guests are encouraged to draw on their bags with the same red Sharpies and hang their 'artwork' on the community wall.\"

At first, this seemed like a cool concept, but we were quickly frustrated by the fact that, having just spent time deciding what we wanted to eat and marking that info on the bags, we then had to stand at the counter while an employee inputted each of our orders -- item by item -- into the system. It would have been much faster for us to just place our order at the counter in the first place, rather than repeating the process twice.

We waited nearly five minutes for our sandwiches, even though there was no line in the place. While I understand that time and care must be put into making sandwiches, I've been spoiled by places like Jimmy Johns and Potbelly where sandwiches are made quickly and taste great.

Which brings me to the taste of the sandwiches. Meh. I've experienced better. The bread was, at best, forgettable (the Wife hated it). The meat (pastrami) was overly salty, and the sauces lackluster.

Overall, to the question of \"Which Wich?\" I reply, \"Pretty much anyone else's!\""}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time today and it was awesome! I love the concept. I got cole slaw on my sandwich, totally delicious. 

I highly recommend this place for a quick bite to eat. 

Also the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Staff was more concerned with hanging out in the back and discussing (cursing) how to divide tips than with completing my order.  Apparently they also ran out of meat and change so the manager was away.  Really poor experience for a usually strong franchise.  I'll stick with other locations from now on I guess."}
{"text":"So I have been a customer since the Arrowhead location opened.  Always had great service and great food, until this past weekend. Called in an order, the employee was rude and having difficulty taking my order.  I had to repeat myself several times, while she tells me she's busy. When I got to the restaurant 10 min later, the cashier couldn't find my order.  Another employee came to the register and pulled the order bags from under the register, they hadn't been put in rotation or filled.  So I had to wait for them to make them. After 20 more minutes, I went to the pickup window looking for my order and the woman behind the counter found them on a shelf, already made.  Very rude, and really not that busy.  We won't go back, too many choices in the area to deal with poor service and sandwiches were not made correctly.
Too bad!"}
{"text":"Visited again tonight. Two years later, still disappointing. How is it possible to mess up a sandwich?! Come on!"}
{"text":"This is slowly becoming my favorite sandwich shop.  I don't have one in my town, so I look forward to trips here when I'm Huntersville.  The food is fresh and good, and the staff have always been nice and friendly.  I love the concept of filling out something that you hand in rather than standing over your \"sandwich artist\" and telling them what you want. 

Once they heated my sandwich when I wanted it cold.  I told them it was no problem, and the manager came and gave me a free sandwich coupon for the next time I came in. 

The only thing I don't like is the seating.  There's not enough, plus it's hard and not very comfortable.  Lots of high barstools and you feel you are on top of each other.  

I've had the grinder most here - it's great. Had the Surf and Turf today for a change and it was great too."}
{"text":"Decided to try Which Wich for the first time tonight and after seeing the reviews it seems worth it! As soon as we pulled up I noticed immediately it was dimly lit in the restaurant. Turns out the lights in the lobby are off. Hmm. We walked in and the was a woman behind the counter making food and while we were obviously confused on how to order, my boyfriend looks at her for help and she ignores him and walks in the back to grab another employee. He comes out and let's us know the bags to order are usually there. They weren't, and just told us to write our order on whatever bag we grab. We did so, paid $20 for two ultimate blts with swiss and one large drink and waited for a bit for our food. I noticed the trashes were full to the top and tables were a little messy for being empty. Not very inviting so we took our food togo. We get home and our bacon is cold but the sandwich itself was semi warm which was really weird... Bread wasnt toasted at all. Maybe I'm just used to subway? Anyway, it seems like the people working here were really just lazy it seems and uncaring.. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Food is really good. I really like the ordering style, I hate having to stand in line and order at a place like Subway b/c I am trying to hurry for the next person in line. They have a great variety so you can make the perfect sandwich for you. Great customer service at this particular store."}
{"text":"I had a free sandwich from here from my birthday. My daughter really enjoyed being able to check off what she wanted on her sandwich. It was pretty busy during the time we went, but we didn't have to wait longer than 5 minutes for her sandwich. The people working seemed nice. They spoke amongst themselves while making the food. Definitely plan on going back soon."}
{"text":"Im a fan of Jimmy Johns. It took just to long to get food, waited 15 min after we placed order our order.
The sandwich was OK nothing to write home about.
I think next time I will just drive by."}
{"text":"It's okay. There is really nothing that stands out about their sandwiches. Basic subs & I feel they are a bit pricey for the quality and taste of the sandwich."}
{"text":"For a quick sandwich this is the place to go.  The bread rolls used have texture and taste..... Not the stick to the roof of your mouth type bread. I always choose the corn beef.  It is not to salty, I wish ketchup was an option in their dressing section as this condiment goes so well with corn beef"}
{"text":"LOVE sandwiches and subs, but not here.  I feel concept is flawed - by the time you pick the bag (meat type), mark down all your options and give to the Cashier, you could have had everything accomplished at Subway.   I ordered the chicken pesto because I love pesto - also ordered the pesto sauce, red onion, etc.  Having eaten the whole thing, I have no idea why they called it that - tasted like dry tasteless chicken on a dry bun (for $11).  Disappointment in the sandwich was combined with length of time it took to order, pay and for them to make the sandwich - making it impossible as a 30-minute lunch break place!   I'm going back to Subway where it's fast and flavorful.  Too bad, was really hopeful."}
{"text":"Great quick and friendly service. The manager was willing to let me use the check in coupon even after I had paid for my sub which was cool. I like the variety of subs that are available and all the ones that I've tried have been pretty good."}
{"text":"They were very clean.  The staff were super friendly.  I got a huge sandwich and it was perfect.  They have double what other sandwich shops offer as toppings.  It was a super cool place and they were very efficient."}
{"text":"I am unhappy with the service that I received and lack of responding to my complaint after I advised corporate I was unhappy. 

Usually I get great food this time not so much. Stale bread. Incorrect sandwich fixings.  Tried to r solve at store level and nada. Emailed corporate and nada. I have the loyalty and the guy did not even add my phone number as I gave him for rewards."}
{"text":"Oh boy - the grinder Wich was yummy!!!  Good subs - wish I would have known about these sooner!!  Nice size - a bit pricey but good quality and flavor"}
{"text":"Not that great honestly... save your money and go to firehouse. Everything was wet and soggy."}
{"text":"Great addition to the area! North Scottsdale needs more quick and easy lunch places like Which Wich. 

We had lunch there a few days after it opened. The place was packed, but the manager helped move the line along by explaining how the ordering system worked. First, you select a brown paper bag based on what type of meat you want, then fill in the ingredients. Next, pay and hand the bag to the cashier. Finally, collect your sandwich at the end of the counter.

I ordered a turkey sandwich and had some of their homemade chips. Great sauce selection that includes A1, hummus, honey mustard and spicy ranch! There are three sizes: 7\", 10\", and 14\". The regular 7\" runs around $6, which includes cheese and all veggies (avocado costs extra). Not the best sandwich out there, but superior to the average sandwich chain. Will definitely make this a regular lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Which wich for the First time ever!!! 
Yes I look a little confused when I walked in , the manager was nice and show me how to order my food. You grab a brown bag and fill out your order. Cool ! I chose the Banh mi and wanted to substitute the pulled pork for chicken but they informed me that the seasoning it's already mixed in the meat. 
No big deal, I thought. 
While waiting for my wich, I'm impressed by the wall of art ! so that's what you're supposed to do at which wich ! Got it ! I will bring out my artistic skills next time I'm here! 
My Banh mi taste great, not your authentic Vietnamese banh mi but it's okay. Because it tastes good enough for a sandwich ! 
Fresh cilantro,cucumber and jalapeños! 
Pulled pork is packed with flavor! 
I can't wait to go back and try more sandwiches!!!"}
{"text":"Glad to see another Which Wich open in North Scottsdale. The chain relies on the novelty concept of using a red sharpie on a paper bag to order. This location has a few kinks to work out. I've been in a few times and it takes much longer to order than other Which Wichs in the Valley.

Things Which Wich does right: quality ingredients, well-made sandwiches, fun atmosphere. \"I'd like to sit and eat my sandwich here\" - said no Subway patron ever.

Get the loyalty cup (same price as large) and save on drink refills."}
{"text":"Ordered avocado sandwich yesterday the person who made it did a very great job the sandwich was sooo good I couldn't believe it. The little teens who work there have better customer service than a lot of adults I've encountered at other places."}
{"text":"So Which Which closes at 9:00 pm I went in at 8:20 and they were just as friendly as they had just opened. My family and I were greeted when we walked in the door. And then asked if we needed any help. 
       When you walk in there is a wall where you pick your sandwhich from. After you choose which one you want you choose the bag with the corresponding number. For example I choose a number 5 chicken sandwich so I picked up bag number five. On your bag there are options for your sandwhich you circle all the items you want on your sandwhich, as well as the size you want, and any sides you would like. Once finished you hand the bag to the cashier and once the sandwhich is done they call you by name to pick up your sandwhich.
       As far as the restaurant itself it was bright yellows a fun place to grab a quick bite to eat. The tables were clean and the whole place was in order. 
       The staff was friendly and helpful. They worked fast to get our order done and correct in a timely manner.
         The sandwhich was tasty. All the ingredients tasted fresh and the sandwhich was well put together. I would definitely go back to grab a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Unbelievably amazing vegetarian sandwich. Wheat - pesto - mozzarella - tomato - mayo - avocado. Baked to a crisp perfection, it melted into my soul via my mouth. Will be back."}
{"text":"I had a tough time convincing my friends to come with me to just another sandwich place - but I got them intrigued with the brown paper bag ordering system.  For my first visit, I went big - and ordered the Wicked Wich.  A sandwich that has FIVE meats and THREE cheeses.  Ridiculous - and delicious.

Since then, I've tasted many of their sandwiches and never been disappointed.  Don't forget to keep your receipt and get a coupon for a free cookie (which you get warm and gooey)"}
{"text":"Yes, another sandwich shop that can't do \"off the menu!\". Today's adventures included a chicken salad on sourdough hold the tomatoes.

Check out the picture as to what I actually got: ~ on walnut raisin bread with tomatoes.  Oh well."}
{"text":"Which Wich is probably one of the tastiest sandwich shops I've been to. There so many choices and options- it's worth a couple extra dollars to come here instead of a subway. It's also very vegetarian friendly :) only complaint was that the waiting time was a little lengthy, but worth it in the end."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good sandwich shop. Like other reviews, they do have a unique ordering process. You take a bag with your selections of meat and then tell them what toppings you want by marking the bag. Employees were friendly and the restaurant is clean. I've tried their turkey sandwich and their ham. Both quite good."}
{"text":"Love this place! The service is exceptional, and the sandwiches are fully customizable and tasty. I go around lunch time, and it is always crowded. Order online ahead of time or prepare yourself to wait. There was one instance where I arrived around lunch time and the place was packed. I placed my order and did not want to wait inside because there were so many people and little children running around. I let the cashier know I would be waiting outside. I waited for a while outside and a crew member came out and asked if I was waiting for a sandwich. I told him yes, and let him know my name and he brought it to me. The cashier is super busy so I understand she couldn't relay the message. I appreciate that another employee brought me my sandwich because I am not a fan of crowds. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Very inefficient and slow staff. Three staff only one making sandwiches while the other 2 walked around. The bread was fantastic the sandwich just OK. We purchased a small sandwich but we were overcharged  (for medium).  The cost was $27 for two small sandwiches, one small bag of chips and one medium Coke. Extremely overpriced for the value."}
{"text":"My first time here, had the chicken pesto with garlic and oregano on toasted wheat. Great sandwich!! I will be back"}
{"text":"No matter how semi-decent their sandwiches are, these people mistreat their workers. Don't support this chain. If you see a new employee there every time you visit it's because no one is willing to stick around. 

The owners are cheap and will do the bare minimum to pass the food safety tests, they've received failing reviews before. Ingredients are often missing from orders or barely there at all, and watch out for paper wrapping shreds in the meat.

Avoiding this place is simple as its surrounded by sandwich shops of better quality and better company. Jimmy Johns or potbelly will satisfy your craving and won't damage your conscious as I'm sure they treat their employees better."}
{"text":"Oh, Which Wich. I want so badly to love you.  You have a sandwich called \"The Elvis\" that includes peanut butter, banana, honey, and bacon - that alone should rocket you to a top spot in my heart. Alas...time and time again you fail me!!!

I cannot even count anymore how many issues we have had with Which Wich! There have been numerous sandwiches that have been made incorrectly (which is odd because it very clearly states on the bag exactly what we ordered!), it takes an exorbitant amount of time to make these sandwiches, and they are not cheap!! The last time I went, I called ahead, knowing it takes FOREVER to get your order. I arrived 12 minutes later to discover they hadn't even begun making my sandwiches yet - and it was not busy. The bananas for The Elvis were not ripe, so they offered to substitute jelly - I expected a plain PB&J (this was for my kids), but instead we got PBJ&H - because they kept the honey. One might think that honey would be good on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but then one would be mistaken. It was awful. Nobody would eat it. 

The one saving grace of Which Wich is that when they screw things up - they give you a free sandwich.  I've gotten four free sandwiches.  I appreciate that - I just wish they could be correct the first time!!"}
{"text":"This establishment overall is a great place to get awesome sandwiches!  
The only reason why it gets 4/5 stars is the woman who on TWO occasions was very unfriendly towards me and was very uncomfortable to observe while working with the other employees. She seemed to turn down the joyful mood every time I was in there. The employees appeared unhappy and stressed when she was there, which is unfortunate because I believe she might be a type of manager. 

Other than that experience, all the other visits have been great! One time it was raining outside and one of the employees offered to escort me to my car with this huge umbrella! It was very nice.  
My other great thing to say about the place is that an employee who had nice tattoo artwork was EXTREMELY accommodating, informational and friendly!  

In the end you will most definitely enjoy this food chain more than Jimmy Johns!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, but both times produced some pretty yummy sandwiches. Now don't let the confusing set up steer you away. It's really easy to figure it out. My second time i forgot how it works but i figured it out. Grab a bag that matches what you like off the big menu board. Fill it out, hand it to the cashier and pay. Easy! Last tome i was there an older man needed help figuring it out and one of the employees cane out to take him step by step. The subs are so great..fresh...flavorful! I had the grinder last time and stepped out the box and added the olive spread. It really made the sandwich! The place is always clean and never busy around dinner time!"}
{"text":"Saw Which wich in the news and since I didn't plan on using their bathroom decided to give them a try.  The place looked clean and the ordering station was easy to follow.  
Ordered a pepperoni pizzawich and overall it tastes really good.  While the marinara sauce was alright the bread and meat really made the sandwich.  It might sound like I'm knocking the sauce but overall it added to the enjoyment of the meal.  
I will definitely come back and try something different.  Which wich is a huge improvement over a place like subway. It was a bit pricier but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Yummy as usual. I told you last time I was a big fan and have been probably 6 or 7 times and each time was as good as the last. I took my niece today and she had a thrill writing her name as Wonder Woman and the staff called it out when her order was ready tickling her pink."}
{"text":"Understaffed - and the staff that does work here-is rude. Waited 37min for a sandwich that I clearly labeled \"cold!!\" (Because for whatever reason every sandwich they make is hot now...wth) and it was still make wrong.  As I was waiting, three other sandwiches were made incorrectly.  Sandwiches were also out of order and orders were being split apart forcing families to eat separately or wait and then eat a soggy sandwich. Train the staff better and don't hire rude high schoolers who would rather spit in your food just as soon as make it correctly.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Which which which is the best?  All of them. After discovering the thank you turkey in Lone Tree, CO, I continue to go to which which in Scottsdale. While the thank you turkey sandwhich is still my favorite and may even rival the Bobbie at Cappriotti's, the Reuben rocks!  

The chocolate malt is also great and the staff putts up with me putting fake names on my sandwich bag. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I have been here now twice in the last 3 weeks when they have not had white bread and have to change to my order. Decent sandwich but how do you not have white bread at 7pm on a Tuesday or Thursday? Service is also very slow, usually at least a 15 minute wait after ordering."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are here are way better than the subs you get in subway. There are many varieties of toppings and dressings they have to offer and the prices are quite decent here. Lastly i would recommend the wicked sandwich here as it is one of the best subs I have had at a cheap price."}
{"text":"Better than your average subway and I love that they have alternative options for a low carb, keto or healthier diet. 
Let me give you a little background as I had only been to one of these for sandwiches in California before I moved to sunny AZ.  First you pick a brown bag with the basic type of sandwich meat. You can get pork, chicken, beef, cold cuts, crab meat salad- anything you'd want. Then you mark the size of your sandwich, cheese and veggie toppings to your hearts desire. It's all reasonably priced from about $7-$10 and the sandwiches are toasted and treated with care. I also always get excellent customer service when I go. They also bake their own fresh cookies, which you can get as an ice cream cookie sandwich, and rice krispie treats too!
They have cool specialty sandwiches like the monte christo, or the surf n turf (roast beef with crab salad) which are worth a try if you are feeling particularly adventurous.

My favorite part though is that you can get it as a lettuce wrap sandwich or salad bowl for $7. a gyro lettuce wrap with tzatziki will really hit the spot when your cravin some greek :)"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are delicious, and staff is friendly and helpful.  Visited this place for the first time tonight, and will definitely be back.  They may still be getting their bearings, but give 'em a chance.  Potato chips *on* my sandwich??  Hell yes!  Pro tip: leave a tip.  And not just, like, a small handful of pennies, you guys.  If you can afford Uggs and Ray-Bans, you can afford to leave a tip.  For real."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cool and I love the style. When you walk in you pick a bag which contains what mean you want or vegetarian. Then on the bag you fill in the circles to what you want in the sandwich. They have many options and the food quality is great. I went to the one location on mill ave in Tempe and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. If you're looking for a good sandwich, come here."}
{"text":"I like the idea of interacting the least amount possible when ordering food and this place has it down to a science. You walk in, look at the menu, choose the bag that corresponds with your sandwich, pick your toppings and hand it to the cashier. Done. They make your sandwich and you're on your way. I had the turkey with cole slaw and thousand island dressing. It was ok. The bread wasn't my favorite. It was crusty and didn't feel fresh. The turkey was very salty. Not sure if I'll try them again on my own but would be willing to try another sandwich if someone wanted to take me there:)"}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood, Which Wich! Just around the corner from where I work...ideal for a quick break and good food. Pretty fun concept...grab a sharpie (I love sharpies), grab a bag, mark your selections...and wha-la, a tasty sandwich made to order!

They have so much to choose from...even pizzas (haven't tried those yet). They even make shakes, which are very delicious! You could probably eat here every day and get something different each time. Like others have mentioned, they have so many selections. Your kiddos can even join the sharpie fun. They have a baggie selection just for kids too!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The ordering process is a little odd but once you get used to it, it's not bad. Sometimes there's a backup waiting to get a pin and bag to mark your orders. You can order your sandwich \"skinny\" (less bread) or as a salad. I normally don't like chips but I do like their house made salt and pepper chips. 

Ingredients are fresh and you can have them make it with exactly the ingredients you want in it. One star down because there's a couple items that typically come with onion. I write in big letters NO ONION and tell the cashier. They only see it about 1/2 the time. Very frustrating when ordering to go and don't see until I don't see it until I get home. Also because typically chicken is my favorite meat. Theirs is Ho-hum. Not sure why but it seems to lack flavor."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place, but am sadly not very happy with my first visit.

I saw an advertisement for their Bánh mì sub, and was expecting something pretty simple and delicious. But what they handed over was pretty terrible. The sub was only slightly warm, like they barely ran it through the little heating unit. Cold pulled-pork is never a very pleasant thing to eat. All the other ingredients just kind of fought each other. And the bread wasn't very good either. 

I didn't expect this to very closely replicate a great (authentic) Bánh mì sandwich, but this was a disaster.

I was also frustrated with the price. I wasn't asked what size I wanted and the sandwich rang up at over $8, which is a crazy amount for a medium sub!

The staff members working were pretty friendly, but not overly helpful or outgoing. When I said it was my first visit, they should have offered some suggestions maybe? They didn't even try to upsell me anything!

I may go back and give them a second chance, but I just threw half of my first sandwich in the trash. Which wich? Not that one. Yuck."}
{"text":"Consistently decent sandwiches and consistently shotty service, at least at this location. If you've eaten at one Which Wich, you've eaten at them all. Nothing spectacular or noteworthy. 

My quick sandwich pickup the other day turned into a 40 minutes ordeal because they misplaced my bag. I wasn't comped at all except for getting a \"my bad, man\". 

Their online orders have completely taken priority and diluted the in-store ordering experience. They need to find the right balance and throttle back the online orders by increasing the wait time on them (for example)."}
{"text":"I do have to say Which Which can make a pretty decent sandwich and like the fact that you get to choose everything that goes on that sandwich and prices are pretty spot on for what you get. But service here is slacking only word I heard the entire transaction was \"$12.54\" not a word more."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean, staff were friendly, and the process was simple, even for a first-timer like myself. This part of the shopping center has ample parking. I'm grateful they have vegan and vegetarian options, too. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Have been waiting 29 minutes past when my online order was supposed be ready. There's 3 others in the entire place so I don't think they could be backed up. Have encountered this many times before, very frustrating!!"}
{"text":"Which Wich is my favorite sandwich shop, and this location is a great one.  They worked quickly and the location was clean.  The food was delicious as expected.  Also, being able to get a free bag of chips with my sandwich because I checked in was a huge plus."}
{"text":"Great sandwich with fresh ingredients! I couldn't believe all the choices they give you. 

I was like a kid in a candy store...I LOVE a good sandwich! The service was great as well. We will be back"}
{"text":"I have been somewhat flummoxed over how to rate Which Wich.

I believe Which Wich does a nice job making a pricey average sandwich in a quirky feeling store (see photo of the Arrows).

We have been here several times and came yesterday after receiving a coupon by email for a free Regular (Small). My friend used my punch card for a free tenth one.  What that means is that they credit your bill for $5.50.

We both ordered the brown, thinly sliced roast beef. Which Wich defines their sizes as Regular 7\", Large 10\" and Super 14\" You have the option of adding various veggies, or toasting it a la Quiznos. Like Quiznos, Which Wich weights how much meat you get and I would imagine that Regular has about 3 ounces. 

It's only a guess on my part since there is a five foot wall separating you and the person preparing your sandwich.  Why would you not want me to see how you are preparing my sandwich?

My friend's sandwich didn't weight that much when I picked it up.  I ordered the Large 10\" (photo) with double meat (a $3.00 up charge). It felt like what a regular would feel like at Jimmy Johns or Jersey Mikes.  So you are paying $5.50 for a 7\" sandwich which has about the same meat that Subway puts on their $3.00 six inch.  Yep I know, it's not really a 6 inches.  

In summary, that's $8.50 for a sandwich which would be $5.95 at Jimmy Johns, or $6.95 at Jersey Mike's (all prices do not include taxes).  Good thing they were comping me $5.50. LOL

My suggestion...  drive a little further down FLW to get a better sandwich and a better deal. Sorry."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location once a week for a couple of years now.  Until recently everything has always been great.  I went for lunch today (1:30pm) and was the only person in line.  I was thinking I'll have my food and be out of here in no time.  After ordering, I sat down to wait.  I watched the next 7 people that came into the restaurant, order and get their food while I sat and waited. One gentleman even finished eating his lunch.  After about 15 minutes, I asked about my lunch and was told we are working on it.  I got it about 5 minutes later without even a \"sorry for the wait\".  Not sure if I'll go back."}
{"text":"The Wich, is still Three Stars.  See my previous review if you want more details. 

The food is still fresh and their unique funkiness is still here. Grab a bag and marker, and have at it. 

But after reading Joyce W's review, I realize how we must have been separated at birth by different mothers. LOL. I agree with her that the sandwich is really good, but at a hefty price. 

You see my receipt today reads $10.64, after a $3.00 Off Online Discount. That's almost $14 for a 10\" medium sub!  \"Say what Willis?\" Last week, when we ate in Firehouse, their prices were almost the same.

Sooooo, go to JJs for the bread, or Potbelly's for the meat and toppings as Lindsay H has noted. I'll stop in here on pay days. 

And BTW, why aren't there any Potbellies south of Rio Salado? D'oh!"}
{"text":"Slowest thing ever!!! Although, we came with a big group, it took them 45 minutes to make my sandwich! Our sandwich places seem to be able to deal with our group. Get your sh*t together!"}
{"text":"The Brits have an expression, \"Smart by half.' 

I was driving up Scottsdale Road and noticed this new location. I have been on Which Wich's mailing list for a while and remember getting a \"Reverse Happy Hour buy one, get one free offer through August 15th\" email .

I ordered two medium turkey sandwiches, with extra meat ($3.00 up charge) and a soda.  My thinking was that one would be free and the bill would be around $10.00 or so.  Instead I was told it would be $19.16. Seems the offer reads \"order any regular size Wich and get the second Wich free\".  Silly me.

The two mediums weighted almost two pounds each.  They felt really, really heavy.  I was impressed. But without that credit, it would have been nearly $27 for those two subs and one drink. Wow

So yesterday I thought I would try the same exercise, but with two \"Regular\" sized sandwiches.  Without ordering a drink, my bill came to $6.41 and the two subs combined weight barely a pound.

At this point I'm giving up on comparison tests. I'll be sticking to Jimmy Johns or Jersey Mike's.  BTW, both places were empty and it took nearly ten minutes to get my order. So maybe, \"Subs, So Slow You'll Freak?\" LOL

Sorry, Two Stars and  \"Meh. I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced.  My toasted sandwich was hard and it did not have very much ham on it for the price.  Our sandwich orders were not correct and it took over 20 mins for them to make 3 sandwiches.  They had about 4 people working on making the sandwiches and they weren't busy, so I don't know what took so long.  We also ordered a couple of shakes.  It cost 50 cents extra to have one with banana.  The food comes up as they make it.  So, if you are in a group, you don't get it at the same time.  The drinks and sandwiches just come out randomly.  Sometimes they called out our name, sometimes they didn't.  Our second shake sat on the counter for awhile.  I finally went up to the counter and just took the shake.  The few people in the restaurant looked annoyed waiting for their orders.  

The only positive was the the friendly person that greeted us when we came in and explained how to order a sandwich."}
{"text":"I first tried these sandwiches several months back. Since then have returned several times to try different ones and to bring family members with me. 

I agree with some of the reviews - the ordering process can be a bit confusing - but its not that bad - and lets you customize your sandwich which is great. I can be a bit repetitive when you pay, but I'm ok with that. It does take a bit longer to get your sub, the first time I went I didn't allow enough time before my appointment and ended up taking the sandwich with me. 

The best part is - the taste. SO yummy. Probably my favorite sandwich place in town. The bread is delicious and I've tried 3-4 different subs and they've all been pretty damn good. Get a free cookie when you return if you fill out their survey online. Cookie is warm and super gooey good.

I'd give it 5 stars but my two complaints is that its too far from where I work and live - and the place is a bit small and can be crowded while you wait for your sub. But that's because they are so good."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to go for delicious sandwiches! My husband and I recently moved to an area close to this location and visit Which Wich quite often. We love the friendly service, delicious sandwiches, menu variety, and cleanliness of the restaurant, and have never been disappointed. We love how you can fill out your choices on the sandwich bag, and all of the options that are available. They also make an Oreo milk shake that is nothing short of amazing! And we really like that they offer a punch card reward system so we can earn our way to free subs. Love this place, and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love which which, and this location is nice friendly and clean. Jake is great! Greets you the moment you walk in with energy and smile and takes care of you, kindly with a great professional attitude. Make sure you keep him around!"}
{"text":"It took them forever to make my sandwich. It was ok but not the best quality meat. The set up and process to order is cute and a fun experience but the food itself was a little overpriced for what you get as well. I would look at it as a lower on the list sandwich stop."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich places in the area.  Between this or subway --hands down which which. 

Avoiding the lines during peak hours (1130-130) might save you some frustration otherwise pick your sandwich (brown bag) select the options with the red pen and pay.  Voila...  it will be ready in under 10 mins.

The house chips aren't really that great and generally opt for a meal without them.  Salads are a great option as well

Plus they offer a free sub every 10 you purchase.   I've had several free subs over the years :-)"}
{"text":"Holy turkey sandwich. Of all the generic sandwich shops there are this one takes the cake. Let me break in down like a shot gun for you.  In my case it is the best bang for your bucks. The turkey taste like it was just shot in the fields of Madagascar and cooked in a smoke pit of smoldering goodness. Then sliced and put on your sandwich with the precision of a ninja.  The lettuce was as crisp as a new $20 bill. With the freshness of a early 90s will smith song. The bread was delightful and warm just like the apple pie in American pie 1(the other ones sucked movies not food). But by far the chocolate milkshakes are to die for. With chocolate as rich as Donald Trump himself. The bold smooth creaminess delivers a taste to your month kind of like a Sean Spicer press conferences. It will leave you in disbelief. But oddly wanting more. Besides this place has all black ceilings big win in my book. Some helpful tips sometimes the service can take a while. But has gotten better lately."}
{"text":"Went there over lunch hour and the place was a circus. Place was high energy level and busy which was kind of neat cause it made you feel like you were in a bigger city where everything is more fast paced. The works get a 5 rating they were very friendly. If you come in during lunch hour, forget about dining in though. Very few tables and people waiting for to go orders will be all over you. Food was good. Lots of options and variety compared to the stand sub shops."}
{"text":"The only thing i dont like about this place are the eiffel tower stools. Im waiting, patiently, for one of them to break and someone comically crashes to the floor, sandwich guts becoming airborne. I stay in the safer chairs....
Food has been delicious every time. The staff are very friendly an quick!!!"}
{"text":"A little pricey for what they offer but they have a lot of options which which (intentional) is nice. A step above the other build your own sandwiches place with some healthier varieties. 

Not food related but they're seating is very weird and not meant for you to hang out and chit chat for a while as they are REALLY uncomfortable chairs!"}
{"text":"I tried Which Wich after seeing them in the shopping center with Total Wine.  I signed up for their email list, and they emailed me a coupon for a free sandwich during the week of my b-day.  I looked at the reviews and the website, so I knew about the ordering process.  You take a bag, mark what you want on with a Sharpie, and give it to the cashier.  They then make your sandwich and put in said bag.  It's a fun process, although I'm not crazy about community Sharpie's.  However, there is a lot of hand sanitizer, plus clean restrooms.  The sanitation grade is 101.

The free sandwich was for the 7\", but they now offer 10\" and 14\".  I upgraded to the 10\" and paid the difference.  The sandwich was good and I loved the toasted white bread without the whole sandwich being toasted.  Although I was expecting grilled chicken, it was lunch meat but good quality lunch meat.  They are a little skimpy with the toppings.  My wife order tomato and avocado (that is what the sandwich is called) but there was no avocado on it.

The quality here is better than Subway but not as good as Jersey Mike's. The prices are similar to JM's, so if paying full price, I'd rather go there, but I won't rule out or be oppossed to Which Wich."}
{"text":"I would give a review of the food, but they closed 10 minutes early.   When we showed up at 5 minutes to 9 pm they were locked up and had already cleaned the dining area.  When I motioned to my wrist signaling the time was not 9 yet, the employee just shrugged and turned away.  Went to eat next door and was told by neighboring restaurant that \"they always close early\"."}
{"text":"This is a great sandwich shop, the staff are nice, the food is customizable and yummy. The price is right and there's a free membership perks program."}
{"text":"Overall my experience at which wich was meh. I came in on a Sunday there where a few people in line nut not many. 

I'm mainly disappointed at the quality of the deli meat which was very salty and much resembled typical cheap processed deli meat. Even worse, the price did not reflect the quality at all. 8.25 for a 10\" is a good price when the deli meat is high quality but not for whatever they are using. 

The service was meh as well. Maybe they all had the Sunday blues but other then the cashier who was pleasant and actually smiled ( I think his name was Andrew), no one even really made an effort to be happy or go out of their way. My wich had cucumbers in it which I am willing to write off as an honest mistake. I asked for a side of pesto as there wasn't very much on my wich and received a small, less then half full Togo sauce container.  It was enough for one half of one side. The employee never smiled once. 

Overall, had the meat been better it would have been pretty decent. The bread was ok but a little dry when toasted. I won't come back though simply because of the price and awful quality of meat."}
{"text":"the food was good but the lady there was a straight B**** . Super rude and when I told her that i didn't want the raw egg on my sandwich she said \"Good I'll eat it, I haven't had breakfast\" and removed it. I guess that's a good Way to not let food go to waste. But the way she said it, she had an attitude. I've heard great things about Which Wich but coming to this location was a pretty bad experience"}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches at Which Wich and the ingredients really taste like they use some of the best.  Milkshakes are also a step above and always delicious.  The thing that gets me about this location is that they close fairly early.  I know this isn't NYC or anything, but it seems any restaurant around here should regularly be open until at least 9PM."}
{"text":"Decent subs (better than subway and the like), but the place is always crowded and feels too expensive for what you get. It was my first time at a which wich but I'm honestly thinking it'll be my only time there. I can spend the same amount elsewhere and get more food."}
{"text":"I'm doing keto Diet (high fat low carb) and I miss Italians subs so I come here and get the lettuce wich and have them warm just the meat and cheese IT IS SO GOOD such a great place with awesome people who work here"}
{"text":"I decided to give \"Which Wich\" a try last week as I was out shopping about. Once I entered the establishment, a young lady could tell I was trying to figure out what to do, and immediately guided me through the ordering process. They have a variety of different sandwich types. Each type of sandwich has a bag. After you choose the type of sandwich you would like, you then circle which accompaniments you would like on the matching bag. They had a very nice variety for the turkey sandwich. I chose whole wheat bread, lettuce, tomato, red onion, green peppers, jalapenos, and avocado. There is an additional charge for avocado but I don't remember exactly how much. The total was approximately 5.50. I'd say overall, \"Which Wich\" is a bit nicer than Subway with fresher ingredients, a bigger selection, and wider variety of accompaniments.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area and have a hankering for a sub!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Since they have so many different choices and it's 100% custom to order it's great for a picky eater or to satisfy the whole family.  

I got a turkey sub, my husband got the buffalo chicken.  We both really enjoyed them.  I just wish I had gotten the hot peppers on the side, holy cow were they ever HOT!  It's really close to home and convenient so we will be back!"}
{"text":"As far as sandwich chains go, Which Wich stands out. I love that you can decide what kind of sandwich and toppings you want at your leisure without any rush. The prices run around the same as Quizno's. The variety of meats and toppings are excellent as is the quality. Tried the Surf and Turf sandwich, a risky sandwich that I would never order at a place like Subway, even if they offered it. But at Which Wich, the meat is fresh, the lettuce is crisp, and the bread isn't hard. A pretty good lunch."}
{"text":"I won't discuss their unique ordering process as its already been mentioned, I'll cut to the chase. Their variety of ingredients is superb, consisting of everything from popcorn shrimp and crab salad to bbq pork. They also have numerous toppings and dressings, however their only breads consist of white or wheat bread. Which Wichs  sandwiches are akin to Jimmy John's or a higher quality Subway more so than Quiznos or Jasons. Portion sizes are generous, and whenever I order several toppings, they don't sacrifice quantity, it ends up just being a huge sandwich. As others have said, they are a little slow, but quick enough to be in and out in under thirty minutes. The milkshakes are solid too, not bad for this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Holy cow!!! That was an amazing sandwich!!! You knocked my socks off! I just had a turkeywich with shoestring onions and ate the whole thing and then wanted to go get another one. Yum"}
{"text":"I arrived by bike and although the Yelp info indicates that there is bike parking, that was not the case. There are no bike racks, or anything else to lock up to except for the handicapped parking signs, which could block access for those using it. I even asked a person working there, in case the bike parking was hidden out by the dumpsters like some places do, but he confirmed that there is no bike parking. 

Sandwich was tasty and service was good. Sadly, I won't be back because they have no where for me to lock my bike, which stinks because this is an easy 3 minute bike ride from my office, and would otherwise have become a regular go to for lunch. It is also right across the street from a bike path, which would really work in their favor with the simple addition of a bike parking."}
{"text":"I have heard so many things about which wich from coworkers and never really been to one until now. I wanted to know what the hype was. I went inside the store and was immediately helped and shown that you pick out your bag and write what you want. I got the chicken cordon bleu wrap. I tried it and it was okay. I honestly couldn't really taste much of the chicken or ham. Maybe I drowned it with too many ingredients? I still scarfed it down because I was hungry but am thinking next time I'll try something else off the menu."}
{"text":"Still a great spot to grab a bite to eat. Even though the kids meal states a token is included for the kid, both times we've been in.. .it isn't included.  No biggie to me, huge deal to my 6 year old. Haha kids
Also menu has changed,  bummed no Elvis sandwich anymore,  not even available to make...since no bananas.  Bummed. 
Tried the ultimate BLT, it was decent. No where as amazing as the pb&banana And bacon  Elvis one."}
{"text":"I waited over a half an hour to get my sandwich after ordering, I knew it would be a wait going during lunch on a weekday. It's worth the wait if you have the time!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and their staff always makes me smile. I love this place. One of the best sub shops around and it's not my the food that makes it that way. It's the people"}
{"text":"First time to which wich... no one greeted us as we entered... and being our first time here we would have walked out not knowing what to do except for our friend was with us and she had been there before.  There is a menu on the wall and paper bags and pens on a table to write the menu items  that you choose.  Fun idea but for new customers there needs to be some customer service! The food was good and the restaurant was clean...4 sandwiches and 3 teas $37 a little pricey for no table service... but a cute little sandwich shop. The place was empty, yet there was no interaction... No smiles or thank you as when we came in or as we left...  probably would not return due to the nonchalant attitude."}
{"text":"Shop closed 20 minutes early to \"change menu\". Shouldn't they do that after working hours? It was to be my first experience, turns out it's my last. Customer service starts with serving your customer during posted hours. Doesn't seem like too much to ask for."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan and supporter of Which Wich... however today was not an experience I would ever recommend to anyone else.  Not only did I get just a drop of Ranch Dressing for my side of ranch.. but my Buffalo Chicken Sandwich came as... Buffalo Turkey?  How do you confuse the two?  Not to mention, there isn't any buffalo sauce on it. Completely disappointed."}
{"text":"I love which-wich, and I drive 20 minutes each way to visit on my lunch, which doesn't leave very much time to eat once I return to my desk, but I love it so I make the trip. Today I came in and got the same sandwich turkey with bacon, only to sit down at my desk to find there was no bacon on the sandwich, which is very disappointing. Compounded by the fact I have absolutely no time to make a return trip to have it corrected nor should I have to. I visited the store at 1600 E Woodlawn in Charlotte, NC."}
{"text":"It's simple really, think about it... if the meat is of decent quality, the ingredients are fresh and the bread is toasted , it's hard to make a bad sub sandwich whether it be from Which Wich, Subway, or heck, even Harris Teeter Deli. It all comes down to preparation and execution. Everything else is just a another wrapper, which is, by the way, what Which Wich is... another rendition of a concept that was perfected in its simplicity, many years ago, by Subway (but let's face it, aren't we all a little tired of Subway?) 

This was my first encounter with Which Wich. I only went because a friend invited me. This location is sunny and appealing. Ordering is somewhat confusing but really shouldn't be. As you enter, the menu is on the wall to the left. You write your order on the provided paper bag and give it to the staffer directly ahead. The problem is, we have been conditioned to look straight ahead when we walk in a restaurant, and yes menu location, as conspicuous as it may be, can be a little confusing to first timers. No big deal though. I can look past it.

The main thing of course is the sandwich itself, and I joined my vegetarian friend in ordering the black bean patty 10.5 inch on toasted whole grain loaded with other healthy stuff. And it was... drum roll please... good! 

The service was okay. The staff was mainly teenagers that were somewhat disinterested (which unless you're at Chick-fil-A, that appears to be the norm). The place was clean and had a 97 sanitary rating. A big perk for me me is the crushed ice served with the fountain drinks, which more than anything, may hint at my age.

Overall, that's a lot of writing for an average restaurant. Oh I'll go back probably but the thought doesn't excite me. It's three stars at best."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and whoa was it busy! I arrived around 12:30 and headed towards the bag area. I decided to go with the turkey bacon ranch with lettuce, tomato and cucumber. I checked out right away then got into a line to wait for my name to be called. There were about 20-30 people ahead of me. 

They were full on staff and the wait line seemed to be going pretty fast. I didn't get my sandwich toasted and that's what seemed to be the cause of the hold up. I waited probably 7/10 minutes for my sandwich so if you're in a rush, I would avoid coming here. 

My sandwich was delicious though with plenty of meat and toppings- plus it was free because I had a birthday reward to use. Score! 

Overall if you don't like waiting and want to enjoy a variety of different choices (you could come here everyday for a month and have something different) then this is a good pick for you."}
{"text":"I feel so cool like when I stop by Which Wich for lunch these days! Grab a sharpie, and mark down whatever you like, then hand your baggie over to the cashier and magically it comes back filled with your sandwich!

I really like this place, it's fast, easy, and cheap. Also much more fun than the Jason's Deli next door! The only thing I don't like? How cold the place feels. I remember thinking while I was ordering once for such an fun concept the interior designer sure did an awful job of conveying that sense of fun into the space. Nevertheless Which Wich fills my lunchtime sandwich cravings quite nicely with their huge assortment of toppings, and fillings, and everything else in between!

P.S. Adding avocado really does make everything taste better!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of being able to customize your sandwiches/salads to your own preference. I also love that there is such an extensive list of toppings to choose from, such as: types of mayo, types of dressings, sauces, veggies, cheese, 3 types of onions, different spreads-like hummus and they even offer sprouts, not many places have this!

I got the small size (5inch) and I thought it was the perfect size. The meat & cheese ratio was sufficient also. I also liked that the bread was not too thick and doughy. I'm not sure why people are commenting that it was too small. I thought it was the perfect size. The price was affordable also- $5.50 for the small.

I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Very strange concept, I assume they are trying to be different.  Still strange. 
The food is below average although priced like its a 5 star restaurant. 
The location leaves a bit to be desired but I understand they chose it because of the view from the street. 
When did it become normal for a sandwich to be $10+, really lacked any flavor. 
Only reason I would go back is if I was so starving and every other food establishment close by was closed."}
{"text":"Awesome milkshakes!! Very creamy. Love their sandwiches! Wide selection and most of then taste pretty good"}
{"text":"We don't do \"quick\" meals often. However the one time we stopped in here we were really pleased. The customer service was excellent. From the moment we walked in to the point of where they offered us an extra bag for a box of muffins we had bought next door. Super friendly staff that engaged with their customers. Our sandwiches were yummy and it will be a place we return to on those rare occasions we look for something quick and easy. Way better then a subway or jimmy johns. Etc."}
{"text":"I just visited and I specifically told the woman it was my first time there.  Maybe she didn't hear me.  I thought the whole take a bag and check off what you want is strange.  I'm from the East Coast so I have never seen this concept before.  The option I chose was Grinder.  I didn't realize I needed to check off every single ingredient that comes with the grinder (lettuce, tomatoes, onions). Back east it comes with all that without having to specifically ask for it.  Needless to say I got home and my sandwich had none of that in there smh.....maybe I should have paid closer attention, I get it.  But when I'm looking for a $5 sub, it shouldn't be that difficult.  If I say I haven't been there I feel like she could have said \"let me explain the way this works \".   Or if she read the paper and saw I ordered a grinder, but she didn't see any vegetables checked off, she might have said \"hey did you want any of this on your sandwich?\"  I've been in town 1 week and coming from back east restaurants go that extra mile for customer service.  The sandwich and service was a big disappointment"}
{"text":"Being a northerner, I've never heard of which wich, but now that I have, I sure wish we had some in Chicago! The sandwiches & ingredients always look and taste super fresh, which I love. We've tried this place a few times & I haven't gotten a bad sandwich yet! I'm particularly fond of the club though."}
{"text":"It's a great sandwich, not much more to say here.  I usually go with the Italian style subs but the turkey and hams are pretty darn good as well.  I like to mix up my non cook lazy sandwich nights between here, jimmy johns, potbelly, and subway.  For $20-25 it allows me and my wife to not have to cook and goes well with a glass of wine at home.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"It would be 5 stars but... both orders were messed up. The food was actually really good and I was shocked to be honest. One thing was not good and it will be mentioned below. 

The order was placed online. At first they only gave him one of the two sandwichs so he had to go back in and get the 2nd order. 

First order was a small Wicked and he really liked it but it was missing 2 items that was requested on the sandwich. He said that would have really made it better. He really liked the bread and thought the portions of ingrediants were great. He got a choclate chip cookie as well and said it was great also. 

My order was the club and it was alot better than any other shop (subway etc.). It was also missing items on the sandwich but nothing that really took away from it. The portion of ham was great, turkey was ok, and bacon was kind of sad. Ingredients tasted great though, seemed fresh and the wheat bread was great. 

Now whatever they consider the house chips was just terrible. Soggy, stale, and/or both. Just nasty. I am not letting this take away from the sandwich I will just never get those again. 

The price was a little more than other places but I would eat there again and give them another chance. Seemed more like employee error and not a food issue. 

Give them a shot if you are in the mood for a sandwich!"}
{"text":"A little confusing for the first trip, but nice after you figure out the ordering system. Been here twice so far. Sandwiches are good.  Definitely try the brownie if you like sweets."}
{"text":"I will always love which wich but this location is super slow. There were 3 ladies working and no line when I walked in. I placed my order then realized that no one that was seated had thier food. I guess they were waiting for a bunch of bags to start making any of them. 15 minutes later I got my wich. It was amazing but too long for the situation."}
{"text":"Always love WhichWich!!! Its a little slow here but that's to be expected. They have been nothing but friendly and nice every time I have been in."}
{"text":"Love this location, all the employees always has a smile on there face.. good price for premium sandwiches. Quality bread, meat, and preparation. 

Just tried a Gyro and I'm quite surprised the quality given not being a Greek establishment. 

Good place for lunch! Or a really good sandwich."}
{"text":"You order by writing on sandwich bag. I ordered ultimate BLT but with mayo, not Chipotle mayo.  Nothing special about sandwich- tastes like any other you make at home. Sourdough bread was over toasted and was a -itch to eat; my mouth is all torn up from it now. This was my first visit. Normal waiting time. Order ahead you get $3 off. Sign up for emails you get free large drink."}
{"text":"The first strike was I earned a free sandwich. I filled out the bag for a grinder and gave it to them and they said oh no you can't order that sandwich that's a premier sandwich and you have to order a basic sandwich. Mind you I was ordering grinders in the first place. I swore them off for at least a year after being a loyal customer. I gave them a second chance, I ordered an egg salad sandwich, I filled out the bag gave it to them and they told me that \"we don't have egg salad today\", it wasn't that big of a deal but I had to fill out another bag, so I gave them another shot. Today I went in and they were way understaffed on the busiest night of the year which was the premiere of Star Wars. They only had two people working behind the counter and cash register, It took forever to get our sandwiches which was OK for us because we were early for the movie anyway. A lot of people came in, waited and left, they looked frustrated. I don't blame the people working there because they were really working hard to keep up, I blame the management. They need to focus more on the customer then on themselves. They have great sandwiches but they always fall short on customer service."}
{"text":"I usually love the salads here but tonight it was....bad. The teenagers were so busy giggling and fooling around they could hardly get orders out. 
I ordered a chicken salad. It tasted like an entire shaker of salt had been put into it. Also, I paid extra for sliced egg and did not get it. I didn't dare mention to the employees because who knows what I would have gotten next.
Bad.
Go next door to sweet tomatoes, that's my recommendation."}
{"text":"Really? I get it, I'm a grown adult ordering a grilled cheese, but $8 for two pieces of sandwich bread and a slice of American cheese??? Why couldn't you just charge me the $5.25 for a kid's meal, which includes the EXACT sandwich I ordered, veggies, and a drink??? Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I like Which Wich. Once I realized that the key to their sandwiches are to get them 'hot' I've never looked back. Imagine my excitement when this location opened up close to home.

So why 2 stars?

This location has a 'quirk' that I hope, if pointed out, might be fixed. If it's fixed I'd gladly give it more stars. The quirk is that the employees are more interested in their 'conversation' than in pumping out consistent product. Let me explain - the last 3 times I've visited this location resulted in an incorrect order. One time I wrote \"extra\" next to mayonnaise and I got no mayonnaise. Another time I ordered a roast beef and received a turkey sub. Another time I ordered online to pick up at 5:30 and I arrived at 5:20 only to find my entire order in a bag and ready to go - what? Was their plan to have it sit there for 10 minutes?

So what's the deal? The deal is that the staff is having their little party and the orders are only interruptions - they aren't paying attention.

It's simply - get the orders right. Then all will be fine."}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times, I walked away thinking this is the best sandwich I've ever had. The staff is friendly and the subs are excellent. Plenty of variety and spice so I got the tailor made masterpiece I wanted.."}
{"text":"I went there the first time the other day.  They made lunch an adventure.  Their method of ordering was very different and made it fun to figure out something new.  The down side is that there are so many options, I want it all and likely spent more than I needed.

The food was really really good.  This includes their milk shake.  Very pleased, and excited to share with my wife next time."}
{"text":"Like a couple other reviewers, I placed an online order which ended up being a disaster. The online ordering part was easy peasy, but when I went to the store to pick up my sandwich they didn't have it made because their online system wasn't working. I was informed of this about 5 min after telling my name and that I was there to pick up my order. Then I had to wait an additional 15 min for them to figure it out and finally make my sandwich. They did offer me a drink while I waited and apologized for the wait.

My lunch break is only  30 min so I rushed back not checking my food to make sure it was correct. I got back to work only to discover that it was the wrong sandwich! 

I called to let them know I got the wrong order and the guy was very nice and told me I could come back and get a new sandwich. I ended up going after work and they remade it. 

This was my first time at any Which Which. I understand technology doesn't always work, but it's still irritating to go through so much for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Went here for a second time last night and didn't stray far from my first visit. Wheat bread, buffalo chicken, pepper jack cheese, jalapenos, ranch, buffalo sauce and lettuce. Apparently i like it, cause i'm thinking i will stick with that and maybe add something here and there until i find the perfect variation. 
Seems to be a ton of choices overall. My mom tried the tuna melt type thing and seemed satisfied saying \"I'd get this again.\" 

And the wife was right, i don't know why, but i love the little round perfectly bite sized cubes of ice. Crushed but not too crushed, cubed but not too big, the perfect ice. That ice machine would make a nice addition to my kitchen if anyone is looking for Christmas gift ideas.

Seating isn't terribly inviting, more like a fast food eatery, which i guess fits since it's a fast food eatery."}
{"text":"First time ever to a Which which and this place bit the big one! I had no idea how to order but watched and figured it out. Nobody working there asked me if they could help, no welcome, no hello. Ordered a chocolate milkshake and got an overflowing mess of a cup, which the server noticed as he handed it to me anyway. Then found out the bottom half of my cup was a blob of vanilla ice cream. My husband took it back to the counter while I used the ladies room. Apparently the solution was to add a ton more milk and reblend so I ended up with essentially a slightly brown milk that didn't even remotely resemble chocolate or a shake. Ugh. I'd rather go to subway!"}
{"text":"Alright Scottsdale, it's time to stop losing your collective shit over Which Wich. I'll probably get slammed for saying this, but does anyone else out there feel like they're eating Quiznos or Cousin's subs when they're having a Which Wich sandwich?

I get that you can \"customize\" your order by writing your wish list on the bag. But in the end, it pretty much comes out like any other sandwich shop. I rather just tell the cashier what to take off or put on the sandwich. I rather not have to be stuck doing paperwork just to order a sandwich.

I've been here a couple of times. The latest was last night when I ordered a 7 inch toasted \"Chicken Cordon Bleu\" for $5.99 inclusive of tax. Which wasn't what you would typically think of when ordering a steaming Chicken Cordon Bleu with the ham and cheese stuffed into the chicken. What happened to the cheese oozing out of the chicken?  I get the poetic license in calling this sandwich Chicken Cordon Bleu. But let's get real, its sliced deli chicken, sliced deli ham with some cheese thrown on top of it plus your choice of condiments and toppings."}
{"text":"Was in town for meetings and needed a quick option for lunch. This is a great concept and it allowed me to build my own sandwich from a list of options. I will be back to this one for sure. The employees were very friendly."}
{"text":"Went to which Wich for lunch yesterday and as always wonderful service and yummy sandwich. Jen B. Must have taken her nasty pill on 6/1"}
{"text":"The use of a \"complex\" ordering system keeps the low iq people, like the gentleman below out. The sandwich was soooo good. The muffeletta had an awesome tapenade, cronic.  A little pricey, but they pile the meat on there. The 3star review is because of the bossy manager lady constantly yelling and micro managing the lackeys like she was Gordon Ramsey. Oh. They have melloyello, too."}
{"text":"Just moved from Florida..

I'm trying to catch up on my reviews since my big move to the area. I visited Which Wich a couple of weeks ago when searching for a late night French Dip close to my hotel , and I found this place on yelp. While I am more of a family owned deli as my go-to sandwich shop, nothing was open at 8:30 at night close to my hotel..  So i had my fingers crossed that I was not going to be disappointed. I was pleasantly surprised with the sandwich, it definitely hit the spot. 

Another thing I want to highlight.. I walked in and was greeted right away with a warm welcome, followed by asking if this was my first visit. It was my first time, and I loved after knowing that I was not only educated on the ordering process, local favorites were pointed out

Overall stellar customer service, and great spot to pick up a quick bite."}
{"text":"Food was fine, but beyond the food the customer service was awful.. the cashier was an older woman and was talking poorly about her employees right in front of my boyfriend and I while we were paying! She was talking so much crap and at the beginning. Also extremely overpriced we split a 10.5 inch sandwich and it was $15!!! What in the world?! And when I asked why it was so much the woman quickly replied, \"because those are our prices...\" never coming back, especially to this location."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with GrubHub delivery it was the food this time the Ruben was or seem to be microwaved and was soggy unlike the last time. I requested a roll because last time the crust on the rye was hard. No option for roll I guess. For the price I will find someplace else to get a subs kind of sandwich"}
{"text":"Is anyone running this store? You don't answer the phone, your hours on WhichWich.com show opening at 12:00 pm, with first online order pickup at 12:30. You make it very difficult to be a customer."}
{"text":"I agree with Katie W! Jake is my favorite employee, always nice and knowledgable. Great guy, great service. I'll be coming back when he's in! Made my sandwich just how I like it. You can expect me back just for his great service!"}
{"text":"I hate leaving crappy reviews about people and places but seeing as how I have left comments for the company on their website, and received no response from them, I will go public with them:) 

I have eaten here 2 times too many this week, and twice I have had issues with the same woman (Jill). On my first visit she openly complained about  how \"over it\" she was and continued to belittle her staff by yelling at them with a restaurant full of customers. The second time I went in, she did not acknowledge my existence throughout the ENTIRE transaction.... I stood there, handed her my card, got my drink, all while not once being greeted or asked ANY questions at all.... But luckily(debatable) for the people behind me, she did say hello to them while ringing me up and simultaneously ignoring me. Also she began to once again be rude to her staff and her employees.

Also, the sandwiches are Meh, they have a crappy selection of chips, if they aren't out all together, and their tea never has any syrup in it. EVER."}
{"text":"They have pretty good customer service always nice, but now their bags don't have hot or cold which. And so without asking they just heat your sandwich, no matter the type of sandwich. Just explain to me who the fuck heats egg salad and without asking?. Like what?!? I love this place but come on common sense ppl!! Couldn't even go back to get it corrected because I picked up my toddler and to make the trip all the way back would have been such a hassle. Dam waste of a 14\" sub."}
{"text":"***Understand thousands of people touch the bags you use to place your order with*****

I went in to order a sandwich and ended up not eating it.

I took pictures of the person who was making the sandwiches. This employee never changed her gloves even after I said something. She was touching the nasty greasy slide that holds the orders after everyone with bare hands was also touching it. I also saw the employee mess with a printer I assume that prints out multiple online orders all while wearing the same gloves.

I said something to all of them including who I assume is the manager and they all just looked at me like I had spiders crawling on my face and then went about their business totally ignoring my comments about the gloves. Kyle actually rolled her eyes at me an laughed."}
{"text":"New spot recently opened uptown. Sandwiches are good & it will probably fill a good niche."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a solid 5 stars. I've been there twice in less than two weeks, once alone and then with my honey. I got a chicken sandwich with bacon both times. She got a bowl. Every food item has been spot on each time and staff was helpful and pretty quick with the service both times. Extra special cherry on top for them having rice crispy treats for dessert, too! Oh yeah, get the punch card and come on Tuesdays for the double punch day."}
{"text":"When I went here for the first time w my friend, who has been here a few times has introduced me to good food. It is easy as 123 & ABC. You pick out your order and check off the items you pick out and give it to cashier and they make it fresh right in front of you. The food is to die for and healthy unlike some places. 
The cashier named russ was very welcoming as we walked in and polite to all customers. I was very impressed and would recommend it to all my friends."}
{"text":"Why do I need so many choices? I'm sorry but I like having a sandwich semi-constructed for me with the option to add/remove toppings. I don't want to build it from the ground up. If I did I would stay home and grab random things from the refrigerator. Prices seemed a bit steep for what you're getting. Service was just \"ok.\" 

I don't see myself coming back or recommending this place."}
{"text":"After I figured out HOW to order my food, I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich.  I'm glad to see that I'm not the only yelper that was quite confused at first!  I like the atmosphere of Which Wich.  I know some people commented on it feeling \"cold,\" however, I just think it is modern.  The biggest tip I can give to new comers is that you have to write your order on the sandwich bag and then bring it up to the cashier.  I love this concept because you can get your sandwich exactly how you want it.  They even have sauerkraut.  As a german girl, I really appreciate that ;)

The sandwich I picked was a \"lite\" choice.  It was delicious!  I got it toasted with low fat mayo and all of the other toppings I wanted and it was perfect.  I would definitely go back here for a quick lunch.  

The ice does come out fast on the ice machine (I noticed another yelper mentioned that) BUT they have the crushed ice.  Mmm, it's my fav!"}
{"text":"Took two kids to Which Wich today. One ordered a turkey sandwich with lettuce and mustard. She got the sandwich and there was mayonnaise all over it. I took it back to counter and was told I have to have the bag to show what I ordered. I get the bag and the one I spoke to didn't say sorry and just shrugged and said they could remake it. Instead of doing it then it fell behind 6 other sandwiches. When we did get it it was obscenely covered in mustard and had no lettuce. It's ridiculous how awful this place and their people act when they don't give you what you pay for. We will never go back."}
{"text":"I just came back from lunch here and I am 100% happy. I guess management already saw these older reviews because I was super impressed with the staff. They were so friendly, greeting everyone as they walked in, and asked if we needed help understanding the ordering system. 

Food-wise: I loved the huge selection they had, I mean what sandwich place has a seafood section? I was impressed by their toppings too - cranberry sauce, coleslaw, avocado, crispy onions, and even chips. Oh and they have milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Nice little quick sandwich shop and certainly better than competitor 'fast-food' sandwich joints such as Subway. It's nice you fill out your own order, so there isn't much room for error, and there are a good number of toppings to choose from."}
{"text":"This place is a huge disappointment. Service is SLOW. Very little meat on the subs and as much as I like the concept the food is not good."}
{"text":"Work ordered us all the boxed lunches today... Small sub, chips, and a cookie.. Not bad, not bad at all..Just wish they included a pickle instead of a cookie."}
{"text":"Always great sandwiches. Everyone in the entire family loves coming here. The kids really enjoyed filling out the paper bags themselves."}
{"text":"It's just a sub shop franchise, not the best place to order Gyros Reubens etc. The stuffings are just average and the bread is again, acceptable. 

I'm giving bumping it up to 3 stars because I like the concept, the decor and reading the complimentary Observer while I eat.

The first time it's like WTF? but you do the routine once and it becomes easy, plus I think it's great that you can work it all out before you get to the cashier. I think the menu needs some work, for example there's no Classic Italian sub combination. 

I've tried small medium and large and what works best for me is small double meat ie less bread. I usually go for the Cuban, not close to authentic but not bad.

Service was always very good but I've never been there at peak times either.
As subs shops go I find it OK."}
{"text":"As a last meal together before he left, my friends and I went into Which Wich over Potbelly's - a mistake. 

We ordered three of the specialty \"The Wicked\" sandwiches. Expecting a quality sandwich, we didn't get what we expected. The service was pretty slow for a chain. Only 4 people staffed and 3 people in the sandwich line (during a busy After waiting nearly 10 minutes for our sandwiches. 

When we spoke up and asked where the bacon was, they gave us 3 measly strips of bacon among three 10'' sandwiches. And offered no apologies.

I don't think the staff knows how to make sandwiches. I truly understand the meaning of \"Which wich\"?!?"}
{"text":"Stopped by after reading this on Yelp. I was pretty impressed! It's a little pricey for what is basically a Subway meal, but with Quiznos style bread sizes (4\", 10\", 14\"). The ordering method is strange at first, but the learning curve is easy. Overall a good experience but $10+ for a 10\" sub with one meat and cheese, a bag of chips and drink is a tad pricey, so that knocks off a star.  Would recommend it! I'll be back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I have been to both Ballantyne locations and I prefer this one. The place is always clean and the employees are always attentive. It is also not as crowded with corporate people as the community house location. The bread was toasted to perfection and with just the right amount of ingredients. My only complaint is that I find most of their sandwiches too salty for my taste. Particularly, their meats, but when I'm hungry and short on time, I would rather get a sandwich here than the other sandwich chains."}
{"text":"After tweeting for the 3rd time about their horrible service, which wich decided to contact me. I was given a number for their \"customer care line\" and I had to take the time to call them. I called that number and gave my complaints and call back number. A few days later I received a call from the GM and I was unable to take the call because I was working. She left a voicemail and told me to call her back at the Tempe store. I had some time to return the call the next morning, so I called at 10:48 am and asked for the GM by name (Sophia) and the employee that answered the phone asked me why I was calling and I told her I was returning Sophia's call about a complaint. The employee then told me that they were busy with their lunch rush (before 11am?) and asked if Sophia could return my call later when they weren't busy. I said okay and gave her my contact info but I have yet to receive a call back and frankly I'm tired of wasting my time on this. Their twitter account is no help. Their Headquarters is no help. Unless you like throwing away money, I would avoid this company at all costs."}
{"text":"As far as I'm concerned this is just another sandwich shop, not great, not bad.  You get a crayon stub and mark a brown paper sandwich bag.  I ordered \"The Wicked\", 5 meats and 3 cheeses, the spices, the dressing , and hot (\"hotwich\") rather than \"coldwich, and a choice of white or wheat and size  7\" or 10 1/2\" or 14\".  $1.95 for a fountain drink (nice variety of drinks) so the sandwich 10.5\" and drink was $11.95 + tax $0.93.  The meats were fair and cheese likewise and the bread was very good lightly toasted.  Service was a bit slow but friendly and everything appeared clean in this small restaurant.  Too many other choices to return here but was worth trying."}
{"text":"Oh hmm. Walking in here, seein bags with markers. Do I get to fill in bubbles like I did in school?! Why, yes. Yes I do. Now mind you, this place is definitely going to be hard if you're intoxicated, luckily I wasn't.

So I stroll up trying to figure out how to order and at the same time not being weird doing it. So I decide to get a French dip sandwich, get the bag to fill it out and then I say what the?!? What should I put in a French dip sub? I think mozzarella with pesto and caramelized onions with tomatoes, bell peppers, and mushrooms will do.

Now, if you think that's not a French dip sandwich, you're probably right. I like to think of it as if a cheese steak sub got it on with a French dip sub in the sandwich producing line, this oddly shaped overflowing sub comes out. This is the French cheese steak dip.

And the verdict. Awesome. As this restaurant goes along with that as well. I'll definitely come back here. The only downside to my 5 star recommendation is that it is a little pricey, but still...add on all those add ons and you're golden."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I LOVE THIS SANDWICH SHOP! My wife and I were first introduced to it while living in San Antonio, TX. When we moved away, we both admitted that, aside from a few friends, Which Wich was the only thing about San Antonio that we would miss.

The neat thing about this restaurant is that you build your sandwiches before you even get to the register. So, ultimately, the attendant at the register is just there to take your money. That also pretty much eliminates the possibility of your order being wrong, as you've specifically annotated every detail of your sandwich on the little brown bag beforehand!

My wife and I always opt for a chicken-based sandwich. Our toppings are similar, in that we both get the standard lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, etc. Where we differ is in our love of spice. My wife likes the banana peppers. I like the jalapenos. For some reason, my wife doesn't enjoy a runny nose while she eats her sandwich...what a weirdo!

My daughter, on the other hand, LOVES the PB&J!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VuCZEIRXIh82TuKezSZKoA?select=ZQcOT7XhU0d2-pWYbu-wWA#NRt3OfYPakxYJgyOUI_glA They give you the option to have the crusts cut off. It's a fantastic way to let your child cover their faces with a peanut butter grin. Well, I know I get a kick out of that...whatever.

Now, don't be deceived upon entering this place. Since the paper bags are right near the entrance, it appears that you might be in for an extended wait for your meal...especially if you come right during the lunch rush. However, the sandwich makers at this establishment are VERY efficient (rivaling Jimmy John's) with making their sandwiches. So, even though it LOOKS like it will take a while, the wait ends up being FAR shorter than you might expect.

One interesting factoid: you can order Which Wich online http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VuCZEIRXIh82TuKezSZKoA?select=ZQcOT7XhU0d2-pWYbu-wWA#r_QZYHunPwfDIhgIolwA2w. That way, even if there IS a line out the door (and there most likely WILL be), you can stroll in, pick up your meal, and walk right out the door!

If you get the chance, PLEASE visit this establishment. You'll thank yourself for it!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Probably only waited 5 minutes for my sandwich. Always get great services. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Always a good choice for lunch. They are fast and their sandwiches are tasty. If you're looking for something sweet, try the chocolate milk!"}
{"text":"My first time at this place and it was awesome! The sandwich special for the month was a Shrimp Po'Boy with Voodoo kettle chips and had the perfect southern Cajun taste. Really like the $3 PBJ sandwiches they have, which they donate a new sandwich to the 'PBJ Project'!"}
{"text":"First and last time I eat here. I ordered Chicken Parmesan Chips & Reg drink...a little over $10.00. Took over 15 minutes! Surprised there was no real chicken breast but sliced or shredded chicken bits. This is the first Chicken Parm. I've had that had sliced chicken and not a regular breast. Not impressed...took way too long, drinks are expensive and food below average."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that the food itself was very good.  I enjoyed my sandwich and my friends seemed to enjoy theirs.   The problem I found was the ordering system.  You first pick your type of sandwich (meat, seafood, veg., etc.) then you pick the bread and fix-ins; and there are alot of those.  But here is the start on why I don't like the system.  You are creating your own sandwich, something that you think may go with something else may not and you ruin your sandwich.  Although I did enjoy my sandwich, the olive spread I put on it took away from the other ingredients.  If I wanted an olive spread sandwich I would have ordered that in the first place.  Second, the system ends up being a little slow if you have a group as each person orders one at a time.  By the time the last person got their sandwich, the first person was done."}
{"text":"The bread is good.  The meats are good, although double meat is reccommended, especially for the Wicked.  Good deal and much better than the alternative spots."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches but portions are small in my opinion. A lot like Potbellys.

Ordering process is a bit tedious but I am sure it gets easier every time you go back."}
{"text":"I only came here because my friend wanted to get a sandwich. It seems like a simple concept to mark what you want and how, with very specific choices.  
I ordered chicken- got turkey
I ordered sliced egg- got no sliced egg
I ordered spinach- shred lettuce only
I ordered honey mustard-got ranch

Really?  It seems like the likelihood of getting it wrong would lower. 

Good ingredients, pretty clean, average drink selection, and average chip selection. Yay bathrooms!"}
{"text":"Service is fast and friendly albeit they sometimes make order mistakes. Options are endless. Tastes good. Perfect triad.

They have really yummy vegetarian options too. It's not just a cheese sandwich like some places do. They have artichokes, caprese, black bean patties, avocado, and hummus as sandwich bases. And the toppings are so much better than Subway's or whatever sandwich place on campus. Unfortunately, veggie sandwiches are the same price as their massive meat sandwiches. 

Another downside: they are absurdly stingy. They skimp on their ingredients. The caprese mozzarella is deli-sliced cheese rather than the fresh chunks of mozzarella in actual caprese. I definitely would not have come all the way here over Espresso Royale if I had known that they would cheap out. Who has ever heard of a caprese with sliced cheese? The only way they could do it worse is if they had used shredded mozzarella. They spread on pesto like it's about to be banned from the Western hemisphere, and I almost thought they forgot to put on feta cheese until I pulled out my microscope and noticed a few white crumbles stuck to a spinach leaf. 

So... Yeah... I'm not sure what to say... If you really like giant pieces of bread with some flavor, and you don't care what you eat, probably come here. Otherwise, I'd stick with places that put effort into what they do."}
{"text":"this restaurant is really good. I always choose this over subway. food is really tasty, service is good. And very reasonable price."}
{"text":"This joint is tucked away in a small corner of Birkdale.  It was a Quiznos, that as far as I saw, no one ever ate there.

Anyway, there is a reason while all the yelpers gave it 4 or 5 stars!!!  Simply put, they have a ton of variations, allowing you to totally customize your 'wich. 

They load the meat on!  It is freakin' out of this world....... MMMMM getting hungry after this review......."}
{"text":"NO WICH

No, can't recommend this place to anyone.  Let's look at what's wrong with Which Wich.  

Ordering:  New to store so I don't want to review the online ordering, except for one thing.  I looked before driving to the shop and it appears that you cannot get all of the sandwich variations in the system.  

In store ordering:  Fill out an order on the bag?  Who came up with this?  Goofy, and again, not all options are on the bag.  Why not 3 or 4 iPads with the whole menu?  Take a hint from Arby's or McDonald's,  automate and diplay each order on a screen above the sandwich makers.  

Service:  Clerk appeared to have drain bamage, empty store when I came in around 4:30, she was staring into space and looking completely indifferent to weather they had business or not.  Sandwiches came up quick (too quick), and not even a \"thank you\" for my order.
Food:  Blah, no should be BLAH, tasteless attempt at sandwich making,.

Turkey on wheat.  Believe it or not, turkey was less flavorful than Subway, and costs more. 
North Philly Cheesesteak.  What an insult to the Amoroso's roll.  Provolone cheese was sliced so thin I had to look for it.  Above I mentioned too quick service, the meat must have been precooked and was not ribeye.  Precooked flat taste, must have been in a warmer or microwaved.  \"Onions and grilled peppers\" were cold.  Cheap cheesesteak strikes again.  Oh and if you're from any where in the Delaware Valley,  don't look for a chickensteaks either.
Bowlwich in a bowl,  Only 3 Italian meats?  Last time I was in a Lee's the had 8 or so.  
Cheesesteaks and hoagies should have an Appellation Controlee to inforce a minimum quality standard.  

Final
About even with Subway, but more expensive.  Less control over what you order since you cannot see the product being made.   Keep looking, we may find sandwich Nirvana out there somewhere. . ."}
{"text":"5 stars is not enough for which wich!  I love their ordering system so much.  I get exactly what I want on my favorite item -  a chicken cordon bleu bowl - and it's always fresh and delicious.  Friendly, fast service every time!  Which wich is my favorite sandwich place.  Even the ice is awesome.  I'm so excited that they've opened a new location near my work so now I can enjoy it more often."}
{"text":"To be fair, I'm usually happy with my food and I do appreciate the many veggie options as well as their punch cards. However, this is a sandwich only restaurant and I consistently have to wait about 20 minutes for them to make ONE sandwich! I normally come in around 2 pm and it's not busy. I cannot wrap my mind around how it can take this long to make a sandwich (and every time). I've never gotten an apology for the wait so I imagine it's not uncommon. Today the toppings were very poorly distributed- I found 7 inches worth of hummus in about 1 inch. Prices are pretty comparable to Jimmy John's and the like."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time at least once a week and today for the first time we were told we could only chose 2 chesses. Whats funny is my fiance only eats meatball with 4 types of cheese and the house chips and we have never heard this before. Guy behind the counter was super rude and was like so what do you want after paying almost 15 dollars for 2 sandwhiches this is not how we should be treated. Then we get home begin to eat out sandwhiches and his sandwich has no house chips and my sandwhich that i paid 1 dollar extra for avocado had none on it. We will not be going back its sad because we really liked this place but its gone downhill fast."}
{"text":"Looked like a nice concept, but the smell inside the restaurant and ice cold temperature were unbearable. We could not even stay long enough to order:( smelled terrible 

We went at 6pm weeknight. Service was great though. They explained how to order which was simply checking boxes next to ingredients on a paper bag."}
{"text":"I like this place, but prefer other locations. Today tuna was dry and fishy. Philly cheese was tasty, bit still no ketchup available. Too dry without it. I like their loyalty program. Rewards addition add up rather quickly."}
{"text":"Just discovered this sandwich shop. Now we can add them as an option to Jersey Mike's and Jimmy John's. They have a unique ordering system with loads of options. First timers may be a bit intimidated with their process, but help from customers and staff is always there. 
I liked the choices we made and enjoyed the sandwiches. Many add-on options so make sure you take advantage of all the free ones. Also join the online club for special offers and discounts."}
{"text":"This location is great whether ordering online or in store. They are quick accurate and very considerate.

I really appreciate the staff at this store and am very pleased with food and service. 
Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I love which wich sandwiches but this location blows. They are slow as sin and the dining room is always filthy. It really has soured me from choosing which wich over other food places.  Also the trashes are always overflowing, come on!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I have come here several times. The staff is friendly, the store is clean, and the sandwiches are created accurately to exactly what I selected on the bag."}
{"text":"Which Wich always makes customers feel like rockstars. I love how I determine and customize everything I want and they just MAKE IT! I love their shakes and house chips. The Egg Salad Wich has to be my absolute favorite! If you haven't been, try this awesome chain- their sandwiches cannot be beat and there is something for everyone!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are pretty good for a chain shop, but they just can't seem to get my orders correct.  I've given them several chances.  I've ordered on the bag at the store and I've ordered on the iPhone app.  I've tried ordering very simple sandwiches, and I've tried ordering when I'm the only person in the restaurant. Regardless, they consistently find ways to screw up the bill and/or the sandwich.

I can appreciate that mistakes happen in any restaurant, and the young people who work here seem well-intentioned.  But the problems are persisting, and reviews here lead me to believe I'm not the only one having this problem.  Maybe the system is just too complicated for the staff who work here.  

Even though it's the only sandwich shop for many miles, I don't see myself going back here."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Which Wich.  The bag ordering thing was a little confusing but the cashier helped me out.  I got the 10\" wicked their signature sandwich.  Much bigger than I expected.  Made just the way I ordered it.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! If it was up to my boyfriend we would eat here every day! The staff here are just down to earth. The food is great and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Great food but slow as molasses. I ordered online hoping to pick up my food on the way to a work meeting. It's been thirty minutes since I ordered and I'm still standing here waiting. :( The kid was nice and apologized but honestly it doesn't do me any good if I'm late to my meeting."}
{"text":"Ok, I cannot say this place isn't for everyone, however I just don't like it! I am a BLT and egg salad person. Both of those sandwiches are disgusting from here. Anyone who gets a BLT should expect real slices of bacon... not bacon crumbles. Their egg salad tastes like it has sat in the fridge for a few days. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I just went to which today In the morning omg it was one of my best breakfast ever the sandwiches are awsome . Best sandwich place in town"}
{"text":"Yes, this is a sandwich shop that I'll be back to time and time again.  The Yelpers are right, it's completely overwhelming.  But have no fear, a trusty Which Wich employee will see your bewildered look and come to your rescue.  

I read the reviews, and braced myself before I entered the sandwich emporium.  I'm sure that you could see the whites all the way around my eyes when I looked at the menu and selection of bags.  The girl behind the counter came over to me, welcomed me and then talked me through ordering exactly what I wanted.  She said that the Italian grinder is the most popular, and for good reason.  So that's what I got.  

I liked the different options and sizes that separates this place from Subway.  It is a little more expensive - but if you're careful, you can get away with a great deal.  The ingredients were fresh and delicious.  I had avocado added to mine, and that was my best decision all day.  It was that beautiful light green, and piled throughout my sandwich!  This is an excellent choice for a lunch stop.  Like subway on steroids (but with brownies and Rice Krispies instead of cookies)."}
{"text":"This was my second Which Wich experience.  Fortunately or unfortunately for this place, I had a fantastic first experience at the one on Woodlawn.  This location was just ok.  

Which Wich as a whole is immediately confusing, but the way that this location is set up doesn't allow any staff member to quickly come to your assistance.  The bags/menu are far away from the cash register and employees, so if you do have a question you have to leave one area and walk to the other.  The employees here we're not terribly friendly either.  Maybe they're stressed because they just opened?  Maybe I've been spoiled by my great first experience elsewhere.  

Other than the tense ambiance and unhelpful set up, this trip was fine.  My sandwich was great, ingredients were fresh.  Oh!  But the house chips are nothing special.  I thought they were going to be homemade chips, because they are in a brown paper bag and say \"house chips\" on them. Nope.  Just basic ripples with some kind of seasoning on them.  Total disappointment.  I live closer to this location but will be driving to Woodlawn next time I'm craving a grinder."}
{"text":"I went in Sunday 12/11 with a restaurant.com coupon. I let the cashier know it was my wife's and I first time coming in. There was a girl and a boy working the back. The girl pointed to the stand where all the sandwich bags were and told us to follow the directions. She than took 23 minutes to make 2 sandwiches. It looks like she was the only one working because the dark haired boy was just standing there looking clueless. After waiting forever for my sandwiches there was no apology, just a blank stare. When I got home to eat my food there was a HAIR IN MY SUB. I would never go back to this location, the crew is clueless and have no earthly idea what customer service is. If they are not trained in the most simplest of concepts when it comes to the restaurant business than I can only assume management, upper management, and the owner are completely clueless. There are way to many restaurants and sandwich concepts to deal with this amateur staff."}
{"text":"Which Wich was very new to me and I'm sure a lot of people
At first I did not get the ordering system
I stood standing there wondering what to do with the brown bags
But I figured it out
I think it's a pretty good way to order but I think the paying part and actually processing your order is where the line sort of starts
From there you pay and then the \"line\" of workers make your order
The cuban sandwich was pretty good
The size was good as well
The only baby complaint I had was the bread, maybe next time I won't get it toasted
It felt a little too flaky and dry
But the sandwich was good and I am not very hard to please
The decor is nice and the manager was friendly"}
{"text":"Which Wich is a chain I heard some good things about, so it intrigued me to find out they were opening a downtown Madison location! I went in to grab a quick lunch to go, and before I could even attempt to check in on Yelp (I couldn't either because it didn't have a page yet =/), I was happily greeted by an employee asking if i've ever been to a Which Wich before. I said no, and he gave me an overview of their ordering process. It was thoughtful of them to have an employee just to make sure people knew what they were doing at least during their first week of business! It certainly helped too, because Which Wich does things differently. There, you pick up a bag, and fill in a bunch of bubbles to describe what sub you'd like, including the toppings, sauces, the temperature of the sandwich, and size of sandwich. Then, you just give it to the cashier, and then they charge you. It's different, but I bet this system works better for the employees in the end, so I think it's fine.

The sandwiches charge a flat rate for the most part: A small is $5.50, a medium is $8.25 and a large is $11.00 (I think). So, you'll notice that it's a bit pricier than say, Jimmy Johns or Subway up the road, but I think you're getting what you pay for here. I had a medium black bean patty sub with a ton of sauces and random veggies on it, and I can say that: I liked it a fair amount, it was filling, I didn't feel ripped off, and I didn't feel garbage after eating it. Given that I had no idea what I was doing the first time, I certainly could make a better sub the next time I go, without too many unnecessary things. One good thing about Which Wich is that you feel like you have more control over your sandwich than you do at the other sub places. It's easy to make your food vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, healthy, unhealthy (or \"Epic\", as some people call it), carnivore (They're known for a sub that has 5 different meats and 3 cheeses), etc. etc.

Overall, I could see myself frequenting Which Wich on State occasionally. It's much better than any other sub place in the vicinity, and it even can hold a candle to some of State's other good lunch spots."}
{"text":"FINALLY a Which Wich in my neighborhood.....I mean things just keep getting better and better within striking distance of my Apartment. There are ALWAYS new Establishments being opened in my hood and this is one of the best things to come. I mean you get your bag.....select your toppings......bread.....condiments.....etc.....hand the bag to the cashier......pay for it......wait very shortly......and walk out. I mean it doesn't get any better and the customer service is awesome. Let me also mention it is in a prime location near the intersection of Tatum and Shea Blvd.....and the place is simply immaculate. If your ever in my hood and want a REALLY GOOD sandwich pay Which Wich a visit. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great range of choices for creating your sub. Just hope they get it right.

Of 6 visits in the past 2 months, 4 of the orders were wrong. 
Additionally, the ingredient quality seems to be hit and miss.

The people here are very friendly and always try to make things right, but the mistakes have caused me to add this to my \"Only if friends insist\" list."}
{"text":"Very good subs.  A pleasant switch from the other sub shops.  Ordering on a bag was different the crew was very prompt to recognize my confusion and quick to explain.  On my next visit I was a pro at ordering.

I had a pizza sub and will be back for this again.  Crew was cheerful and helpful."}
{"text":"This has been my go-to sub shop lately. Service is fast and friendly and it's a clean space. The thing I love most about Which Wich is the variety of toppings and the ability to customize your sandwich without standing in a line telling the employee what you want.

As soon as you walk in, you're greeted. They explain the ordering process if you don't already know. They have a menu on the wall which corresponds to bags (turkey, chicken, beef, etc.). Then you take that bag and mark down how you want it (white or wheat or lettucewrap or salad). Then select toppings from cheeses to veggies to seasonings. And some of them are unique like fried onions, olive salad, various peppers and different mayos. I usually get something different every time I come in. 

Last night I got a french dip on wheat with provolone, roasted red peppers, hot pepper mix, sauteed onions, mushrooms and black olives. It was really good and the au juis that comes on the side soaked into the bread well, but it was a bit messy and hard to keep the toppings from falling into the broth. The taste was still good. I was so hungry I didn't get a picture. 

And their reward card is worth it. Once you get so many points, you earn free subs and on your birthday they send you a free sub coupon. Don't worry if you lose your card. They can look up your phone number to add your points."}
{"text":"Ordered a cobb salad wrap and the bacon was wrapped separately not included in the wrap. It is impossible to unwrap wrap and add bacon. Other locations include the bacon in the wrap vs on the side.  Then, after eating half the wrap found a black hair in my food. Gross. Will never go to this location again and waste of $7.75 I spent that didn't eat. So disappointed."}
{"text":"I enjoy which wich but I only go like once every other year for some reason. I should go more cause I like it!  Last week when I went, I got a veggie sub toasted with hummus, mozzarella, pesto, and a bunch of veggies, but I don't remember which ones, on wheat bread. It was pretty tasty! I am a huge hummus fan, like I could down a whole container of hummus in record time (and I have). However, there was a little too much hummus on my sandwich, so next time maybe I'll ask for them to go light on the hummus. Also I was kinda in a rush, there was no one else in line and three people working, service was a little bit slow. Looked like 2/3 were kinda standing around doing nothing while one person did all the work. But otherwise good! Food seems fresh, better than most other sub shops I can think of!"}
{"text":"I have had a few different sandwiches here, some are definitely better than others. I like the grinder, and add pesto to mine. 
 
They have a nice variety of toppings available, which I think make or break the sandwich. 
 
I would agree with other reviewers that they are overpriced and have a serious seating comfort problem. Going here with my 3 and 5 year old is a problem due to the mainly tall stool seating arrangement."}
{"text":"This is one of the best lunches I've had in quite a while. Not only was the food outstanding but so was the service. As soon as I walked in the door I was greeted by the friendly staff with an explanation of the menu. The employees were well trained for exceptional service.  I was checked on halfway through my mall even though this is consisted fast food. Highly recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"This sandwich shop is fantastically unique.  You walk in to a large wall of bags.  Choose the bag that matches your taste for the day (turkey, seafood, veggie, breakfast, etc).  Choose the size.  You then mark the bag with all of your requests.  Your sandwich could be made on white or wheat or in a bowl (think salad) or lettuce wrap.  Hot or cold.  Add your selection of cheeses, veggies, and toppings.  There is a large selections of toppings - so each trip could be a completely different combination.

The menu also offers kids options and vegan options.

They also offer shakes, cookies, and cookie sandwiches for a dessert.  The shake was thick and full of toppings.  A good add to my healthy sandwich.

I love the customizable options at this place.  The vast selection and fresh ingredients offer a great variety to meet any taste.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept. You can create your own sandwich by checking the boxes on their sandwich bags. It's different. Their sandwiches was alright. I think I would rather go to Earl Sandwiches in Tempe than here if I had to choose."}
{"text":"Oooh! I like this place! We wanted to grab a sandwich before our nail appointment and were in the neighborhood, so decided to try it out.
Love the whole set up! A wall of sandwiches from which to choose and then personalize gives an infinite number of possibilities. We chose the chicken salad with carmelized onions and pickles which they served warm on a thin, soft tasty roll. So yummy, especially because there's not a ton of bread to slog through (my pet peeve with Subway-type places.) They offer 3 sizes, and sharing one medium was plenty.
Service was pleasant and FAST and the price very reasonable in a bare bones environment.
I headed back again and tried the club.  Really delicious and customized perfectly for me.  Now, which to try next time ..."}
{"text":"The cost!!! My god, the cost. $14. For a single sandwich.  That is nuts. The food was the same quality as subway.  Honestly, if you're going to charge that much, your quality or speed must be a differentiator, and they were not.

Save money and time, and hit the Subway for the same quality sub."}
{"text":"Finally Which Which opened its doors in south Charlotte. I've been to their two other locations and thought they were pretty good, so I headed here for a late lunch. I called in my order, and they said it would be ready in 10-15 minutes (what I asked for). I drove over and walked in, and my sandwich was ready.

Let me take a step back and talk about the place itself. If you've been to a Which Which you can probably skip this paragraph as this Which Which looks like all of the others. Lots of metal and a nice modern vibe. Light wood chairs--you get the gist. 

The food is also pretty good. Normally you take a bag and fill out the little circles on the bag with what you want--but they did this for me when I got my takeout. I got a Chicken Pesto on toasted white and it was pretty good. Nice change from Firehouse. It was pretty good!

Service was good, the woman at the register was nice enough and she said that it had been very busy for lunch, which I would expect considering the location near Ballantyne.

Its a good alternative to a usual sandwich place and definitely worth a shot! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've always passed by this place at Westgate many times and finally decided to stop by on a whim at the PV location. It's a cool concept, and do enjoy how customizable the sandwiches are. Maybe it's because it was my first visit, and I didn't quite know what I wanted to try, but the sandwich itself was just maybe slightly better than something I'd get at Subway. Still, seeings how it is slightly better and barely costs more, I think I'll give it another go and switch up the ingredients next time."}
{"text":"So far, not a fan...  In their defense, I tried them not long after they opened.  Maybe they were still working out the kinks.  I had heard from friends that the food was great, so we wanted to try them.  Tried to order online, but the newish store was not in the online ordering system yet.  So in I went...  Was unpleasantly surprised that I had to write my own order down.  Wouldn't normally be such a bad thing, but trying to wrangle a 1 year old and fill out order bags for 4 subs was NOT fun...  Then I stood and waited for a half hour (not exaggerating) while they made our subs and there were only 4 people ahead of me in line.  With at least 6 employees making subs, that seemed like a very long time.  Again, factor in the impatient 1 yr old...  They called one of my son's subs out, then three other people, which didn't make sense, since I watched them hang our entire order together.  When I finally had our order and got home, I discovered that there were 6 things incorrect on my sub (including my meat choice), which seems very odd considering that the ingredients are written right on the bag that they are stuffing the sub into...  Bread was stale-ish.  the other ingredients, although not what I ordered, seemed to be good quality."}
{"text":"Went in for an ice cream cookie sandwich. Had never been to a which wich before so I was unaware of the ordering process. Someone I think was the manager was restocking items near the order bags. He's barked \"have you been here before\"? I said no and he quickly gave a rundown about filling out the bag to order. I told him we just wanted an ice cream cookie sandwich and asked where I could get a writing utensil. He literally threw a red sharpie in my direction and went back to stocking items. Great first....and last impression. Never again. The sandwich was so so but the customer service was horrible."}
{"text":"This place was cool... another sandwich place, but you write your order on a premarked bag and hand it to the cashier.  The variety was good and the kids meals come in a box with fruit and veggies and a drink for $5.  The ordering confusion threw us off at first but it tasted really good for the price.  I would go back... Jersey Mikes tastes better but WichWich definitely wins on variety and originality."}
{"text":"So after trying out a Which Wich in LA and then seeing one in Glendale. I was very excited to see a brand new one opening in the shopping center next to the Men's Warehouse at Tatum Blvd & Shea. 

I love their concept of pick your sandwich choice from the assorted options, write out your preferences on the paper bag numbered for your choice and then they make it up for you fast and fresh. These sandwiches are delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but I feel like I should have tipped myself as you are asked to write down your order on a bag. I get that it is part of their desired experience, I'm just not a fan. Food was good, I'm just lazy. :)"}
{"text":"Lots of potential... Horrible product. Only thing good here is the house chips.  My wife and I tried to the first time today and won't be going back"}
{"text":"The concept is interesting here, making the patron take their own order, so to speak. It's cute - sharpies to mark your order and very clearly printed bags and a neat system for that.  Bring your own Sharpie if you're a germ-o-phobe!

I got the black bean veggie patty sandwich on wheat bread toasted with cheese and some fixins and they got the order exactly right.  I agree with another reviewer that the bread wasn't the best.  Pretty tasteless and questionably fresh.  I got through the order line quickly and my sandwich was finished very quickly as well.

I will look forward more to enjoying this sandwich shop when it's not surrounded by construction.  I didn't mind it, but some folks might not like walking past the empty under-construction dusty store fronts while the little mall gets itself in order.

The place is pretty bare-bones on decor, as are most quick-serve places these days. Loud with concrete floors and seating comfort definitely designed for the quick luncher.

They could probably benefit from a livelier staff; everyone was a little low-energy, and a more vibrant team would have made me more excited to enjoy my sandwich.  I will go back again sometime."}
{"text":"We love Which Wich. The ingredients are much fresher than most sub places. You can make your sandwich to order with much more variety than most sub places. The bread is better than most sub places. And they have milkshakes and housemade chips that are delicious. This location has a super fun and friendly crew. I like the cuban, turkey, PB/banana/bacon... and I.love the pepper mix."}
{"text":"Sandwich ordering process is a little cumbersome.  That being said my grinder on whole wheat was very good."}
{"text":"Awesome concept. Love all the options & toppings. Overall, Phoenix area lacks in good/original  sandwich spots. 

But ... Tables are usually dirty. I've found large pieces of plastic in my sandwich (probably plastic wrap).  The last time I was at this location, an employee was carrying around a bucket, in the dining area, a few times, with a toilet brush and cleaning supplies. The boy cleaned the bathrooms and then came back out with his cleaning supplies and arranged in touch things near the drink area and soda machine.  I was totally grossed out and still can't go back."}
{"text":"Great place, haven't been open long, but DEFINITELY my favorite quick chain sandwich spot in the area.  double punch Tuesdays are a must, as is the buffalo chicken lettuce-wich.  I'm dieing to try the Thank you turkey with cranberry and stuffing, (ON A SANDWICH!?!?)  but the buffalo chicken is so good, I can't get past it.  Ingredients are always fresh, customer service always seem to be above average, and I get a free cookie every time I go because I take 2 minutes to fill out the little online survey from the receipt.  Really cool concept, especially the ordering format, really streamlines everything and makes it easy and quick!"}
{"text":"After driving by this place a bunch of times, I finally stopped in. Place was dead when I arrived and ordering was a little overwhelming for this newbie. The employees were helpful and explained to me the process. There's 10 different sandwiches to choose from and each option has a corresponding brown bag to write down your specifics of the order based on the type of sandwich you pick. There are toppings galore, which is a huge plus for me! It took me a few minutes just to read through the menu and choose my selections. I took my brown bag to the cashier and paid. After a few minutes of waiting, the cookies came out first and were warm. I ate one while I waited for my sandwich and it was pretty good. My total order was a turkey medium sub (10.5 inches), 2 cookies and a large drink for a total of $13. The large drink is good for .50 cents off of a refill if you bring in the cup again. Plus it was kinda cool looking so I bought it. As I was picking up my sandwich, I was told it was made on white bread instead of wheat. I was asked if I wanted them to make it again and but said no because I didn't want to wait again for my sandwich to be made. I've read on other reviews that sandwich orders were incorrect also so this may be somewhat of a problem here, I'm not sure. When I got home and ate my sandwich, I noticed it was a little too salty, not sure why. Overall, I like the concept but would go back and try some things differently :)"}
{"text":"I have been excitedly waiting to try these sandwiches!  And sadly, I was disappointed.  This is a regular sandwich place.  Nothing special.  

I do love the clever name!

The ingredients are fresh and you can really make your sandwich your own.  You walk in and grab a paper bag according to what meat you want.  You pick your sandwich options, toppings and I appreciate that the bags even point out the extra charges.  

I saw a girl picking up four sandwiches and we were chatting.  She grabs bags for co-workers on her way out because everyone can make their order at work right on the bag.  She brings in the bags and their orders are perfect.  The bags are used to put the sandwiches in.  Therefore, there is no gross unwrapping of everyone's sandwich to find out which is yours.  

The staff was friendly and the wait was reasonable.  Your sandwich is made fresh for you.  

I had the Turkey Club (cold).  I really liked the bacon on it.  It was crisp without being too crunchy.  There was no additional cost.  It was the same price as a standard turkey sandwich of the same size.  I felt like I did a little back room deal because I did not pay extra for my bacon.  

They also have spicy mayo!  Here is a little warning, it is mayo with hot sauce swirled in.  I am glad I asked because for some reason I was expecting something a little different.  I went in during the lunch rush (12:30pm).  From the time of purchase to the time of pick-up, it was only about 6 minutes.  Impressive.  Not sure how long a hotwich would take.  

I would definitely go back if I am looking for a sub to eat.  Fresh, simple and decent value."}
{"text":"This place is the bombidggity.com!!  The Matthews location was new when I first tried this chain, so the service was super slow(understandable).  This location is well groomed and gets you in and out with your order being perfect.  With all the choices you get to pick or not pick, the speed is quite impressive!!  I would stress that if you are feeling indecisive, this won't be the best place to dine.  I don't like standing in a line and being rushed on my order so this place suits me perfectly with a brown bag and marker to stand and choose my pickins.  Black bean patty is DELISH!!!  Little heart burn after but so worth it!!  Everything is fresh and delicious and will have you craving it daily!!  They give a frequent customer punch card to earn a free sandwich and it doesn't take 20 punches like most places to earn one.  Go!  Go!  Go!!"}
{"text":"I love the freedom you have in ordering food here.  I'm a \"Toppings\" kind of person and there is no limit to the choices they have on their menu.  Sandwiches are cut diagonally(which always taste better) and ingredients are fresh and tasty each time!  Bonus- they have popcorn ice for your fountain drink.  That makes a party in a cup!  
If you are on the fly though, you might want to wait until you have time for them to prepare.  I've been able to complete many games of 'Words with friends' on my phone while waiting.  Definitely worth it though!!"}
{"text":"Staff helped out being that it was our first time there. They were all so nice! The food was so fresh and the options seemed endless! I was very impressed and will definitely be back. Fun atmosphere! LOVED IT!!!"}
{"text":"Terrific location. Super busy around lunchtime. Kevin my cashier was very funny and knowledgable. The food is very good too. I recommend them for your next meal. It is kind of hidden it,is in the same parking lot as give guys."}
{"text":"This Place Never let's me down. Great service, terrific food, free wifi."}
{"text":"Superior Sandwich? OH YES! 
Stopped in with my wife to check out the local place and I was caught off guard. I was expecting, well, I didnt know what to expect. First you grab a bag that's the type off sandwich you want. Then you fill in the dot for your topping selection. I kinda likes that. Turn in your bag and pay then a short wait later your food is ready.
I got the 'grinder\". Italian meats with what ever I wanted on it. I went pretty traditional with the toppings but added Hot Giardiniera! That made my sandwich \"superior\"! 
The price was fair for the quality of food, and the staff were very friendly. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Decent sandwich place that's better than Scrubway and Jimmy Johns.  Cheesesteak wasn't the best I've had, but decent.  Ordering is genius.  You fill out your order on a sandwich bag,  give it to them, pay and wait.  If it's your first time you won't look like a schlub trying to figure out what you want.  Since it was my first time they gave me a free drink as well, score!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sub shops for a quick stop. Tons of different sandwiches with plenty of customizations. The meatball sub and the Philly cheesesteak are my favorite. The Philly only makes an appearance on the menu a few times a year under their R & D #8 bags. They even import the roll from a bakery in Philadelphia! 

Some outdoor seating is available for nicer weather and people watching in the met. 

Mark the back side of your bag so you can tell where your sandwich is on the line."}
{"text":"I discovered this place about a year ago and it has been a staple of mine ever since. Great sandwiches with countless customization options. Only drawback is the small interior. Seating is limited and it can get uncomfortably crowded at times."}
{"text":"Quick service, quality food. 
I like the self serve system, clean and fast. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"At Which Wich you essentially design your own sandwich. Using premade bags with various options, you can pick the type of sandwich you want and then mark the toppings and dressings you want. They then make the sandwhich and heat it up for you. 
This place is better than you could imagine based on the concept and is well worth the meal.
Based on their recomendation, I branched out and tried the MonteCristo which is essential ham, jelly and powdered sugar. It sounded horrible but they promised me if I hated it they would make me another. It has become on of my favorites and I have odd cravings for it now.
The milkshakes are also worth adding to your combo meal.
Don't go if you are in a hurry because while they are not slow, it is not super fast either especially if there are a bunch of orders in."}
{"text":"I have no complaints. I love the concept of this restaurant. Ordering was easy, there are many toppings to from, and the food is fresh.  Definitely the best sub sandwich I have had in years. I plan on bringing friends and family to eat here in the future when we are exploring Mill Avenue \"Downtown Tempe\"."}
{"text":"This is a good place to grab a sandwich in the booming area of Sun Prairie.  There is a unique concept of ordering on the bag, which the employees are nothing but friendly to help out and explain.

An advantage of this place is that their are a ton of options.  I usually stick with the tried and true turkey club.  The quality of the items taste pretty good, and I haven't had any poor experiences.

One area of concern is that the employees need to do a better job in cleaning up the restaurant.  I feel like each time I go, I need to wipe down the table before we sit.  The second is that the price point is on the higher side of things."}
{"text":"The system at this place is quirky, but the learning curve isn't too steep.

Take a bag from the pocket marked with your meat of choice, and use a marker to specify cooking method, bread type, toppings, etc.

I was impressed with the selection of customizable options, and went overboard during my first visit. The cashier didn't even bat an eye, so I guess that's pretty standard. My sandwich was so stuffed that the bag ripped when they tried to stuff it in. They were generous with the veggies and sauces.

It tasted great, even though it exploded a little after every bite. 

The only problem I had with this location was the wait time. I was one of two customers, with two employees behind the counter, and it took nearly 9 minutes to get the sandwiches out."}
{"text":"Interesting place you order with your own little baggie then you hand it to the counter they make your sandwich call you up and it's in the bag delicious"}
{"text":"Have you not tried Which Wich yet? Do it. 

Buffalo chicken= hands down, my favorite sandwich ever in the world. I can't wait to get pregnant so I have an excuse to eat them every day. 

I used to go to one in CO all the time and I really remembered loving it- when I found out one had opened by my work, it secured a regular spot on my lunch-break rotation until I realized maybe I shouldn't be eating sandwiches all week.  I now prefer to hit up the AJ's next door for cheap tea and salad bar (healthier, obviously) but sometimes I wind up in the parking lot of AJ's only to instead go over to Which Wich... it's seriously delicious stuff. My husband love the Thanksgiving Turkey feast sandwich (probably has a cooler name than that) and my backup fave is the chicken pesto (be sure to add bacon.) Always- and I do mean ALWAYS- get your sandwich toasted. 

Trust me. I'm a fattie who loves her some good sandwiches."}
{"text":"A Wicked with BBQ sauce and Ranch. 

Actually, try anything here, it will be amazing.  The bread is fresh and soft. The ingredients are quality, unlike places like Subway and Quiznos, and everyone is really nice.

At first the ordering system might be a bit overwhelming, but after your first try it will be a breeze.  

Enjoy"}
{"text":"I went here this evening to grab a sandwich and I was greeted by an employee who was very friendly and cheerful. As I was preparing to create my order I looked over behind the counter and I see two of the young female employees texting on their phone with their gloves on. I immediately left the store. 

Do you know how many germs a cell phone carries and these young ladies have the nerve to be texting while wearing gloves and preparing sandwiches. I will continue to visit the Which Which in Audrey Kell!

Put your cell phones down while preparing food."}
{"text":"Pretty solid sandwich spot. A little pricey in comparison to other sandwich places. I got the thanksgiving dinner. Great choice. Chips and drinks are pretty standard. All in all, I would probably come back."}
{"text":"had lunch here today. awesome. i always have the black bean sammy cuz i want to eat like a pretend vegan. it is really good. i add hummus, spinach and all other good fresh stuff. i also have the skinny version to save on calories. you can't go wrong here. quality fresh ingredients and endless choices with sammies and topping.. it's so cute. went to my first location in san diego and was so happy to learn of the location in PV.  Love it. clean, fresh, reasonably priced. you need to go. and all for $6 for a small. it's way better than subway and any other sandwich shop.  feel like going back right now for another sammy. YUM"}
{"text":"Came in at 10:50 all the doors were locked, let me remind you they open at 10! No one is in the store.. one guy comes out unlocks one of the doors and 3 OTHER employees walk out from the back. We order our food, go to get drinks and there is no ice. We ask for them to put ice in the machine and at this time we're the only people in the store. When we got our subs one was made wrong and the other sub was the wrong size. After one of us ate half our sandwich then the ice got filled. We continued to wait until we got our fixed sub. There was zero work ethic from employees and manager. I usually love Which Wich but will NEVER come to this one again. Ruined our whole experience."}
{"text":"So I've been to this place a couple times now and I'm yet to be disappointed.  The size of the medium sandwich is more than large enough for me and im a big guy. The sandwich tastes great and its awesome that you can add all kinds of topping for no extra charge with a few exceptions (avocado, bacon, extra meat, or extra cheese). The staff is friendly and very helpful at teaching you how to order which is fun and different from anything I've personally seen. Definitely better than your average subway sandwich and they have unlimited varieties to choose from.  Great place to have lunch or dinner and the price tag isnt too bad either."}
{"text":"I love the entire concept of this place. There were a few employees at the entrance who showed us how the system worked - pick the type of sandwich you want (turkey, ham, etc.) and then fill out the brown paper bag with the type of bread & fixings you want. 

The sandwich sizes were comparable to other sandwich shops. If you & your dining companion like the same thing, definitely go for the largest size & split it - it saves you a couple bucks."}
{"text":"First time at this establishment located north of the tatum and Shea Blvd intersection. I really like sandwiches and been to others in the PV mall area. Unique way to order your meal in that you actually fill out checkboxes in a brown bag in a la carte fashion and just pay at the register. They take that brown sack and place the order as listed . For example I ordered a 6 inch French dip on wheat with provolone, light mayo and garlic. Great ordering system to get what you want quickly . This worked out for my lunch hour . Oh and the French dip meat and Au jus sauce was delicious!"}
{"text":"Just watched the staff snake a clogged drain and then go straight and put gloves on before making the sandwiches. NEVER WASHED HER HANDS."}
{"text":"We had lunch today at Which Wich.  I think the concept of ordering your sandwich is unique compared to other sub shops.  The staff was friendly and the speed of receiving our orders was good.  My wife had a salad and I had an Italian grinder.  Both of our meals were good.  Their homemade chips were crisp and tasty."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of which wich.  I've been here a few times and each time the food and service have been good.  I also think its neat how you place your order by choosing the bag and marking what you want on the sandwich.  I would definitely recommend WW if you are in the mood for a quick sandwich."}
{"text":"I love coming here. A wide variety of choices that pleases the whole family. I've had a handful of choices but I usually stick with the buffalo chicken or the bacon egg and cheese. I like that they have the nutritional facts easily available so I can stick to my goals. Will definitely be back again. Prices are fairly reasonable."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are so good, especially when you order one of their sandwiches where the meat/veggies are hot.  I've had their salads and lettucewiches and they're really good too.  I just Wich they had more hot Wiches."}
{"text":"Great fresh tasting food. (Think its fresh)
3 stars because the wait is god awful.
I went around 1115am before the lunch rush and it took 1t mons just to get my sub after placing my order and it was a small sub.

Price for small sub $5.80 and pretty filling."}
{"text":"I've had Which Wich before (twice in San Diego), it was very good so I am very excited it is now in Chandler! The bread is soft but yet somewhat like a baguette, but better, I swear! I love how you can build your own sandwich and I love how you can ask them to take the inside of the bread out, they call it the skinny sandwich.  This sandwich shop is total opposite of Jimmy John's whose philosophy is give few choices and make fast sandwiches.  All three times I ate at Which Wich (twice in San Diego and now once in Chandler), the time it takes for them to prepare the sandwich is too long, we waited almost 10 minutes and there were only 2 or 3 people ahead of us, it is for that reason, i gave it 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"I had a BLT with avocado, spinach and cheddar. I was a bit nervous at all the choices. But it was hot, the bread was nicely toasted, the bacon was nicely copied up into chunks which made it great for eating. Veggies were fresh.

You have limited interaction with the staff, counter person who took our order was friendly. 

Seating isn't great. It's uncomfortable and sparse. Sorta like they want you to take it and GO."}
{"text":"If it is your first time here, you might be a little confused on where to start/how to order.

Unless we missed it, there should be a playful sign on how to place your order. 

When you go in head straight for the brown bags that are sectioned off any which kind of meat/veg sand which you want. From there you write your name and check off all of the delicious toppings you want!

Head to the register, they take your bag and $ and it's off to the \"wich makers\"! 

They stuff  your sandwich and it's perfectly delicious! Way better than Subway where you have to awkwardly talk over a glass and ask for some of this and more of that.

It is more expensive than Subway, but you get more for your money and there are a lot more options to choose from.

It's a tight fit in the small wich shop, but well worth the visit. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food has been consistently good. However this visit was disappointing. Not because of food but rather cleanliness of restaurant. All tables dirty. Floors dirty. Drink station filthy. I hope the owner/ manager wakes up. The restaurant was dead at 5pm...no excuse for this."}
{"text":"I love this place! The sandwiches are amazing! Parking sucks bcs you have to pay but if you're going to be on Mill for something else, it is a must stop."}
{"text":"It's not hard to make a sandwich it gets even easier when you have a paper bag listing off the exact things I want on that sandwich. The last two times I've been they have messed up my sandwich. How? How is it possible?"}
{"text":"Quick sandwich place in a convenient spot. Cashier had to explain to me how I was supposed to order by marking my sandwich selection on the paper bag, neat. Several good vegetarian selections, all tasty with fresh ingredients. Gotta add the hot pepper mix, it's got a kick. 

Cute little set up, definitely my go to quick sandwich place when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"They have come along way! Worked out the kinks of a new sandwich shop. No complaints here. Love the concept and I have had consistently perfect sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Once I start on the 'Surf and Turf' seafood sandwich, that is all I need.  It is just so darn yummy, I have not had a chance to change up the sandwich. I am content with my crabmeat and beef with mushrooms, top off with avocado! Yes, I have a winning sandwich that I enjoy and devour every morsel.

Oh, I also like to make my own version of Arnold Palmer - with their green tea and lemonade!

Reminds me of all the times I have ate at the WW in Houston! I KNOW I ate over 15 Surf and Turfs already."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop ! I had the buffalo sandwich and it was great! The kids love to write down what they want on their sandwich. They also offer crust free bread for the kids!  It's a little pricey compared to the other sandwich shops but the meat is a lot better here!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a veggie w extra lettuce and peppers. I literally got a sprinkling of lettuce. It's a veggie sandwich! Like come on! I wound up having to doctor it up w food I had in my fridge. There are better sandwich places out there."}
{"text":"So I've been meaning to do a Which Wich review for awhile. We've been to this one a couple of times over the past year and it hasn't been without it's hiccups. 

There has been a recent change in management and ownership and I can say the transaction was a little bumpy! It typically resulted in inconsistent sandwiches, some with too much or too little this, missing ingredients etc. The downside of Which Wich over some of the other sandwich shops is that you can't see them make it, so it's not until you eat the sandwich do you realize something isn't quite right. 

The one day one of the sandwiches was nearly drenched with sauce by the time we opened it 15 minutes later; not too appetizing. I reached out to management who was not only understanding, but more than happy to make up for the unfortunate meal. I really appreciate Devan's ability to turn a bad experience around and his eagerness to bring up the standards of this Which Wich location!"}
{"text":"I love this sandwich place! The ordering process is unique and I like all of the different options you're given.

I love the gyro sub and the black bean sub with honey mustard. The jalapeño chips are also really tasty--not too spicy, but still have a little kick. If you have a sweet tooth, get an Oreo milkshake they're made with real ice cream.

One fun thing about this place is that you can order your food online and have it ready for you when you get there. It gets busy around noon and the wait can take big portion of your lunch break. If you have time to order online, it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This is the third WW I've been to in the valley and I continue to be underwhelmed...

That said, the concept is clever and convenient (but there's always those forgotten details that the cashier has to clarify) and the prices are reasonable.  I love having lots if options to choose from without having to say it out loud to the sandwich maker (\"what was that?\" \"No, more tomatoes\" \"toasted?\" \"You said a little mayo?\" \"No, I said NO mayo!\")...at least there's a paper trail at WW.

For the most part, the staff has been friendly enough and the locations are clean and tidy.

If I was back in college, I'd probably love it but I'm not sure I would've been able to afford it."}
{"text":"I ordered the avocado & tomato on wheat.  I also ordered other things to go on this sub but I couldn't tell if they were on their by taste or not.  The ooshy gooshy avocado was big time overkill and completely dominated the sandwich.  Now I love avocado, I'll eat it straight with a spoon ya'll, but this avocado mash was border line rotten, yet surprisingly tasteless goop.  It oozed and leaked all over the place.  I think I just ate a green slime sammich.  Not that anyone would be shocked to know this, but I felt ill after eating it.  

However, since this place is brand new in the Sun Prairie area I'm willing to give them another chance sometime down the road.  But I won't be ordering the avocado sludge monster again."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a quick sandwich. The quality is FAR superior to Subway and it's just slightly more expensive. I've never had to wait long either. My only real complaint is that there's never much room inside and there's no decent place to wait for your order! The bar/counter seating is very limited. But I think the food is still worth awkwardly standing and waiting in front of someone's table."}
{"text":"This was our 1st time  here for lunch after the movies.
 The sandwich shop is clean and bright with yellow  posters reminding me of mustard !
The sandwich choices are written on brown paper bags and one has a choice  from looking at  the board or bag,  of a wide variety of sandwiches, toppings  and salads . Once written, one brings their bag to the counter.  All kind  of sandwiches: vegetarian ,meatball ,gyro, Reuben ,BLT, Italian, etc. etc. plus all can be made into salads too.
So there is something here for everybody on the sandwich menu.
Assorted added things from Veges, cheeses hummus, different mustard, spices  and dressings. Sandwiches on wraps or assorted white or wheat baguettes,  and pita bread 
My dining mate ordered a turkey  sandwich on a large  baguette.
I ordered a Cobb salad.
Everything was
fresh and tasty.
Prices moderate. My salad plus a large sandwich was around $19. Staff friendly and accommodating.

{"text":"Great food. Shakes are awesome. Grossly overpriced. Two sandwiches and two Shakes cost just under $40. 37.19 to be exact."}
{"text":"I obtained a few coupons from work so I decided to check Which Wich out for lunch. It was quite busy and being a newcomer I was a bit confused at first. Until I saw the towers of brown paper bags and figured thats how I ordered. Weird I thought at first but hey, its original and that helps. I ordered roast beef, whole wheat toasted. 

The sandwich was good, lacking somewhat in the meat department. But all the ingredients seemed fresh and it was brilliant of me to put horseradish and Dijon mustard on the sandwich."}
{"text":"I really like the vegan options Which Wich has but I honestly don't think it's worth coming to this location.
The employees seem super disinterested in their jobs, which I normally wouldn't care about. But, they end up messing up my order somehow almost every time. My boyfriend and I always come together, and I've noticed that they'll mix up the ingredients that we both write down. They'll put some of what he wanted on my sandwich and vice versa. 
I think it's worth a try if you haven't been here before, but I don't think I will be back to this particular Which Wich."}
{"text":"I work nearby so I eat here pretty often. The workers are always friendly but I've never felt inclined to write a review until now. I ordered a sandwich and one of my condiments was missing, which was pretty frustrating because I didn't notice until i had walked all the way back to work. Normally I would let it slide but I was already getting quite \"hangry\" so I called to lodge a complaint (because they had missed this exact condiment in the past). The way they handled it was definitely 5 star service. They remade my sandwich, offered me a refund AND were incredibly kind about it the entire time. 

Besides their great service, I have yet to create a sandwich here that I didn't think was tasty and flavorful."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite sandwich place! Can't stop thinking zanier how delicious it was! I would probably get double meat for the extra cost next time since I like my sandwiches \"meaty\". So many choices and different options in making a great sandwich, I'll have to come here many more times! Loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is so much better then subway. The employees are very nice. It may take them a while to make the sandwich but you cant rush perfection. I will definitely be comming here more often then subway."}
{"text":"This is a great little sandwich shop. Their tasted sandwiches are the best. The Italian is my favorite. Their Shakes are surprisingly good. 

Yum"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time at this location. The first time, I saw only one worker. When we walked in, he was texting on his cell phone. He was very nice though. It took a very long time to make our sandwiches because it was only him. The tables were also all very dirty but the sandwiches themselves were very good. 
The 2nd time was a disaster. It was packed. There were 3 workers this time. It still took a very long time to get our sandwiches (not a place to go if you want a quick lunch), luckily we had plenty of time, just amazed at how long it took.  The bad part was that the tables and floor were all dirty again. The workers were just standing around talking instead of cleaning when they didn't have customers. A spilled soda was on the floor the entire time we were there and no one bothered to clean it up. Instead, they just put a caution sign on it and called it good. There were only 2 lids left for the soda machine and the most disgusting thing was that every trash was overflowing and a dirty rag was just laying on top. We enjoyed the sandwiches, just not the dirty environment and customer service."}
{"text":"I love Which Wich. Choose your own ingredients from meat, cheeses, veggies and sauces. Unique ordering with friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love all the healthy choices I can make. They are super friendly and I love going there."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been to Which Wich which probably makes me enjoy it that much more! Ventured out from my norm last night and tried the South Philly cheesesteak and I must say it was phenomenal! Their sandwiches are always on point and love how they keep the menu creative!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out, completed my order online (and printed it to take to them).

Stellar sandwich. I mean, a star winked at me when I had my first bite.

I ordered a Turkey Sandwich on wheat with avocado, mayo, light ranch and pesto, mushrooms, onion, lettuce, tomato and cucumber with provolone cheese, sprinkle of pepper. Taste explosion!

The sandwiches are beautifully made with perfect little layers. The bread is SO FRESH and delicious! This place should be on your radar and will not disappoint."}
{"text":"It's Which Wich, not a gourmet sandwich place. It's where you go when nothing is open and you don't care about food or quality."}
{"text":"We had one of these in our neighborhood in Vegas.  So I was excited when I saw that they were opening one in our neighborhood here.  One of the things I love about this place is that you get to write down your order on a bag, so that there's a lesser chance of them getting the order wrong.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/which-wich-scottsdale-4?select=1BjXv4STlKTqIl2LgYpHxw#1BjXv4STlKTqIl2LgYpHxw

I ended up ordering a Regular 7.5\" Grinder w/Chips & Soda, $8.

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I think they make a decent Sandwich here.  I realize there are cheaper Sandwich shops, but Which Wich has their own style and flavor.  Their sauces and toppings are better than average and the Bread is very good.  Overall, it's a pretty good meal.

Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is bad! I waited 18 min for my sandwich which was straight of the menu! I guess I feel ok about it, the guy in front of me waited 31 minutes!"}
{"text":"I love Which Wich but this location got my salad wrong, didn't have the great vibe of others I had been to, and didn't have the personal touch that I have grown to love with the staff member that circulates the lobby to talk to customers.  I will continue to eat at Which Wich - I love it - but I doubt I will head back to this location."}
{"text":"Love this sadwich shop!  So many varieties to choose from, great atmosphere, fun employees!  It's hard to find a sandwich place that has good vegeterian options and their black bean patty is fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recently told me I eat like a college kid.  Well, I guess that may be true, but when you have options like Which Wich out there, I plan to eat this way for the rest of my life.  

This location is just down the street from my house, so I've had the opportunity to visit them on numerous occasions.  I had never been to a Which Wich before moving to the Carolina's, so being a newbie, I was a little discombobulated the first time I tried to order.  They have this odd brown bag concept where you choose an appropriate sandwich bag from the receptacle and then check-off what type of meats, cheeses, and veggies, as well as drinks, cookies, etc., you want for your order.  The staff must have thought I was a little dim at first; I must have stared at the menu for 5-minutes trying to figure everything out.  Fortunately another patron happened by and guided me through the process.  If I had it to do over again, I'd likely just walk to the counter and ask for a little help: My hindsight is 20-20.  They'll help, but as far as this particular location is concerned, they aren't all that motivated to speak up.  

Regarding the food, I have nothing but praise.  I love everything on the menu.  I also have zero complaints about the quality or their efficiency for getting the food prepared in a very timely manner.  Also, they have a great sandwich club that you can register for in order to receive freebies and discounts.  I highly advise you to sign-up.  I got a free large drink on my second visit.  That alone is worth the minute or so it took to register the card.

One negative that really isn't huge, but bugged me a bit concerned a marketing campaign they ran that drew me in for a bite to eat.  I received an email encouraging me to show up on April 2 for National PB&J Day.  Proceeds benefited a good cause so I was hooked. I reposted links to their event all over the internet and encouraged folks to participate.  Unfortunately, when I arrived the staff obviously didn't have a clue that their corporate offices had sent out the email.  Nothing at the store even alluded to the event.  I was a bit disappointed to say the least.  Even worse, they didn't have a special PB&J for adults.  We had to buy a kids meal.  That's not enough for me

I love the location. There is plenty of seating both inside and out, and the food broke da mouth!  I'll keep coming back for the food alone.  5-stars for Food and Location; 3-stars for Service; 4-stars overall."}
{"text":"this location is very close to my work so as soon as I drove by to eat around that plaza I was so excited that Which Wich would be opening. I couldn't find the date of the opening anywhere so I drove by today and it was open :) Love the toasted sandwiches and love that they have a punch card... I get a free sub on my next visit thanks to today's order!! I was getting sick of eating at Subway so I'm pretty excited there is another sub business open now. It wasn't very packed today for a grand opening so I'm thinking not many people know about it yet. Its located right between Chipotle and a Yogurt shop and Pei Wei."}
{"text":"saw this place and decided to try it out.  Was a little thrown off when i walked in but the girl was nice and gave us \"the walk through\" on how it works with writing your order on a bag and checking off the toppings you want.

Good:
bread was awesome, meat seemed pretty good quality and a lot was on my sandwich.  place was open, and clean.  price wasn't more than subway and was a lot better.

Not so good:
ordering was confusing, WAY too many bags to choose from to start.  was almost impossible to figure out the price of anything till after i ordered.  it looks like IKEA threw up inside. for being empty it still took 10 minutes for my food.

Overall i will be back and now that i know a few things i'm sure why next visit will be a lot better"}
{"text":"First thing I noticed was how dirty this place was the glass and floor need cleaned, sandwich just ok, wont return"}
{"text":"The guy that took our order was outside with girlfriend both of which had sweet green hair... she brought the dog inside... then he took our order with his disgusting mustache and beard and then made our sandwiches... it was disgusting to watch! Please skip this location!! Now minimum wage is 10$ an hour hire someone good???? Clean cut like inn and out burger??"}
{"text":"Never waited 10 minutes at the front of the line to be helped then for them to tell me it will be 10 minutes until they start making my sandwich.  It's like they want you to leave.  Strange."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich place since Deli Roma closed . But Which Which really is it's own style. I feel good after I've finished my Which!"}
{"text":"This my first time and last time very disrespectful workers and not very good food I would not recommend coming here"}
{"text":"Yum so many vegan options... Hummus... Avocado... Buffalo sauce... Tons of veggie options.

Also the guy saw we had a dog so he set up a table outside for us. Very nice!"}
{"text":"Yummy subs. I love the whole \"mark it on a bag\" concept. You can tell that the ingredients are 10x better quality than Subway's. 4 stars because the dude making the sandwiches seemed like he hated life."}
{"text":"This place is nothing to write home about.  Food was subpar at best.  I ordered the veggie and I must say the avocado they used was not ripe at all.  It was very chewy.  Gross...  Both myself and my friend had upset stomachs after eating here.  Will not come back."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????
???????????????????????????????????1? ?????????????????????????

??????????????????????

?????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I ordered off of Door Dash. Terrible, terrible, terrible. I ordered the Grinder. They didn't add three of the items that I asked for which are even marked on the bag. Also, the flavor is bland and tastes like cardboard. I ended up just throwing the other half away. I would not recommend AT ALL."}
{"text":"Have to start out by saying yum! I'm your basic turkey on white with mayo, lettuce and tomato girl. If I'm feeling frisky that day give me vinegar, oil and pickles. My fav chain sandwich place is Jersey Mikes, I like their bread and meat. Subway is a NO go and I've been way outdone on Jimmy John's. I've been wanting to try Which Wich because my BFF said it was pretty awesome. She was right. Walk in, get a bag, mark off what u want. Any picky person can be picky here, they'll accommodate you! They have some oddball stuff too for the brave palate. The turkey meat is fresh, Tatar just like Jersey Mike's. I got pickles and they were crisp and super yummy. My friend told me about their house chips and I grabbed a bag of those too. They have a unique flavor...which is a good unique flavor. They come in a bag that seems like they're made in house (as name would suggest) try them! If it's your first time u get a free large drink...that's pretty awesome to me! It comes in a refillable cup which if u bring back u save $.50 cents. Environmental friendly ;)  3 different sizes of sandwiches...I had a small which is 7 inches and only ate half to get full. It was $5.50 which I consider cheap compared to JJ's and Jersey Mikes. You can also create a salad bowl (not an option at JJ's) or a lettuce wrap (not an option at Jersey Mikes). The staff was also super nice and friendly. They great u as soon as u walk in the door and are really fast too. As soon as I fixed my drink my wich was ready. A lot of specials....one day is kids day, a day for medical staff, punch cards, etc."}
{"text":"Love it only reason it's 4 stars is the seating and waiting area are set up very poorly , the food and service are amazing and the staff is great .. Nice job (:"}
{"text":"It is too expensive to eat here. But the sandwich was okay ish. I had a Philly cheesesteak and it didn't really have any flavor :("}
{"text":"Yes, tried for the first time yesterday! I got the turkey sandwich on wheat, OMG their bread is super awesome! I will definitely visit again. I think the idea of check off all your favorite ingredients on the bag is great."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Subway, but after my first time at Which Wich, I will never be the same.  :)  First of all, who of us doesn't like to doodle on paper bags?  The fact that you can select any kind of sandwich combination and use a red Sharpie to create it is just plain fun.  My favorite \"wich\" is Chicken Pesto on a toasted wheat roll with jack cheese, pesto, jalapenos, and oil/vinegar.  AMAZING...everytime.  My boyfriend loves the Hawaiian and it is quite the flavorful sub.  Definitely recommend for a quick and satisfying sandwich!  And don't forget a strawberry shake!  YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"Which Which is really high quality. They probably make the tastiest subs in town (I haven't had Erbert and Gerberts, so I can't say for certain). They definitely have a far better crab meat sub than Subway. The prices are a little higher than I would pay for the amount you get, like the other reviews say. I don't really get subs often enough to care, but if you frequent sub shops it might be enough to deter you.

I would give Which Which a five star, but every time I eat here my stomach gets a litte upset. Every single time. It's really unfortunate, considering how tasty it is. My boyfriend has the same issue and he usually gets the tuna. Neither of us have tried anything other than fish, so maybe it's an issue with that. I wish they would fix whatever the problem is. They're so good I still end up getting a sub every other month or so and dealing with the upset stomach."}
{"text":"Yeah, so I was so sick of sandwich shops.  Like 10 years of Subway commercials?  Good god.  Then came Quizno's which was different for like what, a couple days.  I've been at a pretty hard, yeah I can make that at home, for quite a while.  Then I go into Which Wich.   My god, it took me like 15 minutes to even decide what I wanted there the first time and I've been back like 4 times already.  Everything I've ever had has been great and sometimes I put stupid things on my sandwiches that wouldn't even be good, but still is.  Plus, they got Cheese Wiz!"}
{"text":"Really good fully customizable sandwich. I'm not sure where Mr. Chicken Salad on raisin bread down there was eating, but it wasn't here.  They have literally everything you could want on a sub and you pretty much have to build it yourself."}
{"text":"Nice place! Unlike similar competitors such as Subway or Jersey Mike's, you don't have to tell the person what to put on your sandwich while they're making it. Instead, you pick up a bag (which will become the bag they put your sandwich in) and you mark what you want. For instance, there are spaces on the bag where you can check off what toppings you want. When you're done, you just hand your bag to the cashier, pay, and then wait for your food. 

I ordered an Italian sub and it was absolutely delicious! It was made exactly as I had indicated on the bag. 

Overall, I had a very good experience here. The employees were very polite and the restaurant itself was clean. Just be prepared to pay more than what you would pay at Subway. Each large sub will cost around $12-$15 (not including a side or drink), but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great place, great service, fresh sandwiches. I got the Cuban sandwich with best chocolate oreo shake."}
{"text":"I just had lunch their today(February 27, 18) and the sandwich was great. Also got a gingerbread shake which was awesome,too. Price was good. Customer Service was great too. Love can go to our place in Sun Prairie closest to East of Madison."}
{"text":"Has vegan and vegetarian options. Speedy service and friendly staff. Love the free 7\" by texting them. Got a free cup too!"}
{"text":"Why bother checking all the little boxes on the order form if they ignore what you check? I ordered a \"thank you turkey\" which is supposed to include stuffing and cranberry. That's the whole point of the thank you. It came with neither. It was just plain turkey. Boring. And of course I got it to go so I didn't find out until I got home."}
{"text":"So this was my first time here. Once I figured out how the process of ordering worked, it was really easy. The food was was amazing. I got a vegetarian sub, and it was delicious. 

My friend, Olivia, got a milkshake. I am on somewhat of a diet, but I did try hers and it was really good. It was a nice consistency. 

They are priced a bit higher than subway, but it was definaelty worht the extra bucks."}
{"text":"Love the concept, plus they don't skimp on toppings. We have been a few times and everything has been great."}
{"text":"Attention to detail has been lacking lately. Not everyone wants a warm sub sandwich so you have to ask for it cold. Attention to detail is important since the order sheet has so many options."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I had never been into a which wich before so an employee came out and explained the entire process to me.

You pick what kind of sandwich you want, get the corresponding paper bag, then mark off all the ingredients and sauces you want with a provided marker and take it up to the counter to pay for it. 

They have fantastic options for toppings and sauces and it takes the guesswork out of building a sandwich. No longer do you have to say, no mushrooms, no onions, add avocado, etc etc. 

Your sandwich, your way.

Great flavor and high quality products. Here's a tip, pick the skinny sandwich bread and they take some of the bread out of the middle to save you about 80 calories and make more room for more toppings!"}
{"text":"This sub shop is conveniently located by the woodmans, Costco, and target in Sun Prairie. They offer a reward card so if you plan on coming often, utilize this to earn free subs (who doesn't love free).

The sandwiches are completely customizable. You can either build your own or they have prearranged choices for you. When you walk in, you will go to the wall with all the bags, choose the bag with your meat choice and complete your order on the bag accordingly. You take your filled out bag to the cash register to complete your order.

The staff is always very friendly and it doesn't take long to get your meal. I'm not generally a sub person but I feel they really step it up with all the options they provide to customize your sandwich."}
{"text":"I love its sandwich. Its sandwich is fresh and delicious. You get to choose what you want on your sandwich. There are alot of choices you can choose. I have the tuna and it is good.  My co-worker had the BBQ pull pork and he told me it  was good. They also have the best vanilla shakes. The roast beef and cheese steak are also delicious too."}
{"text":"Been open for a couple days now. I just got the chance... umm.. privilege to eat there today. Wow! Scrumptious sandwiches, with so much to choose from it's great! I chose the cuban pork sandwich, toasted, with mustard, pickle, and swiss. Very, very tasty.

If you buy their cookie, and it's ready first, scarf it down; don't wait! It'll cool off and then won't be soft, warm and gooey anymore.

Their ambiance is energetic, the music is good, and it's truly a bustling place. I'll definitely be back!

Lunchtime weekdays can be hard if not impossible to find a parking spot. Anytime from 11:30-1:00 is prime time over there."}
{"text":"Gross. Really slow service, pricey, and poor quality. Never again. There are much better sammich spots. Actually, I'd rather eat at a gas station."}
{"text":"I used to eat here regularly, but since they took the hummus sandwich of the menu (and out of the app) I rarely go. It's so stupid because they still have hummus, it's just not a bag option anymore. I contacted customer service online and was told I could order a different sandwich and customize it in the notes section. But, given how frequently they would get my sandwich wrong before, it wasn't worth the risk. I got a coupon for a free one recently so I tried it again in person. I had to order an avocado one, hold the avocado and add hummus. It tasted fine, and was made correctly, but I still wouldn't be comfortable ordering it online without looking the employees in they eye to explain what I want. Bring back the hummus sandwich option!"}
{"text":"The ordering was a little confusing, and took me a minute to understand. You have to find which bag station has the sandwich you want and then mark off what you want on it, 

 I really liked the sandwiches. They were very tasty. I had a vegetarian hummus. I ordered a kids pizzawich for the baby. It came with a drink and tiny rice krispy treat (I ate). She really liked it. The bread was easy for her to chew and tasty. My sandwich was really good too. I really like the bread- I think that made the sandwich.

I went a few weeks after it opened and it was still pretty busy. It took a long time to get the sandwich and to order, but that is to be expected.

This is a great addition to the Arrowhead area and I wish it success."}
{"text":"This place have the worst service ever! Two people making sandwiches for two orders and still take them forever. 
I'm not crazy about this place really, no wonder this place is mostly empty during lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"It is my first time come here and order and not realized, what I order was almost 12 dollars to super size and whoaaaa for that price! Ummmm!! It was so good and can't even finish all sandwich so for y'all who come in for first time, get REGULAR sandwich!!!! Not over seek for anything! They good best than subway!!!"}
{"text":"Rehashing what other have said. S.L.O.W. service. I ordered a plain turkey sammie and it took 15 minutes before it was ready. I work in this shopping center and only had 20 minutes to grab a bite. I have no idea what takes so long considering they don't take the order. You just hand them your bag. 

Overall the sammie was pretty good. I ordered a \"skinny wich\" which means they scrape out the excess bread. I like this option a lot. The bread was extra flaky and good, but they put red onions on my sammie which I did not ask for and also hate.... so much that if I ever met an onion in a dark alley would kick it's ass."}
{"text":"Takes me back to Radical Rye - anyone remember that place?  As sandwich joints go, this is a fav - I like the whole ordering process.  The bread is good and the option to heat it, while not unique to WW, is always a plus in my book.  I think the prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"Restaurant was dirty.  Cashier had difficulty making change.  They were out of most chips, cookies, iced tea and root beer.  Won't be going back,"}
{"text":"I was looking for something new in the Solon area and I stumbled across which which. I typically order an Italian sub when trying a new sub spot because its really hard to mess up. I ordered an Italian grinder, you check the toppings you want on your sub (plenty of choices, my girlfriend loved that they would put chips on if selected). The service was OK, price was good, and the sub was good. I wasn't blown away by anything however I will definitely go back if I'm in the area looking for a quick and affordable bite to eat."}
{"text":"Which Wich is your typical sandwich shop - no more, no less.  However, it's not the best sandwich I have ever eaten...

Pluses:  There is a wide selection of meats and toppings, and are of a higher quality than a place like Subway.  The bread is fresh baked, but there are only 2 options - white or wheat.  

Negatives:  While well prepared, the taste was just not as good as I hoped.  It's on par with Subway to me.  Nothing that knocked me over.  

I fancy myself a chip connoisseur and Which Wich has house-made chips.  Unfortunately, they were on par with Ruffles to me.  Nothing special, a very, very small bag of them and something I would not order again. 

Verdict: While I had been tempted to stop by Which Wich for quite some time, I really could have waited longer.  I probably will not be stopping back there again, given there are better options to getting a similar sandwich."}
{"text":"I feel like an idiot for coming here. Sorry subway. You have to figure out how to order and it's not the clearest thing in the world. You pick a paper bag off the wall with your chosen meat and then fill in circles of what you want. And then you wait forever while they prepare it.  All the tables were dirty, so even that wasn't pleasant. They have the same stuff subway does and charge you a little more. And it's not as good. I don't see the point at all."}
{"text":"Went around 5:30 (not busy at all) and got a toasted club sandwich. Service was friendly and the sandwich was great. And they have Mr. Pibb. (Sorry, Pibb Xtra) Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Been here a few times since my last review. I am quickly losing interest as my last couple of subs have been very lackluster. I usually order the buffalo chicken sub on white bread with American cheese toasted. Sometimes I get it with spicy ranch. 

The last time that I ordered this sub it came drowning in buffalo sauce with maybe four slices of meat. The meat to sauce ratio was horrible. I went out on a limb on another visit and ordered the roast beef French dip. The roast beef was bad. It tasted old and had that oil spill look to it that old roast beef sometimes gets. I have had good and bad experiences here. Lately it has been bad. I really wanted to like this place. I like the idea but the consistency is not in place. I hope that this location can improve.

Which Wich maybe has one chance to win me back. That is all I am giving them."}
{"text":"Solid choice when you want something specific (the have so many choices it's ridiculous), and quick. You can place your order online, and by the time you get there, it's probably going to be ready. Very nice if you have a short window for breaks, or are in a crunch for time.

I docked a star though, because I feel like the protein portions are usually lacking. Doubling your meat on the sandwich is definitely worth it.

If there's one reason I keep coming back though, it's the banana chocolate shakes. Holy crap."}
{"text":"Love the concept, sandwich options and quick service...  For all of you complaining about how long it took to get your sandwich, keep in mind that demand is high and they just opened.  Give them a few weeks to get settled before ripping the new business a new one."}
{"text":"I ordered a vegan Sandwich avocados hummus etc and it was delicious !!! The portions were generous to!!
The service was decent to . I highly recommend trying it out . They have a huge variety !"}
{"text":"Which Which's store is like a grimy 5 year old: dirty  and sticky.  We've been to this location a few times and it has been a mess each time, from the table tops not being clean to food on the floor to even the glass doors being covered in smeared food finger/hand prints.  Oh, and they are ALWAYS out of napkins (i.e. paper towels).  What gives?

I can't speak for other locations, but this one needs to clean up its act.

If not for the dirty store, I would probably give 4 stars."}
{"text":"Which Wich, you never fail me! Today I went to visit you all for lunch with a group of about 25 of my students after a field trip. We called ahead to let them know they were coming, so they were prepared. They made everyone's sandwiches so quickly and were extremely respectful of our students and never seemed to get annoyed at them for any reason. They were efficient and all my students were satisfied with their sandwiches and milkshakes. After all our students went through the line, someone from the restaurant came around to each table (kids and chaperones) to check if everything was okay and if they could get them anything. I was super impressed with that. They even checked with us to see about when we would be back with another group on Thursday. They are supposed to have an audit that day, but never discouraged our group of teenagers from coming in. 

On top of that, my sandwich was awesome!!! I had the club and I added fried onions and spinach, and it was one of the best sandwiches I had. I was impressed the quality was the same as if I would have gone at any other time. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"So slow to get our order. And absolutely no customer service or interaction. Not a greeting, hope like the food when finally was prepared, thanks for coming when we were done 

Pricey so so food and wait staff that does not want to be there. Not for us evere again."}
{"text":"Periodically my wife orders online from Which Wich. I went down to pick it up, about 20 min after she ordered it. They hadn't even begun making our order because \"the online system is down\". So they had to print out the email and start from there. 10 minutes later the man behind the counter hands me the bag and I head out. I get home and discover it's the wrong order. 
They actually called before I was able to and my wife brought back the incorrect order. 
Then when she got there, they started making our food, so she sat around for 10 min. 
To add insult on top of injury they never even offered to refund our money, just a sincere apology from the cashier. Obviously, their system is still in disarray..."}
{"text":"Came here last minute to get to-go food and my husband & I decided to try this place. I wasn't hungry so I ordered the vanilla Oreo milkshake and brownie. I was amazed by the brownie since overcooking it could mean eating a dry flour block, but it was very moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside. My husband had the meatball sandwich and he seem to like it. 

Customer service is good, the woman took it upon herself to describe the ordering  process for us since she could tell that we are new to the place. The atmosphere of the place is mellow and very nice. I would try coming back again when I want to eat their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Recluses, the timid, those studying to be a mime should rejoice! Cause you don't actually have to verbally say anything to place an order here.

Your first time here may feel slightly overwhelming. I looked so lost by the sea of brown paper bags to pick from that someone actually came over to help me. But what you do is grab a bag, fill in the bubbles of what you what on your sandwich. Hand it to the cashier and voila a sandwich is in the bag a minute later. 

For the most part the additions that you can get to your sandwich are free. So you could potentially end up with a massive sandwich. Things like double cheese and avocado were extra. I would say it is a decent sandwich that they make here. Nothing that I would seek out but not a shop I wouldn't stop by again if I was hungry and craving a which."}
{"text":"Eating the meatball grinder special right now (awesome) and splitting a large chocolate Oreo shake (also delicious) with my daughter. Really, really good. They are winning me over. Becoming a regular here."}
{"text":"All I can say is GENIUS.  The customer is what slows down the ordering process and by having it all at your disposable this place is pretty quick and tasty.  The portion sizes are bit smaller than I'm used to but personally I think they are the Subway sinker.  I kind of like to look at this place as a more efficient and tastier Subway.  I've been here several times and I'm slowly working down the menu.  My personal fav thus far would have to be the gyro special.  I work in the area so I'll be here quite a bit!"}
{"text":"This place is hand down friendly and food is just fresh and great! I work nearby and I come all the time for lunch and sometimes snacks. I have to say, they've never disappointed me in food quality and the services. I highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"It is ridiculous the variety that this place offers. For someone who has never been, its almost overwhelming. Even with all the variety, this place is just okay to me. There is nothing that really stands out as better than or different than any other sandwich shop except for the way you order. 

Parking can be difficult during busy times but usually its fairly easy. 

I went on a nice Sunday afternoon and the place was packed. It took  about 10 mins to get our order once we had placed it. They had a few tables outside for people to sit but they were all full so we walked down to the courtyard that is right on park rd."}
{"text":"Used to go there back in high school. I thought it was pretty good back then but realized I'd rather go to jersey mike's to get a good sub. It's a cool concept where you go pick the general type of sandwich you want, grab the specific paper bag and then you check off your condiments and other veggies you want on it. Cool idea but the food just isn't that spectacular. Also they don't brew their own tea so that's a bummer. Not worth your time."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Got the 'Thank You Turkey' and it was very good. The 10\" was more than enough and my husband and I could have very easily shared a super. Only change I would have made was to have the cranberry sauce a little more spread throughout the sandwich, but it's hard to do. The staff was very helpful and the food came out in a timely manner. Will be back."}
{"text":"I love which wich soOoOoOOoo much but I just have to review how sad I am about this location at night. If I go there after 6 pm I get the worst service, and the sandwich isn't made well either. It's such a disappointment :("}
{"text":"I had the most wonderful experience at wich wich last night. The gal who took our order was so pleasant! I was completely fused about the way to order and she so kindly walked me through it. She was beyond sweet and helpful.  I believe her name is Chris. The vegetarian sandwich, homemade chips and strawberry shake was amazing!"}
{"text":"Drove by and decided to try this place out, so glad we did. We loved the unique way to select your sandwich. Several of GOOD vegetarian options, including a black bean patty. Unparalleled topping choices, I definitely recommend it over other sandwich shops. The staff was friendly and the restaurantvwas clean, even during a busy weekend lunch rush."}
{"text":"This might shock you, but I don't like Subway and I don't like places that are in a similar vein. Blimpie's - no, thanks. Quizno's - nope. Which Wich - meh. The only redeemable factor about Which Wich is that they have milkshakes, really inexpensive milkshakes. Try $2.75 for a small, which is a great price compared to other places that sell shakes. My husband and I received a few giftcards for Which Wich and now we can buy hundreds of milkshakes. If we didn't receive the giftcards, we wouldn't go to Which Wich otherwise. 

We have had sandwiches and salads from here, due to business lunches, but they are pretty mediocre. The French Dip was decent but even Quizno's has a better French Dip. I do like that they have plenty of vegetarian options - which include pesto and hummus. Their pesto is decent; I liked it on my pesto, mozzarella, and tomato sandwich. 

However, the two times I've ate here, they've messed up my order. The first, I placed an order online for pickup and they forgot the sauce that comes with the French Dip and they forgot the chips I ordered. The second time, I ordered a Chocolate Malt Shake and they forgot the malt. Luckily, they did correct these situations once brought to their attention. However, for a place that basically prides themselves on made-to-order entrees, they need to get it together.

I'll be back, giftcard in hand, but when that baby runs out... probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Love that this place is veggie friendly.  I always get the black bean patty with a ton of add-ons, and it's really good.  Service was quick, you decide what you want, and it's made to order right there.

It's a bit more expensive than, say, Subway, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"If you like Quizno's, you'll like Which Wich. The food is nearly indistinguishable, but the order process of writing on the bags is fun. 

Nothing too exciting, but totally decent food that hits the spot when you're in the mood for a quick sub and chips."}
{"text":"I was amazed by this place for two reasons. The first was the efficiency. I walked in in the middle of lunch hour on a Friday and the place was completely packed to the brim. I went though their fairly odd ordering system (involving choosing a paper bag with a certain number on it and then marking the bag with ingredient choices), paid and then waited. The sandwiches were flying off the assembly line, and within 5 minutes they must have gone through 20-30 subs. I was blown away-- I had figured I would be waiting for 30 minutes at least, and they easily got my sandwich made in under 10 minutes.
The other amazing piece was the quality of the sandwich. Granted, I paid for it (over $10 for a medium sandwich), but the vegetarian black bean patty was phenomenal. Lots of ingredients, no stinginess, and everything very fresh. And it was a ton of food. I think I have a new favorite sandwich shop in town."}
{"text":"I probably didn't pick the right item...  I got the gyro and wasn't impressed.  The only thing impressive was the size.  It was sadly very lacking in flavor. 

Extra star for the fact that I had their roast beef sandwich as an Ironman Arizona volunteer and that one was good. But nothing I would write home about."}
{"text":"Service here had gone down hill the last several times, to the point I walked out today without ordering. I think they need a new focus on management and customer service"}
{"text":"Me and my dad wanted to go to a restaurant nearby but I had the hours wrong and I wanted to give Which Which a try. My sandwich was good, an average sub sandwich. They didn't have music playing or a tv, the place was really clean. I really liked the process of ordering."}
{"text":"Have tried the online ordering twice, now.  Both times with prompting from their emails which are mostly spam but every now and again will contain an offer (e.g., free chips if you come and order in person--lame!).

I do like the online ordering process.  You can pick a favorite (no customization) or order what you like with unlimited veggie toppings, pay online, then go to the FAR RIGHT of the registers when you arrive to pick up your order.  

They're not very organized about the order pick-up, but so far it's been quick.  They also don't do a good job about giving you napkins, fork/knife, etc., so be sure to ask for that when you are at the counter.  It's not available in the condiments/drinks area.

Again, the rewards program isn't all that much more than a bag of chips.  But the online ordering system is nice, the whole process is quick, and the sandwiches are relatively cheap.  For, you know, Uptown."}
{"text":"You gotta love the wich! The food is always good and fresh. Lunch can be a frenzy bc it's packed! Generally worth the wait, though."}
{"text":"Which Wich offers up a neat little concept where you pick your sandwich bag, label what you want on it with a Sharpie, and hand it over to the clerk to have it made as you pay. It's a lot slower (and better) than Subway; slower (and not as good) as Capriotti's; slower  (and slightly better) than Cousins; much faster than (and about the same as) Firehouse. I like that that you can \"skinny\" your 'wich (less bread) and add a multitude of condiments and myriad meats, cheeses and veggies. That you complete your order using the sandwich bag means you can create a complicated masterpiece that, in theory, won't get lost in translation. The sandwich-makers read the bag, make your 'wich and place it on the counter as they call your name when it's ready. So simple, yet a unique way to deliver a sammie. I like it."}
{"text":"I really like the ordering concept and the huge selection of things that you can get.

It's difficult to pull off having so many options. For starters, the unpopular options can be almost always expired/gone bad at some places (That's you, Subway!). It can be daunting to go through the long list, trying to decide what you want from a menu that you could not read until you were at the ordering station (That's you, Potbelly!). I don't want to hold everyone up! Or worse, you could have a place with loads of options for toppings, and then not tell anyone what they are (That's you, Culvers!).

It's nice to have so many choices, where you can casually stand to the side, out of the way, and select them at your leisure. And then it's good to have all of those ingredients be fresh.

Their menu also has quite a few pre-arranged sandwich recipes for the \"I like other people to make to make all my decisions for me\" crowd."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches but price point too high.  Good homemade chips.  Slow on delivery and meat is mediocre"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches but they need more workers. It's kind if ridiculous how long you wait for a sandwich place."}
{"text":"Updating my review for Which Wich. 

Yes, the prices are too high.  Yes, it takes too long to get your sandwich. (This has nothing to do with the staff, by the way.  It is entirely due to the slowest toaster oven in the industry).  No, this will never be a great sandwich.

But the staff here really goes above and beyond what I'd expect from a restaurant at this price point, and I think that deserves an extra star.

(Also, their gyro was unexpectedly awesome.  Too bad it was only a monthly special.)"}
{"text":"My first taste of WW was around the Denver, CO area. Great 'build it yourself' concept. Such an easy step process: grab a paper sack with your sandwich \"family\" label (i.e.; turkey, chicken, veggie, etc.), pick up a red Sharpie and start selecting all the goods. It's like taking a 4th grade test- fill in the bubbles to select your sandwich toppings, bread (pick toasted!), and size.

The buffalo chicken is awesome. The bread deserves to be toasted. Add hummus to your 'wich for a great flavor. I've been to many sub shops (chain and local)-- WW is at the top for me. I've been to 3 separate locations (NC, AZ, CO) and they are all clean, with friendly staff.

Prices are reasonable- expect to pay around $10 for a medium 'wich, chips and a soda. Try the house chips if salt-n-pepper wavy potato chips suit you. The store also offers deserts (rice krispie, brownie, cookie), and a variety of milkshakes. Coke products.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place in Austin ALL THE TIME! I love there skinny vegetarian sandwich! Even in the lunch hour the service was good and the people had smiles on their faces!"}
{"text":"This location is the absolute worst! I swear I try so hard to let things slide because this is the closest thing to my job that is pretty cheap and reasonable in price. 

They can't handle the lunch rush and have no type of team work behind the register. They're always out of certain condiments, meats and have even been out of bread. Yes I can understand this happens, but here it happens too much. My order is almost never prepared correctly which I don't get how they can still mess my order up when all they have to do is follow little checked boxes?

The customer service is to be desired. There is really only one girl who is tall with glasses that is actually nice. Everyone else doesn't really care.

The food is fine when it's made correctly the only thing I hate is how they use their gloved hands or a spatula to slide the orders accords the wire. The same hands and spatula used to serve the food touching a wire and clips they probably never clean... gross

Try the shakes though, they are superb."}
{"text":"They are not Ike's in Foster City CA, but pretty close and if you double meat it, gets closer. 
The system is very easy and convenient and all tastes very good. Definitely recommend double cheese on all."}
{"text":"Good stuff! Bread was not overpowering... Nice and crispy on outside and just enough \"fluff\" on inside...always a good sign when you can enjoy what's inside the sandwich! I had the Grinder and my daughter had the chicken..both sandwiches were delicious! Prices are decent...clean restaurant and friendly workers. Will be back."}
{"text":"My mom and I visited yesterday while shopping in the area.  I ordered the Ultimate BLT.  The bread, bacon, and toppings were all good.  My mom ordered the Cobb Salad wrap.  I took a bite and thought it was pretty tasty; she enjoyed it, too.  We also ordered chips, carrot cake and birthday cake.  The cake was moist and tasted really good, too.  One of the employees came over to show us how to order and explain the menu.  The restaurant was clean and we got our food pretty quickly.  The only complaint is that is was $27 for our order, a lot for two people ordering fast food."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich from here and was pleasantly surprised how their operation works.

A little back-story: I was planning to go to the grocery store, but didn't want to go hungry and buy everything in sight, so I had originally wanted to grab a bite somewhere around Trader Joe's in the Metropolitan.  After almost dying in the parking deck for a spot, I was planning to walk to Chipotle when I saw this option and decided to give it a try.

So you walk in and it was fairly slow.  I was expecting a counter... maybe like subway where you go down the line and pick your toppings and what-not, but this was a bit different.  There are stands of brown bags and you go to the number kiosk that you want your sandwich to be based off of.  All the toppings you could ever want with that sandwich are listed and you take a sharpie and bubble in which toppings you want.  Pretty darn awesome.

When you are done taking your \"standardized test\" minus the number two pencils... hand the bag over to the cashier and she will ring it up.  After a couple of moments, (depending on what you ordered) the sandwich appears in the bag that you had marked on.  Genius!

I forgot all the toppings I had put on my sandwich but I got a hot pesto chicken sandwich [base] and it was pretty tasty.  The staff was super nice and also offered to help if I had any questions - they are probably nice cause they don't have to ask the same question(s) to everyone that comes in (whether it be \"hot, medium, mild salsa\", or \"what else would you like....\"... everything is written down on the bag and you save your breath or having to repeat yourself.  Happiness all around!"}
{"text":"Which Wich is like a cross between Subway and Quiznos except the ordering process is \"make your own sub\" by checking options on the bag your sub will come in.  They customize your sandwich and if you want it toasted it goes into a conveyer belt oven like at Quiznos.

My first experience with Which Wich was ok.  I didn't realize until after I was done filling out my club bag that there were other options.  Well the club will do for now.

I handed my bag to the cashier, paid and grabbed my drink and waited in the cheap, uncomfortable furniture.  Seriously, next time go to IKEA and get your furniture.  

The sandwich came out and it was a bit salty...I think it was the bacon which I didn't order.  Also the bacon was bacon pieces, not strips.  I didn't really like that either.

Overall it's not a bad place and it certainly is an interesting idea but I'd rather see a Lenny's or Jersey Mike's pop up in this area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. 2 tips: 1. wipe off the straws (they have some weird powder on them) and 2. join the text club."}
{"text":"I first experienced Which Wich in Texas. It was an instant hit with me. I was pleasantly surprised to see it in Charlotte. 

It has tasty sandwiches and lots of choices too. And just the way you want it. You pick a brown bag that accompanies the type of meat that you want and proceed to use a sharpie to fill in the meat, cheese, toppings and spread. just the way you want it and in a cool way. They also have chips, cookies, rice krispy treats and shakes. 

The sandwiches are very tasty and you can get a combo meal. They even do a punch card for frequent members for a free sub. 

This one is closer to home so I tend to go to this one more often. Staff is great here too and it's not as busy as the one in Metro. Def recommend!!!"}

Prices are reasonable and the sandwiches are awesome. You definitely need to stop by and order a sandwich here."}
{"text":"I love this place they have the best sandwiches; however, this location on this particular night struggled with their customer service. This post is for a manager to see, feel free to contact me at (760)861-1853 and I would be glad to change my review. Thanks"}
{"text":"Really good sandwiches with thousands of options.  My wife and I have been here a couple times, and each time I am pleasantly surprised with what I get.  The truth is though, with so many options, it can be hard to decide on what might make a good combination.  I've enjoyed their R&D special sandwiches as well as some of their vegetarian options, but I look forward to trying something different each time we go.  It also can get a little pricey, so don't consider it in the same range as Subway/Jimmy Johns.  It's better quality, and more expensive as a result.

Their bread is real (looking at you Subway), their ingredients are fresh, and we'll be back every time we're in the mood for sub sandwiches.  No other sandwich place needed."}
{"text":"Great place to have sandwich  ... People bored to subway have to try  .. U will love it.. I tried black bean patty.. 
Which wich do you want ?"}
{"text":"Ordering is ok if your not with kids. Its over complicated.  Its expensive and not worth the time and effort. My sons hated it. Portions for kids sandwich is small. This location is just small. The whole experince made me want to drink!"}
{"text":"I had to wait way too long for my food, but that's not why I'm complaining. They told us (after I ordered) that someone's order was messed up and they were short staffed. So the wait was explained. Since it took so long to get my food I had to bring it back to work and eat at my desk. I opened the wrap and it was a disaster. It had so much jalapeno hummus that it was inedible. I paid $11 for an inedible wrap and ate nothing for lunch. Once sharing this story with my co-workers I was advised that their past experiences at Which Wich have been the same as mine and they won't eat there. I will not be returning to this restaurant, which is a bummer because they had an opportunity to make a really healthful, delicious wrap. I was understanding that they had a problem with an order and were short staffed, however, the quality of the product they are selling should not decrease, unless they are willing to decrease the charge."}
{"text":"OK the three stars is just for the location. So basically everything I say is just reviewing this particular store. I have finally decided to introduce my husband to eating here because my first experience at another location was awesome. First we walked in and it was empty there were a few workers there and then after a minute or so we were finally greeted and walked through with the directions on how to order. We finally decided what we wanted we both ordered the banh mi Vietnamese style sandwich. That was actually pretty good. My son ordered a breakfast sandwich I understand that you make it how you want it...but...first his sandwich took 15 minutes to make, second egg patties were disgustingly cold. There were like 6 sausage patties and omg too hot. Maybe they thought the sausage was going to cook the egg. I am very disappointed because these sandwiches are expensive.  My son didn't even finish and his dad told him to throw it I wanted to return it but oh well. My son then ordered a banana milkshake to be happy. He was happy with that after another 15 minutes of waiting. This location is not I. My area and I will not go back. Just a reminder to the sandwich makers at this location please check the temperature of your eggs before serving..."}
{"text":"Which Wich has become one of my husband's favorite stops on road trips for lunch.  The concept is relatively simple - you decide what your primary ingredient (type of meat, veggie) will be, grab the bag that matches your choice, and check off sandwich options... like type of bread, cheese, and fillings.

With all sorts of combinations, you could probably eat here many times and never have the same thing twice.  The sandwiches were pretty tasty, although they were somewhat expensive.  I'd eat here again next time we're passing through."}
{"text":"I've been to Which Which at Westgate a few times, first time in Arrowhead location. We were craving a good sandwich and lucky we found this location. A little hidden, next to 5 guys and behind Paradise. Ordered a large buffalo chicken with double meat and shared. Big enough for the both of us and left us full. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwich! Finally I found a place that beats subway, jimmy john, and firehouse sub. Their bread is so soft and fresh. Great choices for vegetarian as well. Even better for deaf peeps because they provide a brown bag where you check the ingredients yourself and not having to ask for a paper and pen to comminicate. That's the best part about this place. Vegetarian friendly and deaf friendly are the huge bonus. They tasted extremely good and fresh! Definitely will come back to it. Oh it's also Gluten Free friendly since it does give you the option to go for bowl or lettuce wrap it up. Go and check this place out! Staffs are friendly!"}
{"text":"Finally have a great location in arrowhead next door to five guys. Love the pastrami toasted with pepper jack cheese spicy mayo, deli mustard, and all the fixings!  People still need to figure out how to order here but at least they stay out of the way until they figure it out.  Soon we will expect this kind of ordering everywhere!  Love Which Wich and glad to see them here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich shops, very small inside but clean and great for a quick casual sandwich to go.  If you have not gone here yet, please get it done.  We need more of these franchises in the city.  They toast the sandwich in a way that makes it taste fantastic and the quick way to order is the best ever.  I would like to create another great restaurant with this same idea maybe with hamburgers or something.  It makes it quick to just grab the bag with the meat you like and start using a marker to write what you want on the sandwich so that it does not slow them down.  This is helpful to keep the annoyingly slow people out of your way....if you are not ready to order, MOVE OVER!  Cant say enough about which wich except I love the hot pastrami sandwich with all my favorite fixings.  I did not care for the turkey sandwich that I created here so I stick with what is good.  The first location I have ever been to was in Westgate near the Cardinals stadium."}
{"text":"Which Wich is my absolute favorite sub sandwich place. You select the items you want and then they make it. I like that they offer a lettucewich too. So many choices! They are not always the fastest, especially when it's busy. However, when you compare them to other sandwich chains that are \"fast food\" I feel that the quality and amount of meat you get is much better and more of it!"}
{"text":"Our favorite which wich!! It's a chain, and they are all pretty consistent but this one makes the best, softest cookies! Make sure to sign up for their rewards program, it's free and you get free stuff!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on a whim and were very satisfied & impressed. The staff members were very helpful and friendly. Also the menu is huge and completely customizable.  I love that they have classic hot sandwiches like Philly cheese steak, meatball grinders, and gyros. This isn't your average sub shop. I couldn't begin to finish the gyro I got but it was amazing."}
{"text":"Love the concept of this eatery! Growing up in Australia we had a thing called tuck shop at school. We would write on a paper sandwich bag what we wanted hand it in in the morning & our order would be ready for us at lunch time. Which Wich is MUCH better though as the options seem endless. It was great for my daughter who loves odd combinations .... I could just tick the boxes of ingredients I wanted added without any questions asked ;-) 

The staff at this location are great, actually even the customers are too as the person in line in front of us gave us a free souvenir drink cup with free drink voucher. 

We tried one sandwich from the breakfast options (sausage & egg) & one from the traditional sandwich options (gyros & tzatziki). Both were delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really like this place always friendly lady's and really good food. My fav is the hula but I have had a few choices and they are all very good.  I will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"I come here every once in a while.  With that said I am starting a decent collection of the cups at home. Lol! I very happy with the service and the food here. Wonderful staff. Fast and friendly. I will definitely keep coming back. It was busy when I got here but it was still very fast and efficient and I got exactly what I ordered. Both the young lady at the front taking the money and the one that handed me the sandwich were very sweet and friendly! Thank you for making me a delicious sandwich!"}
{"text":"THE BEST sandwich. Love how I can build my own sandwich with so many options - nothing like other sub shops.  I had Italian and added pesto, cokeslow, veggies, etc. It became huge but super delicious. 7-icher kept me well fed!  Hands down must try!!!"}
{"text":"Another sandwich shop.  For me the ordering by drawing on a bag with a dry marker is unappealing.  There isn't an effective way to order things that aren't quantized on the bag.  If you want extra something you don't really have that option.  The size of the bag also indicates you aren't getting a large sandwich.

It takes skill to have crisp and not overly wet lettuce, this skill was lacking at Which Wich.  To me this is crucial, I don't want mayonnaise water leaking onto my face and hands from my too wet sandwich.

Flavor - I like the savory and not the sweet.  The Italian sandwich here is too sweet for me and not enough savory.   For me that is the litmus test, how well you handle your Italian sandwich.  I go all out on toppings too, this gives me a feel for how well a place is run.  You can easily make a meat and bread sandwich, but having ten vegetable toppings is a lot more involved and that justifies going out for a sandwich.

In conclusion - I would rather eat at one of the other sandwich chains.  This place doesn't make anything better in my opinion and only as a  novelty would I go here.  Sandwiches aren't novel so you do the math."}
{"text":"I want to say thank you to the mgmt staff here because they have implemented great customer service. I ordered a vegetarian sandwich during peak lunch hours and asked for the gloves to be changed and knives to cleaned so there isn't any meat touching the veg sandwich.  They did even better by making it on the back line where there is no meat! Because of that I enjoyed my sandwich thoroughly!!!!! Thank you Which Wich for providing great training and customer service."}
{"text":"I love Which Wich, but don't think I'll be returning to this location anytime soon. The staff don't seem to have a clue what's going on and don't seem to care about their jobs at all. I've never waited as long as I have today for one turkey sandwich and not many people in front of me. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I probably won't return. I've been noticing these chains popping up all over the Dane County area and decided to stop by for lunch with a co worker while I was in Sun Prairie.

What I like is that as soon as you walk in, you're greeted by someone who helped you with the process if you're a first timer. This is very different from other sandwich places. You go up to a station where all of their sandwiches are written in bags. So if you want a turkey sandwich, you crab the brown paper bag that has written in the back all of the turkey options they have. They do the same for beef, tuna, veggie, chicken, etc. You grab the bag of the sandwich you want and on the bag, you mark with a provided sharpie all of the toppings you want. This is a really neat idea. I liked the selection process. When you've marked your bag with all of your toppings, which they do provided a lot of choices I must admit, you take the bag to the register to pay and the bag is sent to sandwich artist. They put the finished sandwich in the same bag with your selections. Again, very cool idea. When're sandwich is done, they call you by name. There is a place on the bag for you to put your name down. 


However, they are overpriced for their quality of food. You get to pick from three different bread sizes, 6, 10.5 and 14 inches. For a 10.5 inch, it's $8.25 if you don't add toppings that are priced extra.   The sandwich was just OK. Nothing special. They gave me the wrong mustard but it wasn't a huge deal. My biggest issue is that there isn't any combo special. At least that is not what was told to me. For a 10.5 inch sandwich with not extra priced toppings and a small bag of chips, it was over $10. Had I added a pop, I would have been close to $12. It's a lot of money for a sandwich that's very basic and some chips. If the sandwiches were gourmet or other products were locally made, I totally could see the justification of price. However, the sandwich was just basic.  I prefer Quiznos or Pot Bellys over Which Wich to be honest. I had a lot of toppings on mines, but my sandwich was overwhelmed with mayor and horseradish. I couldn't even taste the other toppings. 

Doubtful i'd return. They aren't  terribly bad but they are far from greatness. The experience of picking your sandwich is cool but that's really the only positive I have from my first time experience. I can at least day I tried it and seen what they had to offer. Now I know and I won't be returning. I've had better sandwiches elsewhere."}
{"text":"Definitely not Jimmy John's! Kind of disappointed. I had the lettucewich, but it wasn't the best.  Fell apart before I could even dig in. I've not ever had a lettucewich that was this bad. They forgot a few of my add-ins. I came on a weekday afternoon, and the place was practically empty, however it took about 10 minutes to get my order. Not a fan of Which Wich."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try out this place however it was fairly disappointing.  There is a lot of sandwiches to choose from however the process to pick out your meal is rather confusing for a first timer.  Each of our sandwiches were tasty yet the toppings were skimpy and there is way to much bread."}
{"text":"Very confusing if it's your first time. You walk in to see a menu with no instructions. You quickly figure out that you need a bad to order anything. All of the bags are marked, except for my order. What I wanted did not have a bag. So I went up to the cashier to order my gyro. The rude and VERY unhelpful cashier (User: Cash741) tells me I need a bag. I tell her there is no bag marked for gyro and she sighs and says I need a favorites bag or something. Anyway, the point is that the menu is not clear and the process only slows me down from ordering what I want.

When I get the gyro, it is clear they added too much sour cream/sauce because it's all over the place. When I take my first bite, I understand why. The meat has very little seasoning. You can get a better gyro pretty much anywhere other than this place. Very, very mediocre.

All in all, I could not wait to leave the place. They had 5 workers and I was the only person in line. You'd think one of the 5 workers could have been out there assisting me, and later, other new customers through the confusing process of how to order. I saw four other customers struggling the way I did and not one of the 5 assisted them.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Which Wich used to be my favorite \"alternative sandwich shop\". Jimmy Johns is my favorite but Which Wich used to be a great alternative. I just never went to Which Wich if I couldn't afford to wait.....a long time. It does take forever, no matter how many customers are in the store. But, it was always worth it. My favorite was the TurkeyWich - a turkey sub with coleslaw and 1000 island dressing, which I then added crispy onion strings to. But I haven't been back for about 6 months or so. And something happened - either with all Which Wich's, or just this location. It's not nearly as good as it used to be. I'm trying to be nice by not giving it a 1-star because the food was still decent, but not anything like it used to be. Oddly enough, one of the biggest things that has changed is the employees. They used to be friendly and helpful. Not so yesterday. You know when you walk in to a place to eat and almost instantly regret you came in because of the host/server? That was me yesterday and I should have walked out. There was only 1 other customer in the store and she already had her food. The 2 employees were talking at a table and obviously I interrupted a great conversation because they both groaned as they saw me and one shook her head as she slowly went back to the register. Ok, so they could have been groaning and shaking their heads about something else, but the timing made it feel like it was directed at me. I tried to act very nice, filled out my card and remember, I only asked for 1 additional add-on, which are all free. So it wasn't like I had a difficult order. Barely speaking, she took my order and I paid. I was ok with this because at least the sandwiches are amazing...right? It took just as long as I remember it and I go get my sub. I open it and the bread looks different. It's not toasted, the top looks like it's not cooked all the way either. Weird. I take a bite, and no meat. So I open up the sub and there are 2 big lumps of turkey. She hadn't bothered to spread it out over the bun at all. Ok, no big deal, I use a fork to spread it around. Then I notice the 3 - seriously 3 small crispy onion strings. That's it. Not spread over the sandwich - just 3 little crispies on one end. I was so dissapointed while eating but no way was I going to take it back and ask for another. I walked out sad, realizing that I would never go back to one of my favorite sandwich shops. Honestly though, I feel like this is what happens when a restaurant gets popular, the owners change things to save money. And the product and service just go downhill. I'm hopeful that this was an isolated experience and it was all because of one less-than-stellar employee (the same girl took my order and made the sandwich) and possibly if I go back, it will be different. But at this point I'm not willing to spend the money or time to go back and see if that's the case."}
{"text":"I'm a fan.mmfirst time to any Which Wich.  Interesting concept.  I walked in and was stumped.  What to do?  How to order?  A friendly staffer came over and helped me out.  Once I figured it out it was easy.  Sandwich came out just as I wanted.  I was with two others and they were happy as well.  Pretty quick, great selection of stuff.  Meat and vegetables were high quality, bread was really good.

Place had a good crowd in it too.  I went in for the Bahn Mi sandwich, as I had seen a sign outside the business a few weeks before.  Turns out this was a rotational item and no longer available.  My Italian sandwich was great though.  I will return, and will recommend.  A great alternative to Subway, or just a place for a quick great custom sandwich."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place only has 6 reviews when it has been open 3 or 4 months already. I stopped in today for lunch and the place was packed but most people take theirs to go. Basically, it's a sandwich shop, with similar options to Subway (tastes much better) but a totally different ordering system.

First you pick up a brown paper bag; the bags are all labeled according to the category of sandwich you are going to get (which more or less is based on the type of meat). Then you mark on the bag with the sharpie provided what type of bread and size you want, toppings and condiments, whether you'd like it toasted or cold, etc. Then you hand the bag to the guy at the register, grab chips and a drink cup, and pay for your food. The bag goes to the folks making your food and when your sandwich is done they call out your name and you come to the counter and get it. Oh, yeah, forgot to mention don't forget to put your name on your bag. The spot for your name is at the very bottom and it is easy to miss. It actually helps if you put your initials or some kind of mark on the back of the back so you can see it making it's way down the line and then you'll know when you are next. They actually have a wall of bags with some cool drawings that people have made on their bags. Other than that, the restaurant itself is your basic fast food ambiance. Nothing too special. They do have a couple of small tables outside on Mill Ave so that is cool.

Plus, it's only a short walk to Tempe Beach Park so grab some food and get out and enjoy a picnic in the sunshine!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service takes forever!! I literally waited 25?minutes for my food when it was not busy at all."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp sandwich special, taste was fine. But portion was small and the price was too high."}
{"text":"We came here on 'National Sandwich Day' which was also promoted by them.
We waited for 25 minutes and there were maybe 4 people ahead of us. More people came for lunch and it got worse as a crowd of us waited and waited and waited. The crowd became restless and frustrated. One lady we were talking to went to the counter and asked where she was in line. The 'manager' outright told her they needed to put Uber Eats and all the delivery customers ahead of us. She was outraged as well as the rest of us were and asked for a refund. The employee offered nothing in addition to her refund and for her inconvenience so we did not even bother to ask. . Poor service. Probably won't be back.."}
{"text":"They are only getting 2 stars because they haven't always given me terrible sandwiches. The last few times that I have come though the service has been less than mediocre. I ask for cold I get a hot which. This most recent time I will say was the worst. I got a wrap and only got 2 out of the 7 ingredients that I requested. The wrap wasn't even wrapped properly, it looked like a square. So I drive all the way back bc im hungry and I paid for a wrap. I wait in line for 5 min just for the \"assistant manager\" to say do I want a refund or for them to remake it! Like hello obviously I want my wrap but I should be given some type of free which coupon for my time and their mistake but no. Problem will not be going back which sucks bc they actually have good sandwiches."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. We just randomly showed up looking for a late lunch. Pretty easy. You pick what you like fill it out on the bag turn it in and they make it. That easy. They have Come product which is always a plus for me. They had a great selection of sandwiches which made it hard to choose which one. I would definitely come back and try another. Very very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Best cold subs, clean, friendly staff. I love the seafood salad sub. I also love you mark all the trimmings on the bag and they have so much more than Subway"}
{"text":"Lots of options here. Don't let the ordering process overwhelm you. Try the turkey club or the Italian grinder. I have heard very good things about the meatball sub too!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of sandwiches since I can make myself a sandwich at home, but Which Wich really takes it up a notch!  I like their vegetarian options- the Tomato and Avacado is ridiculously tasty!  I add hummus, blue cheese, swiss cheese, balsamic vinaigrette and some purple onions = BOOM BAM!  Delicious lunch in a bag ready to go!  Oh, and if you have any room left for dessert- the ice cream cookie is also worth trying = warm cookies with cold ice cream in the middle.?.  Who doesn't want that?!?  Seriously- get online or into your car and get yourself some sandwiches from Which Wich  :-)"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time last night for dinner.  It wasn't exactly welcoming, but once we figured out what we were expected to do the process began to make more sense.  I ordered a Turkey club with a bunch of add-ons and an oatmeal raisin ice cream cookie.  OMG!  The cookie came out first (for some reason) and it was delicious!  The cookies were full size and warm with a thick layer of vanilla ice cream between them.  I appreciated the double foil wrapping to keep it warm and to keep the ice cream contained.  

My sandwich was also delicious.  I'd contemplated adding tomatoes to it because I wanted it heated and I dislike hot tomatoes, but I went on ahead after preparing myself to pull the hot tomatoes off at a later point.  To my surprise, the warm sandwich arrived with cold tomatoes and onions on it!!  Sure- that's the way it SHOULD be done everywhere, but it just SO isn't the way it's usually done anywhere!  I was very impressed with that along with the perfectly toasted bread- crusty and warm without being hard or burned...  well done  :-)  We didn't get any chips because we didn't need them, the sandwiches and the ice cream cookie were delicious and fully satisfying.  

Upon arrival we'd wondered why they chose such an inconvenient location, but after sampling the product, it makes sense now because why pay a premium for \"location, location, location\" when you can simply make dynamite food and people will track you down to get it  :-)  Smart business model there Which Wich!  We'll be back for sure  :-)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this week, definitely will be going back! I got the turkey club toasted, and I was not disappointed. I like the concept of checking off all that you would like on your sandwich before you get to the cashier, I also like that they offer a \"skinny wich\" this is where they scrap out some of the inside bread to cut back on calories. My only complaint is that it was a little pricey for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Simplicity......get in get out with a quality sandwich or salad. I would choose this place over jimmy johns any day and subway by a long shot. Unlike other da which places that try to reinvent the wheel, this place makes sandwiches the way they should be.....Awesome.!!!!"}
{"text":"We are so excited that this opened up. Used to go to this place in Texas. All sandwiches are good and the place is immaculate."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there as we were in the area and neither of us had been there before. It was super busy, but we still had someone come up to us to ask us if we needed help, since the ordering there is fun and different! The wait wasn't long, and the sandwiches were really good! They may have been slightly overpriced though. However if you go, get a chocolate chip cookie. They are fresh made and hot, super delicious!"}
{"text":"For a chain sandwich place, I've been impressed every time I've walked in. On this particular occasion I continued my reuben adventure around Charlotte and was again quite happy with what was served. The highlight of the sandwich was the rye, which had great flavor. For the price and convenience it's hard to beat a reuben like this!"}
{"text":"Cheeze whiz with beef!? Seriously!? After I ate that sandwich I was wondering why the hell I hadn't checked this place out. For a sandwich joint it's so unique. I have to admit I was confused at first. I could use one of those guides for how to properly fill in the bubble because I was Xing instead of filling in. If that was a high school test I would've failed. The way you pick a bag, mark what you want and pass it along. In that sense it really stands out among the \"other guys\".

So ditch your Subway, your Quizno's, your Jersey Mike's and make a special trip to Birkdale to try the cheeze whiz with beef! Load it on with shrooms, bacon, BBQ, A1 and some lettuce to make you feel better about all those bad choices. Keep water close at hand because this is a sodium enriched smorgas-bun of greatness."}
{"text":"New location! I am happy that they finally got one closer to where I am at. I had visited the one located at Westgate a few times and loved it. Now I have one close to where I am at and it will definitely be a new stop for lunch for me."}
{"text":"The owner of this Which Wich location was quick to contact me and apologize for the mistake on my meal. She offered me a free replacement bowlwhich of my choosing and a complimentary drink.

On my return visit, I had an outstanding bowlwhich loaded with black bean patty, hummus, dijon mustard, feta cheese, cucumber, tomato, caramlized onions, spinach, lettuce, banana pepper, garlic, salt and pepper. It was made to order and perfectly done."}
{"text":"Maybe I missed doodling class growing up, but except for places where you get to draw on the tablecloth, I don't really dig the \"place your own order\" process. Just not in my wheelhouse. To make matters worse at WW - at least, this WW - you see a line of bags with numbers in these sleeves, with no indications of what the numbers mean.

You then have to look up to the menu to see those numbers, then you look back at the bag to see what corresponds, then back to the menu to figure out what goes where. How about putting a name on the sleeves, such as \"ham\", \"turkey\" and whatnot. Actually, a \"whatnot\" bag would be nice, as a #1 just has no ring to it.

Anyway, once you pull the bag, you get to fill out lots of little circles - use it like a Scantron, check that bad boy, whatever floats your boat. Choose your size, add extra meat, pile on the cheese, toppings, make it toasted. Even grab a card for milkshake or cookie. Add your name (or some nom de plume) and turn it in.

Definitely grab a cup for a drink, because their crushed ice is awesome.

Then wait. And wait. And wait some more. Maybe writing it down is better than eyeing someone while an artiste makes your sandwich at other joints, but whatever the reason, it takes way longer. It could be because they just opened. At least the staff is friendly and you have a cup of crushed ice."}
{"text":"More than anything else, I loved the concept. With places like Subway, I always feel hurried into making my selections when there are people waiting in line behind me, but at Which Wich, you just pick out a bag, mark all the meats / veggies / sauces that you might want, put down your name and hand it to the servers. 
Their buffalo chicken is really good, but that's the only thing I tried so I can't really say much about anything else in comparison. The veggies were really fresh and my sandwich was neatly wrapped up. I tend to be a messy eater, so I give extra points to anyone who wraps up sandwiches in a way that I don't get mayo down the front of my shirt. 
Parking can get a little tricky since this is right in the middle of the Met area, and although I went here on a Saturday, I can imagine this place being really busy on weekdays during lunchtime."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it won't be my last. Everything was easy to do and my sandwich was delicious. I got the grinder on white bread. I loved it. It was so good and the ingredients were really fresh. The restaurant was also clean but we were there right when they opened. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went here for the very first time. Sandwiches were great. You walk in and there was someone to explain how to order. Got the authentic Philly cheesesteak and the Cuban. Both were delicious and fresh tasting. Cool and easy concept. A little on the pricier side but worth it."}
{"text":"I like the concept. But the sandwiches were mediocre. The bread was bland and dry. The staff wasn't very friendly. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Place was dirty , cashier had cuts all over his arms and wore his food gloves to ring up my order then kept the same gloves on after he touched register and credit card to make my order. Gross and unsanitary, I will not return."}
{"text":"I heard about Which Wich opening up in Scottsdale a while ago but since it was so far North, I didn't have a reason to go. But now that my office is down the street, I decided to try them out for lunch. I walked in and the staff was very friendly and helpful, asking if I knew how the ordering process worked and offering suggestions when I asked for some. I ended up getting the buffalo chicken sandwich. The sandwich was really good and I was pleased with the value of my meal. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Pretty average sandwich shop.  Not sure what all the breathless fuss is about.  Sandwich was pricey and darned meager on content.  Ambiance of a tiled bathroom.  You can do better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich shops! The service is very efficient and the toppings are delicious! I always order the roast beef sandwich and it is just perfect!"}
{"text":"Sucks when in a year ago with the place was booming food was delicious service Good
Don't know what happened since...it must be going out of business they didn't have any bags of place was dirty all there was was some Asian woman in the back and woman with ill fitting dentures in the front they didn't even have the right bag she grabbed a bag took my order and didn't even let me finish saying what I wanted on the sandwich and the sign they you can't even read where it says sandwiches are served hot so I got a hot sandwich with hot lettuce wilted tomato it was gross wont recommended think they're going out of business it's obvious nope"}
{"text":"I have to say that I was not super impressed with this sandwhich joint. First, you must select your sandwich and toppings, write your choices on a bag. The which artist hangs your bag up on a clothesline and makes your sandwich. I got the philly cheesesteak with spicy peppers. I loved the peppers but the sandwich was pretty dry. I was not overly impressed and it was rather expensive for the small sandwich I received. I would rather go to Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"Love this place! Super fast and the subs are great! The staff is always nice too!! One of our fave places to visit!"}
{"text":"No complaints with this place. Subway was my go-to place for sandwiches but I will definitely be coming back here.

You fill out what you want on the sandwich bag with their marker and hand it to the cashier. I kind of like this way of ordering because it's quicker than waiting on the person ahead of you who cant decide.  (Often times thats me)

Had the meatball sub on wheat. I liked the bread a lot. I think the only choice of sides is a bag of chips. Focus is on the subs obviously."}
{"text":"We've now been here several times and while the first time was pretty good, the last few times weren't so great. Our orders keep coming back to us wrong and since we always get them to go we never know until we get home. The last time we visited the subs tasted bland and boring. I hope that things get better but until then we'll just go to Jimmy John's or Firehouse subs."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at a Which Wich. The staff was very helpful in explaining how the ordering process works. The guy that made my sandwich even made it in a way that was easy to eat while driving without making a mess of the condiments."}
{"text":"Shocked ! Have been to many other which which' sand this one is gross. Floor are dirty and it was mess when I walked in. Plus the fact that the person making sandwiches and the cashier was the same person. If you want to be known as a higher lever sandwich shop it wouldn't hurt to have more employees. The best shop is the pv mall one."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for a sub sandwich this is the place. Made to order, fresh, fast and at a good price. The shakes are also very good."}
{"text":"My one and only visit to this chain wasn't the best. It took forever to get my meal, it tasted well didn't have much taste at all, it was like eating some lawn clippings wrapped up in soggy cardboard.  I honestly threw 3/4 of it away and went elsewhere. One day when I run out of options Ill stop by. I'm not sure when, I left with a bad taste in my mouth, well actually no taste!"}
{"text":"Perhaps I had a different experience because I ate a catered sandwich by them. My company ordered 200 boxed sandwich lunches today and I was incredibly disappointed. We have used many other sandwiches places in the past, but wanted to try something new. The bread was stale, they were very stingy with the meat, the choco chip cookie was burnt and tasted like it came out of a packaged box.  I am really disappointed in their catering services. I won't spend my own money on a sandwich here, which is sad because other people gave it such great reviews."}
{"text":"Had the poor boy; the sandwich was marginal; concerned that it took too long to get the sandwich; had a number of young people working, I think five and only making sandwiches; not a bad idea but the owners need to be paying better attention at night"}
{"text":"YOU GUYS. Sandwiches are my favorite. No, they aren't fancy and they aren't gourmet (or they try to be gourmet, and they just end up being expensive) but they ARE a cornerstone of my diet. They are life. SANDWICHES FOREVER.

Which Wich is a sandwich paradise. I usually really hate \"Build Your Own\" options, as I can't make up my mind and end up with a combo that's either underwhelming or just doesn't mesh. For some reason, I felt none of that here. There are ample options, but not a bzillion.

I went with the black bean patty on toasted (duh) wheat with pepper jack (sufficiently melty), red onions, avocado, iceberg, tomatoes, bell peps, black olives and S&P.

IT WAS DELICIOUS. The smallest size is 7 inches, which was more than enough for me.

The avocado costs a dollar extra, but is worth it, as it's actual fresh mashed avos and not that weirdo green dip made up of scary tastes and textures. The black bean patty was really tasty and hearty. The veggies were fresh, although next time I might just skip lettuce, as there was a little too much and it didn't add much. The only thing I wished for was maybe a salsa option as a spread, since I don't think mayo or mustard really go with the flavor profile I put together. I see salsa as an option on their website so maybe I just need to ask. Next time!

I'm eyeballing the hummus option and caprese option for future visits. And there will be many future visits!"}
{"text":"3.5 - 4 stars for me...rounding up for the really friendly service...

The new Which Wich opened a few weeks ago and ever since I heard it compared to Potbelly's I was on a mission to get there. I love, LOVE, me some Potbelly's so I was hoping Which Wich would provide the same access to tasty sammies and sides.

When hubs and I first walked in we were greeted by happy, smiley people, a super clean establishment and a really cool ordering system. Which Wich has an array of pre-stamped paper bags which you are to mark your sandwich type and toppings. All 'wiches are toasted, btw. I chose the turkey on wheat with pesto, avocado, tomato, lettuce and mozzarella. 

Now, my sandwich was good but not great and it's mostly my fault. I probably shouldn't have gone with the pesto as it was a little too overwhelming with the dainty turkey. I tried hubs' beef cheesteak and it was really, really good. I may get that next time around. I, like Jason L, was blown away by the myriad of options here. Next time I'll be my careful choosing my toppings for my 'wich of choice!

BTW - they also serve breakfast sandwiches all day!"}
{"text":"Very clean very fast service, lil small and only 2 seats outside to sit. Other then those two things it's an awesome place and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, mediocre food, don't see how it's better than subway, for the same price you get much more at subway. My recent visit just reminded me how bad it is, will not to go this franchise( not just this store)  anymore."}
{"text":"If you don't like this place then it's on you because you control everything about your sub and I am pretty sure there is no sub combination that is impossible to make. 3 sizes, heated or not, every detail is yours. Don't let the decisions paralyze you. The crushed ice for drinks is money."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Your first visit you will be completely overwhelmed when you walk through the door. Don't worry. They are prepared for that. Someone will hold your hand (figuratively) and baby step you through the process. 

If you dislike your sandwich here, you don't really have anyone to blame but yourself. Pick your bag and start crafting your masterpiece. 10 bag options. Once you agonize over that, vessel decisions. White, wheat, wrapped in lettuce or in a bowl. Hot or cold. Toppings galore. The combinations and possibilities are endless. Well not endless, but I'm not going to sit here and do that math. Numbers. Hard. 

Oh and a very important note... THEY HAVE THE GOOD ICE HERE. You know what I'm talking about.

This location is clean. The workers are ridiculously nice. They pretty much have to be to walk customers through How to Order a Sandwich 101. Parking can be a problem here. You may have to walk a mile... that is if you can even find a spot. 

Would you describe yourself as someone who has trouble making decisions? This may not be your best option to grab a sandwich."}
{"text":"The ordering system is a pretty decent concept (checking off boxes on a paper bag) and it would be very hard to mess up. However, half the time they would mess up my order for a simple sandwich. It's really not that hard to read off a bag... This place isn't that special. Save your time and money to make a sandwich at home."}
{"text":"The good thing is they have wide varities of sandwiches, easy to order but i did not like taste of sandwich here. I did mot feel too comfortable with my sandwich. It is just a walking distance from my office but would choose different if i have other options."}
{"text":"I'm been in search for a good sandwich shop within 1 mile of my home.  Which Wich seems to be my choice.  I love the concept they have going on.  You pick your meat from the selected brown bags and on the bag you select your added ingredients.  There is no way to mess it up.  You're responsible for your own ingredient selection and it's almost impossible for them to get it wrong.  The sandwich was prepared in a timely manner and it tasted very fresh.  Even the bread tasted freshly baked which is a plus for sandwich shops.  Oh, I forgot to mention that when I walked in, I was greeted and asked if I had been there before.  I said no and the attendant proceeded with helping me understand their concept.  That made things much easier for me.  I will definitely be coming back for more sandwiches here."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly...but I left unsatisfied.  It was just a sandwich.  I was hoping it would be better than a Subway, Blimpie or JJ...but not at all.  I say to skip it and save your 9.00 bucks.  I left hungry and wanting something to sink my teeth into."}
{"text":"I Must Say this is and amazing place to Eat the customer service was the best I've ever seen Carlos was fantastic  amazing customer Skills very patient with me and had amazing assistant by his team member bree and tiffany the Store manager  was patient and kind With Directing me over the phone to The location and the Sandwhich here are REALLY GOOD and Made right and Done the right Way  Highley Recommended  a Vist here And You get Free cookies when you Do A Survey on Staff"}
{"text":"I' am from Philadelphia and I'm always disappointed with the \"Philly Cheesesteak\" sandwich places in the Phoenix area.  Either the steak is wrong or the bread is soggy.   I was a little apprehensive when I ordered a Philly Cheesesteak at Which Wich although the sign stated they used Amoroso rolls (a terrific bakery in the Philadelphia area).  The cheesesteak was fabulous - everything was right!  I almost felt like I was back in Philly.  Hope they keep this as a menu option - I will be back soon for another."}
{"text":"Amazing!! It's hard to find GREAT customer service these days, but this sandwich shop and location has mastered it! Awesome food and AMAZING customer service!!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich you can get. A bit more expensive then other sub sandwich places but totally worth it"}
{"text":"Not the best managed outlet tbh. Today was the second time they just forgot to do my order and kept me waiting for upwards of a half hour."}
{"text":"Love Which Wich! I always try a new sandwich every time I go and haven't been disappointed yet. (40+ visits so far)"}
{"text":"So I was introduced to this place one day at work when we received a tray of sandwiches for in service.

Initially, I wanted Sushi 101...but since that was closed (along with the rest of Charlotte) for Sunday lunch.... I noticed the Which Wich? sign across the parking lot.   Decided to try it out....

It took me about 5 minutes or so to figure out what the heck was going on with the ordering process.  After catching on, I thought it was genius.   

Menu is set up by Numbered Categories.  Ie:  1- Beef, 2- Chicken, 3-Comofort Sandwiches...etc.   You select your number and then pull a brown sandwich bag off the wall with the corresponding #.   They have Red Sharpies so you can check off the other things you want to add.   (Let, Tom, Olive, Japs, Chz, pickle, etc etc...).     Take the bag to the register and the bag with your order is sent down the line.   You pick your bag up at other end of line.   

Food was GREAT!   I don't know why I always go for the Comfort Food....but I had the best Egg Salad Sandwich.     The first time I tried it at work...the sandwiches were not dressed up.  When I had the opportunity to dress my Egg Salad up today... I was like \"OH MY....\"    

Ice Machine has that fabulous \"hospital\" crushed ice pellets.

Inside seating area....LACKING..... it's Small...very McDonalds like.... but none the less that was no reason to pull back by a star on my rating. 

Cheap, good, and fast..... WAY TO GO.   

Which Wich? is now a staple in my weekly rotation of eating out."}
{"text":"So disappointed!  I gave this location another try today after waiting for over 20 minutes for my sandwich (which had an ingredient left off) a couple of weeks ago.  Today was a much shorter wait, but yet again, my sandwich is not correct!  I'll be going elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Finally made a stop in here and am glad I did. The price point is along the lines of Subway but Which Wich has a FAR wider selection. The service was prompt & polite (someone made the comment that the \"staff is young. Take that for what it's worth\" - not sure if they had an issue or what they meant but our experience was pleasant. 
One thing that I really liked about the sandwich compared to Subway is it wasn't too bready.
I am glad that I had read other reviews before going which clued me into how the ordering works.
I forecast many return visits."}
{"text":"I love eating here not only because the food is good but also the guy who prepared my order was very nice and friendly"}
{"text":"Great staff! As soon as we walked in we were greeted by an employee who was cleaning a table. He asked if we'd been in before and when we said no he dropped what he was doing and said \"well let me come and show you how it works!\" #awesomedude 
The restaurant was very clean and the sandwiches are made to order. You take a bag off the wall and select exactly what you want on your sandwich. If you're  doing low carb you can get your sandwich as a lettuce wrap or a bowl. They also have vegeterian options. I even wrote in that I wanted banana peppers on the side. (they got it right) Everything was fresh and delicious. I'll definitely be back. It was also super affordable for this level of sandwich shop.
Oh, and they do this too which is really cool! #givingbackrocks

{"text":"So many options you'll freak

If you grapple with decision-making, designing your own sandwich at Which Wich will freak you the hell out.  Here's the daunting list of ingredient options that will need to mull over:  
* 13 meats
* 2 breads and a lettuce wrap option
* Hot or cold
* 10 cheeses
* 4 mustards
* 4 mayo options
* 9 spreads & sauces
* 5 dressings
* 19 vegetable / miscellaneous (candied walnuts, perchance?)
* 7 oils & spices

Applying my admittedly feeble mathematical skills, if you wanted to make a cold sub on white with five ingredients, there are over 1.3 BILLION possible combinations.  Granted, some options make little sense, the five dressing sub for instance, but still, you catch my drift on the issue of option overload.  

Not wanting to deal with the plethora of permutations, I elected to order the prefabricated Philly Cheesesteak.  While not as good as my go-to Philly at the Parkway Family restaurant, the Which Wich version was significantly better than your typical Subway offering (sorry, Jared).  The toasted hoagie roll added some appreciated crunch and the sandwich brimmed over with well-trimmed, albeit slightly dry, beefsteak.  The onions were more sautéed than caramelized, but hey, caramelized onions at a fast food restaurant, sign me up.   At $7.50, I'd prefer a larger sandwich, but it was not a terrible value given the quantity and quality of the ingredients.

Like the quality of the food, the service at this location exceeded expectations.  When the woman at the counter saw my confused expression when entered the store, she immediately explained the ordering process for me.  She also asked what I thought of my sandwich and when I indicated it was slightly dry, she offered some suggestions on how to remedy the problem during my next visit.  The restaurant appeared clean and well maintained, thought a little sterile.  The prep time for my sandwich was over 10 minutes on a snowy night with a handful of customers, so I expect there may be a wait during the lunchtime crush.

While I don't see making Which Wich a frequent stop, I'll likely stop by again when I have time to ponder my several billion options."}
{"text":"I just had my first sandwich here, and I was very impressed. The person working took the time to explain how everything works, and gave me a punch card for future use! I ordered the small turkey club and had their homemade chips...much better than Subway/Jimmy Johns/etc. 

I'm very impressed by the atmosphere, everyone seems to like their job and were very nice."}
{"text":"Food was what we expected... fresh warm and good!! We had a small group so it was what we wanted and we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great sub spot...I always order the turkey sub I add spinach, tomatoes, carmalized onions, avocado, mayo and provolone. I love the set up when you decide you just fill in what you want on the baggy before you go to the register. The staff there are pretty helpful as well."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment...

I had been looking forward to trying this place for a long time, and even convinced my family to try in with me instead of Jimmy Johns (that they love). It was 11:15 A.M. and we tried to open the doors but they were locked. The sign said they opened at 11, but there was no one around. We waited a couple minutes and a girl who looked like she just woke up came out of the back to open the door and let us in. She left us alone to try to figure out how we order and we managed to find the bags and start filling them out. Once we were ready there was no one around and we waited while another girl tried to fill the drink dispenser. Finally we said forget it and left without getting a chance to even order. Back to Jimmy Johns for these potential customers. 

My tip is that if you want service and good food go to Jimmy Johns, Subway, or even better...Sacks!"}
{"text":"Very clean and nice store. Great location that provides outdoor seating. Very urban and open layout. Small store but it has great food!

Employees were \"iffy\". Some were nice, others could at least smile. Either way the food was great and the atmosphere was amazing. I would recommend to anyone looking for a cheap but good meal"}
{"text":"Have not been able to go back to Which Which on Woodlawn. The bad experience was more troubling to me than I realized. I have been to several others in the area, each have been good experiences."}
{"text":"Nothing really special, your average sandwich place. Not bad, not great. I got a regular size chicken pesto sandwich. A good size... I like the toastiness of the bread and pesto makes anything taste good."}
{"text":"This is about as corporate as a restaurant you're going to get, down to the canned music. I paid $28 bucks for just 3 sandwiches, no drinks or chips. The sandwiches had very little meat in it and it's mostly bread. For an almost $10 sandwich, it doesn't live up to what it needs to be."}
{"text":"The food is great but it takes way to long to get your order. I've waited over a half an hour for my sandwich. If you have limited time to get your lunch, don't go here."}
{"text":"My wife had the Italian sub. I had a Philly steak and cheese. 

No taste. Not really Italian bread. 

Specifically told them no peppers or onions. Guy starts to prepare my sandwich WITH green peppers (which I hate), then proceeds to actually pick them out. 

When I confronted him about it, I told him I wanted him to make me a new sandwich. I didn't want him picking out stuff. Come on... dump the sandwich and make a fresh one correctly as I ordered. 

A step up from awful Subway, but just barely. 

Asked for a to-go menu and they were out. Really?  

Went during lunch on a Friday. We were the only ones there. What does that tell you?

And came home, where I proceeded to get sick to my stomach. Something in the sandwich did not agree with me. 

Won't be returning. Doesn't anyone out here know how to make a hot oven grinder or a good sub sandwich?"}
{"text":"This is a very good concept to the whole sub thing. They are quick and the subs are good. Quality of vegtables are great. It was my first time the other day and I will be stopping in again!"}
{"text":"I love their huge selection of building and customizing your own sandwich here. They usually will have a monthly featured sub on top of all the other sandwiches they offer. I definitely love the variety here and they are one of my first few choices when im in the mood for a sub."}
{"text":"By far the best sub/sandwich restaurant around.  The best selection I have seen.  I have tried the chicken salad and added pesto (which is a topping you can add to any sandwich) it was delicious on the toasted bread.  I haven't gone wrong with any selection there,The Thank You Turkey is delicious, loved the Caprese, I could go on but just check out their menu (it's online).  You can also place your order online and pick it up, nice and convenient.  The family owned franchise is attentive and it's clean clean clean!!!  A must try."}
{"text":"We came in around 10:30 after a little bit of drinking. Which Wich is surprisingly open until 11 on campus, which I previously did not know.

I ordered a surf & turf which is like a roast beef with imitation crab. I checked almost every single option on the bag as far as toppings goes.

I was very surprised at how good this turned out. The sandwich was well put-together and blended quite well for the amount of toppings I put on. They didn't seem to skimp too much on anything from what I remember, which is always good.

The sandwich was also a good sized portion, too. When you load all those toppings on there it becomes quite substantial and I was adequately full after eating it all. I got a medium which they say is 10.5''. 

Which Wich is kind of expensive though, my sandwich was just over $9. I still think it's probably one of the best if not the best sub place on campus."}
{"text":"Just opened!  Clean. Easy. Delicious. Fast. 

There were at least eight staff working.  Definitely more than necessary but they were probably training. 

Order your sammich on the bag. Easy to customize. 

There's an app for ordering ahead if you're in a hurry. 

And there's a loyalty card for those who may want to become a regular. 

Good stop!"}
{"text":"I love this sandwich shop!! I just ate there for the first time and it was great!  There are so many different choices  as to what sandwich to choose and what to put on top, and it's so much easier to mark it on a paper bag and take it to the counter.  Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is good.  The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because my sandwich wasn't hot enough in the middle;  however it was still delicious!  I'll def be coming back!"}
{"text":"Have tried this once.  I got the meatball sub and it was just average.  I really liked a couple things so will try this again ordering a different sandwich for comparison.  What di d I like?  I used online ordering, this was great.  I walked in bypassed the 20 deep line got my sandwich and headed out.  Since I paid online I was in the shop for less then a minute. Easy and convenient!  The other thing that Iliked was how well wrapped the hot sandwich was, Paper inside foil inside paper.  It was still nicely hot by the time I got it home and ate.  Right now I like Jimmy Johns sandwich better but will try a comparable sandwich on my next trip and may up this to a 4.

Second visit, I got the Italian Grinder.  Nothing great about the sandwich, just okay.  The lines are long here at lunch time, I'm not really sure why, use the online ordering! .  I'll try this one more time for their salad, just trying to find another lunch place to get some variety.  The online ordering worked as well this time as the last.

3rd times a charm I keep going back!  I also tried a sandwich as a salad and liked that, basically a chopped salad but the extras available really kick it up.   I think I finally figured  the combo of extras that I like on the sandwich and have now had something from every category except seafood.  I'm waiting to try the Elvis sounds pretty different. I have also been getting the banana milkshake regularly.  This has moved to the top of my sandwich places."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week for lunch and let me say that it is always what I want! The store is always very clean and my sub is ready promptly even when it is busy. Ruben and Julian are by far the best people that work there, always smiling and happy to help! Love this location and the people that work there!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I went here last Friday for lunch.  We ordered 45-60 minutes ahead of time online. The instructions said when we got there to go straight to the pick up area for our food. When we arrived it was a few minutes after our pick up time, the place was packed and two guys behind the counter wouldn't acknowledge us or meet our eyes. After a few minutes I was finally able to get one of their attention. We informed him we were there to pick up our online order. The guy at the pick up station asked the guy at the register if he had any online orders. The guy at the register gave us a deer in the headlights look, they hadn't even printed them. The guy at the pick up station told us our order came in just before a rush, he offered no apology. They then put our orders on the line, behind everyone in the lunch rushes orders. We asked what was the point of ordering online? They guy just said it depends on the day, some days they get a rush and some they don't, again no apology or offer to expedite our order. Apparently online orders don't matter of a rush comes in. We had to wait quite a while to finally get our food and rush back to work, they still never apologized for the delay. I ordered a BLT bowl with turkey, ham, bacon, pepper jack, lettuce and spicy ranch. I got 95% shredded iceberg lettuce and 5% meat and cheese. It was a disappointing visit and meal. An apology or some kind of gesture to show that they cared about fixing their mistakes would have gone a long way to help the situation. This was my first and last visit."}
{"text":"I stopped by today and ordered a chicken sub. When I got home and opened my sandwich, I had a turkey sub. When I ordered my food, I noticed that the cashier was processing a large catering order of turkey subs. So I guess that they mixed my sub up. It's funny that I have gone there and they are super busy and the get my order correct. Today I was the only person there and they mess up my order."}
{"text":"So, I've been to a which wich a few years ago in Chicago and I remember liking the caprese sandwich. I was Christmas shopping at the chandler mall and headed towards the target when my stomach started growling... I passed by the which wich and I was like whoa!!! There's one here!

So, You order by checking what you want on one if the provided paper bags. I chose the veggie and picked the caprese with Olive salad and garlic dressing. It was sooo good! I was worried it wasn't going to turn out good, but it really did! I also ordered the house chips which was peppery and I liked that. All in all, great experience. The staff was friendly too and clean store!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. Very unique. Instead of standing there holding up the line while you decide what you want on your sand which which you probably get every single time you go to a sub shop you look at the menu.. take out a bag and check each and every item you want on it. They even make it into a salad for you. The food is good. Fresh actually contrary to others comments. I have been there many times and never had a bad experience. The employee's are well trained and nice. And having a towel roll for towels is a lot better then napkins. Give this place a try for sure."}
{"text":"Made my sandwich wrong twice in a row.  Ended up just asking for my money back, won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Okay sandwiches, chips, drink-not good, not bad. About $25 for two sandwiches, 2 chips, 2 drinks. Build your own from bread to dressing. Pick it up and bring it to your table-no wait staff. 

It is a storefront, usually crowded-nice view of John Street in Matthews at the outside umbrella tables. Other casual restaurants and 2nd floor apartments make this new store section feel old-timey and historic."}
{"text":"Unimpressive.
We stopped here for the first time last week. We thought that the ordering was unique, but certainly not great. I tried the Turkey Wich and my boyfriend tried The Wicked. When we got home and started eating our sandwiches, we looked at each other and basically said the same thing- where's the meat??? Considering the Wicked is a sandwich that comes with five different types of meat and three different types of cheese... we were expecting a little more.

We shared an oreo shake, and it was tasty. They also have punch cards, something like buy 10 sandwiches, get 11th free. Though I don't think we will be back to fill ours up."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I'm not really a fan of sandwiches. I just think they are kind of boring. But Which Wich has definitely won me over! 

There are so many choices for different sandwiches, and the prices are really good. I'm hooked on the tomato avocado veggie sandwich - it's loaded with avocado, and I'm thrilled that hummus is an available topping (at no charge). 

Which Wich serves their vegetarian clientele very well. Other than my favorite, there are several other veggie sandwich options, like the tomato caprese or the Mediterranean, as well as several seafood options. 

For meat eaters, the choices are unbelievable. My hubby favors the Wicked - it's loaded with five meats (pre-selected) and three cheeses (you select). Olive spread is another available topping, and it works really well on this sandwich. 

If you haven't been to Which Wich before, I strongly urge you to check out the menu on their website before going. That will help navigate the vast menu and all the condiment options. I appreciate that when you arrive, you step over to the side to place your order on a bag. That way, you are not holding up the line while making your selections. When you're ready, you give the bag to the cashier to ring you up, and then wait for your sandwich to be made.

We tried a vanilla milkshake with banana on our last visit, and it was good but a bit pricey ($3.50). Even so, we'll probably get one again, ha ha.

Which Wich is a great addition to Birkdale, with reasonable prices and great food. I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Which Wich is my new on-the-go sandwich spot. Great value for a solid, customizable sandwich. And the owner is a friendly, enthusiastic guy whose cool glasses should be appreciated by all!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good, odd ordering system but once you do it it works pretty good. A lot more options than a subway . They are open on Sundays even though yelp says they are closed"}
{"text":"Went yesterday at around 1:30. It was not crowded and only one order ahead of us. First thing we noticed was three tables were unoccupied but were very dirty. The person ahead of us and my party had to go into restroom and get wet paper towels to clean the tables.

The person taking our orders was not friendly at all and the food took a very long time with 4 or 5 minutes between orders so that the first person was done a long time before the last.

I may try another location but won't be back to this location as the service and dirty tables were unacceptable."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time going to this location it's awful. If you order online you'll still end up waiting half an hour to get your order when you get there because they probably overlooked it and when you get home it won't even be close to the sandwich you ordered. What a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Used to love this place.  Used to get greeted upon entry, not any more.  Same two broken high chairs from over a year ago, dirty tables, no napkins by beverages, over flowing trash cans will make me find a place more eager for my business."}
{"text":"If you love customizable sandwiches, this is the place to go. My only disappointment is the longevity of these subs. When I venture out in sub places, I tend to order large subs so I can bring some home to eat for later. This is one of the rare places where the subs didn't taste good at all when I got them out of the fridge. I wonder why that is..."}
{"text":"That gyros sandwich was a disgrace to all things sandwich. If you're not going to make legit gyros and not have them pre shaven (way too thick) like your subway than don't even try to make a gyro sandwich!!! Gyros don't deserve this!!!!!"}
{"text":"The name of the place itself caught my attention but I don't think it's anything special. 

I liked the concept of building your own sandwich and the brown baggy was pretty cute too. I ordered the shrimp banh mi- this was something I was extremely excited for! Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed by it. Cool name for a sandwich but flavors weren't there. This might have been there for just a limited amount of time but if you see it, don't get too excited. I took a picture of it so I'm going to dig it up sometime (whenever it is!).

Overall, I wouldn't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best sandwich places we have been to!  Awesome idea with the bags...not too hard to figure out if it is your first time.  The ingredients were fresh and it was great till the last bite!  Definitely coming back here for a fun date-night or lunch stop."}
{"text":"My first time here. Loved the idea of the paper bags to customize your order. So cute and vintage like! And plus you can take as long as you want to order without worrying about a line behind you lol. 
The sandwich itself was yummy! A generous amount of toppings, but not a messy sandwich. Crispy crunchy bread. 
My 10 inch sandwich with a medium drink and chips was $13.60 with tax, so it felt a little expensive. But it was big enough for my husband and I to share, so the price evened out :-)
I liked this place and will be back :-)"}
{"text":"Overall this is a pretty cool place with very good sandwiches.  I must have looked lost when I went in for the first time because the guy behind the counter patiently explained the process.  You pick a bag from a group (beef, pork, chicken etc.) then you check off what you want, things like a choice of mustard, cheese, types of other garnish, cold or toasted etc. Then you write your name on the bag and hang it up.  They were not very busy when I was there so the guy gave me a free drink and we chatted about the sandwiches and sides.  The price was right and my Cuban came out hot, crispy and very tasty.  The only issue I have is the downright horrible parking situation but that is not Which Wich's fault.  Just be aware, if you are in a hurry or easily frustrated, go somewhere else, even in a non-rush time (4:00 PM on a weekday) I had to go to the third level of the parking deck and it was agonizingly slow going.

Check them out if you have the time. They bring a whole new meaning to \"brown-bagging\""}
{"text":"Wow this place is popular... I tried it on a Tuesday at 1:30 PM and this place was still busy.  I had the Grinder with a Shake and both were really good.  

The customer service here is awesome... they even greeted me at the door."}
{"text":"We really enjoy these subs. The food is always fresh. Quick service as well. I highly recommend the grinder italian. We take out most of the time but when we eat in the place is clean and comfortable. There are fountain drinks but you can buy cans of soda if you prefer. Love it, 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"A quick placed to stop for lunch.  This location was very busy at lunchtime during the week, but they seemed to move through it extremely efficiently.

The quality of the food is great.  Everything tasted fresh.  I did think it was a tad pricey for lunch, however, being that it wasn't really anything extraordinary.  

The shop was clean.  The atmosphere was basic, no music playing at time I went in.  Overall ok experience, just not a place to spend a lot of time."}
{"text":"My husband and I swear by this place, we absolutely love it.  We make a visit every 2 week and we don't exactly live close by, about 30 mins.  The service is great and food is amazing.  Subs are fantastic, cookies are ok and shakes are good too. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"This is a new location (about a month old) However, the service and employees have gotten a lot better since their opening week and are much more up to speed. My last visit I had no criticism on their operations, and the food was good as usual. And past couple times I've been in for lunch during the rush, my sandwich was completed in a few minutes. They also had somebody there paying attention for new customers to help them with order creation process.

New customers will find Which Wich confusing at first (the way ordering is done). I've visited enough to find some pretty good sandwich combinations. Right now my favorite creation I've made is a Roast Beef on Wheat, with tomatoes, lettuce, banana peppers, provolone, mayo, honey mustard, salt, pepper, oregano, oil, and vinegar."}
{"text":"I love Which Wich.
Their bread is REALLY good. I also like that you can get it \"skinny\" (the'll scoop the inside).
I typically create my own veggie.
Medium, skinny, hot, mozzarella cheese, light mayo, red onions, coleslaw, black olives, pickles, cucumber, lettuce, tomato, and bell peppers crushed pepper and oregano. YUM!

I also like their black bean patty.

I like that they serve warm sandwiches and that you fill out the bag and hand it to them, so I've never had a mistake!"}
{"text":"Very good sub sandwich shop. Reasonably priced. I recommend the hot subs over the cold ones. I've gotten the turkey hot several times and my wife loves the authentic philly cheese steak. Other reviews complained about having a long wait but I've never waited more than a few minutes.

Staff seemed very friendly especially for an assembly line type of sub shop."}
{"text":"For a fast food joint that specializes in sandwiches these guys kill the competition of Subway, Firehouse and Quiznos. Bread is great. The amount of veggies including MUSHROOMS, the amount of sauces including PESTO, and the amount of options including GYROS blows the competition out of the water. Quality is also much better minus the chicken which is about as sub par as the competition. Prices are higher but worth it. Oh yeah, love the choices of different onions"}
{"text":"I went to this location close to closing. The staff was so kind and helpful. I know they probably did not want someone to come15 minutes to closing but you would not know that from this crew. This was my first time there and they helped me with my order, were super friendly and made sure I got my sandwich as I ordered it.  The sandwich was good. The service so excellent. Just based on the three people there tonight I would go again as the were so nice to help with how to order and what sandwiches are popular."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try Which Wich since they built it, but it just never happened.  I had heard good/interesting things, and it was finally time to ring that bell.  So, over lunch, I headed there with a buddy to try it out.

The first thing that hit me was the selection.  There is a LOT to choose from.  Someone came out to help us through the process (figure out what you want, grab that bag, then mark the toppings, etc.).  After that, there was no pressure - take your time and figure it out.

I went with the Italian grinder - a pretty standard sandwich to set the benchmark.  I was pretty conservative with the toppings as I didn't want anything to overpower the overall flavor of the italian meats.  I went with onion (not often I do that), pickles and cole slaw.  Cole slaw on a sandwich sounds like overdoing it, but it's OH SO good!

I have to say the sandwich was pretty good.  Best ever?  Probably not, but it was much more flavorful than run-of-the-mill sandwich shops (I'm looking at you, Subway).  The meat portion was good.  Not New York deli portions, but you don't see that often around here.  The 7\" sub and a large soda was plenty for a sizable guy like me.  I can't imagine going with \"large\" (14 inches) for a single meal.  The \"medium\" was 10\", but that would leave me in a food coma for the rest of the afternoon...

The prices seemed to be a tad steep.  A 7\" sub was $5.50 (14\" sub was $11 - no deal for ordering more, apparently).  Throw on a soda and you're pushing $8 for a sandwich and drink.  Add chips and you're getting some coins back from your $10 bill.  

If you're looking to fill up with large amounts of food for little money, stick with the $5 footlongs from Subway.  If you're in for quality and the proper amount of food for one meal - and you don't mind spending the money - this is a great place to explore.  I look forward to trying more options in the future!  Next sandwich will be the corned beef with cole slaw... that sounds amazing!"}
{"text":"It's a slightly generous rating, but it's also justifiable based on my most recent experience. It helped that I had been here before and no longer felt like I was taking a quiz when ordering. The service was excellent (including friendly), and the sandwich was great--adding cucumbers helped a lot since they were very fresh and crisp, and this was at night. To top it all off, I had a warm chocolate chip cookie. Yum!"}
{"text":"I hear everyone rave about this place, so decided to go here with my parents and sister...parents and sister have been here twice already and I haven't well cause I've always been busy and not be able to go..finally got to go this afternoon May 19, at 11:20am. I love sandwiches, don't get me wrong. The Italian club looked amazing, so that's what I got.. and I got a vanilla shake. All 4 of us got sandwiches, and 2 of us got a vanilla milkshake.. My sandwich, the Italian club, looked good when I opened it up. Took a bite, and wow. I love pesto spread but there was way too much pesto, and it was salty. I tasted nothing but pesto. Did not taste the Capicola, cheese, Turkey, bacon, or lettuce. Just straight pesto. I could not finish it. Barely could finish half of it til I threw it away. And my shake? Was runny and not thick and just tasted like a McDonald's vanilla shake.
Sorry but I don't think I'll be back..ill stick with jersey mikes. And was gonna take my sandwich to work to finish on my break tonight since I'm a waitress, but no I can't. All that pesto literally made me nauseas. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was great, I had their bag #8. A delicious, mouth watering \"Philly Cheesesteak\". Staff was very fast and friendly. Clean surroundings, cool music, sports on TV and my stomach delightfully full."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a slow Friday for lunch. I ordered fairly quickly but waited too long for my Philly Cheesecake sandwich. Besides the long wait, the Philly was tasty. Warm and toasted with melted provolone cheese."}
{"text":"Location & Aesthetics - Located in Glendale off Bell Road, almost hidden behind Paradise Bakery, and is next to Five Guys.
Plenty of parking despite sharing the parking lot with Five Guys.  Restaurant is spacious, well lit, was clean at the time of our visit.  
Lighting wasn't too bright or too dim.

Menu - posted on a large billboard on the wall as you enter.  What I did like and found different was the order system - one orders their sandwich by filling out a multiple-choice menu that's already pre-printed on their sandwich bag, then you hand the sandwich bag to one of the guys behind the counter and they go to work.  There's even a desk with pens to fill out your choices.
The sandwiches were tasty and for their sizes, filling enough.  Prices were reasonable.
 
Service - The staff was spectacularly nice, friendly, warm and welcoming and answered any questions I had.  

I'll think I'll definitely give them another try."}
{"text":"I love a good sandwich (or as my fellow country folk say it \"sammich\")! Give me some soft bread with turkey and fresh veggies and I'm a happy lady. I had driven by Which Wich many times and always wanted to try it. So the opportunity came and I was...underwhelmed. 

So the whole concept of writing your order on a bag is cool. I got a small turkey on wheat with a variety of veggies. I did the combo. I had read on Yelp that first time customers get a free drink. I inquired about it and was told they don't do this anymore. I asked about upgrading to a large drink but at that point, the employee already rang up my order. I asked if I could just pay the difference and he told me he couldn't \"because there's no button for that\". Okay. Whatever. Not the end of the world. 

The sandwich was just okay. It was sort of sloppily made and a lot of my veggies just fell out of it. The bread was good but the rest was just average. Was it the best sandwich ever? Definitely not. Was it the worst sandwich ever? No. There's much worse. Maybe I need to give this another go but I certainly won't be in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"Writing this as I sit here waiting for my sandwich. I am the only person in this place. The guy starts making my sandwich and then disappears into the back for about 5 minutes. Then another guy comes in who is clearly his friend or also works here. He stops making my sandwich and starts talking to him. Another girl appears from the back and gives me the weirdest look. Then looks at my sandwich . The guy heated up my sandwich even when I had told him I wanted it cold. I ask \"is there something wrong with my sandwich\" he's like yeah I heated it up do you still want it? I said no I'd like a cold one. He then offers my sandwich to the dude who had just walked in. Wtf? I am shakin with anger and frustration. I can see why no one is ever here when I've come in.. Won't be surprised if this place is closed within the next month. OMG I am livid. So I finally ask how much longer my sandwich is going to take because I have groceries in the car that could spoil and it has been 20 minutes at this point to make one sandwich and she said \"we have to let the bread cool down\" and I said but I WANT a cold sandwich so why was the bread warm in the first place. She said she has to toast it because the bread is never fully cooked so we had to cook it. I'm sorry.. that's not true cause I have gotten cold sandwiches and they didn't have to toast it first. What kind of sandwich place cant make cold sandwiches? And WHY wouldn't you just say all this instead of having me sit here like an idiot for 20 wondering what the hell is happening? OMG and the guy who came in after me just got his sandwich before me. I am never ever coming back here, subway is better than this crap. Sorry about the ridiculously long review but I guess I had the time to write it since I have been here for 30 F*#%ing MINUTES!!"}
{"text":"About a week ago I was flying out of Buffalo, NY airport and faced with a rather dismal choice of fast food places to eat lunch, choose something called Which Wich, a place I assumed was a local chain.  In fact the airport is their only location in New York state.  When I got home I wrote a Yelp review of this surprisingly good sub shop, never thinking I would ever see one again.  While writing the review I discovered that Which Wich just opened a location in North Scottsdale 6 weeks ago.  I took a friend today because I HAD to try their \"Wicked\" sandwich which I regretted not trying in Buffalo.

This place is a gem.  Although a franchise, they are a big cut above the typical chain sub shops.  The Scottsdale location (in my opinion) is not the best location they could have chosen for one of the first Which Wich shops in the Valley but it isn't the worst.  It's not large, but adequate.  On a Friday afternoon there was a steady stream of customers, most of them return visitors.  How did I know?  Because at Which Wich the customer walks in and writes their order on their own sandwich bag and it appeared every customer was already familiar with that procedure.

Their website is awesome.  As a new customer joining their Vibe Club you get a free regular sub when you buy chips and a drink and you can either pre-print your order and carry it in or order it on the internet.

Their range of menu choices runs circles around Jersey Mikes, Subway, Togos, Quiznos and similar chains.  Here's my opinion how they compare:

- Quality of food - best of the bunch, their sandwich is more like a mom & pop deli

- Service - from my 2 experiences they own that category.  Their managers know how to hire!

- Convenience - the best. You don't have to wait for someone ahead of you to ponder all day what condiments they want.  That's done BEFORE you ever get to the counter.

- Price vs value - Subway sells a cheap product at a cheap price. The other 3 places I mentioned sell a better than Subway product at a higher price.  Which Wich isn't Subway cheap but I think you will notice the better taste.  And their \"regular\" is huge compared to Jersey Mike's puny regular.

The day I was there one of the franchise owners happened to be doing some work and she personally came over to greet each customer and offer them free samples of brownies and rice krispie treats.  Her attention to detail was awesome, she genuinely cared why each person was there and that they received the best service possible.  After she left the dining area for a while her counter clerk was a clone of her, showing genuine interest in each customer.  I think once people find out about Which Wich they will learn it's not just another sub shop gimmick, but a carefully thought out concept that offers a good balance of quality + value + service.   I know they are MY first choice right now.

(Quick update: the follow-up from this franchise owner is first class)"}
{"text":"If it was based just on food I'd give them all 5 stars. But sadly the service has ruined our experience more than once. The two times we ordered online for pick-up they didn't even start our subs when we walked in 20 minutes after placing our order. It would be understandable if they were busy but both times the place was dead and they didn't even apologize. Like I said, food is delicious just wish they had better service."}
{"text":"Quick, good food, workers are always on point and ready to help and be nice.

The Philly Cheesesteak is pretty damn good for a major chain and not a hole-in-the-wall. Good portion of actual meat and not covered in veggies like Subway/Jimmy John's. The Muffuletta and Grinder are must tries as well. 

My go-to chain shop when I'm around the Tempe area."}
{"text":"My first trip to Which Wich and already a favorite! I am a big fan of the sub sandwich and many restaurants do not cut it. Which Wich absolutely does.

First of all, the concept is cute and efficient. You fill out your order on a brown paper bag, hand it to the cashier, that bag then becomes the sleeve that will house your sub. 

A big part of the sub is of course, the bread. I got my Which Wich toasted - it was done to perfection. Crunchy outside, soft inside, no burn. They give you a good amount of meat and toppings and I love the selection! Things like hummus and tzatziki, avacado, olive salad. Very unique.

When you go, try the house chips. The look of Ruffles, the crunch of Krunchers, with black pepper. 

They also offer cookies & milkshakes, (Milkshakes! At a sub shop!), but I did not try either on this visit.

Great prices - just $5.25 for the regular (7\") sub. It of course goes up in there, but overall very affordable, especially compared to similar restaurants.

The staff was friendly, the atmosphere, casual and minimalist. Good thing it's close to work, because I think I will be stopping here a lot in the future!"}
{"text":"This might have been one of the best sandwichs I ve had in a while. I had the French dip customized to my liking. Aju was salty but better then bland. The bread was crisped right and the meat was quality. Just counting down the  days til I can go back. I laughed when the cashier said I know your going to love it but she was right!!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if I could. I will be making the long drive from Indian land to the CHARLOTTE RIVERGATE location after the service I received. When you enter the location, know that you will see is about 5 teenagers sitting around the counter talking/ gossiping VERY loudly. Loud enough that you can hear them using offensive language such as bit** and retarded. You will not get greeted and when you fill out the sandwich bag for your order, you'll have to wait for them to finish their teenage conversations for them to ring you up and make your sandwich (they stopped several times to converse instead of completing the sandwich). It took 10 minutes for me to get a sandwich that gets made in less than 5 at other Which Wich locations. There were 2 tables that could've been cleaned and no other customers in the facility that needed to be tended too. So I'm wondering why there's 5 teens (who I assume were put in charge to run the place) standing around chatting and rudely \"serving customers\". Don't waste your time at this place."}
{"text":"Soooo many options for building a sandwich. Good selection and friendly staff, but the seating area tables were a little small."}
{"text":"Great concept, friendly staff, and awesome sandwiches.  
Was at Men's Warehouse next door when we heard all the buzz about the new sandwich store next door.  I had never been to a Which Wich before, but I'm always up to trying a new place.  The boisterous staff greeted us and the owner informed us on the sandwich ordering process. It was very crowded, but service was really fast, once you decide from the numerous sandwich choices.
I will definitely be back again to try the \"Wicked\" sandwich."}
{"text":"I got the reuben. wasn't that great. I have had awesome ruebens fro Jewish delis and this isn't even close. hardly enough sauce , cheese or kraut on it and the corned beef seemed more like processed not fresh. Not worth the $8 it cost, maybe $3 if I was really hungry. My husband order the philly cheese steak, he said it tasted good but there was NO CHEESE on it at all, none and hardly and onions or peppers on it. Very dry and disappointing. We will not be going back especially at that price. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Best fast-food sandwich place, hands down! The staff is always friendly, the sandwiches are always hot snd delicious, and it's just too darn convenient to have one of these do close to my job!"}
{"text":"Prolly not a Restaurant that needs Reviews as far as the food Goes. Top notch Samiches.
But my review is for the Owner of the one on Tatum and Shea.
I am a bit of a regular Now.
The reason is.....
Mainly the Owner.
Anytime i may have some situation arise that honestly had nothing to do with their restaurant, but my lack of Technology....
She has always went way above and beyond to fix it and make it right for me.
Walk out every time with a Full Tummy and a Smile.
Gunny"}
{"text":"Superb Subs!  You have them make it your way - with a list of options that will make any mouth happy!  The small (7in) should be sufficient for most appetites weighing in at a 5.50 cover $.  Value, taste and friendliness... win, win, win.  Now hurry in!"}
{"text":"Gross!!! Way too expensive for what you get! I ordered a turkey sandwich... How can you go wrong? Right? Bread was stale, turkey actually had a weird taste, and the toppings were lack luster and practically non-existent to say the least! Prices were so high too... Almost 11$ for a large sandwich meant to split with my hubby but we just threw it out and ate somewhere else! Totally indelible!!! Won't be back!!! Try cheba hut  for one of kind sandwiches at a killer price!"}
{"text":"1st Time in here and took a little bit to get a clue on what to do... Grab a bag, select the options you want...  

They do have many many options not avail in most shops, but you can def overdo it if u get 1 option fomr every darn subsection... 

We got the Ham n Swiss and wife got Roast beef.. Both were pretty darn good. We were there late lunch on Saturday, so hopefully the rush of customers kept the food fresh upon replenishment.. 

Will be back a couple more times before adding this to the rotation.

Also note. Most of the employees are younger kids.. take it for what its worth."}
{"text":"Never saw this place and so I decided to check it out. Very interesting concept. The service was friendly.  I was asked if I'd been there before and when I said no I was walked through the process.  The sandwhich I ordered was very tasty and reasonably priced and they have three different sizes for their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Frankly I don't get the hype....Here's why: After waiting 10 minutes for my rather simple turkey sandwich, I wondered what was really revolutionary about their ordering system...No pun intended but I never waited that long at Subway or Jimmy John's for an order...Actually I would say that Jimmy John's wins in the category of speed...

...and then you would think that by writing down the order yourself and passing it on to the cashier, everything would be perfect ?...well actually they forgot one item in the sandwich...no big deal and didn't ruin my day or anything...but then what's the point of the \"personalized\" paper bag and the sharpie and the do it yourself...and the sandwich is not cheap either...$ 6.00 for what it is...

Quality of the sandwich ? I would give it a C...there is nothing that made that sandwich superior to others in terms of quality of the bread and ingredients.

Despite just being opened just a few days....I just don't get it..! Their slogan besides their name mentions: \"Superior sandwiches.\"...I can't say I was blown away or anything...I wanted to give them a try to show my support and to break the Subway habit a little.

Two things that I feel that Which wich needs to work on are speed and staff friendliness. I imagine that on busier days, it would take a lot longer to get your order, so I guess I won't bitch too much for my 10 minute wait. I know I can be a diva sometimes, but they've only been open 4 days so I'll give them a little slack. Okay, you get to keep the personalized bag and use the sharpie to then doodle and wiggle to your heart's content on the bag how you feel that day, whether you've been cheating on your wife, or committed any other mortal sins...and then guess what ? you get to hang your very own sandwich bag on the wall. Yippie! I wasn't feeling very gay that day so I opted not to join in the challenge...

Oh! last but not least...! They've got newspapers for you...! Another Yippie...to make up for the wait...and there's also a television...! Hmmm, would you mind considering the addition of internet access and maybe a hot tub ? :-)"}
{"text":"I have to write this update on Which Wich, because I've been here a few additional times now since my first visit.

-They've updated their rewards club/punch cards which is great. We frequent Which Which often before or after getting groceries, so it all adds up quickly for free subs.

-The friendly employees do not go unnoticed. Every time we've been there we are greeted, asked if we have any questions, and overall see employees working hard whatever the task is they are doing. I know this is a fast food place, but I've noticed that the young workers really do a great job!"}
{"text":"Order our sandwiches and they got one of them wrong because it was supposed to be cold. Sent it back. We waited 20 minutes for them to remake it because they sent it to the back of the line even though I said we came in before anyone here. So I ask and he's says \"oh you're  still 4 behind\". Finally we get the sandwich and it still comes out hot. Offered to remake it and I said no I dont feel like waiting at the end of the line again. We end up taking it, but we are not happy with the service we recieved."}
{"text":"Which wich should I talk about first?  Jaaaay kaaaay.  I'm being silly.

This is a great place to stop by for lunch.  This one is located at the Metropolitan area, so I know that people might complain about the whole parking situation.  If you're already shopping in this area, I highly recommend stopping by.

When you walk in, you'll be able to see the menu on the right-hand side.  Note to not stand in line just looking at the menu, you'll have to grab a brown paper bag to fill out your order!  I didn't know that, so I stood there for awhile until I finally realized what the dilly-o was.  Whew!

The staff is pretty nice.  The food is good.  ALL the times I've been there so far, I've only ordered the Buffalo Chicken wich.  Pretty good.  I can't seem to stray away from it.  Beware though, if you go right at lunch time, it'll take a while to get your order.  I learned to just go either early or later for lunch.  

All in all...a nice place."}
{"text":"Am I the only one who suspects this place was established around a catchy kitschy business name? 
The Last Thing I want to do when hungry is try to navigate an overly complicated sandwich making-and-ordering system! Not very straightforward. I got a caprese (veg). The sandwich was good, I'd compare it to Potbelly's? Maybe kinda? But potbellys is quite a bit better."}
{"text":"Talk about an owner that loves his business! He noticed my girlfriend and were confused and gave us incredible recommendations! The first words out of Sydney's mouth were \"this is actually AMAZING\" mine was a tad spicy, but I didn't stop eating till it was gone! I eat local and shop local and this place is for sure a new spot for me!! Andrea at the register, when I got the complimentary chips for checking in was so sweet and just gave me chips with a smile  I'll be back for sure and I'll be spreading the word!"}
{"text":"This place competes for one if the best sand which shops on this side if town. Staff is very upbeat, a nice break from the typical chain 1000 yard stare by the employees. Sandwiches are fully customizable and fresh. I've been here 4 or 5 times and it's always good."}
{"text":"I love these guys! They're so kind and amazing and I always love coming here and seeing the staff. The sandwiches they make are really good and you can see and taste the quality ."}
{"text":"It's okay. Would prefer a different sandwich place. I suggest a hot sandwich with a lot of fresh ingredients instead of a plain basic sandwich. I got a turkey one and I might as well had gone to jimmy johns. It's like a sub bread. 
Nice and helpful employees though."}
{"text":"Update: 
Changed from 2 to 3 stars for the nice email the manager sent through Yelp. That always earns my respect. I will give it another try and submit another update afterwards.

Original review: 
I wasn't sure whether to rate this place 2 or 3 stars, but ultimately the cost of the meal made me decide on 2.

My son and my boyfriend's roommate REALLY like this place, so we decided to try it. I wanted so badly to agree with them, but I just can't. I love the cute name, the concept (so many options!), the friendly employees that seem to rather enjoy working there and Mellow Yellow being available, but that's about it. I had a roast beef, turkey and bacon sub. The b/f had a chicken pesto sub. They weren't BAD, just not very good for the cost.

The things I didn't like: 
-The iced tea isn't fresh brewed.  :/ At least it's Gold Leaf and not Nestea.
- The bread, the thing that MAKES a sub great (IMO). Not very good, tasted like what I could buy at the grocery store.
- The turkey wasn't the best quality.
- Forgot my crispy onion strings (I opted not to complain, they were busy).
- THE COST! OMG, THE COST! $27+ for a medium and large sandwich, plus 2 large drinks. If the sandwiches were amazing, I'd say it was still pricey but worth it on occasion. This was unfortunately not worth it.  :/

Jersey Mike's still reigns supreme for me."}
{"text":"I couldn't be happier that I found Which Wich.  I am incredibly impressed by the food, the value for the money, the friendly and helpful staff, and the overall atmosphere.  

This place makes some of the best sandwiches (and wraps, and bowls) you'll ever have, and with the amount of possible choices and combinations, it's going to take me a while to get through them. But it's going to be fun trying."}
{"text":"Great concept. Have it your way...wait...where have I heard that before....Which wich has my vote- hot or cold sandwiches however you want it. My sandwich is a ham with mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, cucumbers and avocado on a wheat roll. Only complaint was the roll was not that great. I see that they are offering Amoroso's rolls for their cheesesteaks but you have to pay $2 more.
Amoroso's as anyone from back east knows- they are the NINJA of rolls. Next time I 'll try them to see how authentic they are."}
{"text":"This is a must try. My sandwich was perfect. Just as I requested on my bag. (If you look at TH's review, I got his sandwich and it was delish) Thanks Todd! We got some of their home made chips and they were meh. Brownie was good. Not too too.  No one was there to help new people so that was a little awkward.We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I wanted to absolutely love this place, but it was okay. I like the concept and all the options that you can choose from.  It just did not wow me. I had the vegetarian sandwich and it was just okay. Maybe there are other sandwiches with me or different sauces would've been better. 

It's worth trying again I suppose. I did like that you can order online, but when I got there my order I didn't feel like they were helpful with telling me what I needed to do to get my food. I waited for the pick up was and the young man making sandwiches didn't acknowledge me. So I waited until I realized that my food was probably just back there ready to be picked up. I had to get his attention and ask him if they had my sandwich ready at first he couldn't find it but finally figured out it was hanging on the hook behind him. 

Not a huge deal but the reason I order online so it's ready and I can pick it up quickly, I have an hour for lunch, and I tried to avoid extra wait time. 

So I will probably go back and try a different combination of things on my sandwich."}
{"text":"Great sandwich spot, a zillion options to satisify any person. I always make a buffalo chicken sandwich, so good (little salty thou from the hot sauce and meat)... Id pass on their homemade chips, they are good but its a small portion for the price. They are quick to get the sandwiches out which makes it good for lunch. The shopping plaza is a PIA getting in and out during lunch thou, have to go early or late or deal with trying to park."}
{"text":"Where to begin... This is the second time I've been to this location. I can't knock the food;it's food. It fills a hungry tummy just fine. But the cleanliness of this place is just absolutely non existent (see photos). I'm giving it 3 starts because the food was okay, minus the fact that the barely legal to work employees slopped the sammy together. It was drenched in vinegar & so layered with hummus that the thing didn't stand a chance as a hand held food...tragic. I just couldn't eat it though because the whole place was disgustingly dirty! Rather than wipe a table the kids hung out in the back, eating, discussing who invited Lauren the other night. At least three different kids walked into the dining area to refill their beverage while we were there (and we were the only people there so no excuse about waiting for customers to clear out). Man, if I were management I'd hold an employee meeting, introduce the term inventory and cleanliness....we'll see. Actually scratch that: I wouldn't return nor recommend the place even if I won a contest that gave me free food for life. Nope."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot because my wife and I live down the street. Interesting concept of marking down what you want on the bag and then going to the register. The place was very clean and there was a guy that immediately wanted to know I needed any help with the ordering process. Everybody overall was really nice and helpful. Food took a little longer than expected but the place just opened so so big deal. Ordered a buffalo chicken, thanksgiving and caprice sandwiches. Honestly... it was not good at all. Very little meat and topping, was pretty bland but the bread was fresh and was pretty good because a good piece of bread makes the sandwich. I understand that this place just opened, but they are all over the United Staes and they have to be doing something right everywhere else. Will be back eventually but not for several months when they get there act together."}
{"text":"This is pretty much literally off of the light rail... so very easy to get to. Open 10 am til at least 10pm Monday thru Saturday and 10-6 on Sundays. Okay since I am assuming that most people reading this have never had the fortune to go to a Which Wich before. So let me explain. There are about 10 different bags when you walk in. Each bag will have a type of meat or category (seafood, turkey, vegetarian, breakfast, chicken.... you get the picture). There is also a gigantic menu above listing all the different types of sandwiches. Look which category the basic sandwich you want is at, then pick the bag. Then you choose which size you want. (small, regular, large, lettuce wrapped, or a bowl) Choose whether you want it toasted or not. Choose what type of cheese you would like as well as check all the vegetables and sauces and extras you would like on it. Write your name on the bag (and if you want to decorate the back you can see it travel the sandwich line) Then wait a couple minutes and enjoy your sandwich. It is really not that hard. It is just like Subway only you check the ingredients instead of tell someone. Only it is NOT like Subway as in it the taste and quality of the sandwich is out of this world amazing. I typically get the crab salad with avacado, and it never fails to be awesome. (also if you would like double meat or any other specials, you can simply write on the bag and they will be happy to accomadate your tastes.) Prices are $5.25, 8.50, and $11. You won't regret it, it is a huge gourmet sandwich that will blow your taste buds away. They also have a huge variety of shakes which are great, and their brownies will make anybody (especially a chocoholic) float away into heaven."}
{"text":"Honestly I am seriously in love with this place!! It is like Subway and Quiznos had a baby!! It has the ability to completely customize like Subway and it toasted like Quiznos but it has some unique options like caramelized onions, roasted red peppers and sauerkraut to name a few! I got the chicken on wheat and it was so good!! I don't know why I didn't come here earlier. I can't wait to try all of their options! I also am a fan of their machine that has 4 different iced tea options! It's nice to have an option that isn't soda or Powerade!"}
{"text":"My first time at a Which Wich was when I visited this location in August of 2017. As I've previously mentioned, vegan options in this area are slim, so I was happy to see that they had a black bean patty AND it was marked as vegan. I have since returned to Which Wich several times, the last of which was February, 2018. They serve consistently delicious vegan lunches. 

SUPERFOOD WICH -
Awesome for a light lunch. It consists of a vegan black bean patty, jalapeños, quinoa, hummus, and red peppers stuffed inside a spinach tortilla. It's so delicious that I ordered it two days in a row! 

BLACK BEAN PATTY -  
I've done a build-your-own vegan sandwich on several occasions, using the black bean patty. The following spreads/sauces are vegan friendly: BBQ, buffalo, dijon mustard, regular mustard, olive salad, hot pepper mix, hummus, oil, and balsamic vinaigrette. Add your choice of veggies & spices. Red onions, spinach, jalapeños, banana peppers, mustard, and avocado are my go to toppings. Their white bread is vegan-friendly.

I don't usually drink sodas so I'm happy to report that they have a fruit punch option. AND they have crushed ice (which is a big deal for us ice crunchers)!

{"text":"This place catered to my work last week and I loved it so much I had to go back this weekend.  I got the Wicked which is 5 meats and 3 cheeses, including bacon. Delicious!  Hands down, the best sandwich I've ever had.  Plus they have delicious cookies and shakes."}
{"text":"We go here about once every 3 months. I like there Cobb Wrap. I got it today and it was good but the bacon was very chewy. My wife's was the same way but she didn't really like her wrap. We ordered online and the food was ready when we got there and were treated with fast friendly service. Over a decent fast food restaurant. I will be back but his time I'll order my bacon crispy like it should be."}
{"text":"I've got to admit, Which Wich is my favorite sandwich spot in Tempe! The staff is very friendly and they always make my veggie sandwich right. My partner and I see the GM helping his busy staff all the time. He is also very friendly!"}
{"text":"I always go to Firehouse for a sub but went here from a recommendation. The whole setup is a cool concept where you're writing your order on your own bag and stuff but the sandwich itself was a big letdown. When I pay almost $15 for a meal, a cheesesteak sandwich, I really expect there to be two main things....cheese, and steak. Makes sense right?? Loaded with peppers and onions which is great, but still, no meat and cheese. If I knew how to attach a picture to this I would....wish I had my $15 back :-( so much for enjoying a cheat meal. What a disappointment"}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich place. I always get the turkey bacon ranch with spicy ranch and it is always amazing."}
{"text":"I am just happy there is something else to eat for lunch. It is a lot better than Subway. It is a chain, and that always bothers me. Doesn't bother me enough not to eat their food though. The process of ordering is cool, but weird. You can pick any combination of toppings to your sub that you wish at Which Wich. I ended up having a turkey on wheat, toasted with tomato, onion, hummus, avocado ($1 extra), oil & vinegar, oregano, salt & pepper and lettuce. It was very good. It came to around $6 for a 7 inch sub. I will come back and try more. My friend ordered the Italian two days in a row and enjoyed it both times."}
{"text":"This place is just okay to me.  I like the fact that they offer lettuce wraps.  I think the meat and toppings are fairly fresh and average for this type of deli/café.  It isn't amazing and it isn't brutal.

I will advise to stay away from the avocado.  It was brown and bland.  Disgusting.

Also, the bacon is really bacon bits that taste like plastic.

Everything is pretty generic, nothing is special."}
{"text":"I absolutely love wich wich. The staff is always friendly and the service is speedy. On top of that, the sandwiches are excellent. I got buffalo chicken with buffalo sauce and blue cheese (toasted) and it was killer. The sandwiches are well constructed; a bite won't send all the contents launching out the other end, and they seem to put particular care into layering ingredients evenly. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Which Which, but was pleasantly surprised with the operation! 

Think of Potbelly, but a little more customization. You grab a bag from the wall and check everything you want on your sandy. Do you want red onions, mustard, swiss cheese? Just make a check and don't forget to add your name! Bring your filled out bag to the cashier and pay for your order. In no time your order is up and you'll be enjoying your personalized sandy!"}
{"text":"I really love this place! The staff who are hipster high schoolers really are so nice and knowledgeable! I like the ultimate which with avocado. Make sure to sign up online to get a free drink & meal on your bday! also, if you are feeling adventurous or love bacon they have a bacon milkshake.... I haven't tried it but. Hey it's there!"}
{"text":"Poorly put together sandwich and bad flavor. This is the third time my husband and I have tried this place and the third type of sandwich. This is also the third location we have tried,  thinking maybe it was just the type and place we had ordered from before that wasn't very good, but no. We will never go back here."}
{"text":"Love the idea & enjoyed my sandwich. I am a fan & will be sure to remember this spot when I want to create my own sandwich!"}
{"text":"Which Wich is the question. Too many options but all I can say is every one I have ever had has been great!
This was my first visit to this location, at 11:45..lunch time in Uptown. Although I arrived just before the rush there were definitely several people there. 
After selecting my sandwich, and completing the sections, or so I thought, I headed to place my order. After getting to the counter I realized I didn't complete everything, my bad, and was also given an option to get one of their sandwiches minus one thing which would save me money, rather than creating my own. Love that they made me aware of that.
Less than 4 minutes later my name was called and my hot sandwich was ready. 
The 7\" inch sandwich was huge, they definitely don't skimp on the proteins. 
So glad this option is now uptown and I will definitely revisit. With great sandwiches and customer service how could you go wrong."}
{"text":"I arrived shortly after 11:30 and there was a great crowd, good sign.  Upon entering the store I was greeted by an employee who explained the sandwich process.  Grab a brown bag, with multiple selections of bags, Turkey, Seafood, Breakfast etc. Upon selecting your \"meat\" bag, you can choose from one of many pre-menu sandwiches, i.e., philly cheesestake, or create your own. I created my own, Turkey, Bacon, Swiss, Mayo, Lettuce and Tomato, heated on wheat bread.  Wrote my name on the bag and proceeded to the checkout line.  While I waited I continued to see how friendly the staff was and how attentive they were to new customers. My sandwhich was to go, but I immediately dove right in before I even started my car. Delicious.  The bread was toasted to perfection, with a great amount of turkey and bacon.  Although the previous two sandwhich stores in this location didn't make it I have faith Which Wich will.  Great customer service and great food, Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and overrated. My first problem was with customer service. I had never been in before and was not greeted by either employee or provided any direction on where or how to order. My second problem: the house chips were good, but the portion size was way too small for the price. My third problem: I ordered the Cobb wrap, which was also too small for the price and it was missing a main ingredient (the blue cheese). It is unlikely that I will return to which wich based off of this experience."}
{"text":"I am so happy Which Which now exists in Northeast Ohio. Which Which isn't a place you frequent if you just want an average sub; come here if you are craving something out of the ordinary. They offer dried cranberries, fried onions, walnuts, and almost every type of sandwich dressing you can think of to top off your sub. I personally like the Thank You Turkey, which is a thanksgiving meal packed into a sandwich. This isn't an everyday kind of lunch place. Two small subs, two cookies, and a drink to share ran us over $15, but it was worth it for the novelty.

If you're feeling guilty, the milkshakes and cookies are also very good. (The cookies come out toasty too!) The house chips were a little off for my taste, but who really goes to a sub place for chips?

My only complaint and suggestion to this location is to have your staff be aware that not every person has been to a Which Which before. While I had heard legendary tales of these fully-customizable subs, I really didn't know I had to grab a bag and sharpie things up. My SO and I stared at the counter for a minute before we finally caught glimpses of the paper bags and markers behind us. We were greeted, then promptly ignored as we stared blankly at the workers."}
{"text":"This place is very good for s quick, affordable sandwich. I'm sure there's better sandwiches out there for more money, but this beats the pants off subway, Quiznos, any of those. Definitely recommend toasting your wich."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Which Wich, so I was excited to find one in Madison. I think the concept is fun and the food is usually quite delicious. With so many options, everyone is bound to find something they like. They keep a lot of other aspects about the restaurant fun too, like the names they give their sandwiches.

Another attraction: they cater to vegetarian, gluten free, dairy free, you name it! In addition to many veggie options, they also have a lettuce-wich, canceling out the bread.

Last visit, I got the hummus-wich, with some pesto and olive salad added. It was great! Side note: even the medium size is actually big enough for two meals. I am scared to order the large.

One thing I think they could improve on: clearer instructions for how to fill out your order and the order in which you're supposed to do it. Since the concept is quite different from other sandwich chains, it would be nice it there was a 1-2-3 diagram outlining what to do.

Cheers Which Wich, I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I had a sandwich delivered via Door Dash and the sandwich was awesome. Exactly what I ordered and was excellent. Great food and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"I love this location-they seem to prepare the best sammies.  I love the Chix Pesto with all the goodies, including hummus.  Their rewards program is a nice incentive.  As our their Bag 8 limited time specials."}
{"text":"$15 for a med sub, chips and soda? I got charged twice for chips this place sucks & the sub wasn't that creative nor great Safeway has better sandwiches for under $6"}
{"text":"Closer to 3.5 than 3, sandwich was good, but explanation and help of staff gets the stars. Could have been more turkey on my sandwich, but made as ordered and tasted good."}
{"text":"When I found this place on Yelp and looked at the menu I was so excited to try it; way more than someone should be for food. :p I'm a toppings gal so when I saw unlimited free toppings I was excited! So I placed an online order that I paid for online and went to pick it up. Per the email I received I was to go straight to the pick up side. Well I did and got ignored by the guy behind the counter for about 10 mins as all the other people in line who had to order and pay got their food. I finally went to the order side and told her I had an online order. She looked at me like I was a dummy and told me to go back to the guy. -_- Only then did he address me and gave me my order that had been sitting there the whole time. Not a good way to start this out...

So got the food back home and was anxious to try my concoctions. I ordered 2 sandwhiches so that I could try 2 different kinds and then eat the other halves the next day. Well the sandwhiches are huge so I could barely get down half of one which is good. I ordered the Elviswhich...PB, banana,  honey, and wait for it...bacon! Tried a bite and it was good but rather dry.  I opened it up and there was one little dab of PB in the middle (pics included). I had to go add some of my own PB. Otherwise it was amazing. Then I tried a blt that was stuffed with I swear half of the 50 toppings available. It was pretty darn good! I also ordered a side of the house chips. Well I got a sad little plastic baggie filled with crushed potato chips. Boo. My friend ordered the meatball sandwhich. She said she didn't think it was beef and that the meatballs were gray. She said it was awful. :/

I would like to give this place one more chance and see if I can rate this 4 stars next time. Hopefully the food and customer service will be improved."}
{"text":"I love Which Wich; however, this location is giving the name a poor reputation.

No red opinions. Card reader is down. Poor energy and lack of customer service. Overall a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"*Customer Service 1/2 Stars, Nothing crazy here but also nothing to complain about.

*Experience 1/1 Star, Not very busy when I went so it was quick and painless. 

*Food 1/1 Star, absolutely love which Wich, by far my favorite sub compared to its competitors!

*Would I Recommend 1/1 Star, Would definitely recommend if you have not had them before, all subs are toasted unless you ask for it to be cold."}
{"text":"This place is far over priced for the food and service you get. The staff got both sandwiches we ordered wrong, they were out of product and didn't let us know until our sandwiches were done, and they had no straws for drinks and offered opened straws where everyone's hands touch. I've been to this location a few times and it just seems to get worse and worse which is too bad because how can you go wrong with making a sandwich!"}
{"text":"I revisited Which Wich.  I had no plans to do so, but my kid was having a bad day and wanted to go there (she thinks that all food places should make you write your order on a bag now...).  

Nothing had changed since my first review, but I ordered the Gyro sub this time.  

Now, I'll go a good distance for a solid gyro. They're one of my favorite entrees. I love a really good gyro.  The gyro sub at Which Wich is entirely solid. The meat was nice and flavorful, the tzatziki was creamy, but delicate. The fact that they served it on a whole wheat bun (because I asked for it), did no damage to the overall familiar gyro flavors, and I have to say that I was pretty impressed by it. 

I wish they'd put in a few more comfortable seats. The stools at the tall tables are horrendous. I just stood to eat instead, given that all the normal tables were taken.

It's still just a sandwich shop, but I'll be going back if for no other reason than to get that gyro sub."}
{"text":"Which witch cursed this location and made the service slow and the food subpar? I've eaten here twice and both times it took forever to get our food despite there not being much of a line. They've also messed up my order both times, making me not want to return. Somehow my coworkers still like the sandwiches here - I'm not sure why since it's not much above Subway. The salads have been awful and the sandwiches not much better."}
{"text":"Which Wich has a wonderful span of sandwich options   The concept is quite simple, though it took me a bit to figure out what I needed to do before I started.  First, pick one of 10 bags that represents the core of your sandwich (chicken, ham, veggie, tuna, etc.)  Then, fill out the options with a Sharpie.  (details here:  http://www.whichwich.com/menu)  Different sizes of sandwiches are available only if you use bread--lettuce wrap and salad bowl options come in one size.  I opted for a chicken lettuce wrap with hummus and all sorts of veggies added in.  It was very flavorsome and quite filling.  

 I observed a very friendly store manager greeting customers as they entered the restaurant.  He was quick to assist rookies with the bag selection process.  Later he chatted with customers and asked how their lunch was after they completed their dining.  It's nice to see old-fashioned friendliness from a franchise owner!  Kudos to him!

Tasty deserts are offered so don't forget to save room for a cookie or an ice cream cookie sandwich."}
{"text":"What a clever concept for a sub shop. Admittedly, it can be a bit overwhelming at first, but the 'Make Your Own Sub' thing they have going here is very clever. I really liked that I could choose and pick at my own leisure without feeling rushed at all. Great choices for toppings and sauces and you can just Go To Town on it. Excellent.

And when my name was called (I put 'Bruce K' on mine, but you might want to go with 'Voldemort' or 'Bond. James Bond.') the sub was exactly what I requested. And it was excellent!

Free wifi. 'Frequent flier' card. Lots of seating inside and out.

I could see coming back here often."}
{"text":"Once you get past the strange (but really clever) ordering system, Which Wich makes for a really yummy sandwich. It's not hard and once you get it, it makes a lot of sense.

Step 1. Figure out which protein you want in your sandwich. Pork, Turkey, Beef, Chicken, etc.
Step 2. Grab the appropriate bag and a marker.
Step 3. Work your way down the bag, x'ing off which cheese you want, what sauces you want, what veggies you want, hot or cold, extra meat. All of that is SO FLIPPING CLEVER. And you do it at your own pace.

When it's done, write a name at the bottom. Now, you could be normal and boring, writing your own name. Yeah, that's been done. But be outstanding and put something smart like \"Voldemort\" or \"Darth Vader\" or \"Bruce\"!

A few minutes later, your sandwich is ready. Exactly as you ordered it and wrapped up ready to go. Love it!"}
{"text":"You can't go to a chocolate event with an empty tummy, right? So I popped into this Which Wich for a quick bite and indeed it was a quick bite.

Especially since I understand how their ordering system works. First, pick your protein (like ham or roast beef or turkey) and then grab the appropriate bag for that one. Then work your way down the list, adding tomatoes and lettuce and cheese and mustard (different kinds!) and if you want it hot or cold.

I went with the \"Turkey\" which is bag number one. Add Swiss cheese, hummus, Sriracha, red onions, lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers. Cold. Yum!

The \"quiz\" ends with the hard part - a name. Should you go with your own name? Boring. \"Darth Vader\"? It's been done. Be creative. Everyone in the place is watching.

Then take a seat while your masterpiece is prepared. Eat. Clean up. Leave. Easy!"}
{"text":"I eat at the Middleton location a few times a month since I work nearby, and even when the line is out the door, you get what you want quickly and from competent individuals. This is definitely not what I experienced at the Sun Prairie location last night. 
It was two hours til closing, so I'm not really sure why all four employees looked at me like i had just wrecked their evening by entering the store. There was one couple in there already eating and other than that, it was empty. I filled out my bag for a hummus sandwich and took it to the front. The girl who rang it up glared at me when I said hi to her. She gave me my total before I could even ask for chips and a drink, and seemed exasperated when I did so anyway. Well, I'm paid and getting my drink and waiting for four employees to make my sandwich - the only order in the restaurant. Folks, this took almost 20 minutes. For some hummus and veggies to be spread on some bread. 20 freaking minutes. I took it home and opened it to eat as I'm starving now. Not one single veggie. I had nearly every vegetable on my bag marked, and all I got was hummus on bread. No cheese. No dressings or sauces. No veggies. NOTHING. Four rude employees. 20 minutes waiting in an empty shop. Nothing on my sandwich. This place is awful and I will never return."}
{"text":"Girl working the register & sandwich line made extremely cruel remarks about my boyfriend who was talking on his cellphone while I was standing there waiting for him & for my sandwich to get made.  Obviously she had NO idea that he was with me.  It is a shame that 1- she does not know who her customers are & 2- she was more interested in running her mouth to her co-workers than work.  She was incredibly offensive.  Which Wich on Woodlawn as lost 2 customers."}
{"text":"The children and I opted for some quick sandwiches.  After reading about Which Wich on Yelp earlier that day, we headed over.  I like the concept of writing out your own sandwich.  This should keep you from having errors on your order.  The kids were excited to place their own orders and to draw a picture and add it to the window!  We ordered three toasted turkey sandwiches and the youngun' ordered PB&J without the crust.  The orders were returned in a reasonable amount of time.  The kids were estatic about their sandwiches and the delicious Garden Chips we purchased as a side.  The sweet tea was satisfactory as well.  Rob B. mentioned large portions of meat but my husband mentioned the lack thereof.  I dug through my sandwich and found there were perhaps two very thin slices of turkey tucked beneath the fresh and crispy veggies.  That said, perhaps I will go with a veggie sandwich on my next visit."}
{"text":"Do NOT try to call. The phone number is disconnected. 
Service is slow. 
The food is good but be prepared to wait. There's other options nearby."}
{"text":"Ordered totally messed up my order will not go back. Ordered the Wich sandwich with everything , morons didn't add lettuce or tomatoes and the bread was stale don't waste your time"}
{"text":"Loved this place! What a unique place to grab a sandwich, best thing of all i don't have to talk to anyone about what I want on my sandwich.. What I don't want blah blah blah.... Just give them the bag for the sandwich you want, fill out the ingredients, pay. And bam! Sandwich no questions asked. If you are looking for a good sub place and are close by, better stop at wich wich"}
{"text":"I work at PayPal, so I visit this place quite frequently on my lunch break. The menu, however can be a little confusing for a first-timer. What you have to do is grab the proper sandwich bag and fill it out. For example, number 6 is the vegetarian bag and then you look up at the menu and see what your options are. The vegetarian options are: hummus, mediterranean, caprese, and there's one other. You then fill out your bag on how you'd like your sandwich made. The first time I went I grabbed a bad that was like their ultimate sandwich or something like that, so when I got it, it was loaded with meat. Not so good for a vegetarian...lol. 

The last time I visited here I ordered the hummus sandwich with crispy onion strings, lettuce, jalapeno, banana peppers, salt, pepper, oil, vinegar, pickles, garlic powder, oregano, olives, and bell peppers. It was seriously sooooo good!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a sandwich. You really can't go wrong since the have a great selection of both meat and vegetarian options. You'll also find a great selection of toppings, where else can you get Red Onions, Crispy Onion Strings and Caramelized Onions on sub? Also, their Roasted Red Peppers and Hot Pepper Mix make unique toppings that you aren't likely to find many places.

Really what I find impressive though is how well balanced their sandwich comes out; it's a great blend of tasty bread, meat and toppings even when just ordering a turkey sub!

Also, I kind of appreciate balanced pricing. When trying to not eat too much and still wanting to be efficient on price for what you get you notice when the small is exactly half the price of the large while also being exactly half the size. Nutrition info with detail is available too. Size, price and nutrition info with tasty food, great combo."}
{"text":"I had never heard of Which Wich before so I assumed it was an independent company. What I discovered is that it is indeed a chain (be it a small one) trying to get that bit of the deli meat fast food business from the likes of Subway and Quizinos. What sets Which Wich apart from the competition is a more diverse menu as well as an original way of taking your order that set it apart from the competition.

The menu at Which Wich is divided into about ten categories, depending on your genre of meat. There's roast beef, turkey, vegetarian, breakfast, and more. Each category has several sandwich options listed under it. You will find both roast beef and corned beef under the roast beef section, and the \"ham and pork\" section has the ham sandwich, pulled pork, or \"The Hula\" which has ham and pineapple. 

Once you make your choice you don't go up to the counter to place your order. Instead you find a paper bag and mark all your choices on there. While Subway and other chains have one person taking your order and someone else asking you about what toppings you want and then a third person asking what you had when they ring you up, you don't necessarily have to talk to anyone (though if you don't at least say howdy they may think you're rude.) So this little paper bag has your sandwich choice, the size, the bread, the toppings, the dressings, everything you could possibly want. Don't like tomatoes on your sandwich? Then just don't mark it off, and you won't have to pick them out afterwards! You hand the bag to the cashier, they send it down the line to the sandwich makers and you pay there. When you're meal is ready they call your name out (there's a space on the bag to write your own name) and you're on your way. So they have an interesting way of serving you. Does the food make the cut as well?

Yes and no. The menu is pretty extensive for a chain deli shop and you will have more unique options here than the other guys. The cold cuts are of a much better quality than you would expect from Subway but they don't exactly match up to Boars Head cold cuts you would find at an actual deli or cafe. The veggie and dressing options are numerous and the veggies tasted pretty fresh and crisp. The portions of the meat and veggies are also more than you will get at the other places. One thing I did like was their chips that they make fresh daily. They are simply just salt and pepper ridged chips but the fresh fried sure beat a bag of Lays any day. They also serve milk shakes but I have not tried them yet...I don't exactly consider a milk shake a beverage option (it's a dessert!)

The service is pretty quick as you don't have people trying to explain what they want and don't want to the cashier, and the assembly line set up works pretty smoothly. Your first time there may be a bit confusing if you're not entirely ready to check off what you want on a bag but the cashiers were more than willing to come out and help newcomers at the bag station. The prices are a bit more than you would spend at the other fast food sandwich places but the quality is a bit better. It's a very good lunch option if you're in the Birkdale area."}
{"text":"We came here after work...I was so happy that I found a which which running distance form work! I went out on a limb and ordered the shrimp banh mi sandwich for $7.50 instead of my regular black bean patty. I couldn't help myself and added a small vanilla malt shake. 

The sandwich had great condiments and bread but I was disappointed with how soggy the breaded shrimp turned out. :( I was hoping for crispy shrimp like the picture portrayed. I ate it anyways...I was starved from a full day of work without food. The shake helped too..

I will be sticking to my black bean patty from now on. OOHHH, and if you have a punch card..theres DOUBLE PUNCH TUESDAYS! Score...Will be back, just not for the shrimp banh mi."}
{"text":"Lots of choices so pretty much anyone should be able to find something.  Can get any sub as a salad if you don't like bread.  Good set up and service.  Food is very good for a quick sandwich shop.  Cool place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I placed an on-line order for our company Halloween Party. I placed the order a week in advance and received a confirmation email, order number and store location.  The day of the party I called the store to confirm everything was in place and they told me they had no record of the order.  The Manager gave me a number to call for catering which was an invalid number,but I found the correct catering number and they told me they had to call the store.
Long story short - no record at the store of the order and they were unable to fill it - food is \"frozen\" was the excuse.    I was stuck with a room full of people and no food.  Which Wich employees showed little or no concern of the situation.  I schedule many company functions and I will never use this company again.  This was a total disaster and an example of an extremely poorly run company and store."}
{"text":"Nice choice selection for families- many options. One teen greeted us at the door and explained how to order- very friendly. 
But basically they were typical teen workers. ALL tables were dirty and the garbages overflowing- not busy at all, yet workers were just standing around talking or drinking soda. I imagine the owners would be angry to see it.
Sandwiches were OK"}
{"text":"I've been going to the Which Wich on Deming Way for roughly a year now, and I have to say they single-handedly changed my view on sandwiches.  That's saying a lot.

Personally, I'm not a sub guy.  I'm also not a sandwich guy.  But this place gets a lot of things right, and does things differently than other sub shops, so if you haven't been it's absolutely worth a visit.

The biggest issue for me that sub places have such as Subway or Cousins, is that they don't give you much in the way of choices, everything is pre-planned for the most part.  The other issue I have with them is that they don't use terribly well prepared or fresh ingredients.  Which wich solves both of these problems.

When you go in, there are a wall of bags and sharpie markers.  You pick the \"category\" of sub you want, of which they have pretty much everything you could ever possibly eat on a sandwich.  You then grab a sharpie and start filling out all the additions you want.  It's basically the \"Newegg\" or \"Legos\" of sub shops.  If you are a picky eater, there's no excuse here.  You will find something.  I practically eat a different sub everytime, yet at other sub shops I have a really hard time finding even one choice I like.

The meat is prepared better.  I don't know if it's fresher, or if it's that they have better cuts or practices than the way the other shops prepare their food.  But unlike Subway where your chicken looks like it was cooked, frozen, then reheated into a rubbery blob, you get finely shredded deliciousness at Which Wich.  They have a huge smorgasbord of toppings, sauces, and add-ons.  You honestly can't go wrong here.

Prices are elevated over the typical sandwhich shop.  Their sizes are small (7\"), medium (10\") and large (13\") with the range being something like $7-10.  Don't quote me on those numbers, but it's fairly close.  So yes, they are more expensive by a few bucks than the other chains, but the level of quality is so much better in my opinion that I'm willing to spend that minor difference any day of the week.  I'm not saying it's the best sandwich ever created on earth, but for a chain sub shop, this is the best I've had.

Customer service has been pleasant every time I've been in there.  I'm always greeted warmly and they are prompt at filling orders, even when busy.  No qualms there.

My only small knocks are that this is just a sub shop after all, and it's pretty popular so it can be a zoo in there at times.  They also don't have much at all in the way of sides, other than some chips and their custom shakes.  There's nothing to write home about there, but they are still tasty.

Normally I wouldn't review a sub shop, but Which Wich is something different and this was overdue.  Make a visit today"}
{"text":"Great lettuce wrap, very clean and modern interior. Had a turkey sandwich in lettuce, yummy!"}
{"text":"Usually service is great! But I came here before work today around 4:45 to get the turkey club. The guy at the register was very nice and quick, unfortunately after I paid for my order I sat to wait for my sandwich, waiting at least 10-15 minutes for my sandwich to even start getting made. Seeing as my ticket was the only one up there for a while this upset me. I heard girls in the back talking and laughing very loudly. So the line continued to grow as we were waiting to get our sandwiches made by the girls who were obviously preoccupied with other things in the back room.  After I finally got my sandwich and left, I opened it to find a messy sandwich barely held together. Very disappointed in my favorite sandwich shop. Will not come to this location again."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this new spot in the Mill Ave District. You order by filling in the extensive options on a paper bag which made it very easy to create the sandwich exactly how you want. This place can get very busy during the lunch hours; however, the ordering system allows the lines to move along fairly quick. I would recommend not getting the lettuce wrap option because it can be very messy. 

(Yelp check-in gets you a free bag of chips!)"}
{"text":"Excellent service!!!
Greets customers with a smile & acknowledged everyone walking in.
Sandwich is very clean & tightly wrapped. May need to hire more staff though."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for couple of years now and the food here is consistent. All the vegetables are fresh. I like that they offer more choices of toppings and sauces than their competitors. All the sandwiches I've tried are tasty. My current favorite is the BLT. I used to get Cuban sandwich all the time which is very good. 
I also liked the fact that the sandwiches can be kept in the fridge and it tastes just as good the next day. I just open it and toast it up."}
{"text":"Good spot for a classic sandwich. Definitely better than subway and some of the other chains out there. They seem to use fresher ingredients and put a little bit more care into the actual sandwich. Plus they have some unique sandwiches that other stores do not have."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE  
Ok, I am giving them a 2 for the food alone. I love my seafood sandwich. If it wasn't for the awful customer service I would have given a 5. 
With that said, this place used to be amazing. Lovely staff, great food. Now, I can barely stand to go in here. 
last time we were there about an hour before close we pulled up and one of the employees were sitting outside with one of his friends blasting poor taste rap music on the restaurants speakers. He then proceeded to ask my husband to race him in his car. Needless to say, we went somewhere else. 
Today, wasn't AS bad.  It just blows my mind when people work in CUSTOMER SERVICE and do not know how to great customers. He (Aloha was his name) did not even bother with a \"thank you have a nice day.\" 
There was also another girl in the back that peaked her head around the corner and went went back to do whatever she was doing. Btw, it was busy. 
I wish there was another location so I didn't have so come here. Sad to see such a cool place go downhill."}
{"text":"Decent food but horrible staff. Waited forever and had the bitchy staff run their smart mouth as I was leaving. I will not be returning and I will make sure to let all my friends know not to waste their money on a sandwich served with a side of attitude"}

Oh, Which Wich... What can be said about this sandwich joint?  You walk in, grab a bag, check off anything and everything you want, and sign your life away to whatever masterpiece you've created.  While I'm not bonkers or a crazed enthusiast of this joint like some of my other friends, I'll admit that they can make a delicious sandwich for a hefty price depending what you get.  Buy a cookie, a shake, and grab a punch card.  

The ingredients are fresh and everything I've ever had tasted decent.  Come here when you want to switch things up."}
{"text":"I just moved to CLT and a few of my friends talked this place up quite a bit. I went today. It was ok. Lousy bread held the sandwich back quite a bit. Interesting dining format if you dislike human interactions. Not a bad place but there are better options out there."}
{"text":"I want to check all the boxes... all of them. 

I have done so in the past, and they dutifully crafted a monstrosity sandwich made to order, to my absurd and unreasonable specifications. I love that.

Lots of great options, lots of good sandwiches, not a lot of seating and the seating that exists is small. I feel like there is a lot of temptation to avoid crafting a terrible for you sub that I seldom avoid resisting, therefore I make sure I go infrequently."}
{"text":"I popped into Which Wich on a weekday afternoon, almost empty. Having never been there before, I went to the ordering station - read a bunch of signs, wrote on a bag, and still completely bungled my order. So the guy just took my order audibly like Subway. 

I had a wicked sandwich - a bunch of seemingly random sandwich ingredients stuffed in a sandwich. It was good, flavorful, not as unique as I'd hoped, and a bit dry, but I'd totally have it again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! This is my favorite sandwich place! Everyone in there is super friendly and nice! Also their very quick! Highly recommend this place if your craving a sandwich!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I tried the Elvis Wich... yum!! The great combination of sweet and salty :) I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The sandwich was good! However, it took longer than 40minutes. After the girl didn't yell the order name, my sandwich had been sitting there for a while. When I realized that was my sandwich it was completely wrong. Had to wait another few minutes. Hire more people to fill in during rush"}
{"text":"Appears to have gotten better!!  Easy to place an order online and pickup at the counter.  Best toasted sandwiches!"}
{"text":"As a prominent sandwich enthusiast of Peoria, Arizona, I have never been more satisfied with my service. The customer service, particularly an employee named Emily, truly helped me with my confusion upon entering the business. She played an essential role in explaining the process, and paid excellent attention to my needs. The business itself was extremely clean, and I enjoyed how quickly my food was made. I will be returning, mostly in part for the service that the employees provided."}
{"text":"The ordering process was cool. But they butchered my sandwich. My husband ordered before me and got what he wanted. My order had what my husband ordered on it. Certain dressings make me sick and they included those. Did not add what I ordered. 
The lettuce tasted funny. After my husband ate his, he got sick.
We will not be going back."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at the Which Wich and I was favorably impressed. Two things a sandwich shops needs, a. be organized b. have a great tasting sandwich. Which Wich scores on both.
 
You grab a bag, and fill out the type of sandwich you want, what bread, toppings you want, etc. Then hand it to the cashier and wait for the sandwich. They were pretty busy, but the line was moving and they had plenty of seating. a. Organized. Check.

The topping selection was very wide, much more than typical. And for the sandwich taste?... Excellent. I had a Turkey on wheat, hot, with hummus spread, avocado, tomato, spinach. A small was plenty large for me. This was an excellent tasting sandwich. b. Check.

My daughter got a turkey club, and and vanilla milkshake. Also excellent. 

I also got the house chips. They were crunchy, not greasy, and spicy with just the right amount of salt and pepper."}
{"text":"I had the \"thank you turkey\" twice now and it was great. I love their ordering process of checking what sandwich and toppings you want on a piece of paper. The meat they used in the sandwich was definitely far above the caliber you would find at typical chain sub stores. My one complaint is that this particular location has prepared my order incorrectly both times I have visited. It seems to me there should fewer mistakes based on their ordering process. Regardless of the mistakes, try this place. It has quickly become a favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"We are regulars at Which Wich.  We have over 50 visits just this year.  We consistently wait for our orders.  Today's order took 31 minutes to get 3 sandwiches!  My lettucewhich was not wrapped properly so it was a mess.  

The wait is always this way.  People behind us got their food first.  Very frustrating!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It has become my favorite Sub spots. I always prefer online ordering rather than talking to someone directly and experiencing incorrect orders and continuously having to repeat myself. So the fact that I can walk inside to get fresh food and order by checking a few boxes on a bag just makes me so happy. Everytime i've ordered my sub comes out exactly how I'd like it. They are also fast and friendly as well. Also, the price is AWESOME! I can spend no more than $6 for a nice sized sub! I've also ordered a catering order from them and we were thoroughly pleased. They even provided plates and plastic ware. Before we left they went through the bag with me and made sure that I had everything that I needed and everyone LOVED the subs! I wish there were more Which Wich's throughout the state to replace Subway!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch because I was in the area and never been here before so I decided to try. It's a little confusing as to what you have to do to get your order in as a first time customer. I looked at the menu and figured out what I wanted and noticed sandwich bags but wasn't quite sure what exactly I needed to do. Got the attention of one of the girls working and she explained the process. Food for the price was a bit small. I got a philly cheesesteak and there wasn't a ton of meat on there and it was a very clean and healthier cheesesteak compared to ones I've had in the past. The bread I will say tasted really good and distinctly different from a lot of the other sub shops. Overall, it was ok but I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Downtown Matthews!  Who are you?  I haven't been around in a while, but now there's a \"North Matthews\" section that apparently sprang up over night with some mixed use commercial and residential areas.  This \"north end\" is where the Which Wich settled... I think it's a pretty good location.

Ample parking and lots of dining seats... this sandwich chain definitely makes use of its \"corner\" location with high ceilings and lots of windows.

Staff are friendly... though I think the one novel thing about Which Wich is that you mark on the bag what you want so there's basically no verbal communication between you and the staff (if you don't want to).  Online ordering is also an option.  

There's no going down an assembly line, picking and choosing how to make your sandwich... they just look at the bag and it tells them.  The finisher will \"yell\" your name, but you don't even have to pay attention to that because your name is on the bag and there shouldn't be any (if any) confusion on who's sandwich belongs to whom.

Nice touch in the dining area adding a candy machine.  I think for a couple cents you get to turn the knob and get a handful of candy for after the meal.  Kids love it... and there are plastic cups with lids that will house the candy after it is caught."}
{"text":"It's great having a ton of options for lunch when one works Uptown.  It's also good to see the unused space in the lobby of the Omni building finally get something in it- it basically sat vacant for the majority of 2015.

Anyways Which Wich is definitely a new concept that I embrace where you grab a brown paper bag with desired sandwich on it and customize the crap out of it, choosing toppings, how it's prepared (hot/cold), etc.

This location had been delayed for a while, but I think it joins the other two locations- one in Midtown in the Metropolitan and one in Park Towne off of Woodlawn.

They've managed to cram everything into a small space and have a small dining area of about 10 tables that fit 2-4 people.  Tables are bolted to the ground... So a little hard to push them together for big groups, but the proximity is there.

What's great is that you put all the info on your sandwich (or salad) on the bag and the cashier rings you up.  No more having to repeat your order or getting it wrong if they mis hear something.  I like that system... If your sandwich is bad- it's basically your fault.  

The last thing I'll mention is that their fountain drink machine has crushed ice so your drink gets super cold, super fast... Just keep this in mind if you are walking back to your building and you could not push the elevator button due to frostbite (this happened to a friend of mine... I think)...  Anyways... Good and quick lunch experience here."}
{"text":"So far we're big fans. We've been to this location and one in Scottsdale with the same good experiences. 

Pros
*A great selection of sandwiches and toppings. Also they are organized so you don't get overwhelmed by too many options like you might elsewhere. We will be back many times to try them all
*Interesting ordering system, customize your sandwich and grab a seat
*Tasty food- we've tried a few options now with no complaints
*Online ordering! Skip the wait and awkward misheard phone orders
*Welcoming staff always looking to help with ordering
* hot peppers on the menu!  I know I mentioned toppings but these get their own line

Cons
*Not as fast as subway but they tend to be busier and you don't have to wait in line, you can grab a seat and wait.
* Awkward ordering process if you're illiterate 
* the kids menu is limited. I wish it had it the options the regular sandwiches do so we could get a non-basic sandwich with the drink and side still."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak and cheese and the picture made it look like a juicy delicious sandwich with a lot of cheese and peppers.   The sandwich I got was dry,  bland and lacking cheese.  I thought it would have been way tastier. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"::Mainly focusing this review on Catering::

I have ordered Which Wich several times now at work for various meetings and events. So far, I have had no complaints and everyone seems to enjoy it. 

The sandwiches are pretty good. I wouldn't say they stand out necessarily, but they are tasty and people are satisfied. The wraps seem to be more of a hit with my group. Very yummy. We usually just get an assortment, and there are typically none left over, so all the various types are well liked. 

The pesto pasta salad is super yummy and a nice change to bring in every now and then. The fruit and cheese platter is AWESOME and always a big hit. It's really nice they have offerings like these instead of just the typical side salad. But don't get me wrong, the garden salad as well as the club (the only two we've tried so far) are also really great! Just nice to switch things up a bit now and then. 

Delivery has always been on time or early. Friendly drivers. Always offer to help set up for me. 

I will continue to order from Which Wich in the future :)"}
{"text":"Good subs. If you're looking for a change of pace from Subway and the like, try out Which Wich. Broad menu options and all sandwiches are fully customizable. 

I like their chicken salad and meatball grinder. Haven't really tried much more than that to be honest. They also have cheap peanut butter and jelly's that go towards the PB&J project...so kid friendly and charitable as well. 

The State St location is generally pretty clean and well stocked. I haven't found any of the employees to be particularly friendly there, but they're certainly not rude either."}
{"text":"What a Cute concept. Design your own sandwiches via sandwich bag. I've been to which wich at least 5 times and they never disappoint. The sandwiches always taste fresh and my order has never had any issue. Also they are quick if you're trying to grab lunch on a weekday."}
{"text":"I've been to this location more than any other, and I love coming back.  Great location right by AJs and friendly staff.  I will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"The best sandwiches as always, but the service was a bit lacking at this location.  They seemed to be having trouble with online orders and delivering them which affected the staff inside.  Perhaps they will improve with time."}
{"text":"Vegetarian: 
This was my first time visiting this location but I have been to the one in Raleigh before. I had avocado as my main item with several fixings.

Vegan:
Since you can build your own sandwich, they have a wealth of vegan options. 

Gluten-free:
You can choose a lettuce wrap so y'all are covered here.

Service:
At the front, you make your selections on a bag and then give that to a cashier. A line of people then prepare your food. I think this is a great way to do it because it cuts down on miscommunication. They prepared the food within 5 minutes and our cashier was friendly. 

Recommendations:
Everything about my experience here was great! The food was delicious and they make a successful effort to accommodate vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free diners. I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I love which which in Tucson, so excited when It came to scottsdale. I ordered my favorite sandwich in large and untoasted. After waiting 15 minutes for my sandwich, they gave me a small even though they charged me for a large and it was toasted. Guess I'll just have to continue to get my which which in Tucson."}
{"text":"Bumping Which Wich up to 4 stars as they seem to have overcome their early operational hurdles and, as the team has trained, the sandwiches seem to come out much more quickly when they are busy than back in the summer when they opened in Birkdale Village.  I wouldn't call it \"fast\" but it's certainly reasonable given the customer volume.  Quality is still quite good and there are enough options to make your head spin but all easily ordered with their bag and marker system.

I'm still a happy guy that they chose to replace the yucky Quizno's that used to be there with Which Wich!"}
{"text":"What a crazy name for a restaurant, but I can promise you that I won't soon forget that name!  I stopped in her for lunch with a friend today.  I thought the concept AND the name were pretty darn neat.

What makes this place unique is the way you order your sandwich.  You walk in and right there in front of your face are the brown paper sandwich bags with the \"order numbers\" on them.  On the wall above the counter, you find the type of meat/'wich that does with the numbers on the bag.  I thought this was pretty darned cool.  I don't normally eat a veggie patty, I love my meat, but I saw the pic of the \"How MeatLovers eat a Veggie Wich\" sandwich and I had to order it.  Bunless of course.

There are a ton of choices.  OMG.  The type of meat, then the add-ons, then the toppings, then the type of lettuce.  The type of bread. The sauce.  The blah blah blah!  I did load my bunless Veggie wich up with tasty things.  I got black bean patty - DELICIOUS and tasty.  I had a mixe of iceburg and spinach lettuce.  I added on the sauted onions, pepper mix, crushed red pepper sprinkles, pepper jack cheese AND the spicy ranch dressing (on the side).  I also asked for \"Oil\" on my sandwhich, forgetting I had checked the ranch dressing.  So I didn't eat much if any of the ranch, but it has a buffalo spicy taste to it.  

That was a top notch salad.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/which-wich-scottsdale-4?select=Sa9HaY0k4xe9GgnX5k_xQQ#_E8J_MqZtD8-Z4F_ywaSqg

I also grabbed a bag of their House chips... Very good chips.

Your kids will love the \"Kidswich\" ordering station.  the kiddos can grab a bag and place their order at a table that is kid height.  Perfect!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/which-wich-scottsdale-4?select=Sa9HaY0k4xe9GgnX5k_xQQ#nl3T91jvVh-ogUMsbRlzzg

It is TINY!  and it is also somewhat out of the way with it being on the other side of the 101 and not being right off the 101.  I would only come here if I were going to the grocery store in the same shopping plaza or some place else over there.  If I lived in the area, I would return, but since I don't, I probably won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich shops in Scottsdale. I come here about once a month and am never disappointed. I appreciate that customers compile their orders and write them on a bag prior to seeing the cashier as you don't waste time waiting for someone to figure it out as you wait. I usually order the Reuben or Superfood wich. Both are great. I get extra dressing on my Reuben and it tastes perfect. Their bread is toasted and really good. Most recently I've been ordering the Superfood wrap and it is healthy but reminds me of a burrito. I don't see myself stopping going here anytime soon as they are consistently good!"}
