{"text":"Our company had this truck booked a month out for March 31st. On the 30th Kenny emailed to say he wouldn't come out if it was raining. No contact from him at all today on the 31st and it wasn't raining at all after the early morning. We will not be giving him our business again."}
{"text":"Kenny is great.  I have had the opportunity to eat at his truck approximately five times over the past two years.  I have always found his food to be very tasty and reasonably priced.  Kenny is very reliable if you book his food truck.   One post mentions taking 45 minutes to get food.  Even when there was a line of customers, from the time I paid for my food until I received it, the longest I've waited was six minutes."}
{"text":"This food truck is a joke. Its not tex-mex, its bad gringo food.   The nachos I ordered reminded me of an internet video called \"2 Girls 1 Cup\". The only difference was is that what I ate wasnt served in a cup, it was served on a pile of chips."}
{"text":"KO was at the Steele Creek food truck rally and since Maki Taco wasn't there we decided to give them a try. We had the brisket tacos and the chicken tacos. Honestly, while tasty I was a bit underwhelmed. For $9 I would have liked to have had a side of something or at least have the drink included. It was just flour tortillas filled with the protein of your choice and  some veg. Overall it was tasty, but I'd probably choose something else for $10 (with drink) at another rally."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try the KO Tex Mex Food Truck on Saturday Night at the Lenny Boys Brewery Halloweird Party. The truck is owned by a man named Kenny Oakley. He came from Texas and brought Tex Mex here to Charlotte. We ordered an assortment of things from him, I had their Smoked Brisket, Very tender and flavorful!  We had the Flank Steak tacos, which was marinated grilled flank with Grilled peppers and onions and Cilantro Guacamole and queso fresco cheese. They were great! Next we tried the Tilapia Fish Tacos,  with lime cilantro coleslaw, and adobe crema.  He does a great job on all his food ..he has some great hot sauces too! If I had one comment to make it would be that he needed to add a little more meat on his brisket sandwich. It was a little small for 9 dollars..and it was so good I wanted more...Look for his truck KO at the Food Truck rallys!!"}
{"text":"Please, please, please don't waste your $. Possibly the worst food truck food I have ever experienced. Similar to other reviewer's experience, the food just did not match the wonderful descriptions on the menu board, at all. That is just wrong and not being truthful with their menu/product. Where was the chipotle sauce on the brisket taco because it wasn't any where near my tortilla, didn't see any relish on their either. Just over cooked, over smoked, inedibly terrible tasting beef (literally through the brisket taco in the garbage- I just couldn't power through it and took it down). The brisket tasted like you licked a grill grate, chewed on sponge, and then did a shooter of liquid smoke. I have been to Lockhart Texas and the many central Texas smokehouse places over the years. Billing themselves as Texas brisket experts is a disgrace. Same problem on the chicken taco. Below avg quality and the description just didn't match the bowl of food in front of me. For the prices that this food truck is charging they really should be ashamed of themselves- charging nine dollars for two tortilla shells with some below average proteins and some lettuce is a crime. They came to our neighborhood for a food truck night and I am going to strongly urge our community to not invite them back. Felt completely ripped off."}
