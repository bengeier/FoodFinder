{"text":"This place is so cool it defies description! It's one of the hippest coffee places I've ever heard of, so hip I doubt you'll even be able to find it. The coffee has a mysterious sort of flavor- enigmatic quality which draws people in. The ambience is a little crowded, but it gives the place and intimate, almost dorm-room like feel. The management are so passionate about the place they practically live thereI doubt you'll ever find a place quite like it!"}
{"text":"Probably the best place for coffee and fat hangs west of the I-17. Very home-y feel and there's always a great vinyl playing, from T Swift's 1898 to some good old Kanye. Definitely stop by La Chambre is you are fortunate enough to find it."}
{"text":"This is a great coffee shop and is a really relaxing place to hang out. The shop has such a vibey feel, and the coffee is miraculous. It's always a joy after a long day to head to La Chambre and enjoy some fine coffee while listening to Adele or the 1975 on vinyl. When you go, tell the boyz that Aaron sent you."}
{"text":"This is the best place to come and relax and talk with the boyz. Great food and coffee. Probably the best coffee and food shop around this area. I would highly recommend, if you can get in. Kind of like a speak easy, but bumpin' like a pub. You have to go!"}
