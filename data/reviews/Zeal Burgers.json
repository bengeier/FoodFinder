{"text":"This is by far one of the best burgers in the city.  I live in the area and been meaning to try these guys for a while now.  Finally went into grab their Zeal burger with bacon and cheese.  OMG!!!! This burger was juicy with tons of flavour and cooked to perfection.  That was yesterday and I went back in for another one today -had to it was too good.  Might even go back tomorrow for another!!! Very clean place and great service!! Highly recommend to any burger lover.   PS Ate it too fast to take any pics to post."}
{"text":"The burgers here are the best burgers I have ever had, to top it off the service is even better. I was in the car waiting and the cook brought us the food when he didn't have to. Overall I will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Zeal is AWESOME!  I've tried about every gourmet burger around and this place is at par with the very best!  ...and it's in Weston Village which desperately needs some decent local spots like this.  I've been to Zeal with friends and family a bunch of times now and it has been perfectly executed every single time.  The owner Mark is at the helm and cares about the quality and customer service and it really shows.  When asked where to eat for a birthday or special occasion my kids pick Zeal Burger!  Go to Zeal Burger - bring your friends.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The fried onions on the specialty burger was very tasty.  The owner has had a few decades at this location.  No wonder everything's so delicious !"}
{"text":"Excellent - so happy I discovered Zeal Burgers.  Much better than 5 guys or other places (and much more inexpensive - everything is included in combo!).  Meat is superb, bun is the freshest and fries are homemade, non-greasy.   The eating area is also extremely clean and cheerful. I don't live in the area, happened to discover it when I was visiting a friend but will certainly be travelling here all the time - certainly worth it."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience. The server/cook is such a friendly and caring host. He consistently makes sure that his customers are enjoying the food. He also makes sure the food is nice a presentable and treats every order and burger with perfection. I've tried The Heat and it's a pretty solid burger. It's a nice mix of ingredients. The fries were also pretty good. The area is spacious, clean and well maintained.   I've never met someone who is so dedicated to perfection when it comes to serving food. I will most definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The place smelled light a good burger joint when we walked in. Excellent Dunamis burger, cannot provide a picture because it disappeared too fast. Both the onion rings and the fries were good.   Clean, brightly light and clean, we are planning on coming back."}
{"text":"I was hungry for a burger but I did not want fast food chain quality, I was looking for something better and thanks to Yelp this place showed up and did not disappoint.   The seating area was spotless and my Z burger with fries was great and made to order.   It's too bad I don't live in the area but I will come back next time I'm passing by."}
{"text":"Great food for the price, convenient location & great customer service. Place was empty when we went in @ 5:30 on Tuesday. Got a burger each & fries to share. Huuge amount of fries for the value, food hit the spot. Will be back"}
{"text":"Just had my first ever Zeal burger - I never did a review before but I felt like I had too here!  From the second I walked in with my guests, we were greeted with a great friendly smile!!!  The burgers were cooked in front of us and looked soooooo good!!!!  The fries are cooked to perfection and the burger is definitely memorable!!!!  100% recommendation!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the \"Sorry, Eh\" burger with fries and it was a really solid burger. It was cooked perfectly with a nice fried eggs and their signature Z sauce is a much improved version of the Big Mac sauce. Their fries were a little bit bland, but still acceptable. Although a bit pricy ($10-15 usd) I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Burger patty is ground from AAA meat and made daily you can tell from the taste that it is fresh. Fries are not greasy. Burger was done right not overly seasoned or drowning in toppings. I can tell the cook/owner loves what he's doing as you can see and taste it in the food. Customer service was top notch, place is very clean. I live in Markham and will drive to this place again probably next weekend!!"}
{"text":"This had to be one of the best burgers I've eaten in a long time! Everything was fresh and very tasty. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. I would definitely recommend this place to people."}
{"text":"This place does not accept AMEX.  The people are friendly.  - Z Burger: for some reason, I thought this was NOT earth-shattering. Everyone else is so impressed. Either Canadians have low standards for burgers or my burger didn't have the Z sauce (in which case, shame on them for messing up the crowd-pleasing ingredient on one of their few signatures). The burger was good, but I've had much better all over America.  - Oreo milkshake: this was just okay. I wasn't blown away. I would rather get an Oreo Blizzard from Dairy Queen or something.  - Greek fries: do not get these for children because they don't smell that great. The flavor was pretty good in small doses, but the smell killed me. Moreover, I like my fries crispy and these were very floppy. They look like they've been soaking in the oil for hours before I wanted them. But the fries are pretty good for sharing.  I would rate them lower but I think somehow my experience was an anomaly. All the other reviewers were blown away."}
{"text":"Great fresh burgers seared on a flat-top, and excellent fresh-cut fries and poutines, served up by an owner who cares.  Freshly-ground daily, a 4oz. scoop of AAA beef is dropped on the flat top then smashed flat and seared until it's nicely crusted, then served on a sesame seed bun.   The beef is juicy and flavourful, but not dripping with grease, like some places. Mark the owner tells me that he purposely set out to make decadent angus burgers, trying to keep it healthy, without sacrificing flavour.  Their poutine is huge, featuring thinner fresh cut potatoes, double-fried and topped with legit fresh white cheese curds and delicious beefy gravy.    *Don't forget to check-in to take advantage of the 15% discount special.  In a city where gourmet burger places are popping up every day, this is one of the good ones. Definitely check it out and help keep this place alive, we need to keep joints like this around and successful."}
{"text":"Service: Bomb dot com; really attentive staff and they kept striking a conversation.  I think this is rare in Toronto and want to give them a big thumbs up for being so friendly (a gem!).  Food: The 'eh!' burger was really good, I love how the egg yolk just explodes in your mouth and that Canadian meat is screaming for attention lols.  Their Z burger is okay, but not something I would order again.  Their fries are cheap and you need to eat the small crunchy ones to taste full satisfaction lols.  The restaurant resembles that of a casual diner, love the atmosphere and you can park on the streets for free after 6pm!"}
{"text":"It's worth the ride to Weston. Hop on the UP Express, enjoy the comfy ride, or stress out in traffic on the 401. it's worth it because you will devour one of Toronto's best burgers (if not THEE best burger)! My personal favorite is the Zee Burger but the Canadian one with the egg is pretty awesome too! These burgers are done in the classic American cook top \"smash\" burger style. The best way to eat a burger!"}
{"text":"The dude here is the nicest guy. Knew everything about the food and made us feel welcome. Burgers were amazing and worth the extra money. Skip Harvey's for this."}
{"text":"Amazing tastee burgers and fries that will make u want to continue to come back for more and more.. super friendly atmosphere conveniently close to home which is a bonus for myself.. will definitely come back again and again lol"}
{"text":"This was one of the most deliciously fresh, perfectly cooked, flavour bursting burgers we've ever had the pleasure of eating!! This place is in the west end of town at Weston & Lawrence, very clean inside, friendly staff, and the owner is so passionate about his food which was really cool to see and was reflected in the quality and taste. We will be back again as this burger literally left us wanting more. With all the burger joints popping up in Toronto these days, Zeal is SO worth trying, it's a special burger!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars I most definitely would. I've been to a lot of burger joints in my days and this sits at the top of the list. Upset with myself that I'm just now trying this place out. A lot of love put in these burgers."}
{"text":"Had a Z burger with a fried egg and guac, one of the best burgers I've ever had the pleasure of devouring. The smell of those burgers on the flat top would make a vegetarian reconsider their dietary choices. I'm ecstatic that they opened a legit burger joint in the Weston and Lawrence area. I love the area, grew up there, so any new business, especially one of Zeal Burger's quality, is a welcome addition to the 'hood. Thumbs way up guys keep it up! You deserve every star. Believe the hype."}
{"text":"So I was randomly in the area, I had some time to kill waiting for someone so Zeal  Burgers was in area,  claiming they were great gourment burger and after having the Z Burger I cant say I disagree  The Z burger was a double cheese burger, two fresh grilled 4 oz patties, topped with their onion \"stringer\" Which is their take on mix between fried onion and onion rings, so it still is deep fried but not as large as onion rings, which is tasty add with their z sauce it was an amazing burger"}
{"text":"My wife and I were randomly  in the area to pick something up and Yelp+the craving for poutine on a cold winter day brought us here. What can I say? Mark G - the owner, greeted us and was happy to know that we were stopping by for the first time. We tried the signature Z burger (based on his suggestion) and also got a classic poutine. The burgers were spot on and absolulely delicious! They were grilled perfectly with the right amount of char and the toppings along with the special Z sauce put a big smile on my face. The poutine hit the spot! It's not often that you try a new place and leave feeling completely and utterly satisfied! To top things off Mark was extremely friendly and it was awesome to chat with him briefly on how the restaurant came about. It's always great to see restaurant owners pairing excellent food with excellent service and that was definitely evident with Mark! We will definitely be back and will spread the word :)"}
{"text":"Good food, good people, good prices. About 14$ for double patty and a couple extras and fries   The parking is a bit tricky if you don't wanna pay since the location is located on a main street"}
{"text":"Fantastic burger! Definitely on par with five guys and I would say it's even better. The z burger had delicious onion straws and all the ingredients were fresh. The texture of the patties were unlike any place I've ever been to, a must try!  Also worth a mention, the fries are very tasty (not greasy like most places). I didn't get a chance to try the Z poutine but it sounds like perfection."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with my girlfriend yesterday and it was the best burger i've had in a long time. Never knew this gem was located 5 minutes away from my house. Can't have burgers all the time but when theres room for a cheat meal, this is the place to go. Fresh cut fries and AAA steak burgers. The owner/manager there was fantastic, seems like a genuine real nice guy that is passionate about his food, i believe his name was Mark. The Z Burger is a can't miss!"}
{"text":"I read all the reviews and decided to give this place a try. Absolutely the best hamburger I've had in a long long time. Love the fries and the feta, the beef is grilled with a nice crust. Very friendly guy behind the counter, he walked us through the menu and made some recommendations. I am so happy that this place is so close to home."}
{"text":"Decent flavourful burgers, delish hand cut fries made from Yukon gold potatoes (yes, it makes a difference), and yummy desserts made by the owner himself. Mark is the man behind the smile, cash register, grill and the mop! Limited menu but flexibility to make your own creation. Make sure to hop on the free WiFi because it's not fast food. The burgers are cooked well done but not to the point that they're hard and dry. Clean and roomy dining area with paid street parking in the front. I would avoid rush hour times."}
{"text":"Best burgers in the city. Mark runs an his business with the utmost care and quality. Treats his customers with respect and delivers a quality product EVERYTIME. Z burger is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"First time trying this place.  Read the yelp reviews and it convinced my husband and I to come give it a try.  We ordered the Sorry eh and The Heat and a Poutine.  Both burgers were delicious.  Tasted homemade but better.  The burger meat was not overly juicy where your bun got soggy or that your toppings fell out.  It had the right amount of flavour where you could still actually taste your toppings.  The poutine was nice and fresh with the right amount of cheese and gravy.  The fries could have been a little more crispy but it was still good.  We would definitely come again and try the other burgers and definitely the milkshakes when it gets warmer outside. Also everything was reasonably priced which is nice in this tight economic city we live in."}
{"text":"Wow! Such a delightful burger! The z burger is da shit! The deep fried unions were a delicious touch. I will definitely be going back to Zeal Burgers! Killer burgers!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Got their Signature burger, The Z Burger but the mini one! Their Z sauce is like a Big Mac sauce but way better!! I wish I lived right next to this place. Can't wait to try the Dunamis burger next!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a long time. Quality meat and quality service. Beyond the regular smile and greet, the owner is 100% about his customers. I've been a couple of times now and each time, I've witnessed a regular customer that's treated with individual respect and kindness. Both times I've gotten the poutine and double patty with cheese, both times consistently excellent."}
{"text":"This was a really good burger. This neighbourhood doesn't have too many good places to eat so I am glad we got one.   The burgers are freshly ground everyday, they have awesome toppings and reasonable prices. I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Decide to try Zeal. So glad we did. Service first class food first class. Burger was so tasty. Juicy, high quality meat simply delicious. The poutine is phenomenal. The menu is just right. A must if you like burgers fries and great service. The owner knows how to do burgers and really knows what customer service is. Great food and great service !! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The best burger I've ever had and the hardest working owner I've ever met. Chef's poutine and the mini Z burger (one patty instead of two) are my absolute favorites. Also, the strawberry milkshake is sooooooooooo good."}
{"text":"Loved these burgers!  Fresh ingredients, flavours mesh perfectly for a mouthwatering experience.  My kids loved the fries and their cheeseburger. My husband devoured the spicy burger even though he \"wasn't hungry\" and I loved my feta.  We will go back often.  The owner is a great guy, made us feel really welcome as we had just moved to the city."}
{"text":"Smashed burgers done properly in the heart of Weston village. Very happy that we have a spot like this now in the area. All the right elements that make a great diner style smashed burger ( freshly ground steak on site, no fillers, execellent layer of crust on the patty, can't forgot to mention house cut fries ) . I opted for the signature z- burger ( double cheese burger with lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion strings,z-sauce)with an order of Greek fries( Caramelized feta,evoo, and what I think was tzatiki sauce, awesome) , my partner went for the sorry eh burger( bacon cheese burger, fried egg, tomato, onion string and z-sauce) with a classic poutine done right.  Definitely worth trying this place ."}
{"text":"Amazing place, great burgers, courteous staff and very accomodating. For very reasonabe prices!"}
{"text":"Finally checked out this place yesterday after hearing great reviews about it... and it did not disappoint! My husband had the Z burger, I had the Heat burger and we shared the chef's poutine. Everything was amazing!!! Patty was very fresh and cooked to perfection and the toppings just topped it all off! The owner and his father were both so fantastic and went out of their way to ensure we were enjoying everything! The place is very clean and lots of room for seating. The mama in me also noticed a high chair which is very convenient for families with babies/toddlers :) Definitely check this place out! Nice to see some good spots being put in Weston... will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Believe the reviews - great burger - done exactly as I asked for!  The owner is very personable - cheap parking behind the lot free on the streets after 4:00 pm.  Highly recommend this if you like burgers!"}
{"text":"Excellent and friendly service and even better burgers! Tried the Z-burger and it well surpassed my expectations. Highly recommend Zeal Burger."}
{"text":"This place has a quality burger and casual atmosphere. This is not a pretentious establishment.   I got the Z burger $9.60, fries $2.85 and a pop $1 = $13.45+tax. Total $15.20. You can pay with debit.   The Z burger tastes like a big Mac. Two patties, two pieces of bun. Comparable to Burger Priests California burger but bigger and a bit different. This is a better value. Flat top fry with a nice little crust.   Fries are good. Ketchup is ok. Only thing that would make this place better is different ketchup and malt vinegar.   I will come here again but plan to try a different burger next time."}
{"text":"This place is seriously AMAZING! Greek fries are bomb, the Heat burger is to die for and TRY THE OFF MENU MILKSHAKES!! Best burgers in the west end for sure! The owners / chef are also so friendly and great, big bonus."}
{"text":"Saw the Tasty Burgers review - went on the weekend;  I got the Z burger - excellent; I would compare it to a Chef made Big Mac"}
{"text":"This place is great. Awesome food and great service. Homemade sauce homemade burgers."}
{"text":"Wonderful service with a smile. The owner does everything himself (two thumbs up). One of the best best burgers in the city for sure. I wish they were open later though, just a thought."}
{"text":"Great Burgers in Weston! I compare them to Holy Chuck...such a pleasant surprise at a great price point! We would visit again!!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best burger joint I've ever been too, hands down! I came here a couple months ago for the first time. I ordered the Sorry Eh burger and told them I prefer no egg and they were more then glad to leave it out. The feta poutine was amazing as was the Nutella milkshake! Very friendly owner and the other guy was as well! Keep up the good work and wish you all the best in the future!"}
{"text":"Great Cheese Burgers at a fair price. We also had Fresh Cut Fries and Onion Rings that were really good. The decor is minimal with clean lines and no overcrowded table setups. The staff was really friendly and attentive. We are definitely fans."}
{"text":"First time here since the Sang's Chinese restaurant at this location closed. Nice 50's decor in Coca-Cola red, white and black. Black marble table tops and black metal chairs. The burgers are a 10 for taste, freshness, all fresh toppings and juiciness say both my daughter and I. My daughter loves the soft fresh sesame buns and wants to know where the owner buys them. The fries are the old fashioned hand cut fresh kind and yes, they do have malt vinegar as well as white vinegar, which \"chips\" IMO should have in a good burger place (daughter of an Englishwoman here). Quite reasonable prices. Single cheeseburger combo with a can of Coke or other soft drink $8.85. Add $1.00 for bottled pop. You order your burger & fries at the back counter and take your can/bottle of pop from the fridge opposite the counter. The owner says he's trying to cook things the old fashioned way and welcomes customer feedback. I wanted to try the dessert of the day but unfortunately all they had was Nutella milkshake, and I don't like Nutella. Apparently they had an Oreo cheesecake cupcake yesterday but were sold out of it. I gotta try that!"}
{"text":"Drove by this place before it opened then again noticed it has 5 stars now and 5 stars is what it deserves the owner is nice the place is clean and the z burger and poutine were incredible"}
{"text":"My roommates and I have been living in the neighbourhood for about a year now and finally got around to trying Zeals.   SO GOOD. I got Mini Z and my roommate got Sorry Eh and the burger was cooked so nicely and the Z sauce is truly an upgraded version of Mac sauce. I cannot wait to go back and try the rest of the burgers and even build my own.   The gentleman who took and made our orders, who I assume was the owner, was clearly so proud to serve his food (and rightfully so). He even gave us extra fries to really make sure we enjoyed the experience. The menu is priced so reasonably and toppings are so fresh. The fries are perfectly crispy and the perfect side. So excited to have this gem right in my neighbourhood.   (Side note, I have a dairy allergy and I always appreciate when establishments can accommodate me!)"}
{"text":"Really good burger and fries. Always fresh, you can tsste the quality of the ingredients. Reasonably priced for what you get. Will be a regular customer."}
{"text":"I had the build your  own burger and fries the food was very good. The owner was very nice I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times...the owner knows when you order a mini zeal burger as its not on the menu.  Mark always makes you feel warm and welcome and loves...and I mean loves what he does.  The food shows his care and devotion to the restaurant.  My only regret is not writing this on Yelp sooner.  Never been disappointed, food is fresh and perfect all the time.  I haven't been in about 2-3 months and the only thing that would make this place better is onion rings..which they didn't have the last time I went...hope he does or will very soon."}
{"text":"Tastiest burger I've ever had! I highly recommend this place, you won't be disappointed:)"}
