{"text":"I had a bbq craving and this was the closest thing around... We got the combo for 2... It hit the spot for being a chain.  The \"rich and sassy\" bbq sauce was preferred.

However, our corner booth faced nothing but the to go entrance counter. I had to watch the young blonde working repeatedly pull her hair out of her hair tie, shake out her hair then run her fingers through it... Then put together someone's to go order... Then apply lipgloss, then play with her hair, then dig a crumpled bag of Doritos out of the bottom of her purse for a snack... Then play with her hair while texting.

If this is what goes on in front of customers, what happens behind that wall?!

Gross."}
{"text":"The food was excellent but the prices are a little steep! If you got the amount of bbq for the price they charge it would be ok but I didn't get what I paid for. I understand that it comes with sides but i'd rather have more meat than fillers."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant I've given 5 stars to. I'm from up north and we had a few of these guys around where I lived and was bummed when I moved to the Carolinas and there were none. The Carolinas have a few good BBQ places, but they aren't FD. I was ECSTATIC to learn there was finally a FD by Carowinds. 

I feel like they've made some updates since the last time I visited. First they have some vegetarian-friendly items (which is something they lacked before which is why I was only able to go once in the past five years - my wife is vegetarian). Second, the staff is super friendly. The manager (don't know his name. He's a bearded dude) is the right guy who clearly sets the tone for this location. They've built a great team. Everyone pitches in to help so it's super efficient. 

Ok onto the food - that's why you're here. I used to only get the wings (best wings in my opinion - very little fat. Great sauce, though they've since added more so it complicates things a bit, but they do have great BBQ sauces now and you can order the wings naked) and the hot link sausage. I've only recently tried the brisket and OH MY GOSH. It was so flipping good. The first time I went it was moist and fell apart. Every piece had so much flavor I almost cried. The second time I went it was a bit dry but still good. 

The cons - it's pretty pricey so I only go at lunch. Their lunch specials are a really great value. The other con is that every side is very blah - the mashed potatoes didn't have any flavor, the jalapeño Mac n cheese is ruined by the presence of jalapeños - just make some great unhealthy Mac n cheese (like baked m&c with breading) and we'll be good. My wife said the corn on the cob is too soft/spongy.

So despite the lackluster sides and high-ish prices (dinner), it still gets 5 stars as the only place I'll go to for BBQ from now on. Oh yeah, their bread pudding...it's slap yo mama good."}
{"text":"Cool little spot next to carowinds. My husband had a chicken sandwich with onion strings and cheese on it. He liked it alot. The mac n chz was different.  Had jalapenos and corn in it. It was pretty good. I had bbq pork nachos. I advise everyone who goes there, not to get those. The cheese was cold shredded cheese, not melted at all. I asked my waitress if that's how its suppose to come, and she said yes.  They should definitely let people know when ordering them. I've never had nachos with cheese not melted on them. Such a weird way to ruin nachos. There are more things on the menu that look like they would be a better choice.  I really wish I remembered the name of our waitress. She was very friendly and the place had a nice upbeat environment.  We will return, but definitely not for bbq nachos"}
{"text":"Before even walking in the front door you're hit with the wonderful smell of cooked meats, walking inside it only got better. The interior of this location was certainly different than other Famous Dave's I've visited, more of a modern trendy vibe than the country saloon style I expected. We were seated right away and had our drink order taken by our server Val. Super polite and friendly, answered all our menu questions and kept our drinks (like the wonderful sweet tea) full the entire visit. My order consisted of the seasoned chicken tenders, Georgia chopped pork and firecracker green beans with a cornbread muffin. The chicken was nice and juicy, but the dry seasoning/rub is what really sets them apart from your average chicken finger. I haven't been to a Famous Dave's in years, but they were just as good as I remember. Pork, also juicy, cooked well, but not my favorite sauce I've ever had. Green beans were yummy, but didn't really get why they were supposed to be \"firecracker green\" beans, not that spicy. Lastly the cornbread. OH THE CORNBREAD. Easily the best cornbread I have ever had, anywhere. Buttery, moist, just a little sweet. Amazing. It's worth a visit for the cornbread alone but I don't think you'll be disappointed by anything you order."}
{"text":"I've been here about 5x. My husband really likes the food here. I'm not big on bbq, but I can tell you that the corn muffins are amazing!! Also, I do like that they give you bbq an chips to snack on while you wait for your food. Gives you an opportunity to try their sauces. My husband aleays orders the pulled pork sandwich and he loves it."}
{"text":"Smells good and tastes good. Please note on weekends, dinner prices all day ( not listed on menu) Also did not notice flavored teas having a 99 cent refill despite already priced at $3.79. A little steep considering Longhorn are similarly priced and prepared with free refills. Hostess service was good and table service very good. Vail is really personable and knowledgeable of the menu. Most of the crew looked happy to be working, so that is positive. 
 Restrooms were well-appointed. Will return the work week and take advantage of lunch specials. Could see this place being really busy with warmer weather and Carowinds crowds."}
{"text":"It is hard to say enough good things about this place. We had the burnt ends appetizer, and I had the combo plate of pulled pork and beef brisket. We split banana pudding for dessert which is scratch made in house!  Fabulous food!!!

As wonderful as the food was (and it was over the top), the best thing is the attitude of the staff.  This is a happy place. Service is stellar and done with genuine smiles. We were sitting in a spot where I could see into the kitchen, and they were smiling, helping each other, and seemed truly happy to be working together.

If Famous Dave's isn't legendary yet (they just opened a few weeks ago), they will be...and should be!  Go out of your way to eat here, it's worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food what else can I say about this place... Great BBQ!! If u want some awesome food I highly recommend this place and the staff members are excellent.."}
{"text":"Decent brisket - doubt I would order again
Good service - nice folks
Beer is expensive"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Famous Dave's Restaurants all over the country.  Always very pleased with service, wait time and the very good beef brisket.  My wife and I went to their new location tonight and left very disappointed.  Our food  came out 20 minutes after our friends.  The waiter offered me some complimentary muffins while we waited which we refused.  We came to eat BBQ with our friends.  Finally, they delivered some beef scraps on a bun.  ( I wish I would have taken a pic). I complained to our waiter we were expecting sliced brisket which he said that is what they normally serve.  He had no idea why our's looked so bad.  He didn't offer to have the sandwiches remade and we were tired of waiting.  

I strongly encourage the new franchise owner to get their act together.  I would have happily paid $10.95 for a very good sliced brisket sandwich,  not what we received."}
{"text":"The service is great. Staff is very friendly. The barbcue sandwich is not the south east barbcue and will never compare.  It is not good."}
{"text":"okay the manager needs some skills, she made it known that she was in jail before to another employee, she was loud, the items we wanted were out at the time, food cold by the time we took it home which means they had it sitting around I will not order or go there again I will look for other places for BBQ nothing to write home"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to lunch at Famous Dave's last week. We have always enjoyed the food and location. This time not so much. We were seated immediately as it was slow. The menus were stained with bbq sauce.We both had salads which were good. The server Jordan O was nice not overly friendly. Server made no suggestions nor did she do any upselling. She did answer our questions if we ask anything about the food. The restaurant was extremely slow at this time which was right at the noon hour. The server wasn't very attentive. We ask for bread pudding at the end as she never mentioned dessert which seemed surprising since their bread pudding is one of their signature items. It was delicious. Jordan did mention that we lucked out because that was the last piece. 
We would recommend the food to our friends."}
{"text":"Went for Memorial Day lunch. Tiana was our server. She was kind and knowledgeable. The cornbread muffins are great. We both had the beer battered cod and the beef brisket combo with salad. The salads were great. The brisket was dry and flavorless.  The cod was hot and bland. Nice meal overall. They have several great BBQ sauces. We like the mustard vinegar Georgia sauce"}
{"text":"Food was great. Very flavorful and great sauces to compliment. Extremely hard to get through when trying to place an Togo order. We ordered the sampler platter and bbq nachos with NO BEANS to share between my boyfriend and I.  There was MORE than enough food. On the sampler platter we wanted bone in wings but got boneless. Had to call the store numerous times to get through but they called me back and we went back to the restaurant to trade for the bone in. We finally got home and once we started eating we noticed that our nachos were LOADED with beans ."}
{"text":"As always.. excellent bbq and we had the best service when we went in.. we had a family of 6 and she was very attentive and took care of the kids first which we always appreciate..

We will be back and be back often"}
{"text":"I am from Texas and after 42 years of amazing BBQ we moved to North Carolina. I have struggled to find a close second to Texas BBQ and nothin has  even been in the same ball park. Famous Dave's is now my favorite BBQ place. I'm sad I live so far North in North Carolina. Y'all need to open a location up there. Great food. Great portion for the money. AMAZING TASTE!"}
{"text":"Star deducted for the missing shack fries 1st visit. 
Salty and overly salted onion straws on the 2nd visit. 
Dear Lord, that baby fry cook must've thought he was making this for himself.

I was going to give 4 stars when I started this review a few weeks ago. 
As of tonight, it'll be 3 stars and I'm submitting an application for employment. I cannot let Famous Dave's go under here. Ewww. I can't. Why? I'll have the trifecta if I can get a Pizza Extreme here for Chicago Deep Dish... then I\"ll have all my Midwest places + Some kind of Southern living (e.g. Culver's, Famoud Dave's, Chicago Pizza, Sonic's for a slush, blah blah blah). 

Well, wish me luck. I thought about just picking up tables but now I think I need to submit for management. They legit never answer that phone and I blew it off the first runs since I called at opening but middle of the day during the evening and I'm still getting voicemails... Le Sigh~

P.S. Catch Lunch and try everything. I recommend most everything except these new fries, that mac & cheese I refuse to even try since it has corn and always always pick up an ALL AMERICAN FEAST to accommodate all."}
{"text":"We went here as an office for a work lunch and I doubt I will go back on my own dime. 

The facility is completely new and squeaky clean and the food came out quickly. I opted for the two meat lunch combo - brisket and wings with a side of mac and cheese. The brisket was a little dry but the boneless wings weren't bad. Nothing special, but not bad. The mac and cheese was disappointing even before I bit into a large piece of plastic wrap. That definitely put me off the rest of the meal.

There are too many fabulous BBQ options within a couple miles to eat a meal that's mediocre."}
{"text":"Just ordered $42. Worth of bbq and sides with extra sauce and they gave me to go sauce packets. Had to go back in 110* heat to get extra sauce. So not happy.."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The staff are top notch some of the best in town tbh!!! I always come in and order the ribs, tips or catfish finger and i have never been failed yet!! Cornbread muffins are delicious sweet and freshly baked (you can tell)!! If you're looking for an amazing BBQ joint, Great warm service and a good drink...Famous Dave's is where to Go..."}
{"text":"I grew up in Minnesota so when Dave's opened I was excited!  Of course there is plenty of BBQ in the area, but nothing like the stuff at Dave's.  The sauce and food is just like I remembered back home.  The decor is homey and open.  I did hear uncensored music playing.

My only complaint is that the soup was a bit on the salty side.  It was almost inedible, but I was able to wash it down with a lot of water.  I don't like the new fries.  They are not seasoned enough.  The chicken tenders are flavored well with Dave's seasoning.  The catfish fingers are moist on the inside and have a delicate flavor.  The tartar like sauce offers a nice spice to the fish.

The cornbread muffins are amazing.  In fact, they are cat-worthy.  My cat is a jerk because she decided to eat it when I left it on the kitchen counter overnight.

I heard a microwave in use during my visit, can you guys at least hide it from public view?"}
{"text":"The food was great. I enjoyed a beef brisket sandwich with the spicy bbq sauce       The Mac n cheese was good also. My wife had chicken sandwich and she enjoyed that as well. The only reason for 4 stars was because the hostess at the front counter had a horrible attitude.  She obviously forgot to pull the stick out of her butt before coming to work today. LOL, seriously she was bad."}
{"text":"I was there a couple weeks back in the afternoon time slot with My Fiance.The food and service was tolerable as we sat next to an exit door.The place was freezing cold.Our food was cold in minutes,I had a jacket on and that wasn't keeping me comfortable whatsoever,We asked about turning up the heat/or down with the cold but we were told they cant do either.I wound up outside while my fiance took care of everything and we left early.I had only gotten to 2 ribs and everything was cold after that,SO WE PACKED IT IN AND TOOK OUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE. So much for Infamous Daves"}
{"text":"The manager Andy was very welcoming and our waitress KRISTEN ROCKS. I have had my dinner at many establishments around this world but the service and food we had this evening was exquisite. Thank you Kristen for ensuring our meal was enjoyable. We will be back to see you all again.  Tonia & family"}
{"text":"TWO WORDS. \"MISS VAL!!!\" She made my first visit the best experience I've had while dining. She's charismatic, fun and makes you have a good day. She went thru the entire menu and gave recommendations without being pushy. The food is fantastic! I recommend everything."}
{"text":"The food is food, the staff was friendly polite, and so far I haven't seen evidence of food poisoning which is why they got the second star.  Beyond that, I wouldn't recommend this place. 
Order the \"burnt ends\" and what we got was a piece of brisket that they cut up into tiny squares. And none of it was burnt (got 2 pieces where I could taste one corner that was smoked). 
I ordered the lunch double cheese burger and fries. What I got was 7 fries and a double Bubba burger. I think they just go to Costco to pick up a bag of frozen burgers. And why they couldn't give a decent portion of fries is bewildering. 
My friend got the double meat bbq plate and said the beans tasted like cheap canned beans with relish in it. And the cornbread was so dry it fell apart. 
Basically, if you like good service and bad food, this is the place for you. If crappy food doesn't interest you, go just about anywhere else."}
