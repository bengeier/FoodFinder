{"text":"Great lo mein, egg rolls are great."}
{"text":"New Asian Cuisine is a hidden treasure!  I was warmly greeted by the owner with a smile.  I could tell he truly appreciated my business which is a breath of fresh air from other restaurants in town who think they are doing me a favor by eating at their restaurant. The food was fresh and delicious and the egg roll was fresh too!  At most Asian restaurants, the egg rolls are frozen, but I could see the fresh cabbage when I bit into the egg roll at New Asian Cuisine.  I will definitely be back and if you are craving Asian food - this is the only place to go!"}
{"text":"My husband and I, love this restaurant. It's our favorite Chinese restaurant. We have brought so many of our friends to eat here and they love and keep going back."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was very good! We ordered shrimp fried rice, sesame shrimp, and vegetable lo mein. The Shrimp fried rice was my favorite. The flavors were great. We ordered right before they closed. When we picked up the food it was ready and the cashier was very friendly. What more could a girl ask!?!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Ive had better and had worse. Cant say i will be in a rush to go back here. Price was not bad"}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times, and have taken quite a few other people from time to time.  Everyone has liked it a lot. The hostesses and waitresses are very friendly and helpful in explaining different preparations and sauces.  Food has always been very good, large portions.  Eggrolls are crispy, pad thai very different from the usual.  Everything we have ever eaten here has been tasty and well prepared.  One of our favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"I'm giving this five stars based on the type of restaurant it is - it's not a super elegant, super expensive Chinese restaurant, but for the price the quality of food, the service, and the relaxed atmosphere (I like all the booths) it's definitely a winner. The wonton soup is the best I've ever had in my life, and the red Thai curry is to die for. Staff are very friendly and the lunch specials are a super deal. Would  probably go there every day if I could!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. The food was good! I had hibachi chicken and my mom had scallion chicken. Both dishes were a good price on their lunch menu. I will be coming back. Service was good and staff was friendly. Wonton soup good price and was very good."}
{"text":"There is one day a week they are not open so call first.  Other than that, they have decent food and its actually pretty good compared to all the Tings and ChinChins on Central or Albemarle road. So what I'm sayin is its worth the drive down Lawyers to get 'better' chinese food.   Oh... the two dishes I like there aren't even Chinese. Pad Thai or the Curry Chicken. I did get the typical general's chicken and the Sa cha and loved them both."}
{"text":"Try the \"Singapore Mee Hoon\" nice and spicy.  Their Pineapple Fried Rice is awesome and a great change from ordinary (Beef, Pork, etc.) fried rice.  If you are not sure you can order the \"House Special\" fried rice, It has a little bit of everything  Chicken , Beef , Pork, Shrimp...It is sooooo tasty.   The Orange Chicken left me speechless..It was dry and was nearly tastless.   The owners and staff are friendly and wonderful with thier dine in experience being quite nice. Take out food from here losses something during the packing and transportation. I definitely recommend sitting down and enjoying this wonderful restaurant.   The staff is attentive and patient and the prices are very fair"}
{"text":"We went there a few years ago & it was good. We went there recently & the food is BLAND. Like hospital Chinese food. I don't mean that it's not spicy ebough for my taste. I mean it is bland & flavorless. Price is at least a dollar more per entree than the chinese restaurant (Sizzlin Wok) that recently closed down just across the street. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff that will make anything you want.  All chicken dishes can be ordered as white meat only."}
{"text":"Not Impressed.  Take out last night.  Bland flavors, dishes were very dry (spare ribs and lomein) - not enough sauces on the noodles, curry was okay.   Zucchini is way over used- probably because it adds bulk and is cheap.  It's obvious though that Brighton Park rent is high because the same dishes from the place next to Food Lion cost) $15 less and we always have leftovers."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot. It's better than fast food Chinese, but not expensive. Their tofu is great, portions are good, ingredients are fresh and the veggies are crisp and well prepared. It's better in the restaurant than it is to go."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time.  Nice, clean, friendly little (mostly) Chinese restaurant in Mint Hill.  The food is consistent and I really like the staff to boot. Great place for when you're in the area with friends or family, don't want to cook, and want something good and inexpensive."}
{"text":"We used to frequent the restaurant. Recently, the food quality and flavors changed. Not sure if there is a new cook, management or something else. So sad about that!! Used to be such a great place to get delicious take out or dine in Chinese food."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this restaurant in a very long time and all I can say is I've been missing out. We went on Christmas Eve since it was one of the only places in town open it was packed we got seated and given our menus but it was at least 10 minutes till we got to order our drinks. Again it was very busy over all the service was really slow and the waitress seemed very stressed not that I blame her. I ordered wonton soup and chicken Lo Mein. Everyone at the table gets to snack on their in house made fried noodles and duck sauce and they are yummy, my Wonton Soup came out hot and very good. And then the Lo Mein came it looked so good everyone at the table was in awe over my plate and looks did not lie it was delicious! Chicken, bean sprouts, green onion, and snow peas. My dad got Cashew Chicken he said was very good  as well and my mom ordered from the Japanese Grill menu Teriyaki chicken with mixed vegetables it was pretty good but not as good as the other things we tried. They have a pretty good looking lunch specials menu as well we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always our go to when we want to eat out but can't decide where. We usually get the hibachi chicken and split it. The thing that makes this place great is the staff. They could not be any nicer. Even if it has been awhile since we have been in they still remember us."}
{"text":"I've dined here a handful of times and as of late, their food has become better. Most recently I went for lunch, ordering Pork Dumpling, General Tso with rice. Portions were decent and food was pretty good. For the price it was a-okay. Not the best Asian food but definitely far from the worst. I'll be back I'm sure."}
{"text":"I placed a pick up order at 4:30 to be picked up 6:30. I arrived at 6:00 the lady running the desk put my order in immediately. One of the males, possibly the manger came out and told me the order was being worked on and would be out shortly. It was a HUGE order. They sat me while I waited and asked if I wanted a drink. Definitely customer service focused. That they serve Thai, Hibachi and Chinese is a huge bonus.  The food was excellent and abundant. They have a life long customer!"}
{"text":"Phone in orders are always fast and accurate. Do yourself a favor....The Singapore noodles are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Charlotte. Employees are always nice, place is always clean, food is always fresh and prices are reasonable. You can tell a lot about a Chinese restaurant by its rice that's the main thing I notice and theirs is always on point fluffy moist rice with fresh veggies, try the special fried rice you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! From the moment they welcomed us at the door to when they presented us with our meal and then the check.   Service with a Capital S.  The food? Very good!!!  Shrimp eggroll, pan fried dumpling, moo shu pork, sesame chicken, house Merlot, spare ribs..  wow!!!!  Very GOOD food. Excellent SERVICE. Great take out and very fast with delivery. Whether to the table or your car.   I've been to all four local \"Chinese\" food places.  This? Extremely happy with their product, delivery, service, wine and bar list. All over, great job folks!  Thank you for your attention to SERVICE."}
{"text":"Since Dynasty closed down, we've had a hard time finding a really great place to eat. For the location and money, New Asian Cuisine has come the closest. I've really enjoyed the last three meals we've had here. The staff is great, the service was spot on the food was of the highest quality - fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"The only Chinese food I will eat. The staff knows me by face and my order,  their family owned and operated."}
{"text":"We've been eating here pretty regularly for the three years we've lived in Charlotte.  The ladies who work here are always friendly and accommodating.  Portions are of good size.  I always have leftovers for lunch the next day.  They are always closed on Tuesdays so remember that tidbit next time you want Chinese on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"Took a chance visiting this restaurant. Chinese food in Charlotte leaves allot to be desired.   Walking to my car after leaving out of Harris Teeter, I happen to glance over and read the huge sign. Not sure if this was a new place or not, but decided to check it out on Yelp first. Reviews seemed fair.  Walked over and ordered carryout.  Less than 10 minute wait. Drove back home, prayed for my food, and dug in. The shrimp fried rice was great. Not too salty. Shrimps are not microscopic size. Just really good. The orange chicken was meh. Chicken was chewy. The orange glaze was salty and tongue numbing. Not ordering that again.  However, the fried rice is good enough to convince me to return and try another side item. Next time I will try the beef broccoli.  I will keep Yelpers posted.  ----- Update: I am addicted to their fried rice. It really is good. Paired it with Pineapple Chicken. Very good. So I upped them a star. Plus we had such an enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for a few years now. The waitresses are always very friendly. One in particular always remembers the nuances of my orders. I love the ginger salad for lunch. I always order eggdrop soup. It's great with the crispy noodles. Like the atmosphere. They don't have a TV on every wall thank goodness. My chicken and vegetables are always spot on.  Only drawback is the restaurant could use some updating, especially the wallpaper.  It's getting dingy and starting to curl up at the edges. Otherwise, the food, price and service is perfect."}
{"text":"After discovering this gem, I have not gone to any other Chinese restaurant in the Charlotte area. Hands down, the best! The staff is warm and attentive. The food amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this little place.  I think they have the best egg rolls around!  I usually visit here for lunch when plate sizes are smaller but occasionally visit for dinner.  Rarely have we selected something we did not like.  Food is very mild here so even spicy dishes are not sweat induced.  Recently tried a new hibachi shrimp and noodle entree which was wonderful.  Service is very friendly and usually quick.  Prices are reasonable.  This place is always clean and welcoming."}
{"text":"I've only tried New Asian once so far, but I will be back. My wife and I got takeout and wanted to mix it up from our usual choice in the area. We ordered some soups, Pad Thai, and Kung Pao Chicken. Prices were good, servings were large, and it was ready for pickup in about 10 minutes. Overall, the food wasn't impressive, but it wasn't bad either. I would order everything again next time my Chinese food craving hits."}
{"text":"Two words... Simply delicious. It was a perfect helping for a wonderful hangover helper. The service was helpful and attentive. Would highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, years in fact, you will never go wrong here! The hospitality is the type you receive if you live out in the country. The food is fresh always hot and they pay attention to detail. I've ordered different items, all great and will continue to order new stuff."}
{"text":"I was picking up To-Go food at a place close but and suddenly craved Cheese Wontons and Chicken and broccoli. I'm from NY and can't find good Chinese food anywhere down here. This place was pretty decent. Good price and decent flavor."}
{"text":"Decent meal and selection. Small on the inside, but it is in a strip mall. But so far as far as quick and close it is the best thing in town."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Carry out at least once a week and it's always good!  Take out is fast and friendly and the portions are generous. I'm craving it right now as I'm typing this message. Think I will pick some up tomorrow night on my way home from work!"}
{"text":"In the (relatively) new Lowe's Foods shopping center, in the rapidly developing area near Highway 51 and Lawyers Road where they're buliding lots of new houses, this restaurant sure is postioned well.  Having been open about six months, we decided it was worth a visit.  The place is nice, as long as you don't look at the carpet.  Seeing as the whole center isn't that old, it's amazing to see carpet that looks about 10 years old.  No telling how that happened.  That said, the food is what we were after, not the carpet, and that didn't disappoint.  Quickly served tempura appetizer was good, although a bit heavy on the batter, and not as light as most tempura dishes.  Instead of having smallish veggies, it was chunky style, which was odd, although not entirely bad.  Lettuce wraps were good, though I'm not sure I really like tofu, and there was plenty of it in the mixed chicken that was served with the dish.  We also had some spring rolls, but let's face it - it's tough to mess up spring rolls (or deep fried rolled anything).  We will probably go back another time for a full-fledged meal, but for a sampling of appetizers it wasn't bad at all."}
{"text":"We love New Asian Cuisine.  It is one of our go to places to both dine in and to carry out. They have an extensive menu and everything we have tried has been well prepared.  The staff here are very friendly and work together well to serve customers efficiently without rushing you.  Prices are quite reasonable and the portions are large. We usually count on enjoying lunch the next day from our dinner."}
{"text":"I've been living in this area for 10 years now and this is my go to Chinese place. Whenever I feel like general tso's this is where I come to. Consistently good food and great service."}
{"text":"Have had dinner here a few times over the past few years. I've never been very impressed but now I'm done with this place. My wife recently called and ordered dinner for takeout. When she picked up our dinner she made the mistake of asking for hot sauce. At this point she was scolded by a short, older woman working the cash register. Apparently this should have been ordered in advance????  Really? Being condescending and embarrassing your customers? Well she missed out on a nice tip and this place has one less family wasting our money there. I do highly recommend China Express 2 which is about a mile away. I have never been disappointed there."}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly service! The chicken satay skewers were amazing, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Only took me over 4 years to find a good Chinese place in Charlotte.  The food was taste great made fresh and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Came on s Sunday around 1 pm. Service was good and efficient. Hot & sour soup and Wonton soups were tasty. The chicken and cashew with egg roll and fried rice was enough to split! It was very good and the chicken tender.  We have been here 3 times and had a consistent experience"}
{"text":"The best Service yes that is a capital S. The food is always great and large portions. I have only tried half of the menu so far and all is so good . This is the only place I go for asian food in the area I have tried so many others that  are so poor. I will give you a guarrreennteee if you do not like I will eat my hat."}
{"text":"I've had take out from here a few times for lunch. I've had the scallion chicken each time. Great flavor. I like the sweet heat. The egg roles are nice & crunchy. The service is quick (when you call in an order, it takes about 10 minutes for pick up) and the price is very affordable (about 7 bucks). If you're looking for a nice, quick and affordable lunch in the Mint Hill area, swing on by."}
{"text":"I came to New Asian Cuisine with my co-workers during lunch time. I had the General Tso's chicken with fried rice. My food was cooked well and was tasty. I also loved their lunch prices, as well. I recommend this spot if you're looking for some delicious Chinese food."}
{"text":"I haven't tried many dishes here but the ones I have are good.  I like the orange chicken and mango chicken.  The only thing I will say about the mango chicken is that it comes with too much sauce.  I'd advise asking them to not put quite so much in.  It is almost a bowl of soup, there's so much sauce."}
{"text":"Quite simply the best Chinese food we have ever had!  Fresh, fast, friendly!  This our first choice for dining out. But not on Tuesdays!   The mango chicken is excellent as is their Pad Thai. Now on a diet, we get the steamer plate with garlic sauce on the side!   We have eaten here for years and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Decided to try the place out after reading all the positive feedback... ordered sesame chicken with rice, orange chicken with rice and a chicken lo main .. all the dishes tasted the same and very bland .. the lo main was very overcooked .. the chicken was pretty good in all the dishes but just so bland ... I mean no flavors what's so ever .. why the big hype about this place, I don't know .."}
{"text":"Great Place! We've enjoyed their food and eat there regularly."}
{"text":"Not your typical hole in the wall Chinese food. More traditional type stuff. Love the family atmosphere amongst the staff."}
{"text":"(queue the crickets... )  It's been about four months since I got take out and still the crickets are in my head for a review.   I was really craving hot and sour soup and had been meaning to give them a try. The first time I went there I ask if they accept AMEX - which they don't and I didn't have cash on me so my visit would have to wait.   Finally a chance came about... I was sick at home and craved some soup. So I got the soup and was not excited by it nor disgusted by it. It was soooo thick and missing the kick that usually comes with it.   I asked for broth only -- can't stand meats in my soup, I don't care if they are made with a meat base, but I just hate meats in my soup. Again, it was so thick it kinda freaked my mouth out...   I've ordered it again, but really doubt I'll return. The tofu broccoli is okay, yet a bit greasy, but again, nothing that stands out...    All in all, I've had better... thanks though."}
{"text":"Food is always great. Best sesame chicken around, egg rolls are awesome also. Staff is very friendly as well"}
{"text":"Ok so this is my first Asian food experience since I moved from NY. I got lunch since I was right down the road and I said I know what people keep telling me, you can't get food asian or Italian here.   Well I got Pad Thai and it is not NY for sure but it was ok. The price is awesome, there was a lot of food along with the pad Thai I also hit an egg roll and a soda all for $8.   I would definitely try this place again and try regular Chinese food"}
{"text":"We tried this local restaurant after seeing the Yelp reviews, but it didn't live up to the 4-Star average. We had the House special fried rice, pad Thai and pineapple chicken. All were piping hot, even though we did take out, but the flavor just wasn't there. Everything was really bland. The chicken and pork were tender though so I'd Place it firmly at average Chinese take out."}
