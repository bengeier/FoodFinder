{"text":"Not my cup of tea. Although from many other reviews people seem to like this place. I'm not saying it's bad but I am very particular with my hot pots and like to have a garlic sauce similar to boiling points condiments. 
This place does serve good food and looks delicious but I am a sauce person and similar to my joy pot I like popcorn chicken with sweet and sour or spicy sauce. Something along the lines with a flavorful taste so I don't just taste the fried chicken breast. 
It may be due to the many Asian fusion places in my area. Living in SGV (San Gabriel Valley), which leaves me to make a drastic opinion based on things that others may not even care for. But overall presentation and quality is pretty good but I would not come back."}
{"text":"One of My favorite restaurant for dinner ...especially during colder weather ...owner Wendy and staff Kevin are always super!! Love this place !"}
{"text":"Server (Jessica ) was super energetic and nice! 

Had the half & half Taiwanese sausage as an appetizer for the table. Definitely liked the black pepper sausage more.  

We all had the Ribeye hot pot. We were hesitant to order medium spicy,  so we ordered mild with a side of chili oil/sauce to add if we wanted to go spicier. Be sure to get your side of rice with the minced pork! The hotpot itself had a generous amount of different ingredients besides the ribeye itself.  

Strawberry & mango shaved ice with sea salt caramel ice cream was delish! The ice cream was sooo good!"}
{"text":"Veggie pot was pretty bland. The miso broth was great in the other soups my companions had. Wish I'd ordered that! 
Popcorn chicken was pretty Yummy. Definitely check out their fresh juices!"}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to eating here ever since it opened. First of all let me say how did I not know of Taiwanese Hot Pot before, AMAZING! Me and my husband went to check it out just a few nights ago and we absolutely loved it! The popcorn chicken is absolutely amazing.  It is soft and tender on the inside and just the right crispiness on the outside, the flavor is awesome. I got the Rib Eye hot pot and my husband got the Miso hot pot and Holy Moly, we were impressed. There was so much food we couldn't finish it all. You can definitely share with 2 people (order an appetizer as well). Their teas are so yummy yumy, my favorite is the Passion Fruit Black Tea (you can get boba in them as well), Yumo!!! 

The ladies are so sweet and nice there. There was even a lady walking around with more hot broth, refreshing everyone's hot pot. I loved that the pots arrived to your table over fire  So Cool! 

I loved it so much, I ordered take out tonight and got a popcorn chicken rice platter which I'm looking forward to devouring. I definitely recommend this place and I'm looking forward to my next trip there."}
{"text":"My second hot pot restaurant.  The pots easily feed 2 or 1 reallllyyy hungry person.  We had 3 different pots (ribe eye beef, pork and clam and seafood) and popcorn chicken.  The list to choose from is a good selection.  It was a rainy weekend and the hot soup hit the spot.  Popcorn chicken is not a typical flavor.  Its crispy but not hard with a hint of mint.  Service is great!  Never hesitate to ask, they are more than happy to answer any questions you have.  If you havent tried it, you need to get there!!!"}
{"text":"I have had my shares of Taiwanese hot pot and popcorn chicken and Pot of Tea's food in general is made with fresh ingredients with no mosh. The broth is clear and tasty made from your perfected choice of hot pot ingredients.  The popcorn chicken batter is light filled with traditional Taiwanese flavors. Also, the teas are not heavily sweeten like most tea house too. The ambiance us nice and clean and attentive staff.  I am very satisfied with my overall experience. :)"}
{"text":"The mini hot pot concept is very cute. I ordered the Taiwanese hot pot (mild spicy level) and it arrived with nice presentation. I've never had this dish anywhere before but it is much lighter broth than I expected. Maybe I needed to order higher spicy level. Anyways, the portion was way too big for just me, so at $12 it became a pricey lunch for me.  It would be great for 2 people to share.  Next time I'll ask if it's possible to turn off the fire whenever we want, because the noodles became way too overcooked as I ate. The minced pork rice was good though. I'll probably come back to try the popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"I was craving for hot pot, so the family decided to check this place out after work. We ordered ribeye beef pot, lobster pot, mango black tea, Taiwanese popcorn chicken, fried chicken and mince rice ..We will definitely come again.. Love the food and service!  Too bad it's on the opposite side of town.."}
{"text":"If only I can give 10 star I would! So good!! I got the Rib Eye pot, Chicken Wings and Taiwanese popcorn Chicken plus Jasmine iced tea. Best hot pot in town! I would def. go back!!"}
{"text":"I just had the Korean Kimche Pot with a side of minced pork and white rice. It was very good and authentic, but it cost too much for lunch.  The mince pork was too salty. The serving was not much (serving for one).  Lunch specials maybe would attract more people. I was there during lunch time 12-1 pm and most of the tables were empty. I also ordered milk tea and it was good.  Cost about the same as other places. My bill totaled just over $22 (charged me an extra $2.50 for a small bowl of rice). I have never charged extra for white rice.  Customer service was friendly and somewhat attentive. However, overall really not worth the money."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for hot pot. I got the rib eye beef hot pot and the flavors were amazing. Their popcorn chicken tasted authentic too. And bro... their watermelon crush... out of this world.

Our server Howard helped us choose all these items. He was great too. Ask for Howard next time you go in!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time being here. We were greeted and seated immediately and our waitress was very nice and attentive. The atmosphere is well lighted and cozy. All the staff in general were friendly and courteous. We (3 of us) ordered the spicy Taiwanese hot pot and the rib eye hot pot and it was delicious! The waiter constantly came around and asked us if we want to refill our soup. We were stuffed afterwards. The reason why I took off a star was the price is bit expensive but other than that, would come here again!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the servers are very nice.  If it's your first time, they are patient and explain everything to you.  The popcorn chicken appetizer recommended by the server was super flavorful!"}
{"text":"I was craving for hot pot when coming here so I have to admit I had high expectations when walking into this place. I ordered the spicy Taiwanese hot pot and an order of Chicken wings.

The hotpot was lack of flavor the noodles that came inside the pot was so stale that it had a smell to it. That totally ruined the hotpot for me.  I tried to pick out the few pieces of meat and edible items in there since the pot came out to about $13 which is very pricy for having nothing in it but noodles and bland soup base. 

On to the next.... The chicken wings were completely not marinated at all. They brought it out with a dipping sauce expecting the sauce to make the flavor.  No... That's not how wings are supposed to be made.  I wouldn't have graded this place with only 3 stars if the price was reasonable. I had the mini hotpot wIth an order of Chicken wings and a cup of tea which made my total bill almost $40 bucks. At that price I would have been better off going to a buffet with many more options."}
{"text":"Japanese miso soup was sooooo goooooood but I don't like the stinky tofu soup. But anything else was good. Server was very nice. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Omg!! I love this place so much. Everything is so goooooood. I always ordered Japanese miso soup :) I will always go back to this place. I love their food and their servers are really nice. I love Maya and Sae :) they are so awesome :) so if you never come to this place.. Please stop by and try the best soup ever :)"}
{"text":"Like many other Yelpers, Pot Tea is compared to the Boiling Point in LA.  Not a bad thing to be compared to, if truth be told.   Both are very good, but different from each other.

Set in a nice location with very friendly people, they do a good business, and have obvious repeat customers, including myself.

All of the pots have a lot of food in them, they are full.  A lot of extras in there, they are not cheap about it at all.   Not especially spicy overall, but tasty, and they'll give you a huge bowl of spicy sauce if you ask.

Popcorn chicken is awesome!

Quite unlike Boiling Point, you will actually want to stay here for a while after your food, it has that atmosphere here."}
{"text":"I've dined at Pot Tea a few times now but probably won't be returning for a while. I had never had Taiwanese hot pot before dining here, so I can't tell you how it compares to others, but I found the food to be pretty good. I ordered the spicy beef pot on every visit and I think the broth is pretty tasty.

My problem with this place isn't the food - it's the service. The staff is very friendly but not attentive at all. I've been here when customer traffic has been at varying levels, and each time their attentiveness has been consistently low. On every occasion, once I received my food, not one server checked in to see if we needed anything else, refills, etc. Furthermore, the service is very slow. It's taken them an abnormally long time to serve us our good every time we've been here. 

Pot tea is still fairly new, so maybe they need more time to get their footing, but until then, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I love soup so I come here like once a week.  Service is great, food is tasty.   It's great if you love trying something new and healthy.."}
{"text":"This was the first time I got hot pot in an individual bowl. I thought that was pretty neat. I appreciate that there was an assortment of ingredients they give you. The broth was not flavorful and there was not that much meat. I did appreciate the server who kept  asking us how we were doing.
Pros: service 
Cons: flavor"}
{"text":"Always come to this place when I'm near the area. Lobster pot and the minced pork rice were a delight. Oh, and the passion fruit tea's the most refreshing drink ever!!!! Too bad they don't have a branch near Henderson."}
{"text":"I REALLY REALLY wanted to give this place more stars!!! If it was based on service alone, hands down 5/5 stars. It's the food that brings it down. Service wise, they are probably one of the friendliest Asian places ever. They were polite and always checked up on us seeing if we wanted more fire, more broth, more water. They were amazing. They gave us a complimentary appetizer. It was the fried chicken, the same kinda fried chicken you would get at a boba place. Personally, at $6 I would've never ordered the chicken, it's just nothing special. Now their hot pots..... When you snap a pic of the food, it looks AMAZING. It's very colorful, it looks good. But there was almost no taste in the broth!!! It was verryyyyyyyy bland. I tried to play around with the sauces they had on the table, and I just created some other alien cuisine. It was such a disappointment. I really wanted to give this place more stars, but the food is just not up to par."}
{"text":"This place is great when you want to have a steamy hot pot all to yourself. You can taylor the amount of spice you want. The staff is always attentive and friendly. The popcorn chicken and pork chop rice is good. My kids always want more of the minced meat rice.I like that you can add additional items on the side for your hot pot, I personally like extra steak. Always satisfying on a cold winter night. Wish the location was more central, near Chinatown."}
{"text":"I have been eager to try this place out, so I guess after having to wait for some time, my expectations were a little high. I ordered the mango black tea as suggested. The tea tasted fresh, but it was overly sweet. I did like the different hot pot choices and settled on the rib eye, spicy. The presentation of the pot was beautiful. The colors of the veggies in the pot was eye catching and made my mouth water, but it stopped there. Besides being eye catching and the ingredients being decently fresh, there was nothing delicious about this hot pot. To me, the broth makes the dish because, after all, the ingredients are cooked in this flavor. The broth was too bland and with the added spiciness, all I tasted was spicy water. The only redeeming quality about this place was the service. Both waitresses were attentive, helpful, and nice. Not sure if I would give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Love it. Love it here. This is my favorite place to eat. If I could, I would eat here everyday. Their hot pots are delicious. The service is so welcomed. Our family love to chill here during dinner time. You got to try them out especially in winter time. So yummy to my tummy. Lol."}
{"text":"Redemption, redemption, redemption! 

I went to several personal hotpot places in the valley and finally came to a conclusion that pot tea makes the best hotpot in town. 

I haven't been here for 13 months. Last time I wasn't so happy about their rice and how they were mopping the place while I was working on my food. But I decided to give it another try after being absent from pot tea for quite some time. 

For this experience, the meat rice was delicious! I guess they heard my displeasure from my last review. It's funny how that since my food was good this time that everything else didn't matter anymore. A bowl of rice makes a world of a difference! 

I also brought my mom and my sister and OMG, they finished their pots before I did. My mom was really satisfied. My husband was super happy since he scored points with his MIL by taking her to pot tea too. 

Though my experience this time wasn't exactly the best, but I'm happy because the food was great and we left with full bellies and happy smiles. I'm giving pot tea four stars because they earned it. I didn't smell anything funky like what other reviewers described. They must have fixed their problem. We will be back for more pot tea in the near future."}
{"text":"I thought the prices were a little high for the quality. They could have had a few more rice dishes. I ordered stinky toufu, popcorn chicken and pork chop and rice. 
They were all ok. The flavored drinks were not fresh and made with powder. The staff was really friendly and the restaurant had plenty space inside. Would go back to try the hotpot. Good location in SW since I'm to lazy to drive to China town."}
{"text":"Service was good... The food taste terrible, feels like the boiling pot in LA, but taste totally different. I ordered the spicy pot, the super spicy one, it's not spicy at all...disoppionted"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on this place, we were really looking forward to trying it out and having hot soup on a windy day. Unfortunately, we ended up being disappointed and leaving hungry. 

There were maybe around 3 or 4 other parties when we got there so we didn't expect to wait long. We ordered chicken wings and the Japanese Miso hot pot. It took at least 30 minutes for the order to come out and only after following up with one of the servers who later turned out to be the manager. All the wait staff were very nice and did apologize for the delay. The food came out shortly after and the chicken wings were okay but we were so hungry by then anything would have tasted good. The hotpot came out after and the serving looked good for the price. 

Our dining experience made a turn for the worse when I found a piece of wire in our soup and I brought it to Ariana, the server's attention. She apologized and told us that she would be right back. After waiting another 10-15 minutes, she came back and said the manager will take care of us but didn't really elaborate. At that point, we had waited almost an hour and only had chicken wings. Another server asked us if we were okay and we told her that another server was helping us. We waited another 10 minutes and finally followed up with Ariana again who then told us that the person who came over was actually the manager Kara and she would take care of our bill. I told her that we didn't even know that she was the manager since she didn't introduce herself, just thought she was another server.

I understand that the place is new and maybe they are not used to handling this type of situation. I appreciate that they took care of the bill but we hardly ate and left still feeling hungry. They could have offered to replace our order although I'm not sure how much longer we would have been willing to wait. Sad to say we won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great and yummy food!  Warm and service!  Comfy and chic atmosphere!  Love that there's no or very little msg in their hot pot and food in general!   Felt healthy and great after eating here!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a few friends. We ordered a few differnt hot pots to share. We got the spicy seafood, a combination and also the lobster pot. The service was poor. There was plenty of girls working but all busy doing things other than attentive to customers. We had to waive them down for everything. Even with that, we didn't get service. They would knod their head then walk away. We ended up asking for the same thing 3 times before we got it. 

Once the food was delivered, we tried all 3 differnt pots. The broth all taste the same other than the spicy seafood being more spicy than the other pots. The broth was pretty bland. There wasn't that much meat/ seafood in any of the pots. It was mostly cabbage and veggies. Overall, it was pricy for cooked veggie soup."}
{"text":"Took my lady friend here and was blown away with how good the food tasted. Ingredients for our hot pot dishes were fresh and portions were huge.  We got the chicken wings and stinky tofu for our appetizers...so authentic. Service staff were nice and friendly. Definitely coming back for 1 more stop before leaving town."}
{"text":"Hot pot is pretty good but not much meat in it. For the new price of $13.99 it is just not worth it. =("}
{"text":"Came here to eat some good hot pot and I wasn't disappointed. The restaurant is well organized and the tables evenly spaced out.

I ordered the Taiwanese Spicy Pot and the staff was very accommodating, making sure the dish wasn't too spicy. The hot pots are individual so you and your partner will have your own personal pot. The pot comes in really hot so be careful of the fire. The food itself was really good. The tofu's firmness is just right, and the vegetables are crisp and juicy. The meat was mildly dry but acceptable. The soup is really flavorful so be careful not to drink too much of it!

The restaurant is clean and the wait staff was very attentive and helpful even when the restaurant got busy.

This restaurant was a bit of a drive, but definitely worth the trip. Definitely come check it out!"}
{"text":"Must try the Minced Pork Rice. The best I've had so far. Customer service is always good, always welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"Food : Great. All the pots never disappoint. Tried the pork chop rice and it was pretty good as well, don't forget to ask for minced pork on the rice!

Customer Service : Excellent, the waitress Nicole served me last year and also this year and she maintained a super positive attitude from start to end. This staff is an asset to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Yum. Hits the spot when I wanted some hot soup that is not pho, which I'm sick of eating. I always order extra meat on the side and their minced pork rice is delicious. I also tried their wings. Good n crispy. Make sure u try for yourself."}
{"text":"The concept of a hot pot of food always entices me. However, the food at Pot Tea was below average. The number one problem is that the food was so bland and tasted as if it were cooking in hot water. I don't believe they added any broth. I needed salt desperately and when I asked the waiter, he seemed puzzled by my request. He brought it out on a small plate. I guess they don't have salt and pepper shakers. With food that tastes like that, you need them. I got the rib eye pot. There were just a few bunches of thinly sliced rib eye, which were overcooked. I asked them to immediately turn off the flame because I knew this would be the case when they brought out the pot boiling. Pot Tea, on the other hand, had good service. The waitress was very friendly and happily explained how everything worked. The restaurant was also clean and airy. I like that."}
{"text":"Pros; clean, quality-appearing food. Great selections. My husband is vegetarian/pescatarian so they were able to used veggie broth in his hot pot. With every pot you can get a green or black tea for free; either sweetened or not. Good service, they always checked back on us to make sure we were okay. There were maybe 2-3 other tables seated. I ordered a kimchee bowl. It had just the right amount of kick for me and I enjoyed my meal after adding soysauce and squeezed lemons.

Cons: not much flavor to the broth; my husband had veggie broth so I'm not surprised. While I had beef broth and still kinda bland. I can taste the fat of the meat so I added soysauce and lemons. It was a little bit of work to eat- opening mussels while really hot/ shrimp.

I had it for a late lunch and wasn't too impressed but come dinner time I was really craving it again, lol!"}
{"text":"I love hot pot and this is the best one I have so far in CA and NV area. My family and I  feel this place is better than \"boiling pot\" in CA. the staff and the owners are great, surely will go back as a regular."}
{"text":"Upon arrival we felt very welcome with the friendly service. It being our first time, Jennifer our waiter was really informative. We tried the Japanese Miso Soup and the Rib Eye hot pot. Both dishes were delicious and  we had our spices on the side. I deducted a star because the chicken wings were slightly burnt on the outside and some pieces were rare and pink inside. However they took the wings off the check and overall we were satisfied. 4 stars... Good customer service!"}
{"text":"***Highlights***: Chicken Wings are on point. I could eat the pork rice all day.

Negatives: Its tough to say. There really is really no negatives that I have to write about this place. It just was just not my cup of tea. It is more of a personal preference sort of thing.

Price/Food: The food is what really makes of breaks a restaurant for me. If the food is not that great, then the rest of it doesn't really matter much to me. The variety in a single meal was awesome. But my hot pot was bland to me, it really lacked flavor. Although I loved their chicken wings, and I loved their teas. Its one of those places you just need to try and experience for yourself. The person I was eating with, genuinely enjoyed it. But again, just not my cup of tea. If you are into quail eggs or tripe, this is the place for you.

Service/Ambiance: Service was great. Very clean. Quiet and casual. Probably not for the kiddies, because of the open flame used to keep the hot pot boiling hot, but great for a weekday meal. Parking and location is really convenient. Easy to spot location."}
{"text":"Oh nom nom nom. Great hot pot for windy and chilly days. How can it get any better than personal hot pot served over a flame, with some solid Taiwanese appetizers? So far, I've tried the ribeye, clam and pork, and miso. The miso is by far the most flavorful, but I really do like the clam and pork as it's savory and gingery. Decent-sized portions. Taiwanese popcorn chicken and stinky tofu is great. The sauce for the stinky tofu kicks butt.

They have bubble tea and black/green teas. Service was really nice and friendly as well as warm. The restaurant itself is clean, bright, and modern. It has been pretty quiet both times we were there and I hope they get more foot traffic. It really is a nice place to bring family and friends."}
{"text":"We had the Seafood Pot & Prime Rib Pot. Also the popcorn chicken.  Food was OK. Staff very nice.. No alcohol yet. If we ever come back, it will be for the Taiwanese popcorn chicken. We will more than liking go to our favorite PHO restaurant and skip the HOT POTS. I approve this message J K KUHL..."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here! Despite it being a hot day, I was craving some hot pot. I got the Kimchi flavored hot pot with rice and minced pork. The broth and minced pork were delicious and flavorful. It also came with a lot of things: muscles, clams, pork meat, kimchi, tofu, shrimp, and more. Our server was incredibly patient and kind. She made sure to consistently check that we had enough soup broth and water. She was also bubbly and friendly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was definitely a cute place!  And I love the concept they have.  The menu is very simple to understand, it is clear and concise, which is awesome!  And once you ordered, each hot pot comes in an individual size per your order.  The food is delicious and the soup broth is yummy!  They also offer you spice level for your hot pot broth.  The mild is nicely seasoned and just the right amount of spice.

As for appetizer, they have stinky tofu!!!!  And it taste just like the ones I grew up eating...SCORE!  Now the beverage order is a bit different, if you order ice tea it comes in a to-go cup, sealed plastic cover, like you would with a boba drink.  

Overall we had a pleasant experience and probably go back."}
{"text":"Not sure if i'm a big fan of this place.  The price/service is just right and when you can get a full lobster boil for less than $20, that's a steal; however, I can't justify giving them 5 stars for just their price and service, therefore the 4 stars.  The food was average only because I came in comparing it to Boiling Point. 

I truly believe if I never had Boiling Point before and came here as if it was my first or second Taiwanese hot pot experience, I would love it! I still recommend you come and try it out though. 

The lobster was more for the gram than to eat.  It was a giant lobster that was hard to break apart and devour."}
{"text":"Me and my friend went to Pot tea social house around 7pm. The place was not that big it wasn't so busy to enjoy the meal during dinner time. Our server, his name was Yu, was very nice and patients. The food came really quick so that's a huge PLUS! 

We ordered Jasmine green tea and Rib eye beef pot. I don't like too spicy food, so we ordered just mild soup with minced pork bowl.

The food was really great for us. They had good portion and the flavor was fine. All in all, we will come back again to try their other hot pots. :)"}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  One of my favorite places in Las Vegas.  It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Great service and pretty good Hotpot. Just wish they would carry more different varieties on their menu. But everything is great."}
{"text":"Come one come all as every one is invited to the pot tea! .. (party) *badumtssss!* This place is perfect for bigger parties even though it was just my girlfriend and I. We had the entire place to ourselves and mid way through our meal at least 3 different parties came in. Very comfortable and home style seating with kpop blasting in the background which is the norms nowadays. 

The girlfriend ordered Ribeye Hot Pot with the mince pork rice (first picture) & I got the Veggie Pot Delight!!(second picture) 

So the name of the place is \"Pot Tea Social House\" which now I totally understand now because 1.. the food is damn pot is hot! And 2.. You are suppose to socialize and let the food cool down!! Pretty legitimate way to dine!! 

For me the food was okay I give it a 7/10 only because I feel like they didn't have enough condiments / spices to go with the dish. I noticed my girlfriend dipping her food into the chili and lemon ponzu and I just imitated being my first time. It still tasted a little off to me and kind of blandish. When I finally realized it I just threw all the chili and lemon ponzu all up in the soupy soups and that was the game changer for me!!

Tips are.. You can always get extra broth and they can turn the flame off or on to your request!

Overall I wouldn't mind going again. Tempted in trying the appetizers and enjoying the food more compared to burning my tongue!! Peep game on a good hot pot and socialize!! Peace!!"}
{"text":"This was the first hot pot place I had ever tried and after this place I was scared to try hot pot again. My friend and I ordered the popcorn chicken, sweet potato fries, and the Rib Eye Beef pot. 

The popcorn chicken was alright, but I honestly could have gone to a boba shop and got better popcorn chicken. The sweet potato fries were also alright. The Rib Eye Beef pot was not that good at all. There were only 3 ridiculously small pieces of beef, most of the pot was filled with vegetables. The broth was okay, but the entire pot was definitely not worth $19.99. 

The service was good up until our check. We waited for about 20 minutes to half an hour after we were clearly done eating to receive our check. We tried to call a waiter to receive the check earlier, but no one was to be found.

If you want quality hot pot, I do not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"This is not your typical hot pot restaurant.  I am a pretty picky eater, so I like hot pot because I can specifically choose what I would like to add to my pot.  I was aware that this restaurant served pre-assembled hot pots, but I decided to try it anyway.

This hot pot just was not enjoyable.  I believe I had the Rib Eye Beef Pot, but the broth lacked flavor and had way too many vegetables for my personal taste.  I am used to having some sort of sauce on the side to enhance the flavor of the dish, but that wasn't the case here.  We ordered the popcorn chicken, which was actually really addicting; I am so glad we ordered that!

On our way out, I had the Lychee Green Tea with boba and that was delicious!

The service was really good and everyone was extremely friendly.  However, it literally just was not flavorful enough to warrant a return trip.  It was also pretty pricy considering there was nothing really special in the hot pot.  I would not recommend to anyone who is looking for a legitimate hot pot restaurant."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday, restaurant was empty so we received prompt service. We had never had hot pot before so we did asked questions about what was in it and without an issue the waiter was so nice and went over the menu with us. We ended up having two of the seafood & tofu hot pot, along with the rice and noodles. We also grabbed some of the popcorn chicken. The hot pot itself was delicious and filled with seafood, full of flavor. The popcorn chicken, it was meh...nothing exciting but the rice with minced pork was outstanding. I also loved they had a variety of teas and fruit juices. I definitely enjoyed the fresh watermelon crush, very refreshing and not overly sweet. The passion green tea was definitely my favorite tho, it was just perfect. We really enjoyed the restaurant only reason I won't give it a 5 star is because we encountered two roaches. They were by the entrance so I'm going to assume they came from the outside but we will never know."}
{"text":"I have been to many hot pot places, and I am Taiwanese, I would say this place is actually the best you can get in Vegas other than Noodle Exchange at the Gold Coast got great hot pots as well.  
But I love it it's off the strip and clean, servers are super friendly.  It tastes pretty good and love the spicy bean paste they got on the table. 
I will come back here again, based on Vegas, this is real good for Asian food."}
{"text":"Pot Tea Social House is a Taiwanese hot pot place just 5 mins from where I work. It has opened for one year and I didn't even know it existed. I am a big fan of hot soups and noodles.

The service was amazing. Free refill of hot pot broth and oh, the jasmine tea was so fragrant. Of course, I thought you can't get that kind of service from just any waitress, she must be the owner. It turned out that Wendy was the owner and I chatted up with her about her food. No MSG and always real fruit syrup in the boba tea (not the powder kind). 

I ordered Seafood and Tofu Hot Pot (mild spicy level). The flavor of the soup needed no adjustment and the veggies tasted fresh. There was half crab in the soup. I had no problem picking it up with my fingers and ate it the messy way- the way it suppose to be. Free refill of broth and the fire was adjustable. Choices of sides (steamed rice, rice with minced pork, vermicelli).

Taiwanese sausage was yummy too. Don't forget to order the durian ice cream! Definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"Pot tea is a go to spot for my girlfriend and I when we can't decide where to eat. We can always count on the food being good and service being great!"}
{"text":"Alright this place is good, but its not THAT good. I honestly think this place got high ratings because this is the best hot pot we have in Vegas.. which isn't saying much. So overall taste wise, Pot Tea gets a solid 3 stars which is a little harsh, but since I am Chinese, I do have high expectations for hot pot.  

Came a couple of days after their opening and they were still doing some minor construction work. No biggie. I got the spicy beef hot pot and friend got the spicy miso pot. I asked for super super extra spicy while the friend got the mild. My hot pot turned out to not be spicy at all.. while my friend's actually had a good kick to it. The hot pot came with a side of minced pork rice (or vermicelli or white rice). I loved how they filled the pot with lots of ingredients, beef, fish cake, corn, imitation crab etc so they definitely weren't lacking in ingredients. What they were lacking in was flavor of the broth. The broth was really really light.. barely any flavor. And sure you can dip the stuff in the sauces they provided you with on the side, but they only provided you with 2. No option for you to make your own so that's kind of a bummer. We also ordered a side of popcorn chicken which wasn't that good either.. I thought the popcorn chicken at Easy Life was better. 

So overall, if you're not familiar with Chinese hot pot, then give this place a try. If you've grown up eating hot pot all your life, best to save the $12 and eat hot pot at home."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a year now and the food is absolutely delicious! If you're a fan of stinky tofu - look no further! The sauce they use is the better than Champion Deli. The hot pot is $14 and you get unlimited soup! We always LOVE ordering the pickled mustard green lamb hot pot with extra meat. The hotpot is designed for each person to order their own. But with appetizers and extra meat - 1 hotpot is enough for my mom and I. When you order the hot pot you have a choice between mince pork rice, steamed rice, or vermicelli. The minced pork rice is amazing if you like the taste of peanut. I personally do not like nuts - so I always opt for the noodles instead. 
They also have boba drinks here. My favorite is the winter melon milk tea. I always order less milk and less sugar. 
Also, if Mandy is there ... be sure to ask for her. She is an absolute sweetheart. She is attentive and constantly refilling our soup."}
{"text":"If you ever got a stamp card with them, make sure each stamp was signed and dated. Cuz they wouldn't give credit to the existing ones even tho it's not the customer's fault to know their stamp card 'policy' ... 
Well, I just wanna day it doesn't matter to me if they do not have any rewards program but since they do then they should've enforce it in a right way other than giving me the attitude that I've got 4 stamps but the server argued saying two of them were not signed and dated so they assumed these were accidentally stamped previously... they ended up signed and dated and gave me back the card still with 4 stamps... Am I supposed to know what's a real stamp's standard like??? I'm just a customer and not your employee...
Totally speechless. At the end I didn't even bother to get the card back and just left. Very disappointed and will never go back again."}
{"text":"We first visited Pot Tea on its soft opening and Wendy was very welcoming. She was even willing to give us a drink on the house. Good service is hard to find especially in Asian restaurants and Wendy left a great first impression. The second time we went in to eat for lunch. The staff was friendly and prompt when we needed anything. There was enough meat, seafood and veggies in my and my husbands pot. And the broth was just right. It reminded me of my mother in laws, which is delicious. Plus we got Jasmine green tea for free, since it was during lunch time. I have a bit of an addiction to tea and coffee lol, so I'm sure I'll be visiting more often just for the tea. Overall, I will be back with family because of the awesome service, great prices, and delicious food. It is worth checking out and eating at for sure!"}
{"text":"I came here with my wife in the early evening. The place is very nice and cute layout. The staff was very friendly and fast. The portions where big and great for sharing. My only complaint would be the chicken itself the seasoning was good but very fatty and chewy. And the shaved ice was a big to chunky but still tasted good. Overall its a nice place and the big bowls looked great."}
{"text":"Love the concept of this place but I have been here two times and the soups just DO NOT have any flavors, they always taste bland and for the price it's definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. 

Love the concept of the individual hot pots. Not sure about the reviews with people saying the soup was bland, it was actually perfect. Not too salty but beaming with flavor. I guess some people just like to eat their soup with a lot of salt.

Ordered the crispy chicken wings and popcorn chicken for our appetizer. It was actually pretty good and I would order it again in a heartbeat. They have two table sauces, their ponzu sauce and chili paste. I mixed them together and dipped my popcorn chicken in it, and it took it to a whole 'nother level lol. 
 Our table ordered a variety of hot pots from the famous rib-eye to the seafood pots. We all enjoyed it and kept repeating how much we loved it. Must I recommend the minced pork rice bowl. So simple but so good!!! 

And Wendy, she was AMAZING!!! Very attentive and always checked up on us. Also I couldn't finish my rib eye hot pot so I asked for a container, Wendy even asked if I wanted more soup :)

Looking forward to all the cold nights we will eat hot soup here!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a super cold night in Vegas. So soup it was! But I instantly regret coming here after waiting 10 minutes to be greeted another 10 minutes to get water. Highly disappointed with the lack of service and super small portions and high prices. It was a cold night so a lot of people tend to want soup. This place was not even that busy BUT they only had 2 people working and they seemed pretty young and inexperienced. I don't hold that against them (servers) because it was obvious that they didn't have the skills or experience to handle the front of the house. I truly do give them a pass. This review is about the OWNERS who let this happen. How could you run your business KNOWING it's been cold in Vegas and your restaurant is going to rely on TWO people, who obviously aren't skilled enough to run YOUR establishment?!? If it were my restaurant I would at least have come in and worked-- pride aside from being the owner. Or make sure that your restaurant is properly staffed!! Super RANT. But hey whatever. I won't be back again. The portions are small. The side of Tofu was $4?!? What?! So disappointed. Pictures of the soup look better than it was in person! Oh and the flame is either on or off you can't control the temperature/the flame. That was annoying too."}
{"text":"Since the weather is cooling down, we decided to finally try this place. And let me say, it lives up to its reviews. We ordered two pots, the Japanese Miso and the Rib Eye. Both broths had so much flavor and they were both full of seafood,meat and veggies. We tried the Popcorn Chicken because of all of the comments about it. It was crispy, salty and sweet and paired well with rice or plain. For dessert we had strawberry cheecake that was rich and delicious. Joy was our server and she was very attentive and friendly. Our first trip of many to come!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite hot pot place in vegas. It kind of reminds me of Boiling Point in California. I always get the Japanese Miso Pot that is mild - and even the mild is a little spicy for me. You have an option between minced pork rice, regular rice, and vermicelli. My friends got the stinky tofu but they said \"its not really stinky.\" I like to get either the popcorn chicken or the taiwanese sausage for appetizers. Their boba drinks are very good as well - not too sweet."}
{"text":"A friend of mine who lives in Vegas took me here. Remembering the food makes me hungry again. The rib eye beef hot pot was so delicious! Don't forget to order the popcorn chicken. I will definitely come back when I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"I wanna give this place a 5 stars, 
5/5 for amazing service, every second we were there, we were treated so good. The servers are so sweet and very quick to be at your service. Yu was our server by the way! 
5/5 for the hot pot and the price points, 
The hot pot is $13.99 for each pot, you can have your own pot and it's SO filling you don't need to even order appetizers. 
There's many different types of hot pots and it comes with rice or vermicelli. 
I ordered veggie delight, my friend ordered the rib eye pot, and you can also add on extras- seafood, meat or veggies.
The broth is a little plain but that's okay you can always add spices or flavor (which is located on the left side of your table)
As well as they refill your soup with more broth If your pot starts running out of soup which is pretty great. 
They even offer a stamp card so you can come back and get a free hot pot after 10 visits which is crazy I've never seen such thing lol.
I ordered a winter melon green tea with boba at the end and it wasn't too sweet at all, perfect amount of sweet and the boba isn't too hard but it isn't mushy either. 
Definitely coming back forever, the atmosphere is very comfortable. 
The tables are very big, the inside is very spacious and they play pretty good Korean or Japanese music for a Taiwanese place haha (pretty sure it's korean music I recognized some of the artists haha) 
Lastly to add to everything else; I'm pretty sure they don't use that much MSG in their soups because I didn't feel like crap, bloated, or lethargic after eating here. 
This is probably one of the best hot pot places I've been to in Vegas.
(Oh something I haven't mentioned though, they don't give you that much meat or they don't completely fill your pot to the brim. ITS OKAY though, it will still fill you up, so don't look disappointed when you don't see like 10 pieces of rib eye in your pot. Those 4 pieces of meat with the veggies and extra stuff will still be good enough. I mean unless you eat a ton lol) - if that's the case order some appetizers!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to grab a milk tea with boba.  The restaurant was very cute and clean.  The hostess that helped me was very sweet.  I would like to come back to try the food some time in the future.  

Milk tea with boba: 4/5 The milk tea tasted like it had a hint of maple syrup or something? The boba was near perfect.  I would order it again but it wasn't the best I have had."}
{"text":"This is my first trip here....typically I do not like hot soups....but with Vegas weather being crazy as it has been had me craving soup since I woke up cold today.  Lol :)

First impression.  Clean....but also very very empty.  I came in at 11:46AM on a Thursday...I was thinking that it was gonna be busy since it is lunch time.  But worked it for me since I got to choose where to sit. :)

I ordered the Tawainese Chicken poppers...omg...so delicious!  PERFECTLY CRUNCHY....PERFECTLY SEASONED!! :) It was so good.  For the ppl that have had bad ones.  I really would recommend giving it another try. I think it must've been an off day cuz the ones I had was da bomb!!! :D Drooling right now just thinking about them.  Lol

I then ordered the Vegetable Hot Pot. It was a little bland as some of the reviews have stated BUT they have soy sauce on the table.  So I added a spoonful of the soy and it was perfect. The soup was flavorful and honestly I would prefer the soup to come out bland and have to add more soy versus getting it too salty.  You can always add more salt (soy) but u can't take it out. U know?  :)

So overall I gave them 5 stars.  Why?  I have never been to a hot pot place where I didn't have to adjust the soup and theirs was one of the most flavorful ones....and their hot chili sauce on the table was delicious. Service was great and I didn't have to drive all the way to China town to get hot pot.  :) so would I come back?  Definitely!"}
{"text":"I've gotten the ribeye beef hot pot and miso hot pot.

Both have good flavor. Beef gets a little too tough for me since there's no way to stop it from being overcooked. Plenty of veggies in both and I like that there's both seafood and meat in most of their pots so you're always fishing for something different.

Their Chinese bbq sauce on the table goes great with dipping your soup goodies in plus it's homemade. 

The free jasmine green tea was delicious~ regular sweetness was not too sweet which was perfect and the jasmine flavor is prominent. Love that they're served in to-go cups already.

Although it wasn't busy, Mandy was an awesome server!! Thanks for the A++ service! She checked up on each table throughout the meal, refilled drinks and offered to refill the broth; was very attentive overall."}
{"text":"I've never tried Taiwanese hot pot until one of my girlfriends told her to meet her for lunch here. All their hot pots look amazing my favorite is the Seafood one and I get it without the peppercorn and medium spicy. If it's too spicy they can add more broth to it. The service here is exceptional! They are always on top of it and just very friendly. My boyfriend doesn't like hot pot since he's never tried it so he got the popcorn chicken rice dish and he finished the whole plate. I come in at least once a month and the food and service is consistent! I would definitely recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I have to say I really didn't know what to expect because I was told that Pot Tea wasn't all that great and the prices weren't worth it. Well it's either the Resturant listened to what people were saying or what people were saying weren't all that true. 

I actually really liked the food, atmosphere and service here! Oh and the prices is not all that bad at all. 

I order the Strawberry Lemonade not to get mistaken for the Pink Lemonade and it was sooo good. The Wings came out hot and crispy with sweet dipping sauce, yes it was not full of \"in your face\" flavor but it was pretty good and you get a good amount. The popcorn five spice chicken had great flavor and the hot pots were fun as well as pretty yummy. I liked it because I was looking for a healthier alternative for dinner and the variety really help with having something a different to have. 

The people here is super friendly and helpful. Place is super cute and cozy. I will definitely come came here again oh and the mince pork rice was my favorite. For those of you out there who had the Bariatric surgery the Hot Pot here is a great option. The soup is not too salty or sugary and there is way more then enough protein in it to fill you up. 

If you have been I would give it a try if I were you and if you have been thinking about trying it. It's a pretty cool decent place."}
{"text":"I love the vibe from this place. I can't wait for it to get a little colder so I can thoroughly enjoy hot pot. The owner, Wendy, is so nice and you can tell she definitely plays a large role in the day to day business of her restaurant. I'm a sucker for family owned business and she sure is doing it right. This place can get a little crowded during night time. 

try their tea latte, it's black tea with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream :) it's a life changer!"}
{"text":"Hot pots are $12. Appetizers are $5. Got the seafood and tofu hot pot for main course and popcorn chicken for appetizer. They're great! I like the hot pot because it's healthy and yummy. The popcorn chicken is better than Tapioca Express (in SoCal). Service is great. We always have our pot filled with soup and have our glass of water refilled. The interiors are nice and modern. We'll be back... Tip: go from 11-2 because you get free tea! Our server reminded us about that."}
{"text":"Been wanting to go here due to posts via social media from friends and i'm surprised why they went here so often. Wendy and Kevin were me and my girlfriend's servers, they were very welcoming and provided excellent service. Aside from the that, food was amazing had the seafood hot pot and the taiwanese popcorn chicken(very popular item). And if you're not too hungry one hot pot should be enough for 2. Looking forward to come here again with the weather dropping down."}
{"text":"Attentive service, but sorry no . If it's an empty restaurant at night then yknow there's something wrong with it.........."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and will continue to come back. Our waitress was very nice and helpful in helping us find which flavor to get. The Japanese Miso was delicious, we added a side of beef. Oh and the popcorn chicken was very tasty as well. Overall great taste and experience. See you again soon Pot Tea!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try something new and the lobster pot looked great. Unfortunately they are out of lobster at the moment, but we were recommended the ribeye hot pot. SO GOOD!! I got it mild and my husband got medium. The medium was definitely spicy but he loved it. The vibe there was super chill. Kevin was also very friendly and informative. We will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I went tin the first place because it was next to my house. We ordered the kimchi pot and the ribeye pot. I have to say that the ribeye pot was pretty darn good. The kimchi pot was good as well but it was a bit too spicy for my taste although I asked for medium spice. We would definitely go back to the place!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of a kind! I got the Japanese Miso Hot Pot. I enjoyed it and it was loaded with seafood. The flavor of it was authentic and hit the right part-especially with this bipolar Vegas weather! The minced pork rice is delicious!"}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by their beautiful #1 lobster pot. Almost everything in the pot was really good but that lobster was not. There's no telling just how long that little thing was in the freezer before it made it inside my face, but it tasted like ages. The rice and broth were yummy and veggies were fresh. The popcorn chicken was delightful yet super duper salty. I loved my passion fruit green tea but my mate says his milk tea was sub-par. The hot pots were cute and their presentation is pretty and clean. Very nice and attentive wait staff, but a strange atmosphere that didn't quite match the food they were serving. Not sure if I would go here again, but we enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"I had never been to a hot pot restaurant before in my Asian cuisine repertoire, so I was very excited to try this spot out. The vibe is super casual and decor is cute and trendy but simple. 

Our appetizer was the popcorn chicken. It was not what I expected at all as it was a lot sweeter than I expected. Problem solved w a little soy sauce and chili paste mixed together. 

I hate seafood. The menu has A LOT of seafood. They do however offer a vegetarian pot. I ended up opting for the short rib pot, sans the fish balls and squid. The broth was  flavorful (I ordered no slice) and really HOT... hence the name, I guess! If you ask, they will come turn your burner off for you. Additionally, if you run out of broth, they will refill it for you! 

I also ordered the boba milk tea to go with my meal and it was delicious! Definitely a great experience and our server was excellent as well."}
{"text":"The service was as amazing as is the food. They add more broth for you free of charge! All soups were flavorfull as well! Def coming again when we are in vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I swear if you have a picky eater they will love this! I'm pretty picky myself with hot pots but this changed my perspective of it. Customer service is fine as heck! They are so kind and every few minutes they ask you if you want more broth! And if you could buy the strawberry tea BUY IT!!! It tastes like hmmm YOU ATE A PIECE OF HEAVEN!"}
{"text":"Love it here!!! It's my second time coming to this spot! I love the kimchi style hot pot! 
Recommended"}
{"text":"Perfect for coLd season! Place is neat and servers are nice :) one of my favorite spots in the Southwest area"}
{"text":"Tawainese hot pot!! I was super excited to visit this place especially since it is so close to my house. I read a lot of the reviews and many of them spoke of Boiling Point in California as a comparison. So since I happen to love Boiling Point I was extremely curious. 

I had driven by this place so many times but with the name Pot Tea I really had no idea what kind of place it was. 

Service was great. Super friendly and attentive. Not sure if its a family ran restaurant but they seemed to have plenty of workers and the food came out in a timely manner. We started with the chicken wings which were really good. Then I had the spicy miso seafood pot. So much seafood, seriously I was stuffed. The spice was definitely there and had tons of flavor. We also tried the rib eye pot again so much food. The pot doesn't look like a lot but it's filled with tons of yummy food. 

I'll be back sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Great place!! Food was great, everything was yummy! My husband and I shared the Japanese seafood hot pot and side of Taiwanese sausage. Our kids shared popcorn chicken rice platter. Must try ground pork rice, was so flavorful. And the service was Amazing!! One of the best since moving to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Very delicious! I love it! Service can be a bit faster but it's well worth it. They're very stingy with their minced pork rice lol but again it's still good."}
{"text":"Our hang out place for the winter. That day I wanted a soup so we went here for dinner. 

Two thumbs up for service. Our dinner came in fast in no time. We had stinky tofu for appetizer. It was delicious and yes, it was stinky for real! You must brush teeth and rinse well afterwards LOL. We ordered the Rib Eye pot. The pot came with mixed vegetables (mapa cabbage, mushroom, carrots, daikon, tomatoes, tofu), imitation crab meat, noodles, fish balls and slices of fish cakes. You can set your own spicy level. I ordered medium level and add more hot sauce. Haha I love their hot sauce, I have always put lots of them in my soup. Makes it so good and HOT! The minced pork rice was also tasty. 

Popcorn chicken is also my favorite item on their menu. It's Crispy Delicious! Must try! 

They also have variety of Tea and boba, Shaved ice with fresh fruits (mango/strawberry/both). Will come back to try their shaved ice!"}
{"text":"Taiwanese hot pot is great for when you're craving something soupy, and this restaurant has a one-size pot that can be shared or for an individual. Pot Tea Social House is a good pick that's located in the Southwest area near Mountain's Edge/Rhodes Ranch, which is nice if you don't want to go to Chinatown.

I've enjoyed my choices so far, and have favorited the rib eye beef, seafood & tofu, and the Japanese miso. For each pot ordered you have one carb choice, which I highly recommend the minced pork rice that has a lot of flavor and pairs well with the broth. For spice level I usually get a mild or medium, and ask for the chili on the side to add in since it seems to add a different taste to the soup (SO good!) The portion size is very generous, and a pot is more than enough to share with two people and even to have leftovers since the servers will come by with more broth.

I've gotten the popcorn chicken twice before and thought it was average and something that can be skipped, however my favorite appetizer here is the konnyaku spicy cold noodles. The first time I tried this was in July 2016 when it was on a special menu, I recently ordered this and while it was not on a menu, I hope that these noodles will be a permanent option soon!

A regular entree will run about $14. The service is good and attentive. I think the decor is cute with the bamboo in the entrance area, and I like the bench seat options. Definitely will continue to frequent Pot Tea Social House, but I wouldn't suggest others to go out of their way to get here."}
{"text":"This place is perfection within itself. The service is beyond amazing! They always greet us with such proper respect and they are all soooo sweet. We usually get the Rib Eye beef pot and the Veggie delight pot (they even asked me if I wanted to change the broth to beef or pork since the veggie broth is not as flavorful). The hot pots have a light broth and may come off bland to many but it defiantly hits the spot on a cold day or a sick day. The minced pork rice is deceiving, it may not look like much but it's defiantly a MUST TRY cause it is so flavorful. Everything about this place amazing, defiantly a favorite place for us!"}
{"text":"Best hot pot in town their minced pork rice and popcorn chicken is delicious . Very affordable ."}
{"text":"I had a great first experience with hot pots here. I had never tried this concept, but would definitely come back. I tried a mild veggie hot pot and a strawberry green tea. I thought I liked spicy foods, but even the mild broth had pops of spice that were a little too hot for me. If you're a first timer, I recommend not going too hot. Service was fairly quick, but I'd still give yourself an hour or more to sit, dine & enjoy everything."}
{"text":"I started off with their deep fried stinky tofu. It was my first time trying it so I don't have anything to compare it to. I just couldn't get over the stench. If I had a weak sense of smell, I could probably tolerate it. It tasted bland too. I didn't like the dipping sauce it came with either. I won't take off any stars for this dish because I anticipated that I wouldn't like the smell before I tried this dish. When it comes to delicacies, a lot of people don't like it the first time. 

Anyway, all hot pots are now $12.99 except for the lobster hot pot. I ordered the ribeye medium spicy. It wasn't that spicy. I should have gotten extra spicy. Something was missing in the flavor. I'm not sure exactly what was lacking but it was a little on the bland side. I like that I get my individual hot pot though. Depending on how much you eat, one hot pot is more than enough if you're a fatty or enough for two petite girls.

I had to get dessert to cleanse my palate after trying stinky tofu. I ended my dinner with their strawberry, mango, condensed milk shaved ice topped with salted caramel. I wanted to like their specialty but unfortunately I ended up liking dessert the best. 

I can't complain about the service. It was excellent for an Asian place."}
{"text":"HOT POT! I didn't even know this was Taiwanese!
It's one of my first times eating this at a restaurant. This place is right up the street from me yet I've never been here before. 
Anyway! Each hot pot is individual size. I tried the Miso Hot Pot with Minced Pork Rice. With spicy level 3, on a scale of 1-3. 
You have the option to choose White Rice, Minced Pork with rice or Noodles. 
Also the lunch came with a Tea. Could also add boba or whatever in there too I guess. I'm not a fan of tea but I got the Jasmine Green Tea. It wasn't bad but I barely drank it. 
My spicy level 3 wasn't even spicy at all! But it was SO good anyway! I loved it. Lots of pork, seafood, veggies, and tofu in the hot pot. So so so good! I think this is one of my new favorite foods! 
I also felt like I was eating pretty healthy too since its just a light broth + veggies and protein. 
Our server was super nice and friendly. She also gave us this delicious shaved snow dessert with fresh fruit. Nom nom!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my fav soup places in town! The staff is friendly and the owner is super nice and welcoming:)
My kids and I get their popcorn chicken and the hot pots. We've tried them all but I think our fav is the Japanese Miso pot. We love the ribeye one as well. The veggies are always fresh and the pots are always piping hot! Don't forget to ask them to put your flame out after your pot starts boiling! Lol. Great for a steamed facial LOL!
My kids like their iced milk teas and I just like a nice hot cup of tea. 
It's awesome how they will refill your broth if you need or would like more! 
They also have a stamp card. Very nice when you have kids to save some buck$
This is def my fav spot to frequent in the colder months. Although I think I may need to pay this place a visit today. Mmmmmmm sounds so good!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing, everyone was so extremely nice and the food was incredible. Definitely a fun and social restaraunt. Definitely not an \"ordinary\" type of place to go out to eat only because they bring out your soup on a mini stove which just adds to the experience."}
{"text":"The service was good. The individual hot pot was very tasty.  The pork rice that come with it was a great compliment to the hot pot."}
{"text":"Ate here a few times. Nothing bad to say about it ;) it reminds me of Boiling Point in L.A. Not as good as BP but it's close to home and I Love their milk tea!!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try because we were very hungry and hot pot sounded like a great option. This is the first place I've ever been to with individually portioned hot pot, which was kind of nice, especially if you and your partner have very different food preferences.

The atmosphere was nice, we sat at a wooden bench near the windows. The staff were all incredibly friendly, and very helpful to us newbies in explaining how things work. INCREDIBLY nice and attentive staff. 

We ordered boba milk tea, which was delicious (I hadn't had milk tea in over a year and it definitely hit the spot), though it would have been nice if they had different milk tea flavor options. They had about 15 beverage/tea flavors, but only one milk tea option. 

Our hot pots came out and we were informed that the heat could be turned off at any point if it got too hot. About 10 minutes in, I was nearly sweating because the heat being kicked out of that small metal cup, so I requested mine be shut off. I regretted that decision two minutes later when my food got very cold very quickly, but I was almost done anyway so it wasn't that big of a deal. Definitely do NOT get your fire extinguished unless you're done eating, unless you like cold soup....The food itself wasn't bad. A great variety of vegetable and meat/seafood in each of the two hot pots we tried. 

I'd come back to this place if it was closer to my house but sadly I live on the far East side, so this trip was a bit much for us."}
{"text":"Went here to eat hot pot. Although I thought it was family style, they actually had pre made pots on the menu that everyone can individually order. 

I got the the Taiwanese spicy pot and it was pretty good. It lacked a little bit of meat so I would suggested adding it. My friend got he lobster pot and it seemed worth it! 

The pots are pretty big, so if you don't eat much you can probably share. Service was quick and efficient!"}
{"text":"So it says this place close at 10 pm. We got there 9:30 and they said the kitchen closes at 9:30. Does not make sense at all. Instead of putting close time at 10 pm they should put 9:30 pm. On top of that, they ran out of rice. Who runs out of rice?"}
{"text":"I like their service and great food, reasonable shareable size. With each pot you order, you get a free sweet green tea or black tea. Nice touch!"}
{"text":"Had never eaten HOT POT before: I assumed it was like Shabu shabu (which is Japanese hot pot- raw uncooked veggies that you cook on your own). But this place serves CHINESE hot pot which is more stew like an everything is already cooked.
We ordered 2 hot pots for 3 people which I can promise you is more than enough. The 3 of us couldn't even finish the 2 hot pots. 
We ordered
1) popcorn chicken= horrible. Most of the fried pieces were of cooked pieces of batter and not of chicken. It was also served kinda cold and it was truthfully tasteless.
2) Beef hot pot- zero spice= the soup and broth was super bland. large pieces of squid balls, lots of meat, radish, carrots (wouldn't get this again)
3) Taiwanese seafood hot pot- BROTH was a BOMB and super flavorful!!! we ordered spice level 3. Not spicy, just the right amt of spice esp for me, a person who doesn't like spicy at all. Had a chuck of pigs blood, taro, seafood, squid balls and what looked like ramen instant noodle- which was confusing and a little off setting that they would serve that in the hot pot (at least get authentic noodles)

As for the side orders of the addition to the hot pot- THE PORK OVER RICE IS THE BEST and I pretty much would just come back for this. Even ordered a second order. 

Since this is my first hot pot experience its hard to rate it accurately but ill get back once I try somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm a big time soup and hot pot person and this is not one of the better one. I had way better hot pots elsewhere.  For the price the meat and even seafood are skimmed. They even use those cheap 99cents ramen in their hot pot . I never seen anywhere where they use cheap hard ramen."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere when we went there, there wasn't many people. Everything was clean and the high chair was clean. My son spilt soup and they cleaned it up quickly and got him ice since he brunt himself. I love the idea of a personal hot pot. Very cool. I got the veggie pot and the broth did not have much flavor but that's what soy sauce and chili sauce is for! There had interesting vegetable in the pot like taro which was really good. Great service and cute decorations. I would go again!"}
{"text":"This spot just had a soft opening so my friends and I decided to check it out. It's in a nice location on Rainbow, right by Oyshi. We came in and were greeted immediately by the hostess. There was only one other table of guests in the restaurant, so they weren't very busy at all. Understandable since they're brand new. We were told their grand opening will be in May, so hopefully business will pick up for them. 

Let's get to the food. We ordered the sweet potato fries, popcorn chicken, and chicken wings to start with. Sweet potato fries were okay, not my favorite. The popcorn chicken and chicken wings were pretty amazing. Both were crispy and very flavorful, especially with the sweet chili sauce that it came with. For our hot pot, we ordered the rib eye, which was delicious. There were three of us there and it was enough for all of us. The cool part is that when you run out of broth, they'll refill your pot with fresh broth. And the pot is heated up the whole time it's at your table so it doesn't get cold. For dessert, we tried the cheesecake and the salted caramel ice cream. Both were pretty tasty separately, but together, they were amazing.

As far as service goes, the staff was great and attentive the entire time we were there. The owner, Wendy, was kind enough to stop by at our table and ask for our input on what we ate. We had a nice chat about their food and she was very sweet and recommended that we try the stinky tofu next time. Our server, Ariana, was awesome and friendly. The other servers that helped were also great. I'm looking forward to many more visits to this place!

Also... bring cash! The one and only downside was they were only taking cash at the time, which was understandable. We had cash, so it wasn't a huge inconvenience at the time. I'm assuming they'll start taking credit cards eventually, so hopefully they'll have that taken care of by the time they have their grand opening."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's because I have a toddler who just got potty trained but the name did give me a few giggles.  This restaurant though is quite serious about it's casual but modern design and it's awesome food.  You enter into a large space that is bright, casual yet tasteful, a mixture of rustic wooden tables and benches with more industrial chairs.  Coupled with very warm and attentive service, this place is perfect for families and dates. Personally I am not a huge fan of shabu-shabu or hot pots, but this place has definitely converted me into a wanna-repeat customer.  (Thanks for bringing me here wifey!)

From 11am-2pm, you get free green or black tea with your lunch which you can have sweetened or unsweetened.  We had the Taiwanese popcorn chicken and my hubby, son and I LUVED it.  Popcorn chicken can be so boring and hard and chewy but these have a delicate crunch and light but savory seasoning and it comes with basil leaves.  Mmmmmm.  I ordered 2 plates and didn't get to take any home.  My friend ordered the chicken wings and I didn't feel like trying them coz it looked dry and they didn't care for it too much either, said there wasn't much flavor in the chicken itself so you can skip this.  

For the bowls, hubby had the Rib Eye and I had the Kimchi bowl.  Let's start off with my Kimchi bowl, when it was served in their adorable containers over a live fire, even with the mild spice level that broth was EXTREMELY spicy.  It was more manageable when I had the fire under my bowl put off but man, was I sweatin!  The broth was very tasty and I enjoyed the mix of meat, vegetables, seafood and pseudo-seafood elements in my bowl.  I had beef, shrimp, scallop, squid, mussel, clams... the works.  Add a few more meat toppings and 2 people can share this bowl with an extra cup of rice.  I definitely enjoyed both the filling and broth of my bowl much more than my husband's order, which I thought was quiet bland.  

However, they have this wonderful condiment pronounced \"sha tsa\" sauce which reminds me of a marriage between chili paste and bagoong (shrimp paste).  My friend said it's called Chinese barbecue sauce made with dried scallops.  It is very addicting and you can bump up the flavor of your hotpot to your liking.  

If you are into hotpots, sharing and clearing up a stuffy nose, definitely stop by this Pot Tea.  Teehee.  Seriously, they've got some good stuff!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is new, clean, and nice. The service is great. Our waitress took time to explain the menu and show us the size of pot. We didn't have any appetizer. I had spicy beef pot and hubby had seafood tofu pot. All hotpot's price are $11.99 (except one). Although the presentation is neat but the broth tasted very plain. Actually, no flavor at all. I hope they have some kind of fish sauce or salt on the table. Not very good!"}
{"text":"I have to say, this is the only GOOD hot pot place in Vegas that I know about. Everytime I come here, the staff is exceptionally friendly. This of course, does not compare to Blooming Hot Pot, but it does the job. The only reason why they did not get five stars is because I just wish they had a little more flavor to their broth. Prices are also decent. Do not eat here if you are allergic to seafood, they list Beef as one of their entrees, but it also includes fish balls, crab cakes, etc."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time on my husband's birthday back in September. ...and we loved it. We ordered the popcorn chicken for appetizer and 2 hot pots. Service was extremely awesome. We will definitely be back soon. Very soon"}
{"text":"I would like to give  3.5 rating for this place. My second time here and I feel there has been some improvements. The hotpot soup base has more flavor than the last time I went. I do have to say the place was very cool even in the 100 plus degree weather! So no need to worry about sweating up a storm inside! I believe that can improve some more but over all the soup is delicious as it comes with either white rice, vermicelli, and or white rice with mince pork!"}
{"text":"Really great individual hot pot spot. The Taiwanese popcorn chicken is out of control good. Some of the best service I've experienced at a restaurant anywhere ever. The hot pot is as good as it gets and the desert is phenomenal. Haven't had a bad experience yet, and I'm so glad they're in Southwest!"}
{"text":"this palce is the best..wendy..hostess is on top of her game..everyone so nice and the food is just incredible...try it..you will be back, i work in the restaurant business and i was amazed by the taste, the price and the service!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and good is good and it's perfect for me cus it's right across from my apartment. I like coming here at least once or twice a month."}
{"text":"Came here based on reviews... I couldn't eat the hotpot it was awful. I had 3 bites, each bite trying to just accept that it wasn't that good and just eat it... I couldn't. I have no idea why the high reviews. My husband thought it was disgusting too. The popcorn chicken had good flavor seasoning but the meat could not be identified... Looked and tasted like animal byproduct. Only positive is the nice decor, which is very modern. Maybe the good reviews are coming from people just coming in for tea? I'm so confused."}
{"text":"Mild means not TOO spicy. Both hot pots we ordered were supposed to be mild and they were way too spicy. 

The sweet potato fries were good. (Hence the extra star)

The hot pot tasted too strongly of ginger."}
{"text":"It's been 2 years since I've been back to this restaurant.. used to come here a lot when they first opened.  The hot pot still taste the same, and I still ordered the same pot #2 Ribeye and very spicy .   I love the option of either  w minced pork( very good) or vermicelli.

The price when up by a dollar..hehe .. it's $13.99 Now. A good size pot for individual (well for me anyways) hehe..  I also love  their teas, very good.  Go there during lunch cuz it's free or not you have to pay $3.99 for the tea!"}
{"text":"Lalalala love this place! Just look at my pictures.....DROOL.  Hands down the best popcorn chicken I've ever had. It's actually Taiwanese popcorn chicken for only $5.99 and they give you a good portion size. My husband and I also gjjot the chicken wings and #7 Japanese Miso soup. Everything was delicious! To top it off the customer service was on point. Very friendly and a clean environment. The best part is that we shared everything. Our bill was $29.15 and we are stuffed. We will definitely come back. You have to check this place out. 

Appetizers $5.99
Hot pots $12.99 unless you are getting the hot pot withqwwwwwwa lobster $19.99"}
{"text":"The seafood pot is really good. The rice and ground pork compliments the food very well. During lunch they offer the complimentary tea wich helps refresh with the soup. Love it!"}
{"text":"This place was nice, the customer service was on point. I've only eaten Taiwanese hot pot twice, once here and the other time in California, i.e the famous Boiling Point.
For starters I like the black tea, but I think i should be a tad bit sweeter but its fine. For appetizers we ordered the popcorn chicken, I didn't like as much, the flavor was fine but the texture was crispy enough, some parts were still soggy and it kinda killed it for me.
The hot pot it self was good, but unlike Boiling point, they didnt have many sauces to choose from, they had your basic chili oil and ponzu. I LIKE VARIETY. but the flavor of the broth was still delicious, in fact I think it has better flavoring than Boiling Point.
Besides the disappointing popcorn chicken, I like this place and will be coming again :)"}
{"text":"The tea is good, but the food is not. All of the \"fish\" in the hot pots are artificial and tasteless. I will not eat here again nor do I recommend others to eat here."}
{"text":"I love this place. Whenever I crave seafood and soup I usually stop by here. I tried kimchi seafood soup it was so good! Comes In a pot per person some people can even share if you not a foodie like me. Comes with either steamed rice, pork minced rice or noodles. 
Staff is really nice and helpful. I'm glad they are close to where I live."}
{"text":"This opened not too long ago but I wanted to go ever since I saw the sign up. I finally got my chance!  I used to have Taiwanese food more often when I lived in CA. 

We started off with the fruit flavored green tea. I got passion fruit, hubby got strawberry. These were delicious!  Very sweet though. The flavor reminded me of Asian candy.  Like the bubblegum they sell at Sanrio. I had to pace myself since it was hot out!

We got the chicken wings and popcorn chicken. From the looks of the apps, I would've assumed I'd enjoy the popcorn chicken more, but I liked the wings way more.  Our 2-year-old are most of the wings. 

Hubby got rib eye hot pot and I got seafood hot pot.  I really liked it. I did feel I needed to add lots of sauce to get more flavor, but I appreciated that it wasn't too salty. It was boiling (as expected). I wish they had a way to blow out the fire underneath the pot before it burns out on its own. 

Our daughter ate all the fish and tofu out of my pot and loved it. 

I like the picnic style tables. They make it easier for my kid to fidget. 

I wish they sold beer and wine. Maybe I'm a lush, but i do enjoy a beverage with my dinner. I'm sure the license is pricey, so I'm not mad about it. 

Service was great. They even come around asking if you'd like more soup. We didn't need more, but it was a nice touch. Then service went a little downhill at the end.  I don't know if it's our luck, or if it's an off-strip Vegas restaurant thing, but we always seem to get held hostage waiting for our check. I hate having to ask for it. Bachi Burger is the worst with this, so Pot Tea didn't seem like such a bad wait. We sat there maybe 20 minutes (we've waited almost an hour to pay the bill at Bachi before so I guess this wasn't too bad). 

All in all, I'd go back. Especially when it starts getting cold out."}
{"text":"On a cold day, this is my favorite place to come eat! My husband and I usually share the Rib-eye pot because it's pretty big and each of us gets an order of minced pork rice. I like how you can get more broth at anytime. We also enjoy the popcorn chicken for an appetizer. Definitely a place to try if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"Best first time experience! Everything was just beyond amazing :) Everyone just welcomes you right when you come in the store and the store itself is already cozy! 
Its different than any other Asian cuisine I have tried. Its my first time having a hot pot and I am glad I went here. Everyone should seriously try it!"}
{"text":"My new obsession. Loved everything here.  

My fav so far: stinky tofu and kimchi pot"}
{"text":"This is the best hot pot place ever. The quality of the meat and vegetables are so fresh. You can tell the broth was made very well. The service is good and the servers are easy to talk to. They make sure you get everything you need and they were helpful when I ordered my food. My favorite thing about pot tea is that they refill your hot pot with more broth!! The hot pot portion looks small but it can easily make two people full and satisfied. My bf and I made the mistake of getting each a hotpot and we couldn't even finish half of it(and we eat a lot too). I wish I could give this restaurant more than 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've passed by Pot Tea so many times, and always thought the name was super cute but assumed that it was just a tea house with finger foods/sandwiches. My friend suggested hot pot and we ended here. When I first walked in, there was a very weird smell... I wasn't sure if it was due to a candle or air freshener, but my friend said it was their stinky tofu. I eventually got used the smell throughout my meal and it didn't bother me as much. 

Pot Tea offers milk teas, regular teas, appetizers and hot pot. I was excited to try Pot Tea in hopes of satisfying my Boiling Point cravings while in Vegas. Prices here are a tad bit higher. The hot pot comes in a metal pot and there's a flame underneath the pot to keep it boiling hot during your entire meal. If you want it turned off then just ask and they will do it for you. They are also really good about refilling your soup base with more soup. 

Hot pot lunch ($13.99) includes: 
- Green or black tea (sweetened or unsweetened)
- Your choice of steamed rice, minced pork rice or noodles
- Any of the hot pot options except the Lobster one. 

We started off with the chicken wings. They were crispy and super hot when they came out. I think they gave us some sort of sweet & spicy sauce on the side but we did not end up using it. I thought the wings were well seasoned on its own. 

I ordered the mild rib eye with noodles and a sweetened green tea. I think my friend ordered a mild pork & clam pot with the minced meat rice and a sweetened black tea. I was very surprised that the green tea was good. The tea flavor wasn't overly strong and it wasn't super sweet. There was a lot of stuff in the Rib Eye hot pot compared to boiling point but the soup base wasn't very good. It was spicy, but was lacking some salt or something.

Overall, food was OK. Tea was good, but service was excellent. I will be back."}
{"text":"Decided to try Pot Tea Social House. Was recommended by a friend since she posted some photos of the food here and looks very tasty. I came in with my family and we decided to order Popcorn Chicken and different variety of hotpots. I was very surprised that the food was very DELICIOUS and had some taste to it. I hope to come back soon to try the other hotpots!"}
{"text":"I've been dying to give this place a try since I enjoyed Boiling Point in LA and was thinking it was the closest thing I could get to that restaurant so I had very high expectations. Unfortunately it did not meet my expectations :( The hot pot was too bland and flavorless, even the sauces on the table didn't help.
 
However, the Minced Pork Rice and Popcorn Chicken were tasty and honestly those two are the only thing I'd come back for. Plus I give 5/5 stars for the service."}
{"text":"It was my second time here . In this time me and my friend ordered japanese miso and kimchi spicy . They both taste good but i kinda like kimchi spicy more this time . We also order pork hock appetizer. Its wasnt that impressed . The decorations was nice . The service was good . I was so impressed with my waittress she was nice and checked often . Overall i like pot tea here"}
{"text":"The seafood hot pot was good.  Pork rice was delicious. Popcorn chicken was ok, didn't care for the dark meat.  We did, both, end up with a little food poisoning. :("}
{"text":"UM , YuM! 
Best food and fLavor in the area for my palate. Pork on steamed white rice and this DeLiSH seafood bowL; even MOM was impressed. And MOM isn't wowed very often. 
Bravo BRAVO to the folks that run this place ... Thank you to your CooKs and your staff. 
The lichee tea with boba aLso YUM. 
See you again reaL soon... I'm already craving another bowL."}
{"text":"Perfect place for Hot Pot, good atmosphere, fast / friendly service and great prices. If you come between the hours of 11am - 2pm get a free tea."}
{"text":"The best thing is the service and the portions. They are attentive, nice and the food is pretty good. Not the best Pho but some of the best service. I have only been there once I need to try it again to give it a more fair review. 

I had the chicken pho, it was hot and full of stuff. They have serve it in a pot with a flame that keeps it hot while you are eating it. its a very cool experience. I love choosing my own noodles and I ejoy the experience. I only had pho but I will be back to try the teas and other stuff I hear good things about."}
{"text":"There are a lot of options when it comes to hot pot places and it is an indirect goal of mine to eat at every one of them. 

The service was great, I'm not sure what our servers name was so I'm going to just call him Paul. Paul did a great job at making sure our drinks were all filled during our wait before and after we ordered. Paul got all of our special requests right the first time. Paul is awesome. Be like paul.

The soup definitely could have used a bit more flavor, all the veggies were fresh and the sides were delicious.

I missed the part where this place was supposedly specialized in making something called stinky tofu.. or stinky soup... or something that has to do with anything stinky.. so I will have to come back and stink the place up.

Good job paul-"}
{"text":"Tea was decent.

Food was decent.

I'd almost want to give this a 5 star rating for being in the south west area, since not many other things like this exist there. But the food wasn't super amazing. I probably won't put this on my regular list of places to visit. But I'll give it 4 stars for location and decency."}
{"text":"Disappointingly mediocre at best.

I was really hoping to find a Taiwanese tea house that had good popcorn chicken, good boba, and other delicious food items.  

Unfortunately, this is not that place.  

I ordered the popcorn chicken with a medium spice level.  And was told, \"oh, we don't have spice levels for our popcorn chicken.\"  

So I responded, \"what spice level does it come at?\"

\"There is no spice level.\"

OK...already not a good sign (on top of the fact that they charge $6.50 for popcorn chicken!!!), but I went ahead and ordered some, hoping that maybe it would still be delicious.  

Nope.  It was as bland as can be.  I mean, how do you mess up popcorn chicken?!  

Ordered a Japanese miso hot pot.  That was...mediocre.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good either.  

On the upside, the minced pork rice was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Awesome service! I was hoping for something like shabu shabu, but even so, it was really filling for the price."}
{"text":"This restaurant would be an amazing spot in the winter when you need to warm up. That being said it was pretty amazing regardless. I had the veggie hot pot. They immediately explained that it was all veggie broth in this pot and asked if I'd like any other kind of broth to add flavor. I'm a vegetarian, but ok with broths so I asked for beef broth. The veggies were delicious. My only complaint is that the soup stays boiling the entire time, and it was so hot to eat when you just want to gobble it up. I also had the stinky tofu appetizer which came with a yummy dipping sauce, as well as a milk yea boba. The service was very attentive and the food was excellent as well as vegetarian friendly. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I went there a week ago. The service was great. We ordered chicken pop as an appetizer it was ok and we had spicy hot pot as our main. It was plain and not spicy at all."}
{"text":"Not good I was asking for mild spice broth and she give to me with 10 chilly  is really to spice. I CAN NOT EAT. I LOSE MY MONEY $15 ,SORRY BUT IS THE TRUTH. =("}
{"text":"First one visiting...  They have hot pots for individual portions, but if you're not too hungry sharing an appetizer and a hot pot for two would be a great meal.

Ordered
1) Taiwanese Sausage
-Sweet flavored sausage 
-I dipped in chili
-Dish was ok, I wouldn't be heartbroken if I never had it again

2) Beef Rib Eye Hot Pot and accompanied with rice and minced pork
-would definitely get again
-decent amount of veggies/meat/tofu etc
-feel free to order mild, medium, or hot
-would get again
-great flavor

3) Popcorn Chicken
-I recommend adding some chili for added flavor
-Dish was ok, but could use more flavor in the batter

4) Black tea with lavender aromatics
 -flavor was nice, but I could do this at home. Buy black tea packets and an aromatic infuser to add whatever you prefer
(Food 4 out 5 stars)

Service staff were friendly and constantly smiled. Pleasant, relaxed, and casual atmosphere.
(Because the staff were overly pleasant, I scored the venue 5 out of 5 stars)

Would return... :)

Note:  For the items listed above, the total was approximately $50 (rounding up) including tip."}
{"text":"This place is such a great jem! I'm so happy that this place is only minutes away from where I live. LOVE THE Kim Chee, Taiwanese, and RIB EYE. Get one of these bad boys, you'll come back for 2nd's for SURE!!! BTW, great service and a very attentive staff."}
{"text":"Perfect for winters in Vegas! The hot pots are the perfect size for a hungry individual or great to share if you want to partake in some other dishes (which is highly recommended!). We ordered the veggie hot pot and substituted the veggie broth for pork broth which the owner told us takes 8 hours to make! With one spoonful you can tell that the difference. It tastes so clean, smooth and so delicious!

We also ordered the Taiwanese sausage, spicy cold noodles, minced pork over rice and Taiwanese popcorn chicken. All the dishes were seasoned perfectly and complemented each other. 

Their drink menu is also extensive and I wish I were able to order all of them! Alas I can't have caffeine so the fresh made strawberry lemonade was recommended and it was very refreshing. 

This is definitely on our must visit places every time we come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Finally got to give this place a try & it hasn't disappoint for hot pot. You get a pretty good portion of seafood, vegetables & meat in your pot. My personal favorite is the Japanese miso pot and price is definitely affordable! I recommend this place to anyone who loves hot pot!"}
{"text":"The food was quietly amazing. I was not here since 2016 and it was as good as I remembered.  The staff was very informative and constantly checking on me. Even though it was good but I think the broth could have be less salty. But overall experience was great."}
{"text":"Definitely the best hot pot in Las Vegas. We've tried many places here and this one is the best."}
{"text":"Been here several times now.  Seems like their soup broth (specifically the Taiwanese spicy broth) is slowly getting better and better.  The popcorn chicken is decent, and the service is great.  Will be visiting this place more from now on.

Advice to the owners: the spiciness level of the hot pots seems a little inconsistent at times.  It might be easier if you guys just put chili oil on the tables and let everyone adjust it to their own liking."}
{"text":"Food was ok, very bland with not much seasoning.
Pricey for the selection.
Not much to say besides underwhelmed."}
{"text":"The ambience at Pot Tea is warm and inviting. My husband and I came in for some shaved ice. It was sweet, creamy dreamy treat. The owners were very nice. They even sat down to chit chat with us. If you are looking for a place to relax and enjoy a good food come to Pot Tea Social House!"}
{"text":"Service was great. We signed in, picked a number, and shortly after we were seated. This place is great for big families/parties. The hot pot bowl portions are big enough for two people.  The only bummer was the lack of meat. I had to order extra ribeye due to the lack of meat in their bowls.  The popcorn chicken was full of flavor but very fatty at the same time.  I prefer the traditional hot pots where they serve raw meat and vegetables on a plate and you cook it in the broth though."}
{"text":"We had the 3 different pots, popcorn chicken, minced pork on rice and vermicelli.  Everything was delicious.  I still think the vermicelli should be in the pot so soften it up a bit.  The service is friendly and very helpful.  You gotta try it at least once!!!!"}
{"text":"good neighborhood hotpot place.

one thing that sets this place apart from all the other hotpot places in the area is that it is a clean, arguably trendy place. this is probably the one and only hotpot place in the area where you can bring your gf on a \"date.\" not a fancy date, but not a place with mismatched plates and bossy middle aged asian women giving you the stink eye.

pros: presentation of hot pot is good. flavor is decent. maybe the best boba in the neighborhood?

cons: service is a bit slow, which, i'm not sure why since all they serve is hotpot. shouldn't it be immediate? not the most flavorful. 

overall a good addition to the neighborhood. clean. decent. definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent service. My husband ordered spicy tofu & I ordered the beef pot. Delish flavors, plenty of veggies, meat and they refill the soup. Also ordered popcorn chicken appetizer crispy, lychee green tea tastes like fresh lychee. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great FILLING lunch. Tried the seafood hot pot with tofu spicy level medium. Whooo it was spicy, a good level spicy- they also brought extra spice sauce on the side, in case we needed more. 

I read prior reviewers said the broth wasn't flavorful enough- I found it to be really flavorful and perfectly salted/umami. The seafood dish includes shaved pork, tofu in addition to rolled fish balls, flakes of white fish, fish cakes sliced, mussels, clam, crab (but was kind of difficult to eat), shrimp (but whole shrimp with the yucky vein still in it). All in all, aside from those couple of glitches, it was a shmorgasborg of festive seafood for a great price and yummy!

Service was wonderful, our server  explained the dishes and sauces to us newbies, turned our hot-pot flames out when we were ready and checked in with us to see if we needed extra broth towards the end. After our meal and finished teas, we stayed to chat for awhile and our server checked in again to see if we wanted waters or any other drinks. So thoughtful! Will be back."}
{"text":"They have a variety of hot pot . We ordered the kim chi hot pot and the spicy beef hot pot , both were delicious . They were generous with the portion. Sae , our waitress had a beautiful smile and was very friendly . She explained the different hot pots . Overall a great experience ."}
{"text":"Good alternative to pho, I've had different kinds of shabu shabu this to me is mediocre. Popcorn chicken is also mediocre same stuff you get from boba tea houses. Good thing the prices are not outrageous"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, been meaning to eat here for months since I live close by.
Glad we did!

Service: best service I've had in a LONG time! Kevin was our server and he was GREAT! Another lady helped us too but I didn't catch her name unfortunately... But anyways, our water was never empty we were constantly asked if we needed more broth, if our pots needed to be turned off if we needed ANYTHING they were on it! 

Food: I ordered the Seafood/ tofu hot pot level 3. It wasn't incredibly spicy ( but I can handle a lot of spice) but it was the PERECT amount! They don't go light on the ingredients either, every time I went into the pot there was more meat and veggies galore! Thank you for not being cheap on the ingredients. ( was told it's all fresh with no MSG too!) my BF ordered the Taiwanese spicy hot pot, I was envious of his noodles in his. I didn't ask but hopefully you can ask for noodles in any dish. It didn't matter too much because I was FULL and couldn't finish all of my meal but my BF was happy to help haha. 
We also ordered Boba tea! I had the winter melon green tea and YUMMM SOO good! I'll stop by just for that on a hot day. 

I'll be back! In the winter you'll see me here a lot. 
I'm not a hot pot expert but I know this was a great experience and especially if you're a newbie like me make sure to come here they have no problem explaining everything!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. Great service people are always happy and smiling. My favorite is the seafood hotpot with rice and minced pork  seasoned with  their shrimp paste . What a mouth pleaser salty , spicy and yummy. I tried the lobster also but because of the hot soup and heat it was a little chewy . The beef hotpot was delicious too .  I love the enoki mushrooms. The stinky tofu was  not great I think it is an acquired taste and smell. My treat is the green tea with boba it comes in different flavors but I love green tea . I do request for less sweetener cause the tea tends to be a little too sweet. I took my niece and nephew here , they are from California n thy love it too nice cozy place to enjoy good food and company."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good the price is reasonable and the place has a quiet atmosphere.  The customer service is fantastic we were greeted right away and was seated in a short period of time."}
{"text":"??! 
Great food, service and chill environment. 

Try the prime rib and Taiwanese popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"Good good, excellent service. Servers are very attentive, they gave me a warm welcome since I walked it. Clearly guide me thur the menu. Food taste good, reasonable pricing. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for their hot pot because of the cold weather. The staff was really nice and attentive. 

I ended up ordering the beef hot pot along with popcorn chicken, sweet potato fries, and strawberry shaved ice. My favorite part of the meal was seriously the sweet potato fries because of their taste, although it could have been crispier. The hotpot could have been way better in terms of the flavor of the broth (which was lacking) and the quality of the beef. The meat was chewy and tough. I also don't like the fact that they already put everything into the pot so the longer it takes you to eat, the more overcooked your food will be. Other places I've been to just keep everything separated from the broth so you can regulate how much you want to cook at a time. The strawberry shaved ice was okay at best, but it could have used more condensed milk. Once you finish the other layer, the inside is basically just ice. Other places don't skimp out as much for their toppings and flavorings. 

Overall, I wouldn't really recommend going here for their hotpot. There are some really good places in Chinatown so I suggest you look around that area."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service experience. This place is like California's Boiling Point chain, so if some of you know what I'm talking about, then you'll definitely appreciate the greater customer service at Pot Tea. We will come back just because of the excellent customer service because that's how big we are about it, especially when it comes to Asian restaurants. 

Food is good. We got the Stinky tofu hot pot and seafood hot pot. They were both really good. But the stinky tofu wasn't stinky enough. Lol. Fermented tofu isn't everyone's cup of tea so try at your own risk. Wish they had beer here. Lol. The popcorn chicken isn't bad. Everyone likes it so I would also recommend it. 

I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"When I walked in here, I was expecting to be sharing one big hot pot with my friends as is common with traditional Asian hot pot. Instead, the pots here are served as one-people portions, which is a little disappointing (and pricey) when you're coming with a group, but is actually not bad for people who want to eat hotpot by themselves. 

The interior is very bright and friendly. There are seating options for bigger groups, as expected of a \"Social House.\"  

No complaints about the service. The servers are quick, nice, and efficient in their work, and will answer any questions that customers have about the menu and the pricing of the items. Our hot pots and drinks were always kept refilled without us having to ask.

The popcorn chicken we ordered was good, but the hot pot was better! I love how the broth can be customized and is relatively clear. It really lets me enjoy the sauce for the meat that much more. The meat was also fresh, nicely cut, and of high quality. 

Given the small portions, Pot Tea is a little more on the pricey side, but they do serve good-quality meat, so it's not unreasonably expensive. I would come again."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to their Taiwanese spicy hot pot!! It's absolutely delicious. Very reasonably priced but very generous portion size. 
I added baby bok choy and shrimp to my hot pot. I went with medium spice level. It had noodles in it (a lot!) but also came with pork rice on the side. So tasty... how did they make that rice so good!? Seriously I could eat here everyday. I can come here myself and not feel funny. I saw a couple of people eating here alone. 
The waitress, Wendy was super sweet and attentive. I never saw a Taiwanese person that friendly like her in my life. Love it :-)
I also had their jasmine green tea. Oh my god, it was so good and refreshing. What a difference from the jasmine tea I make at home...  
I'm a fan!! Next time, I want to try their creamy hot pot which is not on the menu. Looked so delicious!!
*If you have left over soup (stock) in the hot pot, add rice in it. You can also order side of egg and put it in. Out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place and it's so close to my parent's house - literally 2 min away. I was here last August and it reminded me of The Boiling Point in Cali. I love Taiwanese hotpot and this place is perfect for it! I love that I don't have to cook anything myself. Their Taiwanese sausage, drinks and minced beef over rice were all so good. I highly recommend. It's a clean place as well. I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Date & Time: 5/9/16 @ 8ish pm

After work I decided that I wanted to try something different. I didn't realize how far this location was, but in the end it was worth it. This shop is really cute with all the decor inside of it. 

We started off with the popcorn chicken, which is so amazing and delicious. The hotpot comes with pork rice -which is amazing !!!!! I could just eat the rice with the popcorn chicken. The hotpot comes with a sort of things inside of it. The hotpot looks small, but it is super filling (like so filling, I had to stretch out before headed back home). Our waitress was really adorable and super friendly, she told us you can keep the flame on or to ask her when to turn it off. I tried to keep mine on as long as possible, but that shit boils over and gets super hot ! 

Price:
2 hotpots (Ribeye and Taiwanese Spicy Pot)
1 popcorn chicken
2 waters
toal is about $36"}
{"text":"used to be a loyal customer, but my recent experience has been getting worse and worse.  I've been coming to this restaurant since they opened, and everything used to be perfect, but starting this year, I began to notice the food quality has been going down hill, if you order any pot with beef or lamb, all the meat have some kind of \"tumor\" looking chewy stuff all over it, I cannot even chew it and had to spit it out, I can't enjoyed my food at all.  I can tell instantly the meat quality they used were very low, and this happens to me several time already and I kept going back to see if they will improve but it's the same every single time.  Not to mention they kept raising the price from $11.99 when they first opened and now it's $13.99 with no improvement in meat quality at all.  I'm very very disappointed, I will not support such business who raise price and downgraded the food quality.  Not only they will lose a few loyal customer, they will lose many more because I will not recommend my friends and family to go there anymore."}
{"text":"This is such a fun place to come visit with friends! Kei was so sweet and her recommendations were"}
{"text":"I've never had hot pot before but I figured I would give this place a try.  They have 11 different pots and most contain seafood. I'm not really a seafood eater so I had the fish taken out of the lamb pot. I wasnt sure how to eat it and I quickly realized that hot pots are just not my thing.  When I went in,  there were only a few other tables so the service was attentive. I did have to wait 20 minutes for my food,  but I think that was more of the kitchen being slow.  My server was friendly but a little awkward and quiet. She also never introduced herself,  so I have no clue what her name is."}
{"text":"Ordered #7 extra spicy -Japanese miso which has seafood and beef. The broth was very good. Better than #2- the ribeye. 
Order the chicken wings for an appetizer! They're perfect."}
{"text":"I ordered: Rib eye beef pot ($14), Taiwanese sausage ($6), Passion fruit tea w/ tapioca ($4)

Pros:
* Clean restaurant
* The owner made sure my request was met when a server overlooked our table twice
* Free refills of the broth for the hot pot
* The rice w/ minced pork was very very delicious!

Cons:
* It was quite pricey for what you get, especially the sausage. For $6, I would expect a bigger serving
* The hot pot was bland for me.

I gave them 3 stars for their service & ambiance. I may go back in hopes that their hot pot will be more flavorful... and maybe a little cheaper...?"}
{"text":"Single serving hot pot Taiwanese style. Don't let the name fool you, they do have Tea. They have different varieties of hot pots and spicy ratings. The staff super friendly and nice. This place is a must for hot pot lovers and newbies, especially on the west side of town. No MSG too!!! Also, secret menu for the rice dish too."}
{"text":"Great service and good hot pot. Wish more vegetable in the pot."}
{"text":"Excellent hot pot restaurant with generous portions. My wife and I love the Taiwanese popcorn chicken, Taiwanese pork hocks stew, deep fried stinky tofu, different varieties of drinks, and the 11 different varieties of hot pot  to choose from. The selection will have something for everyone. I will emphasize this point which no other restaurant in town as what this hot pot joint is offering: authentically Taiwanese."}
{"text":"Had the pork hock and prime rib hot pot it was delicious! Customer service was excellent! Which is hard to find in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my fav and the only restaurant that serve real Taiwanese style hot pot in town! Love the environment, friendly staffs, many varieties and the location is super easy to find! I would totally recommend to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend reeeeally enjoyed the fried chicken wings...other than that, this place was alright."}
{"text":"I went to visit Vegas - AGAIN to spend some time with the family and friends. My sister and mom had a craving for this place so of course, my fiance and I decided to tag along. 

When we walked in, the place was not too busy and seemed welcoming. There was no fancy, trendy, asian fusion ambiance going on which was a relief to me. Sometimes, I like the chill, let's go grab something to eat, and not spend an arm and a leg kind of place. This was it.

I had no idea what to order - so we settled for the Taiwanese Spicy Pot with mild spice. Boy, was that thing spicy! I highly doubt I would put that as a mild spice. The portions were generous - one pot was shared between my fiance and I. The flavor was ok - nothing to rant and rave about. If it was a cold day and I needed to warm up, I definitely would head to this place in a minute. 

The check was inexpensive - for four people, two pots = less than $40. We even left with a doggy bag! Not bad.."}
{"text":"Food was enjoyable and servers were kind and very attentive. I had the #10 Sour Pickled Mustard with Lamb Pot. I like how it was served with the flame under the pot so it stays hot. No complaints! :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go to with friends and family. Im a soup lover and being originally from singapore living in Vegas for the past 10 years, this reminds me of home. The prices are affordable and they have a variety of hotpots to choose from. I also love their boba drinks and everytime i visit, the staffs are always super friendly"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I believe it was a little overpriced for what you get.
I tried the steak the lobster the lamb hot pots they were decent. Appetizers were good and Boba drink were good too."}
{"text":"Solid Taiwanese joint in SW Vegas! I've been here for their hot pot as well as their popcorn chicken. I love me some popcorn chicken! The popcorn chicken can either be an appetizer before your hot pot or you can get a platter that comes with rice, veggies and an over easy egg. 

They have a wide selection of hot pot sets to choose from. Ranging from lobster to rib eye to veggie to stinky tofu, you're sure to find something to choose The hot pot set comes in your own pot that is individually heated so you can choose how hot (or not) you want your soup to end up. Their broth's aren't jam packed with flavor though iirc so just be aware of that. It's no flavor explosion in your mouth but it's still pretty good.

They also offer several Taiwanese side dishes/appetizers like popcorn chicken, pork hock, stinky tofu, fries as well as a small selection of milk teas. (Which I haven't tried yet)

Especially this time of year, it's the perfect weather to slurp down some hearty hot pot! There is lots of parking in the lot for this restaurant"}
{"text":"5 stars for service! Everyone is right, the service is spectacular here, such friendly staffs, always checking and refilling our water whenever needed. 

I am used to Boiling Point Taiwanese hot pot which is more spicier and flavorful. So I didn't enjoy the Taiwanese hot pot here since it lacked flavor. I also didn't enjoy the pork blood mixed with rice :(. However I have ought to try different flavor hot pots here :)

I really really enjoyed the popcorn chicken! Yummmmmm.

My friend had the rice with pork and it was delicious. 

Defiantly coming back because of the awesome service! :)"}
{"text":"OBSESSED. Las Vegas has a handful of hot pot restaurants, and Pot Tea Social is definitely on my top three. 

Food: they have a total of 11 different pots, ranging from rib eye beef to lobster and even a veggie delight pot to cater to the vegans/vegetarians. All their pots all filled with a delicious broth, various meats, various vegetables, and an option for steamed rice, minced pork or vermicelli on the side. If it's your first time, I highly recommend the rib eye beef pot with minced pork rice. That pot has a ton of stuff, like fish cake, tomatoes, cuttlefish ball, corn, quail egg, squid, etc. Don't be scared, all the flavors do go well together and it's literally the perfect meal for the fall/winter season. The meat to soup ratio is great, I was able to eat a spoonful of food with my soup, without having an uneven balance of soup or meat/veggie at the end. The minced pork is very unique because it's not too heavy but still juicy enough to eat with the ingredients in your soup. They also have appetizers like sweet potato fries, chicken wings, popcorn chicken, and deep fried stinky tofu. All around, it is a great fusion of Asian and American food. 

Service: I've been here for both lunch and dinner, and both times they were slow. The service is average and I can't say they are too personable because it depends on your server that day. They are quick with getting the food out and checking on you at least one to either refill your water or to turn off the fire. I have nothing to complain because they were nice and the restaurant is very clean. 

Overall: I took off a star because some of their broths could use more seasoning. I've only tried the rib eye beef pot, seafood & tofu pot, and Japanese miso pot. My friends and family have tried the others and they can be rather bland. All the pots are $11.99 each with exception of the lobster pot that is $19.99. It's on the pricer side in my opinion because the vegetables used are cheap and there are not enough meat in the pot to justify for $11.99. I recommend to try this place if you're new to eating hot pot or just want a small meal (and spend $7 more at an AYCE hot pot place for a real hot pot experience)."}
{"text":"Bomb! Amazing customer service! My first time trying it and i loved it! Tried the pork and clam pot and it was yummy! Will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go if you're craving soup other than the usual pho or ramen. I ordered the Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken and Korean Kimchi Pot (2) Medium Spicy...was not disappointed. Although it cost about $13 a pot, they give you a pretty good amount of food. 

I would've given them 5 stars, but I disliked the Pig Blood Cake in my soup and the staff never refilled my drink."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends. They liked it and I like it. Pretty cool vibe and service is fast. A lot of parking in the plaza. Tried the milk tea with boba and I'd say it's comparable to some of the other great boba places in town."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great customer service. I had Kevin and Connie as my waiters and they were really friendly and always attended to my needs promptly and efficiently. The food was out of this world, I fell in love with the chicken wings appetizer and the sweet potato fries. As for the stinky tofu...well lets just say it lives up to its name, not that bad of a flavour though just pretty bland. The sweet chili sauce paired perfectly with the chicken wings. The hot pot looked great and delicious, although the broth was pretty plain. I ordered the seafood hot pot and its a fairly big bowl. We shared the bowl amongst four people and still had leftovers. We finished off with a salted caramel ice cream dessert and it wasn't all that grand. If you ever happen to stop by Pot Tea I recommend trying the chicken wings, they're spectacular!"}
{"text":"Not a very good experience. The meat used for fried chicken are likely stale. Didn't like the beverage either. And it took a little long for the food to be served."}
{"text":"My wife and I met with some friends here. Upon entering the staff were very friendly. It wasn't crowded at all for a Thursday evening dinner crowd. We were seated quickly and the staff were very pleasant and attentive. As for the food, I could say that it could be better. My
Wife and I shared a Thai pot and I thought it was bland. Later I find out that everyone thought that their orders were bland. This isn't to say that it tasted horrible
Or anything. It just wasn't anything to write home about. The popcorn chicken looked great on the menu but I didn't get a chance to try it. That would probably the only reason for us to come back."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 10+ people less than an hour before closing. We were a large, rowdy group with over half of us trying this place out for the first time! So it was pretty much expected that we were going to be there past their closing time. To our delight, the lady (who's either the owner or the manager) was nothing but nice to us! She stopped by our table to answer any of our questions and offer suggestions. As we were leaving, she caught up with us and escorted our huge group out the restaurant.

They have a very diverse menu, with plenty of options! You also choose the level of spiciness for your own hot pot. In addition to the hot pot, you get the option of either plain rice, minced pork over rice, or vermicelli as a side. The minced pork over rice and vermicelli are probably your best bets (plus they're worth more). I ordered the Rib Eye Beef Pot with vermicelli and it was delicious! The tofu and the fish balls were my faveees. There was a decent amount of beef but it could use a bit more vegetables. The broth was pretty good and yes, you can ask for a soup refill!

Coming from SoCal, I was spoiled with having Boiling Point (which is very similar to Pot Tea) so it's hard NOT to compare. Ingredients-wise, I would say Pot Tea has a larger variety in each pot but Boiling Pot in general is more flavorful. But while in Vegas, Pot Tea is highly recommended! Great service and pretty good food!"}
{"text":"I came, i ate, and i will be back. 

I came in on a weekday afternoon for lunch because i was under the weather and soup sounded good. The hostest/waitress was nice, attentive and helpful. We ordered the Seafood pot which to my surprised wasnt lacking in terms of content for the price of $12.99 being enough for 2 people without doubt. The waitress kindly offered multiple times to continue to add additional broth to our pot which i was pleased about. I cant say the broth is the most flavorful as others have said but thats why you get the sauce on the side to add to taste just like making a broth at home. I prefer it this way as everyone is different with their spice levels and the kitchen cat make it spot on for everybody. Another nice surprise was the lunch special with the free green/black tea between 11-2 on weekdays i think, i didnt take advantage of it this time around but ill surely try that next time. I will be back and i think if your in the mood for soup broth you should give it a look too. Will it knock your socks off with flavor? No but for $12.99 for a two person meal with seafood its a solid go to option in the Southwest from what i can see."}
{"text":"My family and I love coming here. It's a great place for a large group because two hot pots can be shared with a group of 5, unless you're my family and order 3 hehe. 
The staff here are also super attentive and friendly. Both times that I've been here, they were so helpful in answering our questions.  

As for the hot pots, they have plenty of options for everyone! Whether you are a vegetarian, pescatarian, or a hearty meat eater - there is something for you here. They also fill the pots up until they're about to spill and tip over. Score! If you're also running low on broth, they come up and refill the pots with no extra cost. Double score! 

Appetizers here are a hit. My family loves their popcorn chicken and minced meat with rice bowl."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a large group to share a meal! They have a pretty good variety of hot pot to choose from as well as appetizers.  We ordered some popcorn chicken with basil and chicken wings served with chili sweet sauce.  The rib eye hot pot was served with some corn, tomatoes, carrots, daikon, fish cakes, quail eggs, enoki mushrooms, and cilantro. The broth was very flavorful with a little bit of kick to it."}
{"text":"Much better second time around. Girlfriend and I decided to give this place a second try since the first time we didn't even get to eat because for some reason it smelled so bad when we walked in..

Food and drinks are delicious. I had the Seafood&Tofu soup (very spicy for myself) along with a lychee green tea. I just moved to Vegas not too long ago and this is as close to Boiling Point (in California) as I could get. Service was great. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This place is so good.  Just have to try it once. The service is so good. Great place."}
{"text":"Update review as of 8/24/2014

I've been a regular at this restaurant, until today, I don't know if I'll ever go back....first of all, they changed their menu, all the hot pots are all increased with no improvement, so instead of $11.99, then $12.99, and now $13.99, they took away the lotus root that I really like, meat quality was downgraded significantly, it has so much weird looking fat on it I cannot even chew(actually I don't even think it's fat, it looks like the cow has cancer or whatever worst part of meat you can think of) also, the free drink is now offered only Monday through Friday, not during weekend.  I got some pop corn chicken, it's literally 90% batter and ONLY 10% chicken meat, for $5.99, I'd say it's pretty darn expensive and totally not worth it, it seems they offered you such good deal up front, but now they are slowly taking away things, if they think they can fool the loyal customers like this they are totally wrong, I'm really disappointed about the whole thing and will not come back.


Reivew from about 6 month ago

I went there twice already and really enjoyed the whole experience, owner Wendy is super friendly and sweet, to me, service is the most important thing, I like their pop corn chicken a lot, very juicy inside,  however, I wish they could change the name to \"salt-and-pepper chicken\" or \"Crunchy salt-and-pepper chicken\", so people who are new to it won't think it's the same as KFC pop corn chicken.  fried basil is a great touch!  I like the hot pot so far, but I wish the \"super spicy\" level could be a bit more spicier, but I know they want to play safe, I also wish there's more sauce option, such as garlic, chopped green onion, and wish they used the most popular Taiwanese BBQ sauce instead of generic brand(yes I can tell the difference).  They have a lot of ingredients in hot pot and I really like it, you feel what you paid is worth it with drink and rice, and an order of pop corn chicken and a pot is actually just enough for 2(you can always have extra side order)

Another thing I wish they could improve(hey I know I complained a lot, but that means I care and want them to be better!), I wish they could change the dining ware from cheap plastic to ceramic bowl, plastic will actually release harmful chemical upon touching hot temperature that is known to cause cancer, and we are talking about boiling hot pot here........might be urban legend, but why risk it, I do like it they use stainless steel chopstick though! By the way, it's cash only, but it's good because it makes me think more carefully not to order too many thing! would be awesome if they take credit card though!  Don't expect the quality to be like from back home, but it's good considering I'm so far away from home and yup, I will definitely come back!
:)"}
{"text":"Sooo good. Rly friendly service and delicious pots. Taiwanese pot was my fave with instant ramen. Would definitely recommend the minced pork rice and popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. This area is turning into Chinatown 2.0! Popcorn chicken, mmm! You gotta start your meal off here with that. Mix the soy and chili oil for a nice dipping sauce, or ask for some sweet chili sauce instead. All the hot pots I've had have been good,  but the lamb has been my favorite.  You have the option of regular or minced pork rice with your meal. Definitely get the minced pork!"}
{"text":"I love coming here with my mom friends for lunch especially on little chilly day. They offer authentic Taiwanese hot pot and they tastes yummy!!! You can adjust spicy level or even non-spicy so no worries if you aren't good with spicy food. You can get lots of veggies without knowing too."}
{"text":"While I disagree with my sidekick about the portion size, I really thought this was a great portion sized hot pot and taste.  She mentioned when the business started it was $10 and increased steadily.  She also mentioned the photos blew up portions, so I had to ask her:  Did you eat all your hot pot?  No, was the answer and she even took it home, so I think portion is fine.  Taste was great, I had the seafood and she had the beef.  Mine came with plump mussels, shrimp, crab, etc...  I picked the extra extra spicy but it seems the habaneros were hotter than this, it's fine with me I like spice.  I love the mala mix in the soup and I requested vermicelli with the hot pot, overall it is no chubby cattle but it taste and cost less without the conveyor belt."}
{"text":"From the name (and from the outside, even the inside) Pot Tea Social House seems like just a cafe. Don't be fooled, this is a restaurant, not just a tea house. 
Order the hot pot and minced pork rice for your side. The hot pots here are better than any of the ones I've had in Vegas. They are stuffed full of seafood, meat, veggies and you will be STUFFED when you leave. 
Ask the staff to shut off your hot pot ~5 minutes after it's served. You want your food to sit in the heat a little, but attempting to eat it while it's still boiling will give you a burnt tongue. 
They don't serve alcohol! Restaurant is extremely clean."}
{"text":"Went there late on a Monday night, staff was very courteous. They offered to refill our pot with broth if we ran low, which was nice. Definitely get some appetizers and the side of minced pork over rice. One pot is enough to feed two people I'd say. Good experience overall. To answer someone else's comment from an earlier post, they do take credit card. However I did not see any sign on their door saying so."}
{"text":"Came here and ordered the rib eye pot. I got it with mild spice. the spice level was perfect I was scared they would make it too spicy if I ordered mild but it was just right. The rice with pork was delicious! Definitely recommend getting it instead of plain rice. I kind of feel like this place is a little over price than the other hot pots places I been to. Other than that the food is great."}
{"text":"Fantastic addition to the neighborhood.  Restaurant is clean, decor is trendy.  Staff was very friendly.

1 pot order is plenty, might be good for two.  Broth was extremely hot, and you can request to have the flame turned off.

Cons are that service seemed a little slow, and the broth needed a tad more flavor.  They're kinda new so I'll give them a pass.  Hope it improves slightly, but it's not to get mad about."}
{"text":"This review is based off of one visit. Due to my first experience I unfortunately I won't be giving this place another try. 

My boyfriend and I got the rib eye hotpot (which was suggested as their most popular hotpot) and the Taiwanese popcorn chicken plate. The chicken plate was a lot more measly than expected. Chicken was good but not a fabulous chicken to rice ratio.

What disappointed me most was the rib eye hotpot. Looked delicious and boiling hot when brought out. First of all there was no rib eye, but rather brisket. We were given non spicy when mild was ordered, although the waiter was very accommodating in bringing out extra spices for us to add to our liking. Never order the hot pot not spicy. It was the most flavorless soup ever. Tasted like water flavored by what was added into our soup (brisket, corn, imitation crab, squid, vegetables). VERY Minute amount of flavor even when we dumped in a whole bowl full of spiced oil and peppers. This lack of flavor was a huge turn off for me. 

Service was exemplary though.. So a star for that!

TLDR: hotpot lacked flavor. Was not tasty enough to try again any time soon. Good service."}
{"text":"This was my second official Hot Pot experience and so far I'm a fan of the hot pot concept!

Pot Tea Social House is quaint in size and has a simple two sided menu - one side features apps, teas, and desserts and the other has a listing of different Taiwanese hot pots. 

I went with one of my girlfriends and we started off with chicken wings and both ordered individual Seafood and Tofu Hot Pots. With each hot pot order comes your choice of white rice, white rice with minced pork, or noodles. I just got white rice and my friend got the white rice with minced pork. 

- Chicken Wings 
Wings are ginormous in size and seasoned with salt/pepper. Came with a side of a sweet and sour dipping sauce. I thought the wings tasted great and didn't need any sauce 

- Seafood and Tofu Hot Pot
I ordered my hot pot extra spicy! It came out piping hot and of course with a flame underneath. The soup included a variety of seafood (fish, crab, mussels, shrimp, squid, clam, etc), tofu, and a variety of veggies (corn, napa cabbage, etc). I really enjoyed the heat and flavor of the broth. There was also a decent amount of seafood so I left very full! 

No complaints with the service - food came out at a decent pace and servers came by to check on us and offered additional broth. Enjoyable experience overall and hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Coming from Southern Cali and I know there are a lot of hot pot places there, I can says this place was great and service was excellent.  Wendy the owner was very attentive and friendly and so was all the other waitresses.  I definitely will go back and bring my family and friends.  Thank you for an awesome evening Wendy!"}

Their hot pot is delicious, 

You should come here soon!

Yelp doesn't like my haiku. So now I must write some more. 
It was good. Apparently it is always empty. I drove a long way."}
{"text":"It was our first time here so we just got what a lot of Yelpers were raving about & I definitely wasn't disappointed. 

When we went in, it was completely empty so we got to choose our table. Our server's name was Connie whom was literally the sweetest ever (try to get her if you want a good experience)! She was really nice, constantly checked up on us, asking if we needed more water in our cups or broth in our pots. 

We got chicken wings to start off (mainly for my picky little brother) & he really liked it. My boyfriend got the medium spicy ribeye pot while my cousin & I shared the mild Japanese miso pot. All four of us got the minced pork rice to go on the side. We also got two milk teas, strawberry green tea, & mango green tea all with boba which we thought was so good! The drinks were perfectly sweet & the boba had great texture. 

As for the pots, my boyfriend said his was good but needed a bit more flavor & spice while my cousin & I thought ours was fine the way it was. 

Overview: good food, good drinks, good service, decent prices, definitely would come back & recommend to family & friends."}

{"text":"Love this place!!!!

After a hike and before the movies, we wanted to eat somewhere good, cheap, and somewhere that fulfilled my craving.  I wanted kimchi and soup so this was recommended by my sister.  We came here around 430pm on a Sunday, we were the only ones there (party of 4).  

The server took our drink orders and we got mango green tea & wintermelon. I had the mango tea with lychee jelly and it was good.  We also ordered popcorn chicken and wings for our starters.  The food did not take long at all.  Maybe around 10 minutes or less which is a decent time.  We ordered our soups.  The kimchi soup medium spicy, and seafood soup.  We shared because the pots are pretty big. The soups come with either vermicelli, minced pork and rice, or rice.  We got pork and rice which was so DELICIOUS!!!!!! The kimchi soup was pretty good.  It contained various seafoods and I believe it was sliced beef & of course the kimchi.  The seafood pot had all kinds of seafood from clams, mussels, crab, fishcake, etc.  Both soups tasted great.  Now the popcorn chicken was my second favorite next to the pork rice.  So yummy and crispy!!! The wings were good and cooked perfectly. Very juicy and crispy.  

I am actually craving the popcorn chicken as i type this out.  I spent only $60 on everything which is pretty decent. Apps were $6 and pots were $13 i think? But great deal, great location, and great food!!!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! We went few weeks ago when they just barley opened so they were a bit on the new/slow side of customers service on the food, but the waitress were all wonderful and so kind. The food was a lot for one person (atleast I think so!) and I loved how they came around and asked if we needed to get \"refill\" or want more broth. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Almost a FIVE. Nice selection of 11 different types of Hot Pots including one that is served with a 1 lb lobster ($19.95). Had the credit card machine been working last night, we would've tried it. We ordered the Pork & Clam pot, one pot with stinky tofu (name escapes me), and popcorn chicken. The broth from the Pork & Clam was our favorite. 

As for the popcorn chicken, I'd say it is so-so. Doesn't taste exactly like the one from Ay-Chung, other Taiwanese eateries in LA, or the food stands on the streets of Taipei.

One criticism I have is the lack of dipping sauces. Pot Tea only has 2: Sacha & Ponzu. Come on.....it's a hot pot place. You need more than 2 dipping sauces! Also, please provide chopped green onions and cilantro, too! On the other hand, they must be commended for offering minced pork over rice as one of your carb choices with no extra charge. Nice touch.

The one thing that is a FIVE is the service. The staff is very attentive and polite with them constantly checking on us."}
{"text":"First time here and absolutely loved. The chicken wings with sweet chili were delicious. Even better was the seafood bowl. The broth was tasty and spicy and the seafood was fresh.  Great service too.  Will be back many times."}
{"text":"I was sad to see New Day Cafe gone, since it was one of my favorite breakfast joints. I was intrigued by Pot Tea Social House.  I finally tried this place for the first time, and wow...loved it!!!! Friendly and helpful staff. Refreshing fruit n milk teas, and good hearty \"hot pot\" soups!! Seafood, vegetarian, and beef varieties. One pot feeds two!! Very reasonable and nice decor.  Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Love the restaurant! The servers are nice and food quality it's excellent! It kind of makes you feel you  are back in Taiwan!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff good services!
Food is good but it's very spicy. I recommend getting mild if it's not spicy enough they will bring you some more soup."}
{"text":"I used to go here really often when it first open until I move. Pot tea has the best soup and tea ever. I love their miso soup I think it comes with seafood and stuff. 
Their sausage also taste amazing, I've never like any sausage in this world but Thai sausage since I'm Thai but Taiwanese sausage has this weird taste that wants me to keeps eating it over and over again. For drink I recommend their lychee green tea. It's amazing as well the tea and lychee goes together pretty but still one of the best tea ever. However I do not recommended boba since they're not like other boba place so not a lot of people order boba so I understand that they have to froze the boba and reuse it the next day so it's not recommended but overall it's perfect and would totally go back again"}
{"text":"Me & my friend were really hungry. We both decided to eat here since we've never tried this restaurant out. I ordered the spicy beef bowl while my friend had the Japanese miso bowl. We ordered to have it medium spicy, but it was a little too spicy to the point where our noses were running & my friend's face started sweating, BUT it was definitely worth it! For an appetizer we ordered the Taiwanese popcorn chicken. For drinks, I had the lychee black tea w/ boba which was really yummy & my friend had the mango tea. The service was great as well! This restaurant is now one of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered the ribeye hot pot. Parents ordered the seafood hot pot and we had the popcorn chicken for everyone. All dishes were delicious and the popcorn chicken was simply amazing. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Meeeehh when it comes to hot pot and Taiwanese food in general Vegas is really lacking. I came here on a Sunday evening and there was about 3 other tables seated. Service was quick the restaurant was cute and clean which is really important to me. 

I ordered the rib-eye hot pot and was pretty disappointed. The broth was basically tasteless which is very unusual for hot pot soup. My boyfriend ordered the kimchee pot and it was basically the same taste as tofu soup. I ordered medium spicy he ordered mild and his was spicier than mine. 

Traditionally hot pot is served with a verity of dipping sauces. This place didn't have any that I seen maybe I needed to ask? Not too sure. The highlight for me was the minced pork rice. And that's pretty hard to mess up lol. I'd probably come back but order the Taiwanese pot next time in hopes it has better flavor."}
{"text":"If you're thinking about coming, no need to think further & just drive down here. This place is really the best. 

The hotpots are yummy with good broth & good veggies, meats, etc. I think this place would be good for winter since it's very hot when the pot comes out & a lot of steam is everywhere. 

The service is on point tho ! All the servers are super nice. Manager/owner Wendy is the sweetest. I haven't had like a lot of conversations with her but little things she says is really sweet & nice. 

Good food, good service - 5 stars.
Come & try yourself :)"}
{"text":"Dynamite hot pot and sausage. Durian ice cream to die for, gem of a find, if you can find it :-)"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Awesome service. The popcorn chicken is a must to try. It's been close to 20 yrs since I tried stinky tofu, tried it at Pot Tea, wasn't disappointed. Going to bring some friends here next time. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Food was good. Price wasn't worth the portion size. You pay the same price for most of the pots. Veggie pot barely had any vegetables in it. My brother and dad had beef and seafood pots, they had a decent amount of food. The vegetable pot, not so much. There was one waiter working majority of the time, poor guy. Cute atmosphere, cute decor, can't see myself coming back though. I feel like I had an appetizer and now I'm ready for my meal."}
{"text":"I got the Kimchi hot pot. Lots of flavor and a lot of meat/seafood. It was kind of overwhelming, but delicious! I got the mild spicy-ness level, but it felt more like medium. Also the Taiwanese popcorn chicken is a must try! The boba milk teas are pretty good too, especially the winter melon green tea!"}
{"text":"My pregnant friend loves hot pot. She invited me to join her for dinner, so I went and tried Pot Tea Social! 

We were seated right away, and the place is clean! I ordered the miso broth with seafood, rice with minced pork and sweetened mango black tea (no boba that night). Their servings were huge, seafood and veggies were fresh, but the broth lacked a ton of flavor. I tried to put some of their sauces but it didnt make up for it."}
{"text":"OK, i do. i really do love hot pot. especially taiwanese hot pot, is what i crave for the most. i come here mostly for the taiwanese spicy pot- some days i crave for it so much that i come alone. the ladies that work here know me now, which is pretty funny. i've collected many free pots off of their stamp cards if that emphasizes how often i dine here. this is comparable to boiling point in LA as everything is cooked and ready to eat in the pot. i'm literally stuffed every time i come out of this restaurant but it's okay because i'm so satisfied. the ambience is nice, the music can be a little loud at times but nothing that can't be fixed. i highly recommend pot tea if you're in the mood for a delicious hot pot meal!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place and come here very often. Overall the food is great and cheap, and the service is good. My favorites are the Taiwanese sausage and the seafood hot pot. But the last time I was there with a friend we both got food poisoning so I doubt we will return any time soon. A little bit disappointed now."}
{"text":"Pot tea social house is not your typical Taiwanese hot pot/cuisine. It's way better,we had the popcorn chicken and the spicy beef hot pot good enough. To share for 2people.service was great,restaurant Was very clean and the owner bought us dessert #winning.come and check this gem in the southwest out."}
{"text":"Once I graduated from college in SoCal, I came back home to Vegas and I had been craving a good Taiwanese hot pot meal for a while. I didn't think I would find something that could compare to SoCal's quality, but after finding Pot Tea Social House, I realized that I was definitely mistaken.

The servers are friendly, and they always come by and check up on you and your hot pot. You can get your fire turned off after a while, but I love piping hot food, so I always let mine burn until it's gone. They even offer extra broth at no charge!

The popcorn chicken is amazing, as Taiwanese popcorn chicken tends to be, and the milk tea is nothing to scoff at either. As for the hot pots, they're all very good. You might have to do a little bit of experimenting to figure out which one you like the best, but they all offer a unique flavor and a wide variety of ingredients. My two favorites are the Pickled Mustard Lamb hot pot and the Miso hot pot.

Overall, if you're looking for a great hot pot experience (or you just really like good popcorn chicken, as one of my friends always orders the popcorn chicken meal), then Pot Tea Social House is right up your alley."}
{"text":"So this is a good place if you like soups fully loaded...it was good and flavorful...and you dont have to have everything in the bowl  that it was supposed to come with..... so get creative and enjoy ..

Since I wasn't in the mood to eat soup though, i decided to order the Taiwanese chicken ...it was good... I would wanted an option for some heat(spice) or dipping sauce. when i got the platter, it came with Rice and KiMChee but it still was good.  There indeed though was a lot of food.  

Again i gave it only 3 stars because the staff could have been a little more quicker on cleaning up the dirty dishes.  It wasnt busy and maybe there were trying to \"not\" bother us becuase there was about 8 of us, but there was no room on the table and so we were stacking dishes.  My mother-in-law had to tell the waitress to please take some of the dishes.

Other than that, it was fine."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place as I love Hotpot. I convinced my brother to go with me after seeing someone's (now outdated) photo of the price only $11.99. When we arrived at 8pm on a Saturday it was completely empty. That made me worry a little lol. 
After looking at the menu I noticed the price was now $13.99 but oh well.. I was already there. 
We ordered one Ribeye Hotpot and one miso.
For sides, minced pork rice which was really good and some vermicelli Noodles. 
The Ribeye broth had very little flavor,  while the miso broth was really good.  
We also got an extra order of taro and Ribeye for $3 and $4. I though it was kind of strange how the meat was already cooked. That means you're re heating the meat in your  soup and most likely it will come out over cooked.. 
The taro being pre boiled was convenient though since you don't have to wait too long for it to soften.  This place is decent but I prefer Chinese style Hotpot where you pick and cook your own meats and veggies. Also,  after spending about $20 a person with very little meat and veggies of my choice it didn't seem worth it."}
{"text":"I have to say, I wasn't all that impressed by the hotpot here.  Compared to boiling pt or jackpot in LA, flavor wise falls really short. I ordered the medium spicy seafood and tofu. Major downside, it wasn't spicy period so it was really bland. Probably next time I'll try spicy, to see if there's a difference.  However I do like the amount and variety of seafood they put into the hotpot. There's crab,  mussels,  clams, scallops, fish, shrimp, squid. My favorite part of the whole dish was the tofu actually.  Don't know why,  but it tastes really good dipped in their soy sauce chili paste mixture.  Which is another downside, their dipping sauce is nothing special, its the same sauce you would eat with dim sum. They don't have a signature garlic sauce like boiling pt or jackpots. 

The rice with minced pork was very tasty and is probably the true seller here. My sister ordered that while I ordered the vermicelli, which wasn't very good. The noodles were kinda hard even when dumped into the hotpot to cook further.  

Overall service was good, our server came by and explained everything on the menu and pointed out their popular dishes. She was super attentive and poured me more broth when it was getting too low. I really appreciate that. I would come back again to try the other hotpots. They are located super close to my house,  so it's very convenient.  Oh and they do offer a stamp card, collect 10 and you get a hotpot free,  which is pretty cool hehe."}
{"text":"Yay, love hotpot places!! Even better, stinky tofu!!

Came to Vegas for work so it's relatively close to the strip if you get a craving for something more authentic. It's located in a plaza with other stores so parking should be relatively easy. 

Ordered the wings along with deep fried stinky tofu, and then got the stinky tofu hotpot. The stinky tofu was delicious despite the name haha. The restaurant itself is relatively small and very clean and when we went it was empty (but we did go at like 5 because we had a flight to catch later). The wings were delicious, not too oily but flavorful. And the stinky tofu-also delicious! The hotpots range in prices and you can choose your own level of spiciness (0-3). You also get to choose from either a side of rice or vermicelli."}
{"text":"I've been here twice already and every time I've eaten here it was always a great experience! For some reason I forget to check in here because im so caught up at looking at everyone making their hot pots! 

I highly suggest ordering the Taiwanese popcorn chicken too! I'm addicted to those. Crispy, flavorful kick! 

So, when you receive your hot pot, you gewt your own individual box with the flame going under the pot. It keeps going on for awhile and eventually dies out. If its too hot, they can turn the flame off for you. :) 

I've tried the Rib Eye Hot pot and the Pork and Clam pot. Both Excellent! If you are hooked, don't forget to ask for a stamp card! I really love that they have that. haha."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant serving Taiwanese food. Highly recommend the Japanese Miso hot pot if you like seafood. All hot pots come with a either vermicelli, steamed rice or rice with minced pork. I recommend the rice with minced pork. Service was spot on and food was prompt. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm a major pot lover...the hot pot kind! 

So when Pot Tea Social House popped up, I was super excited to check it out.  It took over the New Day Café, so it was interesting to see what they did with this casual breakfast joint.  I was pleasantly surprised with how they changed the look and feel of the place.

The menu is very detailed, which makes it easy for those new to the hot pot world.  You know what you're getting upfront, so no random things in your soup show up.

The Husband and I chose to share one pot:

#9 Sour Pickled Mustard & Lamb Pot \"Sliced Lamb, Sour Pickled Mustard, Daikon, Tofu, Carrot, Fish Ball, Fish Fillet, Lotus Root, Cuttlefish Ball\" ($11.99) with the waiter-recommended Minced Pork Rice (other choices are Steamed Rice or Vermicelli).  When the hot pot arrived, it looked great!  However, as we dove further in, we noticed not too much pickled mustard in the soup.  What's the point of calling it Sour Pickled Mustard & Lamb Pot if there's not much of the main ingredient present?  The server came by to shut off the fire and didn't really hear me when I suggested lowering it instead.  (Or perhaps lowering it wasn't an option?)  As a result, our soup got cold quickly.  Therefore, you don't really want to drink the broth when you're done.  The accompanying Minced Pork Rice was a really small portion and it would cost $2 more for another bowl.  We chose the medium spice level, and it wasn't too spicy.  

We also ordered the Taiwanese Pork Hocks Stew ($5.99).  Biggest mistake ever.  They were the driest and toughest ham hocks I have ever had.  The term 'stew' is misleading because it's not tender at all! I could barely pull any edible bits off and I needed some major flossing when I was done attempting to extract some meat off those things.

Another appetizer we tried was their Fried Stinky Tofu ($5.99).  Average, not really stinky or memorable.  I should mention Sweet Potato Fries ($5.99) were also on the menu - totally random in my opinion.  And I looked around, and not many people finished their order of it.

Overall, Pot Tea Social House was an okay food experience.  I guess I would go back again if I was too lazy to drive down to Spring Mountain.

Side note: They do have a loyalty stamp card.  Buy 10 hot pots, get 1 free."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place. Finally came over today to check it out. Everyone so friendly and warm. The pot was in the special made container. We ordered fried chicken, sticky fried tofu and spicy tofu pot. The pot was full of items and they got us both the stew pork rice and vermicelli noodle. The taste reminds me of Taiwan! Yes! We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"It was windy and cold; I wanted something hot; and Pot Tea seemed like a good idea.  Pot Tea is one of the few authentic Taiwanese food joints in the Southwest (and really Las Vegas overall).  Their signature item(s) is the hotpot, which is essentially a selection of protein and preset veggies put cooked in an individual pot in front of you.  

We went at noon on a Wednesday and the store was completely empty.  For some reason, the store reeked of sewer....though it was a wave of nostalgia of the Taipei night markets.  I ordered their $13 ribeye hotpot, which came with the broth, ribeye, and veggies in the individual pot and a choice of white or minced pork rice.  I found the broth to be plain and probably only 5 thin slices of meat inside the soup.  The rest of the soup was veggies.  The minced pork rice was delicious, except there want enough minced pork to go with the entire bowl of rice.  

The -2 stars is for the small portion size and a stomach ache right after the meal."}
{"text":"I'm from LA so I couldn't help but compare with Boiling Point in the 626 when I came here. Pot Tea was good and cheap but I think I like BP better. We arrived a little before 5pm on Saturday (12/27/14) and it was empty! I was scared because I chose this location for my boyfriend's family to try since I love hot pot. They ended up enjoying it so yay! Unlike BP's hour wait, we had no wait here. Perfect. A lot more people arrived after us and the place began to fill up. 

FOOD:
My bf and I had the ($20) Lobster Hot Pot. It was good. The shells were pre-cracked so it was easy to open (I think). He didn't let me open it. We got minced pork rice with it, but I wish all the pots came with noodles already like BP. He can't handle spicy, so they gave me a spicy soup base on the side. Nice! So I adjusted the spiciness in my bowl to my liking. Unless you're really hungry, one pot is good enough to share between two people. They refill your broth if you need it. 

His parents has the rib-eye hot pot and they seemed to enjoy it. Price is actually a bit cheaper than BP. Popcorn chicken was yummy. Needed a dipping sauce though. 

SAUCE:
The two sauces are a Ponzu sauce and a chili bean paste(?) sauce. They were good but I like BP's side sauces better. 

TEA: 
SO GOOD! I'm spoiled by LA's tea shops, but I enjoyed this. I got the lychee black tea and it was delicious. I believe the waitress said their tea were imported from Taiwan(?). BF got mango green tea and it was yummy but I liked my choice better. His dad got a tea latte and it looked really good. Wish I got to try it!

SERVICE:
Service was wonderful. Since we were first and it was less crowded, service was very attentive and nice. The waiter and waitress were really helpful since it was our first time there. She explained things thoroughly and said we could sub things in our hot pot if we wanted, which is something you can't do at BP! The Filipino waiter said something to me in Tagalog (possibly thank you) because I guess I blended in with my bf's family haha. He was very polite to my bf's parents. Basically, they were great! 

It was a different experience from LA's Boiling Point; I enjoyed it. Loved the no wait!! Like the other reviewer said, they're both different and they're both good. And don't forget a stamp card if you're a Vegas local!"}
{"text":"I'm from la so I love my hot pot from boiling point and jazzcat. This is more in the style of boiling point because everything is in the pot ready to go. The waitress was super young so she forgot a lot of things and we had to ask for things twice but she was very nice.... Just forgetful??

Each pot is 12.99. And they actually had a variety of flavors. I'm surprised but they had stinky tofu, spicy Taiwanese, seafood, veggie, beef, pork etc. it also comes with vermicelli, plain rice or minced pork rice. The mince pork rice was a bonus for me because it was really yummy. I normally order vermicelli but at this place I'll always order the rice. 

I got the beef pot. The portion size was good. With good portion of meat, cabbage, Fish cake, corn, tomato, enoki mushroom and tofu. It also had preserved pickled veggies in it that gives the broth a different flavor. The soup was not too flavorful. It doesn't have that beef or pork bone flavor that boiling point has. It's lighter actually. However, the more I ate it the more I like it.

Their pork blood cake was mushy and had more rice than anything... I like that better because I don't really like the taste of pork blood. 

If this was in LA I would give it 2 maybe 3 stars but it's the only one I know of in vegas so far. So I'll definitely come back because it hit the spot. But I've  had better. :("}
{"text":"Our first time checking this place out for lunch today. The place was clean. Nice and casual ambiance. The staff were all very friendly and super attentive to us. We got a couple of hot pots and plates. Everything tasted very good! I appreciated how fast the food came and they gave us my rice with pork (which was sooo yummy) before all the other food so my one year old daughter can start eating. They also gave us a large appetizer plate of chicken wings for free for checking them out for the first time. It was a great experience. Coming from suburban Chicago, we have checked out a few restaurants here in Vegas that got good Yelp! reviews but were still disappointed by either the service or the food. But would definitely come back and recommend this place to friends and relatives!"}
{"text":"Maya was excellent.  SHAVED ICE is sooooo good!! My husband and I shared it because it was humongous. We got strawberries with the salted caramel ice cream. It was great."}
{"text":"First time eating here and my husband and I ordered the rib eye (non-spicy) hot pot. We didn't know how big the hot pot would be so we decided to just share and order two appetizers and side of minced pork rice (which was delicious!) 

When it comes to portion, I'd say only two people can share the appetizer and they were pricey in my opinion. We ordered taiwanese popcorn chicken hoping it would taste the same as 'Kara Age' a japanese crispy chicken but to our disappointment, it tasted nothing special. The chicken wings were good though! 

The rib eye hot pot was flavorless and I'm glad we did not order two of them. I won't be coming back again just because the food did not meet my expectations and were a bit pricey for the size. 

3 stars because the place was very clean and the servers are nice and attentive."}
{"text":"A great hang out spot on the southwest side of town! Very friendly n the food is tasty. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you're seeking an authentic hot pot experience, go somewhere else - you'll be bummed you did not get to play table chef.  But, if you're willing to put authenticity aside and just want a good meal, decently healthy (I'm talking the soup, not the fried chicken) and fresh ingredients, Pot Tea is a solid choice.

There's plenty of parking, the restaurant is really clean and modern, and the service is terrific."}
{"text":"Food here is decent. Prices are okay as well. The owner, she's very nice and attentive. The service, on the other hand, is a joke. First server didn't know what room temperature water was. Second server we asked forgot. Also the hot pot we ordered came out without the fire underneath lit. If my wife didn't love hot pot so much i would've never gone there. She will probably still go but tonight was the last time for me."}
{"text":"Personal size hot pot. Starts at $12.99. Japanese Miso was delicious. I got medium spice and it was pretty spicy.  I liked it though.  We had to ask server to put our fire out so soup could cool down for us to eat. Complimentary green tea with meal :) Next best thing to Pho on a cold day! Would definitely come back:)"}
{"text":"This place is alright for some hot soup to warm you up on a cold day. Place is small and it wasn't all that busy for a Saturday night. The \"hot pots\" were enough to fill an individual. We had the kimch, prime rib, and hot spicy thai flavors. Out of all three the spicy thai pot was the best with the kimch pot coming in second. The prime rib was a bit bland to my liking. Prices were cheap and I spent a total of 15 bucks just for me. Check this place out if you are in the area. 3 stars for a good place."}
{"text":"If you are wanting soup, then this is where you have to go. Their Taiwanese hotspots are so flavorful and their service is excellent as well. Most, if not all their hotspots has seafood in it, so of you are allergic to seafood I would just double check and ask what's in it.  I always get their hotspots with the minced pork rice. Yum-o! And the miso hotpot is one of my new favs. They also have a great variety of hot teas that are delicious. And the hotpots are great for sharing too. Its a lot of food for a great low price. They start at $12.99 I believe. Love it here. Its one of my regular spots in the southwest now."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome waiter/waitress.  Definitely a must try place if you crave for  mini hot pot while in town."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for people that love hot foods. I liked the way it was cooked and the presentation was cute. The fire burned a little more than I would have wanted, but the problem was easily solved by the workers putting out the fire. 

I ordered the lobster hot pot in mild spice and it was really good. The lobster didn't have much flavoring inside, but it balanced well with the pork broth added. The lobster took up most of the space, but it is perfect for lobster lovers!

Next, I ordered the Japanese Miso pot in medium spice. It was tad bit spicy, but it was delicious. It becomes more spicy when it is boiling, so you can turn off the fire to make it less spicy. 

The service was nice and very friendly. I also got a stamp card! In addition, the pricing is good and on the cheap side. 

I would ask that they improve on the rice quality. Maybe a bit softer, I suggest. 

They have been open for three months now and I wish them much success in the future!"}
{"text":"First time here and everything is horrible. Got the green milk tea with boba and it's all watered down with hard boba. Popcorn chicken was all battered. There was really no meat inside. Fried chicken wings has no taste and the sweet potato fries was horrible. Never coming Back here again! We couldn't eat anything!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I really enjoyed myself.  I am looking forward to coming back.  The staff was as great as the food!"}
{"text":"The people were nice..but the place smelled weird. We tried their fresh watermelon juice with tapioca...it was so refreshing! Did not eat there because it was too Hot outside to eat Hotpot."}
{"text":"One of my favorite because of the sweet staff members. They are a bit slow when it's busy but otherwise they are very attentive. The soup is a bit bland but they have good soy sauce to add for more flavoring. I love all of the different individual hot pot types and flavors. My favorite is the spicy beef. Overall a friendly and great dining experience every time."}
{"text":"Coming from LA where there's hot pot places a plenty this place is pretty damn good. Most definitely up to par with some of the places back home like boiling point. The flavors were really good and the portion size was satisfying. I had the popcorn chicken too and that one was only aight. But hey can't have everything. It was still good enough to order again. Their drinks were exceptional and their service is really what makes this my new go to spot for hot pot. The restaurant is super clean too which is slightly different then the ones back home. Definitely try it out."}
{"text":"The presentation was nice,  the staff was friendly, and the place seemed like a nice place to hang out. That's about it though. 

We ordered the Japanese miso and stinky tofu pots in medium spicy. The wait was a little long but they were busy so we didn't mind. Like I said, the presentation was nice but it fell flat flavor- wise. I at least expected the stinky tofu to be, well... stinky. 

I much prefer booming spot mini pot over this place."}
{"text":"Definitely a good spot for hot pot. Been here multiple times already and always have a good experience. The milk tea is surprisingly good. The minced pork rice is a must with your hot pot. I've tried multiple selections of the soup all of them are delicious but my favorite is the kimichi flavor. My least favorite was the one with lamb because it has that weird gamey after taste that I'm not a fan of"}
{"text":"This place is good for winter time. Pot hot is the bomb! Keep you nice and warm! Waiter and waitress are all very nice. Also they give you a stamp card After 10 hot pots you get one free one. Today with the waiting for the food to come out was very bad. We have to wait forever and they made mistake on our food by not putting my beef on the side and no quail eggs in it. We don't know if they have new chef or what but it was not good. Be sue everything else food was good."}
{"text":"Great place, great service, great food. We were blown away. The food was absolutely delicious! We got the Rib Eye Pot and also the popcorn rice plate. The serving portions are big. We enjoyed this place so much and we will be back and recommend it to anyone. Our server was amazing he went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable because we weren't familiar with the menu at all. We appreciated the time he took to explain and recommend the items on their menu. Exquisite."}
{"text":"This place was ok, but it's not really hot pot, everything is precooked, then put into the pot, the only reason to have the fire on underneath is for show. 

It's a bit expensive for what you get. 

Food was delicious and fresh, but nothing really wowed me."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out since I heard so much about it. I must say it was absolutely delicious! I would pick this spot over Shabu Shabu any day. The service was average. The first server was kind enough to explain to us how their Hot Pot works and explained the menu very clear. The portion was quite enough for one person and plus I eat a lot! I wouldn't recommend sharing though unless you are on a diet then why go for it. I ordered Taiwanese spicy pot and it was great. I would agree with some of the other comments that it did come with more vegetables rather than the meat/seafood etc. Anyways, I love how they make different types of tea here. I love tea so kudos to that! Everything went perfectly fine up until I did my last order and I asked for the check. I felt really bad because my two friends were with us and they were tired. We waited for about 20 mins to get our check. I know how it is when work gets overwhelming but when a customer ask for the check please give it to them right away and don't make them wait. I work in the industry myself and I know this. This is just something the servers need to work on. Thank God I'm a great tipper but my two friends didn't tip, so sorry about that! I will definitely be back though! Can't deny good food!"}
{"text":"WOW. Came here super randomly just to see what they had for appetizers and I ended up just ordering a whole hot pot dish for myself. Very glad I did. Just look at the photos! I ordered the seafood and tofu hot pot super spicy and was extremely impressed. Nice amount of spice, delicious and wholesome ingredients, and the broth was exceptional. Minced pork rice was tasty! Real MVP was their corn on the cob pieces, damn. Amazing service as well, very friendly. Would definitely come back. A+!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. It's a lot better that shitty booming pot mini pot spot. It's probably the best personal mini Hotpot in Vegas. They need a Boiling Point here already! Anyways the popcorn chicken is good. The personal pots are good sized lots of meats veggies and etc. The only downfall I hope the fix later on down the road is when you order a add on of meat or what ever for $3.50 is to actually give you what you paid for instead of 2 slices of rib eye... I'll add a photo of what I got which is pretty sad looking. Besides that they messed up on my wife's pot. She ordered a kimchi one and received a seafood one. Which wasn't that big of a deal and they was quick and prompt on fixing it."}
{"text":"Loved it! Will def come back! My wife and I enjoyed the food and service. Its more of soup based meal..but no shortage of meat. One bowl fed us both."}
{"text":"It was my first time here, gloomy weather and missing California lead my fiancé and I to Pot Tea Social House. So glad we stumbled upon this place, I got the rib eye pot and my fiancé got the Taiwanese  pot. It's a twist off of Boiling point in Southern California. 
Food- great portion! But kinda bland I wanted a little more flavorful. Rice with minced pork is my favorite little side dish along with your pot of soup.
Service- Connie is super sweet and very helpful. Very attentive. Even another employee Jennifer (I believe) came by to check on us. 
Price- I say it's very reasonable 35$ for 2 people with our \"speciality teas\" isn't to shabby!!  All pots at 12.99$ except the lobster pot it's 19.99 
Atmosphere- I adore the decor!!! So chic and such homey feeling. Very clean, and simple. 
Would I go back? DEFINITELY next time with our son and family members."}
{"text":"Pot Tea Social is one of my favorite spots for Taiwanese hot pot! The pricing is reasonable for the pots and they always have a good amount of ingredients. I always leave the place feeling super full from eating lol. The service there and waiters are really nice as well. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good and affordable hot pot place!"}
{"text":"This is a great Hotpot place to fill your tummy, this place also sell Authentic popcorn chicken, The manager Wendy is super sweet and friendly"}
{"text":"Spicy beef pot was like a melting pot of deliciousness in my mouth. So good. Way better than jenni pho across the street. And u get more bang for ur Buck thats for sure!"}
{"text":"2nd time coming here. Came here again during the day on a weekend here during the day and we're always the only ones eating. I gave this place a three because overall it was okay. I really liked the first time I came here because of the $13 hotpot. I got the Seafood pot both visits, and I feel like the first time around I really enjoyed the food but this time it was okay. We also ordered popcorn chicken and an extra order of rice. Our visit was $24, they do have a stamp card if you plan on visiting more than once. Some of the food in my hotpot was over cooked before I could even take out the ribeye and some of the seafood just tasted unfresh. The staff is always friendly and we never get bad service. I would just probably go to another hotpot place if you are craving hotpot."}
{"text":"I was actually surprised on how good it was. I haven't had pot tea ever. This was my first time and I can say, I will be back!"}
{"text":"We live in the northwest area of town and drove all the way here for some hot pot! 

It was great! We all order milk tea with boba which was yummy. Shared popcorn chicken which was whoaaaa so good, I can still smell the aroma of freshly fried chicken. 

As far as hot pot, we got the Taiwanese Spicy (super spicy level) hot pot and the Ribeye hot pot (mild spicy level). Both were flavorful and tasty! I like spicy foods and instant noodles so I preferred the Taiwanese one! We had the hot pots with the minced pork rice as a side. Super good. Highly recommend.

The customer service was great! We were always offered drinking water or hot pot broth refills."}
{"text":"This place is great. Not only is it close to me, but it's super clean and has a variety of soup bases to choose from. 

My #1 favorite thing about this place is that it serves BOBA! It's so hard to find a boba tea place around this area.. 

Anyway, I always go with the classic Spicy Beef combination. This place is not stingy by any means. They always pack my hot pot with tons of veggies and meat. The soup is also packed with flavor, and the side of minced pork rice is YUMMY!

The last time I went with friends, we also ordered the Lobster hot pot. There was a huge tail sticking out of my hot pot! It was so cool! But probably because the nature of it being in a hot pot, the tail eventually became overcooked and was chewy. But I can't complain.. it's a lobster tail, sitting in boiling hot soup for a long time.  Of course it'll be chewy.

The only thing I can complain about is: #1 I am so used to eating hot pot with more variety in sauces.. like having sesame oil, minced garlic, a sweet asian bbq sauce.. etc.. I like to mix my own concoction for my sauce and this place doesn't give you that option. You only get the choice of one sauce, and soysauce. 

#1 complaint is.. I prefer my broth to be a bit sweeter. The broth at Pot Tea Social House is more on the salty side. But that's just a personal preference. My fiance loves salty, so he has no qualms about the broth at all!

Overall, it's clean and tasty here. I will come back.. and HAVE been coming back!

Boba and hot pot.. genius!"}
{"text":"Found the cutest fusion hot pot place in a super nice area. I recommend this place because the food was super yummy! I got the Kimchi pot and my friends got Rib Eye and Miso Pots. I enjoyed my soup and although the only thing that I didn't enjoy was that I asked if I can switch my meat for more veggies but they said no and would charge. I didn't understand because on the bottom of the menu under  \"add ons\", meat cost for than veggies. Regardless I just kept the beef in my soup. Over all it was tasty, my soup included clams, crabs and generous amount of tofu :) I would recommend this place, I went around 11 am and left at 12:30 and there were only about 3 tables filled but I think it's because it was an early Tuesday!"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant for several reasons:

1. The Taiwanese broth was very good, not too salty and perfect to eat with minced rice and noodles
2. Service was fast and friendly.
3. The popcorn chicken was crispy and tasty as it looked!
4. The interior design was nice.

Try to get here around noon to get faster service."}
{"text":"I was really dying to go to Pot Tea seeing as I'd drive past it ALL THE TIME. Because Brian P. doesn't eat seafood of any kind, once he was out of town, I decided to take my 3 siblings here for lunch on a stormy hot pot sort of day on 07/05/14.

Now one of my sisters is really picky. Because the other two are substantially younger than us, they copy us. My sister turned up her nose at everything on the menu and so did they. That's how we ended up with 3 orders of popcorn chicken at $5.99 a piece, a BOGO boba for the younger two, and 1 Taiwanese beef hot pot for $11.99.

My hot pot was okay. It was really full and both of the younger two kids each ended up liking what they tried. I think it was because it was novel and I made a big deal about all the different stuff in the pot. 

So why 2 stars? The chicken tasted straight up RANCID. For $18 worth of popcorn chicken, it should be pretty great. Plus, isn't popcorn chicken one of those high turnover items? Did they think we wouldn't notice that that's NOT how chicken is supposed to taste? It was really questionably bad, especially because I could taste the rancid flavor despite being deep fried and piping hot. Imagine the smell of chicken that has gone bad. Now eat that smell. That's how it tasted.

Unfortunately, due to the popocorn chicken, there will not be a repeat business."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere. Highly recommended if you craving for some good hot pot soup and popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"We were looking around town for a spot that served stinky tofu because my friends had a weird experience trying it and thought it would be funny to see how I could handle it. Can't say it was good or bad, lol, but it was tolerable. Would not order it again but glad to say that I tried it!

The chicken wings were really good. I ordered the kimchi hotpot which was just okay. Can't say it's something I would crave to go back again. Definitely will give the other menu items a try though!"}
{"text":"Woke up to a text from a friend yesterday telling me to go try this place and let him know how it is. And yesterday was so crazy windy the foodie fest shut down for the day so why not?

They've got a number of different hotpots to try. Between #1 and #2 I went with the seafood and tofu hotpot while my friend went with the other one. 

The last time I had hotpot was at boiling point in Cali and I was disappointed with mine. This had the right amount of napa cabbage for me not to get annoyed with. I felt like they weren't trying to take my money with mostly cabbage. It was a great combination of different seafood items and meat :D. Also had a piece of crab and two pieces of shrimp. 

Looking forward to other crazy random chilly days to try it out. Not that you have to since the AC feels like it's cranked up so it's pretty cold in there (for me since I get cold really easily). Definitely coming back soon to try the other pots. 

My server, Sae, was such a sweetheart. She's great, sociable, and such a sweetheart. She found things of interest to talk about that didn't make me feel like you're just trying to make small talk for the heck of it. She was genuine. 

It's not always credit card friendly so be prepared with cash just in case. Cash only the second time around, too. :("}
{"text":"Loved this place! Decor is nice and simple and so is the menu. 5 appetizers, about 10 different \"pots\" , about 6 or 8 types of tea and the desert of the day. I ordered the seafood pot, it had real crab, clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp and fish. The flavors were clean, you can taste every ingredient and know they are fresh and the broth was perfect... Pair that with steam rice topped with delicious minced pork and the highly addictive \"milk tea\", which in my opinion was better than Thai iced tea. Oh, and let's not forget the service which was outstanding! If anything, I think the employees try a little too hard, but that's understandable, since as a new business they want to make the best first impression. I was impressed. They got me. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great price, what more could a girl ask for?!

I am completely obsessed with hotpot, and even more, obsessed with hotpot that offers stinky tofu!  my last meal on earth, i would ask for stinky tofu hands down.  

Ordere the fried stinky tofu and the stinky tofu hotpot that comes with your choice of rice, vermicelli and something else (this is unusual as most other places charge extra for that).  

Plenty of food, the broth is amazing, i got medium spicy, very manageable and delicious.  The waitresses were so attentive and sweet, really makes a place way more likable. They are always checking to make sure you have enough water, soup, and if you want the fire out- all VERY VERY important when having hotpot :)  

will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I think it's a it over priced for the quality of meat they provided. The broth base is alright not quite full bold flavor like I had before for the same Taiwanese style. I like the stinky tofu if you can bypass the smell, you may appreciate the taste!!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE WAS AMAZING!!! Hands down, best hot pot I've had so far. The owner Wendy was serving us. I had a party of 6. She was very welcoming and friendly. My friends and I ordered the Korean, miso, beef, and the popcorn chicken. They were all delicious! I especially love the miso hot pot and their milk tea! You have the option to chose rice,minced pork rice, or noodles with your hot pot. I've chosen the pork rice because she said it was the most popular. The rice was amazing! I think I would go their just to order that amazing rice!! The minced pork had so much flavor. I'm craving it right now as I'm typing this :(  my favorite hot pot would have to be the miso hot pot. It just tasted great, not too watery and had lots of flavors going on. Each hot pot came with veggies, shrimp, and a crab claw. The hot pot itself is good for one person if you're super hungry or for two people that have small appetites. 

I definitely recommend this place to anyone that's in the area! It's worth a try!!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and they were so sweet! Although I felt horrible because we came in 30 minutes before they were closing. They had been already cleaning up and getting ready for closing since it was not busy. But they welcomed us in and they didn't give us any attitude. They were very patient with us too! The food was amazing, I got the kimchi pot and it was delicious and they give you a lot of it too! The waiters were so sweet telling us to take our time eating, but I still felt bad. Anyways the service was great and the store looked cute too. I would definitely go back when i have the chance!"}
{"text":"I have been on a hunt for good hot pot/mini pot place in Vegas, I had so much hope for this because, since it seemed like boiling point in LA. I was wrong. 

I tried both the kimchi pot and the Taiwanese pot. The menu looked good enough, but the broth is just not very flavorful and everything else in the soup don't seem very fresh. I am not a super fan of boiling point in LA, but I like their pots so much better. Overall, service was good, and food was fast. I probably won't drive 30 min to come to this place, due to the lack of flavor and freshness."}
{"text":"5 stars for the service!
Juni who is very attentive and asks us more than 3 times how we like the food and is there anything he can get for us!! 

4.5 stars for the interior.
Very clean, neat, and spacious environment to dine in. 

3 stars for the food.
Other than the popcorn chicken, other food is mediocre. The broth of hot pots is light, and the portion is poor."}
{"text":"Food: We ordered the chicken, which was so yummy. Reminded me of Chinese crispy pork flavor for some reason. 
I had the Japanese miso (spicy level medium). I thought it was a good sized portion with a variety of vegetables some seafood and pork. I had also ordered an extra side of beef, which I thought was also a good sized portion. If you like spicy, I didn't think that the medium level was that spicy either. 
Drinks: I got plain black tea which I loved. And my boyfriend got lychee tea which was sweet and super good! 
We also got the strawberry tea, which wasn't that sweet but it was alright. I liked the lychee tea the best. 
Service:The service was just alright. We had came later in the night around 9, so the server we had was pretty preoccupied with sweeping the floors.  Other than that, everything was great! Would definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"Vegas is like our second home so when I heard of Pot Tea I was really excited that I can get something like Boiling Point in Vegas. The first time I ordered the rib eye and loved it. It was loaded with veggies and beef, and the flavor was clean. Recently, I ordered the seafood pot and I was just a tad disappointed. It seems like the portion has gotten smaller. It is still good but with the higher price and no complementary drink for lunch, I don't think it is worth it. 

I do like the option that you can substitute the pork with beef since I don't eat pork much."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago with my friend and enjoyed one of the hot pots we ordered. I believe my friend ordered the ribeye hot pot and it looked like she enjoyed it. I ordered the seafood and tofu hot pot with some Ramen noodles on the side plus it also comes with some steamed rice and ground pork on top. The Hot Pot itself was priced at about 12 bucks not a bad deal! It came with sliced meat, fish balls, crab, shrimp, mussels etc it was just really tasty Hot Pot that was small enough for one person with some leftovers as well. My total with a hot pot and extra noodles plus tip for the waiter is around 20 bucks! I will definitely be back for more hot pot yumminess!"}
{"text":"YASSSSS!

I was happy to find a Taiwanese-styled hot pot place in Vegas. If you're ever in the area and looking for a delicious hot pot meal, I'd definitely reccomend Pot Tea Social House.

Service? ON POINT! They were super awesome!

I ordered the Rib Eye Beef Pot with pork and rice and the Chicken Wings. The Rib Eye Beef was delicious! However, it was overshadowed by the side of rice with pork on top of it. 

I tried to like the chicken wings, but I just couldn't. It didn't taste too good and it had a weird after taste. I thought maybe the chicken was old, or if the oil they cooked it in was bad. Regardless, I wouldn't order this again.

Great place though! I'd come again."}
{"text":"Pot Tea opened recently and my friend and I decided to give them a try. We arrived around 7 on a Wednesday and the place was pretty packed. 

I went with the spicy beef hot pot and my fried ordered the lobster hot pot as well as a chicken wing appetizer. The wings came out first and they were tiny. They looked dry, but were surprisingly moist. They lacked any sort of flavor and definitely needed a little more seasoning or sauce. 

The hot pots came out and they were surprisingly large. I'm not well-versed in this cuisine but after my dining companion mentioned the lack of dipping sauces (they only offer two) it definitely felt lacking. More options would have helped quite a bit, I think. My spicy beef was actually quite spicy and flavorful. Opting for the vermicelli noodles over rice helped retain all the flavor from the broth. 

Despite the spiciness level being right on, nothing else about our meal was particularly memorable. Everything  was just ok. My friend seemed less than enthused with her lobster hot pot and said she regretted getting rice instead of vermicelli. 

The place is new, so I cut them some slack as far as service. They were busy and the severs seemed to be trying their best. Everyone was really nice, so I give them kudos for that.

Make sure you bring cash, since they are currently cash only."}
{"text":"Such a great service!! Food is so delicious!! I have been here twice and both time they have such a an excellent service and everyone here are very friendly it like family!!!
Especially Wendy who is so family oriented!!! I definitely will be back again."}
