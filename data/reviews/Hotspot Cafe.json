{"text":"Our receptionist just brought me your Cobb salad a minute ago (our office orders from you at least once a week). While my number one criteria for judging salads is the dressing, I was horrified at the quality of lettuce you used for yours!!  While I love the quality of blue cheese and chicken you used on the salad, skimping on the actual lettuce is mind-boggling. If I am paying $13 for a lunch salad, I'd like the lettuce to be fresh and not rotten.  I am seriously disappointed and it ruined the whole lunch for me."}
{"text":"If you want traditional home-cooked meals with good service and a cheap price, then come here! I am so satisfied with this restaurant"}
{"text":"Went there in the morning for a late breakfast with my family.  They had a sign that said to seat yourself.  We sat close to the door.  After 20 minutes of no service, I walked and talked to an employee.  5 minutes later we had water and coffee.  After not seeing our waitress after waiting another 10 minutes we left, leaving $3 for the coffee.  Huge disappointment. Don't go unless you have all day!!!"}
{"text":"I have had a perfect experience every time I have eaten here. The service is exceptional, always with a smile, the food is great and you can't beat the value. Everyone I take here agrees. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"If you need breakfast or lunch and you are downtown it is a must see. Also added bonus you can charge your electronics at table. The homemade granola is the absolute best ever for breakfast. The lunch special sandwiches will amaze you. If you go downtown and don't stop by you are doing yourself an injustice."}
{"text":"Nice little cafe in downtown Cleveland.  Food was good and customer service was great!"}
{"text":"I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese bagel. It was very good! Great food, great service, comfortable atmosphere, and clean! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here today , best breakfast I've had in awhile......the Western Omelet is great!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch cafe!  It is a really convenient location for people staying at the Hilton Garden Inn."}
{"text":"Awful service - waited 15 minutes for a table, waited 15 minutes for menus and water, waited 15 minutes to give our order, waited 30 minutes - still no food and I don't think the food had hit the grill yet - walked out."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the atmosphere and it is the little things that matter, like warm syrup and friendly service. I will be back."}
{"text":"The more i come to this place the lower their standards get. Their fruit bowl was rotten. And we once got a hair in our food. the service isnt that great either"}
{"text":"Have been there many times and although the wait can be long,food was good. But recently they have become so popular that they can't really keep up and the service and quality of food has suffered.  Too many people and too few cooks make for a long wait for food which is now just mediocre cause they are just throwing it together as fast as they can. The bathroom was nauseatingly filthy cause apparently no one has time to keep it clean. Probably won't be going back for a while which is sad cause we really liked the food their first year which is why we kept coming back."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in Cleveland for a convention. We are from Pittsburgh and tried out this place. Friendly server, fast service and portions are great for the price! Food was great also!"}
{"text":"The Kitchen Manager is unprofessional and is not great under pressure AT ALL. He was intimidated and very rude during a \"Lunch Rush.\" Literally every other employee was calm and collected. He's just a sad balding man."}
{"text":"Our waiter, Damonte, was the best part of this visit.  We both had the corned beef hash and eggs. Too many potatoes! Eggs cooked perfectly but I ordered my English muffin \"toasted well\" and when the kitchen put up the dish, the line man commented...is that toasted well?, and it wasn't even brown at all, so it had to be sent back causing a delay for me, since I already had my breakfast. If it's not right, don't send it out. Corned beef was tasty. My pet peeve is, why, why, why do all restaurants carry Smuckers jam when it has high fructose syrup in it? Delete it! Carry a better quality jam. I'm just passing through town but next time I stop, I'll try someplace else. This just didn't stand out as special enough to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"I will start with the positives. The food was good. Cleanliness and atmosphere of restaurant was great.  The food came out very slow. But I'm ok with that. I was not in a hurry and I think we could all slow down a bit. I enjoyed my company while waiting on the food.  My biggest problem and my biggest problem with most restaurants these days are the servers. Just plain bla. The attitude was as if they could care less wether we where there or not.  Here's your table, here's your menu, what would you like, here's your food, here's your bill.   I will go back. The food and atmosphere is worth it. And maybe the server was just having a bad day. We shall see."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the staff is welcoming and very nice, the place itself is comfortable. There were only 3 other tables being served when we arrived and it took over 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order. It then took another 40 minutes for our food to arrive. When we reminded our server that we had ordered a side of hash browns, she came back within 5 minutes, but had to send them back because we had ordered them with onion and cheese! Finally they got it right. I want to love this place but we can't spend over an hour on breakfast or lunch! We came in around 1:00 and got out around 2:20. They close at 3:00, yet we only saw 3 employees working. Next time we might just order takeout so it's ready, then take it in to eat it!"}
{"text":"Cute place with great decor. We were in Cleveland for the rock and roll Hall of Fame and were looking for breakfast for the family. Unfortunately, our meals were extremely disappointing. Veggie omelettes were made with raw, large cut veggies and the avocado promised in the breakfast burrito was mysteriously absent.  Pancakes were satisfactory."}
{"text":"This is a great new spot for Cleveland! I brought my niece and nephews here for some breakfast pastries to find out we could order food and sit down.This was a pleasant surprise. I am glad there is finally a place where you can feel like you are getting a \"real\" meal and are invited to stay and work. With outlets at every both and free wi-fi it makes for a great place to get work done.       Ok back to food: between 4 kids and 2 adults we ordered a little bit of everything. Over easy eggs with bacon, yogurt parfait, omelet, pastries, chocolate chip pancakes, and creme brulee french toast. I am a french toast snob and very particular. I usually will not order it out but I asked the server her opinion and she convinced me to try it. I am so glad I tried the french toast. It was slightly crispy on the outside with a nice custardy taste on the inside (I can't stand dry over cooked french toast or too mushy). Served with Ohio maple syrup even better.       My only concern is for The HotSpot's future. I am not sure the people who like to sit down and get work done are the type of people who want a server and sit down atmosphere. I hope this catches on in Cleveland because this has become my new breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Very attentive server. Wonderful portion size. Fresh fruit really was FRESH! Server gave us some cronuts for free! Hubs and I each had great bfast sandwiches. Kids loved the pancakes and bacon.   Atmosphere pretty modern. A bit sparse and under lit, but that could just be my preference."}
{"text":"Definitely a notch above the Subway I walked past to get here. Very nice and modern upscale look. Staff was friendly and very quick to seatbme, asking if I wanted to face the TV with a basketball game on. Ample menu items to pick from, I had the 1/2 sandwich and soup for lunch. It was great and I would definitely come back to try more items on the menu. Twice the price of Subway and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Used to be good but Gyro George isn't.  Rotten service, wrong orders that don't get fixed, even the ketchup bottles empty.   The food is quite a bit worse than the Hot Spot.   We will not be back."}
{"text":"Very good value for breakfast.  I had an omelette and hubby had corned beef & hash...both fresh and very tasty.  Free WiFi too!"}
{"text":"The only two redeeming qualities of this location are the free parking attached to building and the French toast. If you're going to get anything from the breakfast menu, we recommend the French toast and that's about the only thing we can recommend.   Unfortunately there was a gnat in one of our waters, but the waitress was apologetic and took care of it quickly. Sadly it was just another strike against rating this place any higher.  I ordered a skillet breakfast in which the menu stated would come with 3 eggs, but it only came with 2. I asked for over easy eggs and received over hard eggs. Such a disappointment when you're expecting a delicious runny yolk over the potatoes under the \"skillet.\" Overall the dish was bland and lacked seasoning.   The egg burrito was also bland and lacked seasoning. We ordered a side of turkey sausage and it was nothing special.   The French toast on the other hand had great flavor. It wasn't soggy in the slightest."}
{"text":"You need to eat here! Consider this establishment the 8th wonder of the world!!!! The pancakes are made just right and they have an Ohio maple syrup that's to love for. And if you really want to see fireworks, check out their crème brûlée French toast! Fireworks like the 4th of July will resound!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered egg white omelet with onions, mushrooms and cheese.  The mushrooms are cut too big so they were not cooked.  Both the onions and mushroom were raw.  Ordered also steel cut oatmeal.  The bowl was huge.  May be a good idea to have a smaller portion option available.  The service was awesome.  I love the little shelves at the both next to a plug to be able to charge your phone/laptop/iPad."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast. Like the side choices with the breakfast items, as well as the flavor combination of pancakes. Was really excited to see a Bison Burger and was pleasantly surprised it tasted very good despite it being little under cooked. Unique pasta salad which tasted great. Charging stations great idea and very convenient, WIFI not always available even though stated as available."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to this restaurant but it won't be my last! The food is delicious and well prepared. Damonte, the host, was most friendly and the server, Jackie, who I was also fortunate to have, was outstandingly attentive. B|"}
{"text":"Service was slow, food was mediocre.  Do not recommend.  We got a table freshly cleaned, but had to ask for silverware.  Menus came to use AFTER another table that came in 5 mins after us and their order was taken before ours.  Corn beef hash is not hash. Sausage was bland."}
{"text":"Pros for this place are very easy access/free parking and very good service.  The menu is fine, I guess, but unremarkable.  Overall, would recommend more for breakfast (very competitive pricing and food) than the lunches--which are overpriced for the portions.  The biggest complaint I have is that they hype their \"all day\" breakfast on their web page and on their signage, but sit down for lunch and NONE of the breakfast items are on there."}
{"text":"We came to Cleveland for one day for an Indian's game. We stayed with our 3 kids at the Hilton Garden Inn next door.  I wanted to try a local place for breakfast before leaving the city.  We ordered-    -tall stack of french toast w/bacon -tall stack of blueberry pancakes w/bacon -regular stack of blueberry pancakes w/bacon  -simple breakfast (2 eggs, toast, home fries and bacon) -a two egg bacon and cheese breakfast w/home fries -side of sausage  For drinks we all got waters and one had a milk.  Every meal was excellent.  The pancakes were enormous.  I got a regular stack (3) and could only eat one and a half. The pancakes are on the heavier side.  So if you prefer very light pancakes, these wouldn't be your thing.    The bill came to $39 for five hearty meals. They have a yelp online deal where if you check in you get 10% off.  I honestly felt a little guilty taking advantage of this.  The prices were already insanely cheap.    With tax included we spent $39 for a hearty sit down breakfast for 5 people.  The service was excellent. It was a Saturday morning and the place was fairly full.  The food came out fast and our server seemed to have quite a few tables and still paid excellent attention to our needs.  They have free parking and Wi-Fi and are only a tenth of a mile from Progressive Field.  If we ever make it back to Cleveland, we will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend and found this breakfast spot on our last day. Wish we had found it on the first. Excellent service. Excellent atmosphere and great food. They even offer vegan choices. They need to put some fliers at the Hilton down the road."}
{"text":"I discovered Hotspot Cafe on the recommendation of my hotel's desk staff. The restaurant is fairly large for a diner-type restaurant, which means that there's a ton of seating and a very short wait. I went twice and had the same waiter both times. He was one of the friendliest servers that I've ever had and recognized me the second time around. The turkey sandwich was huge, and the bread was thick and fresh. The fries were steamy hot, and the pickles even tasted homemade. The pancakes were crispy around the edges and buttery, and everything on the menu is very affordable. Hotspot offers a great dining experience, with friendly staff, at a great price."}
{"text":"Very nicely designed cafe within 2 mins walk from the Hilton Garden Inn. Went for breakfast and one of us got pancakes, another a mixed scramble and the third oatmeal.  We went at about 8:30am on a Monday and the place was not crowded.  Service was quick, friendly and attentive. Each dish was well made with very large portions.  More than I could handle. I had the short stack of pancakes and could only eat one. The short stack came with a choice of breakfast meat. The scramble was served with potatoes and toast. The oats had a choice of fruits and nuts.  All was very good."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the worst lunch place I have been to in the area. I was looking for something quick, convenient and reasonably priced and decided to give Hotspot Cafe a try.   The menu itself looked pretty ok, so I chose a grilled chicken breast wrap which was on the menu at $7.50 plus tax. A little expensive, but whatever - I was hungry. I was served quickly and the variety of toppings available were pretty reasonable. I didn't think they looked very fresh, especially the onions and lettuce. Again, no big deal - it's a sandwich.   Where things really went down hill was at the register. $7.50 plus tax came to $9.05. Really?! By my calculations it's closer to $8.50. I didn't have time to argue so just paid and left.  When I got back to my office, hungry and broke, I started to eat my wrap. The chicken was of very poor quality and was pale in colour, and the rest of the wrap wasn't much better. Maybe it was the feeling of having been ripped off, or maybe it was the awful ingredients.   Either way, the whole thing ended up going in the garbage, and I went hungry rather than eat it. Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"A lot of new wait staff.  I ordered the yogurt parfait and crispy bacon!  Everything was delicious.   Brought home a chicken gyro for later!   Great place for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"I'm a girl that loves her breakfast. Hotspot Cafe did not disappoint!  The restaurant is nice and quiet. It has \"charging stations\" set up at the booths. It's wireless doesn't always work, but I'm not writing a review on internet connections.   The waitstaff is attentive and hospitable. The manager always makes sure we are taken care of. It is obvious that he takes pride in his establishment.   I have come here for breakfast and for lunch and the food was fantastic both visits.   On my first visit, I got the pancake sampler as I was very intrigued about adding coconut to my pancakes. The sampler came with 6 smallish pancakes, you can pick up to 3 flavors. I picked standard buttermilk, chocolate chip, and coconut. I was a little hesitant on the coconut. I've never heard of coconut. Oh my goodness, that coconut pancake was one of the best ever tasted!  Perfectly cooked. I ate every single pancake on my plate, it was that good. I also got some breakfast potatoes that were to die for. Unlike most places, these hash browns met a potato.   It has been a good while since I have visited this restaurant, but I can't wait to come back for more."}
{"text":"Only 3 stars for the food and cleanliness but an added star just for Albina from Albania! That smile and hospitality!"}
{"text":"I have no idea how this has a high rating still.   From as far as I can tell, Gyro George has replaced Hotspot. They no longer serve the Hotspot menu and only serve their own. They should stop calling themselves a cafe. The Gyro George menu is extremely limited and only has a few breakfast options.   The service was almost comically slow and there were only a few customers in the restaurant. Our server was inattentive. The place was dirty, with multiple tables that had yet to be bussed.   My order was wrong. I don't eat pork and there was sausage on the egg and cheese sandwich. My server acknowledged this, laughed, and said \"more for you\". Ugh. The food that was made correctly was disappointing.  It took about 20 minutes after eating to get our check."}
{"text":"Good spot downtown for breakfast or lunch meetings but I don't think I would have any reason to come here by myself or if I was with others and looking for a good dining experience. The food at Hotspot is okay but completely unexciting: a limited number of standards constitutes the menu both at breakfast (omelettes, oatmeal, breakfast meats) and lunch (soups, salads, burgers, sandwiches). The service is good and while the price isn't dirt cheap, it's definitely inexpensive fare."}
{"text":"The pasta and meatballs I got was okay, and the portion was okay. There was a large spill of something sticky at the table and floor where I first went to sit. Overall just okay."}
{"text":"I would give them 5 stars but the didn't advertise at our hotel 2 blocks away where the buffet was time limited and expensive $11.99. We found the Hot Spot the day before we left, but omg the food, service and price were right on spot. If you stay at the Hilton Garden Inn be sure to check this place out."}
{"text":"Being from out of town, I look at yelp a lot for advice.   There is nothing worse than a bad experience when out of town to relax.  While in Cleveland My hubby and I went to the hotspot cafe after seeing it in yelp.   Extremely pleased.   Our waiter Wilbur was pleasant and friendly.   The food was delicious.  Portions large.   Atmosphere great.   Try it.  You will love it.   Only one problem.   I wanted to go there one more time but unfortunately Sunday was the only option and their closed."}
{"text":"I ordered carry out & the wait wasn't long for a Sunday. I order French toast, bacon, sausage & eggs. French toast was good & flavorful, bacon was some of the best bacon I've tasted, eggs were light, fluffy & good with the cheese, & the sausage was the worst, they tasted like grease sponges. Overall it was a good breakfast despite the sausage. It wasn't noisy & the order take was average. It was a good buy too.  Oh & free parking downtown?! Best thing ever!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our brunch before the show on Playhouse Square on Sunday. The food was good and there was plenty of it! We'll be back. Also, it's extremely convenient because it's right off the freeway."}
{"text":"Their food was amazing and cheap and even had outlets at the table to plug your phone in"}
{"text":"This 5 star review is based on the Turkey & Bacon club at the Hot Spot. This sandwich is one of my go to \"slayer meals\" when I'm at school and prepared to eat a meal for 2.   I eat this sandwich so often I only have to show up at the door and the sweet chef will begin toasting the bread for me.   We're looking at 3 whole wheat pieceS of toast spread with mayo, a stack of sliced turkey breast, tomatoes, hot peppers, lettuce and FIVE STRIPS OF BACON! The amount of bacon in this sandwich is perfect, you get a crispy piece with every single bite. It is so damn satisfying I have gotten at least ten of my friends on to it .  Now. Don't go there and order a bacon and egg sandwich (which is killer btw) or some chicken salad wrap and msg me and tell me that it's not 5 star worthy, read the first line of this review and then comment.   FIVE STRIPS OF BACON!  This sandwich is perfect. Yah I said it."}
{"text":"The Hotspot was recommended by some of the locals here in Cleveland. It's always a good thing when a restaurant is within walking distance of your hotel.   Luckily, it wasn't too busy and we were seated immediately. Our hostess was also our server ( +2 other tables). He was pulling double duty and was doing it well.   I ordered the Cleveland Special and my boyfriend ordered the Greek Omelet. Our food was actually really good. The pancakes were huge. I couldn't finish my meal. The Greek Omelet tasted better than I expected. We spent less than $25 on two meals, coffee, and drinks.   Of course, there are mixed reviews. However, our visit was pleasant and whenever I return to Cleveland I would definitely visit."}
{"text":"This place was good. We were the only ones in the restaurant the whole time we were there. The service was fast. We had the grilled cheese, the classic bacon burger, the build your own skillet, and the smothered burger. All main food was delicious but the sides were lacking. The fries were okay and the broccoli cheddar soup was below average. Also, the ranch was really strange. Overall we enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"They have Cronuts!!!  I was visiting Cleveland from DC, and stopped in to this charming place.  It has a lot of potential, but the breakfast was average.  I had the corned beef hash, and was disappointed by the thinly sliced corned beef.   It seemed more appropriate for a sandwich.   On the upside, the service was good, and they have Cronuts."}
{"text":"Good hot food, basic breakfast stuff. Good and quick service. Nothing fancy, but if you want a good quick basic meal at a reasonable price, go here."}
{"text":"fresh ingredients (this is quality food), great service (fast and friendly), great tasting food. very reasonable prices (especially for a place in Downtown. AND FREE parking, right Downtown. what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Unless you like dry, hard, cardboard-like gyro, avoid this place. The pancakes were great though, and they do have decent service."}
{"text":"The waitress was very friendly, the food was ok but not great, I guess just pretty average. Our food sat under the warming light for awhile, which dried out the eggs. The bathroom walls and corners need a good scrub as well."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food. Great food. Gyro was amazing and the fries were ample and delicious. Prices a bit high bit servings were abundant."}
{"text":"Just a great place to be,stop in and try them out  if ever in their area. Love the coffee and kindness they offer."}
{"text":"Average breakfast food with below average coffee and longer than average wait times for food."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick yummy breakfast before heading out of town, and we found exactly that! Stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn just .1 miles from here, so it was a quick walk.. Breakfast for two included an omelette with 3 ingredients, home fries (sliced potatoes), toast, and coffee.. Came to just under $20 with the 10% Yelp check-in discount! Fast service, great food, A+!"}
{"text":"Traveling through from Indianapolis and found this spot on Yelp for breakfast. The staff was friendly, food was yummy, quick turn around, good parking and fair prices."}
{"text":"Greasy spoons step aside, there's a new spot in town, Hotspot Cafe! If your looking for a step up from your normal breakfast and lunch fare, you will be one happy camper when visiting Hotspot. First off, let's talk ambiance, the space is open with lots of natural light and plenty of seating, a party of 4 or 14 can easily be accommodated in the large space. I even noticed that they have what looks like a meeting/banquet type room in the back that can be closed off for top secret meetings and the like ;) The hostess was friendly and welcoming and took me right to my dining companion that was waiting for me at the table already. The great service continued with out server who was attentive, friendly and prompt.  As I've mentioned in previous reviews, if you have Tang on your menu, you're alright in my book! This delicious orange beverage can be enjoyed here and hopefully will spark a city-wide trend on getting this on menus all over town. So on to the food, the breakfast menu looks amazing, I was toying with the idea of getting the pancakes for lunch but opted for the soup/sandwich combo. I enjoyed the veggie soup and the salmon BLT which was unbelievable! My dining companion enjoyed the triple cheese burger and soup which looked equally delicious. I really like the fact that the offerings are a bit more gourmet, I had a really hard time choosing something because everything sounded super tasty. This is definitely not your $5 lunch spot but as they say, you get what you pay for and here it is freshness, ambiance, great service and an interesting array of menu choices.   The booths in the middle are all equipped with charging stations and there is free wifi throughout which makes it a great place for business lunches. I will definitely be back to slowly work my way through both the breakfast and lunch menus!"}
{"text":"Came in because I had a coupon.  This place was weird.  Ordered a breakfast skillet- why are there potatoes on the side as well as in the skillet?  I love potatoes, but that was overkill.  Service was pretty slow.  They processed our coupon without an issue and they were very friendly when we had questions about it.  But something seemed a little \"off\" here, I don't think I'd go back if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Easy to get to, close to the highway, i thoroughly enjoyed my time here. The food was your usual diner/cafe food, typical sandwiches, salads and soups, its great for breakfast or brunch they close early so no dinner crowd. The service was great, friendly, helpful, fast.  Wifi and charging ports at every booth ! yasss! but okay if you want a romantic phone free meal this isnt the spot lol, its geared for the nerd/techie which is perfect for me and my husband.  Pricing was reasonable and good. Their corned beef hash was really good, cooked perfectly, not too greasy like some places tend to get theirs. Their chicken pesto sandwich was fantaabulous ( a word i made up when im food happy), the pesto was fresh, the bread crisp, just great!  if you're in the area definetly stop in!"}
{"text":"Charging stations, excellent wifi, and amazing coffee. This has to be my new favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"Free parking, WiFi, and charging stations at the booths, make this place stand out. I got the HotSpot Burrito and it was great. The pancakes were also large and hearty. Definitely a place to check out for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Very fast efficient service.  Delicious Cobb salad was loaded,  and had tender warm  chicken breast.  Salad for lunch was  $13.00 ice tea was $2.50"}
{"text":"This looks like a fun lunch place. The service is pretty good. I tried the Polish Boy because somebody said it was a Cleveland thing. It had a kielbasa on a bun topped with cole slaw (that was a big selling point for me) and fries. All of these things are good separate and even between together! I ate all but one bite of the kielbasa (it was really gonna put me over the edge. Talk about the food coma I had)! This was simple and yummy. I was a bit nervous the kielbasa would be not be to my liking - there are so many different types but it was perfect, closer to a grilled hotdog than some of the fancier sausages. This would be perfect at a baseball game."}
{"text":"Very nice space. Service was good but they were closing soon and mine was the only table. Homemade veggie rice soup was excellent as was the coffee. BLT was very good but a little pricey at $9.95. Overall very satisfied. I will be back."}
{"text":"I don't see the negativity. The service was really good. They have free parking right next to the restaurant, which is great downtown. The manager was nice, made sure to say hello. I had the steel cut oat meal, nice and flavorful. With 3 separate sides, raisins, nuts that I asked for, and Brown sugar. It came out piping hot, and was not mushy or overcooked. It was done just right. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero if I could but alas they get a single star. Walked to this place to have a good meal, they were recommended by someone walking by that worked at the Salvation Army. It took 55 minutes to get my lunch which consisted of a fish sandwich and fries. It was to come on a roll but somehow I got sour dough bread instead. I did not ask for anything other than mayo but got a salad portion of lettuce and tomatoes on the sandwich. The fries would have been good if they were hot instead of barely warm. I didn't ask to have a replacement as who knows how long I would have sat there. The waitress only came back at the end to give me a bill even though I tried over and over to get a soda refill."}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast and lunch. The food is always good. I think it's a great place to meet clients because  it's close to downtown but has parking and us quiet enough to talk shop."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with coworkers and the food came out quickly enough for  lunch break. I ordered a hamburger which was cooked perfectly.   The service leaves some to be desired as even the owner was running around picking up the waitress's slack.   In any case, Hotspot serves delicious food downtown and has its own free parking lot."}
{"text":"I know everyone loves this place, but I have now eaten breakfast here twice, and I just don't understand why people like this place.  I don't normally say this about food, because my mother would spank me for saying it.  The food here is gross. I thought the first time was a fluke, but sadly, it wasn't. When I was here the first time, it was for a breakfast meeting with all  of my colleagues (about 20 of us). They have a nice back room where you can have a meeting, and the service was great. It's been over a year since we had that meeting, but I remember the breakfast was not appetizing.  I remember it being a little greasy.  I went there a couple of days ago, and the experience was the same.  I ordered some Cleveland special that comes with 2 pancakes, eggs the way you want it, and a meat (I chose turkey sausage).  The turkey sausage was fine, but it was the pancakes this time.  Y'all. How do you mess up on pancakes??????? It's so easy!  When they brought out my order and I tasted the pancakes, they were gummy on the inside, and tasted weird. I figured that they just weren't cooked long enough, so I told the waitress, and she had another set ordered for me well done.  When she brought the second set, they weren't much browner than the first set, and when I tasted it, same thing.  A little less gummy, but same weird taste.  It took me a minute to figure it out, but there is something way wrong with their batter. It's really disgusting.  It almost taste like they are sourdough, which is weird, because I didn't know you could buy sourdough flour.  It didn't have the sweetness or lightness pancakes are supposed to have.  I know that they used to do sourdough french toast, but that wasn't what I ordered. I just wanted some regular pancakes.  I ate one of the second set and saved the other for breakfast for another day, hoping that maybe it just needed a day to marinate. I just heated it up in the microwave and my coworkers were wondering what was wrong with my pancake and why it smelled weird.  I told them my theory, and they both nodded in agreement. They said it smells like a sourdough or something like that too.  Hotspot, please change your batter. We just want regular pancakes.  I didn't give it one star because service was wonderful, and the rest of it was edible. It's just a shame."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast on a Saturday morning. The food tasted fresh and they provided great service! The prices are affordable and they give big portions. We ordered the short stack of French toast and the skillet. Both were excellent, the French toast had cinnamon on it. We'd definitely recommend this place and come again!"}
{"text":"My middle name is Bacon, and this is some of the best. Food was so good but service was so so. I wish I had more water and more coffee more quickly and I'm still not sure what took our server so long because the place wasn't busy at 12:30 on a Saturday. Either way I would definitely go back, a little off the main area of downtown on Carnegie, kind of in between the Wolfstein Center and Progressive Stadium (across the street), but worth the short walk for a good, cheap breakfast in a contemporary, clean and casual place."}
{"text":"Tucked away in King east and convenient for George Brown students, right across the street from the campus, is this cute little cafe that surprised me. I was wondering aimlessly around the streets of Toronto, starving and not finding something that would satisfy my appetite. I come across this cafe and craved for a sandwich all of a sudden.   I didn't expect much from this establishment but they had quite the wide selection of choices to eat from. Lots of sandwiches, some come with a salad as a combo, homemade mac and cheese, pasta with meatballs... Wow I was a little overwhelmed with choices but one stuck out and I chose the grilled chicken sandwich.   Now something that I've never heard of before, you get a minimum of 3 toppings and each extra topping is an added charge...hmm. I'm not a topping Queen or anything, just a simple lettuce and tomato girl but I don't think that's very fair.   I also tried the homemade mac and cheese which completely turned my stomach off. I'm more of a KD girl myself but that stuff was...not anything I've ever had. At least the salad that came with it was decent, heavy on the sauce but nothing too terrible.  All in all it's a decent place to stop in for a quick bite, the grilled chicken sandwich was phenomenal but it could've been my hunger speaking. And it's a little bit pricey as I paid $6.99 for 2 pieces of toast, grilled chicken, lettuce, tomato, mayo and alfalfa sprouts. While the mac and cheese was a large portion, with a salad, I don't know if I would pay $7.49 for it."}
{"text":"Visited the Hotspot for lunch also. Terrific Burger and Asparagus / Potato soup. Efficient service, great pricing, and awesome food.  Continues to impress me. Again the free parking and charging stations are great perks, particularly downtown.  Get In while you can,   It's gonna be a hugely popular spot in CLE."}
{"text":"Pretty average place so far based on the menu and the cafe in general. Staff were really nice. There's also free wifi! Prices seem a tad bit higher considering the food that they serve. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I dunno about this place. I've got a problem with places that serve ordinary foods for extraordinary prices.  How can u charge someone $7 for a crappy, average salad?? Unless the salad comes with a T-bone steak attached, there's no way they can justify that price!  Had the breaded chicken cutlet and it tasted okay.. The last time I ate here, I had the chicken Parmesan sandwich w/ Cesar salad and the verdict is in: MEH!  Its not like this place is terrible... but if I can't think of anywhere else to go for lunch, then MAYBE i'll go to Hotspot... ACTUALLY there's a dollarama nearby, I'd hit that place up before the Hot Spot... I'm sure the ingredients come from there ne way... oh ya, they use simulated bacon bits in the salad; you've been warned."}
{"text":"Took a friend there for lunch. We both have never been. Excellent service and the amount if good was unbelievable.  Taste was spot on. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice.    Breakfast both times.    Food was good.  Service was unbelievable terrible from start to finish.    Took over 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge our table of 4.    Service was slow the whole time and no one seemed to care.    Food took forever to get also.   They have parking.   Convenient location but hope you aren't in a hurry."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning before noon. Restaurant was clean and spacious inside. The place wasn't packed but service was still very slow. Menu had basic breakfast foods- pancakes, french toast, egg combos, etc. Menu items were reasonably priced but portions (especially of the hash brown sides) were on the small side. Took our waitress a while to place our orders and then to get the food out. Everything tasted good but probably won't be coming back here unless I have a whole morning to waste."}
{"text":"Easy walk from the Hilton Garden Inn. Quick, good, friendly service. We ordered the sourdough french toast for breakfast, and it was really tasty. Good coffee as well, with breakfast served until 3 PM everyday."}
{"text":"This was my favorite 1st visit to the Hotspot. The food was good, came out quick, and the waiter was friendly.  I will be back"}
{"text":"IGNORE ALL REVIEWS PRIOR TO JUNE 2017. The owner partnered with Gyro George and ruined the place. The quality food and service are history. Save yourself the frustration and go elsewhere. For example, they used to have a high quality bread for toast and now it is the thin bread that is usually reserved for prisons. That is just one of the many downgrades to the product they serve.  I was a 2-3 day a week customer."}
{"text":"Very basic diner food that is reasonably priced. When I was a student, I came in with my laptop during winter break and this was a nice trusty spot to work in CLE. Wifi is decent and free when you dine here.   The side parking lot makes it an easy spot to get to in downtown CLE."}
{"text":"Great place, especially for those staying at the Hilton Garden downtown. Affordable, clean, great service and tasty food. Went back a second time! Great alternative to the Hilton's overpriced food options."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. I ordered a gyro omelette. The gyro meat was old and hard. It was so bad we asked for the bill. The very polite server noticed we hadn't eaten and didn't charge us. We dropped a tip and left. I've never walked out of an establishment unable to eat the food."}
{"text":"Great spot to sit and chill with a coffee.  They have their own parking!! Bonus!! Free wifi Charging stations at some tables!  Nice open space.  Nicer then a typical diner  Nice staff  I had eggs/toast/bacon/home fries.  & coffee. Paid $9.16 It's a typical tasting b-fast.   However I am not a fan of the sourdough bread, which is their white toast.  Bacon is good and eggs done perfectly.   Nice regular coffee."}
{"text":"Hard too get in too. Portobello sandwich was bland, my lunch mates cream of broccoli soup was bland as well."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my recent trip to Hotspot Cafe.  For 11am on a Sunday morning it seemed too empty for the quality of service and the great breakfast!!  It started off with a big mug of great-tasting coffee plus a water with lemon and only got better when the breakfast sandwich with sausage on croissant with hashbrowns got to the table.   I like that their menu specifies they use farm and/or organic eggs. The croissant was yummy and the hashbrowns were good, cooked well and not greasy in the slightest.  I was a little disappointed the sausage patty tasted like the classic store-bought over-processed fare but that's a minor issue that didn't take away my overall enjoyment of the (quite delicious!) sandwich.   I think would be an excecllent spot to study or read in the morning/afternoons.  I'd definitely return sometime."}
{"text":"Got the Turkey Reuben, classic corned beef and chicken pesto sandwich. as a take out item. Everything was so good! Came with one side (obviously chose fries) and they came in a separate large takeout container. Could have used a little more pesto on the sandwich but great flavor regardless. Can't speak high enough about this hidden gem of Cleveland"}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth reviewing!  The breakfast food is worth eating over and over. The coffee doesn't get any better and these are the friendliest imaginable!  The people of Cleveland really need to come here to see why a California guy loves it!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food at a reasonable price. The multi-grain toast was especially good. The service was friendly and efficient.  Do yourself a favor and stop in on your way to work some morning. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"There was absolutely nothing \"hot\" about this place. The food and ambiance was mediocre at best. The menu was simple; no major options or signature/specialty items. I ordered the 333... pancakes, scrambled eggs and turkey sausage. The pancakes were over cooked and the sausage was undercooked. The only thing I can say positive about the place was that it was clean and the service was good, but I would never return unless the menu and/or cooks are changed."}
{"text":"Food average. I literally sat in my booth with 2 friends and waited 25 minutes before we could flag down a waitress. Bad service"}
{"text":"Okay, so I've been holding off on this review until I tried the actual Cronuts from a certain little bakery in New York City.  And I'd have to say, while these Cronuts were not bad, the ones in NYC are a lot better.  The ones at Hotspot are decent if you are just looking to get a Cronut experience, but they are tougher and you get a lot less of the croissant flakiness.    Also, FYI - they have a limited number, and only four flavors on weekends and two on weekdays (though this is good, considering the bakery in NYC only has one flavor per month!).  There aren't people flocking to Hotspot to get Cronuts like they do in NYC, but if you are looking to buy a dozen Cronuts you might want to call in advance to make sure they make enough for you.  I've also been here for brunch omelettes and didn't think they were very special.  I do like the charging stations at every table though."}
{"text":"As someone who lives downtown, breakfast spots are very limited outside of Ohio City and Tremont. Hot Spot definitely fills that void by offering a great simple style breakfast location to the area.   Pancakes are always a great choice, as well as anything from the other breakfast standards. The wait staff is very friendly and the place is kept extremely clean. Definitely worth checking out if visiting or looking for a Saturday morning hangover cure!"}
{"text":"Cute little brunch place in downtown Cleveland! The service was fast and the food was good! I got an omelette, which was a good size and it came with homefries that were lightly salted and crispy! My friend had a short stack of pancakes and a side of ham! The pancakes were much larger than we expected - two was more than enough for her!   The cafe is clean and simple. We had a table right next to the window - the natural light coming made the place look warm and cozy. Our waiter was quick and nice! :)"}
{"text":"Awsome great people, a comfortable clean environment, very good food, and...ready for this. ..CHARGING STATIONS at most tables for your cellphone or tablet! I LOVE this place..."}
{"text":"Nice and clean. Breakfast is very good. Service fast and friendly. Convenient to Hilton Garden Inn (walking distance) and more reasonably priced. Free parking along side if you are driving. All good things.   Only negative on our visit was computers went down and they couldn't process credit cards. Usually not an issue if you have cash, but we didn't have enough, so had to wait."}
{"text":"Great local spot! I visited for lunch while I was out of town- had a great salad.  Met the owner while I was in there- very friendly and welcoming. Would absolutely recommend this place- staff was excellent.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Clean, quiet. Limited breakfast menu, but all the basics were there! Coffee was fresh, hot and frequently replenished. Charging stations at each table and free wifi! I had the fruit & yogurt parfait, , SO had oatmeal and a fruit bowl. Both were good. May come back for pancakes before we go home."}
{"text":"Well this is it! My very first yelp review :D   The food here is delicious but ordinary (I.e. srambled eggs on buttered whole wheat toast and egg salad sandwiches with tomato and lettuce) and the prices are a little high for what you are actually getting.   The location is super convenient for GBC students and it seems to have a loyal following as the woman behind the counter knows 3/4 of the people who come in and order something."}
{"text":"For those who don't already know, this is a restaurant located near the St. Lawrence Market.  A friend had raved about the Sunday brunch she had gone to with her family. It was fair game for our try-a-new-brunch-place mission. We went on a Sunday (after Caribana) and it was busy. Not so busy that we had to wait an hour but if we had been a larger party we may have waited longer than the 10 mins we did wait. The restaurante offered ample seating with indoor and patio options. We chose to sit on the side patio (the smaller side patio).  The brunch is an all you can eat buffet style for approx. $20.00. You get your table and then you abandon it to get in a long line for your breakfast. Ok, so their aren't long lines unless...you want a freshly prepared omlet. Prepare yourself to wait 30 mins for your turn at ordering up a personalized omlet.  The rest of the offerings at the buffet didn't impress. There is a carb/pasty table to start, a waffle station that everyone seemed to be passing up, fruit, cake, omlet station, ham/fish station and  heartier lunch offerings.  Really a random assortment geared for those who aren't too picky about thier eats.   I would only recommend this place if you are a large football team."}
{"text":"Walked here for breakfast from our hotel and was extremely disappointed. I had an omelet which was not your typical omelet. It was small and the egg was thick and way overdone. The ham inside was fatty. The pancakes my husband and kids ordered were ok, but nothing special.   Service was rough as well. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good location. The free wifi is a nice little bonus. I had an omelette and coffee. The coffee was a bit weak. The fruit cup had a nice selection, but the strawberries were a bit too ripe. The omelette tasted good, but was super oily."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn next door to hotspot cafe. Was heading to Wahlburgers to grab a burger but decided to stay a little closer to the hotel due to weather and was extremely impressed! Not a big gyro guy but I ordered the jumbo gyro anyway and it was enormous! I was really hungry and still couldn't finish it all! Waiter was very friendly and food came out quick. I'm planning on going back in the AM for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is my go to to breakfast spot because of the convenience of having a parking lot. It's so easy to meet anywhere there because it is right off of the highway. My favorite meal is the breakfast wrap with egg, potato and avocado. It is unique and has a great flavor. Their service is a bit spotty."}
{"text":"Great service... nice and clean. Food is good. I was say 1 step above cafe but still welcoming"}
{"text":"Whoever picked the name for this convenient little restaurant was spot on! If it weren't for the smell of fresh gyro lamb and the serving counter, you'd guess this was a upbeat coffee shop.   Instead, Hotspot Cafe is more of a hipster-infused diner, complete with phone charging stations at every booth and some of the strongest wifi signals you can connect to. The service is good for its size and the food will knock your socks off.   Try the Cleveland special - 2 eggs, 2 fluffy pancakes and your choice of meat (I got turkey sausage). I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick breakfast or brunch in a short amount of time."}
{"text":"Stopped into Hotspot this past weekend for a late lunch.  Hotspot cafe is in the location of the old Carnegie Kitchen (which wasn't open very long itself).  They have pretty basic breakfast choices (like a Coney Island..just more pricier), with many lunch options too.  I chose the half soup/half sandwich combo- half of the \"greatest sandwich ever\" aka sandwich with ham, lettuce, mustard, etc, on a pretzel bun, and a cup of clam chowder.  The chowder came out..and was really salty. Although good size, it was a struggle to get through. The sandwich came out....cold. It would have been so much better had it just been warmed up!  However, our main purpose of stopping in? To get the CRONUT.  In the late afternoon on Saturday, the bakery items go half off! We couldn't resist.  We got the cinnamon sugar as well as the chocolate coconut. Both were DELICIOUS- sure, they're greasy, what do you expect, but they're lighter than a cake donut and tasty! Mmmmmmm.....  Would I come back here for brunch? Meh. But for the cronut? Oh yes, most definitely yes."}
{"text":"Came here after seeing so many good reviews on Yelp. Unfortunately this spot does not live up to the hype. Service was decent and fast. Breakfast food is breakfast food. Decently done with good portion size. Eggs done nicely, bacon crispy, potatoes seasoned properly. Skip the cronuts. Or at least buy them on your way out. They are cheaper to buy at the front door than ordering them while dining in. In my opinion, they were dry and stale and not worth 2.25."}
{"text":"Basic breakfast menu done well. Greek themed omelette with gyro meat. Pancakes were light and fluffy. Fast friendly service. Good local spot. Bonus- charging stations at the booths. Extra bonus- they have a charity of the month to which they donate."}
{"text":"In from Virginia for the NCAA Regional finals and Yelp helped me find this little gem. The service and food was excellent!! Home fries and blueberry pancakes were perfect. Great coffee in a large mug. Definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot! Great variety of traditional breakfast options. Great portion sizes and very good food. I expected a bit of a dive but the restaurant was updated and really nice. Service was just ok but everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"It's no lie, they have you covered on the outlets. Even USB outlets, not just a plug...WHOA!   The service was very friendly and prompt. I ordered the veggie omelet and it was a decent size, plus came with four pieces of wheat toast (my choice!) and homefries. While I'm always on the quest for finding the perfect crisp on a homefry, I'd say this still didn't match my crisp level. While they were good, they just needed a little more fry time. I also could have used a little more S & P on everything.   Glad to have this option close by our hotel for a nice breakfast before we made our way back home."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting Hotspot Cafe. The atmosphere is very modern and urban. Not what I was expecting from a diner. It was refreshing. Came on for breakfast and got the Hotspot Burrito! It was a great sized portion and tasted fantastic! It comes with a side of salsa and sour cream. The prices are very reasonable! My niece got 3 slices of French toast for only $4.99! It also comes with your choice of breakfast meat. Such a great deal. I do wish there was more of a selection for breakfast but other than that it was fantastic! Do not hesitate to come here if you're visiting the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"Great food. Little bit of a wait but worth it.  Had the hot spot breakfast burrito with gyro meat.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Cleveland en route to New York.  It's roughly halfway between Chi and NYC so it's a decent spot.  We looked around Yelp and found Hotspot Cafe. This place was a short walk from our hotel and it was a nice place.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  We were able to order a mickey mouse pancake off the menu for the little one.  We definitely appreciated that and so did she. The free wifi was a good addition.  I got an omelette which I enjoyed very much.  If I go back to Cleveland I will definitely go back here."}
{"text":"The Hotspot Cafe is a bit of a weird joint. It's all very dated, and kind of looks like a little sandwich counter you'd see at an airport in Newfoundland. This description doesn't make sense? Alright, well fly into Deer Lake and get back to me.   I was rushing between meetings and was on a block with not much else in sight, so I turned in here. I had 10 minutes where I could comfortably sit and eat, so naturally I ordered their pasta and meatball special. Luckily, my stupid order didn't get in my way. It was kept warm in the back, because it was out in under two minutes, and it was actually really tasty.   In a pinch I'd definitely grab a quick bite here... but probably not at the airport in NFLD again. That place wasn't so hot."}
{"text":"I came here because I had a gift card. I ordered breakfast to go and it was ready on time and delicious, but not accurate to what I asked for. I ended up getting double bacon (no potatoes) so really who's going to go back to complain? (I mean,  extra bacon). I wouldn't go here for reasons other than how convenient it is (free parking lot right next door), and somewhat reasonably priced food downtown. When I lived downtown there weren't many places to get breakfast but I feel like that has changed, this place is surviving because the food price is reasonable, quality is pretty good, and the location is great -- and that easy free parking!!!!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time in NYC, a donut and a croissant walked into a bar. One thing led to another and the donut was knocked up by the end of the night. 9 months later, Chef Ansel delivered the exciting and delectable hybrid of the two and named it the Cronut (trademarked it actually, so the rest of the review will refer to this version as the C-D since I'm too lazy to type out the croissant-doughnut).   So, CD's have been popping up everywhere now, but I had yet to find one in Cleveland. THEN, I came across the menu for Hotspot the other day and they ever-so-subtly listed CDs under their pastry menu!! So, I headed over there today to check it out (and to grab lunch). There's a chance I may be the only one that was SO excited about the CD b/c the waitress was taken-aback by my enthusiasm when she confirmed they had CDs in the display case.   ANYWAYS, the cafe itself is cute. It's spacious and nicely spread out. There are a ton of booths along the walls and in the middle and tables that fill the rest. EVERY booth has a charging station!! AMAZING!! I ordered the Caprese grill on sourdough bread with fries. The turnaround time between me ordering my food and actually receiving my food was NOT EVEN 10 minutes. They were amazingly fast! I'm used to caprese sandwiches with Mozz, but tried this one anyway b/c who doesn't love provolone- the sandwich was DELISH. Whatever pesto they use for it was crazy flavorful. The sourdough bread tasted like italian bread - so, not sure if their sourdough just doesn't taste like sourdough or if they swapped the breads by mistake.   THE CD'S- soooo, as excited as I was for these, I had a bite of them when I got home and ALTHOUGH DELICIOUS, they were pretty dry. I'm really hoping it's because I was there at 1:30pm and they may have been sitting out in the case all day. I really home they're softer earlier in the day b/c they are DEF delish.   Service was quick. In the beginning, the waitress was kind of short and kept acting like she had to run somewhere else instead of answering my questions- I could have very well scared her with my CD enthusiasm - but she warmed up and wasn't in that much of a rush after my food was put in.   PS they DO serve breakfast throughout the day. I originally wanted to order bfast food but was only given a lunch menu so assumed they didn't serve it anymore, and later found out that they just don't hand out the menu after a certain time. Next time.  I KNOW i'm going to have a love-hate relationship with this place. It opens at 7am and is right on my way to work.... soooo, i'm going to LOVE stopping and grabbing breakfast OR CDs on my way in but i'm going to HATE what it does to my diet.  --  4 days later- went back in the AM for a croissant donut and it was soft and yummy :) def not as dry! and their breakfast is delish!! (got carry-out this time- veggie skillet with egg whites YUM)"}
{"text":"Don't let the fact that market themselves as a an internet cafe turn you off. I'm not sure why they do that. Sure they have WiFi. But doesn't everyone have WiFi. Its at least 2015 (depending on when you are reading this review).   This place is just a nice diner. The breakfast food was actually very good. Its very standard, but thats what everyone in our party wanted and thats what this place delivered. It was almost empty on a Sunday around noon. I assume because of the location? We walked from the Hotel Garden Inn as we are out of town guests, and it was maybe 200 yards away?  While we were there, the ceiling was leaking in maybe ten places. Its still a nice place; they just need to fix the ceiling. Nobody got wet, and if anything the effect of so many leaks was an entertaining fountain show while we ate. Not quite the Bellagio, but it stimulated conversation.  Hopefully its fixed by the time you go!"}
{"text":"Im not really sure why this place has good reviews. The staff was friendly but that is the only highlight I am giving. The food wasn't bad, it was just average nothing special for me. Prices were ok, but I've eaten better quality food for the same cost. If you're looking for an affordable brunch in downtown, this isn't the place you should go. Service was great, but the food was bland. If you're looking for diners like Denny's, this is your place."}
{"text":"Awesome spot in a perfect location. Cleveland has been needing a solid diner location since a few of them closed recently and this place seals the deal for me. I absolutely love that they have free parking AND free wifi- yep! You heard me right, free parking and free wifi. How many places in downtown gateway district can say the same?  I came in early in the morning before a dentist appointment and was surprised to find how spacious and cozy this restaurant is! I could see this being an awesome work lunch or meeting spot. What's even better is that the food came up incredibly fast, I'm talking 5 minutes fast. I almost didn't know what to do with myself with all the extra time I hadn't anticipated having. The food is diner style, nothing fancy, but that's what I love about it. The coffee was better than I expected and the server was great with keeping those java refills coming. I don't have really any criticisms of this place, if I'm being really picky, they do call themselves a \"healthy\" cafe, but I would argue that there really aren't many truly healthy options on the menu, this doesn't bother me though, if you want avocado on toast you can go to one of the many hipster cafes that offer it, this place serves up simple food quickly and with great service. Considering the location, I'd say you get more than you bargain for!"}
