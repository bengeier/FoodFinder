{"text":"The roast pork, especially when fresh, is one of the best in GTA. However the char siu is often dry and overcooked/rough, The ducks skin is abit soggy compared to sam woos crisp skin duck.  The older short grandma....yeah shes the \"you hurry up and buy\" type of service, shes always rudely yelling at customers lol One time I've made a small request, no hoisin sauce for my roast pork, but gravy on it. She said NO, you have to use hoisin for roast pork.    I avoid this place when shes serving.  Also I noticed with ordering rice combo dishes...they give waaay less meat and more rice than they did compared to months ago. A new strategy for profit I suppose."}
{"text":"Delicious! One of the best deals I have found in Toronto. Got a plate of roast and bbq pork with rice, bok choi, and a soup for $6.50. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ for great prices! Tucked away in the Chinatown Mall (Sino Mall?), the service was friendly and the BBQ pork was excellent. Their sauce is also great! Would definitely return to try the duck, fried pork, and squid!"}
{"text":"For 5.25 to 7,25, you get a full meal with BBQ Pork and/or Roast Pork and/or BBQ Duck with veggies and rice. The hot tea is free. Pop is regularly prices.  I usually forgo the included soup, not my thing. Otherwise, excellent little lunch / dinner spot for the $.  Its not double tree or sam woos, but for the price, good to go."}
{"text":"Good BBQ Pork!  Lunch specials are the best value in the West end for Chinese BBQ.  Gonna try their roast pork next.  Looks like they roast it in house since I saw a couple whole hogs hanging in the back."}
{"text":"you best come early on Vietnamese or Chinese new year cause every asian and their neighbor be wanting a nice roast piggie. Dirt cheap for a shit ton of rice and it comes with a soup. My mom would pond me off in this tiny food court ever since I was wee small while she did her groceries. I love me some liver but they sell out quick so come early."}
{"text":"Luen Hing Barbecue is located in the food court of the Mississauga Chinese Centre (a.k.a. Sino Mall).  Like I mentioned in another review, the food court at the Mississauga Chinese Centre is like a much smaller, dirtier and sadder version of the food court at First Markham Place.  It's all independent vendors, no big name chains.     I went here with my parents and we got food from different vendors and then shared.  At Luen Hing Barbecue we got a Peking Duck and Roast Pork with rice place ($6.95).  It also came with a free soup (which was just broth).    The roast pork was tender and lean.  The skin was crispy.  The Peking duck was nice although the skin was not all that crispy.  The plate also came with bok choy and steamed rice.  My dad loved this dish.  I thought it was ok.  I'm not a huge roast pork or Peking duck fan though.  No real complaints, but I was not wowed."}
{"text":"Really good roast pork.  Best roast duck around.  Great meals too for $6 - meat, rice, veggies, and soup.  Just go do it!!!!"}
{"text":"This little stall has been here for 20+ years so it's gotta be decent right?  Yep, definitely.  Their BBQ pork is tasty but I really like their roast pork.  The skin is so crispy.  Yummers.   However, all they really have is BBQ items and rice and nothing else.  3/5  What I really like is their prices though.  It looked like most one item dishes with rice are 5.50 and two item combos are 6.50.  Verdict: if you want a quick meal, great takeout."}
{"text":"Great quality Asian BBQ hidden in a mall. Their bento box isn't entirely perfect; the vegetables are simple and the rice is flaky, but the tasty tender meat more than makes up for the simpleness. Everything tastes good, it's just not entirely refined. They also give you a soup/broth that completes your meal. For only $7.00 it's an amazing deal and will fill up a hungry person.  The meats are nicely marinated. Ive seen better roast pork, but it could be due to the \"end of the day\" cuts. They were out of duck, so make sure to come earlier in the day if that's what you'd prefer.  The mall itself is unrenovated, but there is a seating area as it is mostly a food court. The atmosphere felt a bit awkward, so I didn't care for sitting in. Definitely check out what the other food places have to offer too, as they feel like an extension of eachother which I found interesting."}
{"text":"Quite impressed with this place. I discovered Luen Hing Barbecue inside the food court of Mississauga Chinese Center. Owner were nice. I ordered the Roasted Pork Rice. It was one of the best Roasted Pork I've ever had! Large portion, comes with veggies and soup for an unbeatable price. It's nothing fancy, but very satisfying for sure. It's the most popular place in the Food Court."}
{"text":"$4.99 for Today's Specials with a few different options to choose, and the portions are great. Authentic, salty, Chinese BBQ. If that's what you want, you will not be disappointed, and you won't break the bank either."}
{"text":"Really solid places for barbecue pork. Prices are great and the meat is incredibly succulent. Prices are also fair and probably the best value in the food court."}
{"text":"It's a must try I eat here all the time I love the food and very good price were can you get a full meal for under $10 today"}
{"text":"Cheap and good chinese bbq fast food restaurant located in the Sino Chinese mall! Typical of these types of restaurants, they offer excellent value. Under $6 for a loaded plate with 2 kinds on meat, tons of rice, veggies, soup and a hot cup of tea!  Cannot be beat for value."}
