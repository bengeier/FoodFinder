{"text":"One of the best vietnamese restaurant in vaughan and I am vietnamese. Try it out, i am sure if you like true vietnamese food then you will love the fresh ingredients. Tommy"}
{"text":"Excellent food. I have the dry noodle w the soup separate, one of the best I have so far. The beef salad is also authentic.  Strongly endorse for you to try."}
{"text":"Amazing broth. A lot of care goes into the preparation of their food. My favourite Vietnamese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Super hot yummy clear broth.  Pho is a la dente.  Only if more meat is given will be even better.   Rice cake first deep fried then pan fried with egg and greens.  Tasted different and good.  Egg is cooked just right. Service is good. Chef dressed in Asian chef  uniform, very clean.  Claimed to be authentic Vietnamese food as though  you are in Vietnam.   Definitely  will come back"}
{"text":"I'm a big pho lover but was disappointed when I didn't see tripe or tendon on the menu.  This place has a very few selection of pho bowls, so don't expect to see the same variety as other pho places.    When the bowls arrived we asked which was which to confirm we received the correct order. The order was confirmed by the waitress. During dinner I found their brisket was all fat and they only gave me 2 flank pieces.  Definitely not worth the price.  Also their hoisin sauce tasted like a lesser quality brand which was also watered down.  Then when the bill came we found they charged us for two orders of B3 pho bowls which were more expensive than what we ordered. For some reason the waitress didn't want to recognize her mistake, it seemed like she did it on purpose so I had to ask for the menu to show her exactly what we ordered.  In addition, after we paid, the chef asked if I was done with the sprouts which I replied yes, then he says that I wasted it!!  It was very rude to make that remark then march away with the plate of sprouts.  I guess he was planning to reuse the sprouts for the next table.  Hence I will not be returning to this cheap restaurant.    Word of advice, confirm your order and check your bill so you're not getting ripped off."}
{"text":"The spring rolls was soggy inside,oil oozing out. The pho was bland with no beef smell or taste. I got the beef noodle soup and I tasted chicken stock  instead of beef stock no joke! Got around 6 pieces of rare thin beef in my small pho. I would love to support these mom and pop restaurant but when they are stingy on the soup itself that's not acceptable! I don't mind  paying a little more because I do know making the soup with all of the ingredients and the condiments will come out to about 3.50 to 4 dollars per bowl wholesale price. Now who ever that  wants a $6 pho(retail price) doesn't understand or the taste of pho...that price is 10 years ago not today... everything has gone up! Pho with all the right ingedients are very hearty and healthy for you. Their price for pho is on the low end and unfortunately their pho is also on the low end. I feel like those peeps saying this place has good quality don't know shit!"}
{"text":"2nd time at this fairly new family owned Vietnamese Pho restaurant! :)   I remember being impressed by Chef Anh when he took the time to explain how there is a difference between Northern style traditional Vietnamese cooking and Southern style. This time around I am still impressed, and his passion really shows. Utilizing the Northern style, Anh cooks the broth of the Chicken Pho separately from the meat to ensure the most distinct natural flavours.   I find that the soup base is tasty but not too salty nor oily. I also noticed that he does not use bean sprouts with the Pho! And of course he took the time to explain precisely why~ But I will let you find out when you decide to visit Pho Anh yourself!  Will definitely be coming back again to try their other foods! Pho Anh is a unique character in a plaza of 5 different Vietnamese Pho restaurants!"}
{"text":"After a long drive back from the states, i found myself passing a nearby Chatime, so I stopped into Pho Anh for a quick dinner before satisfying my tea addiction.  Quite a mom and pop operation, Pho Anh is nicely decorated, nothing excessive, and certainly not dumpy like the other half of the Asian restaurants across the GTA.  I ordered a bowl of pho with rare beef and beef brisket, and a spring roll for a bit of a trial.  The soup was flavourful, with a decent helping of meat, and lots of tender rice noodles.  The spring roll was especially good.  I rarely find good spring rolls, especially since having one of the best in Times Square in Richmond Hill.  This roll was incredibly crisp, a bit oily, but overall very enjoyable.  There are several Asian restaurants in the complex, but I think I might make this one my anchor."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite Vietnamese restaurant. I've been here last week and came back this week again. Pho Anh is a fairly new restaurant in the Vaughan area, clean, great menu with nice professional food pictures taken by the chef/owner himself. Food was excellent both time. The chef was very nice and came out and talked to us about his passion in cooking clean and authentic food with quality ingredients. All that passion and knowledge certainty reflect in every bite taken of his food. I highly recommend their Pho and the dry Hu Tieu noodle with the soup on the side, which is the best I've ever had! I will surely come back again and try other items in their menu. Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant expecting to have a great bowl of pho. Looked at the menu only to discover 3 types of beef pho and a few chicken pho selections. Sorry but when you have the word pho in you restaurant name that should be your specialty with a variety of options.  I decided to get the B2 beef pho option. The soup came in very hot which is how it should always arrive. The taste of the soup was very clean however there wasn't much beef in the bowl. The price for the bowl was $7.49 however I was charged for the B3 price at $7.99. They fixed the price after I informed the waitress.   The hoi sin sauce was not the normal sauce used in 95% of pho restaurants. That was a huge disappointment for me. The hot sauce tasted like the regular rooster brand tho.  Overall I left the restaurant not satisfied at all. I will not be coming to this place for pho again and I suggest you go elsewhere if you have pho cravings."}
{"text":"Food is quite tasty and clean.  The establishment is nice with nice service.  The summer rolls taste great with the peanut sauce and the beef flank/round eye pho was just right with the soup and not too 'oily'.   Different types of sauces to help mix things up."}
{"text":"We happened to find this small Pho restaurant when we were driving around the plaza.  This is a small restaurant with an open kitchen concept and limited tables but comfortable.  There was only one server and two chefs in the kitchen.  There weren't too many people when we went in so we got our table right away.  It was around lunch hour so many people came in after we got seated.  I got the grilled pork chop with steam rice and it was really tasty.  We also got the iced coffee with condense milk, which was really good.    I'm not giving it 5 stars because of the wait time.  It took almost 20 minutes before we got our food and those who arrived after us got their orders first.  Because there was only one server, one of the chefs delivered our food because we waited too long.  I don't mind coming back because the food was really good!  Note: There's a separate washroom for men and women, but it is really clean and big compared to other Pho restaurants."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Pho Anh. I went with my husband and son on a Sunday afternoon (around 1pm) and it was quite busy, with only 1 free table. We were seated as soon as we walked in and given menus.  Unlike at most Vietnamese restaurants in the area, we were each given a cup of tea as opposed to a whole pot. The reason I'm mentioning this is because about halfway through lunch, my cup was empty and it took me a good 10 minutes to flag someone down to have it refilled.  The dining room is fairly small, but they've packed in as many tables as possible without it looking too cramped.  The menu is no way near as extensive as most Vietnamese restaurants we frequent, but there are still some interesting options.   My husband had lemongrass beef and onion on vermicelli. He said it was really tasty and was a fair portion. My son had a grilled pork chop with rice and also really enjoyed it. I (by mistake) ordered Hanoi style vermicelli with grilled pork belly and pork meatballs. I say it was by mistake because I assumed I would be getting the usual vermicelli with lots of veggies and herbs, topped with grilled meat. However, it was served very differently and after looking it up online, I realise I actually stumbled upon a popular dish that I hadn't known about. This for me was very exciting since we've been eating at Vietnamese restaurants twice weekly for more than 15 years. So this dish was served with the meat actually IN the nuoc cham (sweet and sour dipping sauce) so that the meat soaked all of those flavours in as if it was a marinade. There were also lots of slices of carrot and daikon floating in the sauce. The herbs were served on the side and they were plentiful. There were also lots of large pieces of lettuce and the vermicelli was served on the side as well. Using my instincts (this very well may have been waaaay off) I used the lettuce as a wrap to enclose pieces of meat, some herbs and some vermicelli. Whether or not this was the right way to eat it, it was a very tasty dish and they were quite generous with the meat.  We also shared some deep fried spring rolls to start and they were quite good. I like that they were wrapped in a rice wrapper (as they should be) as opposed to a wheat wrapper.  All in all, we enjoyed our meal and will probably return to try another few dishes."}
{"text":"Another new Vietnamese restaurant just opened up a few weeks ago right across from Vaughan Mills.  The decoration here is nice and chic. You won't be entertained by CP24 while you wait for your food but instead you will be listening to soothing instrumental music.  Open Kitchen concept and with a really socialable chef who even come out from the kitchen serving the food and talking to the customers. But I was here on an afternoon for late lunch.  Summer Roll ($3.49) and Pho with Rare Eye Round, Flank, Brisket, Balls and Tendon ($7.99) both exceptional well prepared using good quality ingredients. The dipping sauce was served warm with a tangy taste of apple wih hoisin sauce. The pho topping: especially the flank and tendon were just melt in your mouth soft.   Price is though relatively high for the smaller portion but you really paying for the quality.  I will be back to try Chef's Special Phnom Penh Noodle Soup or maybe even Angus Steak Vietnamese Style next time. And even a Flan Cake for dessert.  Btw, the Chef is also a great photographher as all the photos in the menu is taken by him!"}
{"text":"There's a lot of competition for Vietnamese food in this plaza in front of Vaughan Mills mall and I'm glad I came here. The interior is very modern, nice decor, and bright. There are plenty of tables, so we didn't have to wait. The menu isn't extensive like some other places, but that's okay because it made choosing what to order easier.  We ordered the fried rice cakes for a starter and I ordered the Phnom Penh noodle soup with the soup in the noodles. They can also prepare this with the soup separately, which one in our party ordered. When you order the soup separately, the soup comes with a huge beef bone for flavoring, and the noodles have some brown sauce. I really enjoyed the noodle soup with the soup combined with the noodles. I thought the broth was amazing! I drank the whole thing. The broth is not like at other pho restaurants, because there isn't as much star anise or salt. The noodle soup includes medium-sized pieces of minced pork, 2 shrimps, pork liver, and slices of pork. This is some of the best noodle soup I've ever tasted.  The fried rice cakes were also really tasty. The rice cakes were nice and crispy and covered in cooked egg. However, there was some egg that was uncooked that I had to remove.  Overall, amazing food. A must try if you're in the area."}
