{"text":"a little expensive, but the food is great! I could eat Jim's dogs with sauce and cheese all day every day."}
{"text":"Really good burgers and fries. Hope it stays around forever. My only criticism would be the prices are very high but that's it, really good food."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs in west mifflin. They have a great staff and friendly workers I recommend people to go try it out"}
{"text":"One of the best hot dog place. Many choices of condiments, famous for their sauce. They toast the buns."}
{"text":"Unless you grew up with this place (which I didn't), it's not really worth going to.  It's out of my way, but so is the Red Caboose on route 51, which is much better.  

Don't get me wrong, the hot dogs are pretty good, but they're pretty expensive for what you get.  Jim's secret sauce is pretty good too, but not enough to keep me coming back.  I probably wouldn't even dislike the place, except that the french fries are horrible.  It didn't look like they fried them at all.  And they were burnt, so they had to have been baked at some point.  If I want crappy baked fries, I have an oven at home for that.  I go out to get real fried french fries.

So unless you have some sort of sentimental attachment to this place, I'd pass."}
{"text":"Love the food especially the burgers n fries. The shakes are ok. They are pretty fast at making the food."}
{"text":"The sauce is very unique.  I ate a cheese dog and a regular dog.  Both were really good but the melted cheese covering the dog and the sauce was realllllly, really good.  The toasted buns was another thing that set these dogs apart from what I'm used to and had before.  The fries were nothing to write home about and there were some that were really crispy and perfect and other that were some what soggy so there was some inconsistency there.  I was January so I had to eat inside of my car, but I can see that on a summer night or a spring day being able to eat outside would be really great."}
{"text":"There's nothing like Jim's famous sauce. I've bought it in the bottle, but it's nothing like the real deal when you're there. If you're going to splurge on your diet, get a milk shake, too. Nothing like topping off a hot dog, cheese and sauce with a chocolate shake."}
{"text":"Their food and shakes are incredible! There's simply no justification for charging someone $3+ for a regular sized hotdog though, no matter how good it is. I guess there's a reason why the owner walks around with 10lbs of gold on. I mean, he's been robbing people for 40 years! I would recommend that someone tap into their 401k to buy a few hotdogs from this place."}
{"text":"I have been going to Jim's since i was able to eat. The sauce is amazing. The guys are nice and don't write anything down but they get every order right. If i could give them a ten i would."}
{"text":"Jim's is my favorite place in all the land.  Honestly.  When I get married there won't be a cookie table... it'll be a Jim's dog table.

The official name may now be \"Jim's Famous Sauce,\" but my family still calls it Jim's Drive-In.  My parents came here, their parents came here, and now I come here any chance I get.   I have fond memories of my Pap coming home with boxes of dogs for everyone, topped with a range of goodies, and maybe even a few yummy milkshakes to wash it all down with.

When the weather is nice, I like to drive up here and sit outside and just enjoy the neighborhood while I inhale my food and the intoxicating smell that wafts from this hallowed temple of deliciousness. Their kielbasa sandwich gets rave reviews from my boyfriend, but my absolute favorite is a Jim's dog with sauce, onions, and cheese. Make it two (or three)!  They take credit cards now which is both awesome and dangerous.  Grab a bottle of the sauce to take home! It does taste a bit different than the stuff at the restaurant, but it's a secret recipe after all!  Toss it on a home-grilled dog and throw it under the broiler for a few mins... good as gold.

My only complaint is that I wrote this review on an empty stomach and I'm at least 45 minutes away from Jim's."}
{"text":"Between 3 and 4 stars, leaning 4.  Very good for a hot dog joint.  If it was compared against only hot dog joints, it would be 5.  Good local place with different flavors, reasonably priced and comfortable."}
{"text":"We went on a little cruise last night since it was so nice out. We ended up in the back of west Mifflin. I did a yelp search of food in the area and jims showed up. It was our first time here and we really enjoyed it!

my bf ordered a cheese dog, burger and chocolate shake. I went with a ham bbq and fries. My bf's food looked amazing.. especially the cheese dog. The burger was also a nice size. we ate at a picnic table that they offered. the shake was also good. 

I personally was not a fan of ham bbq. the Pittsburgh way to cook a ham bbq is let the ham slow cook in the bbq sauce. Jims sandwich was just slices of deli ham cooked on the grill then topped with their signature sauce. the sauce is good but sandwich was upsetting honestly. shoe string fries were basic too. would love homemade fries guys!

next time i'll stick to their burgers, hot dogs and shakes. those are all winners. I wanted to do 3 star review bc of my underwhelming sandwich, but honestly we really enjoyed our time here. it will be a new summer staple for us!"}
{"text":"There have been many food options that were staples in my diet in Buffalo that I was surprised were not regulars in Pittsburgh.  Hot dog stands is one of them.  After complaining about not having them here, a coworker directed me to Jim's and said I had to try it.  It is out of the way so it took me a while to finally get there, but I am glad we did!  

They have hot dogs, burgers and chicken, but you'd be foolish to not get a hot dog.  Make sure you get it with sauce, pickles and cheese.  SOOOOOOO good!  

There is table seating but note that it is picnic tables and they are not covered.

They also have a variety of milkshakes.  I tried the root beer and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Their hot dogs and burgers are decent, but I really liked their fries and ice cream, though. The famous sauce is nothing to get excited about. It's in a weird location, a converted house and has been there for decades. It's hidden in the middle of a residential area."}
{"text":"Hot dog itself was good but \"famous\" sauce reminded me of watered down baked beans minus the beans topped with extra fancy american cheese all for about 4 bucks a piece....not even close to what I expected"}
{"text":"My crazy boss goes on tangents sometimes, anything from politics, religion, to food. The only time I really listen is when he talks about food.

Man, was he spot on about Jim's. \"Oh, Eryn, do you like hot dogs?\" He says in his silly accent. Uhh, duh. \"You've gotta try Jim's\". I'm so glad he told me about this awesome little spot. 

Out with the gang on a Wednesday before work, we stopped at Jim's and I got what my date was getting, sauce and cheese. (The crazy boss suggested onion and pepper, but I work in close proximity to other humans, and I prefer to not offend them.) Everything my boss described was spot on. The sauce (to me) was like a weird Arby's sauce, but so much better. The dog was done well and the cheese was just a little bit burned. Good addition. I am hooked. Hopefully I'll be back again this summer to try something different! 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Good dog!  Great sauce! Will definitely visit again and next time with the family. They could use more seating"}
{"text":"Note #1: The official name of the business is Jim's Famous Sauce.

http://www.jimsfamoussauce.com

Note #2: Credit cards are now accepted. 

Note #3: JIm's has no indoor seating. One can either eat in their vehicle in the parking lot or at a canopied table. Take-out is also available. Bakery boxes are used for this purpose, which I've always found nifty for some reason (is it the association with donuts?). 

Credit Yelp, specifically Yelena K, for bringing this venerable business, one that's been hidden in a Pittsburgh suburb for 65 years, to my attention. Ever since reading Yelena's review, I had been prickling to come here. A co-worker who lives in the area only excited my imagination further with his anecdotes. 

Jim's tale begins in McKeesport, 1927. Tsambikos \"Jim\" Damianos had arrived on American shores a number of years earlier as a twentysomething from the isle of Greece, and after tiring of working for others in various blue-collar positions around Pittsburgh and elsewhere, he opened the first incarnation of Jim's in a former house on Walnut Street. A shade over 2 decades later, Jim's would be relocated to its current space in a sleepy, residential portion of West Mifflin. 

Yeah. Betcha thought West Mifflin was nothing but Century III Mall, chain restaurants, and shopping centers, didn't ya? I did too, not realizing how sprawling the area is and how some parts of it are downright tranquil compared to the madness of Clairton Boulevard. After driving a bit out of our way (a monthly Wal-Mart visit was our excuse for coming out here...go figure...) and damn near hitting Dravosburg (Kay doesn't always pay attention to her GPS), we came across Jim's, abruptly I might add, so much so that we were grateful no one was tailgating the Kaymobile. I had been expecting a shack in the middle of a gravel lot, but what we found was something that resembled a cozy, modest home with a storefront in place of a porch and a manicured, fenced-in backyard. 

As I alluded to earlier, the bedrock of Jim's is this arcane, auburn sauce that touches upon tomato sauce, BBQ sauce, and catsup in composition, and according to the advertising can be used in place of any of those condiments. What it tastes like, however, is...well, nothing...until that spice slowly creeps up on the tongue, leaving a burn that rises then descends.

Famous? Perhaps. It took buying a bottle and tasting it by its lonesome via butterknife to truly appreciate it. Having it on a hot dog with grilled onions and peppers had me wondering if my palate was out-of-order for the evening. 

Speaking of which, Jim's utilizes Smith's brand hot dogs which are grilled and later broiled while in the bun, creating a uniquely crisp texture and juicier, more savory flavor. This is especially true when one orders a \"cheesedog\" as I did (hot dogs are generally a twofer proposition for me). The cheese is laid down in flaps as opposed to shredded piles, and when broiled, develops a mildly charred crust. 

Burgers are handled in the same manner, and mine (blame hunger) was basically the spawn of a Steak 'n Shake burger and an Eat 'n Park Superburger with its moist flattened patty. L-T-M fan that I am, I was initially dismayed that I couldn't ideally customize my burger, so I settled for cheese, diced fresh onion, and that weird sauce I'm sure not everyone likes (I'm not even sure I like it). A Kaiseresque roll was a interesting and welcome wrinkle. 

Jim's also serves up milkshakes and the fundamental ice cream flavors in hard-serve form. I doubt Jim's makes their own ice cream, but whatever brand of chocolate this was, I'd like to know (Breyer's?), since it was rather tasty on a temperate, overcast August evening in a typically communion wafer-ish \"cake\" cone. 

The service was friendly as well as appreciative. The trouble is, I don't know if I appreciate Jim's enough to rate it higher than a 4, and I'm almost reluctant to go that far. Jim's sauce may not have totally captured my heart and stomach, but dagnabbit if I don't like the way they do dawgs, man. That sauce? Keep it. Just gimme the toasty cheese-coated franks. 

So yeah. A 4, dude. May Jim's merely be a quaint neighborhood secret no longer. 

What to do with that bottle of sauce, though? Eh, Kay did buy some chicken at the Megalomart...

P.S. Jim's pencil-thick, fresh-cut (? I saw skin on them there tater sticks) french fries were not duff in anyway, either.

P.P.S. The prices, while understandably high to some, are pretty much in line with the big fast food chains these days, and heck, I'd much rather be eating Jim's food than The Clown's as should you."}
{"text":"Jim's hot dog is to Pittsburgh what the cheesesteak is to Philly. When you go to the counter, know what you want, don't mess around, and for the love of God, DO NOT ASK THEM TO MIX THE FAMOUS SAUCE WITH KETCHUP. It's a one or the other proposition. While much yes, it looks like it was drained from a can of pork and beans, don't let that put you off, it is unique and extremely delicious. I love the way they broil cheese on top of the hotdogs, and the cherry limeade is excellent."}
{"text":"My fiancé's dad grew up here.  When he was little, he spent a summer with his grandparents, who would take him here for hot dogs.  He hasn't stopped talking about this place since I met him!  So of course, when making the cross-country drive to move to New York, we had to make a detour!  Only 15 miles off the 70?  Um, yes, please.  Well this 15-mile detour turned into a 2-HOUR detour going up the steep and narrow mountain roads and then back down to the freeway.  

Was it worth it?  You betcha.  The bun... oh the bun.  So toasty, so crispy around the edges.  It actually holds up the hot dog and doesn't fall apart after each bite.  The hot dog... hefty, flavorful, so delicious.  And the sauce!  Just perfect, ties everything together and adds an extra punch.  

He keeps asking me where I want to move next and I just keep saying, \"Jim's!\"  I don't know why he keeps laughing.  I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.  No hot dog will ever compare!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Best hotdogs, burgers, and nachos around!  A bit expensive, but worth it.  The sauce makes all the difference."}
{"text":"If you are in the area, this is a good quick stop.  It is a drive-in with some picnic tables that were all in use on our visit.  The menu has dogs, kielbasa, burgers and a few other options along with a great hand dipped ice cream milkshake.  I just had Jim's special dog.  The dogs are good and the sauce and cheese added a great flavor. The dogs are grilled then put in a broiler to toast the cheese.  The sauce is a little sweet, smoky with a little spiciness.  
The sauce is also sold in bottles.
The strawberry shake was thick with a lot of strawberry flavor came with some whipped cream and a cherry on top.
So if you are in the area looking for a good dog or burger or sandwich, stop by and indulge."}
{"text":"My brother lived right over the hill from Jim's and every time I would visit, i made sure Jim's was part of my visit, as well. Their hot dogs are so good- the way they melt the cheese on top of the bun to seal in the secret sauce- perfect!! I could eat about 10 of them :)"}
