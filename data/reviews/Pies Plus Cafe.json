{"text":"Love this place! Brings back wonderful memories of when my sis, mom and I would come here on our PD days. Great food, great service, great pies and everything in between!"}
{"text":"I tried one if their pies called something like \"dream cream\". It was a mix between cheesecake and whipped cream topped with berry pie filling. It was absolutely incredible and is my favorite pie to this day!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about Pies Plus Cafe and wanted to try it for myself. It is a small cafe shop where they make all their pie and offer a few tables to sit. They also offer sandwiches and soup as well. When I got there, there were no pie or dessert on display and they only had a few pies left to purchases by the slice. Each slice of pie cost $5.95. I got an apple pie and Chocolate coconut pie. The crust for both pies were very good! The stuffing in my apple pie was a bit sour for my tasting and the chocolate coconut stuffing was not too sweet and pretty good. For the price it is a bit small but I am glad i gave it a try."}
{"text":"I ordered a Cherry Saskatoon pie and a large latte. The pie slice was pretty big! It was about 3/8 of a 9 inch pie. The filling was delicious :) It was a bit sour, pretty tangy, but no overly sweet. It was quite easy to finish, and I could have ate another half slice of the same pie :) The filling was very smooth with no hints of graininess. Whole berries with skins were used, which added a bit of chewiness to the filling. Each bite was a burst of juicy flavor. In fact, I did  dribble a little bit. LOL! It was that juicy!  The crust of the pie was thick, a bit heavy and flaky. It was fully baked, so there were not chewy unbaked pieces - yay! I would have preferred if it was baked a few minutes longer - it might have added a flakier texture to the pie. The coffee was a bit of a disappointment. It was a bit watery, so any nuances in the espresso was easily missed. The flavour was smoky and woody, with very low acidity - no happy tingling on my tongue. It was definitely a coffee you need to dress up with chocolate or syrups.  In conclusion, I would definitely recommend grabbing a slice of pie! If you're looking for just coffee, be prepared to dress up your drink."}
{"text":"Nice service but that is about it! The sandwiches are a complete joke not even worth to mention! The quiche is an insult to french cooking, all you can taste is a crumbly sandy crust with egg with no seasoning whatsoever and then imagine that reheated in a microwave! Salt and pepper are not the enemy! Been there, done that....moving on"}
{"text":"I have eaten many a pie in my life including the wonderful pies my mother used to make.  I have had pies plus pies and they are fine.  Unless made by morons or hockey players pies are generally good.  So why does pies plus SUCK???  It's the little things.  I entered the address into google maps and it took me into an endless loop of NOT getting there.  Next day after the frustration wore off tried Apple maps and was taken to a nearby location where pies plus WASN'T!!!  Called pies plus and it was picked up by a voice message WAY TOO GARBLED for me to understand.  Called my mom and she gave me directions and it was not far and when I arrived it was closed Monday.  I imagine if the message wasn't too garbled I may have found out about the Monday closed.  THIS IS 2017 not even NOT EVEN HAIRDRESSERS ARE CLOSED MONDAYS ANYMORE. There guys don't deserve customers.

{"text":"I simple little cafe bakery selling simple things. Great muffins!! Excellent americano. Big mugs and pleasant service. In avenida and need a coffee or a break. Go there!!"}
{"text":"I stumbled into this place after a blood test @ the nearby clinic. I was mungry as heck and when I saw the Pies+ sign, I quickly dashed over, shoving any innocent bystander that came across my way.  The decor of the place had a homely feel to it, like you were being invited to a restaurant someone's sweet granny ran. But I was blown away by the pie selection of the place but was unable to get any frozen pies to go. However, I settled for beef stew and a broccoli quiche. The prices were a bit steep, but the meal was very filling and delicious. The pie crust on the stew was amazing, it was soft, flaky, and buttery. The stew had a small serving but was packed with meaty flavour and didn't skimp on the meaty goodness that was required to replenish my low hemoglobin supply. The quiche was just as delicious and I loved how moist and cheesy the filling was."}
{"text":"I got the broccoli and cauliflower quiche and a piece of apple pie. It was a bit pricey for the size I got, a little bit over 10$ a piece for the quiche. The quiche wasn't anything impressive, a bit bland for my tastes and the crust not crispy enough. The pie on the other hand was delicious, would rate it 4/5, not the best pie I've ever had but pretty darn good.  I really like the homely feel the store had, very much like the kitchen at my grandma's house. The service was great and very friendly, really made you feel like home. I would go back for the pie."}
{"text":"I haven't had anything but pies here so I will focus on that. The pies aren't the best, and they are certainly expensive but I like it none the less because of how fresh the fruits in the pies have always been.   I recommend it if you're in the area"}
{"text":"I love saskatoons (and choke cherries)!  If you're Blackfoot, ya know what I'm talking about.  So when a friend in Calgary mentioned saskatoon pie, we were gone.  Saskatoons are a berry which grows in southern Alberta.  They have been eaten for time immemorial by our people.  For the winter months, these berries were mixed with buffalo meat to make pemmican (I still want to try some).    But let's get back to pies.  I was psyched to have a saskatoon pie.  Pies Plus is in a strip mall in south Calgary.  The interior has that \"country\" feel to it with all kinds of country decor.  The person taking our order was a bit blah, no smile, no welcoming gestures; she was a robot (musta had a corn cob up her butt).  The pie was good.  I don't think it could top a huckleberry or blackberry pie, but it was definitely good, and it didn't stop me from finishing it.  Saskatoon pies are a rarity (you just can't get saskatoons at your local grocer).  So if you get the chance, you should always take the opportunity."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the first time I ever went was a last second scramble to pick something up for a party I was going to. I was asked to bring dessert so I decided to hit up Pies Plus since I had heard good things about it.  Now, I was surprised at the price of their Pies - it was a little expensive but taste wise, they were delicious :)  If the prices were a bit better, I'd give them 5 stars but if you want to be the favourite guest at a party, roll up with a pie from Pies Plus :)"}
{"text":"$44 for 2 pies. By far the most we've ever paid. Certainly not the best. Out of the \"80 varieties\" there was only 5 to choose from. Definitely not recommended."}
