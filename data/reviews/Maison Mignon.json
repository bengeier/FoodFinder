{"text":"Friendly place and the beef noodle soup is fantastic. The custard cake is exactly like the way we get in Taiwan. I will sure go back and introduce it to my friends for some nice Taiwanese food."}
{"text":"This is such a great restaurant. A family run resto with  a variety of Asian dishes. The food is delicious and the prices are extremely reasonable. One of my favourite places in the city."}
{"text":"Authentic homecooked food. Owner is very welcoming and warm. Big portions for the price. You have to try their taiwanese beef noodle soup, the broth is so tasty and the meat is very tender. Their japanese porc dish is also very good and the size is very generous."}
{"text":"This is such a cozy asian restaurant, the owner is very nice and friendly, all the foods are affordable and delicious too!"}
{"text":"Beef soup is good but the portion is really small. I believed that photo there have enlarged the portion a lot. It is Taiwanese food but nothing spectacular compare to local Asian restaurants. Taiwanese style fried chicken is close to AUTHENTIC. I do suggest to try for a simple lunch but not for a meal. 
Taro pancake is actually not bad but expensive at 2.50$/piece."}
{"text":"The chicken is awful!! It doesn't even feel like it's chicken... It was soo awful that at first we didn't even think that it was chicken. The vegetables were still frozen. But the soup was great! The bowl of soup was huge. The best part about the place were the spring rolls."}
{"text":"This is a great family restaurant! Their food is great and natural. They even bake fresh treats! I love their food."}
{"text":"Just finished having the most delicious bowl of Taiwanese beef noodle soup. It tastes like nothing I've had before. I came here based on the Yelp recommendations as I was feeling like having some noodles while in Montreal and I was not disappointed. 

The  restaurant is in a quiet area and is small and cozy. The owner/operator is very nice. The inside of the restaurant has a very homey feeling like you've been invited to eat at someone's house. We ordered beef noodle soup and Cantonese chow mein. The definite standout was the beef noodle soup. It was so delicious. I've had similar noodles in Toronto but the broth was the best I've had. I don't know what their secret recipe is but oh yum yum. We also had the custard filled and red bean filled cakes which were freshly made. They were delicious as well. 

If you're in the area it is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I ordered fried Singapore style noodles, it wasn't fried or anything, the dish entirely felt like it was heated in the microwave feeling soggy and lacking flavour, specially oil. It was dry but I continued to eat because I was hungry and also because I ordered it extra spicy which fortunately masked the unprofessionally prepared dish. The chef? It's a 14 year old boy who prepared my dish for Pete's sakes! The ambiance and decor? What ambiance and decor? Bring along some nicely prepared plate and decorated restaurant pictures to inspire you while eating in this very bland place. 
 Anyway, I just couldn't wait to fill my stomach and get outa there. Oh, and the owner charged me tax which is a must of course but while paying, he simply opened the register and put my cash in there with NO receipt or anything....Hmmm ok, no comments"}
{"text":"La soupe taiwanaise avec porc est médiocre, il y a presque rien comme contenu...
 C'est pas mieux qu'une soupe hot and sour. Vraiment déçue!"}
{"text":"Little hidden Gem in Saint-Laurent.

Had the Omuraisu and the Fried Fish (split with a friend) and both were absolutely great!
Both were only $10.

The quality was clearly there.
This is a small family run place and one of the owner who served us was extremely friendly.

A friend lives nearby and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Price is fair, food is DELICIOUS! Where to start? The lady owner cooks her broth for 5 hours to get it ready - that's dedication! While my colleagues got the beef noodle soup and were almost dying over it (from pleasure guys!), I got the vegetarian/vegan option: sweet and sour soup and  a dish of udon noodles with veggies. Everything was so tasty ...and the udon noodles - woah, delicious, flavourful, the whole thing tastes real aromas - not fake ones like it could be often the case sometimes! Even veggies felt fresh and crunchy. I had indeed a lot of pleasure eating at this little restaurant. They also have nice little cookies with lightly sweeten pineapple in the inside (with pineapple that doesn't taste canny!). I would go again for their authentic food, great service (the owner is quite talkative and funny) - and the fair price. By the way, they do 4 broths during the holidays: mango, nuts, beef and cranberry (can't remember for sure about this one!). Anyway, bon appétit if you go!"}
{"text":"Went there a couple of months back with my girlfriend that is Taiwanese.  First thing to talk about is the service.  The service is really great and the owners are really friendly. It's a husband and wife operation with both of them having studies cuisines. He studied pastries and he has a catalogue of things he has done that looked simply incredible. 

The location is not that great. It's an old place and it shows its age.

For the food. I had the beef soup and my girlfriend did also. It was a good soup but not as authentic as you would have expected.

We also took some moon cakes. These were made right in front of us. They were good but not sure they are worth the price. I imagine that the price is because they are made fresh and that there's not that many places in Montreal where you can get fresh ones but still the price was a bit steep."}
{"text":"I go there once in a while to get their home made pineapple cakes. So genuinely Taiwanese and definitely the best you can find in Montreal. Other small eats such as onigiri (Japanese triangle rice roll) and zongzi (Chinese sticky rice wrapped in bamboo leaves) are also great. 

Haven't had a chance to have meals there. Will try next time."}
{"text":"What a big disappointment!

I was prepared to get a good beef noodles soup. And I got, an average beef noodles soup.

The chunk of beef were tough and very large, so you could not get a little bit of meat In every mouthful. The broth was ok, no more, no less. The noodles were good. They felt freshly made and authentic.

The food was a 3-3.5 stars. It was the experience inside the restaurant that was horrible.

Firstly, a customer that was ordering to go began talking very rudely to us. Saying that we were not using our chopsticks correctly and then proceed on ranting about what was on TV.

We could not ignore him. The restaurant is so small and without music. Making every discussion impossible to miss.

In a way, the owner had nothing to do with the rude customer. But as soon as the rude man left with is order. The owner started talking with us. 

The moment we had our meal, we haven't been able to talk together.

He was nice, but he was pointing at different things in the restaurant telling us how much it costed. Like the oven to make the custard pie is 3 000$ and the permit to operate it is 450$ a year.

And then he started talking about the linguistic debate. I was sweating like a sinner in a church. I mean. Please can we pay and leave please?!

The food was ok. But I just had such a bad experience I can't leave a higher note then this.

I'm not hard to please. Go and see my other reviews you will see that I give 4 stars review like if they were candy on Halloween. I give 4 stars to McDonald!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past month.  The place is run by a husband/wife and has been opened for about two years.  I appreciate how they take the time to explain where the food comes from and how they use their home made recipes.  The beef noodle soup is excellent.  I am told they boil the broth for hours and use apples/fruits to add flavour rather than msg.  If you go on the weekend, they serve this delicious custard pancake.  Use the paper bag when eating the pancakes as it can get quite messy."}
{"text":"This restaurant really cares about their customers! Great service, great food, super nice people and they don't use MSG in case you're wondering."}
{"text":"That beef noodle soup is incredible, would be perfection if they made their own noodles though. The owner is very friendly and hospitable. The only other thing I've had was the general tao which is too breaded. But I only go there for the soup."}
{"text":"My parents live in the area so we decided to drop by for lunch on a cold Sunday. The restaurant is tiny. We were the only ones there at first but the place filled up quickly after our arrival. The owner was extremely outgoing and friendly, going out of his way to explain the menu and Taiwanese culture to us in lots of detail. He enthusiastically told us he was trained by a local celebrity chef in Taiwan and showed us the recipes she had published in a magazine. Our conversation really piqued our curiosity and by then we were impatient to sample his cuisine. 

It definitely did not disappoint. The menu is half Taiwanese and half Japanese. We tried the Taiwanese beef noodle soup, which consisted of perfectly al dente udon-like noodles chilling in a deep, rich beef broth; the heavenly Taiwanese minced pork rice, which tasted like it had been simmering in its juices for hours; crispy Japanese almond shrimps; sweet and sour deep fried fish, and some kind of chicken katsu, although the sauce tasted a bit more like teriyaki than the traditional plum sauce. Everything was fresh and flavorful, and the fried food was surprisingly not oily at all. I personally preferred the Taiwanese dishes because it tasted like the kind of home-cooked meals you yearn for once you've left the family nest, but I must admit the fried dishes were very well executed and would delight any tempura fan.

We finished the meal with a sample of the pancakes that are only offered on weekends: taro, sweet potato, custard and red bean. It was the perfect end to a very enjoyable lunch. I really admired how passionate the owners seemed, and thought it really showed in their cooking. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"An amazing hidden gem mom and pop kitchen. I had the beef soup and it was as good as the reviews claim.  The beef was tender and juicy and the broth tasty without MSG. Can't wait to come back and try everything on the menu. 
Service was as amazing as the food. It was someone's birthday and the waiter/owner blasted the bday song and took pics."}
{"text":"Simple, no frills place. I had the General Tao Chicken and maybe I'm not just accustomed to the dish but I found it too sweet. The portion size was good and customer service was friendly"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to visiting maison mignon based on the yelp raves. Unfortunately, my experience wasn't quite up to par for what I expected. But first, I have never had beef so tender in my life. Melt in your mouth. Delectable.

 However, this is unfortunately where the praise ends. The broth of the soup was about lukewarm, and lacked seasoning. The thing that helped was the bowl of kimchee they give, but it still doesn't help that much. I personally did not really like the texture and heaviness of the noodles, but I feel like it's a personal taste thing. 

We got two of each variety of the cakes they make on Wednesday. Unfortunately, I didn't like them very much and wouldn't recommend unless you strongly love black beans (it wasn't a paste) or taro. 

Overall, I was disappointed, and as a student, it was kind of upsetting to dish out 40 bucks (2people) for a soup you didn't finish, and some cakes I didn't end up liking (more my own fault). 
Won't be going back- too many tasty pho options in vsl."}
{"text":"Very good Taiwan food, the beef noodle is the the best. They also have snacks which made by the chef, delicious and not expensive."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem. Yelp's suggestion and the reviews of folks who been there already created my state of curiosity to man up and to give it a try.

The owners are very caring and friendly. You can feel that they are proud of their cuisine and culture since their dishes are cooked with fresh and natural ingredients. 

I ordered the beef noodle soup which the owner recommended it since it was still freshly made. Oh my, that soup is amazing! That beef broth is so pure and so delicious! It's not over salty, just perfect to my taste :) You get back a very generous portion of that tender and juicy beef, a beef broth that will amaze you and some good fresh vegetables.. Oh and I forgot the marinated veggies on the side that you can put over the top of your soup.. After all this, what could go wrong? Niente, rien, nothing 

The pineapple cake are also a must! their made by them and it's for only 1.50$ each. Overall the soup costs 10$ which according to me it was more than worth it.

I will definitely go back there soon in order to try their weekend fresh made pancakes which I also have to give it a try.

Be happy.. Eat well :)"}
{"text":"We came here recommended by a friend to try out their authentic Taiwanese beef soup and boy did that recommendation deliver!! I'm licking my licks just thinking of this place. If I ever find myself in this area anytime between October to April, I will be here to warm up my bones with that awesome soup! The serving size is generous and the price-tag is very reasonable.

The staff is a couple and are very welcoming and eager to please. The gentleman left a very positive impression on me. The place is small yet has that nice homely feel to it, they're a relatively new business and I hope word gets out, this place should be filled with patrons.

I had a few other things but they truly paled to comparison to this great soup! If I ever find myself in the area, I have to go back in!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this Taiwanese style restaurant in Montreal, and it surprises me! We ordered beef noodle and the pork minced rice, all made from the raw beef and no MSG was added. Will definitely come back here again if we are catching a flight from Montreal (:

Very close and great choice if you are looking for a restaurant near the Montreal Trudeau Airport!

I have to mention how lovely the owners are. They greeted and welcomed us to the restaurant, made the whole restaurant a happy atmosphere to dine with."}
{"text":"I been here last Friday  the food really nice ,I think that's best Taiwanese  restaurant in montreal beef noodle and rice really nice I love it, also boss nice guy however I give five star"}
{"text":"I grew up in Taiwan and I want to let everyone know this store makes AUTHENTIC Taiwanese dish! 
Taiwanese  food are not meant to be salty. They should be no mag and lightly salted.

I came to Montreal for business trip and crave for Taiwanese food since there are no legit Taiwanese food in New York. I ordered minced pork rice and the meat soup. It was freaking delicious. The way they Cook its home style flavor. I almost cried because I haven't taste such a good Taiwanese food in a long time. 



If I have money I will fly to Montreal and eat here again to feel Taiwanese mom-style home cooking!"}
{"text":"We shared all three of their signature (traditional Taiwanese) dishes. For the quality and portion we were expecting about a 40$ bill, but ended up only paying 30$ after tips. 

Atmosphere: 
The service is excellent, the restaurant clean and well-lit. Clean washroom, which is always a good indicator of how clean their kitchen might be.

Food:
The quality of food is really astonishing. 

For the traiditional Taiwanese braised beef soup, I have never tasted a soup stock that is as evident as in here that it's made from actual meat and/or bones, as oppose to synthetic beef flavoring that the great majority of other restaurant use. The meat itself juicy and tender, the noodles are of quite high quality

They use higher quality of diced pork as oppose to the more traditional ground pork that you generally find in braised pork rice, and that jump in quality is quite obvious when I tasted it.

Convenience:
It's located about 3 minutes walk from Cote-Vertu Metro"}
{"text":"Went here last night with a small group of Yelp friends, people generally smarter than me about authentic Taiwanese food. All I knew was it had been chilly and felt like fall and I was craving soup, and man did this tiny hole in the wall deliver. 

We were the only ones in there on a Tuesday night, and the young couple who own the place and make all the food from scratch seemed perplexed but happy we were there, and eventually we got them to come out and chat with us and they were so funny and dear and great. We all ordered the beef noodle soup that Bozan X had told us about, except for the representative from the land of Vegetarian who was well taken care of as well, but will no doubt tell her own story. The soup was just outstanding. Broth that takes 5 hours to simmer to glorious savoury perfection, beef that's falling apart tender, crunchy veg and incredible homemade noodles that I could eat daily. 

I might go back this weekend for the mooncakes, and around Christmas for all the different cakes the mama chef so proudly told us tales of, and I'll be back before then many times for sure to sooth away the winter chill with these lovin spoonfuls."}
{"text":"I visited Maison Mignon in June 2017 during a business trip. The owner is very friendly and the food is authentic Taiwanese street food style.It's comfort food to me. Don't forget to have the Taiwanese style stuffed pancake (???) and some moon cake for dessert!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem of a restaurant that you would definitely pass by if not for a local Yelper (Bozan) who has inside knowledge of how amazing the specialty beef noodle soup is here. Really it sure is outstanding for Taiwanese beef noodle soup. The broth is wonderfully rich in flavour. So rich yet not salty and a great mix of tender fall off the bone meat plus Shanghai bok chop with a chewy noodle. If you are into pho you must try this soup as its different yet flavour is out of this world!  A bowl of soup on a cold fall-winter day is an amazing way to warm up the body. They also offer a hot chilli sauce to zip it up another notch if spicy is to your liking. 

The restaurant is simple yet decor is clean and comfortable. The husband and wife team do also special Taiwanese cookies which we got to sample the pineapple filled ones which were a pleasant finish to a big bowl of soup. 

Service was friendly and we were the only ones in the restaurant on the visit so we had more personal explanations of their culture with some jokes thrown in.

Price wise it's extremely inexpensive at around $10 a bowl. The crew that came left with full tummies and content satisfaction. The menu is small but you can sense they care to serve you their home cooking plus dedication to delivering a top notch meal! I haven't found many places in MTL that specilaze in Taiwanese food. There is not a huge offering on the menu as they have mainly Chinese dishes plus some Sushi but the soup is out of this world!  I'm definitely coming back to sample more dishes of the menu specifically speaking their stir fry's."}
{"text":"Restaurant familiale ou la qualité et fraîcheur sont au rendez-vous. Accueil chaleureux, plats savoureux et très chauds et même l'eau de table servie est de l'eau filtrée. 
Le restaurant aurait eu 5* si mon entrée n'avait pas été servie presque au même moment que mon plat."}
{"text":"It is a very cosy place. decent food with good price. one of the very rare Taiwanese style restaurent in Montreal. highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a mom and pop restaurant, I felt at home as soon as I entered .  The owner was extremely friendly and helpful in making recommendations. We ordered 5 items on the menu because we wanted to try as many as possible.  All dishes were delicious and were of generous portions. Taiwainese beef noodle soup - The broth is intended to be of neutral tasting. It's a simple beef broth. I appreciated that the soup  wasn't salty or had any MSG like in most Asians cuisines do.  I adjusted  the broth flavour by adding a few drops of soy/vinegar and their homemade hot sauce . Let me tell you, this was the most comforting soup I've had in a while. We will definitely come back. This little gem will be our spot when we crave homemade food. Our bill was just under $42. Great value and good food."}
{"text":"Quick and courteous service. This is a small family-run business and the owner serves you. Very sweet and nice ambiance. Small selection of Taiwanese and Japanese dishes. Tasty and average in terms of pricing. Clean and quiet dining area. Worth taking a look at."}
{"text":"Went as a Chinese family of 5 including a toddler and two grandparents, had two orders of beef noodles, 1 minced pork and rice, 1 deep fried filet Japanese style and Japanese style pork chop. Finished up with fresh tarot, red bean and custard pancakes and pineapple cakes. Loved it. We would go back for the beef noodles and minced pork and all the desserts. We enjoy homey food that doesn't drown in msg. The Japanese items were good too, the batter that they use is super crispy and just right but we'd prefer the Taiwanese items. The desserts are delicious. The fillings aren't too sweet, same with the pineapple cakes. They only make this Fri to sun. We even brought extra to take home. All in all, will absolutely be going back. One down side, in the winter, dress warmly... They only have one heater..."}
{"text":"Was on Decarie street near Cote Vertu, hungry, whipped out my phone, Yelp app, made decision, Maison Mignon. After scrolling through the menu I knew that I had to get the infamous beef soup. The rich and steamy beefy broth accompanied by thick noodles was the perfect remedy to the mild cold that I was fighting. 

If you ever ask the staffs what the street food-like stand with little cast iron sockets is for then they'll tell you it's for the pancakes that come in three different fillings: custard, taro and red bean. The first one has a beautiful hint of vanilla with the right amount of sweet, the second has a subtle floral note and the last one, well... It's red beanish. 

Maison Mignon was a pleasant discovery and I'd definitely come back to see what the menu is hiding from me."}
{"text":"We discovered this restaurant through Yelp a few weeks ago and since my husband's family is Taiwanese, we decided to give it a try. According to them, this restaurant has authentic Taiwanese fare.I thought their beef noodle soup and tonkatsu (Japanese porc) were both fantastic. I loved that the owner suggested we share different items on the menu. 

The best part was that he mentioned they could cook family-styled Taiwanese meals that were off the menu if we were a group of 7 or more and if we gave them a 48 hr notice. We made a reservation two days ago and today, we were surprised with a series of authentic home-cooked dishes with extremely fresh ingredients. The dishes weren't too salty and the ingredients were maybe 70% vegetarian, so it was very healthy overall.  In addition, the owner wrote down the dishes we had today such that if we were to return in a month, he would make sure we would try a whole set of different dishes. How amazing is that? 

At the end, we ordered the specially made UFO cakes. You should definitely try the custard ones, they are best when freshly baked! The taro and red bean ones are good too. If they happen to have a freshly baked batch of pineapple cake, make sure to get one or two of those as well. 

The restaurant is a bit out of the way and lacks  in ambiance, but this mom and pop shop is a nice little discovery where you are sure to try out really authentic Taiwanese fare for a reasonable price. It might not be the place for a fancy date, but for a bunch of foodie friends who just want to try something new, or a Chinese family who just wants healthy home cooked food, I think this place is worth trying out."}
{"text":"Ever since I got back from Taiwan, I havent gotten a single taiwanese beef noodle soup that tastes genuine, up until today. It's not featured on the menu but locals love it. 

The reason why this soup is legit is because the broth is made out of beef bones so it's packed with flavour, and behind it is a taiwanese chef who trained in japanese cuisine. 

Their tea is particularly tasty with the addition of roasted nuts and rice. 

The pancakes come filled with red beans or taro, but taro was the best. 

I have yet to try their Japanese menu."}
