{"text":"Ordered delivery from the restaurant to our workplace. Food was absolutely amazing. Ordered a little bit of everything. From bagels, to heros, sandwiches and wraps, this place has it all. Definitely will order from this place again. Delivery was dirt cheap and service was quick. They use premium Boar's Head meats so their sandwiches are great. Authentic east coast food at a low price as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches and fresh tossed salads ! Any place in town that serves east coast type sandwiches, I am in! The bread is the best & they only use Boars Head meats .. Delish!
Go try this place ! Way better than the chain sandwich shops & prices are super cheap. You will be very pleased with the great food& friendly staff !"}
{"text":"First time trying out this place. We found them in Groupon. At first the place looks scary coz of the area. BUT omg can i just say one of the best customer service ever they close at 3pm we got there at 2:58 and they still took our order the guy that made our sandwich was so nice about it and they way he made our sandwich not rushed or didnt even saw a hint that he was irritated since its time for him to go home. We even met the owner and their sandwich is the BOMB! I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service. Very fresh ingredients and a plus to be connected to the store. Enjoyed browsing while food being prepared."}
{"text":"Excellent. Had 5.99 lunch special. Turkey and Swiss on rye (toasted) with everything. Onion and garlic chips were awesome. Best small detail is the oil on the sandwich was good tasting olive oil. Will be back"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service was even better! Quality ingredients used to make their delicious subs! I highly recommend it to anyone who is visiting Vegas or anyone who is from the area! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Delivery to my hotel room, Ordered salad and asked for a large iced tea and instead they brought a hot coffee. The salad was just okay. :( was hoping for better service and quality."}
{"text":"The girl who took our orders and prepared the sandwiches offered excellent customer service and cared about her customers and the food.  We were pleasantly surprised at the service and food as we didn't know what to expect as it was inside a general store."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches. Good bread. Lots of quality Boar's Head meat. I had the Baccarat (hot pastrami, grilled onion, melted Swiss, deli mustard) and my husband had the 3-Card Monte (Genoa salami, pepperoni, ham, provolone). Jay was so friendly, upbeat and helpful. It is within walking distance of Freemont, but it was so hot we drove. Plenty of parking. They had a steady stream of customers, many of them obviously regulars."}
{"text":"I'm originally from the east coast but moved to California 4 years ago... These bagels are the best I've had since I left home. My boyfriend doesn't even like bread, don't get me started on that. He ate all of the bagel even when he was too stuffed to eat the whole sandwich. 

Really good option for an inexpensive meal! Our one sandwich, the runner runner,  fed both of us."}
{"text":"I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich from here and it was pretty delicious. It came with tomato slices and a generous amount of cheese. I added avocado slices to mine. It came out perfectly crisp and the cheese was gooey and hot. I'll for sure be back for another."}
{"text":"For what it is... it was pretty good! Found this place by accident while surfing Groupon. The location is a small cafe with about 30 seats inside of a gambling gift shop near Downtown and Freemont Street. It is kind of off the beaten path and if you didn't know it was there, it would be easy to miss. 

Three of us stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday. When we arrived, we were the only ones in the cafe and were greeted promptly. The staff were extremely friendly and told us to take our time. He (Efrain?) was also very courteous when I presented the Groupon... some places give you attitude. 

The food, while not huge... was large enough per serving,  fresh and quite tasty. 

Three things that made me happy...
1) They have Wise potato chips
2) They have salt bagels
3) The cleanliness

The cafe portion was very clean and the employees washed their hands three times while helping us... I'm a germaphobe, so I notice these things! Thank you!

If you are in the area, The Gambler's Cafe is a good, quick stop for a light, simple breakfast or sandwich. Will go back again next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Many options to choose from. From breakfast, salads, or sandwiches. Everything is fresh and great tasting.  I recommended the bacon pancake with hasbrowns. Although it's hard to make up my mind on my absolute favorite.  Open till 3pm and I hear they will be opening for First Fridays! I already know I will be there for a sandwich and beer before next First Friday because the walking distance is awesome."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Food was better than average. Service was the best! Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem just a ten minute walk from the end of the downtown strip. 

The service is really polite and courteous. 

The food is just amazing! We ordered the breakfast wraps and they were huge, well seasoned, and delicious! 

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast and lunch joint, reminisce about back east favorites including the best fresh baked bread and boars head meats and cheeses! Prices are fair, portions are big! A must try!"}
{"text":"Nice sandwich shop. Really good Selection. I've driven by so many times and never really noticed it but if you work nearby, I highly recommend his place. Great deal for lunch on sandwiches."}
{"text":"Back east friends listen up. This is the real deal. Best pickles I've had since the Jewish deli I worked near in Mass. Super garlicky! Also for downtown offices delivery like the strip sandwich shop now long gone. Fast and orders are correct! Keep up the good work! I can't wait to try breakfast. Downtown has needed a fresh and fast lunch option. ;D"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I've had in  a while! I got the bluff it came with fresh vegetables hummus and some really good bread. There were a lot of healthy options as well as delicious comfort food and the staff was really nice and accommodating. Will definitely recommend this cafe to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are wonderful, we bought a Groupon and it was a great deal. Yes service is a little slow, but I'd rather wait a few minutes for the food to be good! I'd come back."}
{"text":"Wowza - this place has fantastic food.
Wozwa - this place has fantastic service.

I ordered delivery through Yelp (eat24)  - the ordering process was quick and easy.
our office placed about a $75 order, trying to please everyone with all their \"special\" requests can be challenging at times. However, Gamblers Cafe got it right.  
They did put my Wrap on a hero roll but in their defense, i think that issue had more to do with the way the Menu was set up on line.  Nonetheless, they delivered my Wrap with 2 extra bags of chips.

Again, our office is very pleased with the food and service.  Everything tasted great and was very fresh.  Cant wait to try more things...mmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"First time writing a review and well worth it! I'm originally from the East coast so this place really brought me back to home. A must go! I'll be going back for sure"}
{"text":"STAY THE HELL AWAY!!! Groupon made it seem appetizing and Yelp had 4 stars so hey can't go wrong! Well I was so so so wrong! Got in around 9am 1 person in front of us, 1 guy working on a fing Saturday morning and he asked me to wait a bit to order! Red flag but dumb me chose to ignore since I already had the damn Groupon! Well 15 minutes later I finally put in order and 45 minutes later we got our food! Nothing special about food! We didn't leave till 1030am! YEAH THATS RIGHT it was a 1hr and 30 minutes I wasted! On the bright side we didn't get sick!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking to not spend $20/person on breakfast or lunch on the strip and can take a 15 minute drive then I highly suggest this place. Very small dining area inside a souvenier shop. But the bagels are new york style just like home.  I suggest the cold bagel sandwich with cream cheese fresh spinach and tomato. For $3! Plus you can shop for your souveniers without paying strip prices for those too!
And the pancakes are more like a pan CAKE."}
{"text":"After reading reviews and purchasing a Groupon, I went to the Gambler's Cafe. It was small,  clean and unassuming. We were greeted when we entered and seated in a booth where I had full view of the service counter and could see our food being prepared.  It took about 10 or so minutes to get our food and the food was DELICIOUS!!! I had the 3-card Monte, their version of an italian sandwich,  and my cousin had the rail bird,  their chicken  sandwich.  We couldn't express enough how much we enjoyed the food.  She had a medium  and I got a large.  We only ate half of the sandwich because they are pretty big. I wish I could tell everyone of this gem of a restaurant/cafe in our wonderful city. If you happen to go downtown for anything,  please go visit them and we experience it for yourself. There service was pretty good, too."}
{"text":"Came here right after purchasing a Groupon. Wanted to take a walk away from Fremont and enjoy the sun. Totally a random store and location with really fresh great tasting food. Had an amazing sandwich and salad to split with the hubby. Nice lady working there-Julie- great personality and good service. Bread delicious, veggies fresh, would go back for a healthy lunch. Don't be put off by the location/ outside.
Clean work area and fresh food."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Ordered a Poker Face (Reuben) and a Loaded Dice (Turkey Club). Wow! Meat to bread ratio was perfect, boars head meat just melts in your mouth! Hidden little gem in the gamblers store!"}
{"text":"I love this place but I went here today (06/02/17) and it's closed. Definitely sad to see it go."}
{"text":"What a find! Came here on our last day in town to get gifts. The cafe made me a great egg white omelette, with the ingredients I wanted. They accommodated my daughter's very particular requests. An easy-going place with good food and personal service!"}
{"text":"I only went thanks to the Yelp deal.  I got the rueben and it was SUPER good.  However, for 2 sandwiches and drinks it was going to cost around $30, which, IMO, is WAY too expensive for a sandwich....no matter how good it is.  The service was slow considering there was only 1 other person in there and there were 3 employees working.  I'd probably only go back if I had a groupon/yelp deal."}
{"text":"Great surprise find! Clean & bright with a great, friendly staff . We loved the unique menu of wonderful combinations. We had 2 wraps, a hero and a BLT sandwich. Everything was so good, I can't say who enjoyed their food more.(2 of us were going to only eat a half...SO GOOD!!....that never happened) And the best part.... the prices are fantastic too!"}
{"text":"Tried the bagels, donuts and coffee on 3 different occasions and was upset with the outcome all 3 times.    2 people to toast and butter a bagel .... still not toasted with hardly any butter ... when my takeout order was ready to eat I tossed it!    NO MORE!"}
{"text":"So while in the office today, two gentleman stopped by passing out free samples of their bagels. Since we are working downtown, sometimes these folks that show up at the door can be a little....sketchy. But this time, we were pleasantly surprised. They gave us a handful of samples of fresh bagels they had made and started talking to us about their business. Gamblers Cafe. All fresh ingredients. The meats used are Boar's Head Brand. They deliver for a tiny fee of $1.50. They have fresh baked goods delivered every morning, etc. All of this was very intriguing. Plus, I think we were all getting bored of the usual Jimmy Johns order. So, we called them up for lunch. (Seems like the old fashioned door to door sales still works, especially when you get to sample the goods) 

We all ordered sandwiches. And all of us agreed they were delicious. We also ordered a cookie and a doughnut. Cause, why not? I ordered the Loaded Dice which was a ham and turkey with bacon. (All In, which is their version of the works) It was huge and it was delicious. The ONLY complaint that I have is in regards to the bread. It was a little overwhelming and it was hard to bite through. Your sandwich is practically served on a loaf of french bread which is amazing because you get real bang for your buck but, it was maybe a little too big. Other than that, excellent. It was loaded with seasonings as well and definitely not lacking in flavor. It tasted like it came from a true NY Deli. Or at least what I imagine would be a true NY Deli...because I have not really been to one. 

We will all be happily ordering from here again and I suggest the same to everyone else as well. Thanks for coming by today guys!

$10.99 for my Giant sub sandwich (Hero)"}
{"text":"The food was good and the prices were beyond fair. If you take advantage of the Yelp and Facebook offers you are in for a very inexpensive meal. The place was clean and the staff very friendly. I would totally come back. I like this place. If your a local they deliver if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Wow what a bomb ass sandwich!  A few weeks ago I was testing the water at our Float Sanctuary Las Vegas and my partner brings this guy to the back with free bagel samples.  He goes on to explain to me how there's no microwaves on site and he uses nothing but the freshest ingredients yada yada and hands me a flier and I read his name on it and I'm like oh shit are you the same Avery Cardoza like the iconic gambling book publisher? He said yes sir.  Funny cause one of his writers is one of my peeps going like 10years back so that was a trip. I knew then that it would be real Brooklyn grub so I kept wanting to go. Even though its just down the road I'm busy as fuck so its hard to sneak away and grab ish.

Fast forward to today.  My partner and I are like are no matter what getting some sammy's down at Gamblers Cafe. We called in an order for pick up.  The girl on the phone was very friendly and accommodating. My partner went to pick up the sandwiches.  I was sitting at the  float center dying of hunger and anticipation to see if the sandwich lived up to Avery's hype.  When she got back we immediately began to tear open our sandwich paper.  The first thing she noticed was that they put two stickers on there in case you only want to eat half your sandwich and wrap the other for later.  How efffing thoughtfull!!  We both got the Loaded Dice. which consisted of the dopest flavor of turkey and ham sliced thin but piled HIGH with bacon and fixings. My partner is a bacon FREAK and she gave the bacon an enthusiastic two thumbs up. We both got all the fixins and the colorful staff did a great job of balancing the amount of fixings for the sandwich. She didnt want the ham so she asked for extra turkey.  Of course we compared our amounts of meat just see if they didnt skimp on the substitution.  Gamblers Cafe passed that test! Both sandwiches were piled equally high. The best of the sandwich was of course the Italian style bread!!!  Crusty on the outside and soft on the inside....LEGIT!!  I told myself I was only going to eat half but hell no i macked down the entire thing it was so delicious!! The Brooklyn style pickle on the side was like icing on the cake.  We will fosho be back to Gambler's Cafe and cant wait to try their breakfast and other REAL FOOD!"}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon to try this place out as we are regularly in Las Vegas to visit family. We walked in and no one else was there other than the 4 employees. After we ordered, a group of 3 came in and ordered. Not only did they get their food first, they were just about finished. It took 25 minutes from order to being served. 

The hot sub was served wrapped up with a   small amount of potato salad on the wrapper so I needed to rip it open so the ps wasn't all over the table.

They advertise Boars Head meat but their pastrami tasted more like corned beef. Sorry, won't be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"DO NOT GET THE GROUPON!! They won't & do NOT accept. Even though the menu/website CLEARLY states \"ALL DAY BREAKFAST!\"

We were there before 2PM & they close at 3.... But they have \"ALL DAY BREAKFAST!!\" 

Bought the $40 breakfast for $18.....

\"Sorry, we don't accept the groupon\""}
{"text":"This place was by far the best meal we had in Vegas!! Friendly staff!! We will definitely come back here the next time we are out in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and very nice people. Don't let the location fool you. My mom was iffy about eating there because of the location but we all left ranting about how stuffed and satisfied we were. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Pretty shocked at the customer service on a simple question. It's not even possible for me to make this up. Was going to order from here but not anymore.

:calls breakfast place to inquire about daily soup cause THEY SAY TO CALL & ASK:
Lady: Oh ... i don't know and the cooks not in yet so ...
Me: Well I don't want to order a random soup without knowing what it is ...
Lady: hold on let me check
:puts me on soft rock waiting song:
Lady: yeah actually the cook is not coming in today cause it's Saturday so there will be no soup
Me: so ... will you guys still serve food? Since the cook is not there??
Lady: yeah
Me: ok ... well thank you ...
Lady: Excuse me? (In an offended tone for some reason??)
Me: I said thank you 
Lady: oh! Ok thanks bye!!

Yeah. Thank you but no thank you. Your Grubhub told me to call to ask about this item. I didn't do anything wrong lol."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon to this place, tried to use it, but everytime I tried to use it they had closed early. I finally gave up."}
{"text":"Vary slow service. Girl talking on the phone several minutes b4 starting my food, can't imagine more then 2 or 3 people waiting for they're food in this place...wait time would be crazy...now my food is on the grill and she's back on the phone. Vary unprofessional and definitely won't be back...they didn't even have bacon to sell me with breakfast...."}
{"text":"Great sandwich.   Had the turkey and it was very good.   I would describe the restaurant as finding a $5 chip in your $1 chip bucket.  It's a nice surprise, but your not going to go super crazy over it.  However, you will be happy you found it."}
{"text":"Gamblers Cafe is fantastic.  Best subs since I left New York 40 years ago.  Bought this on Groupon figures I would try it out.  What a find.  They use this fantastic bread, boats head meats and freshest of fresh deli meats.  Go there.  I will return again and again.

{"text":"Great food, especially the hash browns. Good value for the price-check it out & you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"This is near the downtown district and hard to get to by bus - you have to walk a good 1-1/.2 mile from the bus stop (yes we did not have a car).   The booth table was wobbly, we moved to the next one.   We were there at 12:00 for lunch and ordered the soup and sandwich combo (was told the soup would be \"a few more minutes - not ready)\",  we werent told our sandwiches were ready (we had to ask) and pickup.   However, our soup was never told it was ready.  We waited patiently as the clock ticked and we waited for OVER 1 hour for a cup of soup and we had to ask for it almost when we were done.   This is really a take-out place even if there are tables and chairs there.    Staff is extremely slow.   It is hard to find, and in a Gamblers Store.    Sandwiches were o.k., but location and service was below par."}
{"text":"Nice place a short walk from Downtown Vegas.  We decided to give it a try due to their no-frills menu, reasonable prices and a special they were running on Yelp.

Doesn't appear to be a cafe as it is housed in the Gambler's Supply store.  The cafe umbrellas out front gave us the only impression of offering food!

We ordered a bagel, a bagel egg breakfast sandwich, bacon, coffee and juices.  As the only patrons, food came out very quick.  Only complaint was that the coffee was extremely strong!!  Diluted with water and it was still too bold.

Give this place a try!!  Friendly, unassuming staff that just want to make folks some good food!"}
{"text":"This place has really good sandwiches.  I love the loaded dice, super hearty that reminds me of the old school sandwiches I used to get as a kid back east, like an east coast deli.  Ambience is a bit different inside a large gambler's store, but the food is great.  The bread and ingredients are top quality."}
{"text":"Braved the construction traffic to get here and it was well worth it. Food was great and staff courteous and super friendly."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick sandwich or a big plate of breakfast. The sandwiches and wraps are great. They use boars head meat and cheese and really good fresh baguettes. The staff is also very cool and friendly especially the cook Jay. He's very loud and funny (probably gay) The gamblers store is really cool too. Very \"Vegas\" place to check out."}
{"text":"Funny hours. First off, online they say they open at 8. That's a lie. On the door, it clearly says 9. Additionally, the sign doesn't say the cafe isn't open on Sundays but guess what, it isn't! I'm not sure what this place is like but judging by the shifty hours, I wouldn't even remotely try it!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to get home and eat the roll the dice sandwich. After seeing the groupon I had to come in at 7am for a sub. Note the tiny cafe is actually at the cross street of main and commerce. The general store is connected but does not open until 9am. The young girl was very helpful and friendly . Will update after first bite"}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Food was great.  Highly recommend this place for breakfast.  I havent tried lunch yet, that is next!"}
{"text":"Would've given this place 4 stars, until they forgot to make my sandwich a combo....and have yet to deliver my chips and drink. Still waiting....
I forgot to mention, when I called back, I got hung up on. Customer Service much?!
*After my recent rage (see above), the owner personally reached out to me and rectified the situation. Not only was he genuinely apologetic, he hand delivered lunch to me! Now, that's what I call service! On top of that, the sandwich was delicious! Thanks, Avery!*"}
