{"text":"LOVE IT. Get the salmon avocado poke bowl. Just do it - you will have no regrets. It's fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Tried the salmon avocado poke bowl with kale noodle and it was awesome. Really fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"The torched salmon poke bowl is amazing. Lovely little cafe in the neighbourhood. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"They added grape tomatoes! If they read my review and changed the bowl, props to them. If they just forgot the grape tomatoes the first time I came, then oh.  Edit: Oh, there's no corn this time. That's probably why there's grape tomatoes."}
{"text":"Another new café located in the north part of Markham!   This café is tucked away right across the Subaru Dealer on Markham Road north of 16. It's right below the new condominiums facing Markham Road.   The owner greeted me directly as I approached the menu. She offered me a sample of their House Black Blended Tea, Japanese Roasted Green Tea, and a Caramel flavored tea. I personally found their strongest tea (House Blend) to be my favourite. The flavors are quite unique and I went with the Roasted Tea which was light and tasteful with the least amount of caffeine.  Tried their Tonkatsu Ramen for $8.99 with a serving of extra noodles for $1. The amount of pork was generous as there were 3 thick slices. As my friends would say I'm a ramen enthusiast, the ramen here was not very notable. The pork wasn't very soft, and the whole bowl itself felt kind of bland. 2/5. To be fair, you should only expect so much for ramen at a café as a opposed to a ramen joint down the street. As such, I don't think it's fair to rate them based on their ramen.  The service was offered by the owner was nothing short of spectacular and you could tell she is passionate in what she's doing and always trying to make the customers have a great experience.   Will definitely return to try their other drinks!  **This rating is based solely on the drinks and service experience."}
{"text":"[ATMOSPHERE] Komeya Cafe is located at the base of a condo building in northeast Markham, so it's a bit hidden. It was so nice and cozy. The music was so relaxing and chill. The staff were so polite and welcoming.  [FOOD] Unfortunately the ramen was not very notable. It wasn't bad but I'd probably stick to ramen joints for a delicious bowl of ramen. The meat portion was generous - three slices of pork, which is more than many other places I've been to. The broth was not too flavourful and the whole dish itself wasn't hot enough. I liked the egg, seaweed and corn though. The poké bowl was great though!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, it has a good concept and I was hoping it would be a lot like Moji in Peachtree Plaza. Sadly, there were quite a few issues. First, my small order of 2 ramen and 2 large roasted green tea cold milk teas took 20 minutes. The server, although very sweet, watched as I packed up my own order into the takeout bag because she seemed helpless to do it herself. She did open the door for me...so very strange.  The food itself wasn't bad but way overpriced for the quantity and quality. The pork pieces in the ramen were fairly good, the broth was decent however, don't expect Kinton quality, at least you get a whole egg. The egg was slightly overdone. The noodles were fresh however they were stuck together so I believe they were made ahead of time and refrigerated. If that was the case then why did it take so long to make order? It was also quite a small order and for the price I was expecting more of everything.  The roasted green tea is very tasty but for $5.99 for the large, I do expect to be able to customize my order eg. make less sweet etc. It only comes one way and that's it.   This place has potential, I do hope they decide to check out Moji and see what more they can do. Either that or lower the prices."}
{"text":"I got the tonkotsu ramen and my friend got a salmon avacado poke bowl. The tonkotsu ramen was pretty good for the price, the egg was great and I really liked the pork, even though it was fatty. Not too salty, like other ramen places in the area.   The salmon avacado was really good and had great portions. They added these tempura bits that gave it a really good texture, probably was the highlight of it.  The service was also pretty nice, they gave us recommendations and were friendly."}
{"text":"Super cute place! The food is amazing for its price. The owner and the staff are really nice and provide fantastic service! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Limited seating, self served water and disposable utensils. Food court quality imo, which is reflected in the price. Not thrilled and not unreasonable."}
{"text":"Ordered a Salmon avocado poke bowl and it's was ammmmazing. Drools* Spicy mayo/eel sauce is a must try."}
{"text":"Delicious place for poke bowl. Especially the torched salmon. A bit pricey but it is extremely filling and satisfying."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm glad this up and coming cafe is getting the proper exposure it deserves, as Poke bowls finally make their glorious entrance to Markham. This place is a cute little casual cafe without sit down service so you don't need to pay tips.   I've had poke bowls at many leading chains in the past, and I can say that Komeya surely did not disappoint. I ordered the Salmon and Avocado poke bowl and they recommended the typical Japanese sauce as a dressing. It was put on the side so that I may add as little or as much as I liked. The toppings were pretty simple, nothing fancy like other places such as pokito or good catch, but I liked the simplicity!   The best part was the art of ratios. Very generous portions of raw fish that matched the amount of rice given. The crispy tempura bits inside made every bite extremely crunchy and delightful.   My friend ordered their Chicken Curry Udon and she said that it's the best that she's had! Yes, Komeya is known for their poke bowls, but I believe that the other menu items are also worth trying.   Would definitely return to try their kale noodles! Just kidding, not a fan of kale but seriously guys! They've got kale noodles! That's pretty cool."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day with a coworker. I had the salmon poke bowl which was very hearty. Portions are great with good prices. They're a tiny shop so don't expect well rounded service. You go up to the counter to order, they give you a number and then bring your order to wherever you're seated. Great for takeouts imo :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful cafe for our uptown resident. I grab a ginger milk tea two weeks ago. I'm very impressed. They were using the fresh ginger drops not the powder one. I went few days ago after my test to see if they still keep using the fresh ginger dropbecause as I know some cafe will using less labour involve ingredient if their business goes. This cafe never upset me. And I tried no caffeine green tea latte which surprise me too in regards of texture /smoothness and sweetness level. Even compared to large green logo, I could say this even worth my money. I asked them if they have something for Kids too? They recommended passion fruit tea. I have my kids to try. They show me . I will try that next time definitely( full of VC, adding freshness to this beach weather) . More for me to discover from this cafe as I know they are adding Ramen and more dessert"}
{"text":"Hidden gem, food is good simple yet good quality. Been going here for awhile now and consistent. Place very cozzy and convinient, less traffic area and ample parking. Food always made fresh hot and tastety. I always order the beef don and chicken don, somehow kids really like them. They always run out of pork cutlet which one day i will get the chance to try. Hope that they build more places like this around the area. Given enough time this place would be crowded and i have to look for another place to enjoy."}
{"text":"Komeya is a small cafe-style restaurant under a set of condos.  Thankfully, the condo area has parking directly in front.  There are few tables and 4-5 stool seats by the window, so it is best for very small parties or single patrons.  It's pretty much a self-served restaurant with utensils on the side for you to grab.  Options are few - only a few items available for rice/poke.    Ordered a salmon avocado poke bowl which was surprising in its portions - unlike a lot of poke places, came with a decent amount of fish.  Otherwise, taste was only average and my avocado was very brown and unappetizing.    You have the option of making your food a combo and adding soup or drinks."}
{"text":"Erm...I had to wait 40mins for a poke bowl...A poke bowl that is made from putting pre-made ingredients in a bowl and there was just one table without food before I put in my order, enough said? And when I asked about my order, I was told that it'd be done in 3 mins and that's when they began to assemble the bowl"}
{"text":"Good quiet little spot. Friendly service with happy servers. This seems to be a small family establishment which I love supporting. Price may seem high but with raw fish I rather pay more to ensure quality. Cheap raw sashimi spells out run like hell. Literally."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place today based on the positive yelp reviews from other people. First of all, this place is located beside the condominium plaza across from the Honda motorcycle shop. It's a fairy small place but cozy. I ordered the salmon with avocado poke bowl with spicy mayo and added $2 for the black milk tea. Love it! Great portion and fresh! Will definitely come back again if am near the area!"}
{"text":"One of the best poke places I've had especially for the price & serving size. My boyfriend and I both had he Salmon pole bowls and loved them! For 12$, you get a lot. Great quality of ingredients (however I could do without the eel sauce- too sweet for my liking). This place has great ambience. Great for families but also probably better for smaller families & groups as it isn't too big. Clean environment & I like that they have self serve lemon water! Overall excellent place and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Cafe | Poke Bowl | Ramen | Rice | Bubble tea | Limited Seating | No table service   * 3.5 star *  Opened for 2 weeks, came at 8pm on a weekday, they didn't have any rice selection.  All rice, ramen and poke bowl is only offered from 11:30am-8:30pm (they close at 9pm).  Very nice servers, high ceiling.  Salmon Avocado Poke Bowl $11. Good portion. Fresh fish. You can choose your sauces. I chose wasabi but I didnt taste it at all.  Spicy Tan Tan Ramen $9 Noodles were sticky, egg was good but was noy spicy at all.  Tonkotsu Ramen $9 Very similar to spicy tan tan. Almost no difference. Same where sticky noodles, good egg.  Ginger Spicy milk tea ($2 small) and Japanese Roasted Green Tea ($4 small) pretty good.   Overall I'd come back if I'm in the area but wouldn't go out of my way to come."}
{"text":"Super yummy milk tea and perfectly portioned meals for a cafe! The manager is so sweet and really did everything she could to earn our business and satisfaction during our first visit. This is a clean place, well ventilated and bright. I feel super lucky to have a place with bubble tea in my neighborhood! We will be back many times. Thank you, Komeya!"}
{"text":"Very good food very clean place, the people work here super friendly.  I ordered roasted green tea spool good.  Highly recommend to give it a try.   We had the tuna poke and ramen. Best poke in Toronto so far, fresh and properly seasoned."}
{"text":"A cute little café that's great for a quick bite. My friend and I came here for a Sunday lunch and we both had a poke bowl. Ingredients were fresh and generous. I had the kale noodles that was surprising good with the salmon. I only wish they had more sauce choices for their poke bowls. They only have spicy mayo and the sesame dressing, both of which are pretty heavy and overpowers the other ingredients. It'd be good if they offer more customization and choices for their poke bowls. The staff there were friendly and helpful. Menu was limited but it seems more like a place for a quick lunch anyways. It's a cute place and I would definitely be back again to try their rice dishes or ramen next time if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Nestled among the booming condos of North East Markham is this quaint little japanese cafe at the bottom of one of Upper Village condos. We were warmly greeted by the owner and perused an assortment of trendy Japanese foods dominating the downtown core. There were poke bowls, ramen, cutlets, bbt, etc. We tried a spicy bbq salmon avocado poke bowl with a passion fruit tea. The poke bowl was fresh and the spicy salmon was flavorful.  While this restaurant isn't paving a food revolution, it brings all the trendy Asian foods up to Markham and it does it very well.  I'm happy to recommend this place and am eager to try out more of their menu!"}
{"text":"A good place to have poke in Markham. Wish there were more poke places like this serving up good food.  Clean restaurant and a good assortment or music selection was playing in the background.  Seating: It can get busy during peak times with limited seating so plan to wait or do take out.  Value: Quite filling, Poke bowls started at $11.99 and up + $3 black milk tea option, hot or cold. For two people it ended upto be $30 with taxes.  Food: It was fresh and tasty, I chose the tuna poke with spicy mayo and the sauce was on the side for you to add to your liking. My cold milk tea was a little bland, but the hot milk tea was more flavourful.  Noticed some items were not there anymore. Menu has changed. No more oyakodon.  Worth going back. Would like to try other items."}
{"text":"Overview:  A great little cafe with fresh and delicious food.   Experience/Service: Small restaurant with limited seating. Clearly family owned. Fast service. Food arrived fairly quick.  Warning: When it gets extremely busy, they only allow take out orders, however, they will notify you before ordering.   Food: Salmon Avocado Poke Bowl - $10.99 (with wasabi soy sauce) - Average priced. Ingredients were fresh. Rice was cooked perfectly - not soggy. I also tried the spicy mayo sauce, which was a little overpowering. I would suggest sticking to the wasabi sauce.    Last thoughts:  I will definitely be coming back to try other items on the menu, hopefully when it is not too busy."}
{"text":"This little cafe definitely has a lot of positives!  I ordered the curry rice bowl with chicken and was not able to finish it because the portion was huge.  Maybe too huge for an average appetite!  Hubby had the pork with soup and said it hit the spot on a chilly day.  While the menu is small, there is something for everyone.  Glad we gave this a try!"}
{"text":"Service/Access It's a very small shop situated across Mount Joy Go Station. There really isn't a lot of parking spaces, and I found them very narrow. Now, this place isn't too busy on weeknights so that should be fine. Worst case scenario, I'm sure you can park at the Go Station and walk over - maybe not in winter lols. It's not entirely a self-serve restaurant, but you order at the front and wait until a waiter brings the food to your table. I really like restaurants that are casual, informal, and all that jazz. If you live close, I really recommend coming here for a chill snack, lunch, or dinner. The staff are friendly too.  Food Let me start with the bad stuff. First of all, they need to upgrade their rice. I was not entirely sure that they used Japanese rice, but whatever it is they used, the rice was too rough. To be exact, they weren't soft, and I found the edges extremely hard. For a curry place, rice makes up 50% of the mixture. The curry sauce is good, you probably think they bought it somewhere else lol. As for the chicken, it was more tender for their Oyakodon dish. I think what surprises me is that their food tastes better than its intended presentation. They use plastic bowls, so things look cheap, but the taste is legit. It's pretty much an \"A\" rating food court shop in my opinion.  You might ask why I thought it would be difficult to rate the shop. I honestly didn't feel they deserved an 8 with the curry dish, but their oyakodon dish proved me wrong. My boyfriend came here a while ago and told me that their rice was way better the last time. Given that it's still relatively new and the store isn't a full blown restaurant, they aren't bad at all. Sometimes small stores need recognition or else all we get are restaurants that belong to big chains and us customers won't be greeted with original stuff!"}
{"text":"Definitely, a unique find, considering its odd location in Markham. The little cafe sized restaurant is small in size, however, it does feature an array of dishes from poke bowls, to ramen, rice plates, as well as a variety of drink options (including bubble tea), making it a convenient location grab a full meal or just a drink. The salmon avocado poke bowl, while heavily drenched in sauce, was quite flavourful and was bountifully topped with salmon, avocado, and other vegetable toppings. The ramen, while the broth lacked substantial flavor, had noodles cooked to the right consistency. The strip of pork was flavourful and accompanied the seaweed, as well as the egg. Overall, a good experience for a casual and quick meal, with a good selection for Japanese style food!"}
{"text":"The ramen has a balance of flavour. Not too salty, or bland. The Fresh Ginger Milk Tea uses real  ginger and it taste legit. Staff are very kind."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try even though I've seen mixed reviews on here. I must've been lucky because everything far exceeded my expectations.   When I first walked in, I was kindly greeted by the lady behind the counter. She was easy to talk to and since I wasn't sure of what to order, I asked for a large Cafe Latte with an extra shot of espresso while I decided (This only came out to $3.75).   After a while, I decided to try the Tuna and Avocado Poke Bowl on a bed of Kale (soba-like) noodles (The noodles weren't all stuck together as you might expect from some other establishments, YAY!).  I have to say, for the price you're paying, the portion size is more than fair. Of course, you can't expect the quality of the fish to be exactly what you'd get at a higher end sushi bar, but you get what you pay for. The fish was not slimy, the avocado was as fresh as you could keep it inside a cooling compartment (no browning) and I found it nice that the bowl already came with cucumbers, a bit of seaweed salad, cherry tomatoes, some crispy tempura batter (which I could have done without) and a small portion of pickled ginger.   The food took a while longer to be prepared as I assumed she was the only one working, but I didn't mind as I was not in a rush.   When I finally got my food, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the take out containers were much better quality than some restaurants. To top it off, while I was ordering, I forgot to mention that I would have liked my dressing on the side (some places love to drench your bowl to try and mask some of the sliminess of their fish when it's not as fresh) but I found a tiny sauce container on the side. All in all, this definitely sealed the deal for a new favourite place to grab poke bowls without having to make a trip all the way downtown.   I hope this place stays open for a while though as business seems to be a little slow during lunch time (came around 11:30 on a weekday)."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.   Menu is nice and simple.  A few ramen dishes and a few rice/udon dishes.     Tried the curry chicken on rice with an iced coffee.    The Sweet curry flavour was good and the chicken was nice and moist.   Curry sauce was a little congealed but that could have been fixed if heated a little longer.     My wife had the ramen which was pretty good.   Lots of noodles and 2 PC's of some decently fat pork belly.   Our little one loved the noodles.   All prices had a $2 option for a drink to accompany your meal, hard to say no.     Prices are fairly decent and portion is bigger than it looks.     Would go again.    I saw pictures on yelp of baked goods which I would have loved to try, but didn't see it on the menu or in the display case.   Only snack available looked like chocolate bars they were selling.  Maybe they stopped the baked goods or only available on certain days.   Come if you hungry the food is good.   Nothing really in the snack/appetizer size though"}
{"text":"This is newly opened coffee shop business about three weeks. The manager gave me her biz card and I was welcomed. The store still needs a little time to introduce more their own house made pastries. At this point , the pastries and baked good are supplied by outsourced bakery.  I ordered a large Americano 16 oz $2.89 inc. Tax. It is reasonable and taste strong. They run like Japanese style . I was greeted by the owner with bow. Very friendly and polite I felt like I walked into a store in Japan .   Manager offers me their four signatures milk tea testing. Four different tea bases ?Japanese Roasted green tea based milk tea, house black tea , fresh ginger , rooibos almond cream. Taste buds sense from light to strong.  It is quite impressive to me.  I love milk tea do their house blend milk tea which is strong enough if u like intensive tea taste.  I prefer ginger it is my favorite choice and the gingerly flavor is staying all senses inside, must try.  I give four stars including coffee quality, price and temp and service such as cleanliness and organization. One star would be gained if they also sooner or later make their own home made pastries in house.   They offer free coffee for next visit please stay tuned for more new add on items.  I will be returning to try another items next time."}
{"text":"This is so good!!! I love eating here, it's close to home and the sauce and service is excellent! They are pretty big portions which I love! This girl gotta eat!!   They also have the kale noodle which they make it fresh everday. It's sooooooooo good and it's filling! They have a lot of salmon. I gotten the Salmon and Tuna bowl, they both are super good. I think I've been back here at least 4 times now over the past month. Yes that's how much I love this place! I should try other food on the menu, but I love the poke bowl too much! And for the extra $2 you can get the roasted milk tea :)"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of poke so finding a location that had it on the menu close to where I work was a welcome surprise. The food was fresh and delicious, I had the salmon poke and I was impressed with the freshness and flavor. The portion size was also adequate. They also offer a promotion within a certain time frame that allows you to purchase a drink at a discounted price which is good. I had the green tea latte and it was also tasty. The staff was also very friendly, and welcoming, a woman behind the counter which I'm assuming was the owner offered great service while I was trying to decide on what tea to order which was refereshing. This will probably be a reoccurring food spot for me, def recommend them !"}
{"text":"Yummmmmm i'm so glad i discovered this place! Honestly, I don't have much to compare with because there are like, no Poke bowl restaurants where I live (Komeya was a bit of a stretch). I had the tuna avocado poke bowl with kale noodles, and i absolutely loved it. I believe when you choose Kale noodles, the sauce is default because they didn't ask what sauce i wanted. The noodles were nice and chewy, so i like the texture it added to the bowl. All the different parts of it - seaweed salad, avocado, salmon, little crispy balls, blended together very nicely for me except the ginger when i did not eat. I guess just for me, it's already very flavourful without the ginger, and ginger is very strong by itself. I got the $2 milk tea that came along with it, but the milk tea was not great. It's a good deal if you're thirsty, so i'm not complaining. I'd definitely come back here when I have a poke bowl craving. Seating is also limited, so don't be surprised if it's full!"}
{"text":"Visited Komeya on a Monday, around 1pm. It's a cozy restauarant with not very much seating. Food - 4/5 We ordered the BBQ pork with runny egg on rice, and salmon avocado with kale noodle poke bowl. The poke bowl was quite flavourful although I wish they didnt put so much of those tempura bits in the bowl. It was a little overwhelming. The noodle was cooked well with a good texture. There was a small portion of seaweed salad, but I was hoping for some dried seaweed pieces in there to add another element of texture. The BBQ pork was also very flavourful; it had this smokey, almost burnt kind of flavour that I'm not sure if it was intended, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Egg was runny as advertised and the amount of sauce was good for my liking, but not enough for my girlfriend - she likes a lot of sauce. Service - 5/5 The staff were very attentive and knowledgable about the food. I think one of the two staff was the owner. She came by and checked up on us twice. We ordered a black milk tea as well and it wasn't very cold and had no ice in it, so we asked if we could get some ice and the lady was happy to do so.  Value - 3/5 The food was good but I feel it was slightly overpriced - at least for lunch. Our total came to around $29."}
{"text":"New fusion restaurant located on Markham road and Hwy 16. Easy access parking and free wifi in the cafe. The staff are very friendly, however, the level of services needed for improvement."}
{"text":"We had the okayadon (sp?) and tonkatsu ramen. Food was easily 2/5. Not worth the price, small portions... The chicken tasted old and the tonkatsu broth was plain (tasted like salt water). The slices of meat in the ramen was also dry.   The only saving grace was the ginger milk tea I had..  Definitely won't be back here despite living upstairs."}
{"text":"The price was high for me AT FIRST but then I got one of the items and I realized it's a lot bigger than I expected LMAO NOW I TOO MUCH FOOD TO EAT!   One thing I got was pork cutlet with rice. The pork cutlet sauce is weird. It smells heavily like apple pie filling from McDonald's or something... the piece of pork itself is okay. However, the strong sauce is a major factor in me not wanting to eat it.   Second item was the salmon and avocado poke with spicy mayo. It was fantastic. I thought the portion would be smaller but wow it surprised me! I ate all of it (besides the ginger). I really liked the crispy popped rice(?) it had many textures that go well together!  Last thing was a Japanese roasted green tea milk tea. It's probably my favourite of the 3 things I got today! It was sweet but not too sweet and it's smooth helps cool down the left over spice from that mayo sauce."}
{"text":"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our time in this small little Cafe. It had modern decor, flavored water(different fruits), and fantastic service.   Have much deliberation, we ended up ordering two items. One was the cheese Udon and the another was an off menu item, which was a modification of the oyakodon. The chef adjusted the order to be instead of chicken, he gave us pork slices. This ended up being a fanastic decision. The modified oyakodon was definitely something I recommend when you arrive.  The most surprising part was the milk tea that you can combo with anything. We ordered it with the least sugar(1/3) and it was probably more sweet than a 100% sugar somewhere else. That isn't a bad thing though, since it's not an over powering sweetness, but an amplifier of the milk tea flavour. I will definitely drop by here more often just for the milk tea!"}
{"text":"Pretty interesting cafe tucked in at the lower level of the condos.   I ordered the kale noodles with salmon, I've asked for the salmon to be torched. The avocado were fresh, and my mom commented that there were lots of salmon sashimi.   The second item that I ordered was the pork ramen, I find the ramen a little bland so I had to add chilli powder to add flavour.  The salmon soup rice was not bad, large portion. Quite filling. My dad is diabetic so when we order a coffee, they didn't have any substitute sugar. Overall, not a bad experience, interesting cafe to try."}
{"text":"For the price; food is awesome & good service!  BBQ Pork = must try!  It's a nice little place if you want Japanese style meal but not the typical sushi."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe in an unsuspecting building.   Service is friendly and efficient. I've tried their ramen, poke bowls, and kale noodles.   Ramen is decent and surprisingly cheap, but there are so many other places in Markham that specialize in ramen.   Poke bowls are really good. The portions are pretty big and the fish is fresh. You can choose the sauce you want (wasabi soy, spicy mayo, spicy sesame). The toppings seem to change because in the photos displayed around the cafe are different than the food you are served. I suppose it's based on whatever is in season.   Their kale noodles are probably my favourite thing here. They're served cold, but it's really unique in flavour and texture. It's served with a spicy sesame sauce that goes really well with everything.  Definitely a place to check out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"It is ridiculously difficult to find poke ANYWHERE in Markham.  If anyone knows another poke place, LET ME KNOW!  Food:  I got the SMOKED SALMON POKE BOWL (5/5).  The salmon was fresh and lightly torched.  The bowl came with cucumbers, avocado, Japanese seaweed salad, and cherry tomatoes.  Very satisfactory poke bowl.   My friend got the SALMON AVOCADO POKE BOWL (5/5).  The sauce that they put on this bowl made subtle differences, so definitely worth trying as well.  Location:  A little far away from central Markham area, as it's on 16th and Main Street Markham.  Price:  The Smoked Salmon poke bowl was only 12.99, which is the standard price for poke bowls all around, whereas the Salmon Avocado was 10.99  Comparable: There is a poke bowl at IZAKAYA TSUKI that is sooo good, and made with purple rice, but much pricier, especially if you want to have it be an all-salmon bowl.  Check out my review for them!   Poke at POKE EATS is very good as well, but soo far."}
{"text":"Will never go back. I am pretty sure they will close down very soon. I literally threw the foods in the garbage (I ordered pork cutlet and torched sushi)"}
{"text":"got curry udon and it was awesome . don't have to pay tip so it's good because you go up to order . Prices are ok but the portion is small which is why I took of one star. all the food is about $10-$15 here  Do not recommend chicken teriyaki the sauce taste like alcohol Overall cute place and I'd go again"}
{"text":"Poke bowls exist uptown and this is the go to place for it!  I got the Salmon Avocado Poke bowl. It had some tempura bits underneath it with the rice. The Salmon was fresh and the avocado was perfectly ripe. The portion size was great and generous. It also includes a dressing on the side, I picked the Japanese dressing, which tasted like soy sauce mixed with wasabi, sugar, and something else. It blended well with the poke bowl. Added a hot beverage, Earl Grey, with my meal as well for $2. I wouldn't mind coming here again to try their ramen or rice bowls.  The only thing I didn't really like about the place was that the seating was a bit dirty. It's hard to maintain when you're using fabric seat covers over chairs. Maybe just stick with regular chairs?"}
{"text":"We were glad to find this quaint little place that has ramen!  Another option for lunch. My husband is pretty picky about his poke bowls and I was surprised when he said it (the salmon) was one of the best ones he's had so far. I mean we've had some pretty darn good ones from the source itself in Hawaii. All the ingredients were very fresh.   I had the tonkatsu ramen. The egg was pretty nicely done. Not the best I've had but up there in Markham. At least the whole egg was flavoured. The noodles were pretty good but the pork could have been tastier and it was a bit dry. For me it was a good portion but I can see how for some it may be perceived as being small.   Their black milk tea has good flavour too. Not watered down either."}
{"text":"Fresh and delectable. This is a tiny café with lots of natural lighting for Japanese dishes and poke bowls.   I had the torched salmon poke bowl which was super nice, but portion sizes were a bit small. Ingredients were fresh and the torched taste was a little mild but otherwise, it's good bang for your buck. I'd have liked more fish though but don't we all!   Dude had salmon rice in soup which looked OK and he said it was a 3* experience.   My 3* were from good ambience, portion size, and taste of torched salmon. I think they need to torch it a few seconds longer for that smokey feel.   Def recommend this place, though. Service could have been better for such a small place."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday evening and I had to wait for seating (we were a party of 7).  This place isn't that big so if you do come here, I suggest you order it as take out.    As for the food quality, it is good.  I particularly liked the Oyakodon (a bed of rice with chicken and egg).  My wife ordered the salmon avocado and that dish wasn't bad either.  We also ordered the Green Tea Latte (which has a lot of matcha)   Where it loses marks for me (and I debated between a 3 star or a 4 star) is the price and service.  Price-wise, I felt it was a little bit expensive for a cafe like this.  As for service, they twice on separate occasions forgot my friend's orders.  This business is fairly new so there is a bit of growing and learning to do."}
{"text":"I really like the simplicity of Komeya Cafe. It's a simple dine-in/take out place with a simple menu where you can just enjoy something easy and quick.  I ordered the torched salmon avacado poke bowl and was pleased with the dish. The salmon is blow torched for a nice cooked and slightly charred texture and was coated in a sweet unagi sauce while the spicy mayo I ordered was on the side in a small container. That was really interesting but I enjoyed it like that so you could control the amount. Their spicy mayo was great; it was thicker than your usual and you could tell of the many components in there by the granular apperance. There were a lot of sweet components in the bowl, from the ginger, the seaweed, and of course the unagi sauce, so those if you who like sweet things would love this bowl. The rice had crispy tempura bits well dispersed which added a lovely crunch and lightness to the rice.   Water and utensils were self-serve and I liked how there was hot water here as well. I'll definitely be back, there's not too many places to get poke bowls in Markham!"}
{"text":"Updated their menu to include curry options. We ordered a curry udon which was pretty good for a non-Japanese owned place.  We also ordered a ramen. The egg was the only good part. It was flavourful and cooked to a jellied yolk. However, the pork was super tough and very bland. Not a speck of seasoning. It was a generous portion, but it didn't taste good.  Salmon poke bowl is great. Always a crowd pleaser and kale noodle is a good option if you want to switch it up."}
{"text":"Love this cafe in the neighbourhood! I always come here for the Poke Bowls! It is like those DT shops. Healthy and tasty! Wish they have brown rice too though."}
{"text":"My go-to restaurant! Komeya is a cute small cafe located on Main Street Markham under a group of apartments. They offer poké bowls, ramen, rice, and many more. I've been here several times but I always manage to go back to the salmon poké bowl drizzled with spicy mayo. Inside this dish, there is seasoned seaweed, avocado, tomato, ginger, fresh salmon, and little crunchy bits. The flavours blend together amazingly with a touch of spiciness.   The employees there are very kind and welcoming. On my first visit, I even had a chat with one of the ladies and she took the time to ask me what I ordered, how was it, and her recommendations for next time.  I honestly recommend everybody try this restaurant out because you definitely won't regret it!"}
{"text":"First Impressions ============= A little chaotic, it was the weekend and people were zipping in and out. Tables at the time we're not cleaned and stuff was kinda left sitting around for a while.   Food ==== Ordered Ramen & Donburi  Ramen: A little under seasoned for my taste.  The Pork was good!  But the soup was a bit bland.  It was creamy, and the texture FELT rich.  And so it looked the part and it smelled the part, but when you put it in your mouth...the broth was a bit disappointing...  Donburi: Good.  No complaints.  Drinks: We ordered Coffee & Bubble Tea.  Coffee was good bubble tea--not so much.  Would I come back? =============== If we were in the area I would not be opposed to giving it another go!"}
{"text":"I love the poke bowls here and the different sauces you can add to it. The prices are pretty good if you consider all the different ingredients they add to just one bowl ($11.99 and up), and the serving size is fair. The place is a little difficult to find if you are not used to the area. Their hot ginger milk tea is the best I've had in Markham, and the black milk tea is also very nice. To those complaining about how small the place is... rent isn't exactly cheap in Markham."}
{"text":"This is a cozy restaurant in the neighbourhood. I got the Salmon Avocado Poké bowl with hot milk tea. The food portion size is generously a lot for me. I had difficulty clearing the entire bowl, it took me 1 hour, lol.  We went in around 7pm, wasn't too busy. But after 7:30, it did get busy. A few takeouts and dine-ins. Here and there.   The wasabi soy sauce was a little salty for me. I made the mistake of dumping the entire sauce in. Next time, I'll pour a little.  The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I like this little quiet, cute and comfortable Chinese owned - Japanese restaurant.   The service is good. After you order at the counter and find a seat the server will bring you your meal and is very attentive. She fills up your water and is very courteous.   I ordered the torched salmon poke with wasabi soy sauce with a milk tea but they made a mistake and made mine with spicy mayo. The server realized it right before giving it to me but I told him I'd just take it.  The dish was really good. It has a good mix of ingredients and flavours. They added crunch to the dish by adding deep fried tempura batter bits to the rice which was a good contrast to the soft textures of the rest of the dish.  They forgot our milk tea orders but rectified it after mentioning it to them but I didn't mind too much during our meal.   Even with the 2 mistakes they made I'd still come back here. They are kind people serving good food at a decent price."}
{"text":"VENUE/AMBIANCE (4) Adequate parking, limited seating. This small restaurant seats approximately 16-20 guests. There is some bar seating by the window. Decor is quite minimal, but everything is new and clean.   SERVICE (3)  Not much service to speak of. On our first visit, we walked up to the counter to ask how to order. The lady behind the counter was a woman of few words. So here's the rundown for first-time visitors: save yourself a seat then order at the counter. They'll bring your food over when it's ready. You're expected to clean up after yourselves when you're finished and stack your trays by the return counter.   FOOD (4)  Limited menu, which is quite alright - just poke bowls, dons, ramen, and some beverages. I'd rather they do a few things well than to serve a wide array of mediocre food. We ordered the Smoked (read: Torched) Salmon Avocado Bowl and a Salmon Avocado Kale Noodle. She asked what sauce I wanted but did not ask for the second order. The wasabi soy sauce is sweet and tangy but did not taste anything close to wasabi. The kale noodles came with what we guess was a sesame sauce. The food itself is pretty tasty and fresh. The kale noodles were surprisingly good -  chewy and soaked up the sauce well. The portions are average-size, small for the price they charge. I do appreciate that they include avocado already. Iced coffee was standard at $3.25 to add onto our meal.   QUALITY/VALUE (3.5) Quality was great. The avocado was ripe, the rice cooked perfectly, the salmon fresh. I only wish the prices were a little more commensurate with the quantity of food and location.   OVERALL (3.5)  I did really enjoy the food and expect to return. Komeya is a pleasant addition to the area."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyable and welcome addition to the neighbourhood!  We've been there just once, admittedly.  However, service was great.  Easy ordering and the food came quickly. We found the wood chopsticks and plastic cutlery a little awkward only because they felt short and bendy.  The bowls are beautiful and deep so the spoon was flexing a lot under the weight of the food when you try to dig down.  We're also not particularly nimble chopstick users. The milk tea got a big thumbs up from my husband. Ordered: - milk tea which was yummy - salmon avocado poke bowl with kale noodles.  Due to the deepness of the bowl it truly doesn't *look* like a lot but I had to throw in the towel and get a take out container.  Really delicious.  A lot of salmon, nice crispy bits, the noodles were delicious...al dente and saucy. - curry chicken, again, it didn't look like a lot and my husband was hungry but it really did the job.  Also very tasty.  This is a small space.  We went just before noon and had no trouble finding seating."}
{"text":"Me and my family ate at this restaurant. I had the salmon avacado bowl. If was very tasty. We also had the spicy chasu soup noodle. I didn't get to taste that because my son ate it all. It must have been very good. Can't wait to go again next time.."}
{"text":"I gotta admit, I only came here because it's like 5 mins walking from my house... I ordered a tonkatsu ramen, the portion is not big but the soup is very rich. I was really surprised the the pieces of meat(2slices) were really small and thin in which it cost 8.99 and additional 2$ for the black milk tea. I don't mind it since I don't eat crazy lot, however I believe it can be better.   The location is very convenient for me so that's a personal +++ for me, prices I would say average but the portion of ramen can be increase by tiny bit. Milk tea was tasty and reasonable. The ambiance of this location is pretty good, it's not a big lot but enough to fit about 20 I would say!?   If you just want a quick bite, and location is convenient, then go for it, it seems poke bowl are more popular, I only got to try the tonkatsu ramen so this review is only for that and for the store ambiance and so on. I will come back to give it a try to their other menus."}
{"text":"Overall 2.5 stars.  I round it up to 3 stars because it is new.  As many have stated, this place has potential, but it is not there yet.  I patronized at around 2:30pm on a Saturday.  I ordered a Salmon Poke Bowl.  The order took long, considering I was the only food customers (there were 4 customers ordering drinks).  The bowl looked pretty, and there were lots of toppings, hence the picture looked good.  The toppings and the sauce tasted all right.  It was too bad that the rice crumbed together in small balls, and slightly cold, as if it was in fridge for a while.  I wished the cook spent some time breaking down the crumbs.  Just a little bit of work yet it would have made a world of difference.  As it was, I didn't enjoy it."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times in the last 2 weeks. Their portions are good and the tuna/ salmon is fresh.  Would recommend to friends and family. :)"}
{"text":"Great food with good price for a nice lunch. Small cafe with a cozy environment. You should get a try! Cheers."}
{"text":"I really liked my experience at Komeya Cafe! It's a quiet, cozy spot to work without too many distractions.   You can find it on the west side of Markham Road and just south of Bur Oak. It's part of an apartment complex I believe? But it can be easy to miss. The place itself isn't very big as well.  This place is family-run and it shows, in a nice way. There are cute little touches here and there - the signs are clearly drawn by a kid. Service was courteous and pretty hands-off - utensils and water you can get by yourself.  The menu includes a range of things like poke, ramen, and drinks. I went for the salmon avocado poke because there are not very many options in Markham for poke! I chose the unagi sauce but there are others you can choose as well. It ended up being about 12 dollars.  The bowls are not customizable like most poke places are though I'm sure you could ask. I was pretty satisfied with my bowl - portions were big and there was quite a bit of fish! It came with seaweed salad, cherry tomatoes, avocado, tempura bits, ginger, and lots of salmon. It was a really filling and clean it and it was surprisingly quite satisfying!  It wasn't super busy on a Sunday afternoon as it is a bit out of the way in a quiet area. But there was still a steady amount of customers and I was able to stay there for 3 hours and be productive. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My mum and I wanted to grab a quick bite to eat around the area and stumbled into this little Japanese cafe. It was quaint and clean and the menu is pretty concise which makes it easier to choose. I got the curry chicken udon and my mum got the tonkatsu ramen, both were good. My mum liked that the ramen want to fly I as with most ramen places, the curry was full of flavour and together with the udon didn't seem like paste. I also got the ginger milk tea which was pretty good - was pretty spicy with half the sugar. I thought they would also serve pastries and such as they are a cafe but the owner said it's coming soon. All in all, not a bad experience. Would definitely go back to check out their pastries when they come out with them."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab some quick Japanese style rice and Poke bowls. Good service and clean simple environment. Cafeteria style serice. Good for a quick bite.  I had a Salmon poke with kale noodle last time and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Got to try out this new spot in Markham over the weekend, this place looked very interesting and promising from what others have said and the photos of the food looked very delicious too.   Located right below a condo tower next to multiple commercial units this place is a small restaurant that accommodates around 15 to maybe 20 people so the space is not that big and quite limited if you want to sit there and eat. They have quite a variety of different don bowls, ramen and they also have poke bowls as well. I came here to try their torched poke bowl which was very interesting, since there's hardly any poke places in Markham and they serve torched bowls too which is huge for the area.    The bowls are deep which allows to pack more food. I had gotten take out since there was no space to sit at the time. The bowls came with a good amount of rice, and toppings. I really liked how they gave full cherry tomatoes in this bowl which many places do not do that since it's not a cheap ingredient to add. There was avocado, seaweed salad and lots of ginger lol... They also gave the spicy mayo in a small container to separate it from the rest of the bowl to give some quality control on how much sauce you may want.    Overall taste wise, the torched bowl was very yummy.  Good flavour and nice choice of toppings they give in the bowls. I just wish they had more choice in choosing the kind of rice for the bowl, like there's either brown or white rice. Also maybe ease off on the ginger as well as it was a bit too much. Rice to fish ratio.. It would always be nice to have more fish than rice but it's the norm as fish is expensive and rice is cheap. Overall good first time experience would need to come back to try out their don bowls next."}
{"text":"I had the torch tuna avocado poke bowl which tasted fantastic! The customer service and food were both great!"}
{"text":"Was really impressed by the quality of the food.  I ordered the torched salmon poke bowl and found it to be a good portion and fresh ingredients.  It is comparable to the many downtown Toronto poke restaurants but a plus that is it right in my neighbourhood!  I will ask for less sauce next time since I found it to be drenched with sauce but that is my own preference.  The place was not busy on a Saturday evening but maybe because it is new and unknown yet.  I hope to come back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Quiet and clean. The actual food looked better than the picture on the wall Lol. Nonetheless, the salmon and tuna poke bowls were great, worth the price."}
{"text":"Just come with my sister and bf. This café is a little spot tucked away on the ground floor of a condo. The staff are friendly and professionals. The food and drinks came to our table quickly. I ordered a Torched Salmon Avocado Poke Bowl and a Iced House Blended Black Milk Tea. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Poke bowls were delicious and filling too! Prices also highly reasonable."}
{"text":"Checked this out today just because it was near home. The food is a lot better than I thought, I got the torched salmon and avocado poke bowl. Everything was really fresh! The place is a bit small, but simce it's so close to home, rake out works just fine as well!"}
{"text":"I came on a weekend for dinner and was extremely skeptical at first. They seem to have adopted a fast casual order and seating system but all food items have extended prep time and are served in dine in dinnerware. There was no 4 people table and the staff kinda looked at us like deers in headlights so we were debating where else to be for dinner. The owner lady came and immediately offered to move two folding tables for us. Service was likewise frantic, other than the owner, staff generally were not knowledgeable and noticeably lack any kind of hospitality experience. Food however was delicious. I got the Japanese pork with egg on rice and it was tasty with a perfect runny egg. My mom had the salmon soup rice which is a rare menu item but a Japanese comfort food staple. My sister had the curry udon. All our party enjoyed the food. Portions were very generous. The black milk tea was also great and not inferior compared to any bbt franchise. The owner later came to apologize about the slow service and came for feedback on the food. She was down to earth, fun and genuine, which is what I love about many small businesses. I would love to come back for the food and to support local businesses in Markham."}
{"text":"Pros: great food, good portion sizes, aesthetically pleasing, friendly staff, nice music selection, short wait time for the food Cons: difficult to find location, everything is self serve, small place  My friend and I decided try Komeya Cafe after reading some reviews on Yelp. The location was difficult to find since the actual sign was hard to notice so we circled around the building a couple of times before finding it. When we finally got in, there was nobody at the front so we weren't sure if we were supposed to wait for someone to come tell us where to sit, or go to the counter and order food first. Eventually, we figured it out and went to the counter to order food.    Since my friend and I are both vegetarians, we ordered the Spicy Kale Cold Noodle, and the Sea Salt Ramen. They were both delicious, and the portion sizes were perfect for us. Prices are relatively cheap (around $8-12 depending on the dish), with a combo deal of $2 for black milk tea.   Final Thoughts: Overall, I think the food was great, the cafe is pretty, and the staff are quick. The owner even let us sample handmade chocolate and caramel milk tea (which was sooo good!).  Improvements: The cafe would be even better if they added signs to show customers what to do (for example, tell people to order first, then sit).  Would I go again?:  For sure! :)"}
{"text":"Came here because my girlfriend recommended it. There's not many seats but the place is spacious - there should be enough space to add some more seats.   They were in the middle of changing their menu items and only had a few food items. I ended up getting the Spicy BBQ Salmon Avocado poke bowl. The portion is good and liked that the salmon was torched. Also got an Americano which was decent. Interesting mix of different foods having Japanese food + pastries + bubble tea + coffee."}
{"text":"Great place to eat especially if you are commuting from mount joy station, only a walk across the street away or simply if you want are craving some Japanese food, coffee, tea. Simple and easy :)"}
{"text":"I have seen this restaurant as I drove by the area & have been wanting to give it a try for awhile & now finally did.  Came in on a weekday afternoon with a friend.  The place was empty with only one staff at the front.  Friendly greeting, clean place.  Only I ordered the ramen..friend wasn't that hungry. Ramen tasted good, but nothing out of the ordinary nor nothing to wow about.  Half way into my meal, the staff came over to us & offered the VIP card.  Hope there will be more customers here soon.  Would I come back again?  Possibly"}
{"text":"I gave this place a try during their soft opening and only got a drink the first time around and thought it was decent. Went back for some food and was pretty satisfied.  The owner was extremely friendly and helpful when selecting the items on the menu. I opted for the Salmon Avocado Poke bowl and my mom chose the BBQ Pork with Runny egg on rice. The owner triple checked if the BBQ Pork was OK for my mom because she advised the Pork was half fatty and half meat trying to be health conscious.  The ingredients in the poke bowl were fresh and I liked the little tempura bits in the rice. It added a nice crunch to the meal. I chose the wasabi sauce for the bowl but didn't notice it much. Could have used more.  The bbq pork bowl was also pretty good. The Pork was tender and juicy. The rice was lacking some flavour despite there being sauce on it.  Overall a pretty decent place I'd recommend giving a try. It's nice to have this option when I live 5 minutes away!"}
{"text":"The poke bowl is obviously not as authentic as the downtown one's but for its location and quality, I would come here again. It is a cute little cafe with attentive staff and fast service, I am looking forward to another poke bowl if I am craving it and I am not downtown!"}
{"text":"First of all, the name was kind of confusing, calling themselves a 'cafe' but doesn't have the wide variety and selection that a usual cafe would.  I understand that they are new (only opened just over a month ago) and are probably still trying to figure out what works and what doesn't but the name was a bit misleading.  Anyhow I visited this place on a Saturday afternoon around 3pm.  Ordered the tonkatsu ramen and was truly disappointed.  Was expecting a bowl of ramen but the soup was lukewarm.  The flavour of the soup and ramen texture were pass-able, but the pork belly was a disaster - 3 dry slices that were clearly sitting out for some time.  The lean parts of the pork was so try I had to fight to bite it apart!  The only saving grace was the egg, which was cooked to perfection.    This is a generous 2 star and wouldn't be visiting again anytime soon .   I am hoping they read their reviews and make adjustments accordingly.  This area of Markham is in dire need of a ramen house so there is a market - They just need to step up their game!"}
{"text":"The poke trend had reached markham finally!! My sister and I ventured up after she said she'd never had poke....time to rectify this immediately.  The good - Lots of free parking available. -Server was so lovely and helped us navigate the menu and even recommended sauces and add ons and substitutions. - Great coffee selection on hand - Very attentive servers who Che led up on us and the server even asked how we enjoyed everything. - Cozy place..intetior is so cute. - Fresh delicious beautifully played good.  The bad - Very pricy but then again this is seafood?! -Tiny spot with limited seating.  I'll be back for sure...yelpers head on over!"}
{"text":"came here a couple times and tried the curry chicken udon and tonkutso ramen. i give the chicken curry udon 5/5 but tonkutso ramen 2/5.  the chicken curry udon is delicious and the curry sauce is the best curry sauce ever and the chicken is perfect! the tonkutso ramen doesn't have a lot of flavour but the meat in it was ok. if ur looking for good ramen then this is definitely not the place to go. i hear their poke bowls are very good but i'm not rlly into poke bowls so i can't comment on that. the atmosphere and service is good, overall good but only 4 stars bc i am disappointed in the ramen."}
{"text":"Pretty good for an uptown poke location. Maybe because I've been to other cities to try their poke bowls, I found that this bowl was just average. I would prefer that we got to customize our own bowl with the side dish contents.   I could tell that the owners and those who served really cared about the food and the quality of service. This is applaud them for. The lady at the counter also offered to let me try the sauces before putting it on my bowl, which I felt was very kind and considerate.  Their fish is also fresh and was generally delicious. Overall the bowl was a solid 3 Star. The service though was very personable and so I gave them an extra star.  Don't expect to find seating during peak hours. This seemed to be more of a grab and go restaurant."}
{"text":"Giving this place 3.5 rating. Ambience is cute, quaint and clean. Food is good and clean as well, but nothing extraordinary. Basically, no complaints about anything. You come here for convenience and a nice place to chat. I believe the owners are Chinese, so their ramen is definitely not up to par with authentic Japanese places, but it gets the job done. Owners and servers are extremely nice. Would come back since the location works for us.   My husband and I each ordered a tonkatsu ramen. The menu consists of poke bowls, udon and a variety of speciality teas. All look good (but again, nothing extraordinary).   The place is located on the ground floor of a condo across Markham Subaru."}
{"text":"Pok bowl was small but tasty.  self serve format which fine.  not alot of sitting its more a take out place."}
{"text":"What a cute cafe that is so hidden beneath a residential complex!  Again, I have to thank my fellow Yelpers for this recommendation...there was no way I would have found this place on my own.  I absolutely can't find anything to criticize about this place.  Great selections of poke, rice, noodle bowls and coffee/latte/tea.  The owner/chef is Chinese and has done a really good job of creating these Japanese dishes.  It was also very nice to have the place all to ourselves since coming at 10:30am today on Saturday morning was probably a little early for most people to have rice or noodles.  The rice/noodles menu starts at 11am but since they had the food prepared, we were able to order anything from the menu.  We got the Chicken teriyaki and Torched Salmon Poke bowls.  For additional $3, you can pick any specialty hot/cold latte or tea.  The place is small with a few tables that can seat about 20 people.  It has a very a cozy and relaxing atmosphere.  I like the music variety, with a mix of French jazz and Japanese pop.  We will definitely be back if we are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5 This place is located on Markham Rd. and Bur Oak Ave. across the street from Markham Subaru. There is a small parking lot outside, but I never ran into issues with parking.   [SERVICE] - 4/5 Café-style service, so you pay at the counter before you sit down. Staff were very friendly and efficient.   [DÉCOR] - 3.5/5  They added more tables for dine-in customers since they opened last year. Decor is a little too bland in my opinion, but if you like to take pics of your food, the lighting is really good near the bar stools in front of the window!   [QUALITY] - 4/5 High-quality in fresh ingredients in their poke bowls. Perfect for a light meal or a snack!   [ORDER] - 4/5 Salmon Avocado Poke Bowl - $10.99: This bowl was SO PRETTY! For sauce, I chose the nutty and delicious \"Spicy Creamy Sesame Sauce.\" Salmon sashimi was soft and fresh. Avocado was creamy and ripe. Seaweed salad, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, and pickled ginger added a light and fresh taste to this colourful concoction!   [OVERALL] - 4/5  I would definitely recommend Komeya Café to those who enjoy poke bowls! The spicy creamy sesame sauce took the dish to the next level as it complemented every ingredient very well."}
{"text":"You can tell the owners really try their best here. They are friendly (can come off a bit awkward but means well). The place is small and seems to still be in the middle of decor... some empty shelves and very bare walls. There are only high chairs by the window, maybe 6 seats? At least for now. The menu focuses on poke bowls, japanese food and bbt/ tea. I tried their spicy cold kale noodles and torched salmon pokebowl. Its no hawaii poke bowls... but if you want a quick bite and quality ingredients, this is a good spot. The kale noodle is actually in poke bowl style. It has avocado, corn, seaweed salad, ginger, cucumber and their pokebowl dressing... all in a bowl with the noodles! The noodle is cooked perfectly, just chewy enough. I would ask for less dressing next time though. It becomes a bit too heavy from the creaminess.  The torched salmon bowl has all the same toppings but the salmon wasnt too torched or torched enough. Again just too much dressing. You can tell from their avocado and seaweed salad  (and even their takeout containers) that they use better ingredients/stuff.   I would come back and support them!"}
{"text":"Great place for some coffee and tea. Came here at 10am, the barista gave us some sample to try, the rooibos cream and the Japanese roasted green tea. It's an adorable Japanese cafe. They serve ramen, rice and poke bowls from 11am. Will definitely have to come back and give it a try."}
{"text":"Ordered the salmon avocado poke bowl. Comes with rice, ginger, grape tomatoes, cucumber, seaweed salad, avocado and salmon sashimi. I might have missed a few other things. What I like about it is the serving size. It gives you enough, which although you want to eat until you're full, there's a lot of over eating when you eat out. You choose the sauce you want. I chose spicy mayo which also comes with eel sauce. 2 for 1, booyah! I think if it weren't for my sauce choice, it would-be been quite a healthy meal. Will definitely come back and try out the other menu items."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for poke bowls in Markham. I had the torched salmon avocado poke bowl with eel sauce and spicy mayo on the side. It came with a bit of seaweed salad as well. There were medium-sized chunks of salmon in the bowl covered in eel sauce. You can taste a bit of the torched flavour though not that much. Nonetheless, the ingredients were balanced and delicious. I especially liked the tempura bits in the rice because it gave it a nice crunch to contrast the smoother textures of the fish, avocado, and rice.   I added the black milk tea to the meal for $2 and I really enjoyed it. It was a smooth, creamy milk tea that was sweet and did not taste of evaporated milk as is commonly used in other restaurant milk teas.  The tables and chairs used didn't seem to fit with the decor as they looked like they were meant for outdoors but honestly, you're not going to Komeya Cafe for a romantic night out. The food is enough to compensate for any aesthetic concerns. I'll definitely be back to try their other items."}
{"text":"2.5 star   Komeya Cafe is quite new and welcome to the neighbourhood!  I do like the location right across from Mount Joy Go Station and underneath a condo development. I was hoping this will be something like Red Bulb in Stouffville. People would able to get a morning coffee then hop on the Go Train/Bus.  Maybe it is my mistake.... I should not have that much expectation for a \"authentic\" Poke Bowl?! I would have had a lower expectation if my Salmon Avocado Poke is not costing me $11.99!! It was at $9.99 but I guess the price had increased since their \"Grand Opening\" (Their grand opening banner still up in the store front) ? This cost more than a \"real\" poke joint would have charged downtown for pick your own protein, base, 3 toppings and all garnish. I now paying for a standard one with no custom alternation. But if it is good?   After they microwaved my sushi rice, I was given a slightly warmed poke to go. By the time I was eating it, some of the salmon was a little cooked from the warmed rice. And why so much soy sauce?! I was a little confused! Maybe Markham people is not deserving to have something decent even if we are paying 20% marked up!  I would not be coming here with the 4/5 star reviews from my fellow Yelpers. But I don't think Komeya Cafe is worth that high a rating. Work on improving your products and offers your customers a fair price and maybe in the future there will be a real 4/5 star cafe in this neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Average food, insufficient service, overpriced.  I'm SHOCKED by the positive reviews and I truly believe they're misleading. I'm guessing most of them came from friends and family.   The quality of the food doesn't justify the higher than average price they listed. The menu items were mostly not available when we got there - that was a let down. The lack of service blew my mind - waited 10+ minutes before any of the staff spoke to us and there were only 3 actual paying customers in the cafe at the time.   Don't waste your time and money here. There are better restaurants in the area that deserve your business."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Big portion of Poke, it was very yummy. Finally, Poke came to Markham. We ordered salmon avocado and tuna avocado Poke bowls. They sashimi were fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Small place for take out with few seats to eat in. There are not much choice but what they have in the menu were all good. We order 3 dishes and 3 dishes were good, I believe their other dishes would be good too."}
{"text":"Salmon poke ball was recommended by the staff and was told $3 extra can get me roasted milk tea so I gave it a try. Salmon poke ball came out to be very presentable. The overall taste was alright. Only thing I did not like was the rice. It was hard and cold.   My friend ordered the pork cutlet with rice and it was bland. Would not recommend getting it.   Staff was friendly and food came out quick   Their price is a bit expensive for what they serve.   Might come back once in a blue moon."}
{"text":"This cafe showed promise, but decided to throw it in the trash.  I first came here with my best friend for her birthday. Happy 18th Birthday Duckie!! n.n  We ordered the oyakodon, salmon avocado poke bowl, and tonkotsu ramen. The oyakodon was honestly the best donburi I've had to this day. The meat was succulent and well-flavored, the egg was beat to perfection and produced a light match to the protein, and the rice just completed this perfect dish. The salmon avocado poke bowl was slightly unproportionate, offering too much rice for the salmon to handle. The tonkotsu ramen stuck together, the broth was nothing special.  Since then, I've returned several times and to my dismay, they no longer serve their oyakodon. :((  I tried their chicken curry udon and their chicken teriyaki rice and again, nothing special. Also, I find that their noodles and rice sticks together under their sauces and toppings, not a good sign.  The extra star is a tribute to the delicious oyakodon that this cafe once served :'("}
{"text":"Very limited seating under the condo and food not too impressed. Tried to order noodles off the menu and was told they don't have it and it was lunch time. So they tried to substitute it with something else. When the food arrived the food wasn't overly impressive, there weren't a lot of ingredients for the price of ramen.   Also ordered coffee latte and it seems too sweet for what it is.   Would I go back? Probably not. Price for food I can probably find a better deal elsewhere."}
{"text":"poke bowl is super yummy and filling - try it with the spicy kale noodles instead of rice :)"}
{"text":"My colleague recommended Komeya Cafe to me because she knows I love poke bowls. I came with my boyfriend on a Saturday for brunch (~1pm). The cafe is small but seats are well-spaced out so it doesn't feel crammed. The tables in the middle were taken by a group and the counter seats/bar seats were taken by a small group that walked in right before us.   We decided to order for dine-in as there were two small tables left (but people were coming in behind us). As we were ordering, the gentleman helping us quickly suggested one of us to sit down to \"reserve\" our table first. I thought that was nice of him :)  Our order consisted of Tonkatsu Ramen, Salmon Avocado Poke Bowl, cold earl grey milk tea & a hot black milk tea. Total ~$30. Pay first, get order # and they will bring the food to you.  Salmon Avocado Poke Bowl (with spicy mayo + eel sauce) - I thought the portions were huge. I had about 1/3 and I was full.  All the ingredients in the poke bowl complimented each other so well. The spicy mayo and eel sauce were a great combination. Plus, they have the excellent lighting for taking photos of this colourful dish ; )  Tonkatsu Ramen - This was my boyfriend's order. He thought the portion could've been larger but he was fine after finishing my poke bowl. I tried a little bit and thought that the noodles were a good texture. The broth is also very light and I probably could've drank it all : P. I thought the pork could be improved on.  Drinks - They were brought to me by a little boy, how cute! It's a nice family business. Both hot and cold drinks are given to you in take out cup (even when you're dining in). I actually prefer this because I'm a slow drinker so I was able to take it with me after our meal. The earl grey milk tea has a subtle earl grey flavour whereas I prefer it to be stronger. This almost tastes like a watered down version of the Earl Grey MT from Chatime.   Overall, I enjoyed the food but I think the drinks could be improved upon. I like the nice, relaxed atmosphere and friendly service. I already know I will be coming here often!"}
{"text":"I love the salmon avocado poke bowl especially with spicy mayonnaise and eel sauce. It's a decent price.  Am definitely coming back to try their wasabi dressing."}
{"text":"Had the salmon avocado poke bowl. I enjoyed it.  Really filling. I had it with the spicy mayo. Really enjoyed it.  Simple menu. Which is not bad. Small seating area."}
{"text":"Came to this place specifically for some poke so I ordered the salmon avocado bowl with wasabi sauce. I believe the sauce is a combination of soy sauce and wasabi as well as some sesame. It's a pretty small cafe, but you place your order at the front and the server would bring the food to your table. The lady that took our order was very nice (she seemed like some manager or owner) and knowledgeable about what sauce goes well with each dish. I'm not gonna deny the bowl does look very appealing, but I feel like the amount of ingredients you get in the bowl isn't worth it's high price ($12 or $13 depending on which bowl you get). It's salmon, avocado, some seaweed salad and veggies so not too special. Not sure if it's with all bowls, but there was way too much rice than toppings as well. So if you like simple styles and self serve options then try this place out you might like it."}
