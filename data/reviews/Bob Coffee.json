{"text":"Do you like being surrounded by pretentious, wayyyy-over-it douches? That's the question you have to ask yourself. Some people gravitate to that. If you like that, and you like to overpay for a nice atmosphere and location, great! If not, skip.

I am often in TO and work remotely, have been here a few times. The staff is SO much cooler than you are and they will get to you WHEN they get to you. Think what you would expect to pay for any item and then add $2-$4. The patrons are the people you would expect to gravitate to such a place, and need a LOT of attention. I sit in the window and look out or it's difficult to work, what with the staff and patrons needing everyone within sight to know how absolutely amazing and right-on they are.

Still, big windows and lots of sunlight, stools with backs... if you sit in the window and look out, you can work well and pretend you're not in the douche vortex."}
{"text":"Bob's is a great addition to the neighbourhood. It's a very sunny cafe, that has a ton of seating, with lots of access to outlets. The coffee is a little pricey, but quite good."}
{"text":"While the layout is great and the coffee is good, the service can be cold. In particular on this Saturday afternoon/evening , the barista thought it would be fitting to blast (at bar volume) heavy rock music. This defeats the purpose of showing up of spending $4 on tea to sit and enjoy the space."}
{"text":"Good baristas, attitude...But my God, clean your washrooms. Seriously, it seems like they are as dirty, one day to the next. You are serving food! And there is a restaurant next door. If your cleanliness improves, this review will change. Thanks."}
{"text":"Bob's cafe is a nice addition to the neighbourhood. As with any new establishment there are kinks that need to be figured out at the beginning. 

I came in on a Saturday morning around 10:30, about 2 weeks after it opened. Surprisingly, seats were all filled up. It was bustling with locals and had a fun and warm atmosphere. There were a couple of people working away on their laptops. 

The line was really short, just me and one other person; there was also another person who was waiting on her drinks. I ordered a mocha latte. I noticed that the people ahead of my had been waiting for their drink fro quite some time, and when it came to my order it was the same. Once I finally got it, it was luke warm and a bit on the milky side. Eventually, once I finished about 75% of it, I realized that it was milky bc the chocolate was sitting on the bottom! 

I will give this place a try in a couple of months when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I am quite surprised to see all the 2 star reviews on Yelp, and 4.5 stars on Google. 

This is a neighborhood caf√©. Come in for a coffee, light lunch or tea. Bring a laptop, friends or family - really anything goes here! Prices are comparable to Starbucks (maybe a little cheaper). The food items are all pre-made and they are heated/toasted once you order. Except the food is comparatively fresher than Starbucks. 

I discovered this place on a whim, so I didn't go in with any expectations. I had the Ziccihi soup, which came with toasted bread. The soup was good. Nothing overly special or complicated. Just simple and hearty. It was heated from the little to-go containers, which is fine by me. (BTW, the staff will not stick their finger in your soup to see if it's hot enough. If it's not, just ask them to heat it up some more!). The bread on the side was buttered and toasted - nice touch. The pressed sandwiches looked very good too. I didn't try the pastries, but they looked decent. 

I also had a London fog. Let me tell you, they do not cheap out with the tea. The flavor was spot on. $4 soup + $4 London fog - really not a bad lunch for $9 with tax at a neighborhood cafe. It's nicely decorated; I really liked the camper mug touch, and the roll of brown paper and crayons for energetic kids (or adults!). 

Service was fine. Both of the staff members were behind the counter and did their best to serve all the customers (it was quite busy), and they were nice. I am not sure what else one could expect from counter service? 

I'd definitely recommend it, and will go back myself."}
{"text":"2.5/5 
Shop is quaint and a nice addition to the neighbourhood considering Starbucks at both St Clair/Christie and Dupont/Christie. They have a good variety of coffee and non-coffee drinks

I had their americano this morning and it didn't taste as bold as I'd have liked it to be. Not sure if this had something to do with the amount of water the barista added or the amount of espresso. Service wasn't as friendly given there wasn't anyone in the shop other than someone who had ordered before me. The woman serving me didn't even crack a smile 

Ample seating area for the parent needing a caffeine fix while waiting for their child's birthday party to be done at Action Potential. 

Will consider this place again once they work out their kinks."}
{"text":"I'd ordered a London Fog this morning, that felt like they took forever to make. I was probably standing there for close to 10-15mins waiting for my order. The barista seemed as if she has forgot about my drink and started to take other customers orders. The other customers received their orders before mine.
After receiving my drink.  London fog was overly sweet and just warm (like Starbucks kids temperature) otherwise the favour was nice. 
I also order a almond croissant.. it was stale, and tasted like a mix of other pastries they had.

The service: the workers there seemed a bit stressed out. Didn't smile or make much of an effort to interact with the customers.

Otherwise, the coffee shop looks nice, has lots of natural lighting from multiple windows. Lots of places to sit."}
{"text":"Great espresso, good atmosphere. Nice place to hang out for a bit. Really glad to finally have a decent espresso bar in the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"This cafe is a very welcome addition to the neighbourhood.

Since I often sit here with a laptop to work, it's not really an issue for me if service is slow. Food isn't incredible, but good enough for a light snack. The cafe has a lot of natural light which is nice.

My only qualm, perhaps, is that the music can be a bit too loud."}
{"text":"Great service, great coffee and tea... it's a nice place. It's my fiend's favourite place for latte, located right at the corner you can relax, talk while you enjoy the aroma of the place and the view out side. I liked the cups"}
{"text":"This place definitely has some potential - it's a cute space (if a little contrived, as others have said), has a warm feel, and it's great to have a new addition to the area. The barista seemed nice, and I didn't have to wait long at all for my coffee (came on a rainy weekday afternoon).  

Cons: 
- Price: it's about $1.00-$1.50 more than I'm used to paying for coffee (my regular spot is $3 with tax for a cappuccino, and here it's $4 plus tax) 
- They charge extra for lactose free milk (I think $0.50, but they don't have this information posted on their price list, so it came as a surprise)
- Taste: coffee is meh. It's definitely not the worst. It has that slightly burnt espresso taste, which I know a lot of people like (I personally don't, so take this comment for what you will). 

Overall - it's a nice little spot; prices are comparable to Starbucks I guess, but more expensive  than a lot of other independent coffee shops in the city. I know they're fairly new, so I'm looking forward to seeing how things work out here."}
{"text":"Quality coffee, better than anything on St Clair. All in a cute house that blends into a mix of houses and greenery."}
{"text":"The dream of the 90's is alive at Bob Coffee. There's \"graffiti\". Vintage indie rock - think Oasis. Motorcycles. Bukowski. Nirvana vinyl! There's industrial metal shelving and spotlights and branding on every damn thing in the whole place. Everything here is for sale.

We visited Bob just a day after their grand opening. I waited a long time to order, not because of a long line, just super slow service. I waited even longer for my beverage, and while I waited I watched as the counter person forgot to give customer after customer their baked goods. The London Fog I ordered was very tasty, but I have no idea why it took so long to make. We also had a drip coffee, it was so acidic we only drank a third of the cup before throwing it out. 

There was a female barista, and a female counter person. As they worked, an unsmiling, unengaged man stood behind them and watched. He made no attempt to speak to any of the customers. I can only assume that he was the owner, supervising - but shouldn't the owner, on day two of business, make an effort to smile and say hi?

The unsmiling management only heightened the overbearing masculine energy of this place. It's all very smug, as if they are planning on franchising into the next Starbucks. I think it's supposed to be gritty, but it just seems contrived? Boring. Functionally, those metal shelves are at just the right height to put your kid's eye out. Despite this being a family heavy neighborhood (indeed, Bob is right across the street from Action Potential Lab!), there is no change table, not even a hook for your bag or coat in the basement washrooms. The ladies room had no toilet paper at all. Overall, the whole vibe was unfriendly. I like my coffee shops to be warm, cozy, welcoming, and inviting. Bob is not a place that I want to spend time in. Get  your coffee to go here."}
{"text":"Working in the area his morning. First time hereS Cozy feel. Lots of bar seats and singles working with their laptops around 11am.   I like the atmosphere. Friendly server. Flat white - will never order that from there again. It was more milk than even a latte should have. Will try their cappuccino if I go back."}
{"text":"Worst customer service experience of my entire life. Ate at their sister resto first and were then sent downstairs to this coffee bar for our after dinner coffee. The barista decided rather than serve is he would turn up the music tell us he was closing and informed us we had to leave. When we queried why the sister resto sent us down for coffee if we couldn't get a coffee he literally turned psycho on us. Passive aggressive is an understatement. It was literally surreal how aggressive and inappropriate he was with us...one of my dining companions is a doc and all three of Us wondered whether he was actually \"on\" something but our doc didn't think so...he was just totally emotionally out of control. My other companion likened him to jack Nicholson in the shining. His behaviour was so out of line and angry that we were actually scared. We are three middle aged women who live in this hood.... a doctor a lawyer and a teacher...we are all very well connected in this hood and you can be sure we will tell everyone we know never to go to this coffee bar."}
{"text":"New place in town that still has some kinks to sort out but the coffee was pretty good. Their London Fog is spot on and I've never been turned off by the staff. I don't understand the obnoxious reviews that have been posted by others but to each their own I guess. 

I haven't tried any food except for the pre packaged oatmeal, that was pretty good. 

The decor is pretty cool although the shelves they have by the counter could get in the way when busy.  Not a big deal. 

The prices are not bad for the most part but I can't be a good judge on the items I haven't tried. 

Place is quiet for the most part but can get loud when busy. Had a hard time having a conversation when there last because our table was too close to the next one so try to grab a seat on the couch if you're looking for better conversations. 

Over all I'd recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"I loved the decor. It was super cute and funky. The barista was friendly and the service was super fast. I ordered a London fog. I found the cup size a little small. The beverage was pretty good but the tea wasn't steeped enough and it wasn't hot enough. I loved that they used organic milk though. I would definitely go back and sit in this place again."}
{"text":"I stopped by Bob on a sunny Sunday afternoon to check out a new local spot. The atmosphere is nice and it was fairly busy; I liked the tables and wood counters, and they have cool merchandise on their shelves (books, mugs, Hale coffee, tea, etc). It looks like a nice place to hunker down and work, or have coffee with a friend. However, I ordered an Americano and my partner had a blueberry almond tart, and together, this came up to $10. To me that was too expensive for the quality, as neither was amazing - just average. It is a stylized hipster spot where the prices are higher than average for no discernible reason. It's a nice little spot overall, as this area lacks cafes, but I wouldn't come back often."}
