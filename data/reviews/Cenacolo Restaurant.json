{"text":"Had the Giglio pasta tonight. It was AMAZING! I usually don't write reviews, but I felt this dish exceeded expectations. Service was excellent!! Appreciate the attentiveness to our two children present as well. Thanks for making it a nice night out!"}
{"text":"Wasn't thrilled with the place! Very hard to find. And no lasagna!!  What the heck. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been to Italy on many visits and I find this place to be as much as Italy as  I have had. The food is just outstanding as  it is fresh. It's a must try."}

{"text":"Cenacolo Restaurant: It Might Just Be Your Last Supper

The last time we visited our friends in Erie, they took us to a charming Italian restaurant.  As I savored each bite, from appetizer to dessert, I racked my foodie mind to think of a comparable eatery in Pittsburgh.  Sure, we have Italian eats in the 'Burgh, but I was coming up short in thinking of the kind of spot that makes you ask the wait staff, \" Hey, is the owner's Nonna the executive chef?\"  Since then, I've made it my mission in the passing months to find said place.  That's right my foodie friends, I've suffered through mediocrity and Prego-inspired plates to find the best of the best.  Here is my conclusion, although the city limits of Pittsburgh is still lacking overall, you can treat yourself to an Italian getaway in North Huntingdon (wait...where?) when you visit Cenacolo Restaurant. 

Finding Cenacolo, which refers to the Last Supper, the first time can be a bit challenging (we ended up in the Post Office parking lot more than once).  It's not your typical restaurant locale and rightfully so. Fede Pasta, which has been making pasta for other restaurants since 2005, made the brilliant decision to open their own eatery this past October.  Rather than moving Cenacolo elsewhere, they built a restaurant and retail shop right within their wholesale distribution warehouse.  The retail shop is located in the center, offering a variety of pre-cooked pastas and house sauces for you to take home.  You can also purchase a seemingly endless variety of artisanal cheeses and cured meats at their \"deli\" counter.  On either side of the retail space, you'll find the dining areas...cozy spaces that remind me of tastefully decorated home dining rooms. 
The owners are very accommodating to parties of all sizes; our latest visit was a birthday celebration for eight.  While we did have to wait more than a bit for our reserved table, the staff was attentive while we wandered around the retail shop.  Our waiter even brought us wine glasses so we could imbibe, free of corkage fee, as we mused over the seasonally printed menu. 

Having time to consider the night's offerings, we were seated ready to order...or so thought.  While providing an overview of the menu, our waiter threw a delicious dilemma into the mix.  We could order individually as planned, or we could choose 3-4 items from the menu and be served larger, family style portions to share.  This was an offer we couldn't refuse. (Ok...truth...I almost refused...because I'm stingy and I didn't know if could share the Ricotta Gnocchi with Short Rib Ragu.) We needed more time to agree on our selections, so we did what any hungry mob of eight would do; we ordered the large charcuterie plate.  While you may opt to select your own...

{"text":"Fantastic restaurant in Banco Park. The homemade pastas were delicious and the menu had a good variety on it. BYOB was a plus, too!"}
{"text":"First time dining and the food was great but wildly overpriced. We clearly did not have the service the other patrons received. We were a party of two and the restaurant was rather empty and the hostess sat us next to a loud party with 4 extremely loud children. They were up and walking around the table and yapping at one another. I asked to be seated in another section. We moved but our waitress was terrible. She literally just asked what we wanted to drink and eat. Never asked us if we had been there before or explained the menu. I witnessed other wait staff being very attentive to their tables but not ours. She seemed bothered by us. Such a shame because the food is great but due to the prices and experience we won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Pretty impressive for the area, great pasta, will definitely return.

The bad news: 

The lighting was horrible, so bright you didn't even notice there were candles on the table. 

The menu is also confusing and misleading in that the pasta dishes come with a salad, but how would you know? It doesn't say anything about it on the menu. And the portion sizes are big enough for two to share. Again, how would you know? 

Also weird that they don't provide knives to cut your salad with. Annoying. 

The bread was good, but some olive oil for dipping would have improved the experience. 

And the fried artichoke appetizer was so heavily breaded, it was like eating bricks.

The arugala salad that comes with the pasta was good, but they serve it with a too-sweet balsamic dressing, which I personally didn't care for."}
{"text":"Wow what a nice restaurant! When I read the reviews that they make their own pasta, I had to try this place! Even though I don't normally seek out Italian restaurants. 

Attached to the restaurant is the pasta production side called Fede, and it makes for an interesting/unique set up. The dining area is very nicely decorated and the production area has that \"strip district\" feel. 

My meal came with bread, olives, and a side arugula salad. This was the first time I went, so I didn't anticipate the portion sizes, which were huge! I ordered the short rib gnocchi which could easily feed a family of 4! Lol the gnocchi was tender and well cooked and the short rib in the sauce was amazing! 

I went here for lunch, but it would be a perfect place to go on a dinner/lunch date with a bottle of wine, but I think I would enjoy it most with a family style dining experience.

If back in this area I would definitely come back to try the other fresh made pastas! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Obviously this place is not for everybody, that is why there are Apple-bees,( which I also enjoy now and then). However if you can appreciate  authentic, interesting dishes that a chef put a lot of thought into you will enjoy this establishment."}
{"text":"The food was great service was excellent, two things really bothered me about my dinner.  1st we did an early dinner and it seemed as though all the food orders just came in and the waiters and other employees were carrying all the cases and bags right past us which was really disturbing, 2nd don't trust the online reservation service on their website it does t work well at all.  You don't know if your reservation went through or not it says they will call you or send you an email to confirm and the do neither."}
{"text":"I had a birthday party here.  Called in advance to determine if we could order from menu or would we have to select a few dishes for the table and go \"family style.\"  I was told we could order from the menu individually.  When we tried to do so the waitress became surly.  She then told me it was up to the Chef whether we could order individually.  I had a diverse group and was concerned about everyone having to share main courses but we all decided to go along with sharing.  Next thing I know this huge man of a chef comes out and begins bullying me and behaved in a threatening way.  Even though others at the table spoke up for me - he was very abusive.  I stayed only because I had a group and didn't want to ruin everyone's night.  I will never and I mean never go back here.  Arrogant - rude and abusive -- and the pasta while good is drowned in sauce!!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal at this restaurant inside a pasta factory.  We had lobster ravioli, 4-cheese ravioli, and seafood ravioli with the mussels (huge) and fried artichoke.  The seafood folks won out over the cheese freaks. Portions are large.  They could reduce the size and the price and do better IMHO.  I'd definitely go again.  Restaurant area was kind of cramped, but aside from that, it was great and we bought fresh pasta to cook later."}
{"text":"This placed was recommended by a customer all the way from the north hills.  She raved about this place knowing that I lived fairly close to it. Went on a sat night.  Food was out of this world.  Pasta was delicious.  And service was exceptional!"}
{"text":"While I only rated this establishment a three-star, there is much good to say about the place. I thought that the wine pairing was interesting;a limited selection of well chosen wines. The wait staff was attentive and helpful. The food was four-star (the sauce on my pasta was a little overwhelming), Appetizers were tasty. The lemon cello at the end of the meal was nice. The bar area inside the door was fun (except that it also served as a waiting room for guest that just stood there looking awkward).

But too many negatives for the price. I have stated before, that (for me) the price is too high (it was crowded, so the management knows their price point). But one can get the same quality food and service at a dozen nearby places for much less. The place doesn't live up to the hype. The entrance and parking are dismal. It is very loud (a constant echoing din that makes it impossible to have a conversation). No oil for the bread, The salad comes with a dressing that isn't great, but there are no other choices. The menu is uninspired and not very informative. I'm not sure even now what the wine policy is. There was a $5.00 ($3.00 should be the maximum) corkage fee on the menu, so I am assuming hat you can bring your own bottle."}
{"text":"Unreal!! Long overdue in this area. The gnocchi are superb and light as a feather. The sauces are incredible and the imported meats and cheeses are varied and each one better than the last. Steve combines ingredients like no one else within a 50 mile radius can. By far the ONLY choice in the greater Pittsburgh area to eat if you are craving Italian. The wait staff are attentive but now smothering. Just an excellent experience and we will be back....ALOT. 

Still BYOB but for me that just adds to the ambience."}
{"text":"You would never expect this place to be located where it is, in an industrial park!  A bit difficult to find if you are not from the area, but well worth it!  Although it is a bit cramped, the ambiance reminds me of a trendy restaurant in the city, nothing that I expected here.  The four of us shared delicious meatballs and bruschetta, and the house olives and bread--and were literally stuffed.  We could have stopped there and left satisfied, however, we had our house salads and entrees coming.  I loved the house salad with the arugula and balsamic vinaigrette--others did not care for the dressing.  Next came our homemade pasta dishes that were a good size!  I had a spicy sauce with hot sausage, peppers and olive oil--loved it!  My daughter had a rigatoni dish that she loved.  In fact, everybody at the table was extremely pleased with their dishes.  I brought my leftovers home and was able to make two meals out of it (so did my daughter)!  We had complimentary lemoncello after dinner when the girls had their tiramisu--we were all extremely happy and full!  We will be back with empty bellies!"}
{"text":"Amazing five star food! Like nowhere else around here. Treat yourself. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Most unassuming place. You'd never know it was there, but wow! What a hidden treasure! Delicious food, great service, quaint environment. Perfect place for a wonderful meal. Try the short rib rage gnocchi!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Everything we had was delicious, very good classic & creative Italian dishes & unique appetizers. Meal finishes off with a complimentary lemoncello!  It is a little pricey, but worth every penny. Can't wait to go back. Keep your eyes open though, it is a little difficult to find from the main road."}
{"text":"I thought that this place was pretty good. I came with a large group with reservations on a Saturday night and the place was packed! I really liked what they had done with the design and layout of the place but I though that it could really use some sort of acoustic dampening as it was very loud and echoed quite a bit with all those people. Also on aside note there are a few religious references including in the name of this joint so if religious references irritate you that is a heads up. I'm cool with all religious stuff so whatever. The service was great and one of the highlights for me is no cork fees, whhhaaat??? That is a first for me . As  far as the food went I'm not sure if it was anything was all that special. Our table tried just about every appetizer and those were by far the stand out dishes, they were  nice portions and very flavorful. Now the main courses aren't for people avoiding carbs as the only options are the pasta dishes. I mean the place is in a pasta factory so what would you expect, right?? The pasta dish that I thought stood out among all the options was the rabbit dish it was very savory and recommend that to anybody who isn't adverse to chowing down on bugs bunny. all the other dishes were actually quite bland and was disappointed that there wasn't options as far as  ordering a dish with a different style of pasta. Overall pretty good but not sure if  I will make the trek all  the way back out here any time soon.

Also good luck finding this place even with a GPS, just keep in mind that it is in a factory type building."}
{"text":"Had 2 appetizers, dinner and tiramisu. Everything was homemade and amazing. This is one of the best restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. I highly recommend coming here hungry."}
{"text":"This place will blow you away... FRESH FRESH FRESH and great combinations of ingredients to make your taste buds come alive.  Dinner has some amazing dishes, but my favorite is their brunch.  Seriously, this place is top notch and worth your time and monet.  Call for a reservation because the word is out."}
{"text":"Wow! A tremendous meal, great staff, and a very romantic setting! This ones a keeper! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I would give it six stars if I could. 

This restaurant offers that special something that no other restaurant in the area does. In a region where Italian restaurants are aplenty, it takes a lot for one to stand out. Many of the Italian restaurants around Westmoreland county offer tasty traditional fare served in a slightly dated throwback setting. (Read, they were the \"fancy\" places 30 years ago, and while their food is still authentic and delicious, it doesn't have a sophisticated/modern appeal.) 

Enter Cenacolo. Another poster aptly described the atmosphere as \"industrial chic\". From the architecture to decor, lighting to music to table settings, and polished and knowledgable waitstaff, they've addressed every detail in creating the perfect setting for a memorable meal. 

So now on to the food, which is why everyone is dying to try this place. You won't find fettuccine Alfredo or lasagna or chicken Parmesan on this menu. What you will find is a lovely assortment of creative dishes, each description sounding lovelier than the last. Every meal offers a unique fresh-made pasta option, dressed up with exciting ingredients ranging from veal osso bucco to lobster and crab and short rib ragu. Good luck choosing...it took us forever! We chose the tagliolini (featuring an impressive amount of delicious crab), and the tortelloni, a wild boar filled pasta whose flavors were so bold yet complementary that we couldn't keep from \"mmmm\"-ing with every single bite. 

Dinner is served with fresh bread, complimentary olives, a well-executed arugula salad with a balsamic dressing, and even a complimentary after-dinner drink. (Ours was strawberry-cello, delicious!) 

Our server (Lauretta, I believe?) was fantastic. Warm and personable, a sophisticated knowledge of every single aspect of the menu, and the keen awareness of how to give the guests enough space to enjoy the romantic setting, and enough attention to feel pampered and without a single want or need. 

We will, quite obviously, be returning. Our meal, including two entrees, an appetizer and a carafe of sangria, was a bit of a splurge for us, but this will certainly become our go-to for special occasions and celebrations. This is one of those instances where the cost of the meal was worth it in every way, because you enjoy an experience that you simply cannot get elsewhere...and food you will be talking about for months."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Cenacolo 3-4 times and have loved it, but don't plan on returning after my last visit. 
My husband and I went here for Valentine's Day dinner. After waiting over an hour from when our orders were taken, our waitress admitted she forgot what we had ordered, which meant our orders had never been placed. We waited for another 30 minutes to receive our meals. We watched many couples come, eat, and go while we waited. 
When we received our food, it was clear that our pasta dishes had been tossed together; we ordered the same thing, but the dish sizes and portions were very different. I usually leave Cenacolo with 2 meals worth of leftovers, but was able to clean my plate this time. 
Our waitress offered complimentary dessert, which we really appreciated. We each ordered a slice of cheesecake to go (since we had now been there for 2 1/2 hours), but we only received 1 slice. At this point we were just ready to go and didn't care to ask for another slice."}
{"text":"Brunch is an unexpected joy. Pasta's live up to the hype. If there were a bit more variety or red sauce items on the menu, we would would eat there a twice a week."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to treat her Grandma to a nice lunch.  We found Cenacola on yelp and decided to try them for the first time.  The lunch was delicious, and the staff was exceedingly friendly.  Our 2-yr-old baby was with us, and we were worried the place may not accommodate kids.  The staff was inviting, and our baby had a great time. We all felt right at home.  

We ordered the meat-and-cheese plate appetizer, 3 pasta entrees, and the tiramisu for dessert.  The food was excellent.  The pasta is homemade; it tasted fresh and was cooked perfectly.  All 3 pasta entrees tasted unique.

We came for lunch on a weekday.  The place was moderately busy, but not packed, and we were seated immediately.  We sat in the market area, which was nice and open.  Since it wasn't crowded, our baby could walk about and watch the pasta makers.  The place is small, so it might get crowded at dinner time.

The food is top quality, and I feel it is worth the price.  This place is more expensive than an average family restaurant, but you are getting fresh made pasta, and it's a good value for the high quality of food.  The staff was very friendly and warm.  We definitely recommend Cenacola to anyone looking for a delicious Italian meal."}
{"text":"This is quite literally the best, most authentic Italian food I've ever had. And it's in a business complex next to my kids' dentist! Handmade pasta to die for. Try the fresh mozzarella for an appetizer!"}
{"text":"Industrial chic. Tough to find this little gem, but oh so worth it. Please make a reservation! Nice choice of wine,  but you can bring your own and pay a corkage fee. Meatball appetizer excellent.  Bread warm with honey butter. Salad a nice mix of sweet and tangy. The pumpkin ravioli is unique and delisious.  Toasted hazelnuts top a creamy sauce that covers a savory - with a hint of sweet - pumpkin pasta.  The delicate spices linger on the edges of you tongue. Yum! The portions are generous.  Wish it wasn't so pricey. But it is excellent quality. My tongue was happy."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. It's in a strange location but don't let that deter you. We had the burrino for an appetizer and it is incredible. Fresh mozzarella and bread toasted with butter. They also gave us complimentary olives and salads. Both of our pasta dishes were large servings and really delicious. We also had dessert - tiramisu and the brûléed cheesecake. Service was excellent, thanks Stephanie! Recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"Not much to add to the many praises Yelpers have written. The seating felt cramped for the prices they charge but the freshness and flavor of my food helped me forget about all that.  The service was pleasant as expected but nothing spectacular.  It's a special place in an unusual venue.  It has a hip, trendy feel and the food is memorable.

The Trottola I ordered was delicious but the portion was too large. I was traveling so taking out leftovers was not an option. Enjoyable experience and a place I would return to again - if I can find it! Guaranteed that first timers like me will have difficulty finding the place.  Perhaps that adds to the allure of Cenacolo."}
{"text":"Really difficult to find- we drove around the business park for 20 minutes and had to call for detailed instructions. Once we found it the experience was worth the issues getting there.

The cheese plate and appetizers were terrific. The salad greens had a nice bite. My pasta dish was topped witg crab and they were more generous with the amount of crab than any restaurant I've ever been to. The pastry dessert was delicious. We had more than enough to take home for two meals. 

Everything was served extremely quickly. The staff was friendly and helpful with suggestions.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Have visited twice. Overall the food is decent, but for the price, not good enough. Both times it seems like they are just off on some detail with our dishes (whole garlic pieces in sauce, should have been chopped. Sun-dried tomatoes overwhelming the rest of the dish). Both times the pasta was wayyyyyy over sauced. The flavors are there, and the pasta is good, but I have never been completely satisfied. Del Forno(their pizza place next door) is s much better option in my opinion."}
{"text":"The family and I were there again yesterday for the brunch. As always, the staff is very professional and attentive. The Short Ribs and Hash is out of this world and I would highly recommend. It's really nice to have a restaurant of this quality in the Irwin area!  We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Always look forward to every visit! Gluten free options as well. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Irwin. Tonight I visited with one of my girlfriends for dessert after we did dinner next door at Dal Forno. The perfect combination! Don't let the location scare you. It's in the back of a business complex. They have a private parking lot that may be full, however you can find plenty of parking out front just a few steps away. 

We walked in around 8:30 and right away grabbed two seats at the bar. The place was still crowded with huge bowls of pasta flying around from table to table. The dessert menu has a great selection of food and drinks. The bartender was super friendly and accommodating as I told her my allergies. We ended up ordering two things - the Burleed  Cheesecake and the Tiramisu - NO REGRETS! I never experienced anything so good. I cannot wait to come back and try the pastas. Everything is made. You can also order take out and other individual items like pastas and sauces to take home."}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing place. When I come to Pittsburgh, I eat as much italian food as possible since we're still a little lacking on great italian options in Austin. My brother insisted we hit Cenacolo's (instead of Gia Visto in Monroeville). Good call, bro!

The space is beautiful. I love the aesthetic of old warehouses and this is just amazing. My phone service is crap in this area and it was difficult to find but with a little effort possible. Beautiful lighting, exposed brick, glass block facing west. The vibe is casual yet upscale, very Pittsburgh in a contemporary industrial way. Entrees are pricey but entirely worth it. Service was fantastic. We got the meatball appetizer, the rigatoni with hot sausage and the spinach and asiago ravioli with cream sauce. Everything was amazing...its hard to choose a standout but I think the meatballs were the best I've ever eaten. The ravioli VERY rich and delicious. And even though the rigatoni serving was huge we all fought over the leftovers the next day at home. 

It is a little pricey, so If you're wanting to try Cenacolo's but are on a budget, fear not for Cenacolo's also offers their fresh pasta and sauces to go for about half what you pay in house. In fact, I left my phone there and had to go back the next day so I took some rigatoni and marinara to fly back to Texas with me. When I was walking across the parking lot I dropped my entire bag of food and the marinara container broke. They were so sweet and replaced the entire order free of charge! How sweet. A+ service.  

Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time going here. We went day before v- day on Saturday. They were very busy but that didn't affect the service or the the food. Everything we got was amazing."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday, his aunt had been here a week before and said we absolutely had to try it.  The service was friendly and quick, even though our server seemed very busy that night.  It's definitely a tight space, and some of the guests were being really loud, but luckily they left only a few minutes after we sat down.

We ordered an appetizer that was essentially bread with fresh mozzarella baked/broiled on top, recommended by our server.  I don't know how to describe it other than absolutely amazing.  I had the seasonal pumpkin ravioli and my husband had the lobster ravioli.  Both were delicious!  I've had lobster ravioli before, but this was definitely the best I've had.  I was impressed that everything, including the salad and the bread, tasted so good.  This restaurant is a little on the expensive side, but well worth it."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been wanting to try this out of the restaurant next to the Irwin Post Office ever since people began recommending it 
  Tonight was our 32nd anniversary and what a nice place to spend it   This BYOB place attached to the Fede pasta retail store and wholesaler was a truly wonderful experience   It is a pasta restaurant that specializes in pasta and antipasta consisting of artisan meats and cheeses. Portions were large and quite tasty. The desert choices were adequate and we settled on a simple gelato because we were stuffed after eating only half our meals   Ordering coffee with dessert turned out to be a welcome surprise which turned out to be a container of a French pressed liquid.  The service was great and the atmosphere was intimate in the one room. The other area tables lined the perimeter of the retail space   We went on a Tuesday and it wasn't crowded, however reservations are a good idea and weekends should be avoided."}
{"text":"Excellent food. A little pricey but you get an awesome meal. This would be for very special occasions! I love the olives that they send out first."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, and the setting is very cozy. I will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in North Huntington. The atmosphere, the food and the staff are always awesome."}
{"text":"Giving this place 4 stars. 

Food. Outstanding. I had the rabbit with square pasta. It was amazing. We had an appetizer of fried artichoke hearts and also a 5 choice of meats/cheeses. Both were great.  Tasted the crab pasta and lobster/corn ravioli...yum. Great portion sizes according to price. Salad was fresh arugula with slices of parm and the dressing was a sweet basalmic. Leftovers to bring home on the pasta. Dessert of tiramisu.  Not the best tiramisu I've ever had, but it was very good. 

Atmosphere. It's a little loud because everything is polished concrete. I think maybe if the added wall hangings that absorbed some of the noise, it would be more pleasant. 
Service. Our waitress was excellent and went through the menu offering suggestions and descriptions. 
BYOB. Awesome. No corking fee either. 

Table seating...this is where I would give it a 1 or a zero. They sat 5 of us in the lobby area...right in the middle of where everyone was standing to wait and worse RIGHT next to the bathrooms. Terrible. The bathroom doors didn't remain closed and we could smell the toilet drop ins. We had made a reservation two weeks before and asked if there was a different table stating we did have a reservation. Front of the house girl was pretty short and said basically this was it and deal with it. You are front of the house...pleasant attitude is expected and they obviously knew it was a screw up because they comped both appetizers. There was also no salt/pepper on table so I'm thinking this was not a regular seating place. 

Will I return? Most likely yes. However, if I have to sit in the bathroom again I will not go back. Suggestion...put a couple bar tables there so waiting guests can have a drink/appetizer while standing."}
{"text":"Fede aka Cenecola.  After a lot of searching around, my friends picked and reserved this place for our NYE dinner ...this was the first time in 4 years that this particular group of friends would be able to be together to celebrate NYE, and probably won't happen again for at least another 4 years do to the fact of some living out of state.  Anyways upon making the reservations back on Dec 1, 2014...she was given the explanation on BYOB and BYOW that the place offers. (it was 1.00 corking fee per beer and 5.00 per wine bottle). Little did we know that all because of a 6 pack of beer we would be asked to leave.  We showed up at 7pm for our reservation time....were told the table was finishing up and it'll be a few minutes.  No problem, we expected it.  So we stood....for 30 minutes waiting and waiting. Our waitress to be offered to open up our bottle of wine to at least have that while we waited so we did that and 2 guys in our group who don't drink wine brought their 6 pack and each opened one.  The owner Steve approached them and said that BYOB is no longer allowed. (Not sure what he wanted them to do with the beer that they just opened)  The person who made our reservation asked when this change happened because reservations were made on Dec 1 and it was still as of then at least on the website still stating that BYOB was allowed. Steve told us it changed a few weeks ago.  This would've been nice to know whenever the confirmation call came in to confirm the reservation. Politely state that changes were made about BYOB. But instead nothing was said and the guys were told that basically they should dump their beers.  We inquired to Steve about our reservation time and asked when our table would be ready for us  which at this point was now 40 minutes past our time and Steve without hesitation showed us the door said we can leave.  What business owner does this??! You have a party of 12 on NYE wanting to dine at your place and you are showing us the DOOR instead of trying to get us seated!  It definitely was apparent we were judged by him as being a \"young\" crowd based on the fellow diners that were there.  When in reality compared to the other diners a mid 30 group is \"younger\" but we weren't a group of teenagers that's for sure.  He did tell us we could go over and ask the group to leave that was in our table...again not sure what business owner does that!  After we were told to do that we left our glasses of wine and took our business elsewhere as he gladly waved us goodbye.  I hope that loosing our group of 12 that night and having your waitress loose what money she would've earned from us was worth it over a 6 pack of beer.  Very unprofessional. Very disappointed and we have shared and will continue to share this experience with all we know.  We left at 745, arrived at Lucci's in Harrison City and told them our situation and they gladly accepted us even though they were closing at 830...they served us willingly, felt bad for us and we closed the restaurant at 9pm and all of our couples gave our waitress at min 40percent tip since they did us a favor and this place saved us the $$ we would have spent at Cenecola's.. We were HAPPY to hand over a HUGE tip to a deserving working and company."}
{"text":"By far the best in Western PA! Great imported Italian cheese and meats. Steve is outstanding at pasta making. The gnocchi are light as a feather and remind me of my grandmother's. Everything is so good."}
{"text":"What a gem! We went with friends who had been there before. So glad they did. From the moment we came in... What a find! The restaurant was a buzz with customers and wonderful smells. Two rooms available, the bar and a small dining room. We head mussels and a cheese bread for appetizers. Terrific combination. Their wine list was small, but reasonable and varied. We settled on a pino grigio that was just fabulous. We could not decide on dinner options. All looked so good. I got the short ribs gnocchi. We also got the spinach ravioli and tagletelle and another pasta dish with veggies and truffle oil. It was all delicious. We could have settled on to meals as the pertinent were huge. But, now we have left overs for a few days. 
They bring lemoncello and cookies to top off the evening. 
The restaurant is in the middle of an industrial type park. But, don't let that fool you. Step inside... You will be thrilled you did."}
{"text":"Went last night for the first time an anniversary dinner with our best friends. WOW!  Hands down the best polenta I've ever tasted.  Our table for 5 shared 4 appetizers and 5 different pastas - each entree was memorable. And then there were the deserts!  All served in a delightful atmosphere by a great waitress, Casey.  This was well worth the drive on a miserable, cold, rainy night.  We will go back - OFTEN!"}
{"text":"The best food experience I have had in years. No complaints. Everything was top notch."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been dying to try this place for about 4 months, since we were referred by a co-worker of mine. I am so glad we were suggested to go here because if not, we would have never found this place seated in the back of an industrial park. We finally made a reservation for Saturday night, and it blew. our. minds. 

If you've never tasted homemade pasta before, prepare yourselves for an experience.

Our waitress was excellent. She was thorough and personable (I think her name was Robin?), and she answered all our questions, while making suggestions when we needed a little extra help deciding. We brought a nice bottle of red wine to start with (it's BYOB but they also have their liquor license so you can purchase from them, too). The first thing our waitress brought us was a complimentary bowl of olives, which seemed to be seasoned with oil and some spices. I noticed they lacked a vinegary taste and seemed to be flavored with mostly oil and herbs, which I really enjoyed. She also brought bread and this amazingly sweet butter -spread that just melted in your mouth.  Our entrees came with arugula salads, consisting of tomato, shaved parm, and this nice balsamic dressing. It was the PERFECT balance of peppery from the arugula, to the sweet tomato, and lastly the creamy balsamic was a great topper that married everything together perfectly.

Fresh mozz and meatballs were our appetizers. The fresh mozz balls were out of this world amazing and pulled to order. They were fresher than even the mozzarella I had while in Venice. This right here was a game changer right off the bat. The cheese also came with a pesto and roasted red pepper crostini, which paired perfectly with the cheese, in my opinion. The meatballs, made with prosciutto and mortadella, were loaded with garlic and were incredibly soft. There was shaved cheese on top and some chopped green onion, which was the perfect touch.

For dinner, I had the Tagliolini dish, which had crabmeat, chives, lemon, and parmesan cheese, only instead of the tagliolini pasta, I subbed the Pappardelle. Let me just emphasize how much crab was in this dish....there was so much crab, that when I finished my NOODLES, I was very close to asking for a doggy bag for the leftover crab ALONE (then I swallowed my pride and just ate it). I am also a little obsessed with garlic and the endless slivers of garlic in this dish made me extremely happy. 

My husband ordered the Tagliatelle, which contained shrimp, scallops, calamari, mussels, and spicy marinara sauce, only he substituted the marinara for a crème de parma sauce. The seafood was cooked perfectly and the pasta was perfectly al dente. He thought the flavors were extremely balanced and he thoroughly enjoyed this dish.

We shared crème brulee for dessert that was topped with the softest most flavorful strawberries-- an amazing touch.  The custard on the inside had a slight caramel-y flavor, I thought, which was extremely smooth and creamy. We both agreed it was by far the best crème brulee we have ever tasted. Following, our waitress brought us amaretto and a strawberrie'd lemoncello to cleanse our pallets, which we somehow made room for, even though by this time, we were already nearly one pants button undone. Everyone working here seemed to work together, cleaning tables as they walked by, delivering food, and refilling our waters, which seemed to make everything run more smoothly. Can't wait for visit #2!"}
{"text":"I'm loving this Italian eatery.  Very trendy atmosphere mixed with authentic homemade cuisine. Enjoyed a fine dinner with very large portions. Reminds me of my trip to Rome... it's that good! Just make sure to call early enough to get a reservation!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant.  Upon arrival we entered the restaurant, with a reservation,  and wasn't greeted for almost 10 minutes. Many servers walked by and understandably were busy for a Saturday night. I know a busy server is unable to stop and there was no hostess present , so I was hoping for maybe at least an acknowledgement of some kind. Even just to say hello and someone would be with you when they can. Eventually a hostess came by and asked us how many in our party , to which we responded that we had already made a reservation for 6. We were seated shortly after that and our waiter was absolutely wonderful. I loved his knowledge of the menu and he was able to make suggestions offer recommendations.  Sadly we were seated next to the employee smoking exit and everytime someone went through we got a nice whiff of smoke. I was a little disappointed with the limited meat choices . Mostly seafood in all of the pastas and I knew bringing my mother to this restaurant is out because she is allergic to most seafood. I need to use the restroom and boy was it a mess. The small waste basket was overflowing onto the floor and toilet paper was on the floor around the toilet. The food was good and I was satisfied by my meal however the experience overall was a bit lack luster. The server was by far was my pro for this restaurant  and there certainly is potential if just these simple things are adressed."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite restaurant! Everything is fresh and cooked to order! All pastas are homemade.  Make reservations and dinner is served at a casual pace so do not be in a hurry when you go there. Atmosphere is wonderful!  Bring extra money to purchase homemade pasta!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining here again on New Year's Eve and last weekend. Both times the food and service were fantastic! I love introducing friends to Cenacolo. I'll be back soon..."}
{"text":"This place needs no tips! Absolutely fantasic and delicious meal."}
{"text":"The pasta is amazing and the servings are very filling!. Definately try the Parmesan Truffle popcorn appetizer! Its so tasty! The meal came with an olive sampler and bread with honey butter. After the meal you get a little cookie and a shot limoncello"}
{"text":"Wow! That is all I can say about this place. What an unbelievable eating experience. Located in North Huntingdon Township, this restaurant exceeded all expectations. My wife and I came for our anniversary dinner and we left more than pleased.

For the appetizer we ordered Burrino, which is fresh mozzarella bread with butter inside of it. It was unbelievable! My wife got the spinach and asiago ravioli. I got the Bucatini. Both were excellent. My wife got sangria to drink and I got a dogfish head 60 minute IPA. Dinners come with salad and bread which has an amazing sweet butter to spread on it. With all that said the bill came to $75. 

The service was impeccable. The waitress was very knowledgeable about every single dish and every single thing on the drink menu.  I don't think that is all that bad considering the quality of food. We will be back for sure. We can't wait! Check out the pictures."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  Some of the best Italian I've ever had.  The menu is extremely diverse, and each dish is very well thought out, and has been perfectly executed each time we've visited."}
{"text":"Wow!  There is nothing else like this place in Westmoreland County.  This is not the same as every other restaurant around but truly different and delicious.  This restaurant could easily hold it's own in Shadyside or Squirrel Hill but instead it is in Irwin, Wow!

All pasta is made on site along with sauces, and much more, cheeses and meats are imported.

Dinners come with a basic salad that is not your standard iceberg fair.  The dessing is homemade and wonderful and arugula, cheese, and ripe tomatoes are used.  Before dinner we were given imported olives and after dinner a small cookie and a bit of limoncello.  I will come back here every time I am back in town."}
{"text":"Flew in from Colorado and went here with a friend for dinner.  Surprisingly full for a Tuesday.  Very enjoyable dinner!  The crab bruschetta was unusual and delicious.  The salad was fresh and tasty and the linguine with the langoustinos had a thicker sauce than what I have seen elsewhere, but it was great.  Wish I could have finished it all and had room for dessert, because based on the rest of the meal I'm sure it would have been great.  Unusual location so if you're not familiar with the area worth the effort to find it."}
{"text":"As close to anything you would eat in Italy! Intimate atmosphere, excellent service, and the meals are incredible! This is not an average Italian restaurant. It's special and unforgettable every time. The lobster ravioli is a personal favorite, but every dish is simply amazing.

Again, it's a small restaurant, space is at a premium. They do everything they can to accommodate you and your guests. I've seen some awful reviews from people who, by their own admission, acted like animals, then were offended when they were treated as such. All I can say is maybe a high class establishment is beyond their comprehension, and perhaps Pizza Hut is a better fit for them. Let those with discriminating taste enjoy places like Cenacolo in peace."}
{"text":"Great food, albeit a bit pricey. Be forewarned BYOB policy has changed! You are allowed to open ONE bottle only, and we were not told about this when our first bottle was opened !"}
{"text":"So I walk in and hear a click clack...they were making pasta and one of the workers was rolling something divine. I was ready to eat. The warm bread and honey butter was succulent. The Ricotta Gnocchi was amazing. The presentation was great and the flavor was awwwwww. Stealing a menu, taking the chef home and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Extremely loud, echoing off the walls restaurant. It leaves your ears numb.

Bitter greens and grease soaked bread.

Im out 

Wasted toll fare to get here, what a waste"}
{"text":"If you can find it...it's definitely worth the trip.  I stopped in for lunch and after driving by the place twice, I found my way.  The inside is really warm and cozy - not what you would expect from a place that is in a warehouse in the middle of nowhere.  

I had the bruschetta to start - fresh bread with a basil pesto, roasted red peppers, and freshly pulled mozzarella.  There were three decent sized pieces and I should really have stopped there because they were really filling.  I definitely recommend sharing.    This was followed by a salad, which consisted of arugula, tomatoes, parmesan, and a balsamic vinaigrette.  This is the dish I could take or leave, but that's mostly because I don't love arugula.  The tomatoes, dressing, and parmesan were all superior though.  

I followed that up with a seasonal butternut squash gnocchi.  This dish had a hazelnut mascarpone sauce and some sausage.  I initially thought it was on the heavy side with the sauce, but that might have been because I was sort of full from the appetizer.  The portion was plentiful and I barely made a dent.  I took it home and had it for dinner and there were still some leftovers.  The sauce separated a bit upon reheating (as any cream sauce will), but I simply mopped out the extra oil and found the leftovers even more delightful than the fresh dish. The gnocchi were just right and I would absolutely order it again.   

They also added a few nice extra touches.   They brought a little dish of marinated olives to start with.  I hate olives and didn't try them, but I appreciated the gesture all the same.  At the end of the meal, there was a complimentary shot of lemoncello and a little cookie.  Just enough to top off a fabulous meal.   

4 stars instead of 5 because I think if you are going to serve lunch, you should have a lunch menu.  Lunch portions and lunch prices would have made the experience perfect.   For dinner though, it's a winner.  Not cheap, but worth the price and you can BYOB."}
{"text":"Really cool venue located in a pasta factory. The food was outstanding. We got 2 appetizers and 4 different entrees. Due to their size we shared a lot. Everything we tried was outstanding. Fresh ingredients, handmade pasta and real proteins like actual crab meat make this place a guaranteed great meal. They have a great beer list (bottles) and the service was fantastic. The server really knew about all the dishes and how they were prepared. Outstanding experience overall."}
{"text":"We were introduced to Cenacolo by our Pittsburgh-based son, and always try to dine there  during our twice-a-year visits to Pittsburgh. In the words of a Michelin 3-star rating, it's worth the journey. The food, especially the pasta, is the closest I've experienced to dining in Italy itself. The main course portions are huge, so when in a group we have learned to order a variety of appetizers and then split the main course. I am surprised by the negative comments directed toward Steve, as I have always found him to be a wonderful host and his serving staff are friendly, efficient, and always willing to explain the menu. It is indeed something of an unusual \"factory\" decor because the business is based upon supplying pasta to Pittsburgh's upscale restaurants, but I find that charming and unpretentious. Give me great food and I am a happy camper. It's also hard to find, so have a good GPS or someone familiar with the neighborhood, especially after dark.  If you see the postal trucks, you are close.  Just proceed to the factory-like structure beyond the post office."}
{"text":"In my opinion, by far the best restaurant in this area. The food is delicious! The location seems odd, but this restaurant is absolutely worth finding!"}
{"text":"I've heard a good bit about this restaurant and we've tried several times to go but it's challenging to get in because they are always booked...well try no more, the day finally came.

It's not your typical Italian place, if you're looking for spaghetti and meatballs, pizza, a hoagie, or chicken parm...this is not the place to go....

The menu is limited and you can to expect to pay approximately $27 per plate for a pasta dish with peppers and sausage or meatballs...now it does come with a small
salad containing 2 tomatoes, cheese, and balsamic along with bread and sweet warm butter. 

I enjoyed the pasta with banana peppers and meatballs, however I would not recommend the cheese ravioli with meat sauce.

When it comes to feedback, our server boxed our to go food. After a long wait gave us the bill to which we immediately laid down our card...she eventually picked it up, then laid my card face up at the bar in direct view of other patrons for nearly 10 minutes while she waited on other customers opening me up to fraud. I hope they consider tightening their policy on the way they handle their patrons forms of payment."}
{"text":"Food was excellent but we won't be back.

Unique and interesting restaurant.  Atmosphere was industrial chic with lots to look at while waiting for our table.  Reservations are a must.  We started with the Hot Sopresseta and Asiago cheese, which was hot and very tasty. Next came the salad, which had possibly the best salad dressing I have ever tasted.  The rolls came with honey butter which was excellent in spite of the fact that I don't care for honey.  For the main course,  I had Pasta Alla Chitarra which was tasty and cooked to perfection.  The guys each had spaghetti with shrimp and they left not a morsel on their plates.  My friend had Tagliolini with crabmeat and said it was awesome.  We loved the BYOB policy with no cork fee.  We finished 3 bottles of wine and at the end of the meal our waiter brought us a shot of lemoncello, whch was delicious.

Our reservation was for 7:30 and we were seated about 7:50, which was not a problem at all.   At 9:25, Chef Steve asked that we leave in order to seat other later reservations.  I don't know if the party of 8, who came in at the same time as we did, or another party of 4 in another room, who also got there when we did, were also asked to leave, but for this reason, I am giving this place 3 stars instead of 5.  It was a very surprising and  disappointing ending to an otherwise wonderful evening."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the best in the area!  Great homemade pastas!  Love their raviolis!  The best thing on their menu is the burring- it's so buttery and cheesy - after the last bite you'll want to order another one!  Great family owned and run business!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD!
Really there isn't much that you can say bad about this place besides that it is a little hard to find.   It's pricey, but you get what you pay for and then some! And you can just go for appetizers and dessert, and leave totally satisfied. 
Staff is great, food is exceptional!  Reservations are helpful especially on a Saturday night!"}
{"text":"Located within the Fede pasta factory, Cenacolo serves some of the freshest pasta I've ever tasted.  The pasta dishes I tried here are easily as good as those I've had at the best Italian restaurants I've visited to date, both in Pittsburgh and elsewhere.  There really is nowhere else like Cenacolo anywhere--so if you're a fan of pasta, it's well worth the trip.

Having said that, anyone who knows me well knows that I never go far out of my way to visit restaurants (even exceptional ones!); I always wait until I'm headed in a certain direction to justify the trip.  Such an opportunity presented itself this Sat., when CM and I headed into the Laurel Highlands to visit some wineries.  Knowing that Cenacolo was still BYOB (albeit with a $5 corking fee), and that wine and pasta naturally complement one another, we made a side excursion to Cenacolo for dinner on our way back to PGH, where we both live.

It's difficult to describe the space, other than to say that the ambiance is more casual than your typical upscale Italian restaurant due to the pasta factory/market setting.  The tables are quite spread out, and the walls are exposed brick, which does amplify acoustics, as others have mentioned, esp. given that there is no background music.  At the time of our visit, however, about 2/3-3/4 of the tables were occupied, so I didn't find the acoustics totally overwhelming.  The two top table at which we were seated was a high top, and the chairs weren't the most comfortable, but it didn't really bother us, per se.  Service from our waitress, a middle aged woman, was impeccable, despite our being the youngest patrons at the time that we dined, and only ordering entrees and no alcohol.

Because we had spent the entire afternoon munching on snacks to negate the effects of the wine that we'd consumed, we decided to forego appetizers, despite my curiosity about the fresh mozzarella.  (That, of course, gives me an excellent excuse to return--along with buying pasta for my own use.)  For my entree, I ordered the bruco ($20), which consisted of wavy pasta with wild mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, mascarpone cream, and truffle.  It was obvious that the pasta, which was cooked perfectly al dente, was fresh, and the flavors of the other ingredients married together with depth and complexity.  CM ordered the four cheese ravioli with meat sauce ($20), which I also sampled, despite my aversion to beef.  Despite the seeming simplicity of this dish, again, the pasta was perfectly cooked, the filling was deliciously light and savory, and the red sauce was complex and mouthwateringly delicious in flavor.  Before our entrees were served, we were provided with freshly baked bread and honey butter, as well as a salad with arugula, shaved parmesan, and cherry tomatoes dressed with a delicious sweet balsamic dressing that even CM, who isn't partial to sweet-savory mixtures, greatly enjoyed.  At the end of our meal, we were provided with shots of limoncello and almond cookies with the check, which we thought was an especially nice touch.

Needless to say, this was one of the most memorable meals that CM and I enjoyed together. Sadly, it also turned out to be our last, as our relationship has since come to a close.  Thank you, Cenacolo, for providing such a delicious and enjoyable last supper for us, and a wonderful final memory of our time together."}
{"text":"Warning: If you follow a low carb lifestyle, this is not the place for you!

Now, my review:

We went with a group of 13 and of course had reservations and had asked for separate checks when making the reservations. The menu states that there is a maximum of two separate checks per large group. We were all happy that this had been arranged beforehand.

Appetizers: We shared three appetizers and I'm sorry but I can't remember the names but they were the artichokes, sausage and peppers and beans and greens. All were fabulous!!

Our server suggested ordering family style for such a large group but much like herding cats, we couldn't get that worked out.

The servings are very generous so I think family style would have been better!

I ordered the Popette (meatballs) from the appetizer section and my husband ordered the pasta with scallops and roasted peppers and we shared. It was more than enough for us!! 

The restaurant is extremely noisy so it's difficult with a large group.

We do follow a low carb lifestyle so this was a huge splurge for us! It was delicious but not something we would do often. I would have liked at least one or two non-pasta choices but it's a pasta restaurant!!! 

We had a great time with great friends."}
{"text":"This is an Italian restaurant like no other in Western PA.

Unique would be an understatement. 

The specifics that follow should make you run to your phone for a reservation...
and since Cenacolo seats about 40, you will need a reservation. 

Cenacolo serves the best pasta you have ever eaten... made from scratch in a kitchen 15 feet away from the table you are sitting at. No veal. No chicken. No fish. 
No sauce from a restaurant supplier's 5 gallon bucket. This is about incredible, fresh artisan pasta. Fede pasta, made by Steve's passionate staff of experts.

Why is that so?

Steve Salvi, the owner, has worked in some of Pittsburgh's top restaurants. Disappointed by the lack of quality in restaurant purveyors' pasta offerings, Steve started to make his own pasta. In 2005 he created Fede Pasta, and now supplies many local and national  restaurants around the country.

Never one to walk away from cooking, Steve offered lunches three days a week at the Fede Pasta dining room. Incredible response from his patrons caused Steve to open the small, special restaurant for lunch, dinner and retail purchase of his hand-made pasta.

The menu features Affettato... thinly shaved, cured Italian meats, and Formaggi... delicious cheeses among the appetizers. Oh, you were expecting a few thin, small pieces of meat or cheese on a plank for an outrageous amount of money. Not here!
A satisfying amount for a fair price, and artistically presented. Where do these fresh goodies come from? The retail service area just a few steps from the restaurant. (Oh, yeah... Italy fits in this supply chain too.)

More appetizers: my wife and I split three delicious meatballs served with a bit of sauce and some chunky Parmesan presented on a rustic slab of wood. Wow! Good!

Not listed on the menu, but really good: arugula salad, cherry tomatoes, shaved Parmesan cheese and balsamic vinegar. One of the best salads I have ever tasted.
Sure, it is included. You're family, right?

Lineamente: seasonal pasta offered at the appropriate times of the year. 

Traditional pasta served throughout the year. Classics, some with shrimp, some with salmon, some with jumbo lump crabmeat and some with short rib ragu. Yes, there are meat and seafood options, BUT the feature is always the pasta. And what pasta it is. In his years of designing pasta for great restaurants, Steve always works with the best chefs to come up with pasta that looks fabulous... and tastes even better.

Sooooooo, what would be good to drink with this incredible pasta? Anything YOU want. Bring your own wine; there is no corkage fee. This is an Italian family restaurant. You are welcome to have your favorite wine; think about how much money you just saved! Artisan Pasta is the star at Cenacolo Restaurant, not inflated wine prices.

Dessert? You think ordinary? Think again. A couple of traditional classics. Go for different. When I described our dining experience to my coworkers today, they told me they would visit just for the dessert alone... that good!

SUMMARY:

If you are here, you have read a long review. Cenacolo is a very small restaurant showcasing the talents of Steve Salvi and an incredible staff in the kitchen, in the retail product service area and servers who know the food well and really hustle to take care of their guests. 

It is a family undertaking. A special sharing of Steve's love for Italian food presented as artistically and delicious as you will find anywhere. This is not some slick, corporate, mass-production restaurant. Steve's family works in the Fede kitchen. I have been in the kitchen. There is a passion for perfection. Nice family that gives back to the community in many ways. You have to know Steve. He truly cares about people at all levels of their being. This is about helping and sharing.

I have never met a man who cares as much as Steve does... whatever the undertaking. Visit his restaurant. Say \"Hi\" to him. Enjoy the experience. You will long remember it. Cenacolo truly is different. 

IMPORTANT NOTES:

The location is in BANCO BUSINESS PARK, not the middle of Irwin. I would suggest that you drive out there during the day to find out exactly where it is. Signs indicate Fede Pasta. This is in a large building in an industrial park. You are not looking for a mall location or something you might find in South Side or on Butler Street. Fede Pasta is a manufacturing facility. Cenacolo Restaurant exists within that operation.

YOU SHOULD MAKE A RESERVATION. REALLY! 
(Remember, this restaurant seats about 40 people. Scheduling is tricky.)"}
{"text":"Outstanding food.  Although it's hidden,  nice ambiance inside although a bit loud.  Byo. Pasta Brucco is my fave.  I've been here several times & had a wonderful experience each time."}
{"text":"I enjoyed lunch here yesterday.  The food was delicious and plentiful. The three of us ordered and shared tastes of Four Cheese Ravioli, Giglio, and Linguine. I wouldn't hesitate to order any of these again. We loved each of these. For dessert we had Tiramisu and Carrot Cannoli.  Both were creamy, light and very, very tasty.

Our server was very friendly and accommodating (somewhat of a rarity in N. Huntingdon).
 
Overall a wonderful and seriously enjoyable experience.

Thank you so much Cencacolo"}
{"text":"1st off I must say I didn't try the food... why?... We stopped on Valentines Day, we did not have a reservation, the staff was very nice an asked us to wait a bit since it was snowing they thought there were some cancelations, there were and she proceed to seat us... the place was pretty empty yet we were seated at a small 2 person table less then a foot from another 2 person table and the entire place was set up like that. It was terrible. Not to mention not one entrée  was less than $20 bucks. If I am going to spend $20 - 30 bucks a plate I darn well better be comfortable. It was also a very small menu, and the location seems very strange.   We ended just leaving."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for a party of 12 for new year's eve.  Rules were strict- no separate checks, 2 hour limit, cork fees on wine and beer if byob.  Waited for over 40 minutes for table eventhough we had a reservation and there was a 2 hour limit. Manager Steve harrassed us for drinking beer while waiting for our table.  We showed him the flyer that said byob beer is ok.  He said that they changed the rules and that we didnt have to stay and accused us of being rude.  It seemed like he wanted us to leave.  He was extremely rude.  The rest of the staff was very nice but this guy was a real jerk.  Worst restaurant experience ever.  All 12 of us walked out and went to Lucci's which was awesome.  As we walked out the manager sarcastically said bye bye and waved.  Huge jerk.  We will never go back.  We will tell everyone we know to never go there."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Cenecolo MANY, MANY times, and we've never been disappointed. We feel every course has a lot to offer the foodie! Although we've thoroughly enjoyed many of their apps, we love the Fiore di Latte (dynamite). I could just sit and eat their pesto out of a bowl in the kitchen...lol. Over time, we've literally tried every appetizer & never a disappointment. The warm bread w/the honey butter (need I say more!), the pasta portions are always enough for a two meals (count on taking some home to lick your lips on the next day), and if all that isn't enough, EVERY dessert is delicious AND they have a great decaf cappuccino(Mark gets the reg cap-sometimes not hot enough for him)...to boot, it can be a BYOB, but they have a very nice selection of wines."}
{"text":"I visited Cenacolo again. It has been a while since I was there. I was happily impressed by the food the service and now they offer wine but you can also bring your own bottle. 
The have added many tables and they seem to be a happening place. Kudos to them! 
I would like them to have a little back ground music, to me this always helps when you have tables so close to each other.  They have set some lower ceiling to the area with higher ceilings,  which was loud before. This has improved much the noise. Last time I was not able to hear well our own conversation. 
Overall I would recommend the place for their food originality and good service."}
{"text":"I was there on Wednesday evening and what a wonderful experience I had... The service was good but the food was great..  Perfectly seasoned brocolini also the marmalade with the mozzarella is a perfect  pairing.. Crab pasta n gnocchi were both very hot n flavorful.. Great job...  Oh yea LEMON  CELLO a great finish."}
{"text":"This is truly a hidden gem in Irwin! They are located in the oddest location, in banco industrial park. From the outside it looks like nothing, but when you go in it's beautiful. The atmosphere is gorgeous, the servers are polite, and the chefs are amazing. They make their own noodles in house, and have great specials. They have an extensive wine list, and the prices of wine and food is reasonable for the delicious quality. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent pasta.  I'm partial to the Bruco.  The bruco pasta entree comes with mascarpone sauce, truffle oil, wild mushrooms.  Great!  The arugula salad is also quite tasty, however get the the sweet balsamic on the side, as they tend to put too much on it.  

Also, the fresh mozzarella is absolutely delicious!  This is probably the best Italian Restaurant in the Pittsburgh area now."}
{"text":"Love going here. It's affordable with a great atmosphere and fantastic food! Would go everyday if I could!"}
{"text":"Four of us went to Cenacolo this past weekend and I have to say that I have been hesitant on writing a review because I don't want this place to become so popular that I can't get a reservation.  This is by far the best restaurant in the area and perhaps in the entire Pittsburgh area.  

We started with a sample cheese plate that include all 5 cheeses they offered.  If you don't like strong cheeses, such as Asiago, then you might not like this appetizer, but since I do, I really enjoyed them and they give you quite a lot of each type of cheese.  The bread and butter (I believe it was a honey butter) was very good as well.  The butter was sweet, but not over sweet.  The salad that comes with the meal was a very good size and the sweet balsamic dressing was one of the best balsalmic dressings that I've had.

We also tried the meatballs.  The problem with the meatballs is that I could eat an entire plate of them myself and then not have any room for the entree.  The meatballs were fantastic...possibly the best I ever had (sorry Mom).  They weren't drowning in sauce, but the there was enough sauce on the plate to complement the meatballs perfectly.  I could go back daily just for the meatballs!

It was tough deciding on which main course to eat.  I ended up having the Linguine with lump crabmeat.  It was delicious and I even ate the whole thing.  My wife had one of the specials...lobster ravioli.  Fortunately for me, she couldn't finish them because of all the food we had already eaten and she was kind enough to share the leftovers the next day.  My dinner was excellent, but her lobster ravioli were out of this world.  

We were too full for dessert, but they brought us out a plate of small almond cookies with a small shot of limoncello.  That was such a perfect ending to such a delicious meal and it really hit the spot.

Usually there is a down side to a meal, such as the service was slow or one part of the meal wasn't up to standard, but I have to say that each and every part of this meal exceeded my expectations.  Our waiter was on top of everything.  Our food came out timely and we never felt rushed through our meal.  Our water glasses were always being filled.  Although you can BYOB, we chose not to this dinner, but the next time, I can see me having a nice bottle of Chianti with me to make my meal even more perfect...if that is even possible."}
{"text":"When your Italian-Greek family says they want a \"light lunch\" you know that you're probably going to end up being too stuffed to walk after said lunch. Cenacolo is a great venue for this sort of eating. Portions and prices are the same at lunch as they are for dinner. this is more of an upscale restaurant, and their prices reflect that. However your taste buds WILL be transported to Italy. The pasta I had at Cenacolo is one of the absolute best meals I've ever had in my life. our waitress Lauretta was super friendly and accommodating.

We started our meal with the Carciofini Fritti which is basically a fried artichoke appetizer which was an amazing note to start the meal off on, We ordered a charcuterie/cheese board where you can choose between a variety of different cheeses and meats. Everything was delicious though I would've liked for them to have had some softer options. Our 'choose seven' selection consisted of; Prosciutto di Parma, Sweet Sopressata,Hot Sopressata, Speck, truffled cheddar, & a double portion of the smoked cheese. The only ~meh~ part of the entire meal was the smoked goat cheese which was in part my own fault because I falsely assumed it would be soft instead of hard. I should've just gotten more prosciutto (lol). 

I even thought the salad that was served with the entree was superb. A nice portion of arugula and heirloom cherry tomatoes in a bowl licking good balsamic dressing, topped with shaved parmigiana. 

The four cheese ravioli were supposedly awesome (according to my brother). The Ricciolina al Forno was a perfect long noodle with Pork Belly, Caramelized Onions, Gouda Cream, and Breadcrumbs, such a perfectly balanced dish while a bit on the salty side that was due to how much parmigiana my brother piled on.

The Tagliolini was a scrumptious \"Flat Spaghetti Pasta\" with Garlic, Chives, Lemon, Parmesan and *copious* amounts of Crabmeat. My mother got this preparation though ordered it with pappardelle in place of the tagliolini. This was amazing and left me longing for another dinner here in the middle of my current meal.

The Lobster Agnolotti was basically half moon Ravioli with Garlic, Spinach, Tomatoes, Truffle Cream, and a generous portion of lobster. Honestly their lobster agnolotti is on the list of dishes I'll be thinking of on my death bed.

After finishing up the gratis limoncello and amaretto cookies, our waitress set down a crab bruscetta appetizer at another table that looked amazing, heaping mounds of crab meat that tempt me to come back for dinner.

Basically Cenacolo is a great word-of-mouth type of thing in an unassuming business park but once you discover this gem you'll be hard pressed to find another 'pastah' place where you leave with left overs and the same post orgasmic dining bliss.

P.S. It's BYOB up to 1 bottle for every 4 diners though they also have an extensive wine menu.

{"text":"Unbelievable food and service. Seriously had one of the best meals of my life. The meatballs are amazing. Every entree at our table was flavorful and hearty. I had my lobster ravioli for dinner and lunch the next day. Salads were fresh and the dressing delicious. I can't even express how much we enjoy this place! Nice ambiance for a night out. Fast and friendly servers but you don't feel rushed. A little pricy but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Never have been disappointed here. Worth going. I'd also recommend going to the whisky bar in the back of del forno for a night cap"}
{"text":"This is one of the best, if not THE BEST, Italian restaurants around. Other restaurants get their pasta from here. The ambiance is great. It's John on my list of favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Amazing from start to finish! My boyfriend and I got the fried artichokes, salad, rigatoni (big enough to share), and cheesecake. Each bite was better than the last and the service was great! It is byob so we brought a bottle of wine, but they also have a full service bar! We will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"I got the Riccolina about 2 winters ago.   It had chicken in it, IT WAS AMAZING!  Went back this year and there was no chicken in the Riccolina.  Very disappointed.  If they happen to change the Riccolina back to chicken in it I will 100% give them back their 5 stars."}
{"text":"Despite the very seldom few bad reviews on here about this place & the owner,it is purely a gem, amazing, wonderful, and well worth dining experience. Unfortunately, if the owner was rude to customers in the past, he most likely did not loose very much money because my first time dining here on a gloomy Friday night the place was packed. It is always busy, because the food is to die for and when you have excellent food, people may over look an incident that happened mind you on one of the busiest dining days of the year for most restaurants(being I worked in one since age 16, & put myself thru college at Pitt working in one.) 

I went here for my birthday with my boyfriend. Our waitress was good, but the girl who seated us and whom I believe is partial owner was amazing to us. I am a very healthy person, and in order to avoid over eating foods such as creamy heavy pasta, I sometimes ask my boyfriend to share dishes with me. The waitress thought we were being cheap? But we left her over 20% and working in a restaurant I did not really appreciate that , but at this time the salad came it did not even matter. I did have to flag the bus boy to grab our waitress a few times which also bugged me, like she did not intentionally come over because she figured what was the point? Well $25 on an $80 check cash did not seem like a bad deal to me for her, and hoping we do not get her next time as our waitress. 

It did not even matter, and I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK FOR MORE, hopefully with a different waitress, may be the host who seated us and cared to come over and ask us how everything was will next time. The girl who seated us was welcoming, inviting, refreshing, and made us feel very comfortable. 

Also there is a section of the restaurant where all the pasta is made FRESH, along with a glass case of Italian deli meats, cheeses, sauces, etc. you could purchase. My boyfriend who is obsessed with Italian foods and culture was like a little kid in a candy shop.

I ordered the Bruco pasta with Sangria for a drink and it was by the far the best pasta dish in Westmoreland county I have ever had, and the best Sangria as well for the wine drinkers. 
My boyfriend ordered a red sauce seafood linguini pasta which was also to die for, he claimed it was to die for( did not try due to a shell fish allergy). 
We had cheese cake for dessert which was also to die for. This place is doing it the right way, great vibe, beautiful layout formerly an industrial park and converted their space to a restaurant . Purely amazing. Definitely a gem, and definitely for people who have class, and can appreciate true Italian food. If you are a fan of Olive Garden, this place is not for you. Sorry. 

Its byob one bottle of wine per table, plus corking fee. People should not complain about the price, good food is well worth paying for, and I am happy to support a local small business blowing all the corporate bs restaurant chains out the water any day."}
{"text":"Super delicious food! Love the olives they bring you when you sit down, loved the salad, loved the bread with honey butter, loved the spaghetti & meat sauce, loved the lemoncello shot with a cookie they bring you after you're meal. Seriously, such a nice experience from start to finish. Not a cheap place for sure, but so worth the treat! They give you lots too, so I look at it like an investment in my next couple of meals  great service too, super friendly!"}
{"text":"Another amazing dinner at Cenacola last night! We are never disappointed when we dine here! We started our meal with a meat and cheese board which was amazing. Then the salads...I think my favorite part of the meal! The dressing is heavenly! For our main course our party of seven dined family style on ricotta gnocchi with short rib ragu (my fave), strozzapreti (spicy- my husband's fave), and tagliatelle with seafood (scallops and mussels were awesome). We all ate more than our fill and still had three large to-go containers, enough for lunch the next day! We enjoyed three bottles of wine, two purchase there and one we brought in (corking fee). And the perfect ending to their meals is their lemoncello and divine cookies! This is the perfect place to go for a special occasion or a date night...or pretty much any time you want an amazing Italian meal with awesome service and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! We had my friend's bridal shower here recently. The staff was super accommodating with everything we needed and super helpful. The back room was cozy and the decor was super cute. It fit with our theme quite well.  We were able to choose three entrees off the brunch menu and ended up going with the french toast which was served with a caramel banana pecan sauce, a grilled cheese panini served with marinara, a fruit salad with a topping, and fried potatoes with a short rib ragu topped with poached eggs and hollendaise. Didn't try the potatoes and eggs but everything I put in my mouth was amazing! Everyone was raving over the food. I can't wait to go back and eat more. Our server Paul was very attentive and really helped make our shower perfect."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service every time we've been there! The limoncello at the end of the meal is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant!  Last night we went for the first time to take advantage of a free meal offered for veterans. How wonderful is that?!Not just a limited selection, but any entree from the menu. 
Atmosphere inside is lovely and the service was very good.
There were three of us and we all had superbly prepared pasta dishes. My husband, the veteran, had the Tagliatelle. Spicy marinara over loads of fresh seafood and perfectly al dente noodles. He loved it! I had the Giglio which was lily pasta, shrimp, broccolini, tomatoes and garlic in a pistachio pesto sauce. OMG! Delish! Our son enjoyed the Rigatoni with hot sausage and banana peppers. It was pretty spicy but he loved it. The sausage tasted very lean , not fatty at all. All the pastas were hand made right there. Can't get any fresher than that!
Our appetizer was the Fried Artichokes with lemon and basil. It was excellent. They give you so much food, you could skip the appetizer, but there are so many to try, next time we want the Crab Bruschetta . They give complimentary olives, arugula salad and delicious bread with the meal. Although we were stuffed, we wanted to try a dessert and my husband chose the Tiramisu. Wonderful!
Again, complimentary home made limoncello and anise cookies were given after the meal. We all took home half of our entrees and are enjoying them a second time today for lunch!
Can't wait to go back and try some different dishes."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for anything Italian and this place does it right! The pasta is made in house and it's definitely apparent in the taste. You can bring your own bottle of wine, but they do have a liquor license now. The meat and cheese trays for an appetizer are great! You can select from several options and it's all sliced to order. The location is a little strange being that it is located in an industrial park, but do not let that steer you away."}
{"text":"Wow.  What a difference a second visit provided.  So disappointed.

We were seated in at a table that just shouldn't even be there.  I felt severely cramped.  I couldn't sit any further from the table than I was because of the close proximity of the chair behind me and my husband's seat was literally sticking out into the hallway.  I thought about just giving up at that moment and going elsewhere but it was his birthday dinner someplace supposedly special based on our last visit so he moved the table and his chair back a bit and we decided to stick it out for some great food.

Ummm... not really.

The menu options looked great.  I ordered the butternut squash gnocchi with brussel sprouts (ok, I absolutely love brussel sprouts so any dish with them was going to be my first choice) and he ordered hot sausage rigatoni.  They both came with salads and we were provided hot bread.  Sounds like a winner.

Ummm.. not really.

When served, first off, you'd think that an Italian place (upscale Italian) would offer fresh cheese grated on top.  Not so.... Ok, but I bet it's gonna be scrumptious, way above the chain restaurant that pleases us every time.  Not so...  

I like butternut squash.  Makes a good side dish and I've had it in ravioli and loved it.  Not this time.  The dish was ugly to the eye.  It was all brown, gravy brown.  Ok, but it'll be great (you get the drift -- always hoping).  The butternut squash's sweetness was overpowering.  They must have added ingredients on the sweet side because it was wayyyy overpowering.  I would never had known there were brussel sprouts buried in the brown gravy-like substance except it was on the menu and I was looking forward to it.  Well, no taste or texture of it to be found.  

The main issue I have that reduced this review to 2 stars was my entire meal.  How can you have every single part of my meal be sweet?  From the butter on the bread (good, but sweet something added), to my salad with a sweet vinaigrette, to my whole main hugely portioned plate of sickly sweet entrée, to the free dessert of lemon cello shot with a side cookie.  Seriously?  Had the chef gone mad?  Don't get me wrong.  I have a sweet tooth, just not in every single bite/drink I took.  That is what gets you the 2 stars.

And the rigatoni?  Not bad, just not spectacular.

Meh....This venue that missed and is more expensive and cramped or my chain restaurant that gets it right every time?"}
{"text":"We went to Cenacolo for the first time and absolutely loved it! 

The pasta dishes all looked amazing as we watched them being delivered to the tables around us. I ordered the Strozzapreti and my husband ordered the short rib gnocchi. We both loved our meals. Mine had some kick from the banana peppers and was full of flavor. His was rich and flavorful as well. 

All entrees come with arugula salads and delicious bread for the table, so if the prices seem off-putting, keep this in mind. Also, the entree portions are very generous. The appetizers looked great but we never would have been able eat it all! 

We will definitely be going back and recommend Cenacolo to all lovers of great Italian food."}
{"text":"I'll be very concise in regards to Cenacolo. It's exceptional. Over the top really. Perhaps even other worldly. 

What they've got going on at Cenacolo is just something special. Located in an industrial warehouse/old factory/odd-ball building is probably one of the premier Italian restaurants in South Western Pennsylvania. 

Everything is handmade. We've been to Cenacolo four times. On our first visit the server Paul suggested the Rigatoni. I've been hooked ever since. I've tried to get away from it and have been wanting to try other items on the menu such as the Strozzapreti, but the rigatoni pulls me back and for good reason. The pork ragu is perfectly cooked. The pork just falls apart. The herbs and garlic bring it all together. Bear in mind the menu on their website list the old rigatoni plate which had sausage and hot peppers. They changed it up and it is different now, certainly for the better I'm sure.

Damn, I skipped the salad and went straight to the main course. The salads at Cenacolo are very nice. Arugula, heirloom cherry tomatoes of all colors, shaved parmesan and probably the best balsamic glaze dressing I've ever tried and I can't stand balsamic-anything.

Another hot item is the Ricotta Gnocchi. I personally don't like Gnocchi, normally they're heavy, as if you are a brick. Not these little pillows. They're light and flavorful. They're not a potato dumpling. The braised short rib ragu with which they're served is similar to the one served with the Rigatoni.

We've tried all of the appetizers save for maybe one. The most recent being the sausage and peppers. It was totally my thing. Ground sausage, peppers, herbs, garlic, parmesan and crusty bread. It could have been a meal in and of itself.

They have the obligatory Italian desserts, tiramisu, cheesecake, etc. Their tiramisu is good, however I don't go to Cenacolo for the desserts. It's all about the entree. 

Dinner is finished off with a shot of limoncello and a cookie. A nice gesture! 

Make a reservation and go!"}
{"text":"We've now been to Cenacolo a half dozen times and it truly gets better every time. Before we left for our house Friday night dinner I found myself sitting on my couch dreaming of the hot soppressata appetizer and the arugula salad...and it was better than I had remembered from the last time! The atmosphere is incredible and the service is excellent. Our waitress Kim W was so friendly and extremely helpful...this place is definitely my fiancé's and my favorite place to eat!!!"}
{"text":"Having recently benefited from the wonders of gastric surgery, every bite that goes into my mouth has become that much more important.

Looking for a new place to try close to home, I came across Cenacolo here on Yelp.  I convinced my Hubby to come out and give it a try....OMG, my teeny-tiny tummy was in heaven!

I had the Crab Bruschetta.  WONDERFUL!  Lots of tasty crab, you could easily taste the quality of the crab meat...and there was no skimping there.  The toasty slices of obviously homemade bread were brushed with a wonderfully seasoned olive oil and PILED HIGH with crab meat in a very flavorful sauce...yum!  Sprinkled generously with diced tomatoes that actually tasted like tomatoes instead of under ripe cardboard....tomato lovers I know you feel me on that one!

My main course was the Lobster Agnolotti (ravioli)...again, a party in my mouth.  LARGE chunks of lobster, noted to include chunks that were obviously from the claws, and many of them...in a wonderful cream sauce, enhanced with fresh scallions, colored grape tomatoes, spinach and a very tasty fresh ?parmigiana/romano? Cheese (I am not Italian, so that is only my best guess...and please excuse my spelling).

Long story short.....I thought it was wonderful!  My Hubs and I brought 99% of our meal home...me with my surgery and he's just a nibbler.  But be assured, he was up at 12am having a bruschetta for a snack and his Short Rib Gnocchi went to work this morning for lunch.

I shared some of my Lobster Ravioli with my son...who, after two bites promptly described it as \"lobster crack\", and I will be taking the rest to work this afternoon.

The one and only disappointment that I had was the arugula salad.  I'm sorry I just wish there was another choice for the greens besides the arugula which I am not a fan of, but that is a personal choice.  The dressing was awesome the shaved cheese was a real treat and the generous portion of tomatoes in the salad was good enough for any tomato lover.

That being said I'm giving it 5 Stars anyway because seriously folks it was just salad greens everything else was perfect the service was wonderful the waitress was very knowledgeable regarding the menu and help those of us who don't speak Italian Translate that lovely language into food we could understand...

The final bill came to just over $82 which I fully expected, having ordered both the crab and the lobster dishes.  I looked at the lunch menu and it was very reasonable.  I was completely satisfied with the portions I received for the price and the quality was outstanding! If you're trying to impress a date I would take them to Cenacolo... Ambiance was beautiful and intimate but casual dress perfectly accepted. 

 This venue was something I never expected to find out here in North Huntington and hidden away everyone will think you are \"in\" and Know all the secret places to eat."}
{"text":"Wow. This must be where good Italian girls go when they die. It's pasta heaven!

I was out around the area getting my car fixed and decided to check Yelp for some local restaurant recommendations for lunch. Thank goodness for the Yelpverse because there's no way I would have found this place otherwise. It's tucked away in an industrial park near, what seems to be, the middle of nowhere. 

The interior is so charming. Upon entering, you'll see a fresh pasta counter to your left where you can browse and buy the various gluten laden nuggets of goodness. To the right, there is a romantic little dining area.  

The staff were friendly and gracious. We started with some absolutely delicious fried artichokes. I'm amazed that these are not listed on more Italian restaurant menus-- I'd take these over fried zucchini any day. DO YOU HEAR ME, ITALIAN RESTAURANTS OF THE WORLD? FRY UP SOME ARTICHOKES! 

I had the ricotta gnocchi with short rib ragu. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the short rib was melt in my mouth delicious. The whole dish was just a touch on the salty side, but not enough to ruin the experience. 

The meal ended with some of the best limoncello I've ever tasted and some lovely little amaretto cookies. What a sweet surprise!

I do wish there was a separate lunch menu. Perhaps smaller portions that are easier on the wallet? My husband and I ended up spending close to $80 (we didn't even have any alcohol) and I had leftovers for days."}
{"text":"You have not had Italian food...ever...don't believe me? Try this place. You will develop an entirely new baseline of what TRUE Italian cuisine is. JUST INCREDIBLE."}
{"text":"I should have listened to the negative reviews on Yelp about Cenacolo. My party showed up last night with reservations for 12 at 7PM for New Year's Eve dinner and waited for our table for over 45 minutes. I also need to say at this point in my review that when the reservations were made over a month ago Cenacolo still had a BYOB and uncorking fee wine policy, which apparently changed prior to last night.  While we were waiting we were approached by their extremely respectful and courteous wait staff and they offered to uncork our wine and give us glasses. I guess we assumed incorrectly this meant we could also open and consumer the beer, which was in no way hidden when we entered the restaurant. So if their policy referring to beer changed they could have let us know as soon as we entered the premises.

While consuming our beverages a guy named Steve, who claimed to be the owner, approached us and very rudely informed us their policy changed. We apologized as we had no idea of the change in policy. He actually went as far as grabbing a tablet and show us with an attitude that showed he had something to prove as he clearly didn't want us patronizing his business. Fortunately we had the confirmation email pulled up to show him how we thought we were authorized to do this. 

This is where we asked him when will our table be ready and his reply as he turned towards the door was, \"you're welcome to leave if you like.\"...who does that? As we were waiting 45 min we still desired to eat...but not so much at this location as we once did...we didn't leave and that's when we were informed if we wanted our table we were more than welcome to ask the party occupying it to leave. What kind of business does this? I get it you're busy and I anticipate a delay in getting our table especially on a holiday, but it's still YOUR job as the business to control the flow not your customers.

A member of our party at this point approached Steve, told him, \"thank you, but I don't think we will be dining here this evening. What's your name?\"

Steve replied with his name and added, \"you can go ahead and write that in your review.\" 

To which I interjected, \"wow, that was extremely disrespectful and rude.\"

Steve replied, \"your entire party has been nothing but rude and disrespectful since you walked in here.\" I looked perplexed so he tried and used one of his wait staff as a scapegoat to give an example. His request surprised the waiter and he looked just as confused as me.

I am the supervisor of over 100 people and would NEVER do that to one of my employees. What kind of employer would treat his employees like that?

At that point I called him out on it and told him he was jerk, but used a less family friendly word to describe him, his attitude, and his actions. We left at that point and took our business to Lucci's. Thank you Lucci's for saving our night and accepting our money because Cenacolo obviously didn't want it. I suggest everyone think twice about ever patronizing a business with such poor leadership as this. Do you honestly want your money going in to this jerk's pocket? I for one do not and will never return.

{"text":"Love the food and the atmosphere   Went too a bar opening event and stayed for dinner. Service awesome. The event had drinks and appetizers. They kept bringing out more and more food. I had their spinach and asiago ravioli best I ever had.   Nice selection of wines. Appetizers I prefer are the homemade mozzarella, artichokes and the meatballs A great place to go anytime   Also have been to their Sunday brunch. We love to have our family Sunday meals here   Their bacon is to die for"}
{"text":"Wow.  Seriously.

First, the ambiance:  It was unique, intimate and welcoming.  Definitely a Tuscan feel, but not like \"hey look! grape vines! Goooo Italy!\" - more like a home-style come on in and get comfortable setting. 

We started with a cheese board.  Wisconsin cheddar truffle, imported Asiago and spicy Sopresatta.  Very nice.  This was followed by the house salad which was arugula with a sweet balsamic dressing.

Maltagliati (my new favorite word) is their Braised Rabbit served over square pasta with tomatoes.  It was just fantastic - perfectly seasoned and packed with flavors that complemented one another.  Hubs had the Rigatoni which was served with spicy Sicilian sausage and banana peppers and he was extremely pleased.  

For dessert we had a coconut peach concoction that while good, was not great - but perhaps we were just too full to give it the attention it deserved.

To wrap, complimentary limoncello in frosted shot glasses - perfect.

This is a BYOB, with no cork fee.  Also, water is served in individual table carafes and as a water hound, this is always a plus for me.  Service was A+!

We were there on a Thursday night and it was pretty packed, reservations are a must, I feel.  We will definitely go back, as I'm ashamed to admit that I have no idea what our friends ordered...  we were engrossed in great food + the great conversation that comes so easy when everything clicks with a really terrific dining experience!"}
{"text":"After hearing top notch reviews from our friends who had visited Cenacolo, we finally had a chance to give it a try.  One bite into our appetizer we both stated \"What took us so long to come here?!\"
Service was impeccable, friendly and efficient.  Every bite of food that we had was delicious.  Comparable to Girasole in Shadyside...but better, in my opinion.  I have heard that Girasole uses Fede Pasta, so that would justify their similarity in taste.  We both had the lobster ravioli, and it was nothing short of incredible.
Reservations are a must, and they seem to be very prompt with seating times (we arrived 10 minutes prior to our reservation and were seated immediately).  Space is small, but there is ample elbow room.  
Keep up the great work guys, we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love the food at Cenacolo. It has become our favorite place for a dinner out alone. All the appetizers are delicious but the fresh mozzarella is out of this world. I really like the arugula salad with the balsamic dressing. My husband finds the dressing too sweet. My favorite entree has been any kind of gnocchi. We have found the desserts to be underwhelming. The atmosphere is ok, but the acoustics are not very good and there seem to be loud drunk people very near our table every time we go."}
{"text":"Cute rustic feel but hidden place. The food is amazing!!! Coffee is delicious. We ordered the meatball appetizer and it was so good! The salad that comes with the entree is amazing haha the entree is delicious! Big portion entree. I got the lobster agnolotti but it was a little on the salty end. The bread and their honey butter is also great! Service is also great. Pretty much everything is great!! Good for group things as well."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! I have never been disappointed in any menu ordered. The staff is always so friendly and provides the perfect amount of attention. From appetizer, to salad, to bread, to entree, to dessert... each part is absolutely delicious. My favorite appetizer is the fresh mozzarella. We love the Bruco pasta dish and no matter how stuffed we are, we never leave without getting the creme brûlée cheesecake. I think it is so kind of them to bring lemoncello and little cookies at the end of every meal with their check. You also can't beat the $10 corkage fee for byob. 

We have always made reservations, but after a particularly bad week... we decided a good meal was needed. We didn't have much hope, but figured that we would call to see if they had any open tables last Friday night. They were so accommodating and actually squeezed us in between 2 reservations. 

This is our go-to place for celebrating birthdays, anniversaries and milestones. 

Thank you for having such a welcoming and delicious restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is probably the fifth time having dinner here and the only reasons I didn't give it a 5 star was we were a group of 10.   Those of u who know already know why.  Anyhow some of our favorite items are no longer on the menu to include the Calabrese peppers and mozzarella balls.  Anyhow we didn't want to have a family style dinner for equal amount.  Outside of that the food is always great."}
{"text":"My family and I will NEVER come back here. First of all it was so loud that you couldn't hear the person next to you. Second of all the service was slow and when we paid our bill the waitress brought us the wrong credit card back. We had to ask other workers just to get her back so we could get the card before someone left. 
   The worst was a large group of people who sat in a small room with us. They were piss drunk and screaming while they were having a conversation. They loudly made in fun of the other guests at the restaurant, used curse words like C*nt, F*ggot, F*cker, and other completely inappropriate words. Multiple members of the staff had witnessed this group of people and said nothing. Completely offended, we asked to see a manager, to which none could be found. There was NO manager there on a saturday night. We told, who we think was the chef, about how offended we were by what had happened to which he said it's hard to control people. Well It's your restaurant and instead of asking a group of four people to quite down or leave, they let an entire room of people be ridiculed and bullied. 
Not only will we NEVER go back to the restaurant, but my family and I are telling everyone about our horrible experience. 
I have never been so offended in my life and I lived in NYC."}
{"text":"A friend has been talking about this establishment for months. She loves the atmosphere, the menu, and that you can buy their products. I now am a believer. 

The intimate dining room is soooo indicative of Italy. Very simplistic and welcoming.   The owners and staff welcomed us like family (which rarely happens at other establishments)and impressed me immensely. 

After intense pondering we ordered the charcuterie and salad. Enjoyed a bottle of wine, and ended the meal with chilled lemonicello. Fabulous. The gentlemen next to us had the meatball appetizer and two pasta entrees which smelled and looked divine. 

Before we left I purchased a loaf of their home baked bread, and my friend bought fresh pasta and sauces to have for dinner later this week. Looked awesome. 

Go. You will be glad you did. I know I am."}
{"text":"Ate here for brunch and it did not disappoint!  Had the spinach and mushroom omelet, americano, and french toast.  EVERYTHING was excellent, down to the sausage and bacon.  The portions were huge!  Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. It is the very best Italian restaurant that we have been to in Western PA. Amazing that it is located in a corporate park, and very out of the way. The cheesy bread with their homemade mozzarella was a great way to start. Yummy! A salad comes with the main course. The arugula salad with the best balsamic dressing I have ever had was excellent. Each of our main courses was fantastic. All of the pastas are made there. I had the pasta with seafood. The mussels were the best I have ever had, along with shrimp, scallops, and calamari. My husband had the pasta with the crabmeat. There was a lot of crab and the sauce was delicious. We will definitely return. It is more expensive than most Italian restaurants but worth every penny."}
{"text":"This place is great - it ranks up there with my favorite Italian places in Chicago. I try to go every time I am back in Pittsburgh visiting family. I really like the Tagliolini (homemade pasta with crab meat, lemon, garlic, and parmesan) and the meatballs made with Prosciutto & Mortadella. The entree portions are huge, and the BYOW makes it all even better."}
{"text":"Great Italian food. 4 of ate here on a Saturday evening. Make sure you have 
Reservations as this is a popular spot. Ingredients fresh and food is wonderful.
We'll be returning soon."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for dinner here last night after seeing the stellar Yelp reviews and photos. This gem of a restaurant is tucked away in an industrial/business park. There is also a local brewery a couple of doors down that serve Cenacola's pizza (Quinn Brewing). 

The restaurant is beautiful. The walls are dark stained shiplap and there are pretty lights and candles on the tables. We were greeted with complimentary olives that were palatable and delicious. We brought a bottle of wine for a $10 corkage fee. The server really seemed to love the food here and she gave us wonderful descriptions of a few signature dishes. To start, we had the Burrino; slices of bread with melted fresh mozzarella and butter. We could have ended the meal here because it was so delicious and satisfying. 

Before our pasta dishes arrived, our server brought us complimentary bread and salad. The salad was arugula with a generous amount of shaved Parmesan, fresh and ripe heirloom cherry tomatoes, and a sweet house made balsamic vinaigrette. I absolutely loved this simple fresh salad! The bread was served with house made honey butter that my partner LOVED! 

For our entrees, I had the Bruco and my partner had the four cheese ravioli with meat sauce. The meat is ground in house. The cheese inside the ravioli tasted fresh and the pasta was al dente. I loved the Bruco, it was creamy and had a delicious amount of truffle oil. We were so stuffed that we could barely dig in to my pasta at this point.

We passed on dessert, but the next time we go we will skip an appetizer so we have room for dessert. With our check came complimentary sweet and tart limoncello and crunchy amaretto cookies. It was a perfect way to end a meal. I was very happy with all of the food we ordered, and the complimentary goodies from beginning to end really added a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Really good meal. Everything was cooked well. Prices are a little high but do include a salad, bread with honey butter, a lemoncello shot, and small cookie with your pasta! I got the squid ink pasta with langostinos, as well as the burrata and breaded artichokes and all were really good. Salad was ok, needed more of a vinegarette in my opinion, not a balsamic reduction, but still good. The banana bruelee cheesecake was amazing and the Italian coffee was very good as well. Our waitress was really nice and the atmosphere seemed very friendly."}
{"text":"OMG! Where do I start!!! Food, service, ambiance all amazing 
Salad was fresh and delicious with a blanket of tart but sweet vinaigrette.  My meal was robust with flavor. I cannot wait to come back"}
{"text":"They have amazing Italian food! I got the seafood pasta with shrimp, scallops, mussels and calamari in it which was very good! The honey butter they give you for the bread is delicious."}
{"text":"Pricey but excellent, fresh handmade noodles and sauce. All the food I've ever had here was great. It's definitely a little gem found in the middle of an industrial park."}
{"text":"This place certainly qualifies as a 'hidden' gem, emphasis on the hidden part--it's in a peculiar spot, with an inauspicious door in a large building complex on a quiet \"main\" street leading to their restaurant/pasta production area (they make pasta for a bunch of other restaurants too).

Luckily, the food is worth the drive out to the area and the high price tag. Had three dishes, including a pasta with crabmeat, a pasta with shrimp, and a ravioli with corn. The crabmeat pasta stood out the most, with a light lemon sauce--I'd have added capers but it was ok as is. The shrimp had a nice pesto seasoning; I would've liked to have seen bigger shrimp bu the flavor was nice. The corn ravioli were quite tasty. Large serving sizes mean that unless you're a football player, you're probably taking home part of your meal."}
{"text":"Family owned and operated these folks are killing it. If you want a taste of Italy get your butts in those seats, it's worth the dining experience. I cannot wait to get my hands on more of their fresh pasta! Hopefully they will ship it to Cypress Texas. Can't wait to return.  Love your food and passion"}
{"text":"Amazing. I don't t think I will ever be able to have italian food anywhere else. We started with the Polpette, meatballs made with prosciutto, mortadella, garlic. Served in a marinara sauce with grated and shaved cheese -  delicious. I had Bruco, wavy pasta with mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, and mascarpone cream. OMG, I think it was the best meal I've ever eaten. My husband had Ricotta gnocchi with a short rib Ragu , it was delectable. We sat at the bar because we didn't have reservations. We enjoyed watching the mozzarella being fresh hand pulled, and the bruschette and cappuccinos being made. It was  show. This was a very nice, relaxing evening, a dining experience I highly recommend. This restaurant is not the place to go if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that I found pretty hard to find, tucked away in a commercial/business area where you really would not expect to find a restaurant like this.  Google maps on my phone was no help either, and it is poorly marked with I think only one very small inconspicuous sign to direct you.  Once inside, though, was a very nice store/restaurant.  We got there in the mid-afternoon on a Wednesday, and there was almost no one there - but I have been told that it gets quite busy during the weekends, and that reservations are recommended.  The pasta was fresh and excellent, and the pasta sauces were super yummy.  I got a spicy marinara - definitely had a little kick, but not overpowering in any way.  She got the brucco pasta with mascarpone cream and truffle sauce.  Hers was very tasty, and incredibly rich.  She loved it and took it home - her entree was 2 meals for her.  From what I understand, this place is a small fresh pasta factory - so they make all of their pasta fresh every day.  Their store is also cute - and we got some pasta to take home as well.  Service was very nice and friendly.  Unfortunately, far away from Pittsburgh - but I will head back there when I can.  Oh - and even though they have a full wine menu, but they are BYOB as well - very usual, and awesome."}
{"text":"Unbelievable meal and service!! I can't wait to go back--from beginning to end, just amazing!"}
