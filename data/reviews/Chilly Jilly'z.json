{"text":"Honestly jill the owner absolutely gives the best customer service i love their spinach tri tip wraps they are to die for everything is soooo amazing you must go there at least once in your life"}
{"text":"Nice little place.  Had the pastrami rueben sandwich and a chocolate shake.  Both were delicious.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really nice service and great food their pannani  is the best I've ever had. They have tater tot's two that are great."}
{"text":"We went there last week and all ordered burgers and fries. We all liked it very much and will definitely be back. Worth the drive if your a local or a tourist from out of town."}
{"text":"Dole whip floats!! My husband and I just had to go after our soccer game. This is a cute little place, very clean and nicely decorated. I loved the broasted chicken!! Just so crunchy and well cooked, the flavor was outstanding. The Mac and cheese was good too.   I think I'm going to be dreaming about that broasted chicken."}
{"text":"We were looking for a caterer for our company picnic and didn't have to go far to find great food and excellent service in Boulder City from Chilly Jilly'z!!!  They delivered a party-in-the-park as we scheduled a catered party for 50 at the Veteran's Memorial Park next to the waterpark so the kids could eat and play.  It was the best event and we didn't lift a finger - it was actually one of the best company parties we've had and I owe it all to Jill.  She and her team created the perfect menu for our event and surprised us all with extras.  While we were looking for some nice lunchtime favorites for about 30 people, Chilly Jilly'z delivered above and beyond by providing extra touches like treats disguised as table decorations, unique desserts, etc., and nobody left hungry. You'll be thanked by everyone on your crew if you call Jill - I can't thank her enough!"}
{"text":"We were on the way back from a visit to the Hoover Dam in the afternoon and saw a sign out side of Chilly Jilly'z that said Shaved Ice.  Well, being from Hawaii we decided to take a break and eat some Shaved Ice.  Sadly to say the Shaved Ice was more of chipped ice than shaved ice.  I suspect that the ice was crushed in a blender vice being shaved.  We also paid extra to have condensed milk added to the Shaved Ice but you couldn't even taste it.  Overall the Shaved Ice is not of the same quality that you can find from shops in Hawaii.  We had ordered strawberry Shaved Ice but the syrup used on the Shaved Ice tasted like that of what you would use in a slush or perhaps even juice.  On the plus side was the selection of yogurt and toppings were plentiful and tasty."}
{"text":"The pastrami sandwich is great.  I always compare the pastrami sandwich to The Hat in California.  It not as much meat, but the flavor is superior.  The sandwiches and salads are very good."}
{"text":"After eating a ton of food on the go.... We stumbled upon this little gem! I'm seriously obsessed!!! I live inAtlanta and we have plenty of juicing and smoothie bars. Chilly Jilly's is amazing! I had a sandwich a side item and a juice for the road! I can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"These guys really know how to make fried chicken and the jalapeño potato salad was great too!"}
{"text":"The best damn panni was unbelievable, the. Pineapple float was also very refreshing. First time eating there but not the last."}
{"text":"My family needed some fried chicken on a Sunday night and we called in advance to make sure they would still be open.  Driving from Henderson to Boulder City you don't want to be disappointed.  We ordered a 12 piece family meal that includes their huge potato fries and mac & cheese.  A couple of large drinks later and a decent tip and we're at $42.50.  There is always a wait for good fried chicken so we chilled out watching the staff and other customers.  Once the meal arrived we were given two trays of food - Twelve pieces of beautiful chicken, at least six potatoes turned into piping hot fries, a big container of mac & cheese, and eight biscuits.  The chicken and fries are so hot you have to wait a few minutes to eat lest you burn your mouth but the flavor is fantastic.  We couldn't eat everything so quite a bit went home for the next couple of days.  My big son pigs out on the rest when he gets home from school so it never goes to waste."}
{"text":"Updating my review. I've been back a couple times since they moved into their bigger location across the street. Friendly staff, clean amenities, and very good baked goods. The monster cookie bar is my favorite.  My kids love the chicken but it is quite a wait for it (which they did warn me about...so no biggie).  Definitely give them a try. Great small business, and I love any excuse to get out to BC."}
{"text":"We love this place, something for everyone, and very well done at that. Remember they are new and will only get better. Love the broasted chicken, bakery and the staff is wonderful."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. Maybe I'm still hangry at it for leaving me dissatisfied.  I order the Best Dam sandwich without coleslaw. I'm not a fan of mayonnaise.  My husband ordered the pastrami and we got a chili cheese dog for baby.  The food took FOREVER.  I watched someone who had ordered before us - get there order, eat, and leave before our food had even arrived. I didn't realize it takes so long (especially since they have a drive-thru). My sandwich came smothered in mustard and mayonnaise (two things I really don't care for). I didn't even bother eating it. The mustard and mayonnaise were not listed as items on the sandwich or I would have ordered accordingly.  My husband said his sandwich was ok and the chili dog was basic. There are better options in BC."}
{"text":"Been there quite a few times when we go to Lake Mead.  Food is good. My complaint is that we were there on Senior Day that offers a 20% discount.  The sign was on top of the yogurt toppings case, and not where it was readily visible while looking at the main food menu. We noticed it only after our food arrived.  It would have been nice to have gotten the discount since it was offered.  My wife and I are in our mid 60's, and obviously Seniors.  The girl at the cash register could have said something about the discount."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Chilly Jilly'z coffee since I found their kiosk on Boulder Highway several months ago. I take my coffee seriously...and so does Chilly Jilly'z. They grind their beans fresh with each order and pour through right to the cup. Unbelievably tasty cup of joe!  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food offered here. I make a stop here a minimum of once a week for a box of the the scratch-made pastries that are totally out of control.  The service is always friendly and attentive. It can take a little while for the entire order to be completed and served, but what you end up with is made-to-order, high quality food and beverages.   Don't be surprised if you're lucky enough to have Jill make your coffee -- she definitely knows how to treat her customers."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly, frozen yogurt is great especially in this heat ! Worth the stop"}
{"text":"The staff is insanely nice and helpful day after day.... The smoothies r so packed and yummy and they can make a kale broccoli carrot smoothie taste like dessert! Plus, now, they're carrying the dogs from their hot dog stand that was across the street.....The Chicago dog is spot on!!!! =P"}
{"text":"Best breakfast around.  Always fresh, hot and reasonably priced.  Breakfast on the patio is wonderful.  Great service always very friendly.  We live in Henderson and make it a point to drive the extra 10 min... it's worth it.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way back from a float down the Colorado river. We had the 4pc. Meal to share and was so juicy and the jalapeño potato salad was delicious. We tried the pb bar dessert while waiting and ordered a dole white float to go. I enjoyed the float but think I'd prefer just getting the dole whip in a cup next time. We can't wait to go back and try more items off the menu. We were eyeing everyone's food they ordered. The hamburgers looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Dole Whips are my fave, but the Oatmeal Cookie pies are crazy good. Food is also tasty. We drive out from Henderson just to eat here!"}
{"text":"They need to open one of these in Las Vegas.  The fried chicken was fantastic, the best I have had in Nevada.  We also had the \"Best Damn Pannini\" and that was great too.  Their mac and cheese and potato salad was spicy good.  Too bad this place takes 40 minutes to get to from my house.  I'll stop by again next time I go to Boulder City."}
{"text":"This place is right off of the highway but very cute and has a mix of great food and drinks. We stopped today just to have a malt and shake after hanging in Boulder City. The girls are always very friendly. Shakes were great."}
{"text":"Went for Lunch food was good but I got mine 10 minutes after my co- worker got hers, had to ask for our drinks 2 times. Went for coffee before work it took 15 minutes and there was 5 people behind counter they need to have a sense of urgency..We were getting plain coffee too!"}
{"text":"This is the best chicken in Boulder City. I absolutely love the potato salad. I've also tried some if the salads and they taste great and fresh. I would definitely recommend this to a friend."}
{"text":"This is my second review for Chilly Jillyz. The staff continues to be phenominal! The sandwiches are awesome. I've had the chance to use this restaurant to cater a few events I have been involved in. Awesome service and everyone raved about their sandwiches and Asian Chicken Salad. Their Dole whip is a favorite of everyone in my family as well. The breakfast croissants with bacon are delicious, as are their chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. Its not even the food and believe me their food is awesome. Its the customer service, everyone is super friendly. Jill is a class act such a warm awesome person.  My fav is the broasted chicken"}
{"text":"Stopped for a cheeseburger with tator tots and fish and chips. Absolutely charming spot on the way to Hoover Dam. Great service and food was amazing. Ate on the patio outside. Good food, good value."}
{"text":"Great burger and they have tator tots! Fat kids indulge.  The froyo was awesome according to the kid.  Store and bathrooms clean. Nice people too"}
{"text":"I love this place! The Dole pineapple float is addicting! It's delicious without being too sweet. I didn't realize they had a drive thru window until I looked over my shoulder when I was feeding my little one. So next time, pineapple float to go!!! I ordered the 2 piece chicken with potatoes, and mac n cheese. It was very tasty. The girl behind the regieter is so nice, great service. :) I'll definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT place to eat after a day hiking or in Lake Mead. The food is fantastic, the service is fast and the entire restaurant is very clean. I have had both the pulled pork sandwich and the pastrami rueben and both were excellent. We will continue to eat at Chilly Jill'z on an regular basis."}
{"text":"We came here for our Sunday morning breakfast on The Patio and it was amazing! I had the chicken fried steak and it was the best I have ever had and I have had a lot. The batter was crispy and the gravy perfect. Served with home fries (or hash browns) and 2 eggs. The service is very welcoming and Jill and her mom are very nice people. Would highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"We have driven by a few times and always wanted to stop in, but after checking and saw the Broaster Chicken logo, I definitely wanted to try it. I was surprised by the menu size and their dessert offerings.   Of course, I ordered the broasted chicken with the sides. We also ordered extra wings and one sandwich/panini .  The food came out in the expected time frame,  and I was surprised to see the place filled to capacity but the staff were extremely helpful,  speed and  efficient.  The chicken was piping hot and crispy. The flavor was phenomenal. We were extremely happy with the portion sizes. The sides of potato wedges were flavorful and hot.  The potato salad seemed like it was store bought but was acceptable  Biscuits were hot, fluffy and we again were surprised that they served us REAL honey and butter packets and pats.  The sandwich we ordered was a turkey panini and was loaded w meat & cheese and was very good. The only downside was my own undoing, i eat way too much and didn't leave room for dessert....  The best part was the staff, extremely helpful, friendly and fast. The place was very clean and organized.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were on vacation this week, and had the chance to meet with family for dinner. We chose to try this place for dessert, but made a mistake coming 20 mins before closing. My sister in law went as far as apologizing to the  very unhappy cashier, who replied with attitude.  Between us all, we ordered snow cones, milkshakes, and the famous Dole whip. It was all yummy. We will go back again- but at least an hour before closing."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever on the patio!! We had chicken and waffles and the enchiladas special with eggs/carnitas and home fries! Wish we lived close by so we could come back and try all the other delicious options!"}
{"text":"If you're wanting a quick bite, don't recommend it. Waited over an hour on a Sunday morning to get our order in. The food however all tasted great! The waitress forgot to bring out our toast which was a bummer. Three star for the service, but great food!"}
{"text":"Excellent food,  excellent service.  Iced mochas are perfect every time.  I always get the single burger with tater tots, haven't had a bad experience here yet and don't think we ever will."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, amazing milkshakes!  My husband and I spotted this place across the street from a gas station and popped over. I got a strawberry shake and it was perfect.  Not too sweet.  It hit the spot after a tiring day at the lake."}
{"text":"Great coffee, and the Dole soft-serve is AWESOME!!  This is the only place I have seen with Dole soft-serve outside of Hawaii"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch today. Our food tasted great but we were very disappointed in the serving sizes for the money. I ordered the BBQ pulled chicken on a spinach wrap with a side of coleslaw. For $8.99 the entire wrap fit into the palm of my hand and side dishes were served in small ramekins plastic containers that I finished with 3 bites. My wife ordered the veggie burger with a side of jalapeno potato salad. Her normal sized burger dwarfed my wrap. The wrap needed more filling and more  of a side dish to make it worth $8.99."}
{"text":"Always fresh, always good. It takes a little longer to get food here than the norm, but worth it."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop for coffee in Boulder City. The espresso is way better than BCs Starbucks and there is never an insane line. Also excellent are the peanut butter cookies."}
{"text":"First time here so many choices to broasted chicken what I had with mac n cheese. They also have coffee / smoothies / milkshakes / and yogurt. Bbq pulled pork and sandwhiches and salads to choose from. Definitly coming back and taking family n friends....Customer service is on point....good job to the three ladies working the front."}
{"text":"You guys must check this cute place out! I was looking for ice cream and came across so much more! What a friendly, family oriented place, such a nice fun staff and the food was awesome! I wanted to eat everything ha but just got a few things! I'm definitely bringing all my friends here and can't wait for lake days in the spring/summer cause this will be our big stop for all our treats! Thanks again Chilli Jilli, love the new spot! Be back soon :)"}
{"text":"Freshly made Roasted chicken takes 15-20 minutes but it comes out fresh and hot. It was juicy with a good flavor. The potato wedges were delicious. The Mac-n-Cheese was just okay. Too much pepper and seasoning. If you like chili, their's was spicy and delicious. Overalll a nice stop to/from a visit to the Hoover Dam."}
{"text":"Quick stop for something to cool off with has the infamous dole whip that you usually only find at Disneyland :) On the plus side there are other flavors along with yogurt & custards."}
{"text":"Standard fro yo but have Dole Whip! Great smoothies would stop again Very nice outside seating."}
{"text":"This is one of the hidden jewels of Boulder City. Brunch on the patio every weekend is amazing! Breakfast enchiladas are our favorite- they are topped with carnitas that is super tender and flavorful. The dole mosas are awesome too. The atmosphere is relaxed and not too loud. The owners come out and chat with you a bit. High quality food and service that is family owned too!"}
{"text":"When I see \"We have dole whip\" I have to stop. I always drive by boulder city, I mean it is a five mile diversion on the way to vegas and on the way home. But not anymore. Their yogurt was pretty spot on for the flavor. The texture was off but its yogurt not soft serve (like Disneyland).   I ordered the 32oz dole whip float, the first thing they did was fill the cup full of the dole whip and then they poured dole pineapple juice on it. Finally, the cashier rang it up or at least tried to.  Cashier: its not on the register, but I know its on the menu, how about $5?   This was not a knock on her, I just like that she gave me a ton of dole whip frozen yogurt for $5.   I really liked this place for the atmosphere, and when I head back to vegas I hope to stop there again, though that maybe a few years from now..."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this spot. I swing by many afternoons on my way back to Vegas after training horses out in Boulder City; their drinks and frozen yogurt are the perfect refreshment after a day in the hot sun!  I usually go for the Dole whip- pineapple and raspberry swirled, topped with whipped cream is my personal favorite. I haven't had a chance to try the broasted chicken just yet, but it always looks and smells amazing.  I know this might seem silly, but I had to dock a star for one reason; one evening, I drove by around 9:15pm, noticed their open sign was on and stopped in for a drink; the girl working the drive-thru wasn't super polite when informing me they were closed for the evening. Since then, I frequently drive by after their closing time of 9PM, and the \"Open\" sign is always lit- please turn it off once you're closed, it's disappointing!"}
{"text":"OK place at best, the broasted chicken was okay, the coleslaw could have been a little sweeter, it was more like the coleslaw vegetables without the sauce.  I could see this place being an okay stop in the winter. The cons are 1. Non-existent AC in the place it was a hot sweaty wait. 2. Was the long wait 25-30 minute to get the food, which wouldn't have been so bad if they didn't try to save a few bucks by turning the AC off. It might be a good spot to pick up frozen yogurt or a shake, but the food wait seems too long."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dessert after having dinner in town. The staff is friendly and was patient with me while looking over the menu. This was my first time so I wasn't familiar with the menu and they have a lot of shaved ices, soft serve, salad, sandwiches and for all you Cali peeps they have Broaster chicken. The chicken even comes extra crispy cajun style! I will be back to check out the chicken. This visit I had a strawberry milkshake. Maybe it was even a malt since they have both the the menu, I really din't recall which I picked. It was thick and tasted pretty good. I like knowing about this place now because I have to travel to the area for work often and I can come back by and check it our for lunch and no doubt enjoy a sweet treat. Another plus is they have a drive thru which is very convenient."}
{"text":"Love Chilly Jillys Saturday and Sunday Patio Breakfast 8 am-1pm. Large seating area Great atmosphere- heaters for cooler mornings- 2 piece live band- relaxing music.  Don't miss stopping at this hidden gem on the highway. The Egg's Benedict was amazing and topped it off with a raspberry dolemosa. Several creative cocktails on the menu."}
{"text":"I love Chilly Jill'z, from the fresh salads to the beautiful pastry! Customer service is out of this world."}
{"text":"We were on vacation needed to get gas and grab a bite. Wow it was great. The ladies working were so nice and the food was tasty!!!!"}
{"text":"If you haven't had frozen dole whip before you have to go here! I recommend the dole whip float with pineapple-orange-banana juice. Their egg white and spinach breakfast crescent was also delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm sure you already know the lowdown about Dole Whip here, but did you know they also have broasted chicken? Who comes here for chicken? Apparently a lot of people! It's one of the more popular items ordered and they get a lot of customers from Vegas just for Broaster's Chicken according to the owner.   What's broasted chicken? Well here are the deets:  \"it's a different method of cooking chicken, pressure cooked, it's more moist and less greasy than fried chicken\" ..that's how it was explained to us by the owner.  The verdict:  I was skeptical at first but now I'm a fan of broasted chicken. It's pretty good! It is moist and juicy, the skin is slightly crisp. The flavor goes down right down to the bone, like it's been brined. Nice! Biggest appeal, NOT GREASY AT ALL!     Added bonus are the health benefits...less calories, less carbs, less fat, Im  so down for that!  They have individual meal deals, family packs with sides (mac&cheese, potato salad, mixed greens) and/or you can order chicken 8-20 pieces.  Be mindful that chicken is cooked to order.  We were told 15 min wait for ours. No worries! I'd much rather wait a few more minutes than have chicken that's been sitting under heat lamps you know?  You can call ahead your order and pick it up at their drive thru. How convenient!  We just ordered ours though to-go and had our Dole Whip while we waited.   Since our chicken was a to-go order it was packaged in a thick cardboard box. It still held well and retained heat when we got home.   Prices are slightly high, especially if you are getting that 20 meal deal. Then again I cant speak or compare prices to the popular fried chicken franchises since I haven't stepped foot in them in last fifteen plus years.    As for the bakery cafe itself, it's been expanded since October, bright, clean, plenty of room, the dining area has a few tables and chairs. The kitchen where they prepare everything looked clean and organized and pretty big too.  Heads Up! The stand where they were originally at is now a hot dog stand run by Chilly Jilly'z it just opened!    Staff and service was great. Everyone was helpful and friendly.  Even when some customer was whining about how long their corn dog was taking to cook, they were more than apologetic and respectful to that person than I would've been. Sheesh people!  So when making the rounds in BC last stop back to Hendo is here for Dole Whip and Broaster's Chicken."}
{"text":"Thank you, Nelson Q, for checking in here! I had a good share of cold summer treats this year and I was so happy to find Chilly Jilly'z!  What did I find here?   Dole Whip from Hawaii! Assorted flavors: the infamous pineapple, orange, raspberry, even chocolate! 39 cents per ounce. Ask for sample cups if you want to try any. Pour what you want, pay, and enjoy this refreshing treat! They also have a few frozen yogurt flavors they seem to rotate. At one point, they had Sea Salt Caramel Pretzel. SO GOOD! When they ran out of that one, I was like \"NOOOO!!!\" Last trip there, they had Apple Pie. Very yummy!  Chilly Jilly'z has homemade pastries always on display. Also, I usually see a good people in line to order sandwiches, salads, and coffee, but I haven't tried them.   The girls behind the counter have always been friendly, even when they're very busy. The restrooms are clean.  If you're driving to Boulder City from Henderson, Chilly Jilly'z is the first building you will see on the left side off the 95.   Yes, fellow Yelpers. It's far away. Make a pit stop if you're ever nearby. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! They have something for everyone! Including the best sugar free shaved ice that we've tasted! You will not regret dropping by. Oh and do yourself a favor and break diet for their oatmeal sandwich cookie. Oh em gee! The best! It's a local and tourist favorite for a reason."}
{"text":"Really good food. I usually get a turkey sandwich. Always good. My favorite thing though is the jalapeño potato salad. I love it!"}
{"text":"We drive by this place and finally stopped last week.  We had the dole Pineapple whip and french fries.. Both were fresh, yummy and affordable.  Love the name and I am glad we stopped.. It's very roomy inside.. and they have a nice menu too."}
{"text":"LOVED this place!! We stopped on our way from Vegas to Hoover Dam and fell in love. We are mega coffee drinkers and were so impressed! I got a peanut butter, chocolate frap and it was amazing! We are still talking about it months later. The yogurt is great too! She had soy AND almond milk for my vegan friend, so she was excited! The lady working there was awesome, fun, and excited about the product, which made us love it more!"}
{"text":"On our way to Grand Canyon we were looking for a good latte and found an awesome one here! And a funky spot with great staff as well! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Great frozen yogurt flavors, and frozen custard too!  Orange and pineapple swirled together is like a tropical 50-50 bar!  Very friendly staff is a bonus."}
{"text":"Best food in BC/Henderson area...never a bad experience...ALWAYS great food!!! Also the best coffee around.. Love Chilly Jilly's..my goto place when out n hungry!"}
{"text":"One of the few places to get a Dole Whip Float on the mainland without paying a Disney admission fee- along with Broaster Chicken. Didn't know what that was until I ordered it, and it's a really good fried chicken that is super juicy and flavorful.  Dole Whip, if you haven't had it, is essentially a pineapple rootbeer float- pineapple soft serve in pineapple juice. Sweet but a bit tart, very refreshing. Goes well with the chicken they sell. Menu also has other typical salads and sandwiches, as well as coffee drinks and smoothies. Bonus points for having a drive-thru!  Service was polite but slow- gave us a warning our chicken would be a 10 minute wait, which is not a big deal because fresh food is good, right? But we were the only customers and by the time we left, 45 minutes later, there were four people still waiting for orders- no one had been served but us."}
{"text":"We had planned to visit to Laughlin for a couple of days during a stay in Vegas, so I researched eating places on route and found Chilly Jilly'z.  Located about 20 minutes outside was the perfect place, as we called ahead so our chicken was hot & ready when we arrived (their chicken is made to order about 20 minutes wait).  Their broasted chicken was good crispy, savory, juicy and flavorful.  The wedges were good too.  We ordered an 8 piece dark meat and potato wedges.  The owner was nice and came to chat with us while we ate.  And with all the good places to eat in Vegas we returned to Chilly Jilly'z on the way back from Laughlin.  That was a no brainer.   Can't wait for my next vacation.  I've tried chicken at M&M soul food and Hash House a Go-Go and I like this chicken better.  Hawaii guy in Vegas"}
{"text":"I got duped by the Jillster! I was cruising through Boulder city after an awesome hike and was looking for a little spot to grab a bite and saw this place at the edge of town with a drive thru and I thought, perfect! It has an inviting old comforting look to it that screams : great food!        Alas.. Not so great.. Got the TABLT  (turkey avocado bacon lettuce tomato)  and a chocolate peanut butter malt.. Waited about 10 minutes for it in the drive thru.. Which is fine and really just strengthened my assumption that it was gonna be awesome!.. First bite... Wah wah waaaaaaah.. Not so good.. Average quality ingredients with a bland preparation.. Just wasn't good in any way really.. Upon inspection... And the choc pb malt was on par with the sandwich.. Too thin as in after 5 minutes in the car (in December mind you) there was barely any shake consistency left to it and just melted shake.. Flavor was too sweet with gobs of chocolate sauce.. The peanut butter was barely noticeable and I tasted zero malt.. The only thing that was not too bad was the jalapeño potato salad.. Which was actually spicy (hooray!) I would probably have bumped this place up a star but it just LOOKS like it should be better than it was.. And for that I felt a little cheated.. Not cool Jilly.."}
{"text":"Jill is the BOMB!! This place is my favorite. The breakfast sandwich croissant is amazing"}
{"text":"So I may need to update this review later on but this review is based off of what I ordered recently. I've always had my eyes set on Chilly Jillyz. Every time I come in this beck of the woods and drive by I was always wanting to stop but never have. This Memorial Day I did it and it was worth it.   I walked in not knowing what to expect and to my surprise there was more food then I thought. The sweet treat case stares right at you as soon as you walk in and your mouth instantly water. They had all kinds of dessert waiting to be enjoyed. From Brownies to Blondies they all look so yummy and made in house.   I left without ordering anything but automatically regretted it so I went through the oh so cute drive thru. I order no food but a Peanut Butter chocolate bar and a Chocolate Malt with whip cream.   The bar came and it was ok the size was great but the peanut butter was l grainy and the chocolate was not sweet at all taste kind of like chewing on oily greasy mouth full of lard. 1/5 it looked amazing but fell short.   Then the Malt came out and we were mind blown. OMG that alone gets a 10/5 it was the best I mean THE BEST Chocolate malts I've had. If I can not find anywhere in Town that serves up a Malt like this I will definitely drive out for this. It was creamy it was malty it was YUMMY! I have to come back and try their food menu everything sound so good and I can't wait!!!"}
{"text":"An outstanding breakfast place to eat at in Boulder City, NV. !!  Live (& great) Jazz music on Sundays This place has no competition as far as breakfast (and really other meals as well) that I have tired in the area.  A Michelin Star of sorts.  If there was an 8 star ranking, this place would get that rating!!  The staff is very attentive, friendly and customer service oriented!!  Plenty of parking as well.  The ownership has done well to offer us this hidden gem!!  Keep up the great work.  If you haven't eaten at Chilly Jilly'z...well you are truly missing out..."}
{"text":"Came here today and used the drive thru after a nice hike. I got a small Dole Whip for my son and the Tropical Thunder smoothie without banana for myself. I can't comment on the Dole Whip outside of the fact that my son had inhaled it before we made it home and my smoothie was perfect! It wasn't too sweet like I thought it would be. The girl at the drive thru was ultra friendly and has lovely eyebrows. Will be coming here again after our next hike."}
{"text":"This place is great. Yogurt, coffee, milkshakes, Dole whip and Italian soda. Large restaurant and perfect for after hike hydration, when you're in the area. I should've tried out the salads. I saw them making them fresh and they were huge and looked delicious. The chicken smelled great, too. Wish they had refillable soda machine, but can't find much else to complain about here."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times for the weekend breakfast on the patio. The outside patio is comfortable and clean. The music from the speakers was loud one morning and we were the only folks there, but they said they couldn't turn it down which makes it a little difficult when trying to communicate with seniors who were our guests. Heaters at each table (though they said ours wasn't working on a cool morning we were there), wall block any wind, and covered to block the sun. Servers are all on top of their game and keep the drinks refilled plus the kitchen staff seem to always hit a home run with everything including the breakfast sandwich, chicken and waffle and chicken fried steak. Potatoes included with breakfast are fresh not frozen. Baked goods (desserts) from the bakery are outstanding and had some very good and not loud jazz musicians on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Great frozen yogurt selection, lots of pastries, sandwiches. Cute atmosphere and has a big screen tv."}
{"text":"We loved eating at Chilly Jillys! The people working there were so nice and knowledgable on their menu. The sandwich, TABLT, was delicious!!! They were so sweet, one of the ladies follow us out and gave my son some gummy bears. So nice! Thanks guys!!! :)"}
{"text":"The Skinny: two words: dole whip. 'Nuff said (4) service: counter service - your standard (3) value: considering that it is the only place that serves dole whip in the Las Vegas area (as far as I know) and saves you a trip to Disneyland, I'd give it a 4.  There are a few things that I get obsessed with...the hubs, hiking gear, a good read and tastes of my childhood. Dole whip fits in the latter category.  Ah dole whip! I remember ever summer going to our local fair and it would be there. Don't forget the family trips to Disney - Dole whip and smoked turkey leg stops were a must!  So when I found out that Chilly Jilly'z had Dole Whip, I was all ready to go to Boulder City just to get a taste. So we came after a nice hike in the Lake Mead area.  First of all, I had no idea that Dole whip came in so many flavors - vanilla, orange, raspberry? That blew my mind! Of course I had to try them all! At 39 cents per oz, it is a wee bit pricey but if it saves me a trip to Disneyland/Hawaii to get my Dole Whip fix - bring it on!  I didn't have a chance to try the broasted chicken or anything else however that may be something to try the next time we visit.  For the fact that they have Dole Whip in four different flavors, this place gets 4 stars."}
{"text":"Made two trips here this week. Love the service that was provided. Love their spinach turnovers and love their mocha frappes. Love, love, love!!"}
{"text":"My family stopped by after Las Vegas. The dole whip was pretty good and the fried chicken was delicious! A must try! The people was extremely kind and patient with our orders. When our chicken was ready it came out hot and tender. The dole whip was pretty good but a bit sweet. A great Instagram picture to post :) it came with a cherry and a cute umbrella on top and whip cream. You need to mix the dole whip so you don't drink straight pineapple juice. This place may look little but it's worth the stop. They have many selections from sandwiches, frozen custard, frozen yogurt, dole whip, chicken, etc."}
{"text":"Dole Whip! The stuff childhood memories are made of. It's especially great since my daughter has food allergies, she can actually enjoy a treat every now and then since these are gluten/lactose free. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"I had to add one more star for only one reason: dole whip. It's the only place I know of near me that has it and when I'm having a big craving I have stopped in to get one. So if you are just getting self serve yogurt or whip it's not a bad stop. Would t recommend eating here unless you have a ton of time."}
{"text":"Adorable! I have driven by this place many times when taking visiting friends to the Hoover Dam, and always wanted to stop in. Thankfully I did! Upon entering, you immediately get that this restaurant is charming and has to be a local hangout! The lady behind the counter was helpful and welcoming. My friend and I both got the Big Horn Sandwich and a drink, with slight variations of condiments and side orders. They made the sandwiches correctly and they were delicious! Perfect lunch size! The Mac and cheese was delicious and the tater tots were crisp to perfection! We were both full, and not able to partake in dessert, but I chatted with some other patrons that said the orange/pineapple whip is where it's at! Can't wait to go back and try it... forget the Hoover Dam, might make the drive from Vegas just give Chilly Jillys another visit!"}
{"text":"Breakfast \"hotpocket\" was raw,  ice cold and dripping with grease.  Waited 45 minutes for that and 2 drinks and all the employees wanted to do was stand around and talk"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I were around the area because of a Hoover Dam tour. We had stopped in front of a notoriously bad pizza joint and decided to walk a few extra feet and come here instead! So so soooooo glad we did :D  When we came in the staff greeted us immediately. We ended up ordering the 4 piece fried chicken with Mac and cheese, potato salad, potato wedges and two biscuits. On top of this we also ordered the Dole special drink.   Fried chicken was awesome, perfectly cooked, crispy and juicy! It takes them 15-20 minutes to make this after you order so hang tight.  Mac and cheese was good but was a bit dry. I think it's just a preference thing.  Potato salad was too hard. The potatos were  undercooked and although the seasoning was good, we were unable to eat this.  Potato wedges were the perfect consistency but needed additional seasoning so we just added some salt and pepper, no biggy :)  Biscuits were yummy, make sure to add some of the provided butter and honey!  Signature Dole whip float was refreshing and felt healthy lol  When we visit Vegas again, this will definitely be one of the spots I have to hit up."}
{"text":"Recently expanded from their Kiosk across the street Chilly Jillyz now offers a full menu and not just great breakfast items, pastries, etc, but also great sandwiches, chicken, smoothies, frozen yogurt, etc etc etc. I stopped in for my favorite, the breakfast turnover, absolute heaven. Last week I tried the pork loin sandwich, it exceeded all expectations, tender, moist, thinly sliced on your choice of bread. Jillyz has really raised the bar in boulder city. And did I mention the really great staff? They lift your day with excellent service and cheerful attitudes!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  They do a brisk breakfast business - but we stopped in for lunch.   There is a surprisingly large menu and and I was tempted by many choices.  The fried chicken was amazingly delicious and the potato wedges were very flavorful."}
{"text":"This place apparently is known for their Pinneapple dole whip drink or what not. I love the Pinneapple treats at Disneyland, so we decided to give it a try.   Just saw this place on yelp, took a drive out there from Mountain's Edge  (About a 30-40 min drive). We get there order their Pinneapple Dole whip drink and the cashier continues by saying : We are out of Pinneaple dole whip but you are more than welcome to the other flavors. NO....you are known because of the Pinneaple not the other flavors. What a waste of time and gas."}
{"text":"Best broasted chicken! Amazing customer service! Totally worth the drive!   The chicken is perfect! It's tender and juicy!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! If you're ever driving through, definitely stop in for a snack or even a full meal. Everyone there is so nice and friendly. Nothing beats getting a dole whip and enjoying the desert landscape.  Clean place with good everything!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this place after our Hoover Dam Tour. My guy tried the red velvet chocolate covered cake. WOW it was good and I hate red velvet.  His milkshake was good as well.  My cappuccino was very good.   We found the staff friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"ALL THE DOLE WHIP YOU CAN ADD TO A CUP!  Enough said.  Sandwiches, smoothies, are some other things they offer. I did the twist of all dole whip flavors, derliscious!  You also pay depending on ounce, classic frozen yogurt place.  When in Boulder, get your butt to Chilly Jilly'z (it will most likely be hot as Hades so you might as well try to cool yourself down)"}
{"text":"Went here because of the Broasters chicken. After the girls at the counter took our order we waited approximately an hour to receive our food INCLUDING THE DRINKS. The food was inedible and gross. I went back to the counter to ask for water cups and a side of ranch and they ignored my ranch request once I had told them I had already paid on my ticket. Food was not worth it here nor the service. Man oh man I guess I was happy with the price"}
{"text":"My Dole Whip float was delicious.  The employees were friendly.  The dining room was clean.  We'll be back next time we're in Boulder City."}
{"text":"Dole Whip floats! Sparkling clean restrooms!  Impeccable service!  We've driven all the way from NW vegas twice now just to go here. Make the trip, it's worth it, I promise!  :)"}
{"text":"My family and I always pass by this place when we drive through Boulder City to get to Arizona, but haven't ever stopped by until this past weekend. The Dole Whip was just calling my name!   I'm a HUGE fan of Dole Whip and it's a must whenever I go to Disneyland! Y'all don't know how excited I was when I saw the sign out front that said they served Dole Whip! Thank God for Chilly Jilly'z because their Dole Whip tastes just as good, if not better than Disneyland! Best part? I don't have to fork over an arm and a leg to get my fix! The Dole Whip is self-serve along with other flavors of frozen yogurt, and is also offered in the form of a Dole Whip Float! I'll definitely have to try one next time we're passing through!   Chilly Jilly'z also serves a variety of food items. They serve burgers, chicken, sandwiches, and even salads! The food we ordered was decent, nothing out of the ordinary. We enjoyed our lunch out front on the patio since we had our pup with us. The service was great and we'll definitely be back soon for more Dole Whip!"}
{"text":"Took my kids here after hiking on a Sunday. Food wasn't great and the staff was rude. They lost my ticket and forgot my order. After I went up to the counter to inquire about it they were still very rude. I won't be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went for lunch after visiting the dam. What a surprise! The staff was so friendly & helpful: the food was outstanding, & the place was cute & spotless. Would highly recommend going."}
{"text":"Best place ever!!! Food is great! You can get the pineapple dole whip here, the only other place I have ever been able to get it is Disneyland!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on our drive to Las Vegas and, yeah, this is as good as it gets.  Broasted chicken and potato wedges were cooked to perfection.  Crispy, juicy chicken cooked just right.  Potato wedges were crispy when you bite into them with soft insides.  Didn't care for the cole slaw or potato salad, but everything else was so good, it still gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great place to eat when visiting Hoover Dam!  Clean refreshing food awesome smoothies!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and delicious treats is what this place is all about.   After a visit on the holiday Santa Train/model train museum nearby, a pineapple dole whip float hit just the spot.   Orange juice, pineapple soft-serve, whip cream--YUM!     My kids had their own bowls of frozen yogurt.   It's fairly similar to the many yogurt spots located across the valley.  Price is by the ounce, toppings include all your favorite cereals, popping boba, candies, and more.    If you've got quite an appetite, salads, sandwiches, and fried chicken is also served here.  I'll make an update once I give these a try.     You also get a 10% discount if you show your santa train tickets.   The place is clean.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.   This is a good spot to stop by after a day trip to Boulder City."}
{"text":"I was in Boulder City for a business trip, and was introduced to Chilly Jilly'z. On my last night, I ordered a TABLT with a spicy potato salad and it was DELICIOUS!!! I've been to Hoover Damn hundreds of times over the past year due to family visitors and have always drove past it, but from now, I will be stopping by. Hell, I might be stopping by once a month just to get good food. It is nice to see old style restaurant that  makes food as they are ordered.  I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"A Dole whip float on your way to the Hoover Dam??? What in the world is going on?? I don't care, my heart was just so happy to stumble upon this frozen treat gem and not have to be at the happiest place on earth to get one of the yummiest treats i know in the dead of Nevada summer.  Of course everything is just a little better at Disneyland, but this pineapple Dole whip float sure was delicious and super refreshing.   This place was pretty cute, too. Little bit of the 50s cafe vibe to it. They also have self-serve frozen yogurt (Dole pineapple is available for self-serve) & they serve food, corn dogs, sandwiches, burgers, cool little spot.  They also have baked goods and I bought some cookie/brownie fusion deliciousness but forgot.what it was called haha.  Bottom line, on your way to the Dam or near the area, stop by!"}
{"text":"Omg...dole whip floats is all I can say!  No need to go to Disneyland for dole whip anymore. Although, I love Disneyland so I'll still use that excuse.  Prices are very reasonable and they have other desserts and flavored coffees as well.   Too bad it's in boulder city though cause we only head out there once or twice a year."}
{"text":"Got invited by family for breakfast. The service was quick and our waitress was very friendly an accurate with our order. Food was good, portions were bigger then expected. You can order off the menu. My husband wanted a cheeseburger with fries and they made it happen at 9am."}
{"text":"They have the best chicken in all of Vegas! The service is way better than you would expect! Dang, gott get back there asap"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went here last Sunday and it was terrible service. I have been in this industry over 20 years and they need more help. We stood at the front of the patio for at least 7 minutes and 4 people walked by and said be right with you . When we finally got sat we waited and no one came over to get our drink order for a good 5 minutes. The worst part was the party of 5 and the party of 3 that were behind us in line for sat right after us and waited on immediately. Someone came over took our drink order and I watched that party of 5 and 3 get their drink order taken and food order taken and we still had not gotten our drinks. By this time we had been there about 20 minutes so we got up and walked out. Terrible way to run a business."}
{"text":"Any time you are in the Boulder City area, I highly recommend making a stop here for either breakfast, lunch or dinner. Located just right off the main highway on your left if you are heading to Hoover Dam. Hours are 6 am to 8 pm.  On a nice 80 degree May saturday, me and the wifey stopped off here for lunch. Since I always seem to notice my good Yelp friend Shirley B checking in here I knew that it was worth a look.  Two things sparked my interest here. The Broasted Chicken and for my wife, the Dole Whip frozen yogurt.  For those that never heard of broasting, it is a process of deep frying in a pressure cooker, which results in a crispy outside while sealing the natural juices inside. This makes the chicken less greasy. My wife sarcastically said that it was a couple of brothers roasting chickens. God I love her.  I got the 2 piece meal deal ($8.99) which is a wing and a breast, potato wedges, a biscuit, and side in which I chose mac n cheese. The chicken is superb. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The potato wedges were more like cut up quarters of a potato, fried, and sprinkled with some kind of cajun seasoning. The mac n cheese was standard and was sprinkled with a bit of ground pepper. The biscuit tasted similar to KFC's. Doesnt come with a drink so I ordered a medium fountain drink for a couple bucks more. They serve coke products.  As for the Dole Whip (39 cents per oz), was as good as you what you would get at Disneyland for it is the very same thing. They have a toppings bar that you can put on your frozen yogurt similar to other fro yo places. I tried it and it WAS just like Disneyland. Had some sweetness to it while at the same time a bit of tart.  Service was simple and decent. You order at the counter and they bring it out to you. Just remember that whatever you order that they make it from scratch so make sure you have plenty of time to enjoy you food here if dining in.  Overall I will make this place a regular stop any time im in Boulder City for their hours are great and their menu is versatile meaning you can order sandwiches, milkshakes, smoothies, shaved ice, hot dogs, coffee, and gourmet drinks. The chicken itself is a main headliner for me.  Yelp 2015 review #21 519 overall"}
{"text":"This place has great atmosphere, cheerful people and tasty food. When ever you happen to be in Boulder City, this is a must stop place."}
{"text":"Great lunch! I had a tuna sandwich with provolone cheese, slightly grilled on the panini press with the house-made potato salad. Very tasty! I would definitely go here again - I want to try the pulled chicken BBQ sandwich next :D Oh yeah - I also had an iced Americano which was excellent. I was not disappointed and only wish I lived nearer so I could visit more often. Until next time!"}
{"text":"So let me first say that we ate at another joint just down the street but stopped in cuz they had dessert... obviously from the name of the shop... BUT they had food as well! Well my eyes read 'Best Dam Panini' and I'm like oh really (I'm a sucker for that) I like to know and experience this best Dam Panini for myself... so we ordered take out.. O.M.G. Best. Decision. I've. Ever.  Made. It really was the best Dam Panini of ever had... it makes me soo sad that it's only there in AZ... can you please open up shop here in LA?! I may be willing to drive there next time I'm in Vegas. You folks who live near this place... blessed, truly blessed"}
{"text":"GROSS!!! I had the chicken and it was a sad disappointment.  The chicken was bland and rubbery. I also had the mac & cheese and it just tasted like melted macaroni, no flavor and barely any cheese. The jalapeño slaw or whatever it was,  was absolutely disgusting and the potato wedges were made with dangerous green potatoes.  YOU'VE BEEN WARNED."}
{"text":"After an afternoon of checking out the Hoover Dam and biking in Bootleg Canyon stopped by this cool little local eatery and had a delicious chicken salad samich on whole grain bread. Paninis looked tempting but I was craving a cold samich. Hit the spot. Next time I swing by with the kids and get ice cream floats..."}
{"text":"Great place to stop by if you are in the area.  Friendly staff and lots of selections on sweets and baked goods.  I always get the broasted chicken and have never been disappointed by it."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly this was really delicious! We were on our way home from Hoover Dam and happened to stumble upon Chilly Jilly'z. We were a little hesitant but the drive-thru drew us in since we wanted something quick and easy to get back on the road.  The fried chicken's skin was thin and crispy! Very tender and juicy! It was a 10 minute wait when ordering the chicken because they make it to order. Had the dole whip and that tasted just as good as the ones in Hawaii! just the right amount of tartness. They even put a mini umbrella that was cute :P Also ordered the peanut butter/espresso freeze and that was also delicious!   Definitely would recommend this place if you are ever in the area."}
{"text":"Ah memories....I haven't had Dole Whip since I went to Disney world as a kid and it is so nice to be able to have it again.  Especially without having to trek to one of the Magic Kingdom properties.  What is even cooler is that Dole Whip fruit favors are vegan!  Finally some kind of ice cream like product, in Boulder City, that I can enjoy.  Bonus is that the coffee is great too."}
{"text":"Great \"lil joint\" in Boulder City, NV. Easy to find... right on the main highway as you enter/exit the city on your way to/from Henderson. Lots of parking but they do have a drive-thru window if you need it \"to go\" and don't want to get outta your car. They also have patio seating which is nice when the weather is good but since you are right on the highway this might not be ideal when there's lots of traffic.  Or maybe it is so you can watch the cars go by. LOL!  I enjoyed the Best Dam Panini which was kinda like a Reuben sandwich... but with Tri Tip and a bit of BBQ sauce with the coleslaw. You have a couple choices for a side... I selected the regular potato salad.  The potato salad was fresh and homemade tasting but pretty bland IMO.  I wouldn't order it again as a side.  The Tri Tip was tender and the coleslaw and bbq sauce were a great touch of sweet and tangy and crunchy all in one bite.  Anyways... I ate half my panini, and took the other half home for lunch the next day.  It's not a big sandwich and I could have easily eaten it in one sitting but I also decided on trying the Pineapple/Orange \"Dole Whip\" so I was saving myself. The Dole Whip did not disappoint.  Of course, I had not had it before here or D-land or anywhere else, so I had no point of reference only that a lot of folks rave about it.  I REALLY LIKED IT!  I'd totally get it again.    The soft serve is serve-yourself.  But be VERY CAREFUL... as it is easy to get carried away with the amount you put in your cup and before you know it, you've served yourself a $10 dessert.  Go easy on the toppings too since  they add up fast.  So... my Panini, iced tea and Dole Whip brought my total to $15 for the afternoon.  Not cheap, but I enjoyed the experience and had a lovely lunch with a friend I hadn't seen in a while so I thought it was well worth it."}
{"text":"Yeah, right, this chicken is not fried? ARE YOU SURE? Yes, that it what I was asking the cashier because it was crispy, and juicy, and looked and tasted like fried chicken. Just without the fried. Its BROASTED. I am not sure of the exact meaning, but to me the meaning is, secrectly fried chicken that is better for you than normal fried chicken.  AND they have malts, shakes, a self serve yogurt bar, sandwiches, and of course the ever so famous Dole whip.  I personally enjoy taking a day trip to Boulder City and enjoying the scenery. However, if that is not your thing, this place is on the outskirts and you do not need to go into the town. They also have a drive-thru. But be patient because they cook everything fresh to order. It is worth the wait.  A small hole in the wall, that literally moved from a shack across the street to a full building. Clearly they are doing something right.  BC has a lot of hidden gems, don't skip this one, you will regret it!"}
{"text":"Great frozen yogurt location and lots of lunch items like salads, sandwiches, soups, chili or and desserts ready or prepared in the kitchen.  The staff is friendly and lots of indoor or outdoor seating or even a drive through if you are in s hurry!"}
{"text":"This place is lovely!  The broasted chicken is moist & delicious.  The sandwiches and salads are superb.  Don't forget to save room for frozen yogurt!  We bike over from Hendo with a big group of kids and the service has always been friendly."}
{"text":"Very reminiscent of the drive-ins that dot coastal New England, albeit without the seafood, Chilly Jilly'z diverse menu still has something to please everyone.  From fresh baked breads and pastries, to their savory sirloin turnovers, delicious home-made sandwiches, signature \"Broaster\" chicken, and quite an array of cold treats, there's a reason why locals love it here!  My personal favorite so far is their \"Best Dam Panini\" which is sirloin shaved thin, served with slaw, provolone, mayo and mustard on a ciabatta is hands down the best I've had in Vegas. My goal is to try everything on the menu at least once; this place is that good."}
{"text":"Great tasting breakfast, plenlty to eat, casual service, friendly. I highly recommend, second time on the patio. Patio only open Saturday, Sunday."}
{"text":"Chilly Jilly'z is my go to spot after hiking out in the Boulder City area.  A Dole Whip Float is so refreshing and adds to the hiking day fun.  It is such fun place that has all kinds of goodies.  We have tried their baked goods and they are just a delicious as the Dole Whip Floats.  A recent standout was the Almond Joy cookie which was amazing.      The inside reminds me of a 50's diner and that fits with the cool old cars and trucks that the owner parks outside.  The dining area is always clean and inviting.  The service is always friendly and helpful.  I would say avoid the drive through which can be really slow.      The Dole Whip is why I stop here and it is everything I want it to be.  It brings back the fond memories of Disneyland when they were one of the only places to get it and the Dole Plantation in Hawaii.  After a long Hike there is nothing that I crave more than their Dole Whip Float.     This great small business and is a must stop if in the area.  They have so much to offer whether it is a refreshing Dole Whip, unique yogurt flavors, baked goodies or a plate lunch or dinner.  I am already planning my next hike and ensuring that a Dole Whip is a part of the day!"}
{"text":"Best Chocolate Peanut Butter malt I've ever had. My wife, when visiting Disneyland, goes straight for the Dole stand for the Dole Whip Pineapple Float. She says the same float here at Chilly's are on par if not better than Disneyland!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great breakfast hosted by a fantastic owner and wait staff don't hesitate to stop In here at the Patio! Jill and crew are personable and fun, prices are great, portions are big. Sunday live Jazz at 9 is smooth and on point.   Step away from the strip, head to Boulder City and enjoy a great kick off to your day!   Thumbs Up!"}
{"text":"Well the coffee is excellent the service is excellent well I will have to say the broasted chicken is not that good very tough and dried out"}
{"text":"Slooooowwwww!! We were the only customers in there and it took forever to get our food. The little girls behind the counter are snot nose brats. The frozen yogurt is good, but that's because the brats behind the counter couldn't mess it up. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The broaster chicken is good. We ordered the 8 piece meal.  My favorite were the small pieces. It came with wedge potatoes and biscuits. The wedge potatoes are huge and heavily seasoned. Ordered a side of  potato salad that was clearly homemade and delicious. The restaurant itself is very vibrant and inviting. There is indoor and outdoor seating. Look forward to trying more from their menu."}
{"text":"We are here for the breakfast on the Patio. This is a good place to sit outside since there's only tables outside.  Nice and cool with fans and misters and cover. The bread is homemade here so you need to have toast or French toast. I had an omelet last time and my husband had chicken and waffles. Both were okay. The next time we tried the French toast and pancakes and home fries and hash browns. These were great choices. I believe the cinnamon French toast was a special maybe not here all the time but worth asking. So the next time we went in I had the veggie eggs Benedict. And my husband had the chicken fried steak.   He said it was great, I didn't try. My veggie bene was floating in holindaise. I liked the flavor maybe the confirmation needs work because the sauce was Mostly underneath the muffins and my home fries. The egg was hard boiled. The coffee here is wonderful and so is the staff and service. Now they have love music on Sunday's that actually is delightful.  Great hospitality here of course we will come back!"}
{"text":"I originally came here for the Dole Whip but their menu is amazing! We've only tried the fried chicken, potato wedges, Mac and cheese, biscuits and some pastries and I wouldn't change a single thing! Unbelievable food and fabulous customer service! The staff is super friendly have great chemistry together. Can't wait to go back and try their other items =D"}
{"text":"After moving to Boulder City in October I was going batty trying to wade through the line at Starbucks each morning before work, so one day on the way to church (I couldn't risk a bad coffee on the way to work!), I decided to stop in and give it a try. So happy I did. Now instead of waiting 20 minutes for a mediocre coffee I hit the drive thru and have a great cup of coffee in less than 5 minutes. The staff is awesome, I think I might have to try the broasted chicken tonight."}
{"text":"Here's the dealio on Chilly Jillyz yo!  The burger was really good, fresh, generous.  Fries did their job.  Salad was also generous.  The TABLT was decent, ingredients were fresh, turkey was real (not the compact slices you find at other places) ... and since it was real it was slightly dry but hey, it was turkey.  I'd definitely go back for a burger."}
{"text":"We shared a broaster chicken meal and I'm sure glad we did!! There was so much food and it was all very tasty. We came here Thursday afternoon following our visit to Lake Mead and Hoover Dam. Jill was very kind and I overheard her in a catering consultation and I was very impressed. She definitely knows her stuff!! If I were ever to get married in Vegas I would definitely have Chilly Jilly'z as my caterer!"}
{"text":"Yum. I love this place. Get a doll whip. The food is really good and fresh. I love broasted chicken. Really worth it after seeing the Hoover damn"}
{"text":"Well chilly Jilly's you've done it again....we are hooked! We are definitely glad we found this place as we travel to go fishing frequently and this is such a little gem on the way. My daughter and I decided the raspberry Dole Whip is definitely our favorite.  Where else can you get fried chicken a salad and a pineapple Dole Whip in a Drive-Thru?! Want to go inside and relax there's an outside patio in addition to a cute indoor setup full of magical sugary treats and some light items for lunch and breakfast.  Lots of cute and sporty classic cars in the front make this a great place to people-watch and see all the traffic driving by in a mad rush to get to and from Las Vegas from Arizona.  The staff was nice as they let our daughter try lots of the flavors before purchasing. You can get 10% off your entire purchase with Yelp check-in.  There is also a cute place next door called The Patio where you can have breakfast and cocktails and also eat outside.  We will continue to make this our brief stop between Nevada and Arizona for a little bit of sugary goodness. What a cute little place and it definitely represents the small-town feel of Boulder City."}
{"text":"Best coffee for my early mornings before work or on my way to Lake Mead. Caramel latte is my favorite. I also like grabbing an Italian soda after work sometimes. Having a drive-thru makes my life so easy. I've tried almost every sandwich and the girls love the ice cream. Broasted chicken is so much better than fried or any other way for that matter. Super friendly staff and they even made us lunch to go once in the early morning. I love this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful place, even had healthy items!  I had the green smoothie, low sugar.  And a fabulous croissant.   Coming back this eve for a veggie burger Reuben, which I will ask to have made special."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee made local right in Boulder City! The Dole soft serve mango/pineapple/orange juice floats with whipped cream are out of this world."}
{"text":"Everything here is Amazing ! Awesome food, great customer service, very friendly staff! Great atmosphere! Definitely 5 stars  Chilly Jillyz  is amazing too! The Patio Rocks!!!"}
{"text":"Meh. Not impressed. Food was okay, prices were a bit much. Staff was friendly but not enough to overcome the prices."}
{"text":"After a long day in and around Boulder City, we made a visit to Chilly Jilly's our last stop. I got a small dole whip float which I loved. The combo of Dole soft serve and orange juice was a perfect way to cool off from the summer heat."}
{"text":"This is a nice stop for a sweet treat. You can go inside or they have a drive-thru. The girl at the register was friendly and helpful with the going over the menu and their popular items. I had a \"Dole Whip Float\" priced at $4.50 for a medium. It soft-serve pineapple with pineapple juice and whip cream. Yum! If you are a pineapple lover then this is for you! It was a nice treat and I will try the next one with orange juice instead just to see what it is like. They have other items on the menu like broaster chicken, sandwiches, salads, coffee and a kids menu. I have found a new stop on my way back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FIND!!! We stopped in mid-afternoon after our visit to the Hoover Dam. Thought it was an ice cream place, but oh boy, it is SO MUCH MORE than that!!! First impression ~ sparkling clean, inviting decor (just LOVED the outdoor seating under the terrace) & the staff ~ warm, friendly, all with a smile & genuine interest in taking care of us!  It was 110 degrees & we were all a bit in need of a \"retreat\" & this place did the trick! Our only regret was that we only had room for ice cream ~ 4 of us had \"make your own\" sundaes, 2 had Mocha Frappes.  The \"make your own\" bar was FANTASTIC ~ you dream it, I bet they have it! My 2 teenagers were in HEAVEN!! The Mocha Frappe was REAL & the most delicious ever ~ we even got to choose our milk (almond for me)!   We drooled over the menu ~ in particular, I'd drive back to try the Dam Panini alone... but (sigh...), it's a long way from New Hampshire  Thank you, Chilly Jilly'z for being our Oasis yesterday ~ keep up the GREAT work!"}
{"text":"Came here after going to a hoover dam tour that had suggested vinny's pizza.  Coming to chilly jillys I was immediately greeted with smiles.   I looked at some photos by other yelpers and can attest the, best dam panini is here! I had never had something so succinct and flavorful yet also so meaty.  I had also tried the hot pastrami which was also delicious, my only regret is that I didn't try the frozen yogurt.  Do yourself and your stomache a favor and come here"}
{"text":"I'll regularly meet friends or work colleagues here for coffee or lunch because they've got a nice front patio and wifi, so I'm connected (a must for me).  Really great food - I'd call it 'upscale cafe' because you don't go in and order a 'club sandwich' - you have your sandwich custom built on your choice of homemade bread, so it's really nice.  Love their jalapeno chiabatta and high recommend it, btw.  Breakfast pastry selection is excellent, so I have to steer as clear away from it as I can or I'd gain 50 pounds.  But try as I might, I can't keep away from the frozen yogurt bar, especially when they have peanut butter as a flavor.  Only place in Boulder City to get frozen yogurt, by the way.  Super clean, super friendly, super service. And they're currently building a bar in the space next door with an outdoor patio area that is going to be killer.  CJ's is a must-try if you are in Boulder City, I say!"}
{"text":"After hearing about Chilly Jilly'z from Nelson, and reading the reviews about the broasted chicken, hubby and I decided to try it out.  We drove all the way out to Boulder and when we made it there, we were pleasantly surprised.  The place is so clean and inviting.  The gals that helped us are really sweet.  I called in my order of 8 piece family meal since it takes 15 minutes to cook the chicken.    We wanted mixed green with the chicken order, but they didn't have it so we selected the mac and cheese.  The staff microwaved the mac and cheese when we picked up the order.  She also meticulously made my float, the dole whipped pineapple and pineapple juice.  When we got home, hubby raved about how juicy the chicken breasts, thighs, legs, and wings were.  The biscuits were delish with the honey and butter as well.  Overall, we are fans of Chilly Jilly'z and we will sure to frequent this spot again."}
{"text":"Polite and friendly staff.  Shakes were very good, interior and washrooms very clean."}
{"text":"I love my breakfast cresant. Really really good. Fried chicken is really good also. They also blend up vegetable and fruit smoothies. They are awesome as well. Im always greated nicely every time I call ahead and pick up ."}
{"text":"The Patio, part of chilly Jilly's but across the road.  You are seated in an enclosed patio that feels so serene.  Each table has a heater for comfort.  They have live music and when we went today it was a beautiful two peice combo who played beautifully but not loud.   Ok  let's get to the food.  I had chicken and waffles with pure maple syrup and my partner had a green chilly omlette. The food is amazing!!! I also had a raspberry mimosa made with Dole whip. WONDERFUL!!!  Everything about this place makes you feel relaxed with perfect food and perfect service.  The only thing I would change is the way you get seated.  The waitress seat you and you have to wait until someone notices you.  We saw one couple waiting so long they  just left.  There were plenty of empty tables.  This place is open 8 am till 1 pm on Sat and Sunday only.  If you are out this way don't miss this place tucked away from it all."}
{"text":"Review for the Patio at Chilly Jilly'z.   First time here although I have driven by this place when I have been in the area.  I thought this established was ice cream based treats based on the name, pictures and reviews I had seen on Yelp.  On this visit I had breakfast next door on The Patio.  This was a break about halfway through are ride around Boulder so right off the bat an establishment where we can bring our bikes in and have eyes on them next to our table already gets high marks from me.     A few different items caught my eye on the menu but chicken and waffles was right at the top so I went with that.  The chicken was fried perfectly and the waffle was cooked correctly making it the perfect combination of sweet, salty, juicy, and crunchy.  I've been disappointed by this combo at other establishments when the waffle is too mushy or the chicken overcooked.  Service was great!  Never had to ask for a refill and were checked on during our meal."}
{"text":"Great place on the way from Las Vegas to Hoover Dam. Stop by here on your way to or back from the Dam. Nice and friendly staff who greets you with a big smile. Food was decent, large portions with great value for the money. We had a cobb salad and a double double burger. Free refill fountain drinks."}
{"text":"After a day of hiking in AZ I was craving an ice cream. I always pass Chilly Jillys'z but never stopped in or knew much about it. This was the day I would give it a try and I'm glad I did. After looking at different options to help cool me down. I saw the dole whip float. Scott serve pineapple, pineapple juice and a blast of whip cream. I chose a small not knowing what to expect and after driving down the road a bit I wish it was a large. Sweet, tart but most of all refreshing. This will be a frequent stop on my Boulder City trips!"}
{"text":"An interesting little roadside diner the pulled pork style chicken was okay but after reading some of the other reviews I definitely missed out the pricing was a little high for what you received in my opinion but compared to the local area and selection I am NOT a chain restaurant type of person and have never seen a Panda Express outside of a mall lol so no thank you!!! I'll stick with my odds at a local spot  worth another try if I'm ever in the area but all in all just fair. the staff was extremely friendly"}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(175/365) \"Broasted, Not Fried\"  After spending the  day  in Boulder City, we made a much needed stop at Chilly Jilly's. My Dole Whip Float hit the spot because it was scorching outside! We also decided to share a Chicago Dog and since we've heard a lot of raves for their Broaster Chicken, we got a two piece basket to share as well.  The Chicago Dog was pretty good, but the chicken was even better...crisp exterior, juicy interior and delicious!  The sides were okay, but if you happen to be in the area, I would highly suggest both the Broaster Chicken and a Dole Whip float.  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  4"}
{"text":"(This review is for The Patio, next door to Chilly Jilly'z, also owned by them.)  The Patio serves an INCREDIBLE brunch 8am-2pm, Sat and Sun.  The rest of the week you are basically left waiting for the weekend.  My dad has apparently started frequenting The Patio on Sundays and decided to share his little secret as I was visiting this weekend.  Four of us dined this morning after church and I basically can't wait to come visit my parents again in Boulder City because this brunch spot knocked my socks off! (And I live in the Bay Area of California, foodie central).  Our table ordered: -The special- Breakfast enchiladas with home fries -2 scrambled eggs, toast, home fries -Chicken and Waffle -Veggie omelet (sub feta for provolone, add avocado) with home fries and corn tortillas  (Note- Home fries are a theme in the above order. Dad says they are better than the hash browns - which the waitress repeated- so I say, make that the easy breakfast choice when you order and go with the home fries!  Now, the rest of your order is up to you and you ARE going to have a difficult decision to make!)  My Veggie omelet was FILLED with veggies.  And Feta.  And yet, the Feta wasn't crazy so I could choose how much I wanted and could easily remove some in spots where it felt like too much.  Added avocado for $1 and it looked like it was about 1/2 of an avocado.  For $11 for the meal including this add, I didn't feel bad with that $1 addition.  The Chicken and Waffles were super tasty (I know, because I finished the waffle and had some of the chicken during the meal).  The Breakfast Enchilada was so good, I wished I could have ordered it AS WELL for breakfast.  Their specials are pretty darn special.  (They also had a Spanish omelet and a Greek omelet this morning- both sounded enticing!)  And those scrambled eggs- well that was the one person's meal I didn't get to sample because my mom ate those too quickly.  Darn.  So, in conclusion, this place is completely legit and I can't wait to come back!  That omelet covered in beef- you know who you are (I think it's the last omelet listed on the menu)- you have my name on it... I might have to get you next time along with another menu item if I can't decide again because wow! - too many choices to limit yourself to one.  Order 2 on Sunday and eat one on Monday... that's my new motto after visiting!  And as for Chilly Jilly'z which I have not eaten at, I did pop in after being so impressed by our brunch at The Patio, and their menu looks amazing- they have self-serve soft serve frozen yogurt... and a burger called the Black & Blue that my parents said was worth the hype.  So Chilly Jilly'z is on my list for next visit to B.C.!  (And to the kind waitstaff at The Patio- y'all are awesome!  Thanks for the great service and sweet compliments today about my dress and shoes.  I'm tempted to move in with mom and dad and try to get a job working for y'all!  And that's saying something!)  Take good care - and I'll see y'all next time!"}
{"text":"Dole whip is great. Broaster chicken and sandwiches are solid. Great place to stop in Boulder City if you are ever driving through!"}
{"text":"Delicious tri tip panini, amazing chocolate shake, yummy dole whip- and very friendly staff. We'd def stop in next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Took me a half an hour to get my food and condiments what the heck, hire more people. Please have all your servers bring out condiments and offer to the people who order their food. Instead having to push the button when I  realize I don't have ketchup etc."}
{"text":"This place was pretty unique. Not to mention it had just about everything. From salads, sandwiches, froyo, brownies, even Dole Whips! It's a perfect place to stop and grab a bite to eat before you go to the lake."}
{"text":"Chilly Jillyz as fantastic ice cream and frozen yogurts! The Vanilla dole whip is my absolute favorite. I use to love getting food from them but have since stopped ordering their food. I really enjoyed the caprese sandwich (I don't know the official name) the first 2 times I got it, it was pricey but totally worth it.. every single time since I was totally disappointed, mostly because the bread was hard and unappealing.. so I won't be going back for the food, but I will be back often for the ice cream."}
{"text":"We stopped at Chilly Jilly'z on our way to Las Vegas. You can eat in their cute shop or take out. They have a great selection of sandwiches, burgers and frozen yogurt. My kids ate mac n cheese, grilled cheese, hamburgers, and tater tots.  I had a really amazing tri tip panini and jalapeño potato salad.  They call the sandwich \"Best Dam Panini\" and it's no joke. It was delicious!  The frozen yogurt bar was fun and had 8 flavors to choose from. I had the pineapple and orange swirled together with coconut flakes on top. Super yummy!   Dinner for 4 was $35 and the frozen yogurt was .43 per ounce, so about $12 for my family with all the toppings."}
{"text":"Great variety of food and desserts, with very friendly service.  Everything is made fresh, so it's hot and tasty.  The custard and frozen yogurt are awesome."}
{"text":"I had the Dole pineapple whip, we were just passing through town and curious to try something new. Also had a sandwich and fries, would like to check this out again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My fiance & I moved to Boulder City around September of 2013. Chily Jilly'z is about a five minute car ride from our home. We had promised ourselves to drop in at some point & for one reason or another, we did not get around to trying it until yesterday. Now that I know what I have been missing, I am kicking myself for waiting this long to experience something SO special.  The highlights:  1). BROASTER CHICKEN: AMAAAAAAAZING! It was crispy, moist/juicy, & flavorful. It is a made-to-order item on the menu & without doubt, it is worth the wait. I even noticed myself eating slower because I was savoring every bite. Seriously, the chicken is THAT good. We had the mac-and-cheese (yummy) & the greatest potato salad imaginable. The biscuits with honey & butter were delicious. The whole meal was a winner.  2). DOLE WHIP FROZEN YOGURT: Yummy. There were many flavors to choose from & plenty of toppings to add to all of that goodness, too. Chilly Jilly'z is the only place in Boulder City (or anywhere near it) that has frozen yogurt like this. It is unbeatably priced at that: thirty-something cents an ounce!  3). LEMONADE: Free refills on freshly-squeezed lemonade on a hot day is Heaven.   4). CUSTOMER SERVICE: Everyone is so friendly & courteous! We even got to meet & chat with Jill (the owner). After talking to Jill, I could immediately see why the place is so vibrant & refreshingly original. She is full of life, full of positive energy, as sweet as ever, & just all-around \"good people.\"  Officially, Chilly Jilly'z is my favorite spot in Boulder City. I wrote to The Food Network to invite Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives to do a piece on this jewel. I have never written The Food Network before, but I was so impressed with this place that I felt compelled to tell the world about it. It DEFINITELY & effectively raises the bar on the culinary experience in our city.   -Juju"}
{"text":"Cute little diner. Everything tastes delicious. I got the veggie burger and it was the best veggie patty I have ever tasted. The sweet potato, waffle fries were yummy too. We stopped here on the way back to Vegas from the Hoover Dam. It was a little bit of a wait but well worth it. They also had a wide variety of frozen yogurt and shaved ice."}
{"text":"Absolutely tasty, fresh, convenient, and quick. We went for a hike at Railroad Tunnel Trail by Hoover Dam and afterwards all 7 of us were hungry. This was the perfect place to get lunch afterwards. The burgers are satisfying and filling. Service is so sweet. The girls running the counter and making the sandwiches are so polite and funny. They accommodate orders for dietary restrictions. 100% recommended **Vegetarian Friendly"}
{"text":"If out in Boulder or going to the Boulder Railroad, stop by here. There is 2 sections - the drive-thru and the patio (opens weekends only). Wonderful and friendly staff.   Patio has adult drinks and live band that plays. Heaters to keep you warm too in the winter. Food was wonderful. Had the enchiladas special and chilly breakfast sandwich. Excellent!!  To drink, peppermint hot chocolate. Great way for adults to warm up.  From pancakes to sandwiches, including veggie ones, there is lots to select from.   Only 3 minutes from the boulder railroad station."}
{"text":"I love their dole whip. I had no clue they had food, and we had already eaten but the food that was coming out of the kitchen looked good. If anything go for the dole whip!"}
{"text":"Our favorite BC, \"go to\", for a great sandwich, salad or a dessert & coffee. If we bring family I call ahead and order the broaster chicken & a couple of sides which takes a little time so it's ready when we get there. Service is consistently good & Christina always gets it right!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, this is the place when I need to satisfy my Dole pineapple whip cravings without having to make the drive to Disneyland. Plus, they have Dole raspberry, orange and pineapple/orange swirl. No singing birds and there is no smell of the water from the Jungle Cruise, but in a pinch, it works.   Next thing, and this ranks high, their bathrooms are very clean. This is huge for me, because you can tell how the staff cares about their store by how their restrooms are maintained.   Third, they sell broasted chicken. Love broasted chicken when it is hot. So juicy and wonderful.    They also have some incredible salads. Their salads are fantastic meals and the staff is so helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes! Dole Whip is available here! Thank you Yelpers for bringing Chilly Jilly's to everyone's attention. I think it's the only place in LV/Southern Nevada area that has the infamous Dole Whip. Nice little mom and pop shop with slightly rough around the edges feel. We came in around noon time on a Tuesday and there was a decent size crowd chowing down on their lunch, but they all seemed to be locals from Boulder City. The Dole Whip Pineapple tastes exactly like how it is at Disneyland. Charm C. and I tried all 3 available flavors including vanilla and orange. Don't waste your time trying the other flavors and stick to the pineapple because it is just that delicious. The orange I must say tastes like a cream-sickle flavor. If I had known the float option was offered I would of opted for that instead. Next time for sure I will have that because I sure do love that pineapple juice. I also now see that they sell some type of pressure cooked chicken called \"boasted chicken\" never heard of it, but it looks amazing on the pictures so I will definitely be trying that next time as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful service from Destrie and other workers. The food is impeccable! I have drove from Vegas to Boulder City multiple times just to \"build my own sandwich\". I love love this place! I even brought my little pup sat on the comfortable outside patio and was offered a water bowl for him! I would recommend and rave about this place to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"Omg this little shack is a hidden gem!!! Driving by on our way to the Hoover Dam I was like okay cool an ice cream shop. We stopped in on our way back to Vegas. This is way more than ice cream!!!   On one wall you have frozen yogurt featuring Dole frozen pineapple whip. Which btw can only be found in Hawaii and outside the tiki room in Disneyland. So good!!!   Want a burger and a beer? They have that!!! Burgers, roasted chicken, salads, sandwiches, panini and some pastries. All hand made. They even make their own bread.   We both ordered the special Blue Marbled jack burger with fries. The only thing I can say is the fries were just processed crinkle cut and over salted with season salt. But the burger was right on the money. Served on a fluffy buttery home made brioche bun. So good. The burger was 100% angus topped Monterey Jack blue cheese blend, peppered bacon and a little sweet chili mayo. So yummy definitely worth the $8.99.   Next time I will add some romaine lettuce to mine like my friend did. Gives it the crunch that's missing. Other side choices are cole slaw, jalapeño cole slaw or fruit. Skip the fries!  Everyone is so nice and they welcome you as soon as you walk in the door. Even the young guy mopping the floors sparks up a nice conversation. They continued to ask us how our meal was. They really seemed to care and take pride in their service and food.  If you are on your way to the dam stop by this little spot!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and the 4 piece chicken meal and chicken tenders are amazing! A friend of mine recommended this little out of the way place and I'm glad he did!"}
{"text":"I love any place that offers your choice of milk without upcharging you! Their frozen hot chocolate with almond milk is one of my favorites!!! I keep telling myself to try more of their food menu but the best dam panini is just so good!!!! The sandwich is $7.99 and comes with your choice of a side. They make it fresh so there's a little bit of a wait but oh so worth it!!! Do yourself a favor and stop by and grab a coffee and sandwich!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! I stop in if I am headed to yoga @ EveryBody's Yoga, I stop when I'm riding River Mtn Loop, I stop on the way to the lake, I stop if I'm just coming to BC because I love being here! See the pattern? Everything is homemade! Breads,  muffins, croissants, focaccia, coffee, frozen yogurt & the cinnamon rolls are oh my word, delicious! It's all been fabulous every time, every bite! In a family of 5 finding a place we ALL enjoy isn't an easy task, but CJ'z covers it!"}
{"text":"Love the boasted chicken and the character of the venue. The menu has a wide variety of sandwiches and tasty desserts. Only fault is that every time I try and place a carry out order, the line is busy."}
{"text":"I've never had a Dole Whip so when this was suggested as an after hike stop for some cool refreshment, I was in!  I was also quite stupid because I didn't know that the place was a serve yourself yogurt place and I went right to the counter to order my Dole Whip thinking they had do do some kind of magic.  When the attendant asked me if I wanted that layered (as per a photo she showed me or like yogurt) I chose the like yogurt.  She left and came back with a copy of Dole Whip that I could have gotten myself from the yogurt dispensers on the west wall.  DUH!  The Dole Whip yogurt was very good.  Tart and in my case a rich pineapple flavor.  While eating my yogurt, I got the chance to check the place out and see tghe other flavors they had and the sandwiches they offer.  This place merits four stars for the yogurt and for the great customer service.  The young lady at the counter could have easily told me I could take a cup and get what I wanted and then have it weighed.  Instead, she took my gray hair into account and did it for me!  :)  I'll be back to serve myself and try one of the Dole Whip floats."}
{"text":"We were driving back to Las Vegas from the lake and wanted to check out a local spot in Boulder City.  We drove by this place and I had to check Yelp ratings before deciding to check it out.  Glad we did!  Had the Blue Marble Jack Burger and it reminds me of the Juicy Blucy from one of the local pubs I went to in Minnesota. Really tasty and juicy!"}
{"text":"Clean place with a very nice vibe. The special burger I got was amazing. The malts were also delicious. Service was good ."}
{"text":"This is an adorable little cafe styled eatery. It stands out in Boulder City. The food was really good!! My husband got the spicy pulled pork sandwich which was SPICY (we like it that way,) and I got the canyon caprese sandwich which also was super delicious just needed a little more salt taste. Overall it has a great environment and friendly helpful employees."}
{"text":"Their bootleg smoothie with almond milk is my favorite. I have tried a couple sandwiches and they've been good.  Go here regularly for that drink. It's so good I down it in 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"Chilly Jilly'z is one of my fast-growing favorite places to go for all sorts of great food with great customer service the two best combinations a business could have and strife to be. If you're in the mood for some very delicious Pineapple Dole Whip you can either order it soft serve style or they can whip it in a shake style (which is what I prefer).  Recently I've been hearing about Broaster Chicken. I know it's been around for a very long time but I never had it. Chilly Jilly'z have Broaster Chicken which you can order either Spicy or Genuine. For my first experience I ordered the Genuine Broaster Chicken wings, this was one of the best cooked chicken I've ever tasted and I've tasted a lot of chicken, granted it most wasn't Broaster prepared but I've had some good chicken from other places. Chilly Jilly'z chicken was very juicy, light and crispy it almost melted in my mouth it was so tender and delicious I wanted more and my stomach was beyond full. I will definitely go back for more chicken and other things on their menu, me just writing this review right now my mouth is watering for more Broaster Chicken from Chilly Jilly'z ..lip-smacking satisfaction guaranteed!!"}
{"text":"I love the chicken wings.  They're nice an plump and freshly cooked.  They're almost too hot to eat.  The selection of frozen desserts is really good.  The baked goods are really tasty.  My favorite thing to get there though is the shave ice."}
{"text":"I specifically headed out to Boulder City to get a Dole Whip from Chilly Jilly'z, ended up ordering some broasted chicken as well, and then I decided to spend a few more hours checking out the antique shops in Boulder City.   Chilly Jilly'z is a cute little eatery staffed by very friendly employees. After I checked in on Yelp I remembered seeing so many friends rave about the broasted chicken, and since it was lunch time I decided to give the two-piece meal a try.   Chicken is broasted to order and it took about 15 minutes from the time I ordered to receive it. It was absolutely worth the wait. Broasted chicken is the way to go, it is similar to fried chicken except it's less greasy, more juicy and better for you overall. I am already craving more of Chilly Jilly'z broasted chicken.   With temps hitting the 100 degree mark, a Dole Whip sure hit the spot. I had vanilla topped with orange-pineapple-banana juice, but there are quite a few different flavor options to choose from.   Chilly Jilly'z is everything one would expect from a small town eatery and then some. For a refreshing sweet treat that will remind you of Disneyland or some deliciously juicy broasted chicken, it's well worth the trip to BC."}
{"text":"Went in for a cool refreshing treat after a day in the park. However, 30+ minutes later only one of us had gotten our drink. Got a refund for all the others and left."}
{"text":"This place has the best fried chicken in nevada!! There frozen  yogurt is to die for!!! Everything else is amazing too!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Pastrami sand on rye. Broasted chicken - crispy skin and juicy meat! Dole whip and fro-yo!!! What more could we ask for? Well, the service was also top notch too! The girls working there made sure we felt welcome. We will definitely be back. We came all the way from hawaii for the Chilly Jillyz experience!"}
{"text":"As we were traveling thru Nevada, stumbled up on this place called The Patio, part of Chilly Jilly's for brunch. Oh my Gosh, the food is awesome, the service is great, and did I mention the food is awesome?!?! The Patio is only open on weekends but OMG, if you are passing thru... you have to stop and ear here!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way back from the hoover dam.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the chicken here.  My wife and i loved our lunch here"}
{"text":"Went after the train ride...bring your ticket get 10% off.  I loved the atmosphere, the food and the staff.  Great patio to enjoy the world passing by...  I ordered the Dam Panini and a chocolate malt.  Great sandwich and drink.  It was very busy and the staff was great under pressure.  Our food came out quick and delicious, not expensive and I will without a doubt be back when I make ANY passage through Boulder City...be sure to include a stop at Chilly Jilly'z!"}
{"text":"So glad that we came here. I was told by a friend to get the Dole Whip. Okay, that's cool...but which one were they talking about. We had the option of Dole soft serve, or even better the Dole Whip float. The float was the soft serve with pineapple juice poured over it, along with whipped cream. We opted for this version.  Looking around, this place is adorable. It was clean, and well stocked. I loved their display of the various breads they offer, right there near the register. They really did look tempting. I could not believe the amount and variety of toppings they offer for the soft serve. You pay by the ounce, so you can go crazy with the toppings if you really wanted.  The finished product was so much better looking than I had imagined. It was so cute with the paper umbrella for decoration. We started in on our float right away, but we should have waited a bit for it melt a bit. Once we were down near the bottom, it all melted together and it was awesome. I can see why people rave about this Dole Whip. I never knew!  We will be checking this place out again for their lunches. Cannot wait!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches!! Jill is the sweetest woman and was very helpful as we decided which sandwiches to order. Had to go back for a malt and it was delicious as well. Loved the friendly atmosphere and great options for sandwiches, ice cream, and sweets. I'll have to go back to try the cookies!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of banana milkshakes in my day. Chilly Jilly'z has The. Best. Banana. Milkshake. Anywhere.   Also: the best ranch dressing, and very good broasted chicken."}
{"text":"BROASTED CHICKEN!!  haven't had this since I left Chicago area.  Love the food and love the staff.  They are all very friendly and make everyone feel comfortable.  Also had the most delicious oatmeal cranberry cookie.  Their salads also look delicious.  A majority of the people bought their frozen yogurt which I will do next time I eat there which will be soon.  The broasted chicken and broasted potato wedges are just like home.  Cole slaw was too dry for me (prefer more sauce) but next time I'll try another side.  love this place!!"}
{"text":"Chilly Jilly's has a really fun menu with lots of sweet variety. Shaved iced, milkshakes, custard, pineapple dole whip you name it. I like that their menu is original and you can't find their items elsewhere. Their drive through made for the perfect quick stop home after a long day at the railroad tunnels. Quick customer service and friendly. I will definitely come back here when coming through Boulder City"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch around 1pm today on our way to the Hoover dam. My husband and I split the tri-tip panini (with avocado and pepper jack cheese) and potato wedges. We asked for the cherry peppers, coleslaw and BBQ sauce on the side. Glad we did because the peppers were extremely hot. The coleslaw had minimal flavor but wasn't creamy which is good. The potato wedges weren't as crispy as I thought they would be. It's a cute place and the staff was very friendly. I would go back if I were in the area but probably won't be a memorable meal, 2 years from now."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to stop in every time I pass through Boulder city.  I finally went in and I was happy I did!  The dole whip was on point. Yummy treats that were fresh and just as good as they looked. I got their magic bar and chocolate chip cookies. Both really good. Next time I'll try their meals. Friendly girls worked there as well. Cute little stop off for sure."}
{"text":"Wow. You must stop here! Absolutely home cooked and surprisingly fast service. Had pulled pork with jalapeno potato salad. It was so good...sorry it's done!!! Fun throwback decor. Extremely clean. I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I am a little obsessed with this place. I look forward to going to Boulder City just so I can make my way though Chilly Jilly'z menu. This cute little restaurant has so much to offer! Custard, frozen yogurt, salads, fried chicken, fish and chips, wings, sammies, burgers, and delicious picks from the bakery. I'm sooo obsessed! So far I've tried: - Pinapple Dole Whip float, it's refreshing and deliciously tart. Great treat for a hot day; - Broasted chicken, potato wedges, and mac n cheese, the chicken was BOMB! Juicy, tender, and not heavily breaded - so freaking good! The potato wedges were great as well, I had to add some salt (I typically like my food salty) but they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside = perfect. The mac n cheese was great too. - Fried fish filets, tater tots, cole slaw -broasted fish filets that also, weren't heavily breaded. Four come in an order, and they seemed pretty fresh. I subbed crinkle fries for tater tots and they were wonderfully crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The cole slaw was ok. The fish comes with home made tartar sauce that has a good consistency and flavor. - Best Damn Pastrami Burger - really the best damn pastrami burger I've had! Juicy and flavorful, omg so good! You can get any burger wrapped in lettuce, great option when you're being skinny. - Go Go Green smoothie - is the only thing I really didn't care for. The smoothie has kale, carrots, broccoli, apples, and cinnamon. I tasted a lot of broccoli and cinnamon, which made it weird for me...  - Energy ball, was pretty darn good! I tried making those on my own before and it did not taste like the one I had here. It had coconut, chocolate chips, oatmeal, and peanut butter, I'm sure among other things. Great combination and texture, it filled me up as well. Definitely something I'd get again. - Chocolate chip and cherry cookie - really tasty. I thought the combination was interesting and it turned out to be delicious as well. I also enjoy the staff here. All of the workers seem to be teens and are super sweet. Always smiley and helpful. Super clean too!"}
{"text":"We stop by here on the way home from Arizona the kids got the yogurts I got the dole whip with orange sherbet and we also got a root beer float.  The Dole Whip was similar to the one from Disneyland and also the frozen frog on ft apache n Tropicana.  It was a refreshing drink for the rest of my drive"}
{"text":"Like most people that visit this shop we ended up here after hiking.   We came here for Dole Whip. It's cool that they offer Dole Whip because usually I only see it at festivals and it's expensive at special events. I tried the orange/vanilla twist and the pineapple flavors. My favorite was actually the orange/vanilla twist. My husband liked the pineapple best, but also enjoyed the raspberry. We used the topping bar to make it into a full on treat. Dole Whip is slightly different than frozen yogurt, but we liked it.   The shop was small, but it was clean and well organized. The toppings for the whips and yogurts was clean and offered a nice variety. My favorite part was the six or so boba options. I love boba on my frozen yogurt.   They offer much more than Dole Whip. I was surprised how much they actually offer. They also have lunch options, a small variety of desserts, and shakes. Definitely a good place to stop if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great spot in Boulder City.  Had a breakfast burrito with home made salsa - excellent.     Super friendly- highly recommend."}
{"text":"This little gem is one you might miss on your way out of Boulder if youre not careful, but dont! It's worth the stop for so many reasons... From all of the choices for breakfast lunch and desserts, to the amazing friendly staff! I got a frozen mocha which was really more like a frozen hot chocolate (didnt taste coffee at all), but it was refreshing and delish. The breakfast turnovers are great, too. I love that everything is made in house!!"}
{"text":"Driven by several times and finally stoped in.  Had turkey blrta and tater tots.  Awesome!   Great portion sizes ie not too much but perfect.  And to add to that, friendly staff, engaged owner, clean.  I will never drive by again.   Notice also huge crowd of regulars which is the sign of a good place.  Also they appear to be a force for good in their community Everyone going to Boulder City should eat there And fresh baked goods too!"}
{"text":"Great menu, service and prices. Who would have thunk I could get a kale smoothie in Boulder City?"}
{"text":"great food!  was there when they opened and two years later its still a wonderful stopping point coming off the lake."}
{"text":"This is a 'must try' while visiting Hoover Dam, and actually worth a drive even from busy Las Vegas.  The food here tastes very fresh because it is, and has a personal touch to it.  I went there twice during my stay in LV, both times for lunch.  The first time I had the barbecue chicken sandwich - it was amazing!  The second day I had a vegetarian sandwich and that was very tasty as well - I requested the chef (as I found out it was Jill, the owner) to throw in things of her choice and she made even a veggie sandwich very tasty.  I will certainly recommend this place and if I am in that area again will visit for sure. The outside and inside both very clean, and so is the restroom.  Just loved this place."}
{"text":"We attended an event sponsored by Chilly Jillys at The Patio.  Great venue and service.  Jill and her mother are great hosts.  The ataff was on top of every aspect of the event.  Let me tell you moms Jello shots the best!.  I look forward to having  breakfast there next time into Boulder City."}
{"text":"We went after we went on the train ride. It was really delicuous. Got the tablt, hot dogs, chicken, and the jalapeño potato salad. Everything was pretty good. If we went back to that area again we would forsure go again!! My mom loved the chicken btw. She said it was one if the best."}
{"text":"With its charming Main Street USA; Adventure Land of hiking trails, bighorn sheep, Lake Mead, and zip lining, and Frontier Land of the Hoover Dam and Historic Southern Nevada Railroad ; Boulder City is the Happiest Place in Southern Nevada. Chilly Jilly'z serves Boulder City guests and residents the delicious food and drinks featured in theme parks.  Chilly Jilly'z serves some of the happiest food in Southern Nevada.     Chilly Jilly'z is located in Boulder City where US 93 transitions from a four lane divided highway to a commercial strip just east of the Veterans Memorial Drive/Adams Street traffic signal. It is a stone throw from the Historic Southern Nevada Railroad Museum and a Cannon shot from Bootleg Canyon.     Chilly Jilly'z serves all varieties of food and drinks to compliment a day of adventure in the Happiest Place in Southern Nevada. Their menu ranges from all types of hot beverages that include coffee and chai tea latte. Their cold beverages include the Dole Whip that Disney Land the Happiest Place on Earth serves. Chilly Jilly'z features a commendable selection of shaved ice and Italian soda. Talk about an interesting 30 flavors such as Jolly Rancher, Bahama Mama, Tigers Blood, and pink colada. If this was not enough deliciousness , their menu also features smoothies, milkshakes and malts. Hungry?  The Chilly Jilly'z menu includes salads, broaster chicken, hot dogs and sandwiches.     In the past couple months, I have complimented my Boulder City adventures with a visit to Chilly Jilly'z. The leading visit was subsequent to a ride on the Historic Southern Nevada Railroad train. From the train, I saw a sign that when you show your railroad ticket you receive ten percent off Chilly Jilly'z. I had my mind set on dining in China Tango Bistro for dinner. However, a cold beverage would hit the spot. Fast forward to Chilly Jilly'z. The facade and inside remind me of a Happy place away from the city. It has that small town atmosphere. There was a sundry of seating with a large TV on the east wall and a self serve yogurt bar on the west wall. Over the counter in the center was a giant menu. With such a large selection it is difficult to make a decision. There are so many choices that adds to a high return factor. I decided on a sugar free strawberry Italian soda. It was okay. If the sugar free was okay I can imagine that the sugary Italian sodas are delicious. When I finished I ordered a cup of coffee. As far as their coffee, let me say that I will stick with Starbuck's. When I breathed in my olfactory sense was taking in the delicious smell of broaster chicken. It was a smell that stayed mentally in my head and led me back to Chilly Jilly'z two additional times.     Chilly Jilly'z broaster chicken meal brings my taste buds to Fantasy Land. What is broaster chicken?  Chilly Jilly'z menu states, \"(Broaster Chicken) is a special cooking process guaranteeing practically oil free chicken while preserving most of the natural juices. Because of our special marinating, breading and cooking, the chicken has a crisp, tasty, golden crust.\" The broaster chicken meal comes in two styles: 1. leg & thigh ($7.99) or 2. breast and wing ($8.99). The meal includes a biscuit, 2 potato wedges (both times they gave me three) and a side. Beverages are separate. The broaster chicken is delicious high quality food that requires a ten to fifteen minute wait. My suggestion is that if you walk in with an intention of having dessert,  look through all the dessert choices on the menu. Regardless of how fond my taste buds were of the broaster chicken, they were ultimately fond of the potato wedges. Up to this day, they are the best potato wedges I ever had. The cole slaw was also delectable.      To serve some of the happiest food in Southern Nevada you need upbeat employees. All three times a friendly woman took my order and brought the food to my table with a smile.     Owing to the delectable broaster chicken meal and large selection of Italian sodas, I see Chilly Jilly'z in my future. Chilly Jilly'z is plain and simply delicious food and beverages served in an upbeat place. When I dine out I want to feel like the Happiest man in Southern Nevada."}
{"text":"Homemade deli sandwiches! Best Dam Panini is my favorite and the jalapeño potato salad is great. Love the Boulder berry Blast smoothies with dole whip. Seriously where else but Disneyland, can you get Dole whip but right here! Great selection of self serve yogurts, baked goods and even gluten free choices too. A little gem in Boulder City. A little wait,  but worth it."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend after a lil hiking action.  Been meaning to check it out for awhile and finally got a chance.  Not a bad joint at all.  It is a small place not too big but has a drive through.  I got the BBQ chicken sandwich it was pretty good. I also tried the Dam Pannini.  It is a tri tip pannini.....that's what I should have gotten it was real good.  The fries that came with it were good but the portion size was a lil small.  There are plenty of options on the menu to include sandwiches, smoothies, frozen yogurt and even fried chicken, and everyone knows LilMark loves his fried chicken, peep this lil place out."}
{"text":"Great stop after Hoover Dam visit. Very clean and biggest plus...gluten free options!!  Wonderful service too"}
{"text":"Best green smoothie ever! When I popped into Chilly Jillyz, I just wanted a little somethin'-somethin' and was very pleasantly surprised at the outstanding variety of offerings! There's frogurt, toppings, wraps, broasted chicken, sandwiches, and of course coffee drinks ... the list goes on. Even with the electric menu, everything looks tidy and organized. The place is spotless. Now I need to come back when I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"Looking for lunch or a snack in Boulder? This is a much better option than the chain restaurants. The kids had soft-serve yogurt, I had a chocolate shake (though I admit I was tempted by the kale-broc-carrot-apple-cinnamon smoothie).  The Dole whip was good, but not as expected - not like sorbet eaten with a spoon, more like a smoothie that is consumed with a straw.   Weather was too hot to have much appetite for their sandwiches, pastries, or chicken. But everything looked good. Would definitely come back on a cooler day to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"The broasted chicken is amazing.  Probably best chicken ever!!!!   My morning coffees are great too.  It really is hard to decide which is better.  But no fountain soda machine? Really? I get charged too much on a can of coke that I have in my fridge at home? We all want a variety of fountain drinks!!!!!!!    PLEASE !!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and clean!!! :D we had the Best Dam Panini with Chai Tea Latte and a Dole Whip. Everything was awesome. Also, this place is nice and clean!  Ran very very well. Everyone acts like they know what they are doing and they are friendly. We will definitely be stopping on our way in and out of Boulder City from now on!!! :D"}
{"text":"Pumpkin cream cheese danish roll thing tasted like it was made with love! The flavor is so natural yet rich that I am literally savoring it and trying to make it last.  The bacon egg turnover is crispy and buttery with just enough filling to not overwhelm. Delicious.  The latte was ok.  I am coming back for more and making more excuses to drive to this side of town!  I need to try this broasted chicken!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Chilly Jilly'z for a couple of chocolate malts (which we are always on the lookout for) during our camping stay at Boulder Beach campground. They were completely awesome. Not only was there just the right amount of malt, the ice cream was fantastic, with the added bonus of real chocolate whipped cream on top. The staff were perky and pleasant and the atmosphere was clean and cute as a button. Just that kind of local place you want to happen upon. Looks like they had great sandwiches and baked goods too."}
{"text":"Friendly counter help. The \"dam\" was the bomb! Free lemonade refills and their soft serve by the pound won't break the bank!"}
{"text":"We drove from LV just so my husband could show us Chilly Jilly'z! The restaurant does not look like somewhere you'd want to stop on the outside and inside it has a old diner kind of feel. But the sandwiches were really good. I had the best dam panini and the husband got the TABLT. Which is actually a BLT with avocado and turkey. Our daughter ate a grilled cheese and mac and cheese. Nothing fancy for a kids meal... For lunch for the three of us we paid $26. If I was in Boulder city for a reason I would probably stop here but I don't think I would go out of my way to drive back."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken. Potatoes were great and the coleslaw was fresh and tasty. Friendly staff and the wait time was not bad at all. Business looks very clean and we will be going back for dessert! Love that your order is fresh when you get it..."}
{"text":"This place is a delight.it doesn't look like much, and I rolled my eyes when my friend took us here, but the food was really yummy. Get the best dam paninni!  Yelp wants me to write more. Yelp is too demanding. They have pickle slices. Also froyo."}
{"text":"We made a random pit stop here on our way into Las Vegas and loved the diner hometown feel of this place.   We sampled their chicken and fries, which were fresh, hot and seasoned well.  Their frozen yogurt, fresh shakes and baked goods were all fresh with many options to choose from.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Their Pineapple Dole Whip is to die for! Every time I go out to either Boulder City or Lake Mead, I have to stop here for the Dole Whip. It's only $3.50 for a small, $4.50 for a medium, and $5.50 for a large. That's a great price in comparison to some new shops in Vegas. They give you the option of adding a different juice and changing up flavors too."}
{"text":"What a cute little shop.  Stopped here after a day at Hoover Dam for some frozen yogurt.  Besides yogurt they have Dole Whip The  only other place I've seen this is at Disney World.  There is a nice bakery case and it looks line they have a real nice food menu.  Place was spotless and everyone was so friendly."}
{"text":"Please put back the Caramel Pretzel sea salt low fat yogurt. Great sandwiches and staff"}
{"text":"I love the milkshakes at this place. Don't do the chain. Actually the chains have a place. But you should (at least once) try Chilly Jilly's."}
{"text":"Great staff great food and awesome frozen yogurts and toppings! Must stop in when you're in Boulder City."}
{"text":"Great find! We've been passing this place each time we've driven to AZ and back, and never stopped in! After looking it up, and realizing  they have Dole Whip, we decided to give it a try! Yum! The broaster chicken was delicious! It was served with wedge fries (which also seemed to be broasted), biscuits, Cole slaw and Mac & Cheese! We also ordered a pastrami reuben (one of the daily specials), which came with a side; we opted to try their fries. Everything was delicious and plentiful. We ended up with a doggie bag.  The place is adorable! If you're looking for some really good comfort food, a Dole Whip float, a shake, some frozen yogurt, etc.. along with a fun atmosphere, give Chilly Jilly's a try!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing so many great things about Chilly Jillys from my fellow Yelpers I could not pass up a chance to go!   It happened to be Chilly's 1 year anniversary the day we went. I had checked out their menu on Yelp and knew exactly what I wanted. I ordered the four piece Broasted Chicken Meal with Mac & Cheese and Potato Salad. One thing I wish they would have told us is it takes about 20 minutes for the chicken. The wait was well worth it. We were going to eat in, but after waiting our butts were hurting from the metal ( not big people friendly) chairs.   When we got home we dug in! I first tried the the potato salad. Ick!!! I believe it had Miracle Whip in it!! (I absolutely hate that stuff) Next I tried the Mac & cheese it was ok, nothing special. Lacked flavor. Maybe if we had stayed and had it there it would have been better.  Now let's talk chicken!!! OMG Broasted Chicken! Yummy! Full of flavor and dripping with juices. I absolutely loved the wing and breast pieces and wished we had ordered just a big thing of chicken! Forget the sides! It also came with huge potato wedges and biscuits. They were ok, but trust me it's all about the chicken!!    They also have frozen yogurt, which I'll be back to try. Also, I noticed they had tons of sugar free syrup options for their Italian sodas and ice cream.  The staff at Chilly's was friendly. I totally understand they had extra stuff going on when we were there (being that it was their one year anniversary), but I felt they were too busy taking pictures to help customers or make food. Perhaps staff pics could have been done before of after the work day.  I'll for sure be back for more chicken and frozen yogurt soon. Mmmm Chicken!!"}
{"text":"I give this place a 3 because of the wait to get food and after we got the food it was all wrong. Other than that, the food was good and the staff is very friendly. Their frozen yogurt is great and they have Dole Pineapple soft serve, which they can make a float with. For Disney park fans, it is exactly like what they serve at Captain Cooks at the Polynesian. It's great. The yogurt is well priced. The only thing that needs to change here is how long it takes to get your food and a better attention to the type of bread and requests from the customer."}
{"text":"A must when in Boulder City! My family and I love going here. There is something for everyone, even coffee, desserts, and cold treats. Our favorite is the Broaster chicken, which is seasoned well, crisp, and not oily! The family meal comes with potato wedges, biscuits and a side. The potato salad is good and if you're looking for something with more kick, there is a jalapeno version. Another favorite of ours is the Dole pineapple whip. Just like in Hawaii and Disneyland! So refreshing. Next time we're in town, I'll have to try some selections from the dessert case and the frozen yogurt.   The Broaster chicken can take at least 15 minutes, so we call it in before leaving our activity. They also have a drive thru for convenience.   They have amazing service here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Jilly's. Try the Broasted Chicken. Worth the 15 minute wait as it's always made to order. Try the Jalapeno Potatoe Salad. Jill and team always make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Having lunch with my hubby! Chinese chicken salad and a delicious Cobb! Homemade sourdough bread..amazing! We also got a side of onion rings:) and a lemon bar and a pecan bar. So good! It's so cool how busy they are getting! We love this place! I only wish I had room for frozen yogurt!"}
{"text":"Chicken, burgers, amazing sandwiches, salads and lots of deserts including frozen yogurt.  Upbeat beach diner feel with a super great staff.  Big smiles behind the counter and even bigger smiles after sinking your teeth into the food.    I got to experience the best dam panini and the tri tip along with the flavor of their slaw, mustard and sauce was tangy and sweet.  It was something of a party in my mouth."}
{"text":"Their broasted chicken is so good!! Soft serves are also refreshing and yummy. Staff is very friendly! I visit weekly for their chicken!"}
{"text":"I like their hot chocolate made with real milk!  The chocolate chip cookies have the perfect recipe and they are soft as well.  I also love how friendly they are."}
{"text":"Chilly Jilly'z was just what the doctor ordered after a 6 mile hike in neighboring Arizona. Chilly Jilly'z was made even more enticing since it's equipped with a drive-thru - we were too exhausted to contemplate standing up and getting out of the car. I ordered a dole-whip float sans the whipped cream and my better half got a raspberry smoothie.   The dole whip float was great and I loved the pink umbrella it came with. Next time I'll probably just get a regular ol' dole whip though. My husband's raspberry smoothie tasted healthy (maybe too healthy). Our final verdict: we'll be back, especially after a long hike.  YELP'S 2018 REVIEW CHALLENGE: #4"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! If you are looking for a great latte, this place is for you! The owner, Jill is super friendly and sweet and the breakfast sandwich is amazing!"}
{"text":"Chilly Jilly's was so good. With outstanding costumer service!! They were so helpful and excited when we walked in the door. So many choices, we couldn't decide. The chocolate and vanilla custard is the best I've ever had. We finally decided on 2 custard shakes and 3 cups of frozen yogurt. And, we had to get a magic bar for 5 of us. They were right, 1 was not enough and they're so good. Next time I'm heading back from Lake Mead I'm stopping in to try the Dole Whip. I hear weekend breakfast is off the charts as well."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich was fresh, hot, and.delicious as was the coffee. The staff was awesome to be sure all of our needs were met. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! Can't wait to go back. We stopped after a warm walk at the Railroad Tunnels. Want to order everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"We got delivery from Chilly Jilly'z for lunch at work. Jilly delivered the food and was really friendly. I got the TABLT...it was nice and full of all the ingredients, the ciabatta bread was really good but it was a bit thick and made the sandwich too \"bready\" but the sandwich had great flavor. I also got to try the Canyon Caprese but it was on focaccia bread, the flavor on this was really good as well. Again I had the same too much bread complaint. For the size of the sandwich it was a good price. I got a side of potato salad which was good as well, nice chunks of potato.  I'm looking forward to trying the broasted chicken and ice cream!"}
{"text":"Cute place with great sandwiches and frozen yogurt. Perfect place to stop after visiting Hoover Dam."}
{"text":"One of my favorite hometown stops on our way in to Vegas. It's a must every time.   Chilly Jilly'z embodies exactly what BC is known for. Friendly people and outstanding service. It's consistently spotless and the staff go out of their way to help you or suggest something new. Now, on to the Dole Whip and Broaster chicken.   Remember Disneyland's Tiki Room with the birds? Remember cooling off with that pineapple treat? Well, it's here and it's exactly how you'll remember it. BUT they have like 3 other flavors. Raspberry, get out of here, it's so good! Just enough tartness and sweet it's so refreshing. But my very favorite is orange. Mix it with a little vanilla froyo and it's like eating a baby aspirin. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about people. I get so excited about it. Dole freakin' Whip, you guys! Yes!  If you haven't experienced Broasted chicken, you haven't yet lived. I can't even explain it. It's kind of crisp like fried but it's cooked in a pressure cooker of sorts so the meat is juicy and tender. Lordy.   Do yourself a favor the next time you're getting dragged by the out-of-towners to see the dam tour for the 100th time (locals, you feel me?), or you're on your way to Vegas from AZ, or heck just make a day out of it. Boulder City is so great! Stop in and see the ladies at Chilly Jilly'z, they'll make you happy. I swear."}
{"text":"CJ's is clean and well kept. Servers are friendly.  The cook was either on Vacation or was taking a nap. 37 minutes to get my cremated Burger with black burnt Bun.  The MAC n Cheese was good but had been previously cooked and warmed up. If you have time to kill this is the place.  Way SLOW service. A addition comment.  We had Friends join us late. Ordered 2 orders of Onion Rings. I believe it was $11.00. They were soggy not crispy."}
{"text":"This is a cute little spot in Boulder City near the Hoover Dam. My friends were craving frozen yogurt after the Hoover Dam tour, so we stopped here. The ladies behind the counter were nice and friendly. They chatted with the kids in front of us, and made them laugh. I think the parents really appreciated it.  My love for mangoes and mango-flavored things is well-known amongst family and close friends, so I HAD to order a small Tropical Thunder smoothie, which was described as a mixture of pineapple, banana, and mango. Unfortunately, while the smoothie tasted okay, I didn't really taste the pineapple or mango flavors, just the banana. So disappointing.  If I ever visit again, I'll probably get froyo or another smoothie."}
{"text":"First timers ! But the food was delish! Bathrooms were so clean, so white . Jill must be a fine woman. We could eat a sandwich on that bread everyday. Husbands actual words,\" I would bread face this bread.\""}
{"text":"I was passing by after attempting to hike nearby in 100+ weather. That wasn't successful and after almost passing out from heatstroke had to stop by somewhere to cool down. This place was IT! and it sure didn't disappoint! They got DOLE WHIP~ remember to add that to BOTTOM of shaved ice. Mango flavor was AWESOME. Mix and match. I got drive through so didn't get to check out inside, but it was pretty damn awesome. STOP BY if you are nearby~~"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area about a month ago and tried this place once as a family and we were there about an hour before closing and it was like they had already closed. The girls at work behind the counter we're short with us and barely even talked and they would not give us most of the things on the list because the kitchen was already closed.   My son is sick tonight and all he wanted was some door with and so I looked on yelp to see what time they close and headed over and they are closed even though it says they do not close the 45 minutes:("}
{"text":"Best service, friendly owner! Broasted chicken best surprise. Baked goods really homemade. Cute decor. Would eat here again!"}
{"text":"Really cool old fashioned cafe, the self-serve froyo is delicious especially the pineapple & raspberry froyo, as well as their pastries dont forget to grab your canoli!"}
{"text":"Chiming In       Salads, sandwiches, broasted chicken, coffees, Italian sodas, shaved ice, malts, milkshakes, pastries, cookies, frozen yogurt, and DOLE WHIP!  All of these are offered at Chilly Jilly'z on Nevada Hwy in Boulder City.  Another bookmark that took forever for me to visit, but it was not overhyped by my friends at all.  As soon as my pal and I walked in on a recent Saturday morning after training at the lake, we were greeted by two very friendly young women behind the counter.  This place is bigger than it looks from the outside.  I didn't know they had a drive-thru, either.  There is plenty of seating out front as well as inside.  I also immediately noticed how clean the restaurant is, with white and blue tiling on the walls, as well as photos that are probably from local professionals?  The bathroom was pristine; thank you!  I was looking forward to protein in the form of the broasted chicken that I've heard so much about, but we were there too early as they start cooking that around 11:00am.  Instead, I opted for the TBALT sandwich: turkey, bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and mayo on ciabiatta bread.  You can have this sandwich hot or cold; I chose hot with mac n cheese as my side dish.  My friend and I shared the sandwich, which was nice and hearty, especially since I don't get enough bacon in my life.  The mac n cheese was the best I've eaten in a while, actually cheesy!  Lastly, I had to have the Dole Whip, choosing 6.4 ounces of the orange and pineapple flavors with coconut and strawberry popping boba.  I know how much my cup weighed since the scale at the register told me so and at 39 cents an ounce, a bargain, I think.  The Dole Whip combo was very refreshing and tasty.  Protein and carbs come in all forms, see?  If you're in BC, stop by and get some here."}
{"text":"Food: small soft serve Dole Whip for $2.15. Perfect size, cheap and deliciously pineappley!! So refreshing on a hot day and the perfect ending on the way back from Lake Mead. Cheaper than the ones at Disneyland!  Location: we had the dog with us, so we went through the drive-thru. So convenient!  Service: friendly and efficient.   This will definitely become a ritual for us whenever we are coming back from the lake."}
{"text":"We spotted Chilly Jilly'z on our way to Hoover Dam.  4 1/2 stars made the choice easy.  Chilly Jilly'z gave excellent service, accommodating & clean!  The chicken was delicious & juicy...not greasy.   We ordered a 4 piece with 2 extras & ordered 4 additional pieces to go.  Don't when we'll be back on this side of town, but when we do this place will be on our list. We also had the yogurt, very good."}
{"text":"Great pecan bar cookies, taste just like pecan pie! also big fan of their peanut butter cookies! YUM"}
{"text":"I have breakfast here at The Patio almost every weekend. Great espresso, awesome specials - in addition to their already delicious menu.   It's a lovely setting with (not too loud) music playing so your conversations cannot be listened to as easily as in other BC breakfast spots.  Service with a smile. Broasted chicken & waffles with real maple syrup. Onolicious huevos rancheros.  Don't wait in line at the Coffee Cup, breakfast is better at The Patio."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop for a frozie or ice cream (froyo) before or after the Hoover Dam. They also have all kinds of food items and many people were partaking. I just always go for the ice cream. I highly suggest the sno cone with custard in a fruity flavor. It was SO GOOD. The fro-yo by the oz is a bit cheaper than urban super fro-yo stores, as well.  Plenty of tables inside and some outside. It's easy to find right on the little highway."}
{"text":"Visited on 7-5-16 around 2PM.  $3.25 got me a small cherry shaved ice with pineapple dole whip.  The shaved ice was a wonderful, soft texture and had plenty of delicious syrup and their dole whip is perfect.  It really hit the spot on a hot day.    The restaurant is kinda overwhelming when you first walk in.  It's rather small but there are many tables and chairs.  To the left there are self-service frozen yogurts and toppings, then straight ahead is the counter with a board behind it for the menu.  It looked like they had literally hundreds of things on the menu.  There was so much stuff on the front counter...it just looks chaotic and cluttered.  My OCD was going crazy LOL   Next time I'd like to try their fried chicken but I feel somewhat discouraged because the table next to us was sitting waiting for their food the entire time we were there.  We had time to peruse the menu, order, pay, wait, eat the whole thing, clean up, go to the bathroom and wash our hands, and they were still waiting for their food.  I would say don't come here in a hurry."}
{"text":"Lots of varieties of dole whip! The shaved ice is REAL shaved ice! We had a mixture of the two and it was delicious! Totally coming back only 30 minutes away from Vegas!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Chilly Jilly'z!  Any time I am home visiting my Mom, I always make it a point to eat here at least once.  When I'm driving into town and remember Chilly Jilly'z along the ride, I can't wait for dinner haha!  Everything I have ever had here is really, really tasty.  I believe they bake all their breads themselves, and they make their fries themselves too.  It's sooo good.  Normally I am not really a french fry person, but believe me, I will eat my fries from Chilly Jilly'z!  My favorite thing to order is the Best Dam Panini with the tri tip, it is put together so well, ugh, I want one now thinking about it while I write this!  Their sandwiches and burgers are a lot of food so you can share with somebody without leaving hungry.  I have also had some of their salads when I am trying to behave myself and their salads are actually really good too (but let's be real, I want the panini! :))  I've never had any of their coffee drinks or pastries but I'm sure they're delicious.  They also have a fro yo section, and I see families come in just for that pretty often.  All the girls that work here are really friendly too!  The only thing that puts a slight damper on things is that they charge 75 cents for a little 2 tablespoon serving of their homemade ranch.  Their ranch is probably the best you'll ever have, which is why they can get away with that price gouging.  I could understand if you ask for extra, but your first ranch should just be a given.  I know it's just 75 cents, but it's also just 2 tablespoons.  I always forget they do this too, so when I ask for ranch when they bring our food, it's kind of annoying to dig into my purse for 75 cents before I eat.    Anyway I am so happy that Boulder City has a great place like Chilly Jilly'z to eat and I'm so glad the business is so successful!  :)"}
{"text":"We used to do root beer floats from next door as our ritual whenever leaving the lake. We did the train ride today and decided to try Chilly Jilly'z. It was awesome. Tons of options to choose from, we had shaved ice with frozen custard and dole whip. Better than the shave ice places in Vegas. Service was great, super friendly and plenty of places to sit inside and out. This is our new place to stop at before leaving Boulder City for the 45 min drive home."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's a nice cute place that you can hang out with a couple friends for froyo.   The chicken is really good as well as the TABLT.   We order here every couple of weeks. Always good!"}
{"text":"Found this place on the way back from Hoover Dam. Very good service and friendly staff. Food was served fresh and so delicious. Variety of shakes and desserts available. Burger was juicy and bun was so soft and tasty. Tots and fries were equally delicious. My daughter loved the home made Mac n cheese. Definitely worth the drive from Vegas. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love Chilly Jilly'z! We stopped here specifically just for Dole Whip after a hike/walk near Lake Mead, but ended up having to get the broasted chicken since I've never tried it before. Service was a little slow, but they were pretty busy and seem to make everything to order - their huge salads aren't premade and they were even chopping lettuce.   This was a day of firsts - my first ever Dole Whip and broasted chicken. I've heard people raving about Dole Whip forever, but I've never bothered getting it at Disney. I got the float, which is pineapple soft serve w pineapple juice dumped on it. - very refreshing and fruity (would be great w/ some vodka or rum), but it's not something I need to get again. I don't really get all the hype, but it was good.   Their broasted chicken is supposed to be just like you would get it anywhere else since I read that you had to use their spices and marinating process if you buy their equipment and use the name. It's pressure cooking the chicken with oil, which makes for really juicy chicken that's also crispy but less oily. The seasoning was way way salty, and I can kind of see why the menu says no msg - I would've assumed it was msg chicken otherwise. Even the breast meat was incredibly juicy and moist so the cooking method is a success, it's worth giving it a try if you're in the area - I don't think I've seen anywhere else in vegas that does broasted,   All of the food I saw other people order looked great, and points for baking fresh bread even for the sandwiches. As mentioned, service was pretty slow, but they were all super sweet, and I think it was Jilly (?) walked around to make sure each table was doing ok and whether they needed anything. It was a lot better customer service than I would've expected for such casual dining. Boulder City isn't somewhere I go to often (this was maybe my 3rd time in 11 years), but I'll be sure to stop at Chilly Jilly'z the next time. They also have a drive thru and delivery within the area."}
{"text":"We have driven by for years (decades) and finally the temptation of Dole Whip won out on the way back from Arizona. We split an order of Chicken Tenders and were wowed by how good they were. Lightly breaded and done just right; they vied for the same score at another chain (PDQ). The meal was topped by the Dole Whip - now two great reasons to return."}
{"text":"I love their frozen yogurt bar. This place is great to stop at as you leave Boulder City. Sit outside and watch everybody go by."}
{"text":"THE WORST SERVICE!! We came in almost 10 minutes before a huge line and ordered a 4 piece meal and told it would be 15 minutes. After 30 minutes my husband went up and asked about our order and everyone behind the counter looked dumbfounded and had no idea what to do. So they finally went and asked the kitchen how long it would be and they said 7 minutes. As we watched basket after basket of food come out we grew more upset. After seeing two huge platters of chicken come out after us waiting for 50 minutes all we wanted was a refund. Everyone just said sorry about that and we proceed to wait. After another 10 minutes and having to get two other people to help do a refund we finally got our money back, after being there for an hour after we ordered and got our refund our chicken was finally done and they said they would put it in a box, at first I said no but my husband said yes we'll take it. After several more minutes my husband asked where it was and they gave it to someone else!! Literally after the worse service you can't offer to comp our meal or our next visit or explain why table after table got service before we did!?! Even the manager couldn't explain. WORST SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"Chilly Jilly'z/The Patio is a Boulder City treasure.  Jill & her staff are very supportive of the local car culture, we meet there every Monday morning for coffee & every Sunday for brunch on the Patio.  Great food, great service and a great place to meet friends & make new ones.  The live jazz music duo, Cash & Lyubo are amazing & there every Sunday.  Try it & like me, you'll tell your friends & come back often.  I'll see you there!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the patio. Owned and operated by the same folks who own Chilly Jilly'z. This was our second visit to The Patio for breakfast. No real issues the first go round. Today we phoned early for a reservation. We asked specifically for the upper level. We stated we did not wish to be under the pergola as we had an infant we wished to keep cool. Upon arrival they attempted to place us right in front of the musicians speakers which were rather loud. And under the pergola. When we reminded the owner who was seating we had requested the upper level. She shrugged and said this is all I have. We would have waited for the upper area to clear. A second cup of coffee was  impossible to receive even though we asked twice. Several other tables did get refills. The pancakes had the consistency of rubber. We will not dine here again."}
{"text":"Great little spot in Boulder City that I would never have heard about without Yelp. After spending some quality outdoor time doing some hiking near Lake Mead, we decided to stop by Chilly Jilly'z on our way back to the city.   We arrived around 1:30 and the place was really busy. There was a line, but that allowed us to figure out what we wanted off the menu, which is extensive. I was more thirsty than anything so opted for a pineapple Italian soda and my fella got a Frappuccino. My friends ordered the Dole Whip float, chocolate malt and some of their famous broasted chicken. The food came out pretty quickly and we sat down to enjoy our food. Everything was really great and we even decided to get some dole whip for dessert. I liked everything I tried and although I didn't try the chicken it smelled amazing and my friends raved about how moist and flavorful it is, so I'll definitely have to give it a try next time.   The atmosphere at Chilly Jilly'z is very welcoming and there is a hometown feel that makes you feel very comfortable here. Watching the kitchen prepare all the food, you can tell they take special care and everything is made from scratch and portions are generous. I will definitely stop by this place again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Friendly counter staff. Picked a Dole pineapple float. Twas quite Yum. I dig the vibe of the place where it's a small cafe that has numerous breakfast and lunch fare offerings but also can be a quick stop to chill and get something chilly hence the same I would assume. They have a drive thru also which is great for those inclined not to leave the comfort of their vehicles."}
