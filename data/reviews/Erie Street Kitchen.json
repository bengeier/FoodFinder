{"text":"I was so impressed the first two times we ate here. Great staff and the first Restaurant to offer fresh oysters regularly on the menu. Unfortunately last Saturday was an exception. We ordered 3 dozen oysters at the start. Our order came out with 19 oysters. When we brought to the chef's attention, he shrugged it off and said he would fix it. We still looked forward to enjoying the oysters, only to find they were WARM! They had not been kept on ice, let alone in a cooler. Added to that, we should have asked if there was a band. They started around 9:00 and after that all conversation among our table of 4 stopped, because they were excessively loud, no one could hear. This included the bartender who was trying to replenish our drinks (I would recommend regularly stocking pinot grigio for the ladies). I've listened to live music all my life and \"I said if it's too loud, you're too old\" many times. But these guys were too cranked up for the relatively small room and frankly, weren't very good. I hope this was just an rare exception. My recommendation is to call and ask if there's a band and if their oysters are chilled or at room temperature."}
{"text":"This place has really done things right:
Had fried green tomatoes , the bleu cheese salad, pimento Mac and cheese: extremely good. Then, ordered the fried oysters. We had great ales from the bar. Everything there was amazing. Laid back and comfortable . Great people too! I can't wait to go back....."}
{"text":"being a big fan of hot chicken i had been anticipating my visit since making plans to go last night, and the expectations set by the reviews were more than met. the layout of erie street kitchen is nice; it is inside the Venice Cafe, which is a bar, so there is a decent crowd and somewhat loud music. you order at a counter and the food is brought out to you in easily less than ten minutes. i was particularly hungry so i got the nashville hot chicken snack, mac and cheese, hot chicken bahn mi, ginger ale, and red velvet cake desert. first thing first, the hot chicken is phenomenal! perfectly tender and the right amount of spice to feel it but have no issue eating as much as you can fit in your stomach. the mac and cheese is perfect for that comforting southern style, and the ginger ale is a great soda from a local company. after finishing the first two dishes i moved on to the sandwich, and i have to say this might be the best chicken sandwich i've ever had. the sauce interacted perfectly with the vegetables and hot chicken, and the bun was soft and fresh. when i go back i will be asking for no pickles, but that is a personal preference. a word of warning though, this sandwich can get messy if you're not careful about how you hold and bite it. after finishing this up i ordered a red velvet cake to go. i couldn't resist it though, and ending up eating it on the walk home instead of tomorrow like i had planned. the cake was moist and easy to eat even while walking, and the icing was just the right amount of sweet as well. overall, i cannot recommend erie street kitchen enough. if you like fried chicken or southern food in general you will be impressed. unfortunately i did not get any pictures, but i will try to remember next time i am back (which will certainly be soon)

an interesting side note is that everything is locally sourced from what i understand. this wasn't heavily advertised in the location, but i am glad to know of it. always love supporting businesses like these."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food prepared by a real chef who clearly takes pride in his food.The place is located in downtown Kent in the Venice Cafe. There are daily specials and a good selection of unique, but not bizarre foods. I've eaten here five times since they opened and have always enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"I brought my parents and two boys here for a late lunch, and everybody really enjoyed their meals.  We tried the Nashville chicken tender dinner with mac & cheese, and coleslaw, the grilled chicken sandwich and perch dinner.  The habanero mango dipping sauce with the chicken was very tasty and the corn meal dusted perch were extremely good as well.  The proprietor was very nice and explained how he had 20 local vendors supplying him with all fresh ingredients.  Everything was home made, was perfectly prepared and tasted really great.  Highly recommended, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Quick food, great atmosphere, wonderful staff, I've never been disappointed when eating here! Plus happy hour drinks are crazy cheap and really great (try the Moscow mule)."}
{"text":"Perch & shrimp, bacon cheese grits, and slaw with hush puppies and pickle sauce.  Just go eat here.  Tons of charm, super friendly people doin the food and behind the bar."}
{"text":"Erie Street Kitchen is located in the Venice Cafe. It open Oct 12, 2016 and is a great addition to Kent. It is a casual atmosphere with quality food that is prepared on-site (not just off the Sysco truck) with a southern flair. I had the catfish dinner and my girlfriend got the chicken tenders (made in the Tennessee hot style) and both were excellent.

Try the mac-and-cheese you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Went with my daughter, a student at KSU.  Sandwiches were awesome. Very fresh & tasty.  Service was excellent.  Pickle soup was quite interesting and tasty!

{"text":"Saw all the good reviews about this place and had to try it for myself. Man does this place live up to its reviews! Tried their Nashville Hot Chicken dinner and everything was so good! The chicken was juicy and flavorful. Got the Carolina BBQ dipping sauce which I highly recommend. Reminds me of the Gold BBQ sauce at winking lizards. The dinner came with both Mac and cheese and coleslaw which were also delicious. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Big fan. Local ingredients. Creative menu. And super friendly staff. The chef even checks on customers to make sure they are enjoying their food."}
{"text":"Based on the positive reviews, my wife and I decided to give this place a try, given it serves seafood. Before I got my meal, which was the most expensive dish on the menu ($20)(aghast!), a grilled Gulf Coast seafood dish of catfish, shrimp, and oysters, I went out of my way to the server to say I hope the new place succeeds, as it replaced a Mexican restaurant recently (that like this one, rented out the space to the Venice). Well, after that, my grilled seafood turned into a fried mess, so we returned it, only to be replaced by more fried hush puppies,, french fries, and 2/3 of what we were supposed to get (it was missing oysters). The owner, who took the order and our money in advance (it is a order and sit down place), told me in ordering that I would get 5 oysters, 5 shrimp, and a good sized catfish slice. None of that happened, after screwing it up the first time, and the quality of the food was marginal, at best, more fitting for a $5 order coming from a food truck at a carnival. My wife's shrimp scampi app consisted of really crappy, small shrimp, likely microwaved or frozen beforehand, and thankfully there were only a few of them.   When the owner or server came by to give us the order we were supposed to get, twice, nary an apology, or an offer to cut something off the bill as an accommodation. I gave the server another chance to do that at the end of the food nightmare, but she said I can take it up with the owner, which I opted not to b/c I didn't think it would serve any purpose. In leaving the place I did not see her even make an attempt to talk to the owner, as she probably wanted to make a beeline out of there too.  Bottom line, this is the first and last time I will eat at this dump, and I can't imagine why anyone would write a positive review. Good riddance. The place will not last long, if Kent and its citizens are lucky."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian there are not a lot of options...however, of the food that I have had I will say that it is amazing. The vegetable sandwich and salad are delicious. I love how the ingredients are locally sourced and fresh."}
{"text":"Best hamburger I have had in years! You can most definitely tell how fresh the ingredients are. The fries were fabulous. Not your typical \"greasy\" burger and fries.
I can't wait to go back. 
My son ordered chicken tenders and they tasted homemade. Not a thick breading, great flavor. While eating dinner the owner came out to make sure our food tasted okay. I always appreciate them taking the time to make sure the customers are satisfied and we were. 
We enjoyed playing pinball for almost two hours after dinner. A great family night out. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here the other day. The chef was very accommodating and asked us for feedback on the fried plantains; they were served with a mixture of wild and white rice and a sweet and spicy dipping sauce, but they were sweet enough to eat without.  They were awesome! We also ordered the fried chicken basket with french fries. The fries were fresh and crispy, the chicken was fresh & yummy, not frozen, and it was hand battered.  After our meal, we were offered fresh pastry tarts. They were a little expensive, but looked good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here!  We got there early on a Saturday.  A college town bar, we knew we would want to dodge the nightlife.  There was no line at the order desk as a result.  Between three of us we tried the Catfish Po Boy, Pimiento Mac and Cheese, Green Fried Tomatoes, Chicken and Sausage Gumbo, and a Fried Tomato and Bacon Salad.  I was very happy to know they serve Norka soda and we had Ginger Ale and Root Beer.

My husband remembers a catfish Po Boy from a favorite Denver restaurant and until this meal had never found its match.  The catfish was perfectly cooked and is served on a fabulous wood-fired oven roll from Brimfield Bread Oven- another treasure in the Kent area.  The Fried Green Tomatoes get a kick from some Siracha Spiced sauce and were nice and thin with a good ratio of crumb; they hold together well enough to eat with your fingers.  The Mac and cheese was just what I like- creamy- but there is real cheese in there.  It sits in that cup reveling in its own flavor- no fad additions here.  It's not bacon, it's not onion, it's not lobster- it's Mac and Cheese!  Creamy, cheesey, but not overly rich, with nice pimiento pieces to recall that standard of the South- shredded cheese with Duke's Mayonnaise and pimiento.  My friend's salad was loaded with veggies and goat cheese and fried tomatoes- she enjoyed every bite.  

We all enjoyed this unpretentious,  well -cooked food.  So many restaurants are \"formulas\", what a pleasure to eat food the chef obviously loves to make.  We will return because there is fried chicken, shrimp and grits, lake perch and desserts to be tried.  Slip into your blue jeans and t-shirts and go give it a try.  Stay late for beers and pool if you are younger than I am!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good (I had the chicken tenders, fries, and mac n' cheese). However, the experience ruined the food. The line to order was very slow and the wait to get our food was even slower. In addition the food was way over priced. Plenty of places in Kent with better food at a cheaper price. Wouldn't put up with the wait and pay that much for chicken tenders again."}
{"text":"What an exciting surprise nestled inside an old dive bar in Kent! The food selection was amazing for a tiny kitchen, with lots of fresh options. The chicken strips were small but freshly prepared and very juicy. The big surprise was the side dish sautéed squash and onions. Such a simple thing, excellently executed. I think they might have been microwave reheated because one piece burned my mouth. But they were so tasty, I ordered a second batch. I can't wait to try other items on the menu. This place needs to quit hiding in a bar and graduate to being a restaurant.  The order-at-counter is tedious when waiting for people.  The lack of service at tables is silly... Grownups paying an $8 price for chicken tenders should get metal silverware and real plates. Applebee's can do this... Paper dishware is ineffective, and offers poor temperature control.   Plastic silverware is not eco-friendly. 

I think the food is great, but the rest of this execution stinks. A diamond in the rough, with great potential."}
{"text":"What a great find. Jeff clearly enjoys cooking. His passion comes through in his simple but festive menu. It encourages sampling and sharing. Lots of Southern accents. Be sure to check out the specials. Everything is as fresh as possible. All the little pots are fantastic. Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Was really craving fried fish for weeks and this place popped up on my search. I'm new to the area and I'm open to trying new things. I was greeted by the owner who was very eager to help me with satisfying my appetite. I ordered the perch dinner along with a snack of the Nashville hot chicken tenders with a side of Carolina Gold BBQ sauce and the pimento mac. The fries that came with my fish dinner were seasoned perfectly and the fish tasted as fresh as the owner described it. The mac and cheese was so unique, but equally delicious. Now on to the chicken tenders....I almost have no words. Quite possibly the best tenders I have ever had in my life. Perfectly crisp outside and deliciously juicy inside. Seasoned with just the right amount of that popular southern heat. I was definitely past my fishy needs. 

More importantly, the owner was the sweetest man. He kept finding ways to entertain my toddler (who I'd unknowingly brought into a bar). He allowed us to try some of his other creations and sent my already spoiled tot home with a yummy Christmas Cookie. Even if the food was not amazing, we'd be back for him. I can't wait to get back and try the shrimp and grits or a po boy...and obviously get more chicken tenders!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY THE BEST Gourmet Southern comfort food ever! The chicken melts in your mouth and the sauce is over the Top!!!! Deviled Eggs Are a must!"}
{"text":"Two of us ordered the Nashville Hot Tender Sandwich. And both came away saying it was the best sandwich we've ever eaten. Like, if you were in prison and given a last meal, that may be what you choose. It's that good. Pickled veggies, amazing bun from Brimfield Bread Oven, sriracha sauce to die for, and the fried chicken. It's insane. I just didn't want it to end.

Another person got a salad with chicken and fried avacado. She raved about it. And the southern chicken sandwich with hush puppies and cheesy grits were just as good. One person hated grits and ate most of the plate without giving the others a chance. It was a happy hour on a Saturday night and the bar bill from accompanying bar, The Venice, was mind boggling cheap. Like, felt like we were stealing it was so cheap. $4 mules, $3 mason jar cocktails, $3 tall domestics. The chef/or maybe owner? seemed to be walking around checking up on things which I like to see. Didn't get a chance to talk to him but would like to pay him a compliment next time we're there in person."}
{"text":"After circling the block 16 times (parking in Kent is fun!) with another eatery down the street in mind, we found a parking slot right in front of this place and decided to give it a whirl. The last time I was in the Venice was roughly ten years ago, and it was a charming dive back then, so I had no idea what to expect now. I was glad to see that it had not changed much, save for the addition of this eatery. Erie Street was a great find for our party of three headed to a basketball game. They delivered fast, delicious, and budget-friendly fare. Two of us had po' boys and I had the perch dinner. Everything was well-prepared and tasty, and we made it to our game with full stomachs and time to spare. Pro tip: make sure you include hush puppies in your experience."}
{"text":"What a great little place.  This local chef has done a great job.  The hot Nashville chicken and the hard boiled eggs appetizer are two to definitely try! Never had a bad meal there!"}
{"text":"Not what I expected.  Not a fan of southern cooking prepared this far north as it is usually very bad.  The chicken bahn mi sandwich was out of this world albeit a little overpriced.

Wish they were open for lunch.  It is inside the Venice café so you will have to deal with the historical decor."}
{"text":"Great southern style food. Great staff & service. Great atmosphere. Great little joint in Kent."}
{"text":"Wow! Great food. Classic southern cooking, seafood, and lots of options. We got our food very quickly & it was delicious-- I got the southern tender dinner with Pimento mac n cheese-- THAT MAC N CHEESE!! Creamy & classic. The service was excellent--friendly workers. The environment was a bar/diner feel, dark lighting, kind of loud, and pool tables. I would recommend this place for friends going out for dinner and drinks! If you want to take your kids here, you may want to come earlier in the day. 21 and up only after 9pm. Overall, loved this place!"}
{"text":"Where do I even begin? As someone who is gluten sensitive, I'm always looking for places that offer great tasting gluten free food. And I found one in the heart of Kent, Ohio. We decided to come here after checking several yelp reviews and I have to say we were not disappointed. My wife and I enjoyed the snack Nashville hot chicken tenders. I paid extra for the mango habanero dipping sauce while my wife went with the ranch to cool the burn. Holy yummy! 
We then had to go for dinner, my wife enjoying a blackened shrimp platter with fries and coleslaw, and green beans that actually came from a can but were to die for!
I went with a special for the evening and can't remember the name, but it was chicken thigh meat with some skin attached and deep fried (maybe Chicharrón?) with a gluten-free coating (again Nashville hot) with the Carolina barbecue dipping sauce. Oh, and I ended up subbing the tater tot's for the fries.

You have to pay a little bit more, but you certainly get what you pay for. Next time we're in Kent, we will be back. The owner and his daughter were wonderful."}
{"text":"The food here is ridiculously good! The service is prompt, efficient and friendly. The menu is changed weekly with new and interesting takes on common dishes. I've never been disappointed and prefer the paper plates here versus the local \"fancy plate\" establishments."}
{"text":"This gem is hidden away in the Venice Cafe and is worth your time. I am a huge fan of rotating/changing menus and ESK is one of the only, if not the only, eatery in Kent that changes their menu from week to week. Why? Because ESK does their best to support local businesses and therefore makes menus based off what's in season that they have access to. They also source their baked goods from a local baker-entrepreneur which makes me like this place even more. 

The prices are slightly higher on certain menu items than others, but it's worth it. I just wish this place was their own restaurant instead of being lodged in the drabness of the Venice. I can only hope that this place stays open and that bigger and even better opportunities are ahead of ESK."}
{"text":"Our first visit.  We were very pleased with the food & service!  Erie shares spaces with the Venice Cafe-this is a counter service establishment, but the the staff is so attentive & very friendly!   I had the Nashville chicken & my boyfriend had the Lake perch.   Everything is cooked fresh, loved that the hush puppies were homemade & not out of a box.  
My boyfriend got a bite of VERY overwhelming fishy taste with the perch, which he attributed to the skin being left on the fillets.  He still really enjoyed the meal and we both can't wait to come back!   
Note-while this is counter service & the dishware is plastic, this is not cheap food!  And I mean that as a compliment.   They obviously take pride in the meals they prepare.   Come check it out!"}
{"text":"Brand new restaurant! It is inside the Venice. They have Poor Boys, fried and grilled seafood, wings and more. We had the Lump Blue Crab Cocktail pot with toast and chips and Pimento Cheese and Mac. We will try the catfish or oyster dinners next time."}
{"text":"The chicken tenders are LITERALLY to die for. I think about them all the time. I've never had better chicken. This place rocks."}
{"text":"Of all my dining experiences in the Kent, Erie Street has become my absolute favorite. The food is exceptional. Always fresh and made with care. No mass produced nonsense here. The owner and his wife have put a lot of heart and soul into their food and it definitely shows.
They like to change up the menu to keep things interesting but some of the mainstays is their incredible mac 'n' cheese, the Bahn Mi sandwiches, and the beignets. No matter what you order, you won't be disappointed. The food and the atmosphere keep me coming back time and time again.
(Other items I have tried and loved: Poke Bowls, southern style chicken dinner, and crab cakes.)"}
