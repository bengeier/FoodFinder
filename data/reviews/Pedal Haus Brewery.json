{"text":"This place is so cute. Good food and good beer but THE SERVICE SUUUUUCKS SO BAD. Want water for the table? Too bad. Want change? Too bad. Want your food quickly? TOO BAD. Hannah was our server. Awful. Just awful."}
{"text":"The new outdoor seating isn't for me. The previous set up allowed for a great open air natural feeling but now it is cluttered, obstructed and filled with flat screens. It used to be my go to place but not anymore."}
{"text":"Pedal Haus brewery, come for the beer, stay for the food. The appetizers here are AMAZING the Pretzel with beer cheese is out of this world, and the fried cheese curds are delicious. They have two beer menus, one of in-house brews, and the other with \"guest\" brews. I personally fell in love with the Bernsteinfarbenes Weizen Brewed in house, it's great tasting with hints of caramel and a deep amber hue. The beer is definitely reason enough for me to return, but the food, oh my god, the food is absolutely to die for. The atmosphere is amazing, pedal haus put some serious money into decorations and the sheer size of the restaurant is almost overwhelming. To top it all off the service was excellent, our server Domenic was incredibly attentive and knew his stuff. Pedal Haus is a wonderful treat for all of your senses. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for socializing, especially the patio. Drinks are tasty. Food fell very short of expectation. Orders came out incorrect, salads were spicy (?), pasta was flavorless, fries and burger were cold. Good if you want to hang and grab a beer, but don't plan to eat here."}
{"text":"We were here before the ASU game so it was packed and had just been open a couple of days.  There were some glitches that could use some improvement to make it more efficient, but they should be able to figure those out.

Awesome staff..  Very friendly, accommodating and helpful as could be. A+ to them. Large beer selection and the burgers and garlic fries we had were great.  

Happy hour pricing before a game as well (I'm guessing that may change) so it was also a quite the deal to boot."}
{"text":"Came here with some family and was excited based off the menu. Took about twenty minutes to get waters and our orders in and at the very least another 40 minutes for our food to arrive. This is including appetizers which arrived at the same time rather than before. It didn't get better when the pretzel and beer cheese, nachos, and brat all arrived completely cold. Additionally, I had ordered a green chile burger and was brought their classic burger. Then waited another 15 minutes for a new one to be brought which was also cold and undercooked. I've always ordered my burgers medium rare but that was extremely rare. The bun was straight up stale and overall had basically no flavor. I also ordered it with chips and it arrived with fries but at this point, I was done trying to fix their mess.

I will give them credit where it is due in that they discounted our meal and provided some gift cards to remedy the situation after hearing about our distaste. The pot pie my girlfriend ordered was really the only thing I found to be decent. This does not change my horrible impression of not just one fault, but a number of repeated problems. The food is just not worth the price or your time. Maybe you'll get lucky and get food that someone cared about cooking, but I won't be taking my chances again."}
{"text":"The place has POTENTIAL for 4-5 stars, don't read my 2 star as my final answer. The remodel looks great, and there are multiple locations throughout the establishment, inside and out, for even large groups to have semi private space. Ambience is really nice, and I would love to hang out there drinking the $3 haus drafts all day Sunday for football. The beer is \"good\", though they could have several more haus beers and beer styles to select from, as well as some guest drafts (CA / CO / OR beers). I did not try the food.  I went on week 1 of NFL, expecting the best. Unfortunately, even though there are 20-25 large screen TVs, and all (I believe) can be set to their own channels, a few of the morning games were nowhere to be found. And at the transition from am to pm games, (there were only 3 pm games) we were left with post game interviews and commercials from those games that were done. Eventually only two of the three pm games came on, one of them already several minutes into the 1st quarter. But at one point, the DirectTV feed was blacked out since the SEA / GB game was on local 10. It took several minutes, finally having to ask them to turn it back. Fans shouldn't have to ask if they can turn the game on, should be a manager dedicated to these kind of details. Give it a try. But they better get it right, soon, because you usually don't get 2nd shot at the audience. It is nestled on the interior of 7th/Mill and as I said has a great outdoor patio, even ping pong and Corn hole. Inside part is like restaurant, and there is a living room bar in back with couches and some other games."}
{"text":"Best place to hang out in tempe. Their beer is good too but we go for the games they have outside. Its also super roomy and never overcroweded."}
{"text":"First time here and loving it. Food is great, fast service and interior is just amazing. Must visit!"}
{"text":"Great ambience, you can sit and chill and have good beer. You should try the in house brewery even if you're not a fan of beer, I bet you will surely like it. The food is delicious as well. You must try the fries, they are crispy and we'll seasoned. A perfect combination of food, drinks and ambience. Will surely come again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the menu! The atmosphere here is so relaxing. I can seriously come here once a week and try everthing on the menu! Burgers are amazing, chicken pot pie was the best I ever tasted and simply fell in love with the bacon wrapped dates! And please please try the deviled eggs....... It has BACON!"}
{"text":"Worst dinning experience ever!!!! If I could give negative stars I would. Ordered multiple drinks and never received them. Friends were charged for items they also never received. Asked to speak to the manager and the manager used explicit words and asked us to \"calm down\". Never have I been treated with such disrespect at a restaurant. Love the location but unfortunately the service blew it for us. I am sad we will never be visiting this establishment again."}
{"text":"Went there last night after Rowing class, was HUNGRY!  We split a Ruben sandwich  and salad (instead of fries). The salad was pretty big and most delicious!!! They put the perfect amount of dressing and it had a great mix of greens! The Ruben was fantastic!!! Their 'kraut was different yet good.  We ordered it on the side and honestly, the sandwich was perfectly great without it (does that still make it a Ruben?? Humm). Great beer selection as well. Will be here again to replace any calories I burned off while Rowing!! Lol"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and super fun environment. I appreciated that they had ceiling fans (although the one above us wasn't working) and misters going to keep it comfortable. Enjoyed playing some bag toss as well as ping pong. 

Food: I had the haus salad with Salmon and it was ok. Nothing overly amazing about it. 

Service: Not great. We saw the guy filling water glasses more than we saw our server and we had a group of about 15 people. I think they were definitely under staffed (we had a reservation) and the server we had didn't seem to know anything about the menu, the beers, the games etc. Our group ended up just going to the bar to order drinks and food about 45 minutes into our evening there because everyone go tired of waiting on our missing server.

I would go again, but I would order something else to eat and would insist on a different server."}
{"text":"After walking up and back Mill Ave. I thought I would stop in and give Pedal Haus Brewery a try. Starts off with their Porter, which is quite good. Then ordered their Black and Blue burger and a side salad for dinner. The burger was seasoned perfectly and cooked just as I ordered. The Kolsh beer was quite nice as well. 

Jake at the bar was very good and personable. Called me by name all evening, I like that personable touch."}
{"text":"Pedal Haus Brewery is superb! The service is out of this world! The owner named Julian even serves you at the table. He is by far the nicest man. My waitress was really sweet too and always made sure we were doing okay with drinks, etc. you have to try the mussels. The broth is made in a wine sauce to die for. Also what's popular is the smoked dates. The flavor with sweet and smokey compliments each other. I tend to only eat aro laces where the service is impeccable, and the food is fresh."}
{"text":"What an awesome place to hang out pre-game.  College football on TV. Loud, college football atmosphere. So fun, good food and cold beer too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went in on halloween, waited for at least thirty minutes, could not get service(or even a server to look my way), completely understaffed for the occasion, they probably had a good drink but I'll never know. I'll probably never go back, one bad experience does that, too many other establishments in the area."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for the great patio! Food is disapointing.. 15. For fried ckn which is really the size of 2 ckn tenders.. their version of a wedge had some peculiar dressing,  and mediocre service.."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed with the service. I enjoyed the atmosphere and beer but service was poor. My gf is gluten free and it is an allergy. They didn't have an allergy menu but the server didn't hesitate to say what she could eat. She ordered the Asian style burger, no bun.  When she gets it she has a bite and immediately knows it has soy sauce or terrayaki (both have gluten). She began to have a reaction which lead to us leaving 2 hours before our friends due to her pain. We informed the server so he wouldn't tell others it was safe. He asked if she was okay. She said no. And he was awkward about it. 

We get the bill and the food is on there and they up charged up for \"haus salad\" cause we asked for no bun. Again no apology for giving her wrong info or asking the chef. I talked to the manager, all while the server stared at me at the front of the restaurant. The manager removed the food from the bill after some hesitation. He was going to bring me the corrected bill, but ended up sending the same waiter over so that was awkward.  We had auto gratuity on the bill because our party. It was 12 bucks before the correction and 12 after. So the waiter got over 20% for bad service 

We never received an apology for the whole incident. And we had to leave early cause my gf had a reaction for the night and next day. 

My other group of friends (15ish) also said they experienced bad service. Long waits for drinks, being ignored.  Majority walked to the bar instead.  I'd avoid going again. Other better places in mill. I planned to reach out to the restaurant privately but they don't have a contact by email either, only if you are having a party"}
{"text":"the service was great friendly staff! The food was OK seemed cold and the food tried to be a little tooooo fancy.... But great for a quick drink before the movies. AMC RIGHT NEXT DOOR :)

THE TVS for sports seem a little off they might need to change the tables/TVS"}
{"text":"Liked the atmosphere and the setup of this place but the food is no good. Had a falafel sandwich with salad. The salad consisted of lettuce an 2 cherry tomato halves.  The falafel were hard and didn't taste good.  Too much bread, not enough Tsaziki, very dry. Probably the worst falafel I ever had.  Other people at our table weren't impressed with their meals either.  It's too bad cause you would expect better food from a place in a location like that. Definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Was excited to try a brewery here. Excited to see a mostly empty bar. But...wtf. Need to be a man to get service at the bar. Two groups of guys walked up and got served right away. I made eye contact with two women bartenders. Then the male bartender. Nada. Wtf. Spending my money elsewhere"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday to watch the Cards. They have tons of tvs and a great patio area. Our bartender was the best. Problem is they don't have any football specials. Well Bloody Mary is $9... On Sunday. What? When asked bartender said that this is a bar/restaurant not a sports bar. I respect that... But then why all the tvs!?!!! I will be back to try the food (menu looks amazing) but for Sunday football, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"First off their Moscow mules were really good! We had a salad and the pretzels no complaints there. The only bummer of the night was the service. We sat down and had a server come by us on three different occasions without any acknowledgement before we had to ask for someone be sent to our table. We ended up getting drinks at the bar in the meantime. We were looking forward to the cool atmosphere but will doubtfully return."}
{"text":"I love this place i come in every monday the food is delicious and the staff is so kind i cant wait to come back"}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying I'm not from Chicago or any other place known for their phenomenal cheese, but who doesn't love them some cheese! Especially if its deep fried right? I've been to quite a bit of bars around town and I'm pretty sure everyone has their version of cheese curds. Its kind of like pizza, you can't really screw it up too bad. This goes without saying the cheese curds at this place is hands down the best I've ever had! I literally I go to just eat their curds. Plus they've got a great selection of beer. I mean beer and cheese curds how much better can it really get?"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo awesome! We had our holiday party there, for 150 people plus guests, and the service was ON POINT. I never went without a drink in my hand the entire night, and if I was running low, several different servers were on top of it making sure we were well taken care of. The patio is super cool with outdoor games and space heaters to combat the chill. We only had apps, but the food was phenomenal, especially the mac and cheese, and we will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Great beer cool atmosphere nice hostess bar tender and waitresses. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"I found this place on one of my business trips to AS. Good beer, great food and really inexpensive especially during happy hour! Been here 3 out of 3 nights on my trip and had the beer can chicken tonight. Wow! After a couple hundred chicken dishes in the last year, I cannot remember chicken tasting this good and SO moist! Apparently they change the menu tomorrow but I hope they keep this dish as I WILL be back! And the fish and chips and single/double IPAs were no slouch either!"}
{"text":"Outstanding menu...and amazing selection of brewed beers on tap. We has the Blue Cheese Bacon Burger...great flavor. The Chicken Pot Pie is a must.  Very attentive waiter who provided several stong recommendations.

The brewed beers are really what makes this place special. You must get the beer flight...sampling 8. The Amber is my favorite. This place is such a gem for Tempe...great space, vibe, and location! Its a destination....my favorite on Mill Ave.  I highly recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"Great beer, awesome atmosphere, delicious food, huge patio. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite spots in Tempe. Great atmosphere, great food and great beer! Not much more you can ask for."}
{"text":"The beer is great, so if you're going for that then you'll have a great experience. The food menu has been changed drastically, often. I used to love going and enjoying the food and beer. But now the food is mostly sub par."}
{"text":"What an awesome place, great decor, great food, great ambience.

Prefer addition for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Checked this place out before a movie tonight. Sat at a table in the dining room for a drink. Our server Bryce came over and immediately started going over the beers they brew and had some great recommendations. We both finished our beers and decided to do a flight. We picked 2 and he picked the rest! The food looked good as we will be back to try that! Had a great time! Bryce is extremely knowledgeable! Defiantly will ask for him next time we visit."}
{"text":"Don't come to this bar if you're trying to have a good time. My group and I came to celebrate a birthday. One or two drinks in, about half of us got \"cut off\" in a very condescending way. This bar used to be very enjoyable but the heavier guy with the beard is not good at dealing with customers. Will not be returning any time soon.

RE: I had not even finished one drink and was laughing with my friend when challenged. Not sure how that fits into the safety guidelines."}
{"text":"What horrible service we had tonight.  They were so terribly understaffed at the main bar it took almost half an hour to get a beer.  They wouldn't even look at you.  When I tried to catch them as they went by with their heads down they would just shake their head like I was wrong for trying to get their attention. Shame on management for not properly staffing a bar on a game day."}
{"text":"This place was so good, I almost wanted to come back the next day, like asap! My friend and I both had salads, they were both good sized portions and both innovative recipes and tasty.  They were also quite healthy and fresh.  I was pleasantly surprised to try a Pedal Haus brew for $3 on Happy Hour (it was amazing actually. Reminded me of one of the best beers I've tried in Belgium).  The service from both manager/owner and waitress was outstanding.  My friend and I sat outside in the beer garden, it was super fun!  Loved the lawn chair circle as well.  I definitely recommend.  Not often I give 5 stars but this place earned it."}
{"text":"Chicken Pot Pie - yes please!  My friends thought I was weird to order this when we came here for drinks, but holy moly was it good.  Flaky, piping hot, flavorful goodness.  I've never had a better pot pie in my life and it came out fast too!  The beer here was okay, but what was lacking was service.  The waitress did not want us there and was obviously annoyed with us.  We had been drinking, but I wouldn't say we were loud or obnoxious.  Just a small group who kept to ourselves.  Oh well, maybe this establishment prefers the tipsy folks to head elsewhere. I liked the setup of the restaurant.  The patio was really nice and was a pleasant place to hang out while enjoying a beer.  I would still come back!"}
{"text":"The beer selection at Pedal Haus Brewery is stunning! I suggest customising a flight here! The Haus IPA is definitely a favorite, along with the tripel!  The Fun, outside setting is the best. Day drinking in the atmosphere was a blast, especially with the super friendly wait staff. This is the only reason i would set foot on mill these days."}
{"text":"The place is really cool but food is way overpriced for what you get. Just paid 16$ for a beet salad smaller than my hand with some added shrimp which were soggy and clearly previously frozen.. come for the booze not the food. They also ran out of beer steins and hummus!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at Pedal Haus after a long day touring ASU. We were a bit concerned after ordering the hummus and cheese fries for appetizers. The hummus really didn't taste like hummus and the cheese fries were a bit soggy. But, the burgers were delicious and the beer was really good. It was too cold to sit in their patio area, but we'd love to try it again on another trip."}
{"text":"Had my birthday here! Reserved a fire pit which had heaters and its own private TV as well. Very cool atmosphere and great service. Some of my friends ordered food and said it was delicious. Can't wait to go back and see for myself."}
{"text":"New favorite spot! Drove by Pedal Haus searching for a spot to have a few drinks on Mill- and ended up here. Tucked right in front of the AMC, the restaurant itself is hard to miss. Service was super quick and the quality of food was great. Fair priced, but a little pricier- including parking I spent about $40 for meal, drink & tip. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"If I could put no stars I would. We sat at the bar for a good couple of minutes, maybe around ten minutes, and not once were we acknowledged by the bartenders. And we would understand if they were super busy and there were plenty of people waiting before and after us but there was a couple that sat down a few minutes after we did and they asked if they needed anything and still blew us off. They purposely went straight to them and turned away from our direction and left again. Not sure if it's because we're hispanic since everyone else there wasn't but they sure made it seem that way when they helped everyone around us and not one bartender bothered to help us."}
{"text":"I was a guest of the memorial service that was graciously hosted by Pedal Haus on Sunday, March 5th. The service was being held for a Pedal Haus employee who had passed away a week earlier from a tragic automobile accident. I cannot begin to express the gratitude of the family, friends, and co-workers of the deceased who were all invited to attend the reception immediately following the funeral service. Not only did Pedal Haus close down to the general public for 3 hours to give the funeral party privacy, but they also catered all of the food at no cost. I know it was a great relief to the family, both financially and emotionally, to be relieved of the burden of planning and hosting a reception during such a difficult time. Pedal Haus is a wonderful local business who should be promoted and praised for their generosity and kindness during this unimaginably difficult time."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a great idea, but unfortunately the service is horrible. I came here with a large party and there was one server who appeared to be overwhelmed by the number of tables in her area. Our food and drink orders took a very long time and one person in our party did not get his food until 30 minutes after everyone else. Although this was frustrating, slow service is understandable  with a large party. What is not understandable is when we asked to speak with a manager. He took 20 minutes to come to our table, accused us of lying about when we put our orders in and told us to \"calm the f$&@ down.\"  None of us had even raised our voices.  I have never experienced a manager express such a lack of concern towards upset customers. DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"About a week or two ago I went to Pedal Haus, we go often, I even had my bday here a couple years back, anyway, I'd never gotten around to writing a review. So me and my bf eat keto so we come here and order wings with their buffalo sauce, shishito peppers, side salad, and the roasted Brussels sprouts and we add a fried egg on top because WE LOVE EGGS! Haha anyway the last time we were here we ordered the usual and my bf took a bite of one of the wings and it was sweet. If you're unfamiliar with keto it means we eat very little carbs, high fat, and absolutely no sugar. So we flagged down the manager and let him know the buffalo sauce was sweet. He said there was no sugar in the recipe but that he'd check with the kitchen, he came back and said there was no sugar, but that if we thought they tasted sweet that he'd switch them out for us. We put the first wings aside and they took them away. The manager then came back and told us they tried the wings and they were indeed sweet, someone had messed up the recipe for the buffalo sauce! We knew we weren't crazy!  anyway, we are so thankful because they made it right for us. We love Pedal Haus"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend of mine after a movie at the theater next door. The beer was GREAT, however I didn't care too much for the appetizers we ordered. The brisket egg rolls and tempura bratwurst weren't very good, the bratwursts were super tough and hard to eat with a random wooden stick coming out of it that was enormous and the egg rolls were basically meat wrapped in egg roll and fried with a sweet and sour dipping sauce that you could get at the grocery store - nothing special about it. I'll come back for the beer, but definitely going to try something other that what I did before."}
{"text":"\"It's all about the Beer and supporting local business\" 

11AM Monday morning and about time for a beer or two. Being a Kolsch and coffee fan I'm down with trying the Koffee Kolsch from Huss really interesting aroma coffee notes finishes clean. Next up wanted to try a Nitro beer and the Maple Milk stout was way too sweet, sure you can use adjuncts like maple syrup and milk sugar shouldn't it ferment out a little more and not overpower the beer? Here is where the 5 star comes in the barkeeps suggests another nitro and the Firestone Walker Velvet Merlin is like perfection in a glass some sweetness finishes smooth tight creamy head.

Didn't stick around long enough for the Gemultlichkeit to kick in."}
{"text":"Menu was very interesting however waiting for 14+ minutes and still no one came to take a drink order when the place was half full required we get up and leave. It's a shame because it had the potential to be good."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I was a bit disappointed by Pedal Haus. The outdoor seating area is definitely the main appeal.

I was alone on a business trip though so I sat by the bar. And waited way too long to even see a menu. Bartenders were not the friendliest and it wasn't even thaaat busy (which would have me be more understanding).

I had a flight of beer and tried the falafel sandwich which were both mediocre. I could see how it would appeal to college students as they're right near ASU, but as a visitor I was not impressed."}
{"text":"I just sat for 17 minutes without anyone asking me if I wanted to drink. There are 20 other places on Mill that I could go and get good service, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"First time here - love the way this place looks. Parking is free on Sundays. Things to play, lots of tvs, great beers - tried a flight of beers and their brews are tasty. The bartender, Cheyenne, is a keeper - friendly, informative, and fun! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Have you tried the wings? No, seriously, have you? Get the wings, naked with sauce on the side. They come perfectly fried and lightly seasoned with salt and pepper. After grubbing head over to the beer garden for some table tennis or corn hole. The only improvement I would make would be pep up the service a big, staff could be a little better trained but overall a pretty decent spot for lunch, happy hour and a night out with friends!"}
{"text":"An excellent option for a brewery/bar in the Phoenix area and definitely my favorite in Tempe. These beers are well made, taste phenomenal, and you get to enjoy them in their outdoor beer garden or their beautifully designed restaurant. The tap selection features most of their beers, including seasonals, and some other breweries they feel like sharing. I've been back 4-5 times in total and the beers hold up pretty well. 

Our waitress was super willing to letting us try beers before ordering a pint, and the service was really prompt and friendly throughout our group's stay. 

Another awesome perk is that their merch is awesome. Not like a lot of other breweries who just stick their name on a shirt and ask for $25. These are sick and they have lots of options. 

Update: 
Not suited to handle large groups on game day."}
{"text":"5 stars for the facility itself and the decor. 3 stars for the food. 3 out of the 4 people at my table had fries come with their meal and we all agreed they were way too salty. My lobster roll wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't memorable. I'll be trying something different next time. Plenty of beer choices and the staff is friendly. Great place to go with a large group to watch sports games. You have many choices as far as what kind of seating arrangements: outdoor bar, indoor bar, regular tables,  patio furniture, open style seating, etc. Outdoor games and activities as well! Lots of outside seating but there are plenty of space heaters to keep you toasty. Overall recommend for large groups looking for a spot to hang out for a few hours."}
{"text":"2 stars is me being nice. Short review = go to Culinary Drop Out down the street.... FOR REALZ!!

The lower star reviews could not be more right! I thought well....let's try it out anyways...welp shame on me. The 2 stars are for average service, polite hostess and bacon wrapped dates. We ordered the Green Chilie Burger, Bacon wrapped dates and two beers. All of the reviews regarding them being out of beers is the straight truth!! Not only were they out of their own IPA, they had beers listed that they have not carried for 3 months now. The burger was severely undercooked and bland, the dates were on point but not worth 10 bucks...2.00 per date  when we brought up the issue of the undercooked burger we were given a shoulder shrugging \"sorry\"....lol ok whatever i'm never coming back here again....like never ever!"}
{"text":"I visited a couple of times right when it opened, and it has evolved so much since then. Visited for their anniversary and enjoyed every beer I tried. Staff is first class and attentive without being intrusive , food is 10 out of 10  I'm happy I came back, and I look forward to visiting more often. If your looking for the best place to drink beer in Tempe , this is it ."}
{"text":"Hung out here for NFL games Sunday, enjoyed beers on the massive patio with some friends. Overall the environment is really cool with multiple bars and plenty of cool features and games with tons of space.  Didn't try any food but the beer selection was good, service however was lacking and that is what my rating is based on, I probably would've been better serving myself at the bar.  Other then that, very cool set-up...... I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place has been many restaurants over the years, but the latest version is the best! Crafted beers and honey hot wings are the best. Plus the music isn't blaring in the restaurants so conversations were nice instead of yelling at each other. The only negative is Downtown Tempe's parking is awful, but that's isn't P Haus' fault."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot on Mill! They did a great job with the remodel and new menu. I've been four times since they reopened and I've had a great experience every time."}
{"text":"I've visited twice so far and the food was great both times, as well as drinks...attentive service at the table, not as good at the bar but overall the vibe is always great and will definitely be back sometime."}
{"text":"The service here is great. The hostesses and servers were on point. A couple of reasons why I give it two stars is mainly because of the drinks and the food. I ordered a Jameson on the rocks and it came back watery which meant it was shaken. No big deal because I asked for my second Jameson on the rocks not shaken which is what I prefer. The fried pickles were really good and the caesar salad was kind of okay. I really wished they had the nachos! What made me disappointed was the fact that my Jameson drinks had an up charge of 1.50$ for being \"on the rocks.\" So basically an extra 3$ added to the tab because I had ice in my Jameson. To me I think this is ridiculous, I have never seen this before and it doesn't make sense to up charge this. IF I come back, I will have to ask about the certain up charges."}
{"text":"Came for a beer with some friends and ended up staying all night! Had some great muscles and the best chicken finers I've ever had. 

The in house 6 month barrel aged quad was delicious and the Berliner Weiss brewed by the women of Pedal Haus and Four Peaks was crisp, clean, and came with an empowering back story considering the craft beer world is nowadays thought of as a male dominated niche.  

We played ping pong and bags all night! The layout is warm and sofisticated, Kade was a great server and Gus was a super knowledgeable bartender! Me and my girlfriends have made this our new home"}
{"text":"Met with co workers for an end of year holiday party.  We sat in a private area we had our own Tv, and sliding glass doors! I had the ghost house pepper cheesesteak which came with fries-- I did ask for au jus sauce on the side, sandwich was delicious not too hot, little bit of spice in each bite.  Service was great we had two waitress for our total party of 13 people. The remodel looks great! It wasn't too busy but there a decent amount of people for a Wednesday.  They had ping pong, corn hole, and plenty of TVs and fire pit.  Pricing is average cheesesteak was $12.  Will be back would like to check it out on the weekend."}
{"text":"On our first visit (mid Oct 2015) they had the entire patio closed (on a Saturday afternoon no less) for a wedding reception.     Who does that?    Especially after just opening.   On our second visit, (today) -- the patio was very low key and not very busy - yet we experienced extremely slow service, and unresponsive management.  25 minutes to get our beer and when we asked for some extra bread (to finish off our Hummus) it never arrived.   Not sure if the grand opening \"kinks\" are still getting   out or not but management really seems to be sleep walking.   On a positive note, the Kolsch was tasty, the hummus was very good, and the decor/environment was very hip/trendy.    Overall however, Not a great experience at all.    Walked over to El Hefe and had tacos and a bucket of beer within 5 minutes, yet the patio was packed.    Get it together Pedal Haus.  Four Peaks is just down the street and the service is always spot on."}
{"text":"3 facts about my experience at Pedal Haus

1.) I sent back my salad because I didn't like it 
2.) the manager literally totally me to \"go fuck myself\" (the bald guy)
3.) they charged my card, but I paid in cash."}
{"text":"Gotta love this spot.

First of all, they make their own beer. Yes, taste and variety are excellent. Prices are awesome too. (Specially during their happy hour - mon to sat 3-6:30pm)

Food itself is not the best (as in gourmet) but it is something you have to try, it will get it's job done.
Lot of variety on their menu for all types of cravings.

Open patio is great with lot of tvs to enjoy all sports.

Service staff is definitely on top of things. 

Must go spot to give it a try in the Mill ave.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever. We came here after church on a Sunday to watch the ASU game, and we found hair in our chicken wings. The manager came over and took out the hair and pulled it out of the chicken in front of our entire party. Which was disgusting. Then promptly returned with a new set of wings. Our table was never a bussed properly we constantly had to move aside our fresh dishes for dirty plate ourselves. Drinks came randomly and our service was terrible. Very disappointed Tempe."}
{"text":"The beer is great. Their tripel is top of the line. Had their double IPA and also loved it. The food is an entirely different story. We've been coming here for a couple years now and the food has been on a steep decline since. We had the poutine which were awful. The cheese was ice cold and the lack of \"chicken gravy\" as disturbing. It's hard to suggest anything from the food menu. They try way too hard to offer fancy dishes when they really should take a queue from four peaks and Az wilderness. Great place to have some local craft beer but would suggest finding food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I don't know what some of the negative reviews are about because this place is nothing short of delicious. I've been here once for dinner and today for lunch. Both times I've came here, we had Marissa as our waitress and she awesome. As for the food, YUMMY. Highly recommend the green chile burger and the steak for dinner. Today I brought my whole family and they all agreed that it's their new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that makes me wish I were in college again. 
Their menu is more limited than I had expected, but everything I ordered was pretty good (I've been here twice). 
Great selection of beers and a really nice outdoor sitting area. Good vibes all-around."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight with my fiancé, definitely going to be one of our go to spots!  The atmosphere is awesome, the patio is great!!  We ordered a couple porterhaus brews, split a burger and the cheese curds all of it was excellent.  Service was good good."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and I love it! Really big, open space. Lovely outdoor area. Casual, nicely done interior as well. Food is great, but limited menu options, but it will probably expand soon. My favorites are the turkey pastrami sandwich, cheese curds, and brats, so good! Service is pretty good. Looks like it has 2 bars inside and 1 that isn't up yet, outdoors. Im looking forward to frequenting this place when it heats up. It's got such great potential for a sunday funday spot."}
{"text":"We went here to watch a college basketball game. The atmosphere is great. I like the industrial feel and games outside. After we were seated, we had to wait at least 10 minutes for the staff to change the tv channel. Also, some of the tables don't have the best view of the tv screens. Our server was super cool. He knew the beer selection and menu well. I ordered the wedge salad. It was huge! I was disappointed I couldn't finish it. It was like a never ending salad. We paid our bill and then played ping pong while watching the rest of the game. This is a fun bar, but the food is just alright."}
{"text":"I dont know why this establishment lacks stars!!! The food is great, the atmosphere is perfect & the staff is always courteous & professional while being cool for the environment!!!! 

Pedaul Haus' draught beer list is always tasty & full of variety for everyone's taste. The bathrooms are clean & the price is average inexpensive. 

We prefer sitting outside in the biergarten;  even when its 105° outside! Their mists & shaded sitting makes it super comfortable!

If you tried this place before & didnt like it; please give it a second chance. The owner remodeled it months after opening, the menu did change as well. So definitely dont give up!"}
{"text":"Great spot to chill and grab some beers. Stay away from the nachos. Everything else I've tried on their menu is tasty!"}
{"text":"This is a HUGE space, 3 bars a great outdoor area and plenty of tvs to watch the big games. I cant speak for the entire menu as I was here for a private event and the food provided was limited. There was mac n cheese, wings and assorted meats and cheeses along with a couple of desserts.  This is still a new place and I think it has its kinks to work out, such as the fountain drinks they have are not set up right, the sodas were off and the tonic and club soda also not good, but something easily fixed.  A portion of the patio is dog friendly."}
{"text":"Literally I have been here for 40 minutes at a table and I have spoke to the manager twice and I have still not ordered dinner.... it is sad because it has potential to be an awesome place"}
{"text":"Really fun environment didn't really have the food just had the fried cauliflower which was amazing and some drinks, wish the music was a little better!"}
{"text":"Went to the grand opening....
I would think at the grand opening of an event you would have more than 1 bartender working the front bar. We waited for 10 minutes to get a beer and would've waited longer if I didn't ask one of the 3 bar backs (who completely ignore you or tell you \"sorry I can't help you\") to get the bartenders attention. He rolled his eyes at me and went and whispered something to the bartender who helped 2 other people who had just arrived before coming to us who had been standing there. 
That happened within the first 30 mins of getting there. Other than dealing with that bs, the place is nice and would be a perfect place to hang out when it cools down. There is only dining inside, lounging is all outside and it was pretty hot. We tried the food truck food and it was real good! Plenty of food for the price"}
{"text":"We wandered into this brewery while looking around on Mill Ave on Saturday, 6/23/2018. We're in our early 40's but still like a good brewery! First impression was that of a fun, lively place. This establishment has a fantastic patio! The waitstaff was extremely attractive as well. The atmosphere was that of, \"light industry/factory/warehouse.\" It was clean and interesting.

Our waitress, though very attractive, messed up our appetizer and salad dressing choices. I was thinking, \"wow, she screwed up twice, good thing she's hot\". After I told her about each issue, she offered immediately to fix both, and did. I respected her for that. *Side note: \"Looks fade; your heart and soul matter the most.\" Just because someone is hot DOES NOT mean you want to spend the REST OF YOUR LIFE with them! Think about it GUYS!

We DID have +fantastic+ Reuben sandwiches - best I've had in years! I would go back JUST for those sandwiches! Our appetizer was delicious, but the salads that came with our sandwiches were tasteless; as if they had NO dressing at all. I lodged a complaint, but I doubt it will matter.

For the record, the Phoenix area/ASU has a ton of hot women. The problem is, some or a lot of them, \"fake the funk\"- they just don't care about service while working as wait staff. This brewery is near ASU so there you go. Though most non-religious college guys just want to get laid, and don't care about service, I understand the brewery's marketing approach."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. I visited during a recent business trip and actually ate lunch and dinner here. I love the layout of the place and the many TVs that you can watch from any seat. The burger and salads were good and the beer was cold, but there are a few things they could work on. First, expand the menu. I thought the lunch menu was limited, but since I wanted a cheeseburger I didn't mind. 

When I came back with another group for dinner, the dinner menu was the same limited lunch menu! Odd, right? I tried one of the salads and it was good sized and tasted fresh, but the people dining with me were disappointed with the narrow selection. One guy was visiting from the Midwest and wants bacon on everything, but he couldn't get bacon on his burger. The waiter said the only bacon they had was wrapped around the olives and pre-made. I ask you, how can a restaurant not have bacon available for a hamburger?

Maybe they'll expand the menu as they get more experienced, but that was the only knock on this place. The servers were friendly and quick, the food and beer tasted good, and the atmosphere was relaxed and casual. That's a win in my book."}
{"text":"Alright. It was, alright. The Crudo Haus Salad was good, the second one I got. First one had almonds on it. As I am allergic to nuts, if that were on the menu description I would have said something before ordering. That's why I had to sub balsamic dressing for the almond milk dressing. My son had the mustard chicken sandwich, look really good. He took a few bites and told me it tasted weird. Being typical mom, I told him \"you ordered it, yo u eat it\". After he ate just the chicken out of it I tasted the bun. Yup, tasted weird. Burnt in fact. Smelled burned even. Sorry son. Told the waitress and got the old \"let me talk to my manager\". They took a big ol $2 off! His sandwich was $13! All he ate was the chicken... For alright food, I probably won't be back. Sad because I work on Mill Ave just down the street."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is VERY cool! Love the patio architecture. 
Beers they offer are nice too! Not a fan of the food overall. Just average at best! But, not a bad place to hang and have a few beers."}
{"text":"Oddest service issue I've ever encountered.  I've heard people there complaining openly about the bad UNTRAINED severs and finally encountered some really bad service myself.  I actually had a bar tender tell me I couldn't have my beer in a glass rather than a mug because it was the managers \"rule\". I laughed thinking she was kidding but she actually refused ...I'm a very thoughtful and generous tipper but that got her a 1$ tip.  Hopefully they explain to the girls that there are a hundred places on Mill for drinks and PLEASE DONT PISS OFF THR CUSTOMERS FOR NO REASON.  
The environment and setting are great.. the food menu is pretty well rounded AND I'd have to say that the food itself IS above average"}
{"text":"Good service and great beer selection.  I really want to like this place because the atmosphere is great, but the food is no good.  I've eaten here a couple of times and I don't think I will ever again.  Most recently ordered the lobster roll, and it had fish bones in it!  Three different times I bit into bones.  The whole point of shellfish is that there are no bones, it really grossed me out.  My friend had a salad, the chicken was rubbery, and sadly most of the salad greens were not fresh, wilted.  She couldn't even finish it.  Really was not worth the $45 check, so I don't think I'll recommend it to anyone unless the go for drinks only."}
{"text":"Very unique atmosphere. The outside fire pits are great. Good was very good. Beer menu more limited than I would have expected."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and brews! This place is huge! Whether you want to sit outside or inside, play games or just hang at a bar this place has it all! 

The design is really unique and makes it a really fun place to relax. There is a private room you can rent for events or can sit around fire pits outside when it's cold. 

I just stopped in for their Haus IPA and was impressed! Didn't get any food but it looks great. Don't know why I didn't try this place earlier ."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Sunday night. Kinda slow service. Great food and atmosphere though. The renovations are very nice with fire pits and lights. Chicken fingers, pretzels and cheese and lobster roll were good"}
{"text":"Such an awesome location to grab a drink and sit outside! The food menu is small but the drink menu is expansive. I was pleasantly surprised to see that crowd skewed a little older (30s, 40s) for Mill on a Saturday night. The outdoor picnic tables, games, many tables (no fighting or waiting to get a seat!), and fire pit are perfect for setting up and enjoying a relaxed few hours."}
{"text":"I really love the atmosphere here and think it's a great place to grab a few drinks or a bite to eat.  We sat at the bar top and had outstanding service.  We were really impressed with the beer menu and enjoyed hearing the bartenders' recommendations.  We did order food which was good, and will certainly be back to try some new items."}
{"text":"Had to review because the service was top notch! It's your normal bar, food, good burgers. Nathan behind the bar was a gentleman and a scholar. Recommended the Witbeer. The bar wasn't very crowded so I appreciated his company and talking sports with him. Also, they have a ping pong table!!!! Good times. I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING!! It was our first time but word of mouth brought us here and I am floored as nothing was bad about this place! Food fantastic and customer service second to none!! Our waitress was so informative and bubbly! I will  come back!  It was.  Great date night all around!!"}
{"text":"This was a fun spot reminiscent of the Vegas strip. Activities and the open patio make it a nice place to spend the afternoon. However the brewery smell was a bit off putting indoors. I would rank overall a 3-4 because the venue was a 5 and the beer was really a 2. It's better that your grocery store finds, but not by much. I don't think it's the brewers fault, but the lack of good water in the area. Set your expectations for beer low and you will have a great time at the bar."}
{"text":"I met up with a few buds for a a few brews this past Saturday before heading over to the nearby New Belgium Tour de Fat. The brewery is in the heart of ASU Tempe nestled behind a large apartment high rise (unofficial student housing basically) and in a really awesome location next to shops and restaurants and a short walk from Mill Ave. I probably would have spent way too much time and money here had I gone to ASU!

There's plenty of outdoor and indoor seating, cornhole and ping pong, and a sweet industrial/modern vibe. They also have a ton of domestic and craft brews on tap besides their own, and Saturday afternoon is also apparently happy hour, so everything was very reasonably priced. Probably the best part though was that they let us rent out solo cups and ping pong balls for a few games of beer pong, which I had been craving for the last couple months as I am entirely not ready to give up my delinquent college lifestyle."}
{"text":"5 stars for food + beer! 
3 stars for service. eh. 

We popped in here for an air conditioning and food break while riding our bikes throughout Tempe during Tour de Fat on Saturday. Thank goodness for Pedal Haus because I was about to pass out! It was toasty out there. 

Anywho, we quickly ordered a cold beer, hung out on their couches inside near the front bar area {great for groups!}, and ordered some munchies! I ordered their wheat beer and it was delicious. It came in a fancy rounded glass that felt very classy! I also ordered pretzel bites that came with maple butter + cheese sauce and chicken tenders! The breading on the chicken tenders was so crispy and fantastic. They too came with great dips - I ordered ranch on my own and it was delish ranch!  I would absolutely order both of those items again! 

The service, however, was lacking. The bartenders were not very friendly at all and kind of gave us attitude when we were asking questions. Oy! They could have been stressed because of the crowds, so hey, who am I to judge. All in all, the service could have been friendlier."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I can't think of anything negative.  The first time was with 3 coworkers and one of the guys and I shared our lunch so we could try a couple of things.  We went halvsies on the BMLT and the green chile burger.  Both were very nicely done.  They actually cooked the burger medium rare and it was a great burger with lots of flavor with fresh ingredients.  As good as the burger was, the BMLT outshone it for sure.  I love the twist on a BLT by using fresh mozzarella and pesto.  That sandwich was fantastic, and I'm really surprised I didn't get it again the 2nd time I was there.

One of my coworkers had wings and the other had a chicken sandwich.  Both of them really enjoyed their food as well.  The house made chips were a nice touch too.  On that visit Kayla took great care of us and was friendly and efficient with refills, and had no problem handling separate checks.

Their beer selection looked interesting when I was there the first time, but since it's frowned upon to drink during working hours, I returned the following Saturday with my husband so we could have some beer and enjoy the patio.  

On that visit we tried a beer sampler and ate the Cubano and chicken pot pie.  I have to admit I think I gave him one teeny bite of my pot pie, but kept the rest all to myself.  They've got a great recipe and it was perfect comfort food for what turned out to be kind of a chilly afternoon outside.  He really enjoyed the Cubano, and the beers were good as well.  The standouts for us were the Dubbel and the Marzen, but we didn't taste a bad one in the bunch.  As an app we tried the pretzel and that was perfect and lasted about 10 seconds!  On that visit Alena was our server and she did a great job even though they were fairly busy.  Whoever designed the place did an excellent job.  Like I said, I have no complaints and look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"I grew up in Tempe and remember when Islands was at this location and then it sat empty for some time after it closed. But is looks like Tempe finally found a winner in Pedal Haus. It is a locally owned brewpub that features handcrafted European-style beers along with a Belgian-American gastropub menu. They opened in 2015 and just recently went through a renovation. They have some pretty creative dishes like brisket ragu pasta, lobster mac & cheese, tempura-fried cheese curds and moules frites. You can't miss this place because it is huge. They have three bar areas with an enormous patio (with cornhole) and beer garden. I was first introduced to Pedal Haus on a food tour of Tempe last year and happy to finally make a return visit. I started my day off with the Bavarian pretzel which comes with sides of beer cheese, stone-ground mustard and a maple butter. The pretzels are shaped liked a baguette and come served warm and soft. The maple butter was a pleasant surprise. Then I got the Green Chili Bacon Burger which is a pretty good-sized burger loaded with all types of flavor. I'm an ale guy and enjoyed their amber ale for my beer choice. One fun fact that I found interesting is that they recycle heat in the brewing process. The steam (which is typically lost) is distributed to a hot water tank that warms up the next batch. They have a killer happy hour that offers reduced prices on their appetizers and beer. Like many of the new breweries opening up, they are pet friendly, so feel free to bring your dog."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but the food was not good for the price. I ordered a Cesar salad with shrimp. The salad was $8 plus $6 for the shrimp. The salad consisted of lettuce and dressing. Yup that's all. No parmasean no croutons, no tomatoes. If you want beer ok but I would waste money on the food. Oh and the service was slow"}
{"text":"Slow service, the main food menu stops at 11, awful late 90's/early 2000 rock playlist (3 doors down at midnight on a Friday, are you joking?), also again, slow service, my party got our food before our drinks. I would come again if their beer was better, I give their brews a B+."}
{"text":"Bar service was abysmal, at best. Drinks were good, but they made you feel bad for ordering them. Maybe try getting a table, if you have a group, bartenders seem to be annoyed by multiples."}
{"text":"Went on a friday night to find a fairly packed crowd but not overly so and sat at one of the few seats left at one of the several bar areas.  Huge selection on tap and good service from the bar tender, did not sample any food but from what I saw being served it looked good.  Have to mention the bar maids were all looking great in their outfits.  Nice venue with indoor and outdoor seating, live music, several bars and ample parking behind the place it's worth a visit (paid $4.00 for parking, forgot to ask if they validated)."}
{"text":"Meh.  I'll cut them a bit of slack because it was their first weekend open.  However, the place really rubbed me the wrong way.

Beer selection- They actually have a good selection for snobs and those who could care less.  Seasonal brews, brews you've never heard of, and although not my personal favorite, a good selection on IPA's.  The sizes on their draft selection is a bit odd, either 16 or 32 ounces.  Don't get me wrong I love a big beer, but with some of those heavier darker beers I'd love a mid size so it doesn't get too warm.

Atmosphere- The place is huge, with a huge patio and plenty of seating.  It seems they could accommodate parties of any size. There are a few bars to sit and relax as well.  Plenty of tvs turned to the correct (sports) stations.

Food- The lady and I wanted a few appetizers before we went out.  The menu is small (why the huge kitchen?) and leans more toward the \"crafty\" style food.  We had the prime rib rolls and some french fries.  The food was actually pretty good, but the cost was definitely not worth it. For 2 beers and the appetizers it was $42. A little hefty for a college area bar if you ask me.

Service- This is where my complaints are.  First, it took the lady 10 minutes to greet us.  After browsing the menu with like 6 items on it, we made our choices before she even came over.  The beer mugs definitely weren't chilled either, but that is management/ownerships fault if they don't have enough mugs to keep cool.  Once our food came out, my girlfriend had asked if they had any ketchup because their $5 fries aren't served with any sauces.  He said they were out of ketchup (which happens, I get it).  I then asked if they had any ranch. I kid you not the guy said to me \"you're at a fancy place, we don't have ranch\".  I wasn't aware I was at a Michelin Star Restaurant (even those have ranch).  That guy really rubbed me the wrong way, so we asked for some aoli, which apparently they had but never showed up to our table.

We came on the Saturday night with ASU playing a home game (most left by half-time) and the Summer Ends festival all happening within a mile of the place.  We showed up at 10:15ish and the hostess told us they served food til 11.  Once our waitress showed up, she said they stop serving food at 10:30.  Again, why the trouble with the big kitchen if you're not going to serve food with two of the biggest events in town?  As I looked around the restaurant, next to nobody was even eating!  Huge waste of opportunity!

Here's my advice to you Pedal Haus- expand your menu to hit a larger demographic and also maybe serve food until, ya know, midnight like most other places down Mill.  Especially since it isn't a club-type atmosphere, why waste that much money making a beautiful kitchen if you aren't going to use it during peak hours? I just don't understand.  Also, your employees are a little pretentious and don't have great customer service skills.

For now, though Im staying away until I hear of improvement."}
{"text":"We went there on Sat night around 11 pm, there was a good crowd , decided to stay ! Went inside and sat at a bar , the bartender told us he is closing .. Okay? ( sat night 11 pm on mill ) that's okay , so we moved to the other bar which seemed pretty busy , sat at a table , while there were still a group of people drinking and hanging out .. But when every time we tried to get the server attention , she literally just ignored and walked by us couple of times ... And if wasn't even midnight yet ...We just gave up and left. Pretty disappointed on the first visit , didn't try anything at all. Not sure will we ever go back. Yet it's a very nice , spacey , indoor and outdoor brewery !"}
{"text":"Nestled in a cute little enclave, the location is great. You wouldn't know how big it is by the looks of it from the outside. This place is in the center of a college town so you definitely get the college crowd, but I was surprised to see an older crowd there as well. 

Craft beer options were great. We ordered a couple appetizers and had a few beers. Bratwurst were great. Service was good, though we had a little trouble finding the bartender a couple times.

Overall this place is pretty solid. If I can find a babysitter again, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice hidden gem of Tempe. Awesome beers, really good food and outstanding service/staff. This will be our go to when in Tempe"}
{"text":"This place is poppin! Lots of good beers on tap. Had the pothole potter and Dragoon IPA. Good also quite tasty. Big place and lots of people: right by the theater and love the German outfits!!"}
{"text":"Place looks nice. Big. Inviting. However I doubt this place will last long. The food is over priced. The burger was mediocre, dry, and small. 
I had that fries and gravy app and I literally threw it up a few hours later!! The fries were also overcooked and hard. Went to stick a fork in the fries and all I heard was crunch and didn't get anything on my fork.
Bartender took my friends ID and mine for using a copper cup. He didn't give our IDs back and we had noticed once we left and went to another bar 2 hours later. The Moscow Mule was the weakest one I've had anywhere! 

Food is overpriced!!!

Go for a beer. That's about it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to stop In for a beer and a few apps . I love trying new beers and this place just does beer good ! Their Blanche is one of my favorite beers of all time . Their fried pickles are the bomb and so are their nachos . They also have a really good Mac and cheese . 

The regular service and bar service is always great . But ask for Ali she's the best server there ! She's super attentive and will never let your beer go empty ."}
{"text":"Aside from the brews, we frequent Pedal Haus for lunch and have only once been disappointed. This was when we observed the fish & chips were no longer on the menu. Coworkers& I voiced our concerns and were surprised to see it back on the menu on our next visit. 

Earlier this week they hosted our fantasy football draft in the \"penalty box\". 12 team PPR, fantastic venue, good snack/ appetizer options too."}
{"text":"We were taking a slow walk on Mill Avenue, wasting time until we head to the airport after a weekend in Tempe, AZ for the Pat Tillman Run. We saw the silo down a side street and came in for a closer look. We wish we would have found Pedal House sooner. A lot of shaded outdoor seating and great selection of $3 craft beers and cocktail specials for Sunday afternoon. We had the wings to go with our Kolsch and Marzen beers and took our time enjoying the atmosphere and the attention that the staff lavished on us. All was delicious. Thank you, Mike, for being so helpful to a couple of tourists who stumbled on a gem. We will be back next year!"}
{"text":"Very cool vibe, mostly outdoors. Great beer and food. We had the hummus (no need for large chucks of red onion on the plate), wings were great, Bavarian board wasn't really a board, kinda small - needed more cheese for the pretzels. But really cool atmosphere and yummy beer"}
{"text":"The beers are great and cheap during the happy hours! Great ambience - well worth the price."}
{"text":"Had a good time here. Nice selection and food was spot on. First time in Tempe but I will definitely make this a spot when I come in town for business. Convenient and very close to stadium and campus for football games."}
{"text":"Awesome spot! Great food & beer selection! Patio will be perfect to hang on when the weather is nicer! Happy hour from 3-6!"}
{"text":"The food was great. Loved the atmosphere outside in the beer garden. 

I ordered the pint and beer and there were two fruit flies in my Jameson shot . The manager Michael came over; he was really casual and nice, he sent another shot my way. 

I was surprised once I got the shot and it wasn't even comped on my bill? I'm not trying to get anything free, but don't say we'll take care of it and then not comp it. Seems like an industry standard to comp in that situation. 

Not sure I'd seek this place out anymore."}
{"text":"Great food, terrible service. Waiting 20 minutes instead of 5 for seating - likely due to the fact that the hostess wouldn't take a name for our party even when one was offered. Someone wandered up to our group (two couples) at one point and said, \"are you the party of three?\" Uh... no. 

Two at our table ordered flights. One of the people at the table ordered beers from both pages of the draught list and the waitress came back 10 minutes later to tell them they could only pick beers from the first page of the list. When a replacement selection was made, she said \"oh... we don't have that again until March.\" Then why is it available for order?!?! What the hell? Our waitress knew absolutely nothing about beer. 

Beers were okay. I sampled the Tripel, Cherry Sour, Porter, and Bourbon Stout. The tripel was okay, the sour lacked any substantial cherry flavor, the Porter was unremarkable and the stout was really potent. So much so that I could barely finish the small sample I had. 

Service was terrible. Absolutely terrible. The only reason this place gets 3 stars instead of 1 was because the fish fry was so delicious and the cheese curds were effing incredible. Two types of tartar sauce are provided, both are equally delicious and one is more of southwestern spin on tartar. Three out of four at our table  had the fish fry. The fourth ordered the mac and cheese and said it was terribly bland. She had to ask for salt and pepper to try and add some flavor. Someone else at our table tried a bite and confirmed it was flavorless. $14 for flavorless mac and cheese. Great! The bill came to $105 and it didn't feel like we overpaid at all other than the extremely generous person who left a tip."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to check out Pedal Haus for quite some time and finally had the opportunity to do so this weekend.  We made a reservation to ensure we wouldn't have to wait for a table and were promptly seated on their great patio.  Service was good, happy hour prices were killer and the food/drink was decent.  I really enjoyed my $5 glasses of wine...a little disappointed that they ran out of cider, but a nice glass of wine will always make up for that.  We tried the pretzel and the brat bites - thumbs up on the pretzel with beer cheese, but thumbs down on the brat bites - tasted like they had been sitting out way too long!  My hubby enjoyed the bacon blue burger and I had a cream of tomato soup - yummy!  This place will definitely make the rotation of our regular drinking stops in Tempe - well done!"}
{"text":"Tough to write because I loved it the first time I went. But my family was visiting and I suggested Pedal Haus because it had something for everyone - seafood, burgers, and good drinks. So we made a reservation for a Friday evening. 

We were seated in the middle of the silo and the music was so loud - my grandparents thought so and even I, a college student, agreed. I literally got a headache. Then our food took an hour to come because of a 30-person party before us. The waitress was super nice and apologetic and the manager came out and said he'd cover our first round of drinks. 

Finally when our food came my family enjoyed theirs but I was disappointed with my lobster mac n cheese - first of all, they gave me bacon mac n cheese which I identified immediately and told the server, who assured me it was lobster. I thought the customer was always right? Anyway, I finally convinced him that it wasn't in fact lobster and they gave me what I ordered. It was soupy and bitter. Not a fan. 

Throughout this my grandparents were very amicable and understanding but it got to a point where we were tired of waiting and HUNGRY. 

We paid for our drinks, the manager ended up paying for our meals (I swear I saw him shaking his head as we walked away), and we tipped the poor waitress well. 

Probably won't return. Sad because I liked it the first time!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The patio is unlike anything else I've seen in Arizona. The beers are great and so is the food. Open up one in Gilbert/Chandler!"}
{"text":"I ate here for a quick meal before heading into a movie next door.  Seeing the only 3.5-star rating, I hesitant to stop in but the convenience won me over.  

There was an Arizona vs. ASU game so the place was packed to the gills with rowdy sports fans.  Luckily, I found a spot at the bar.  This whole place has ample in/outdoor bar seating, regular tables, and cabanas.  

Unhindered by the crowd, a server took our order and got our beers straight away.  For dinner, I ordered the 'fancy burger' which is a mushroom & swiss variety served with thick style fried chips.  The food couldn't have been served much faster than it physically took to cook; service was extremely fast!  The burger and bun were both moist with good flavor; chips were hot and crispy.  Nothing foofoo, just solid pub food.

Complimenting the meal was their in-house, or should I say \"in-haus,\" Bourbon Barrel Aged Quad.  True to quadruple beers, it was on the dark and strong side but not in a distracting way.  Aged in Four Roses barrels, the bourbon flavor really comes through prominently.  This beer quickly became one of my all-time favorites, which drew me to eat there the next day.

The next night I ordered the half rack of ribs.  They are decent-sized pork ribs cooked in Carolina style BBQ and came with a Caesar side salad and mac & cheese.  I am generally not a fan of Carolina style but these ribs and accompanying side sauce had an elegant flavor profile (vs. the cleaning vinegar and cheap mustard tasting sauce I've had at other places).  Mac & cheese fans will enjoy the rich and creamy texture resulting from the use of real cheese here.

Being a brewery, one ought to expect that their primary focus is beer, however the food quality doesn't suffer.  Along with the fast, friendly service, the atmosphere is unique, modern, and fun.  They have plenty of TVs/sports games on and free WiFi to boot.

The only negative was that they don't sell growlers of the bourbon quad, wish they'd reconsider  I recommend this place if you're looking for an unpretentious meal and/or a good place to hang out and watch sports."}
{"text":"This isn't your average brew pub. 
There are outdoor fire pits, games, ping pong, corn hole and more. The Pedal Haus is located next to a multiplex movie theater so it's a great place to go to before or after a movie.
We had a Mediterranean platter to share, salmon, fish and chips and everything was very good. I normally don't care for heavy and greasy pub food but this was lighter, much more thought out and well made. 
I went for the beer sampler, receiving five 4 oz beers and they were all very good. 
Next time we're in town I will definitely stop by the Pedal Haus."}
{"text":"Great Local Craft Brewery Tucked into the heart of Tempe's InFamous Mill Ave. great for after work, mid-day, early lunch. Great staff, and Atmosphere will definitely please locals, and travelers. Check out their seasonal selection, as well as their great brews that gave them their outstanding reputation!!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times with my husband and we absolutely love the margherita pizza and garlic fries. The atmosphere is also very fun and upbeat and it is usually fairly busy. Highly recommend for locals and anyone visiting Tempe!"}
{"text":"So came here because of the Yelp reviews and I wanted to make sure that I ate at a place that had good reviews. 

As I walked in, I saw a cool outdoor patio area where you can have a circular booth with friends and have a conversation or regular tables. The cool thing was that the had the mister going on outside since it was really hot. 


So I got the Bière Blanche since it's local and went with the Falafel Burger. Let me take a few bites and let you know how it went .......

Garlic fries were a great addition to the burger and the fries didn't taste like you could get them just at any store. I was surprised by the taste of the Falafel Burger and it was pretty amazing. The condiments and garnishment was on point. 5 stars for the hostess, the waitress, the food and the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service was horrible, server had left for the night without telling us she was transferring our table, never came back to ask if we wanted another round. BEER WAS DECENT. Honestly server ruined my experience."}
{"text":"Excellent, service was great, the experience was incredible, pizza is really good with fresh ingredients, suggest the side of green beens  with bacon and onions,  incredible!!! The patio rocks with great music at a perfect volume, we'll be back..."}
{"text":"First off.........what cool looking place. Hands down the most beautiful in downtown Tempe.
I'm totally coming back here to day drink.
2nd.......Beer is legit. I had a couple IPA's that were on the menu.
Apps.......had the cheese curds......THE BOMB
Lastly the food. Mom said the cheese burger was great. She usually only eats half, then takes the other half home.......she killed it.  I had the cuban, the recommendation from the waitress......it was ok. I wasn't wow'd. I will totally be back!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice location with plenty of room. You can definitely smell that there's a brewery on site. The smell of malted grain was pretty overwhelming. Decent beer selection with only a few of their own at this point. Limited menu, but we only tried a few starters since we were there for happy hour. $2 off beers and appetizers is the deal. Friendly staff, but seemed pretty inexperienced and goofed on a few things. Beer list does not give abv or indicate if the pour is 10 oz or a pint. Need to correct this. This place has potential, but seems to going through som e growing pains."}
{"text":"Pedal Haus Brewery is a large and modern brewery and restaurant located in downtown Tempe near the AMC theater. This restaurant sells a combination of their own beer, guest taps, and several full bars. Parking is not available at the restaurant, but there are several garages in the area and using Lyft is probably a better option.

We were here for my 20th high school reunion and dominated the back patio with over 100 guests. The layout of the brewery is a bit odd with several indoor rooms and patio style rooms that are both inside and outside. Nestled among the dining areas are the brewing equipment and a large pizza oven.

Our group was treated to a heavy appetizer buffet including sliders, pasta dishes, and house made potato chips. The menu seems to be standard pub food dominated by typical dishes like burgers, pizza, and mac and cheese. The food was decent, although I may have chosen more aggressive items if it was not catered.

As you would expect, the drinks were flowing. I sampled a few of their house beers which were good. The guest taps were a bit more interesting with different styles. The mixed drinks were pretty typical, but I have sympathy for the bartenders dealing with dozens of guests more interested in the last 20 years than their drink orders.

The overall feel is sort of eclectic and modern hipster with a sprawling location. Pedal Haus is a decent place to take a large group as they can cater to a broad range of tastes. The location is great, especially for visiting ASU parents or even locals looking to meet up with new friends."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: I think this establishment is gorgeous!  

Food: haven't tried yet

Drinks: Great!

Service: GREAT! Friendly and even waited to hold the door open for me if I was walking in or out of the patio area. 

Dog Friendly!!!!!!

I popped in here for a drink the other day while waiting for my friend to join me for a movie.  I really enjoyed myself.  The bartender was very personable, which was great because I was temp. alone.  He told me that the patio is dog friendly, and they are working on a menu for the pups!  Being a Dogmom & in the pet industry, this made me very excited and look forward to coming back with my pups."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Can get crazy busy. But bartenders are awesome. Great selection of beers and wines. Check out shuffle board, ping pong or corn hole. Great diverse crowd!"}
{"text":"It is a five star any night but a busy night. Even then a busy night is still great service. Food takes a bit longer as does the bar but nothing out of the normal for mill. It does get crowded even though they have tons of room. Would still go even if it is busy night. Atmosphere is top notch."}
{"text":"We hosted our High School Reunion for 150+ people at Pedal Haus this weekend and it was kick ass (as we said in the 80's)!  Cheri helped us organize everything and Nick the manager was on top of things all evening!  The space was perfect with a great bar area, about 10 long picnic style tables, buffet in the back with additional cocktail tables, a gaming area with corn hole, ping pong tables, and beer pong!  We even had two large cabanas with fire pits and beach chairs.  Plenty of room to spread out!  I love that they helped set up 80's music for us from a Spotify play list and had our photos playing on multiple tv's hung from ceiling.  It was the best!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time the other night and was pleased to see they had Huss Brewery Koffee Kolsch on the menu...yum! Menu was limited but enjoyed the guacamole platter and chicken pot pie. Cody was a super nice server :) So we left our wallet there and two hours later realized it and went back to find that not only had they found it but they stored it in a safe place and verified identity before giving it back with everything still in it...phew! Highly recommended for beer selection, atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"We got seated at a table and immediately our waiter complained to us about how the last couple sat at one of his 6-tops for an hour and only ordered 1 beer. After our beer order got taken within 10 minutes we had to wait 20 minutes before our waiter returned...after us asking another waiter to get him. Our waiter, when he returned told us that he would \"be right back.\"

While taking our food order I asked if the Pretzel and Cheese appetizer would come out sooner than the entree and he said he could get it out right away. After 15 minutes passed without him returning we waved him down to ask for an ETA on the food and he responded with \"the kitchens too far to go check.\" Another 5 minutes passed and we waved him down again...he said \"our kitchens getting shit on I can't really tell you when the food will come out.\"

A few minutes later he brought me a cold pretzel and cheese which led me to believe he was just too lazy to get it from the kitchen that was \"too far\" when it was ready.

At this point I cancelled my entree order, paid my tab and left. I honestly regret paying ~$9 for my beer and cold appetizer and regret tipping the waiter $.50. 

He was an awful waiter and it was an overall awful experience. If management reads this: he was wearing a green tank top on St Pattys Day around 9pm and working the outside area. Firing him would improve your business."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with our waitress Allison's service tonight! It took her 10-15min to greet my table once we were sat. On top of that, we were there for 2 hours and she came to check in on us 3 times, 2 of those times I had to track her down. 

As I spoke to the manager, he advised he was short staffed. However, Allison checked in on the tables around my table plenty of times. Once I got the manager involved Allison's demeanor changed and the attitude came out! 

We did not get an apology for the bad service out of Allison's mouth nor a thank you after she dropped off the bill. 

Thanks for my first visit at the Pedal!"}
{"text":"Currently sitting at the bar where I was waiting to order food, only to be informed that the kitchen closed early, therefore I was not able to order anything. New place so I know they need to work out the kinks, but the service indeed sucks. Probably won't be back, I'll stick to Fox restaurants, they never fail."}
{"text":"the atmosphere and TV setup is great.  football everywhere.  It's very dog friendly and they provide water and a bowl for your pet.  
Groupons aren't good on Sundays because it's happy hour all day. 
The beers were average.  The IPA'S had a strong aftertaste without much flavor. They were smooth but tasteless.  The amber was the best beer in the flight and we prefer IPAs.  Sadly the mojito was better than the beer."}
{"text":"Amazing food along with the fantastic plating makes for an extra special dining experience. The beer list is extensive and perfect for craft beer lovers. Pedal house is perfect for an afternoon meal as well as a fun night out with all your friends. You could say I'm somewhat of a buffalo wing connoisseur and the wings here are with out a doubt the best I have ever had. They are seasoned in such a way that they don't even need the amazing house made buffalo sauce but then again the buffalo sauce is so good you have to have it with your wing. They have the perfect crisp on the outside and the meat is super tender and juicy! I rarely use the side of ranch always provided with an order of wings but even that is delectable. To top it all off the celery salad is a great new take on the veggies you usually get with wings. For a main course you must have the chefs cut steak... The best steak I have ever had is not an over exaggeration! Just think of the steak of you're dreams and that's what I ate. This place rules."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar closest to the main entry.  I was able to quickly place my order, but prior to receiving my Kolsch the bartender asked for a card to hold and before even waiting for a response he was off.  When I received my beer is was asked again for a card, but once again he left before I could respond.  My beer was at least 1 1/8\" below full upon arrival.  At first I thought ok maybe they serve all of their beers not quite full, but then the person three bar stools to my right got a completely full beer.  A short time later my side arrived (Brussels and Bacon) and for a third time I was asked for a card at which time I held up my $20 since I intended to pay with cash.  The bartender took my cash and vanished yet again returning with a cash drawer to add to his register.  While he was gone I experienced very over cooked mildly burnt dry Brussels and almost no bacon or bacon flavor.  The bartender then returned with my change (He gave me two 5's and a single) 11 bucks change from a twenty and dropped of the receipt which showed a total including tax of $10.81, so I did a double take and discovered I was undercharged.  I got his attention and showed him the receipt and the change; he thanked me for being honest and pointing it out.  He disappears again to get the \"right change\" only to return with a five spot and four singles I know it's only .19 but damn get it right.  Long story short the BEER was descent the FOOD was horrible and be prepared to give them a card or cash right away.  If you do pay in cash don't expect the change to be correct."}
{"text":"Would've given this zero stars if I could. Absolutely HORRIBLE service. We had a waitress bring us one drink and an appetizer after 30 mins. Then she came up and told us she was leaving so we needed to close our tab with her and she would be sending us a new server. We sat for 1 hour without a server. We then gave up and went to the bar only for her to tell us that the kitchen was now closed. Worst service I have ever had and I will NOT be returning. Do not go here."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience at the Pedal Haus Brewery. Being from the Midwest, we thought it would be fun to actually sit inside a silo to eat. We were greeted right away by our friendly server and did not have to wait long in between getting our great tasting micro brews and our food order. The wings and fried pickles were fantastic and come highly recommended!   The atmosphere and vibe of the place is very modern rustic!"}
{"text":"Pilsner was solid. Maple milk stout was a sweeter Guinness, not my style. Got the bacon blue cheese burger medium. Over cooked, tasted the burnt parts on the meat, no juiciness. Asparagus side was delicious only thing worth my money $5. Sat at the bar on a Thursday early evening not busy at all with poor attention and service. WOB was way better with service."}
{"text":"I am not exactly what changed in the last renovation of Pedal Haus but on my last trip (August 2017) the food was substantially better. This may have been the best fried fish I have had in town, the oil was obviously fresh - the biggest problem with good fried fish - and the temperature right. The deviled egg dip was a first for me. It rocked my socks but there has to be something better than chips for that...maybe some old school homemade Melba toast is in order. Here's to hoping the improved evening wasn't a fluke!"}
{"text":"This is a chill new brewery type place.... For one its huge! The three times I've been here I've never had a wait, even when mill is super busy. The location is super convenient for whatever you're doing, especially since it's right next to the movies... The beer list is solid, had no trouble finding good drafts.

Buttttttt there's nothing that blows me away about the place. The menu is a little confusing... It's kinda of trying To be bar food but then also has pasta and a few other random things, don't quite get itttt?

It's kinda like they don't know what they're doing.... It's like part brewery, part trendy restaurant, and part sports bar. I think they gotta pick one! If they're trying to be a sports bar they def have to get more tvs for this huge space !"}
{"text":"After my cousin who worked at Pedal Haus as a brewer, passed away suddenly in a motorcycle accident, Pedal Haus had a celebration of life for him after the funeral with free food for his family and loved ones. They were so generous to our family and I do not know how we could than them. This establishment is truly extraordinary I recommend it to anyone interested."}
{"text":"The pot pie was amazing! It was nice going to a brew pub that had elevated pub food. A must try!"}
{"text":"Friends really like this place, so I was excited to try.  Patio looks very cool, but we sat inside due to the heat.  Poor service, and then kitchen screwed up my dish.  Would give it a try again given the manager comped my meal."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is legit - modern & fun. Food was pretty good & their cocktails were creative & worth the charge. Staff has been pretty friendly & there is plenty of space. Very trendy & cool. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Beer selection was noteworthy, the atmosphere was great (indoor/outdoor seating), the clientele was eclectic, ranging in all ages, and all food I tried was exceptional. The ghost pepper cheesesteak was likely the best cheesesteak I have ever experienced. Yes, it is hot, but not as hot as the name would lead you to believe. I will eat here every time in Tempe."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere! Highly recommend the open faced ham and cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"First off this is a beautiful space! It's large and spacious, has two bars, and a huge outdoor patio!
Service could be better as at times the BT's seem to forget about you, but not horribly so!
I did not eat here so I cannot speak for the food, but it looked good coming out of the kitchen!
As for the beers I tried all 13 and I will say they are all well made and pretty true to style!
The chili beer, the maple milk stout, and the dortmunder were standouts! The IPA was good as well!
I highly recommend this place, great atmosphere, awesome location, and solid beer!"}
{"text":"Was planning on having a special event here and the owner backed out last minute on us causing us to make other plans. Please consider other places if you don't want to be disappointed"}
{"text":"Great night at Pedal Haus. Super busy because of the game but good service. And the new English Pub Ale is amazing. You have to try it."}
{"text":"I went to Pedal Haus despite several of my friends telling me not to. The food was not horrible but it wasn't very good either. It was under seasoned and bland.
The service was good in the beginning but once we were seated, we ordered drinks and waited... and waited.. and waited. You would think that when the food comes, they would notice you didn't get your drinks.
This problem didn't seem to be unique to us because the table next to us was grumbling about it as well.

I can deal with poor service and average food but the big problem was how dirty it was. I just can't imagine what the condition of the kitchen was if they allow their dining area to be so poorly kept. 

I hope no one gets sick :(

There is too much competition out there to put up with inferior standards."}
{"text":"Went to Pedal House for the first time last night and I am a fan! We were there for happy hour which runs from 3PM - 6PM Monday - Friday (check-in on Facebook for an additional half hour - score!). My husband and I split three appetizers which were each $2 off (beer is also $2 off for happy hour). We ordered the fried cheese curds (you MUST get these - omg), the soft pretzel (deliciously salty) and the buffalo wings (also great). I had the IPA which I will definitely get again the next time we go back. It wasn't overbearingly hoppy to me and smooth for an IPA. My husband also got the Big Boots which he enjoyed. The color has a pink hue to it which I've never seen before. Pretty cool. I tried it and was expecting it to taste more sour since it's classified that way. So if you don't traditionally like sour beers you may still enjoy this one. Really looking forward to going back and trying more of their great in-house (or should I say \"in-haus\" ;)) brewed beer and yummy food."}
{"text":"Dominic is a wonderful and experienced server. He is also very patient and willing to accommodate large parties! We had a great time at pedal house."}
{"text":"I was in town for a few days and was lucky enough to come across this awesome place with a great atmosphere friendly people and the bartenders were all the absolute best.  Their in house brews are all very well done. I am a slight beer snob from Colorado so i was very happy to find this place. Also you absolutely have to try the mussels and fries with your beer of choice... And don't forget the straw!!"}
{"text":"Amazing design and feel. Great beer selection and quality house brew. Food was high quality and delicious. Great date night dinner or place to take a group and have fun!"}
{"text":"Great venue and beer selection. We did not try food, but the food that was being served looked great. The light larger is crisp and light. The podelhost, not sure on spelling was a great Kolsch style beer. Pricing is good too at $5. We will definitely make this a regular stop while on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"Stopped into Pedal Haus for the first time this Thursday night. My husband and I were going to a movie and were surprised by the size of the place. The restaurant is beautiful! We sat at the bar and the two male bartenders were very awesome. They greeted us and taught us all about their beer. We were allowed to sample, which is always nice. I drank the Maple Milk Stout and my husband had the Weizen. Both were fantastic! We were sad we had to leave for the movie between the amazing service and the even better beer we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After ASU graduation we reserved two areas and was impressed with service and selection on food and beer. All our San Diego were extremely pleased."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Sunday evening with friends. Each of our tips were OVERCHARGED by double the amount. Two of my friends got extra charges on their cards for $16-$20.  The manager says he will refund, but really had no explanation. CHECK YOUR BILL if go here."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and beer. Large portions for the price. On the outside they have bar games (bag toss and ping pong). They do have misters going do it's not too bad put but definitely warmer than I'd like. The servers have been very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Found one of my new favorite breweries in the East Valley. There is a lot to like about this place. First, is the space itself. There is a huge outdoor seating area and Biergarten (ping pong, bags, etc...), and many broken up indoor spaces for both small and large groups. The private seating next to the tanks looks like a very cool spot for a group of 10-20. The menu had many items that caught my eye. I opted for the friend pickles (both rounds and spears- the best of both worlds) and a Reuben (so as to avoid the mid afternoon burger coma.) Food tasted great, especially when paired with some great beers. I had their Oktoberfest (tis the season), and the double IPA (very good.) Our service was very good, although I bet they get tested when the brewery fills up at night. I am already looking forward to another trip to Pedal Haus, maybe by bike next time!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Fire pits, ping pong,corn hole, TV's everywhere that there's not a bad seat in the place, good food and great drinks too! This is definitely my go to place on Mill moving forward."}
{"text":"This place is pretty nifty and has one of my favorite brews on tap (can't remember the name off the top of my head). The staff is pretty friendly and the layout is pretty jammin. You should check it out. Also, make sure you park in the parking garage they validate (don't remember the name right now)."}
{"text":"I don't get to Tempe very often but I'm glad I made it to this spot last weekend. Pedal Haus Brewery is a local microbrewery that also features outside brews. The space itself is very open and inviting. It's getting a bit too toasty for patio seating but their patio looks amazing! 

I ordered the Rose Royale {Hendricks Gin | Haus  made sweet & sour | fresh raspberries | Champagne} it was the perfect refresher after an hour of paddle boarding on the lake. For an appetizer we went with the nachos and holy moly they are HUGE! So big I actually thought about cancelling my main course. Honestly, these were some of the best nachos ever! I consider myself a nacho connoisseur (seriously it should be on my resume). These do not disappoint! The generous toppings of chicken chili verde, black beans, corn, queso, pickled Fresno peppers, and lime crema made it almost impossible to stop eating. I showed a little more restraint and ordered the Haus Salad composed of mixed greens, tomato, cucumber, red onion, feta, and balsamic vinaigrette. Pretty standard but still good. As always I could use more feta. I also was able to try a bite of the green chili bacon burger. It was much more satisfying than my salad! I don't normally order burgers but I would consider it here! The green chili and Jack cheese combo was to die for! 

Service was ok. At first it was really quick and efficient but toward the end we found ourselves waiting for the check for a good 10-15 min. That was my only gripe. If I find myself in the area again i would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and their beer selection is top notch. I like this place for just hanging out with good food and good company. An underrated Tempe gem."}
{"text":"As other reviewers have mentioned, this place is huge.  They actually have three bar areas and a large outside patio in addition to the main dining area.

I sat at the bar and the service was very good.  The cheddar burger with fries was satisfactory but I'll probably try something different on my next visit.

I think they are still working on their beer list.  They didn't have any of their own beers and the big craft brewers like Sierra Nevada, Four Peaks and I believe it was New Belgium dominated the tap list.  I did like my Dragoon IPA and hope they continue to broaden their offerings with smaller unique brewers."}
{"text":"I felt like a turkey when I walked in cause I did not know this was a Brewery. I had the PedalHaus Dubbel, which was remarkably balanced and smooth... like dangerously smooth! I paired it with the Mac n cheese, which was so creamy I wanted to dance the night away with it. 

The layout is fantastically huge! I love the patio and look forward to returning with my cycling buddies for our bike and beer rides. The staff was very attentive and nice. I give it a 4 because the burgers will determine if I raise it to a 5. But the Poutine my friend let me grab a bite of was out of this world! The flavor profiles for the items were on point! Plus they have an open kitchen, which I love, love, LOVE!!!"}
{"text":"Chicken fingers are amazing!! Very sad to see that they took cheese curds off the menu  but I guess life goes on"}
{"text":"Pedal haus is a solid place to grab a couple beers and a snack before hitting up the movie theater next door. Their wings are very very good! I like that they have their beers but offer a few other options from other breweries. I will say that the quality of the home brews has drastically improved since first opening, and they have a pretty fantastic trippel."}
{"text":"We stopped here for drinks part-way through our long bike ride.     There was a place to park the bikes where we could see them while we sat in the outdoor bar area.  Mid-afternoon the place was quite busy.   The interior is modern and industrial.     The food looked good - will come back to try it another time."}
{"text":"I tripped across this place last night and since I'm an avid biker I had to give it a try.  Service was outstanding from the hostess desk to my server Nick to the manager that checked in on me.  They are operating under a soft opening right now but will be kicking it off on Friday 9/25. I'm an avid beer fan and they did not disappoint, great selection to choose from, they do not have their own beers yet, but they are getting close.  Just to call out a couple of local breweries I had the Count Hopula a blood red IPA from San Tan Brewing and I had the White Russian Imperial Stout from Sun Up Brewing.  Both were excellent and the stout is up there as one of my favorites for that style.  Last, the food - they have a basic but solid menu right now that will expand - I had the Mussels & Frites dish; awesome, may be the best mussels I've ever had, for sure they were the meatiest ones.  Give this place a try I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun! Tons of space, full bar, extensive menu and lots of patio games. Great place for hanging out with a big group and heaters in the patio for cold nights. Great service, very attentive staff."}
{"text":"This place is really cool. The decor is really tasteful and interesting. The patio outside is comfortable and fun. The food is great. I had a good Reuben, my wife had a great salad, and my mother in law had some really tasty fish and chips (we share food in our family ). This place has tons of great beer-- I had a tasty IPA. And it's in a super rad location. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Just had a great meal on the patio at pedal haus.  Our server aubree recommended the wings, tempura bratwurst, and my favorite the beef carpaccio. Everything was great. Very spacious and comfortable patio, nice crowd, good music, killer vibe. Can't wait till my next visit!"}
{"text":"My son and his new wife had a wedding reception dinner here 2 weeks ago and it was beautiful.  The staff was nice and attentive. We had a delicious buffet dinner. Their private room with family style table and benches accommodated our party of 25 easily.  I am not a big fan of breweries so I was very pleased to have the server suggest a few cocktails.  Hoping to go back soon to enjoy more of the pretzel and cheese appetizer. Also having the parking garage nearby was a plus ++."}
{"text":"Nice patio area.  Service, food, and beers were all good.  I had the chicken strip dinner and the strips were well cooked and the sauce was interesting and good."}
{"text":"Atmosphere here is really awesome. I went on a Monday afternoon so it wasn't crazy packed. We had the best service. They have a great beer selection,and their own beer is pretty good. I'm not a fan of Amber beers but pedal haus changed my mind. The food menu consists of comfort foods(burgers,wings,pot pie).Closest parking in in a paid structure but it was only $7 for several hours. If you're concerned about that,just park down the street."}
{"text":"What a neat place! Wish it hadn't been so cold the night we came, probably would've sat outside, although they do have heaters so maybe next time we'll try it! The food was delicious, ate mostly wings and drank beer obviously! They don't have a huge selection of food but I think most people come here for the beer. Fun place, we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Such a cute brewery! They have multiple fire pits, lounge areas and beer pong. When you don't feel like having people over at your house but want to get together, this is the spot. Great drinks of course but don't smoke close the the out side bar lol."}
{"text":"Decided to go here last minute with some friends before going to the movies. From the outside, this place is a powerhouse. It's huge! There's a large outdoor patio and also a nice indoor seating area. When we walked in we were greeted and seated in the back. We got our drink orders in quickly (we all opted for the pedal hause beers). They arrived quickly. I got the nitro and it was honestly bland and flat. Would not recommend. 

When we went to order our food we were informed that 2 of the 4 burgers were no longer available (8pm on a Saturday night). Considering the menu was pretty small, it was disappointing. I ordered the chicken pot pie. I figured it must be the signature dish bc it had a spot all on its own on the menu. My friends ordered the steak frites, and mushroom and asparagus pasta. My vegetarian friend was disappointed w the lack of options. Literally salad or the pasta. She asked if they had any veggie burgers and the waitress said they have turkey burgers at lunch. It seems weird that in 2015 restaurants (especially in a liberal college town) don't carry veggie patties as a burger alternative.

That being said, all of our food was delicious. My pot pie was crisp and fluffy on top with warm highly seasoned chickeny goodness inside. I totally get why it has its own place on the menu. I gave their in house brews another try with the porterhause. Perfect dark beer, they redeemed themselves.

All in all I would definitely come back. It's a festive, quick, and convenient place w pretty yummy food. They had a big apps menu that I would love to try next time."}
{"text":"Had the burger and slaw. Basic food, nothing special. Great location and atmosphere. A little louder than I cared for. If you park at centerpoint you will have to pay for parking. However, they validate parking if you park at the brickyard."}
{"text":"Food better than expected.  Pleasantly surprised.  Reasonable pricing.  Great outdoor area.  Would have given 4 stars if they validated for parking.  Big negative and a reason I stay away from downtown Tempe!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I stopped by today for lunch at Pedal Haus. Read that Tuesday was taco specials....$2.00. Sounded like a good deal, so drove across town to check it out for the first time. \"No. No specials.\"Do you have tacos? Yes but No,.... ran out of fish.
Sat down and ordered lunch. \"We need your credit card before you can order.\"
What??? Just in case I skip out? I can assure you I am 40+ years from being a college student....not that that should matter.
I felt this was rude and assuming I was a deadbeat? If so.....that's your problem....not mine.
Goodbye.....here's $ for the diet soda.
Will not be by again."}
{"text":"Ok Ok I finally made it back to Pedal Hause!

On my last review  I exclaimed it Haus to get better... It did

It was happy hour just prior to a movie and then just after, so that says a lot. On my original visit I never looked back. On my last visit I made a bee-line to get back!

As reviewed the place is massive and gleaming, it's a beautifully designed place from front door to back patio and in-between.

After tasting the Hause Brews I'm hooked, Its a wonderful selection from top to bottom. Only one other brewery has it covered this well. ( I wont say who, but it's not 4pks) I especially like the Belgian Dubble, It's Marvelous it really is!!!

Service was great but not personal, she served us and left us alone. Our tender did ask about our day and that's important from a happy hour bartender. 

No food was ordered but after perusing the menu I will be back. I did notice the burgers started at $13.00 ea so that set the tone, but the mussels look good, and I almost always get \"the beer munchies\"

The paper menus/ lists are still a mess, but when everything else goes great it's easy to overlook.

I think they found there stride, and $3  excellent Haus Brews at happy hour are my best reason to return!!! 

*follow up visit and review as promised."}
{"text":"I give two stars because at least the hostess was gracious enough to seat our party. We came in today and after being seated for 15 min with no server coming to our table we became a bit impatient. With it being chilly & being seated outside we waved down a male server to receive assistance with the heat lamp, his response was \"Not right now\" and he stormed off. Currently working as a server I can tell you they weren't even close to being too busy to help us, and having dinner with them before the mediocre food was barely enough to bring us back, with the now rude behavior from their servers we will not return. Sad."}
{"text":"Top tier facility with varied seating options and pleasantly tasty food (fried chicken and pretzels with spicy mustard) make this Tempe gem worth multiple visits"}
{"text":"My husband and I loved the atmosphere of Pedal Haus. So many places to sit, fire pits, open air, outside seating, cool atmosphere with the brewery feel. Menu was great, lots of options for food and drinks. Cute little area in Tempe to walk around after your meal or you can stay and play the hard games Pedal Haus provides. So fun!"}
{"text":"I sooo wanted to love this place. Like, I really, really wanted to love this place!  When we walked up my husband said, great looking place! Nice find! He is not easy to please, so this was great. That was the end of falling in love with Pedal Haus. We took our dog because it's dog friendly.  We were greeted warmly and told to sit anywhere. The minute we sat down, a very unfriendly woman came over and told us to move because only a designated area of the patio is for dogs.  I apologized and explained we'd been told to sit anywhere (as we were already moving) and she simply repeated herself and walked away.  Our server came fairly quickly and was nice enough.  We ordered two burgers and said we'd wait for happy hour to order beers (we also wanted to order an app but thought we'd wait on that, too, since they were on special).  Our burgers took 25-30 minutes!  Happy hour started in the middle of that, but our server was MIA so we couldn't put our order in for beers/apps.  When our burgers finally came out, they were pretty much rare.  I had ordered mine Med-Med Well and it was RED.  My husband ordered his medium and it was pink all the way throughout.  The buns were cold (I assume they are served that way, but not my preference). Because we were starving at this point, we didn't complain about the burgers and ordered wings and a beer. The wings came out in about 2 minutes. I kid you not.  Almost a half an hour for burgers that weren't even cooked, and yet the wings in 2 minutes. Well, that's because they weren't cooked, either! They were cold, and clearly not cooked in the sauce, but rather the sauce thrown over top.  Again, I suppose that is how they serve them here, but definitely not my preference. No taste whatsover, and cold.  The side salad I got in place of fries was a few pieces of lettuce with a 2 cucumbers and 2 radish slices. Odd.  We were already so annoyed and disappointed in our experience, that I wasn't about to pay for wings we couldn't/wouldn't eat.  I let the server know and she was very apologetic.  Our service was kind, but clearly overworked in a completely different section (since we were way in the dog area of the \"dog friendly\" patio) and therefore not attentive.  Throughout this entire time there was someone there who I assume was a manager because he had a \"uniform\" on but wasn't waiting tables. He was standing around the entire time and never helping his server or checking in. Class act.  I took pictures of the burgers so you know I'm not exaggerating, but they are on my husband's phone and honestly they are just plain gross. As I'm reviewing this, I can't believe we ate them. :(  Oh...and no parking validation, either."}
{"text":"Didn't have the chance to try the food or drinks. We sat in the bar area on a non-busy Sunday afternoon. Waited for 20 mins and no one came by with menus or water. Deuces!"}
{"text":"Great bar awesome beer and yummy food.
Sat at the bar and enjoyed great service and one of the best burgers I've had in years. Beer was perfect. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The waitress wouldn't accept my ID the same one that was issued to me to when I moved back to Arizona. I'm 25 work in old town scottsdale and have been out in old town and mill without being questioned. The second lady came over and asked if I had another form of ID to which I don't seeing as how that's my drivers license in question. I put my phone down which some how translated into me throwing my phone and her asking us to leave. The last person we encountered (an older guy) came over heated and without question accused me of being disorderly and kicking us out. He asked for my ID walked away and returned with a nicer attitude and said that my ID was valid and we were ok stay. Needless to say we were more than ready to leave this establishment and go to the yard. Better vibe and more pleasant employees."}
{"text":"Here for Friends/Family training night! This is gonna be big. Industrial look all around, steel, aluminum finishes with accents of wood and walls of light brick. High ceiling, plenty of bar seating too. High end menu with trout, salmon, and a fun chicken thighs dish too! Opening around September 25th. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Overall a cool industrial environment. Large inside and a nice patio. Definitely not a place for a wine drinker--minimal  selection and high prices. As is becoming the norm, the music is so loud it is difficult to have a conversation. Probably won't be back solely based on that. 
On a side note, as we sat at the bar we watched our bartender sweep the floor behind the bar. After handling the dirty dust pan, he went right back to filling orders without washing his hands. Pretty big yuk factor!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the outside bar.  Staff super friendly!  Had a Raspberry Mojito and the hummus with tortilla chips instead of pita chips!  Will go back!"}
{"text":"This is a nice, trendy place. The ambiance is typical of a brewery (industrial, steam punk, modern).  The noise level on a Saturday night was not too bad and a nice conversation was possible.  The crowd was surprisingly not all ASU students, and in fact, there was a good mix of age groups.  There is a nice patio plus indoor seating.

One other thing I should mention about Saturday nights here--they offer a Saturday happy hour until 6:30pm.  That's a nice perk considering most places in the Mill Ave. area don't offer weekend happy hours. 

The beers and the food were excellent.  I had the half beer can chicken and it was done perfectly.  I can't wait to go back as there were several more beers  and entrees I want to try."}
{"text":"I am updating my review below based on Nick the managers timely response to my concern below.  Very responsive and I really appreciate it.  Thanks Nick!  


We were seeing a movie next door so decided to visit this restaurant on Fathers Day before heading next door to AMC.  We asked to sit on the patio so our kids could play corn hole and ping pong.  We were told that unfortunately no kids are allowed to play corn hole and ping pong.  We asked why and were told it's adults only 21+ in that portion of the restaurant.  We said okay and ate our lunch which was good.  Went to see the movie and upon walking by the ping pong/corn hole area on our way back to the car we are tons of kids playing corn hole and ping pong.  What the heck?  One and done at this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic beers. It's wonderful to find a brewery that isn't heavy on hops. The triple is the best I've found outside of Belgium. The quad is fantastic. I am excited to try whatever they brew up next."}
{"text":"This place has a really cool set up and good music, but both mine and my friends pizza came out burnt and I had to wait 20 min for a water refill when servers would would pass right by my empty cup at the end of the table and never refilled it once, server came back and said \"sorry\" when I could see her talking to other servers and taking care of other tables. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Management needs to learn to control the crowd. Yes, it's a brewery but the drunk fools screaming at the NFL game (literally) 10 ft from wherever sat for dinner on a Sunday night sucked. No one cut them off or told them to chill. Plus, BLASTING the game is great but commercials too??? Rookie manager mistake."}
{"text":"Service was beyond friendly and prompt, food was exquisite and well presented.  Atmosphere was electric, even for us retired folks.   So many good things on the menus we'll definitely be going back to try some more.  Great experience - even on a busy game night/Octoberfest night, we only waited 20 minutes.  Lots of options here - highly recommend it as a place to take company (if you like a pub experience)!"}
{"text":"Except for actually having to pedal to get here, I love this place, Great atmosphere and food in a great building, Met some business friends to talk business and got lost in our beers. Also tried some good food. Had my first cheese curd fries, interesting. Had the IPA and maybe tried a second, Good you can't park nearby because you will not be driving home. Wings were really good, I will get them again if I am ever pedalling in the area...."}
{"text":"Ordered a salad with roasted chicken. When the food came out I noticed only three small slivers of chicken were in the meal. After taking a bite I realized the chicken was cold with 85% fat. To top it off the chicken wasn't even cooked."}
{"text":"As far as the atmosphere goes, it's a fun spot to hang out with friends.  The patio is very large though it does feel cramped since the remodel, especially the beer garden area.  Also, you'd figure with such a huge investment they'd throw in a couple of misters or some working fans to the patio to cool it off but you'd be wrong.  I'll definitely come back to hang out but not if the daytime high breaks 80.  

The selection of beers is good, the service is a disaster.  I don't blame the servers or bartenders.  I've had way too many at this place at this point for it to be bad luck.  There must be poor training or understaffing issues.  

The food is very good.  Everything I've had has been on point."}
{"text":"The beer was good,  ok.  The brats weren't anything impressive in my opinion.  More a page to have good beer,  than to have food."}
{"text":"First time here.  It's the Tempe Arts festival weekend so the place is a little crazy.  Good beer and food but service was a little slow.  However,  we weren't in a hurry. Want to come back. Love the setting."}
{"text":"Wonderful Wit!  I was delighted by the flavor of their own microbrew.  Light, well rounded flavor and one I will return to enjoy.  Staff was very friendly especially the gentleman behind the bar who shared brew information with me based on my preferences and Ashley our server.  I liked the atmosphere, but just a nit...I would like the music just a touch lower.  Conversations tended to go louder because of it.  I would also implore the chef to add some good old fashioned bar food to the menu and price them reasonably.  I am not much of a foodie so we tried the cheese board.  It was very good and I loved the jam/preserves with the cheese and bread.  Loved the placement of televisions for the sporting event viewing. Oh and did I mention happy hour every day from 3-6?  That is outstanding!"}
{"text":"I've been here for over an hour and can't seem to get any type of service...not busy, no wait! I've had to ask 3 times for someone to come take a food order! What the hell is going on? So ridiculous...horrible"}
{"text":"Needed some quick food before a movie and decided to give it a try. We ordered the chicken fingers with fries and coleslaw. The tenders were very good along with the fries, but the coleslaw was too dry for my liking. The service was prompt and appreciated. I like the idea of the sinks outside the restroom. That way, those who don't normally wash their hands are shamed into doing it. Good job."}
{"text":"Great beer, good service, very good food. Add in a cool atmosphere and killer patio and this is a great spot for dinner or to watch a game."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Very expensive for a brewery. Good happy hour drink specials and outdoor atmosphere. Service was very slow so make sure you have a few hours to kill."}
{"text":"Great food- great atmosphere- but the ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE on Mill ave. Pick a restaurant up and down the street and any of them has better service than this place. Just awful. Water, drinks, food, the check... every part of the restaurant experience takes an excruciating amount of time. 20+ min. each time. And even the most minute asks are often forgotten. No matter what the ask. And trust me, I've been back over a half-dozen times because it's a cool spot, in a great location. But the service has been terrible during each visit. Worst in town I can assure you."}
{"text":"Ok first three good, gorgeous place, then it stops.. ordered chardonnay and a guest can of beer. Got a moscato and the beer was super warm.  I watched them pull from the fridge so it is the fridge not rotation.. no worries ordered a glass of ice to cool my beer I got a glass of ice water.. OK not letting this ruin my night, ordered lobster Mac cheese appetizer.  After 30 minutes I asked if the order was placed.  Bartender said yes he'd go check. 2 minutes later kitchen brings it out.  Slams it down I say thank you. No comment I say thank you again and she walks away.. Umm yeah too many places on mill, I'll take my $$ elsewhere.."}
{"text":"Another review on a local brewery. Man Phoenix is really blowing up with breweries and I'm happy to see Pedal Haus being added to the mix. Not what I expected at all when I was told that a new brewery opened up on Mill ave. when I walked in I saw that the inside was very modern yet somehow kept an old school classic look. Really hard to do but PH pulled it off. What really sets this place apart is their massive beer garden/patio. Definitely one of the best patios in Phx. They have plenty of sitting areas and TVs and a nice cornhole/latter ball area and a large bar and even a smaller one towards the end of the patio. I came on a chilly day (60 degrees.lol) and they had heat lamps going as well as a very large propane outdoor fireplace with large benches to sit and enjoy your drink. Was really neat sitting so close to the open flames. 

Their beer really doesn't suit my craft beer taste but I did like their guest draft list. I hope they start brewing some IPAs and more hoppy beers but that my preference. They look like they are into breweries German style beers but from the taste I had they were good. 

Overall this place is really cool and a great addition to Mill ave. I really fell in love with the patio and would come here just for a drink to see it. Plus the patio is dog friendly and that gets an extra bonus star just for that!"}
{"text":"Pedal Haus' patio is lit and the place always seems hopping--whenever we go to the nearby movie theater we always make a mental note to stop in. But when we finally did, the food was pretty mediocre. The reuben sandwich had pretty tough meat and the chicken fingers tasted like bar food, but on the pricy side for what you're getting. We also found the service mediocre. We figured maybe they were having a bad night and went back. second time for food and drinks with friends, but had the same experience. Mediocre, overpriced bar food, not a great beer selection (they were out of prickly pear cider, too), and bare minimum service."}
{"text":"Love this place! My hubby and I had a last minute layover in Phoenix, and locals told us to visit Mill Avenue in Tempe. Glad we took their advice! We stumbled upon Pedal Haus. Tons of friendly, staff and visitors. Lots of local beer on tap with corn hole outside. Music was a bit loud and I couldn't even hear my hubby chatting even though he was sitting right next to me. Order the fries and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great place for a beer and dinner. Manager was great. They messed up getting our food order out and he ended up comping our dinner because it was unacceptable to him that it took over 30 minutes.  When they brought our food, it was very good. All of the staff were welcoming.  Would certainly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Best patio with afternoon shade. Beers are awesome.  
Tyler the bar manager is super friendly - one of best I've seen behind a bar. 

Update:
The renovation is awesome.  Beautiful patio and more outdoor bar area.  The service was so good.  Our bartender Sherry went beyond great!!"}
{"text":"Wow not only was the white cheddat mac n cheese amazing it was such a good portion. The beer is the best in arizona. The server was very kind and patient and the hostess... angelika (i think) was cheerful and the perfect hostess. I felt so welcomed."}
{"text":"Great food and staff. Excellent ambience inside and out. Very cool outdoor seating with baggz and ping pong. Prime location next door to an AMC theatre and Mill Ave. shops and other dining. Highly recommended for beer lovers too!"}
{"text":"Good beer and atmosphere. Food is not so great. For a starter we ordered Putin fries which was bland and this restaurant doesn't even put salt on their tables. 
For our entrees, we ordered a chile and BBQ bacon burger. I ended up getting the wrong burger with fries being a little burnt. 

The sever was also very nice. 

However I wasn't very impressed with my first experience."}
{"text":"Love this place and always will! Great bar, food is amazing, good looking bartenders to top it off"}
{"text":"DRINK REVIEW ONLY. FYI, if you check in on Facebook, you get an extra 30 minutes of happy hour. Woo! 

We went for drinks at happy hours (3-6pm weekdays) on a Friday and the place was completely packed. They have an incredible outdoor space complete with a of couple corn hole sets. A great option for hanging out with coworkers or friends after work.

I had the Farmhouse Ale and the 
Koffee Kölsch. 

The Farmhouse Ale was light and smooth. It touts an impressive ABV at 10%. For a $4 happy hour price, you can't go wrong. 

The real highlight was the Koffee Kölsch. Holy smokes. It was SO good. The smell was incredibly enticing and aromatic. Sometimes that's where the flavor profile ends, but not with this beer. The coffee flavor was near exquisite. I wish I had gotten two of these! I'll definitely be looking for it in stores, because OH MY GOD IT'S SO GOOD."}
{"text":"They recently remodeled over the summer of 2016, and it looks great! The outdoor seating is laid out in a really cool way, with half-circle \"booths\" that have fire pits in the middle. There are also some games (ping pong, cornhole, etc.). Indoor seating seems like it was reduced.

I only had drinks so I can't speak to the quality of the food. Their service was fairly good as well. Overall, it's a solid place in Tempe to eat, drink, and spend time with friends!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Bar service sucked. It is no place I would go back to. The bar was not busy and it took forever to get a new beer and then again when my wife needed a drink refill. 

Management may get a handle on the service eventually if they do not go out of business first."}
{"text":"Just went to the soft opening last night and got a personal tour with Julian (the owner) who lives by me in Tempe. I was so impressed with all the changes he made to his establishment, including some semi-private seating areas to make it easier for groups to cluster, and the most amazing redesign of the main building, including glass garage doors that slide up so the inside and outside seating can connect when the weather is nice. 

As a home brewer I continue to be impressed with the in-house beers, which Julian noted would expand to about 14 on tap and they are also doing barrel aged beers. I had the quad Belgian that was barrel aged for six months and wow, it begs to be consumed while eating an appropriately luscious desert. I have also become a fan of the ESB which seems to have been adjusted since it first cam out and now it is wonderful, though I do look forward to them having their Wit beer back on tap.

Julian notes they intend to have live music on a regular basis, which they had last night, and it was amazing! You can tell he did a huge amount of work on the redesign and it shows in a place that is both unique and inviting. I can't wait to go back again, and again, and again!"}
{"text":"Still having opening pains?? Went here on a Sunday for the firs time, wasn't very busy. It is a very large place, very open and spacious on the inside, great patio on the outside. They have a few different tables outside to play games, open kitchen (you can see into kitchen) a few different bars, lots of tables and TV's spread throughout. It reminds me a lot of The Yard. The only reason I give the 2 stars is very poor service. I am not sure if our server was the only one working on Sunday or if it was an off day. He was polite and tried taking care of us, it just took a very long time to get drinks and refills. I also had higher hopes on the food, the food is meh...... not a very large menu, so not a lot to choose from. I ordered the wings, nothing really fantastic about them, they also weren't horrible. My girlfriend ordered one of their burgers, but only ate half of it. Decent beer selection, obviously its a brewery, good drink deals on the weekends. Not sure if this place is on my list to try again though."}
{"text":"Came for some after work drinks with my coworkers, loved everything about this place. The inside is very nice and I liked all the decoration additions to it. The atmosphere is awesome, just a bunch of people getting together to enjoy their Friday. Thought it was a little weird that the hand washing sinks were outside of the bathroom but whatever, guess we all gotta be different somehow. 

I got to try a new beer (trying to expand my beer taste buds) and it was not a disappointment! And for $5, I'm not complaining. I got the sautéed mushroom burger because I have a weird obsession with mushrooms and wow it was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. I came in thinking it was going to be reminiscent of bar food but it was so much better than that. Happy hour has some pretty good specials, although only select beers are on them. Half off apps, though, so next time that'll be what I do."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since this place opened and absolutely loved it. We had a bad experience about 3 months ago because they changed their menu and the quality was horrible. We decided to give it a second chance and we will never come back. They completely changed their menu there is one German item on it. If you enjoy eating a half melted block of cheese on top of a soggy flatbread, this is the place for you. I ordered the my boy bleu burger and they brought me the fancy burger. I ordered my burger medium and when they brought the correct burger it was a hockey puck. So. Overcooked. The bun was three days old and falling apart. It's a shame because their beers are on point but their food is so beyond subpar it's ridiculous. They have such a high turnover of staff, there is not a single employee we've seen more than once here unlike our normal spots, so there is definitely something up."}
{"text":"I walked into this place unsure of what to expect. I was wandering Mill Ave in search of alcohol because work was less than fantastic and a nail decided to penetrate my tire. I got seated quickly and I was off. The menu was fantastic and the service was even better. Servers were constantly checking up on us. I give the Blue Moon-like beer a 10 and the wieners dipped in creamy cheese a 10. My only beef with this place is the avocado salad didn't specifically say it had avocado in it and that was confusing. The server reassured me only the finest California avocados we used and let me tell you, when I tasted them, it was a 100% true. Come here, get beer, get food and enjoy yourself. And, get service from over 5 different waiters. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Drinks were eh. Service was eh. They don't have any sort of allergy menu so I had to ask what I could eat on the menu. I asked about one of the burgers and the server said it was fine with no bun. I didn't realize it until halfway through my burger that there was some sort of teriyaki or soy sauce. I started getting cramps about 10 min later. Then when I told him I think there was gluten in it, he asked me if I was okay. I told him no but I just wanted him to be aware of the ingredients in their items. He still charged me for the burger and uncharged me a dollar for getting lettuce instead of a bun. Probs not coming back."}
{"text":"We loved it! Even though we're not drinkers. The food, service and atmosphere was totally awesome!!! We will definitely come back!!! Tempe is the place to be for Super Bowl Sunday. Thanks for the great experience!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere, great beer, and good food. I had a half rack of ribs, green beans, and a side caesar."}
{"text":"I love love love the atmosphere and outside seating, and the beer is great BUT many beers are often not available and the food is consistently mediocre/bad for the price. I've had a veggie burger, bread pudding, and nachos that all left a lot to be desired. The nachos were potato chips with cold, soupy beer cheese. Don't mess with a classic. It doesn't work. The bread pudding was incredibly dry, and the veggie burger was mealy.  I wish this place had better food, because I would make it a go-to."}
{"text":"While the service was mediocre at best, the atmosphere and beer were awesome. They have a great variety of beer and some unique seasonal selections."}
{"text":"One of the best pubs on Mill Avenue. The ambience is great. The waiters are friendly and service is pretty good. The music and board games are good"}
{"text":"This place is good with a limited menu. The chicken pot pie and chicken wings are great. Highly recommend them! The burgers was average but the fries that came with were good. The bread pudding was awful. The bread was hard and had a strange flavor. Wish we had gone to shake shack across the street for a dessert. The service wasn't that great but understand as a new place they are probably learning. The place is really nice inside and hard to imagine it as the popcorn place it was before."}
{"text":"I've been coming here pretty often since its opening- at least once a week but usually twice. For awhile I let some disappointing things slide bc it was new- but it's been open for several months now so I feel a honest review is warranted. I do enjoy their large patio with lots of outdoor games and the fire pit. The patio provides a cozy place to sit and watch the game while staying warm. The drink menu is good, I enjoy the wine but their beer list offers a great selection. The waiters Gina and Bryce are wonderful. The only thing about this place that really does not sit well with me is the kitchen situation. They have a space for a food truck to come serve food but I've only seen it being used once, and even then it stopped serving food around 10. As a brewery, there needs to be an option to grab something to eat. I've come here before and been starving and they offer no solution. Either the kitchen needs to stay open late offering late night snacks or the food truck set up needs to be utilized better. Finally- add pretzels to the menu- it's a brewery. Will be returning but hoping to try more of their food later at night."}
{"text":"Good food and great beer. Nice place. It was busy, it is anew place. Service could have been quicker but the waitresses were moving as quickly as they could."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Upbeat good vibes atmosphere, indoor/outdoor, lounge, bar, you name it, they got it! Food is yummy, beer is great and plenty of screens to watch the game!"}
{"text":"Ambience which is laid back and chic and rustic at the same time! A fun place to have beer!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots. I love the atmosphere and ambiance that Pedal Haus Brewery provides. The beer is great, the service is not bad, but the food is questionable. My table ordered 2 wedge salads and the lettuce was almost all brown. We also ordered a hamburger and the nachos - which were BOMB! I love that they have corn hole and ping/beer pong tables available to play. Great for a Saturday or Sunday with friends without having to worry about spending too much money."}
{"text":"Good sports bar to go hang out with some friends on mill. They have a good selection of beer on tap. They have some games and seating outside and inside. They also have a private area that you can rent out to have a small party or get together. I was actually surprised at how good the food was. Their hummus and middle eastern food is very good. The reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is that when it gets busy the service is lacking. Plus there were points that there was a line and the bar tenders were chatting instead of helping costumers. They do validate parking but only if you park to the side off them. Not if you park in the Chase parking structure."}
{"text":"Although the waitress was a little on the ditzy side, the restaurant itself was nice. The food was good, but my chicken sandwich was lacking on the amount of chicken. It was also cold in there with the breeze coming through the open double doors. I give this place a 4 star rating because I've been here before, with a better waiter and have had better food options. Today was just an off day."}
{"text":"We checked this joint out last night. Service was spot on and our food was excellent. I had the lobster roll and my wife had the fish and chips. My sandwich was a little mayo heavy but it was still really good. I give the beer a B I had a kolsch which was okay and I also tried a porter which didn't seem to have much flavor. Other than that I think we would come back."}
{"text":"Not a place I'd go back to. Why? Service and employees were just weird. I walked up from the park area, approached the hostess. There were a ton of seating options from firepit comfy seating to the uncomfortable bar area. I asked if they offer flights, and I assume the hostess assumed that I wasn't interested in eating or relaxing and she pointed me to the bar. As it turns out, considering the uncomfortable high stools and at least one of the bartenders, the bar should be the last place that the hostess should've sat me at. 

They have Four Roses Bourbon Barrel aged beer! I thought I was sold. After the first and horrible bartender asked if I wanted a food menu but never delivered, I should've left after I finished my beer. Buuut, I asked for a menu. Then, guess what? I asked if I could place my order. Don't worry though, she catered to the couple who sat across the bar from me, so not everyone gets bad service. 

I finally ordered the fried pickles. They consisted of spears and hamburger slice kosher dill pickles in a smooth batter and came with a side of ranch. Not the best fried pickles I've had, but not the worst. 

A lot of items featured on pictures on Yelp are no longer offered. For example, the mussels, don't set your heart on them. And the happy hours have changed. I'm not sure if it's a common change up, but the Wednesday that I was there, happy hour was Monday-Saturday 3-6:30. During Happy hour, it's $2 off Pedal Haus Beers, but guess what? That didn't include the barrel aged beer nor did she tell me that until later. It also includes $5 glasses of wine. I noticed the healthy pours of wine, so if that's your thing, it's a good deal. $5 margaritas, $2 off well drinks and $2 off appetizers. They also have all day Happy Hour on Sundays, but those specials are a little different."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Food was wonderful, and service was even better! Our bartender was very knowledgeable and helped us to pick out some amazing beers to try. So happy we stumbled upon this restaurant today!"}
{"text":"Before I came I heard the worst. Worst drinks and worst food. Me and my girlfriend came to give the benefit of the doubt, very disappointing. Too expensive for the mediocre food and service that was provided."}
{"text":"This place is EXPENSIVE!   Not that you don't find expensive places to eat but the food does not match the price at all.  Only reason it's getting a 2 star is 1 for the staff because they were super nice and 1 for the beer selection."}
{"text":"First of all, Kade is awesome! We had a huge group and Kade brought his A game. This is not your typical Tempe bar. The craft cocktails were really good, the atmosphere is fun and inviting (even if you are over 30). Great for groups which is hard to find!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and have some liquid refreshments. We had a great time with our family playing corn hole and enjoying the March weather. I left my billfold there by accident and didn't realize it until I got to the airport. Had to get an uber back and they had it for me safe and sound!"}
{"text":"this is absolutely THEE best brewery we found while in phoenix! visiting from colorado, my girlfriend and i are beer lovers and this place exceeded it all. the food, environment, and the beer were absolutely amazing. definitely rate this place a 16/10."}
{"text":"Ehhhhhh, at best. Cheese board is the biggest waste of 16$ I have ever had. Do yourself a favor eat somewhere else then enjoy the beers here."}
{"text":"Wonderful Happy Hour from 3-6 everyday. This means $5 glasses of any wine and $2 off any beer. The staff is super friendly and outgoing. Their pretzel, mac n cheese, and mussels are insanely delicious. Great place to grab a drink before seeing a movie next door at AMC and their outdoor patio is awesome. It has wood paneling and corn hole games. Awesome place to be, just a little expensive."}
{"text":"\"it's not that you don't like beer\", my husband tells me. \"it's that you haven't found one you like yet\".  The light lager was recommended and it was just my style.  I enjoyed my ice cold mug of golden delight very much.  We met with friends and the 6 of enjoyed an early dinner.  This is the 2nd time I've been here. The pot pie didn't disappoint.  I met \"Derek\".  I'd heard the name over the last few years and, by chance, he was still working when we arrived.  It was nice to put a face to the name \"doc\".  Everyone was friendly the place is clean and up beat."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is my second time coming here and it will now be my last. I dont know who is running that kitchen but for how basic their menu is it's sad they dont even know how to cook what they're offering. so let's go through their menu real quick.... the nachos were alright but they offer green chili chicken with it and there wasnt any chicken on them so we asked for more chicken. They bring us some green chili chicken soup that still barely had chicken in it, we complained but said its whatever. the manager offered to strain the chicken out but we turned down the offer because we figured that would take to long because we already have our food, what also upsets me with that is that they end up charging us for the extra chicken, even though its included in the dish, next the ribs...the first order they brought out was so dried out i dont understand how the kitchen thought it was ok to send that out to a table. I sent the ribs right back for a properly cooked rack of ribs and they were a little better but at that point I realized they just dont know how to cook. let's not forget about the dry cedar salad with the worst tasting croutons and their dry chicken wings. PEDAL HAUS, why is all your food so dry!?!??! WAIT WAIT IM NOT DONE...the manager, the very unprofessional manager thought it was cool to come over and just lean back on the table behind him. at first thought he was some random person that was about to start talking to us. he took care of my ribs for the check but BS us on the nachos with the extra chicken, we left the bill how it was and left and will not return but basically at the end of the day. Culinary Dropout has the same menu and better quality food and service with live music. just go there, it's around the corner. 

P.S our server Jordin did a great job even though the food was mediocre, also this was table 202 on June 2nd, 2018 that arrived around 530.......GOOD LUCK"}
{"text":"Each time I head to Tempe I spend time here at Pedal House. Each time I visit they seem to grow bigger and better.  This is a fantastic place to meet up with friends to play some cornhole in their new \"grass\" area or hang out around the fire pits in those nostalgic lawn chairs we used to have at kids. Or maybe it was just my friends and I that had those. 

The beer selection is great! You can tell the brewery team takes great care in creating a variety of great, high quality beers. It is what brings me back each and every time. You'll love it. 

Each time I go I usually just have appetizers which are good, but nothing really stands out as a must have. Go for the beer and fun!"}
{"text":"So... we arrived at Pedal Haus Brewery just a few minutes after a huge group (50-70) people who were there for a benefit bicycle ride. We were thinking we would be waiting for at least 45 min to an hour before being seated with really slow service. Fortunately we opted to eat indoors and only had to wait about 10 minutes!

Here's where things went from good to absolutely amazing, the service was just incredible and our server was very friendly and helpful with recommendations from the menu. She took our drink and food orders and within minutes our drinks were served. Our appetizer came out shortly thereafter and our main order was also brought to us just a few minutes after that.

I ordered the Block Party Burger which was good but not great after all \"Party\" is in the name so I was expecting a lot. I thought it needed more flavor added to the ground beef instead of what tasted just like ground beef with no additional seasoning. The fries were delicious which helped with the overall flavor of the dish which it needed. My wife ordered the Fungus Among Us pizza which she really enjoyed. I would say overall the food was average but the great service more than made up for it.

I probably would have only given them 3 stars, but our service was really, really great!!

We will be going back for another round within the next month or so and I'm hoping they will add a little more flavor to their Block Party Burger.

All in all it was a great lunch with outstanding service."}
{"text":"Went with some girlfriends after work one Friday! Love the ambiance of the bar, tried a couple of samples and the beer is magnificent! The thing I was most impressed with besides the outdoor patio was their Ham Sandwich. I know, it sounds simple but it was DELICIOUS and I've been thinking about it ever since! Would be fun for a group or a nice little date night! Right in the middle of mill Ave!"}
{"text":"They've been open long enough now that you would think they'd have their opening problems solved by now but NOOOO. Service was spotty at best. Got to give the place props for the size and ambition they have.  Beer was above average, food below average."}
{"text":"Came here today with my dad before catching a movie next door. We got the bbq bacon burger with fries to split and each got a beer. The food was great. My dad said the fries were the best he'd ever had! Heads up they're garlicky. They gave us a very small amount of ketchup. We asked for more and were given another cup with about a spoonful of ketchup :( Overall the service was pretty rough. There was no hostess when we arrived so we sat at a table close to the door hoping to get someone's attention. After awhile we stopped a waiter passing by and asked if we could get some menus. He seemed flustered with us. He walked up to the hostess station to get menus and as he did the hostess appeared and was chewing a mouth full of something. The waiter checked on us once and seemed annoyed to do so. I understand he wasn't expecting us there but we would have been happy to move. It was also not crowded at all. Again, the food was great but it was not a very good first experience."}
{"text":"Yep, it's all the good things everyone says! 
It's a brewery near a university campus, so keep that in mind. Loud, noisy, busy, crowded - but still lots of fun and great beer. If you like craft beer, this is one of the hot spots in the greater Valley of the Sun. 
Try it . . . I know you will like it!"}
{"text":"Not all are welcome here. If you're a University of Arizona alumni it's best to find another dining establishment. Your patronage is discouraged by the owner."}
{"text":"My 1st time to downtown Tempe was our office happy hour at Pedal Haus. I ordered the sour and it was what i would classify as an acquired taste. The server was nice and friendly but was struggling to keep up with such a large group. There were about 20 of us. Food was good and the restuarant was very hip. Great location adjacent to ASU. Looking forward to trying more of thier beers on tap. Try the pretzel sticks!"}
{"text":"I can't help but keep coming back to Pedal Haus. Located just off of Mill and next to ASU, this neat spot has a patio that can't be beat. 

I also can't say enough about the pretzels with haus mustard, and beer cheese, YUM! This time around I paired it with the Bieré Blanche although I almost got the Pilsner to complete the German effect. They really have a great menu, something for meat lovers and vegetarians alike. The wait staff and bartender were equally as impressive and friendly. 

Side note, the parking is a bit particular and your best bet is the nearby parking garage (make sure to use the Hanover parking garage for an hour of validated parking, the other parking garage lot cannot be validated here.) Otherwise all nearby parking is metered on a busy street. Better yet, if you can ride your bike (get it, Pedal Haus) even better!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with mediocre food... Not including the burgers. Second time here. When I came here the first time, I was surprised to see that it had the rating that it does. I had the bacon cheese burger and it was great. I was with two friends and they enjoyed their food as well. But... The second time we came here, we understood how it has 3.5 stars. One friend had the chicken wings and the other had the brat bites while I had the poutine. All 3 dishes were really underwhelming. The chicken wings and brat bites didn't really have any flavor. The poutine was pretty good but it took a long time to get to the table (it was slammed... ASU vs. uofa). Hopefully they figure out a better menu cause the environment is pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre at best. Our waitress checked in on us maybe three times throughout our 2 hour visit. My sandwich was bland. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is for the fries that came with it."}
{"text":"The food menu isn't bad, but if you order your drink on the rocks, the bar will charge you separately for the ice."}
{"text":"Went there in the afternoon for drinks and it was a good experience. Great atmosphere, all day Sunday happy hour, with delicious drinks and games. 

Ended up returning to Pedal Haus after the movies and was extremely disappointed. Our waitress took our orders and was never seen again. Our waters were empty for the entire night. 

The fries are the nastiest fries I've ever had in my life. They tasted like plastic and was awkwardly chewy. 

Go there for the drinks and games, but avoid the fries and entrees."}
{"text":"Limited menu, not the greatest. Pretzels were okay, the cheese an spicy sauces on the side didn't help make them more appetizing. Ordered the drunken wings, half k-bbq, half buffalo. The wings were good aside from the fact they were brought to us cold. The restaurants design and patio are really nice but I wouldn't rush back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Were going to a concert nearby and stopped here for dinner on a Friday around 6pm. We sat at the open bar area since the inside sitting had a 1/2 hour wait. I like the open bar and could see how fun it would be with cooler weather. It was pushing 90 when we were there yet the misters helped. 
They have a great in-house beer selection along with great locals.  I tried the IPA and DIPA. Both great beers and would have a got a growler if I was going home right after. The other selections range from stouts to some adventurous styles/blends such their Hefewiezen and the sour. 

The food was up scale bar food. I had the Chinese salad. It was good and I like that it was not drowned in dressing. Some others in my party had the fish and chips. They told management the fries were mush (which they were) and they comped both meals!  I thought this was great customer service since we weren't expecting this. 

The service was prompt although we had to flag down our server for the check. Considering how busy they were, this wasn't a deal breaker.

Overall, I would return to try their other beers and the great customer service is a plus as well.

Great place for out of towners since right near Mill Ave."}
{"text":"Overall a great location right in the heart of Tempe! Their cheese curds and BBQ bacon burger I ordered were cooked to perfection. I did order their Maroon and Gold brew which wasn't very impressing, let's just say a similar taste to a Coors Light... I did taste test a couple of their other brews with who I was with which were great! Will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"You MUST TRY the #Dubbel, the #Trippel if you dare, house brewed and both quite excellent!

With a wide variety of different types of house brewed beers (some of them award winning) and a TON of both domestic and imported drafts, this brew master definitely knows what he/she is up to!! If you like great service, tasty eats, modern/chic motif,  and most importantly delicious beer, then this is a mandatory stop on an ever-groundhogish-Mill Street. This microgastrobrew is a breath of fresh air, and a very welcomed one at that. 

Be forewarned, if you come when the brew master is hard at work, you'll probably want to sit outside unless the smell doesn't bother you and/or your companion. Just remember that it'll all be worthwhile once you get a taste of the sweet sweet nectar at Pedal Haus Brewery. 

NOTE: Not good for kids though, yes there is a \"play area\"  but it's obviously meant for adults people."}
{"text":"This is a great destination in downtown Tempe. The menu is limited but has amazingly tasty choices. Try the bacon wrapped dates! Also the wings are very good. Great beer selection! There is lots of bicycle parking in a parking structure for cars adjacent to the bar. It is located next to the AMC movie theater, so it's a great place to go before a film. The hostess and servers are fast and friendly. There is a large outdoor beer garden with plenty of seating and there are games like ping pong and bags."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner with a few colleagues. I was very impressed by the setup. Both inside and out look great. They have multiple bars and there's even a ping pong table outside. The service was great as the staff was friendly and efficient. We ordered a few appetizers: pita with hummus, wings, pretzels, corn fritters, poutine fries and they were all delicious and freshly made. My favorite starter goes to the corn fritters. For my main course, I ordered chicken fingers with French fries. The pieces  of chicken were huge and tasty. The dipping sauces provided were ranch, buffalo and ketchup. I tried some of my fiancées fish and chips, too. Huge, fresh and delicious. Everyone in my party loved their main dish. I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Came to the preview event. Great food! Can't wait for the brew to start flowing. Fantastic service from Chris."}
{"text":"This bar/restaurant it located just off Mill Ave so it's atmosphere is a little more cozy. There is plenty of seating, as well as a variety of seating: high tables, booths, beer garden community style, camp fire, regular seating, whatever. They have corn hole and maybe other games? I never personally played but just saw they had some games from a distance. 

Their happy hour deals are pretty good, $2 off appetizers, cocktails and their house beers I believe. My favorite entree to order is the Miso Salmon Salad. I don't eat a lot of seafood because I am picky but this is really good! It's only $11 too. The service is great, they are attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try this restaurant and was really pleased.  I'll admit it, I was lured in by their logo- the hare and bicycles!
The beer list is good- Dragoon IPA was a great selection.  I ordered the Mussels but for $4 more subbed in asparagus for the fries.  Growing up along the East Coast, I'm always a bit hesitant to order shellfish in AZ but these were FANTASTIC.  Large out of the shell, perfectly steamed in a great sauce for dipping the bread.
Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great pedal-up location in downtown Tempe!  Good, fresh beer on tap...but the food just seemed ok.  Great atmosphere and fresh beer will likely bring me in again...would be nice to see a few more taps and variety."}
{"text":"Pedal Haus is top notch. Food is great, atmosphere amazing and staff very friendly and competent! The manager Joe took care of us personally for a minor issue.
Will come back again and again! I recommend Pedal Haus if you want to have a great time!"}
{"text":"My 2nd visit. It's March Madness, the busiest I've ever seen in here and it's probably only at 35% capacity. I've been here for a little over an hour and have had the server only come by maybe twice - to grab waters and take our order. No sense of urgency. Inadequately staffed. Mediocre food. Prices are average. This place might close down like the rest of the attempts at this location. The consecutive visits and lack of any speedy urgency by the staff gets this 1 star. The only only plus? Is the decor. Too bad the service doesn't match."}
{"text":"Oh man... just... horrible, all around. Food was very bland, beer tasted flat like they don't go through it fast enough. Would highly recommend avoiding this heap."}
{"text":"This place has alienated all university of arizona fans. They made the U of A Athletic department move an event they were hosting for u of a fans and alumni around tempe because of their \"personal and professional views\" . I guess money and patronage means nothing if you have any affiliation to the university of arizona. Will never go back here again, wont be missing much anyways as the food is overpriced and subpar!"}
{"text":"Place is decent. Came here on a Saturday night and surprisingly wasn't as full as I expected. Beer is great and cheap during happy hour. Food was ok. I advise to stay away from the mushroom and asparagus pasta. I think the food here could use a little something extra. Pot pie tasted like it came a can, classic burger was good, shrimp scampi was great just a little under seasoned. Won't come back for the food but definitely for the beer and happy hour."}
{"text":"Overall, had a good experience here! I loved the open air outside tables. We waited about 40 min but we could have a drink at the bar near the entrance while we were waiting. Once we got seated the service was great. The prices were good for the amount and quality of food. My husband got the half rack of ribs and got to pick Brussels sprouts and a salad for sides. (The Brussels sprouts are AMAZING!!) 

I ordered the veggie pizza. I was brought one with meat on it though.... that was a bummer but they did fix it right away. The manager also came to check in on us which was nice.

Great selection of local beers, both brewed there and in and around Arizona!"}
{"text":"PH has used this space wonderfully - very modern and great energy. After having a drink at the bar while we were waiting for our large table, we ordered the chicken pot pie and mussels with fries. Very tasty but they should have put the fries on the side instead of making it soggy with it being in the same pot. We also shared the bacon wrapped dates and they were super yummy and flavorful, cooked to perfection served with a spring of herbs.

Cannot wait to come back and try other dishes! It's fun for a group event or to watch sports!"}
{"text":"They need to figure their shit out!!! This is not an upscale place so why are they charging $8 for bourbon & another $4 for an old fashion, when I did not ask for a specific kind of alcohol? (This isn't the gladly)Nachos we bellow par there was very lil cheese and toppings on them we had to ask for additional toppings to turn our chips into nachos but chicken finger were decent. Their signature \"moonshine Paloma \" was just tequila with lil Paloma. So basically we paid $60 for 3 drinks chicken fingers and nachos! On the upside our waitress Mackenzie was very sweet and accommodating! 

Work your shit out before your grand opening!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch around 12:30pm on a weekday with some of the people in my department. It wasn't packed at all. Albeit, the place is huge, but there were probably only five or tables that were filled. 

I ordered the Green Chili Burger [$13], and we shared the Pub Deviled Eggs [$6]. The burger was pretty good; the meat was juicy and the bread was nice and big. I asked for the haus slaw. For the price, it's probably smaller than what it was worth. The location is nice, and I love the decor (the whole bicycle theme going on). The deviled eggs were deviled eggs, nothing different from what you probably had at a friend's house. 

The service was spectacularly slow. The food was good, nothing too special, but had everything else been going right, then I wouldn't mind going to Pedal Haus to meet with friends and have grub here. However, the waitress who was assigned to our table was so busy with the other restaurant goers that we remained forgotten for the most part. The place wasn't that busy either, so I'm not sure what was going on. 

In conclusion, if a friend suggests this place, okay, I'll go, but I don't see myself actively seeking this place out to have lunch."}
{"text":"This is a huge bar. They have about 4 individual bars between restaurant and patio so you shouldn't have trouble getting a drink! I ordered my beer in a stein mug - hey when in Rome! It was heavy, but I liked attempting to chug my beer like I was at the true Oktoberfest. They had pretty good food, but while tasty it was also DRIPPING with grease. It's hard to enjoy when you want to run to the restroom and wash your hands after each bite. There was also a food truck on the patio, that's pretty cool and it's nice they have different options - order from a server or a food truck, pick whichever bar you're closest to, I could see some major drinking holidays successfully taking place here - (think St. Patty's Day, Oktoberfest New Year's Eve and ASU games)! Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is a really amazing place. Really cool ambience, the food was great and the people are interesting but the service is terrible. Unless you plan on being there for three hours or more, prepare yourself. Still worth a try if you just need a place to hang out and have some good beer."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it has such an excellent location and their menu looks awesome.  My concern is that their water tastes terrible and it affects anything that comes out of their tap. I'm concerned that if it tastes bad what are they using to brew there Beer with? Also I found their drinks and food to be a bit overpriced and overcooked to the point of greasy. There are too many great places to enjoy downtown Tempe that I won't be trying this place again"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in,
we were greeted and immediately seated.
They were prompt on helping us with the drink choices and the orders came out quick.
Many beer choices to try and I tried couple them and they all tasted good.
Great customer service as they tried to even keep my water glass full all the time and I don't need to say about my beer glass now."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a bite while we were there for the art festival - what a find!!  The menu is great, we decided to split an order of their appetizer mussels & fries with a couple of their great beers.  When the waitress delivered the covered pot we took the lid off and found they forgot the fries so we mentioned it to the bartender.  Within a few minutes he brought us a order of fries what great service.  

The dish was so great we came back and had another order for dinner.  We sat at the bar and Todd the bartender was still there he comment \"oh your back\".  The second order was just as good and when we mentioned it was a shame that they didn't serve bread to enjoy with the broth he went off and brought us an order.  

Well were going back tonight on our way to see Carrie Underwood - I know we will get the mussels & fries and hopefully the chicken pot pie."}
{"text":"Amazing! Food was on point. Atmosphere is truly one of a kind. Never been anywhere like it, and that's a good thing. Owner knows what he's doing!"}
{"text":"Incredible tasty BEER! Hats off to the brewers! Food right there with the beer! Food very good! If you like pickles the fried pickles are a must! Deviled egg dip is devilishly flavorful! Pastrami sandwich, chicken pot pie, chicken tenders to the ribs AWESOME! Customer service is a 10! Great job to all the employees!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I stopped by to grab a bite for lunch and completely forgot the PF Changs Rock n Roll marathon was finishing up. This place was completely packed but had an amazing vibe. We got a few seats at the bar and ordered a nice cold Pilsner! Wow o wow! Loved that beer so much I had to order another one. We both ordered the green chili burger and it is by far my favorite burger on Mill Ave! I would definitely come back with the hubby and chill outside on their beautiful patio!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, great place to hit on a bike ride around Tempe or for brunch. The beer they brew is pretty bomb and the food is great. Definitely get the bread pudding. Poutine is meh."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and great Moscow mule! Went on a Monday night so it wasn't very busy, but staff is very friendly. Dogs are more than welcome as well. They even brought my dog some water!!"}
{"text":"My most favorite bar on mill avenue. They have a great range of beers. The food is delicious, specially dolmades. Great place to relax with friends and family with games and good music. Their coffee brew and cocktails are a must try. Loved the open seating they offer!"}
{"text":"Can one judge a brewery in one beer? Probably not, but the one beer I had at Pedal haus was really good.... I had the nitro maple milk stout and it was very tasty..  A nice hint of sweetness in the beer. The atmosphere was also nice, especially their patio which features a long fire pit. I would like to go back to try their food and more beers. My only complaint? They only sell beer by the pint whereas most breweries give you a few size options to allow you to taste more beers (this is a minimal complaint). I will be back!"}
{"text":"Never in my life have I been treated the way the bartender/ shift manager treated me and my group of friends. You would think at 8 pm on Sunday night when an establishment is DEAD with ZERO CROWD they would want our business but the bartender was a straight judgemental ass hole. Never again will I ever visit this bullshit restaurant and I highly recommend nobody else does the same unless they want rude service and constant judgement for literally doing nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Sunday night dinner. Guac and chips were outstanding. Guac if made from fresh avocados. The miso salmon was tasty, especially the dressing made from scratch. Lots of salmon pieces. Brisket ragu pasta was better than my mom used to make. The pasta is homemade fresh. Brisket was juicy and tender. The sauce very tasty like a beef stew yet was so light. I highly recommend for a great meal accompanied by their outstanding beer selection they make in house."}
{"text":"One of our new favorite places for sure!! Amazing layout, casual, fun and great for groups of people and social gatherings! My husband and I went there and I almost wanted to call other people to join because it has such a fun environment! It's really
Neat to sit among the barrels and brew areas and the outside seating is really fun with ping pong tables. 
The prices are really reasonable too, especially for the drinks. It was kind of surprising, a lot of restaurants with similar style and menu are charging a lot more! Definitely a bonus! 
\"The World's Best Chicken Tenders.\" My husband first commented, \"well that's kind of cocky to say that.\" Then we tried them. They truly live up to their name! Crunchy and perfectly seasoned, I will
 Go back for the chicken tenders alone! 
Or server was quick and really friendly. He was really knowledgeable about the menu which I appreciate. He also said that they are still working on their menu and will be offering pizza soon. They have a pizza oven and everything! As if this place couldn't get any better!!"}
{"text":"Walking into this place I was quite impressed with the decor and amount space. Today was super hot but would maybe come back and enjoy the patio. The selection of beer was pretty good and tasted good too. However this is where the review goes downhill. Service was terrible not only did our waitress only check in a few times over 2 hour period. It took almost an hour to get our food with no apologies from anyone when the food was brought out. It took about another 10 minutes from our waitress to come ask how the food was. Which we ended up complaining as one of burgers ordered which was chicken was completely cold. Super gross. The only saving grace for this place was they got us a new burger and took it off the bill. However it still does not make up for the hour wait with no apologies."}
{"text":"This is a great place to lounge, hangout, and play some games. The bar food and beer is good. The entrees we had were not the best (lobster pasta) it was not creamy and all lobster knuckle, could be better for a $20 dish."}
{"text":"I was pretty hesitant to go here originally. But, my friends coerced me out and I'm so glad they did. Their house brewed beers were fantastic - we tried the amber, porter, and kölsch. The porter was one of the best beers I've ever had, almost too drinkable. 

The cheese curds were fantastic (not surprising) and our entrees (I had the open-face hot ham and cheese) were phenomenal. The menu was a bit smaller but I think it was done well. Food came promptly and the service was perfectly adequate. The patio is very inviting with enough size to keep anyone happy. Really glad I came here, and will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with friends.  I got the half beer can chicken with broccoli and mashed potatoes.  The chicken was delicious!  Very tender.  The broccoli was cooked just right.  But the mashed potatoes were so salty I couldn't eat them.  My husband got the same dish and he felt the same way.

The server could have been better.  Only saw her when she was taking our order or bringing our food or drinks.  Didn't check up on us or replenish the water.

The atmosphere is lively.  It's very close to the ASU campus so there is a lot of college kids here.  A lot of TVs with sports playing.

One thing I liked is that the sinks are outside the bathrooms.  You don't have to worry about touching that door handle after you wash your hands!"}
{"text":"The location and patio area were great and the servers were very efficient.  The beer was decent. The negative was the they advertise free validated parking at the structure;  when I presented my parking ticket to the server he said it did not apply to the structure connected to the rear., the actual structure was a further walk somewhere down the street and I ended paying $12.00 for 1 hour of parking. I ordered a blue cheese burger medium and ended up with well done.  The cheese didn't taste right and made me sick the rest of the night."}
{"text":"This place is HUGE and pretty freaking gorgeous if you ask me. This is one of those college hangout spots, but the indoor/outdoor seating and misters really makes this place a cool spot to kick it. The beer menu is quite substantial and yields some pretty awesome home-brews in a fantastic assortment. The staff here is uber friendly and really engages the customer. Overall, Pedal Haus does the brewery game quite well and really takes care of their establishment nicely. 

Legit-
Great location 
Indoor/outdoor seating 
Misters everywhere
Great beer menu 
Food is good
Friendly staff 
Huge and functional layout 
TV viewing angles

Meh-
Nothing really..."}
{"text":"Came here w/ a group of 15 guys after a day on the links and had a great time. We sat outside on the long tables w/benches which were perfect to accommodate our large group. Servers ensured our varied beverage orders were promptly met, and the beer options were excellent.  Several guys hit the Baggo courts, and I liked the comfortable viewing chairs that lined the \"field of play\". All around fun place.

Cheers!

{"text":"Love the feel and vibe of this place the remodel is nice. The games and outdoor spaces are nice addition. We waited for a table however when many tables were open in an area that was very warm not waiting friendly. Once seated we had to wait a long time for orders and we are pretty sure they forgot one item that they said was getting extra attention. The food however was great we loved appetizers and we had chicken pot pie it was a great flavor. Beer was also very good. Had to send ice tea back it was actually thick....why??? If it weren't for limitations in customer service would have given them a 4 star review. Staff are quite nice just scarce."}
{"text":"I came in here after looking for brew pubs on Yelp and this place did not disappoint. I ordered two flights of beer. The bartender, Chris, was great at walking me through everything and I was thoroughly impressed with the selection. I had the Devil Fries & Chicken Pot which both were awesome!!"}
{"text":"Have always come here a lot. This is the first time since the remodel. I like the environment and the menu a lot, much less pretentious. However I have always noticed that this place makes apps differently during happy hour (-$2). Cheese plate with half as much cheese, etc. Tonight the cheese curds, usually out of this world, lacked fluff and crispiness. Some of them didn't even have cheese in them or were deflated and a bit soggy. Also got the \"pretty decent\" nachos. Yeah, they're pretty decent. Mediocre. Paid an extra three dollars for \"guacamole\" which was actually just avocado chunks on the top. Should probably have more chicken and toppings on them for the price. But yeah, pretty decent is a good way to describe them. I love pedal house but wasn't super thrilled about them tonight."}
{"text":"Very cool / hip looking place indoors and out. Our server was very friendly. The catered food they walked by us with to a large corporate party on the outside looked impressive.

My hubby's opened faced ham sandwich was tasty but my kale and romaine salad with a $6 shrimp add on (in addition to the $9 base price) was not worth it. Neither were the (2) brisket egg rolls for $10. Also, they were completely out of the first 3 beers we chose off of the printed beer menu.

We will be back, but only during happy hour or during their $12 (?) breakfast buffet."}
{"text":"So this is a difficult way to begin a meal at a brewery: 

Me: Is x beer on the sweeter side?

Waitress: I don't know anything about beer. I know, I work at a brewery. 

Me: How long have you worked here? 

Waitress: since it opened, but we've only been open a month since the remodel.

Okay...    Given the table menus give little more insight then the brand and name of beer (excluding the type of beer) don't come here unless you know what you want.

Tried the Pedal Haus in house brew: The Bourbon Barrel Aged Quad sounds great but tastes like rubbing alcohol with a hint of Carmel. 

Then went for the safer Guest beer.....New Belgian Pumpkick.  Was great but you can get it anywhere.  Food was okay.  The salmon salad is cold salmon.  Egh. 

All in all ask questions about the menu, but don't assume staff is trained well enough to answer you."}
{"text":"I'm so done with this place. First time we came here (around opening day) food was awesome. Second time food/service were awful. Went again recently and:
$15 for fried chicken entree which was 1/2 of one chicken cutlet, with an ear or corn, and dried out brussel sprouts sprinkled with dry bacon. The brussel sprouts really made no sense, no flavor or even olive oil to make them palatable, but the fact that a $15 entree couldn't even come with a full breast of chicken? Most places gives you at least 1/2 a chicken when you order fried chicken. Total rip off and just so cheap and skimpy on behalf of the restaurant.
Ordered the mac n cheese, which was amazing on our first visit. What we got this time was a watered down soupy mess that tasted like beer and nothing else. So disgusting and unappetizing- we asked our server to take it off the bill- which when asked they acted like they already knew it was bad. A quick \"I'm so sorry I'll take it off the bill right away\" before I could even explain what was wrong with it. 
The second time we came here I figured it was just them working out the new restaurant kinks. Now they've been open for long enough to know what they're doing, and they're doing a terrible job. Such a bummer."}
{"text":"The renovations (not that it really needed any) make this place a very solid five-star option in an area of Tempe where most bars cater to a slightly more boisterous crowd. 

Look for sponsored bar/picnic/tailgate game competitions, live (legit) bands, and really solid food and bar bites. The beer selection is diverse and they list the beers about to come out at the bottom of menus to make sure you come back.

The TV set-up for games is exceptional. And I was blown away that during the last UFC event, it was just \"on\" one of the TVs, no crazy charge at the door, even though there was also a really solid live band playing on the stage. They even have a semi-closed off banquet room if you need to host a dozen friends.

Not to be overlooked, the service here is top notice. Points to some of the bartenders (Rene, A++) which make you (a) really feel at home, (b) offer great recommendations and (c) make you want to just hang out for 4-6 hours rather than crawl to the next establishment (as so many in the area do).

Every time I am in the area, I come by PHB. No question. It never disappoints."}
{"text":"They have great beer! If the only reason to go is the beer, do it. Food is pretty good to but not very cheap so keep that in mind. It is a good place for happy hour with your friends and their patio is pretty big so it be a great place to go when it's not too hot out!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat here and it was very disappointing. They first lost our reservation and the ten minute wait turned into 40 min. The manager tried to fix the situation and we hoped it would get better. The pretzel bread is out of this world but everything else was worth skipping and not worth the experience. The nachos were mostly sour cream and the cheese had an odd bitter flavor. We had 2lbs of nachos on our table untouched. None of us would eat them. I ordered a coffee and the waitress said it would take a while to brew coffee and gave the impression that it was inconvenient to her night. When the coffee arrived it was cold and old.  I also ordered a side Caesar and when the bill came, I noticed they charged me a $1 for croutons. I didn't order croutons and only 3 croutons were on my plate. We thought it was hysterical to pay .33 a crouton!!  We saw our waitress twice and literally gave her our credit card as she did a fly by. We couldn't wait to leave. With all of the choices in Arizona, we should've chosen better. 

On the plus side, the bartenders are kind, funny and make great drinks. Stay at the bar and skip the food / service of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to re-opening. Obviously put more into concept but this yard wannabe is only that. 1st waitress was great & nachos only ok & beers a little better. 2nd barmaid was awful & food only ok & pricey for what rec'd. Concept needs a lot of work...ps went back & much better!"}
{"text":"Great lobster roll and lobster mac and cheese!! For a Monday night, this place was filled to the brim! Live music, great vibes and good company make this place a great destination if you are a tourist in town."}
{"text":"With the recent remodel, there are great new enclaves and little nooks to settle into. Very wonderful use of space. Tasty, refreshing, and well balanced brews with EXCELLENT food.

The menu is seasonal, which rocks, so you will always find something to love.

I just had a lobster roll that changed my life.

Happy Hour on Sundays provides $3 in house beers & mimosas, and $4 Bloody Marys and Margaritas.

They also have games on the patio, and shuffle board inside if you aren't into the elements."}
{"text":"So we stopped in to have a few beers on a Sunday afternoon, and I gotta say I was impressed. The beer was delicious. They look very clean and everything is new. This would have gotten 5 stars as a fist timer here, but the bartender kept 1 of those.... I'm new to these breweries and i'm used to my Coors Light. So when I walk into a place like this it sucked that the bartender was acting like a snob. My friend and I asked a couple question and I swear he acted like he was disgusted that we didn't know everything about the beers.  Maybe he had a crazy Saturday night and partied with Snoop Dogg and Dre, and spent his early morning flying back from the huge party that they had on their Yacht in Miami, where Alf and the a Kardashian made a guest appearance, or maybe he just got hammered in his Apt with his old frat friends... Either way he looked miserable and was being snobby, we would have probably stayed there for another couple rounds instead of walking across the street to another bar if it wasn't for him. We'd def. be willing to try it again though. I wont let a beer snob between me and my sweet, delicious beer."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've been here now a few times and they've worked out all the kinks. Great food. Great beer choices. Great service. Great atmosphere. It's located right in the heart of Mill Avenue, but just off the street. It's dog-friendly and the patio space heaters are a great touch. Come and play a few yard games and hang out with your pals. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I must say I'm impressed. Service is great and the chicken pot pie is to die for. Cool atmosphere and I like the different kinds of beers!  Fun to hang out and play games and there always seems to be a TV in view."}
{"text":"First time at pedal haus. Disappointing. Nearly five minutes before hostess greeted us. 15 minutes wait turned to 35 to be seated . Another 10 minutes for wait staff to take our order. Great American Larger not to be confused with weak hummus appetizer. Baked chicken excellent however served with mashed potatoes for three. My sons chicken sandwich average, my wife's salad just OK. Had to ask for check and again long wait to run my card. Obviously under staffed. Be careful about parking too; they do not validate pricy public parking. Seems like great spot for beer, socializing, and watching a game. One time and done."}
{"text":"Came here with work and the food was good, but nothing that jumped out to me, what I didn't get was any beers due to the company I was with.  It is hard to judge a place properly when their food would be best paired with some beers.  If I find myself back in this area, I would like to try the combination."}
{"text":"This place is great! They've been open for less than a week, so don't yet have their own beer but it's coming. We came in for happy hour and sat at the bar. The environment was nice and casual and the bar tender was very friendly and knowledgable.

We grabbed two appetizers, the Tempura Grilled Bratwurst and the Prime Brisket Egg Roll. The egg roll was phenomenal.

Their beer selection was also solid, multiple local breweries to Arizona which always a plus in any state I visit.

I highly recommend this place and will be coming back again for sure!"}
