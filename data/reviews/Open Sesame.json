{"text":"How much or how little is up to you, and it takes a little getting used to. Judging proportions and taste combinations must be an art.  Difficult to sum up the experience but it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Fresh is good. Selection is good. But, standing in line behind a bunch of people who are taking their time to consider all of the possible combinations of vegetables to be cooked for them was incredibly annoying. Might go back for a regular sit-down lunch but do not like this routine at all."}
{"text":"The prices are very reasonable for what you get and it's our favourite restaurant. It's delicious and definitely worth getting dessert. I have not been disappointed once. The only downside is the parking can be a nightmare if you are going for dinner, and wait times may not be good. They do take out though which we've done a few times.. it's delicious !"}
{"text":"I went to Open Sesame on McLeod Train on a couples date with my lady. I had no expectations really, as it seemed to be rather tacky on the outside, but overall I had a positive experience.  The place is dimly lit and has a modern Asian feel to it. I went for a tour of the fresh Asian Market, which is where you can create your own \"Asian Creation\". You get to choose your own meat, veggies, and sauces and then the whole thing is prepared by a chef and delivered to your table when it's ready. Not bad for under $15! It's hot and hopefully - if you've done your saucing right - delicious!  We all shared what I would refer to as \"Asian Tapas\" - basically little appetizers meant for two people. The spring rolls where nice and crispy and not to greasy, and the salt & pepper calamari was quite flavourful. They all went nicely with my Tiger Beer, which brought back memories of Thailand.  All in all, a pleasant experience.  But make sure to make a reservation on Saturday nights, because the people waiting in the lobby weren't having as good of an experience!"}
{"text":"I have never been a profound fan for \"Make-Your-Own-Dinner\" type of restaurants as it takes away the essence and adventure of trying the new flavours and styles of food.  The whole concept I find is a total money waster; at places like the Mongolian Grill or Xan, you pick out as much food as you want to only discover that your wallet may be a tad lighter than expected since they weight your dish to set a price.  Because my dad has a great appreciation for food as I do, he really wanted to go to Open Sesame after my sister raved about how great the place was.  So we made a 25 minute journey from the northwest of Calgary to the south to check it out.  My bias towards customizing your own dinner did change when I saw the menu.  Set at a very reasonable $10.50, you can add in as much ingredients as you want.  I also liked how they had other food choices ranging from combo dishes, appetizers to rice and noodle bowls, etc, etc.   My dad and I decided to be cheap Asians that night and went the go stir crazy route.  Our server gave us big metal bowls and asked what our preference was in different types of rice or noodles.  From there we were ushered to a place that reminded me of a very busy IKEA cafeteria for some reason.  With two stations, one for food, and other for sauce, both were so busy that we had to wait 10 minutes for it to clear up.  However in that time I decided to people-watch and was rather amused and semi-disgusted at how gluttonous humans can be as some literally had a tower of food stacked in their bowl, while others had drowned theirs in 10 different types of sauces.  But I guess if you're paying $10.50, my as well right? Being a vegetarian can be limiting when eating out - however at Open Sesame there is a large assortment of vegetables to choose from,  I just thought it was kind of weird how raw meat is placed right beside the veggies though.  Once I was at the sauce station, I can understand why people wanted to try every sauce where there was every kind imaginable.  I decided to play it safe and go with the teriyaki sauce...for first time goers, don't mix every sauce together - it's going to taste like crap.  So the dinner altogether was average - I could have made what I ate at home, but the experience (and people watching) was what made the dinner.  I definitely would like to go again and try other things from the menu though.  This place is a great choice to go to as it is suitable for everybody of all types of food preferences.  I won't be running back here anytime soon, but will definitely check it out if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"First off, let me say I am perhaps biased to do-it-yourself stir-fry restaurants since I am a huge fan of stir-fries in general. However, I love Open Sesame, I think it has a great atmosphere & delicious food.   Comparisons to Mongolie Grill have often been made; I will say that the do-it-yourself stir-fry is where the similarities end. Open Sesame has a full menu, the stir-fry is just one of the options. The ambience is about 100 times better since MG looks a little cafeteria-ish and is nothing fancy at all. MG can get pretty pricey, whereas OS has a flat rate of around $10 + meat choice $, no matter how much of it you pack in your bowl. It just seems more sanitary to me as well, since they only lay the vegetables out, not the raw meat alongside - the cooks add that as they cook it.   Other than stir-fry, I had delicious pot-stickers and shared a funnel cake that was sinfully delicious. The rest of the menu looks fantastic & I can't wait to try other features! I will definitely be back for more - it's one of my current Calgary favourites!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and it was delicious. We chose the stir fry feature and ordered the chow mein noodles and shrimp for our protein option. The waitress gave us a bowl to add veggies and sauce. Once you're done, place the bowls on the kitchen table and they make your stir fry as you wait at your table. The atmosphere is great for a date!"}
{"text":"You know what? I kind of love Open Sesame. For full on white-person Asian Fusion, it's pretty great. I highly recommend starting with the veggie spring rolls (they have the BEST plum sauce everrr) (but they are pretty expensive for just 2 spring rolls... i think they end up being like $3.50 per spring roll, which is not okay, but they're tasty), or the tereyaki riblings (I want a bottle of this sauce so I can pour it on all the things).   I'm a wild one, so I like to go stir-crazy and make my own stir fry. I think this is why I really like this place, but a lot of folks aren't crazy about it. You gotta know what goes well together. It's taken me a few years, but I think I've reached stir-fry mastery. Do not go to the stir-fry bar and just put whatever in your bowl and think that it's going to be amazing. Think about it. Be one with the stir fry bar. Do curry sauce and peanut sauce really go well together? Do you really want banana chips with your black bean sauce? It takes a bit of consideration and trial and error, but you'll be able to eventually find the best combo for you!   Also, they have a great drink menu! They have a lot of really tasty non-alcoholic options for teetotalers like myself. The pomegranate green iced tea is super yummy and not too sweet, and they have a lot of great smoothie things like the Aladdin's Passion and the Sabai (which is great to drink if you're eating something spicy.   I do have a couple of things to consider, however! One time I went here and the waitress spilled a full 2 drinks on me and didn't comp anything for me. Which was kind of a bummer. I only bring that up because it sucked. So, service could be better, and they don't have a great handle on their wait times (whenever I come, they tell me \"Oh only 10 minutes\" or \"20 minutes\" and then I end up sitting there for an hour or whatever, which kind of sucks). But I still come back! The food is really good and it's worth the wait and the not awesome service."}
{"text":"The food is alright in fact i would consider going again. Our server though was really friendly. she actually took time to talk to us and made sure my wife and i were happy even though she had a lot of other tables, had some laughs with her  and a good evening. I wouldn't have guessed she was new since she seemed to know what she was talking about. Food comes out a little burnt though from the wok, not sure what thats about. anyways id give the server a 5/5 (and a 10 ;) ), maybe food 3.75"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!!! I have always had good experiences with service and food. I would recommend the thai bouillabaisse, hibachi steak, or the create your own stir fry, they always turns out great!!! The servers are friendly and polite and the kitchen always gets my order right. Great place to try with a large group, as they can accommodate parties of up to 25 in your own private room, perfect for an upcoming Christmas party!!!!      I would recommend a reservation (403-259-0123), especially on the weekend because without one the wait can be almost an hour, though phone at least a day in advance for reservations as they don't book out the entire restaurant with reservations to accommodate walk ins.   A must try!! Calgary classic!"}
{"text":"we thought this place was great when we arrived, but the things we ate just seemed to be 'ready-made' items. i recommend trying it and seeing for yourself. the place is beautiful and the choices are good. it just lacked authenticity for me."}
{"text":"Good:  1. Fried crab & cream cheese wonton. It's from heaven.  2. Banana wonton & ice cream. Very nicely done.  3. They give you chopsticks!  Bad:  1. It's \"asian-fusion\". There isn't one asian working or eating there. Bad news number one.  2. Half of the ingredients out at the bar is not  real stir fry ingredients. How often do you see tomatoes in stir fry?  3. Too much ready-to-go sauces. You can only taste the sauce, nothing else. Of course it's going to taste \"good\"! Let's take out all those sauces and replace with only soy sauce. See how good they can make it.  4. Just because it's stir fry doesn't make it good asian food. Throwing cheese on a dish doesn't make it Italian.   \"Fusion\" = half assed. However, I do plan on going back to try other things on the menu, but not so much stir fry."}
{"text":"This place wins me over with it's decor and ambience. Eclectic, intimate, creative--really ideal for a date night or girls night out. The atmosphere would get five stars, hands down.  The noodle bowls we had for lunch were tasty, though nothing extraordinary.  Dragon bowl- quite tasty Sesame bowl- tasty, but way too much sauce Malaysian bowl- one of the tastiest, but spicy! Kung Pao chicken rice bowl- ok  You also have the option of a \"choose your toppings\" stir-fry bar (Mongolian grill-esque)"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance place. Food was really good and serving was fast. I would definitely go back to this place again..."}
{"text":"I love Open Sesame! I always make sure to go when I'm back in town. The market place thing where you get to pile your bowl with as much vegetables and sauce as you can is great for me, because I'm kind of picky when it comes to peas and mushrooms!   Also, the banana wontons are amazing! Weekends can get busy, so a reservation is a good idea, and parking isn't so great, but I've always found a spot, even if it was tiny."}
{"text":"Had a great time here for my hubs bday. They had plenty of dishes marked as gluten free which was nice they made it so easy. Not a huge fan of the tandoori chicken appie but the stirfry was awesome. Even the other 3 who did not require GF were extremely satisfied. Plus the server was great too! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I used to absolutely love this place and would go maybe a couple times a month, until my last visit there. I went with my two kids and ordered an appetizer and a stir fry that I would force my kids to at least take a bite of since they are such picky eaters. The appetizer came which my kids ate and then they dropped off the stir fry. The manager then came to my table and told me that there was 5.95 sharing fee per kid but since my waiter never told me, I would only be charged for one.   Since I in no way overfilled my bowl of vegetable (not all you can, they give portioned bowls) there were numerous other people in the restaurant with bowls piled high and I had to pay an extra $12 ( almost the cost of another stir fry) to force my kids to eat a piece of broccoli off my plate. They didn't even bring out fresh plates to share with my kids they just left the leftover plates from the appetizer.  This just seems greedy it took no extra food from the restaurant or extra work from any of the staff."}
{"text":"Open Sesame is hands down one fo my favorite restaurants.  I have been here both on romantic dinners with my Husband and fun casual dinners with friends.  If you plan on going here on the weekend, I highly recommend a reservation, a couple days in advance at least.  Otherwise expect a 40 minute to an hour wait.  Parking can be sparse on busy nights.  The ambiance and decor of this place are mysterious and exotic.  It is quite dim, with a beautiful pillar fireplace in the centre of the main area.  A cool place to sit is what I like to call \"the blue room\"  it over looks the main restaurant.  They have a pretty extensive drink menu, with bottled beers from around the world.  Sometimes they are out of stock when it comes to the more popular beers, in which case you can just ask what they do have in stock.  The berry daiquiri is very yummy.   The menu consists of a variety of asian inspired dishes, all reasonably priced.  The teriyaki-wasabi ribs are a must try, very saucy and meaty!  I always go with the fresh market.  Starting at $7.95 you choose a rice or a noodle (there are about 6 options), then pick out your veggies and sauce.  You can add on meat, like beef, chicken, shrimp, etc.  for approx $3 each.  You tell your choices to the server and they return with a empty bowl and a slip of paper with your choices on it.  Then you get to go to the veggie station, which has a good variety, including bamboo shoots, a must try.  Now is the fun part!  I always have a good laugh with my friends on who can make the biggest heap of veggies in their bowl, I've got it down to an art!  Then you top it off with your sauce, they have about 12 options or so and take it to the cooks with your slip of paper.  Sometimes there can be a bit of back-up in the kitchen, but I've never waited too long.  At the end, the bill with a drink or too, usually for 2 persons, isn't over $40.  All I can say is that Open Sesame is a fun, creative and affordable dining experience.  Whenever I have visitors, this is the place we go.  If you like Asian inspired food, you can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"I'm writing my review based on the \"Asian Market\" create your own bowl menu item. I now know that I am not a fan of paying restaurant price plus tip to \"create my own\" dish because it's too expensive when you know you may screw up your choices (which I felt I did make incorrect decisions). I like paying $14+ for a dish in a restaurant because the chef knows which foods go with certain flavors best.  I would not choose this menu item/food experience again anywhere except at home and maybe Subway. Having said that, I will give this place another try in the future and select menu items other than the create your own bowl thing. The atmosphere is very unique and textural, so one star for that and the service was good. The after dinner cappuccino fell flat and mostly tasted like paint thinner. We also ordered some chocolate filled spring rolls which sounded exciting but the portion and size of spring roll was disappointing."}
{"text":"Open Sesame,  For sure one of my favourite restaurants in Calgary now for many, many years! I love the Interior design, decorating and lighting, Very cool! Gives you an \"Asiany feel and very original.  Anyways the important part: FOOD! yes great food :) I have mastered my \"build your own\" stir fry dish. I actually haven't ordered any other main dish because the garden market is soo good :) I love the variety of veggies: tofu, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, shitake mushrooms, banana chips, mandarin oranges.. and many more! And not to mention fresh garlic, ginger and huge range of sauces..how could anyone not like this? I always out-do my bowl size for veggies but I keep stacking :P why not? (Joel's broccoli tip below is pretty funny, and I understand his thinking :P) Saying that the prices are reasonable and great especially if you stack high and take some home .  Some of my other favourites are: * the 'Asian Orient iced tea' (18+ drink) not sweet but good ;) \"Sticky Gooey\" chicken wings! almost like a wasabi taste too them. * BANANA WONTON dessert!!! OMG!  Banana wontons in vanilla ice cream with caramel and chocolate sauce and sprinkles of cinnamon,Perfect! My boyfriend isn't a dessert person so last time I ate the WHOLE bowl after my stir fry! ya that was a great night :P hahaha  So ya all in all I will keep going to Open Sesame! I've never had an issue with service and YES make a reservation if your going on a weekend, it is busy!  Thanks again Open Sesame and see you soon :)  *L"}
{"text":"I LOVE open sesame! Always an amazing time. Building your own stir fry is perfect as you get exactly what you want. Only tip is they recommend 4-6 scoops of sauce and in my opinion I would do 6-8 :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They give you so much food for so cheap and you get to choose what you want in your dish it's a cool experience and would recommend going to try it! The food tastes wonderful and really fills you up!"}
{"text":"I love Open Sesame.  I made a reservation at the last minute for my husband's birthday.  The staff was extremely accommodating.  One of my friends wanted to bring her baby and they made sure that there was a highchair for her.  The food, as always, was excellent.  The one trip around the Asian market is always a good bet.   I ordered some Vietnamese salad rolls which were very tasty too.  Our waitress was also very accommodating.    We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Had the lunch bowl on Sunday.  They have an open selection of vegetables, sauces, that you add to your own stir fry, stacking up the bowl as much as you can is quite an art.  Then the cook, adds your choice of rice or noodles with meat if wanted, within a few minutes a steaming hot stir fry is served.  We eat here a few times over the year and is always excellent."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday, at 11:00 a.m. I had read somewhere on another review that they weren't open until 11:30. I got their and they were already open. It wasn't very busy only one other table seated with three ladies. My wife, son and I all ate the $10.95 all you can fill in a bowl meal deal. It sounds like a good deal at first, but by the time you add on the \"EXTRAS\" ie: the scallops, fried rice, etc. things add up very quickly. Needles to say lunch with one pop, and one child's milk ended up costing $50.00. food tasted okay, but if you have kids I would suggest going else where they end up wasting most of it anyways."}
{"text":"I LOVE OPEN SESAME. I go here every time I come to Calgary, mainly because it is the only place I know of in Calgary where I can eat a safely vegan meal and my parents and friends can eat whatever they choose to eat without having to \"suffer\" a meatless meal.  First-off, this place just feels cool. The decor and lighting are great, as is the layout. Nice bathrooms. Feels like you're somewhere other than a crappy flat dusty ugly prairie city when you're in Open Sesame.  Second, they have a vegetarian grill! Yes! If you order a meatless meal, it won't have beef residue! This makes me so much more excited to eat at Open Sesame. I'm not a freak about my food touching meat, because I know it's going to happen, but I do prefer when it doesn't. You know, just because the thought of singed dead animal flesh is pretty gross to someone who hasn't eaten it in a decade. No offense to those of you who are comfortable with singed dead animal flesh.  You can order off the menu or construct your own stir-fry bowl. There's a choice of carb - a few types of noodles and three different rices - as well as a plethora of sauces. An allergy card is included at the bowl filling station that lists the ingredients in each sauce, so vegetarians are again (hurray!) taken care of without inconveniencing the meat eating majority.  Having eaten at plenty of grill places where I fill a bowl with veg and it's cooked up custom for me, I have to say that Open Sesame seems to have nailed it. The food is always well-cooked, never still-raw, and adding meat to a dish is something that is paid for based on the meat choice. There is very little that will make me more ornery than having to pay the same price for a veg dish as someone having that same dish with meat in it. The meat is the expensive part, after all.  Apparently I'm feeling long-winded today. Anyway, you should probably visit Open Sesame. The drinks menu is decent too, service is fantastic, and my dad will eat there without complaining."}
{"text":"Umm yeah, nice enough place but sadly the past few times I've been there the food has been horrid. I can't seem to make a good noodle bowl to save my life, so I tried the butter chicken. It came with the equivalent of 2 onions, you couldn't taste anything else. The calamari appetizer might have well as been deep fried salted bread...  At the same time, others I go with seem to love the place, so maybe I just have bad luck..."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with a friend and got through no problem. We were both immediately impressed with how NICE the restaurant was. The decor was beautiful! We ordered the 'Make your own stir fry' bowl for 10.95. I added beef to it for an extra 4 bucks.  When I went to get my veggies + seasonings, I really piled on the stuff I wanted to put in my bowl and hoped for best results. When my stir fry finally came, I dug in and was so surprised! It was GOOD! In fact, it was so good I could hardly stop eating it, even when I was very full. They gave me so much food that I was full after eating half the bowl. My dining partner on the other hand had too much sauce in her bowl, but it was tasty, she said. I took the rest of my stir fry rice to go, and I brought it with me for lunch today... Mmmm.. Its a practice of patience really, trying not to eat the whole thing before 11:00am...   I would MOST definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Decent food, decent price. I mean if you are itching for some Mongolian Grill food this place is better to go to than the Mongolia Grill, mostly for price. The Atmosphere is pretty great though, this place certainly has that going for it."}
{"text":"This place should change their name to \"Open Saltmine.\" My Blazin' Malaysian noodle bowl was packed with so much sodium that I was bloated and hating life after 2 bites. My sister and her fiancé had equally salt-tastic steaks. I liked their Neon Ninja drink though. And the chocolate spring rolls. To be honest, though, it's pretty hard to eff up chocolate. Unless you add water to it while it's melting. It's seizing! Oh noes! /tangent"}
{"text":"The buffet vegetables were not fresh.  In general, the quality of the food was quite poor.  I don't plan on coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"How the heck have I lived in Calgary for 3 years and have not been here before? We went with friends on a Sunday night - they recommended it.  Parking - busy lot but we found a spot - no paying for parking! I am thinking about all the downtown restaurants we skip due to parking issues. We did have resos just in case. The restaurant was not full but was busy. I loved the interior. It was dark, well decorated and sexy - really I thought, \"this would be a great date place!\" The name Open Sesame for this Asian-style eatery is beyond perfect! The menu is awesome - I could eat here every day for a month and not get bored. I was impressed with all the Thai choices (me loves) here and the prices were way below par from what I am now used to in Calgary. We started with the Seared Tuna - simply good. Then, we chose a la carte and got the Thai Seafood Noodles and the Kung Pao Chicken. Where else can I can an entree full of shrimp, scallops and squid for under $20?! My husband loved his chicken - it was cooked to perfection with just the right balance of chilies! Both dishes were very good but be aware that the Thai Noodles are more like thick Japanese Udon noodles and not rice noodles that for some reason I was expecting. Our friends did it right and created their own stir fry. They choose a few things with the waitress off the menu (meat, starch) and when they were ready, they went up to the huge wok and chose their own veg, sauce, nuts, etc and came back to table with piping hot, huge bowls of yummy looking food. It did not take them long at all. They made our little chosen plates look so humble next to their bowls. Of course they had leftovers too so if you are looking for value, do the stir fry. One star lost for service. Our waitress was sweet and attentive but was timid and did not have any menu knowledge. We would ask something and she would insist on running back to the kitchen each time to find the answer. She did not say that it was her first day but it could have been. I was impressed with the extensive drink menu as well as the dessert menu. We skipped dessert but I noted the desserts coming out were HUGE and at a low price of $6 each. Unheard of. Our friends got the Blondie Brownie with ice cream on top and devoured it. I would in fact go out of my way to go back to eat at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Some friends of mine were kind enough to bring me here for dinner.  The atmosphere was nice, quiet, intimate - a great place to catch up with friends.  We shared some spring rolls and samosas as appetizers.  I preferred the samosas.  For the main course I went for the dragon noodle bowl.  It was quite nice.  Noodles not too much sauce, and beef with various veggies I cannot recall.  Overall it was a good meal and I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I love this place.. the menu + ambiance is amazing.   great for groups too.. they can host a large group (just ensure to make reservations!)   This is one of those Calgary Treasures...it's not over priced at all..a great value makes for an even better night.  My only problem is.. confirm your reservation... I made reservations for a Friday night.. I called them to let em know I'd be about 10 minutes late.. they told me they didn't have my reservations.. I was so frustrated.. considering the guy told me earlier on the phone \"see you tonight\".. we ended up going else where - as the manager tried to make me seem dumb for thinking I had made a reservation - when in fact I DID!....anyways.. Saturday night comes around.. and I get a call about my \"reservation\"..not impressed at all.. I know people make errors.. but the Manager should have had better judgment and knowledge to check the following days reservations... take away: call back to ensure ur reservation is made correct."}
{"text":"Oh Open Sesame with your bad service... Just cause we have a party of 8 people and you tack on 15% gratuity, It doesn't mean you should have to be a lazy weirdo! Can you please give us some time to think about what we want instead of hovering? And then after we order we never see you again... we should have under paid you! Trust me, your service was worth about 4%.  However... Your meals are such a good price and because I pick my fixin's.. you dont bugger it up!  I think I also have more fun making a game of how much me and my friends can cram into our bowls without loosing any!  so my ordering advice...  start with: Wor won ton soup for 2 ($6.95)  then: Order the make your own bowl with shanghi Noodles and save your money and just go with the veggies only for ($9.95) If you order meat... you'll be looking for it like a needle in a hay stack  Desert: Its all good, but you should be stuffed so time to leave!  Pros:  Tofu!! and all the other choices! Price Atomosphere.. This place is cozy and impressive.. looks expensive  Cons: No same day reservations Service  I give it a 5 on the lick your lips scale....mmmmmm!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Open Sesame for over 5 years and its always the same. Great service, good ambiance and the stir fry is always really good. The interior is decorated really as well, which adds to the effect. I recently went there for a party of 20 so we got the big tent in the corner which was extremely convenient and even though our party was huge and we kept moving around, the server was really polite. The only thing i would suggest is to add something a bit more flavour to the other items on the menu. I have tried almost everything on the menu, and most of the appetizers are really yummy and the stir fry i could eat forever (lol..but thats just me (: ). But I tried the Thai Bouillabaisse once and it did not sit well with me.   Anyways, the build your own stir fry allows you to pick which ever items and sauces you want in your stir fry, as well as the type of rice/noodles and meat item. I would definitely recommend to everyone to try it out."}
{"text":"Food is on the over seasoned side. Recommendation would be to go for the bento box and choose the amount of sauce yourself"}
{"text":"Very unprofessional. service is horrible and food is disgusting. The spring rolls 8 dollars for 2!! They throw together some doughy noodles and top it off with huge chunks of raw vegetables. The noodles were over fried mom says it was like chewing rope lol mushrooms taste like rubber. You are better off going to edo. Would not recommed this over priced garbage food. Also the host told a family coming in that they only had 1 hour in there table because that table is reserved Lol the restaurant is empty and theres tables everywhere. Seriously dissapointing place"}
{"text":"The way you get your stirfry here is super neat, and you get to make it the way you want it. So thats awesome and delicious. but a word of caution, restrain yourself on the sauces! or youll ruin your own meal!. You pick the meat you want then you go and fill a bowl with veggies and sauces and they fry the hell out of it for you. RESTRAIN YOURSELF AT THE SAUCES or you will ruin dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is great, but as others hinted at you need to know how to pick the right sauces and vegetables and stuff for your stir fry or noodle bowl. Let me explain: Go for 4-6 scoops of sauce, don't mix and match sauces too much or it will taste funny. Their sauces are great with out being combined. I personally love the spicy peanut, Thai curry, and hoisin.  The desserts are incredible, and a very good value. I have tried all of them and my top picks are: Chocolate Spring Rolls, Peanut Butter Blondie, Black & White Brownie, Banana Won Tongs."}
{"text":"I was very underwhelmed by Open Sesame. I've only been here once before...decided to not do the \"buffet stirfry\" this time, and instead ordered the Thai Bouillabaisse.  The dish definitely had potential, but the serving size was far too small, the seafood was undercooked and the dish wasn't hot (in spice or temperature!).  I don't think this is a place I would want to come back to...there are so many other great \"hole in the wall\" Asian restaurants in Calgary to choose from!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and very good food as well.  My only issue is it is impossible to get in there!   I guess that speaks to how good it is, but it is frustrating when I have only got in there one out of the last four times I tried.  It's too dang popular!   I imagine it's a good problem to have, but they need more tables. :)"}
{"text":"Nothing original. Just your basic chain restaurant dinner food. Everything is a bit too sugary. The drinks are salvageable hence why I'm not giving it zero stars."}
{"text":"I'm partial to the stir fry bar.   I love the selection,  appreciate the vegetarian only wok for veggie folks and that it's not by weight like competitors do where you end up with a $30 stirfry and you didn't even get meat or anything expensive because you're a vegetarian.     I also LOVE LOVE the pomegranate green tea - it's not too sweet either.  Their brownie is great - but enough for 2 or more.   They should hand it out with insulin if a single person orders it!     My only complaint is how very slow service typically is - I always try and squeeze it in before movie or a show and I think I have lots of time and they find a way to prove to me wrong.   It's definitely not a place to go when you have a tight schedule."}
{"text":"Unless you would like a wait, be sure to make a reservation. Thank goodness they have a full service bar. We were able to sit & eat quickly with decent service. Since it was a Busy night, our meals came out before our appetizer and they kindly provided the app free of charge. I will be back - after making a reservation."}
{"text":"What can I say, Open Sesame is a crowd pleaser and a fan favourite! I've brought friends, family, and acquaintances here, and haven't yet heard a complaint. Of course, I always urge people to take a trip through the Asian market and build their own stir-fry. Some find this daunting. Others confusing. But after a quick tour with me, they know what to do.  I urge everyone to begin with the sauce--not too much, but not too little. I aim for anywhere between 3-5 scoops of sauce depending on how flavourful and saucy my cohorts enjoy their dinner. I also accept the challenge of trying to be upgraded in bowl size. I know this sounds terribly trivial, but I see it as a personal challenge to fill my bowl as much as possible to thereby \"win\" at the table when they bring our cooked food. This can be achieved by lining the outer rim of the bowl with a veggie that essentially expands the height of the bowl. Broccoli works well as does cauliflower, and once my mom used mushrooms with some success.   If dessert pleases you, I suggest the peanut butter blonde or the chocolate spring rolls--both are delicious and entice sweet teeth of all sorts."}
{"text":"We went there for a Boxing Day meal. The decor is amazing but unfortunately they didn't bother to heat the restaurant up and it was very unpleasant the entire meal. They said the heat had been turned really low over Christmas but despite this excuse it still made for an pleasant dinner (minus my company of course) ."}
{"text":"I have dietary restrictions and Chris, the manager and our waitress (I forget her name but she was amazing) were incredible! Thank you for taking my modifications seriously and showing us around the restaurant so we know where to book a table for future reference. I will definitely be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"If you're coming here, make sure you have an appetite. The stir fry bowls are massive. You pick a protein or two like I did, and then they give you a bowl to go fill as much or as little as you want with veggies and sauces at their salad bar.   After that, drop it off at the chefs station and they will cook it all together for you. It was a lot of food.   Going on a Tuesday it was not very busy, so definitely intimate."}
{"text":"Came here hoping for a semi quick lunch with the hubs. Was throughly disappointed with the experience this past time. We stood at the door for a good ten minutes as there was no host and no servers we could get the attention of. We've always known that service is slower here, but waiting an hour for a stir-fry just didn't seem right! The restaurant was fairly empty when we went, and the server did apologize several times for her slow speed.  We both opted for stir fry bowls, which took forever to get to us to fill. Once filled and dropped off, we watched as my food sat on the counter for 15 minutes getting cold. In the past I've tried to get it off the bar myself, but after being told no numerous times, I've learned not to try. We were able to speak with a manager during our last visit (which was another 15 minute wait as well) and get my meal compted as it had arrived ice cold.   Overall, the concept of the restaurant is great, but if they could crank up the service and the lights (its fairly dim in the restaurant) I think I would return here on a more regular basis."}
{"text":"READ ON FOR THE \"BROCCOLI\" SECRET...  Open Sesame combines a few of my great loves, namely: 1. Quiet places where you can actually talk to those you came with. 2. The ability to customize your meal and choose what you're putting in your mouth. 3. An opportunity to cheat the system in a big way. (The broccoli secret!)  I'll get to number three in a hot minute here, but for now, let's go through the particulars.  First things first, this place is set up all Mongoli-Grill-gone-classy. I like bringing friends and dates here because you can have a conversation next to a giant roaring fireplace and not have to compete with the UNCE UNCE UNCE UNCE of a terrible DJ (See my review for 1600 Bier Haus) or the autotuned drivel of top 40 radio.   Suffice to say the place is pretty swanky - nice booths, a big ol' fireplace, a cool layout. You might need a reservation on the weekends as this place can get kind of busy.  I've also got to stop here and recommend their Pomegrante Iced Tea. It's not sweetened, but unless you're some sort of 12 year old with zero class that shouldn't bother you much. Less sugar is good for you anyways.  But now, on to the single best part of this restaurant where I reveal THE BROCCOLI SECRET!!  Instead of paying for your bowl by weight, you just get a bowl and the mandate to \"cram as much in there as humanly possible\".   I like that. I like a restaurant that rolls the dice on my ability to take more food than I will ever be able to eat in a single sitting. And here, friends, is exactly how you do that:  Broccoli.  If you don't like broccoli you can use tomatoes instead, but Broccoli has those leafy tops that are dense and easier to stack. All you've gotta do is fill your bowl up as you normally would - but when you're coming close to that 65% mark, take broccoli and run them around the entire edge of your bowl. BOOM, SUCKA! Your bowl's ability to house food just increased by quite literally 50%. If you're really talented you can do a broccoli ring on TOP of a broccoli ring, but at that point your server might start to give you dirty looks.   Ignore them. This is your moment to shine. They enabled you. They created this monster. Run with it.  In the end, this is a great place for a meal, a party,  date night or just a \"need to pile enough food into a bowl to last for tomorrow's lunch and also the day after\" occasion."}
{"text":"Review #13 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012  I had high hopes for Open Sesame as I've always loved Asian fusion restaurant or dishes like PF Chang's (though it's always listed under the unhealthy restaurant list) or wings and burgers that have an Asian twist. The service was just ok. I appreciate being seated right away despite not having a reservation but we were seated at the tightest corner that it felt like we were dining with the party at the other table. I also find the entire place too dark - I had a hard time identifying the ingredients on my plate as I couldn't see them.   Ok for the most disappointing part of that night - the food. We tried the crab wantons which were really crispy but all I tasted was the sauce and none of the crab flavor. My husband tried the Thai bouillabaisse which didn't taste anything what was promised on the menu  - Thai green curry coconut sauce but all I tasted was cream with a pinch of chili pepper. I tried the Sizzling Chicken Katsu - the katsu itself was very bland and the sauce was just way too salty. We didn't try the Mongolian/Stir Fry area so that's for another update whenever we convince ourselves that this place can offer more."}
{"text":"Like I've said before, I've always considered Open Sesame a decent option and appreciate their allergy cards and separate veggie wok. However, the last couple of times I have visited, the service has been fucking atrocious.  A couple months back, I went with Tiffany N to Open Sesame on a quiet Saturday afternoon for lunch before a Heritage Park outing! Our server was grouchy and unwelcoming. When asked if there were any vegan friendly appetizers or anything, she responded very quickly and coldly, with a NO. That was fine, as the \"Go Stir Crazy\" bowls are usually pretty filling anyways. When our bowls were brought to us, she set them down and walked away without saying anything. I don't think we were checked up on the whole time otherwise.  Last night, made a reservation for family, and was sat in a far corner with stairs, the only table up there. It made for a nice quiet atmosphere. However, while our server was friendly enough, it seemed as though we were often forgotten since we were such a trek and it was a busy time. Two in our party had to join in a little later (which we warned our server of), and they sat at our table for about 20 minutes until anyone bothered to come by and offer drink refills or anything and noticed them. They ordered drinks. Server came back quite awhile later with their two drinks, no menus and one of them had to request one which also took awhile. We were finished eating by the time they had the opportunity to order, which is partially their own fault for being late, but I feel as though our evening could have been about an hour shorter with more attentive service, and I wasn't too concerned about our reservation only being for two hours at that point.  Also, on the note of food, while I enjoy the MAKE YOUR OWN concept, I find that allowing the cooks to throw everything haphazardly throw everything together on the walk allows for uncooked onions and garlic, and they generally aren't as flavorful as they could be. In the future I'm going to drag everyone's omnivore selves to Buddha's Veggie down McLeod Trail and they'll just have to deal with it. Totally over Open Sesame. Plus side though? I TRIED JOEL'S BROCCOLI SECRET. READ HIS REVIEW FOR DETAILS."}
{"text":"I would have been to Open Sesame sooner had I better luck with booking reservations when I actually wanted them.  It's a busy place.    I was here for a birthday party last night and we were informed beforehand that our table was reserved from 6-8pm.  Not once were we reminded of this, even after 8pm rolled around.  However, receiving our appetizers look a very long time and they couldn't have kicked us out if they wanted to, as we wouldn't have finished our meals.  The crab wontons were amazing.  I opted for the stir crazy experience for my main dish and ordered the brown rice and salmon add on.  It also seemed to take an extremely long time for my food to arrive once leaving it for the Wok Chef.  The salmon was good and the rice was perfectly done.  I tried the Tropicana cocktail, which had mild flavor and was a bit heavy.  I don't think I'd order it with a meal again because of the cream.    Our server was very friendly and handled bill payments well, as a few ladies in my party made it moderately confusing.  Open Sesame has a great atmosphere and despite the slow food service, I'd go back."}
{"text":"I eat at restaurants because the chef prepares food better than me. I was disappointed with my choices of sauce and veggies for the stirfry and how the rice pretty much dissolved into mush. Service and atmosphere was nice.  Very swanky seating and decor if that's what you look for."}
{"text":"So we came here for a friends birthday. I want to start my review by saying if I was only rating the service, They would get 5 stars. Our server was awesome. Friendly, helpful and did his best to make sure everyone was happy  I like the IDEA of this place. but I think they could do it better. I think for the price you should be able to come back and get  more. Especially when you're there for you first time and see how little you actually get  the food quality was great. but the portion was kind of weak for how much you pay."}
{"text":"Open Sesame has always been fantastic every time I've gone over the years.  Some said it wouldn't last when it first opened but here they are still going strong over 7+ years later.  I've done the Asian Market, which is fantastic in it's own right, but I always seem to land back on the ginger beef rice bowl.  Maybe it's because now that I've moved away from Calgary and can't get ginger beef anymore it's one of the few times I can get it or maybe it's just the fact that it's always crispy and delicious that I love it so much.  On a side note, this has always been a good option for birthdays by booking the tent."}
{"text":"Open Sesame has a beautiful set up with nice decor and an overall pleasant ambience. This was as far as the restaurant went to impress me. I found the \"build your own stir fry\" to be lacking with ingredients and sauces. The DIY stir fry had a set cost rather than by weight. This could be seen as a positive or negative thing depending on ones appetite. I was disappointed at the portion size of the various proteins as well (it was not worth the extra $4). The menu was overpriced and I found that the  serving staff was not very attentive. The food tasted good, but then again what doesn't taste good covered in garlic teriyaki sauce. I can't say much about the other items on the menu, but I don't see myself returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I went on a Monday night for the build your own stir fry. The service was pretty bad and this place is best for vegetarians because they hardly put any meat in. If you do go, the shanghai noodles are better than rice because they won't soak up the sauce."}
{"text":"I'm a big \"Make your own\" stir fry fan!  A large group of us met for some Open Sesamy goodness and it seems to be a place that can accommodate all palates.  Our server was actually really impressive.  She kept on top of everyone's drinks the entire time, kept up with everyone's orders, appies, and separate bills.  I started with some hot and sour soup, it wasn't the best I've had, but it's not a bad starter for 5 bucks.  I ordered the vermicelli noodles and bbq pork.  The make your own stir fry bar has a great assortment of fresh veggies including carrots, bok choy, celery, broccoli, etc and other canned goods such as corn, chick peas, pineapple, etc.  There is a great selection of sauces from sweet and sour to coconut thai, probably about 10 kinds in all.  Just have to remember to put enough sauce on!  The server made sure to let everyone know if there would be  a delay bringing in any stir frys, she was great.  I was a LITTLE disappointed that I didn't have more bbq's pork since it was quite delicious.  Everyone seemed pretty content with their supper and it was a fun experience to get up and chat while making our meals.  The pints were a great price point for about $4.50 for Keiths.  Overall, the service was my favourite part.  Our server split up everyone's bills perfectly, was very attentive and knew exactly who was eating what at all times.  There was a 15% gratuity on the bill due to the size of the group.  A friend of mine placed a tip onto his payment not realizing and the server was kind enough to come back and inform him, giving him cash in return for his excess payment.  I don't know if a lot of servers would've been as honest.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This is always a nice place to sit down for dinner.   It's a quiet cozy atmosphere. Great price for what you get"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this stir fry restaurant. I've been here a handful of times and have never walked away hungry or disappointed. I really enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant and whether I make my own stir fry bowl or order off the menu, it's always very good. Their cocktails are also pretty delicious and I do recommend them. About on par for price. The only thing keeping me from giving the place a 5 is that the wait time for a table can get to be a bit ridiculous, as it is a popular spot. I do recommend a reservation if you're starving and don't want to wait 20+ minutes."}
{"text":"A veggie buffett!  Nice!  and all I like to eat is meat.  My friends brought me here on recommendation and I am glad they did.  Great atmosphere, great people, and great staff.  My first experience here will definitely not be my last."}
{"text":"I like the concept of this restaurant but both times I have been here I have been disappointed. The lighting in the restaurant is awful- I guess that's the ambiance they're going for but it's extremely dark. The service is just average.   The problem was that the last time I was there they couldn't accommodate for my allergies. I'm allergic to nuts and sesame and every single one of their sauces contained nuts/ sesame. So I had to have plain noodles and veggies...which wasn't exactly satisfying."}
{"text":"If you feel like having some Asian food without a usual cheap-crap-sticky-tables-dirty-walls-stink-and-yell atmosphere, Open Sesame may be a right choice.  This place is quiet, reasonably expensive, and they have a chef, not a cook, working in the kitchen. Resulting food is professional grade, of no risky ingredients, and the portion size is fair.  They have a \"build your own stir fry\" buffet thingy, but I am not a big fun of DIY plates. Though idea doesn't look bad and may look even fun for someone.  My server was awesome, though a girl arranging the seats was marginally helpful. Even though the place was quite full, my food arrived fast and - let me repeat myself - was a mighty good stuff!  I loved almost everything about this place, even the chopsticks.  Two reasons not to give them five stars are unfriendly seating manager and rather shortish menu - but I can definitely recommend Open Sesame, and will be back there for sure."}
{"text":"Quality is not what is use to be. I had a margarita and we shared the furitake fries. I stopped eating meat for a couple of years and now that I am eating it again I've been wanting the kung poa chicken I use to get here.  So finally to get it infront of me, I'm sad to see its not the same.  It use to be very spicy! Now I would classify it as mild hardly any chili peppers in it. My rice was mush and my vegetables were steamed with no crunch. My peanuts were heated up but not cooked so didn't add anything to the dish."}
