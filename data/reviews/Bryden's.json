{"text":"Absolutely a jerk bartender who isn't even from Toronto....he is a Milton hack lives in Milton but they would never trust him at the commercial and main location in Milton. This guy serves his friends nothing more and tells u sorry last call has past. Meanwhile he serves his friends before and after last call ignoring the average customer"}
{"text":"Bryden's is my all-time favorite pub.  It has that feeling of hanging out with friends in your basement or living room.  It is comfortable, the staff are friendly, the beer there is great, and the nachos are legendary."}
{"text":"Love this place. Classic neighborhood pub, but better - it's a cozy little room with a huge range of beers on tap, two great bartenders who remember my preferences (when either of them is there, it's 5 stars!), and decor more like a 19th century living room than not. The plushy stuffed-animal sheep head mounted on the wall is a nice touch. Clientele across the board but mostly in the 20s-40s age range, with everything from a sad sack or two at the bar watching hockey, to chattering groups of twenty-something hipsters. Excellent food served long past most other bars' kitchen hours have ended. Great beer, low-key ambiance, and a yummy late-night burger. What's not to love? Downside: it can get pretty busy and it's sometimes understaffed. Also, one of the bartenders leaves a lot to be desired (for him, three stars). But all in all - excellent spot."}
{"text":"The only thing I need to say is the veal sandwich! If you want a giant piece on the bun, this is a great place to go. The atmosphere is alright there Wayton service staff are pretty good there's just a lot of great things to do here. Bathrooms and ambience are fairly clean."}
{"text":"Always great food and a nice atmosphere.  Good selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT BEER SELECTION

Best beer selection in the village.

Decent food, but I go for the brews.

Good atmosphere, good service.

Beer-wise, they have cask beers and roating draughts.  Tried some \"Black Oak Nut Brown\" the other night and loved it.  Two thumbs way up on the bevvies!"}
{"text":"One of our locals .... good beers and getting better [lots of stuff from Robert Simpson and Great Lakes Brewing] , groovy eclectic atmosphere, solid pub food, great sweet potato fries, toddler friendly, decent smallish patio, fair prices. A good indie place in BWV."}
{"text":"We went to Brydens for brunch because the wait time at the brunch place across the street was 1.5hr and we had already paid for parking. It was quiet on the Sunday morning but the server was really nice and attentive. I got a three egg omelette with a side salad instead of fries and my boyfriend got the eggs Lenny and we started off with nachos :P. 

The nachos were perfect and crispy. 

The omelette was good but I liked the side salad the most, it was fresh and the dressing was an aged balsamic vinaigrette that was perfect. 

The star of the brunch was my boyfriends eggs Lenny which was a smoked salmon eggs Benedict with crab cakes instead of an English muffin and jalape√±o hollandaise. The burst of seafood flavour was eye opening. The crab cakes were a mix of fresh and imitation crab and it complimented the salmon perfectly. 

The price was also very good, especially compared to most top brunch places that charge 12$-15$ for a eggs Benny and even more for seafood on it, while we only payed 11$ for the eggs Lenny. 

Overall the food and service were great. The interior is a real kind of rustic lots of new restaurants try to imitate. It looked like a local pub and not super fancy but the quality of food and service should not be underestimated!"}
{"text":"Bryden's is my go to in Bloor West. They carry craft beers and the selection changes on a regular basis. The food is good pub grub. THey have free wifi and a great atmosphere!

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Being a fan of cask beer I visited Bryden's with a friend who is always on the search for great watering holes.  This friendly and small pub at Jane and Bloor is a great spot for local beers, one cask variety and of course nachos.

I generally never order nachos and seem to have low expectations but Bryden's does a great job with them.  They somehow manage to layer cheese, sour cream, guac, and chunky salsa perfectly and those chips that are missed are covered in papikra.

Go Mon or Tue when apps are $6 and small nachos are included as a what is really a small meal.  You'll enjoy the great beers and excellent food.  Be prepared to wait if in a larger group.  Busy place with limited seating."}
{"text":"Walked in with a good friedand asked the bartender what hoppy beers where on tap, he replied \"we dont have any at the moment\" when I asked what is new on tap, he gruffly told me to read the board. Couldn't explain anything when I inquired about a few of the beers, was sarcastic and rude beyond belief. Ended up leaving and going to Shakeys where we were warmly greeted, and had a pint of hoppy beer/"}
{"text":"Great food. Great selection of beers. TV game is lacking"}
{"text":"Good food, excellent service.
Cosy atmosphere, a crazy selection of beers. I had the pad Thai w chicken, very tasty & filling. 
The man had the pulled pork, I wasn't a huge fan of the spice blend but he really enjoyed it. 
Over all a lovely place to sit & have a drink or a meal."}
{"text":"I've dropped in twice recently for pub grub, and a couple pints. T

The nachos are amazing. I repeat, AMAZING.

A few Ambroise Pale Ales and a wings were also shared by myself and my \"dining\" partner.  I passed by a table with a freshly delivered Chicken Parm Sandwich. I'll be most certainly getting that next time. It looked gooood. 

This place is in true pub form. Great service, super-nice staff. Eclectic bunch of seats and chairs. 

I like it. Most definitely will return to this quaint little place."}
{"text":"Great pub in Bloor West Village. The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. They were patient when we couldn't decide on drinks and took the time to explain the selections and made great recommendations. I haven't sampled much of their food.... yet. 

The atmosphere is definitely their best selling feature. The eclectic mix of furniture; combining couches for relaxing with tables for 2 or 4 and bar seating as well. It has quite a lot of seating considering how small the place is. I also love the different fabrics on each chair. Very homey."}
{"text":"Our go to place on Mondays and Tuesday's for their weekday deals and good selection of beers.  Service is casual and always friendly.  The nachos are one of the best of had!!! The only complaint is the bathroom as they only have one stall and it's not always in the cleanest condition, but they're always busy so I guess staff doesn't have time to attend to it."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service is so welcoming & attentive ! Nachos are delish !!!

It's a cozy place, dim setting .. Nice and intimate and casual :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday afternoon. The selection of beer is great. The waitress was very informative and knew her beers. Mondays special is 6 dollar apps. We tried the crab cakes and honey&jack wings, the crab cakes were not great they were made with imitation crab and the sauce taste like peanut butter. The wings were average nothing special. The drinks are best here and service is great. If not for the food it would be 5 star."}
{"text":"This used to be a brilliant place but now the furniture is dirty and the place smells. Food used to be good but has gone downhill. Good variety of beers here though. Would go back if the get new furniture and clean the place up a bit."}
{"text":"First rate place. Had a great experience here, just before the holidays as I was there for an industry event for craft beer reps. The place may be slightly smaller but the selection of incredible craft beer is HUGE. 

I really like this space, as I mentioned it a little smaller and right ON the intersection of Jane and Bloor (Bloor West Village) but it's cozy, a great pub for winter drinks especially if you're from the neighbourhood. Looking at it, it gives off the the look from the decor and furniture of an irish pub to give you some perspective. 

That however changes with the aforementioned beer selection (did they even have anything Irish ha ha), and the pub style food. I got a chance to speak with the owner during my visit and he gave me a history lesson on the place, telling me that when he took it over years ago it was his goal to bring a gourmet spin to traditional pub faves - something many people would call Gastro-pub fare. Brydens has been doing it longer and I'd dare say before the term was even a dirty thought. 

For the record I had the Jerk Chicken/Carribean wrap with spuds - just the right amount of spice, perfectly portioned and cooked. Delicious (Plus it absorbed my booze so I could go home and not be a mess the next day, so.... #WINNING)

I wish I lived closer to this place as it's definitely my kind of local hang out. Check it out if your walking in BWV!

Eatcrest Out!

PS - I forgot to mention, because they're a great customer of Great Lakes Brewery, they were one of a very few who go a special limited edition Egg Nog Porter (and only a small portion). If you're a porter fan you'll love this... it's CLEAR (picture a wheat beer in colour) but the thickness and smoothness of a porter and the taste of a cup of Egg Nog! Jumpin Jesus Craft Beer! 7+% ABV as well, it'll get you in the holiday spirit even if you don't celebrate!"}
{"text":"This place is very quaint and small. Has a very homey vibe. It's a great place to go both on your own and with friends. It has a good selection of beers and good for a night of comfort food."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here, and my favorite thing about this place is the beer selection. They also have a cool promo every Monday and Tuesday, $7 appetizers. I've always ordered the smoked salmon app, which is served with crostini and arugula. I got a little too adventurous with the menu and ordered an \"Indian Stir Fry\", which consisted of chicken, peppers and broccoli. I eat alot of Indian food and I made the mistake of thinking that it would be a typical chicken curry. The sauce is painfully thick, like Greek yogurt thick and half a serving of naan is not enough for the serving size. Other than that little adventure, I'd still come visit for the beer and appetizers."}
{"text":"Good beer but there's a lot of better places out there. Terrible service and food. Not returning."}
{"text":"Great place to take shelter on a cold winter day, or in this case cool down with a cold beer in the summer!  Love the crab cakes and all the finger foods.. can't go wrong.  Even sent a few friends this way when looking for something this way!"}
{"text":"I've been to Bryden's twice now and it's been excellent each time. 

The 1st time was just some beers with a friend and it was fairly quiet. The beer selection was awesome and the apps were very good. I highly recommend the nachos. 

The 2nd time was for my birthday and I called ahead the day of and was told they can't take reservations but they would do their best. When we got there the place was very busy but we managed to get a couple tables pushed together. The place is small and can't seat a ton but the wait staff were great at getting everyone what thy needed even if it took a few trips."}
{"text":"Considering Bloor West Village sports a pretty bumpin' night life (No.) I'd say Bryden's is one of the best pubs in the area... For what it's worth.  

Good ol' Bryden's has a very communal, pub-esque vibe. The hum of two flat screen T.V.'s buzz in the background. Soccer on one screen, foot ball on the other. 

The seating selection is limited, with a few worn out tables here and there. They have several vintage sofa's and arm chairs scattered about. The space is a bit dingy and the lighting rather poor. But with the right group of people, there's something about the atmosphere that just feels right. I think cozy is the right word i'm lookin' for. 

Cheesy classic rock songs are playing, over-powering the television's drone. I have no issue with this, infact, I love it. Nothing beats \"Living on A Prayer\" after a few drinks... Just sayin'.   

The pub's decor may not be the fanciest, but they have a great selection of beer. 32 kinds to choose from. Wine's also got a spot of the menu.  

They have a tiny patio out front. It's always full, but i'm sure if you arrive a bit early anyone could snag a spot. 

I order myself a Waupoo's cider. It's bubbly, refreshing and has a striking apple flavour. One of the best cider's i've ever tasted. Foreva' eva'? Foreva' eva. 

A co-worker of mine orders nacho's and the smily waitress brings over a heaping mountain of what look's to be some pretty friggin' tasty nacho's. Quac, salsa, sour cream, tomatoes, meat, cheese, god. I don't even know what else was piled on there. I just know I'll probably be ordering nacho's next time I stop by. 

The only thing about this place that was strange was the wash rooms. They didn't have \"Men\" or \"Women\" signs. Instead, they had weird, mer-people looking faces on each door. It took me a few seconds to realize which was the Men's mer-face and which was the Women's mer-face. None-the-less, SUCCESSFUL TRIP. 

I will definitely be back for another after-work Waupoo's cider. Woo!"}
{"text":"Went in to get a plate of wings to celebrate international chicken wing day, the wings seemed like they came from an anorexic bird which can be good or bad depending on your view on hormones. I like big wings so for me it's a negative. While I waited for my food which came pretty fast, I came to the realization no matter where you sit in this place, there is a tv to watch. The seating type has a wide range of seating types from sofas and arm chairs, to regular seats and a patio. The \"craft\" beer is technically not craft beer(the beer board has an interesting little story about it in small letters. As for the Wi-Fi it isn't open (which is best from a security standpoint) but it is free you just have to ask for the password and you should be given the password. As for the menu it is smaller before a certain time but the items are still available, so if you don't see it just ask if they have it."}
{"text":"When an ex gf and I moved to a house on Larkin, this kind of became our local when it time to enjoy a pint.  I've since been back and it is still a great pub.

The food is good.  Beer selection is great.  It truly as a \"pub\" feel to it if that makes any sense.  Nice cozy atmosphere in the winter and terrific little patio for the summer.

I recall the staff being quite excellent.  

If you are lucky enough to live in the area, I'd highly recommend it.

(Not sure I'd go out of my way to come here unless you are on a pub crawl or some kind of mission to try every decent drinking spot in the city.  If so, don't miss this one.)"}
{"text":"What an amazing neighbourhood bar!
Great selection of taps. A menu that really exceeds what you would expect from an unpretentious and cozy dive. 
The bartenders, Matt and Dave really add to the experience. Terrific dudes who know the craft. I highly recommend Bryden's."}
{"text":"I heard about this place years back, with Bryden's apparently being one of the original craft beer bars in the city before it became a trend. After a while of being curious about it, I finally had a reason to go for a drink at Jane St & Bloor and made a point of stopping in, and now I've even returned a couple times since.

The environment is somewhere between dive bar and ghetto living room, with the one  wall being comprised of vintage couches and coffee tables and then some 4 seater tables in the middle of the room and then the bar along the eastern wall. Its comfortable, and the furthest possible thing from pretentious which is probably appropriate for the area.

The beer list is really solid, with lots of great craft beer options including a variety of Ontario brews and a few imports. There are 7 rotating taps and you'll usually find some very interesting one off options. I settled in on a tasty pint of GLB's Thrust IPA on my first visit which was a nice unique tap option.

Food wise, I stopped in on a Monday which was $6 app night including $6 pounds of chicken wings. The wings were really good! A good size and the \"Very Medium\" flavour were quite tasty and just about the perfect medium flavour. They also had some more unique options like Jerk flavoured wings which apparently were quite good as well. Wings reminded me of the Wheat Sheaf. Another visit included a pulled pork sandwich, which admittedly did not impress.

All in all, this place is pretty cool. Food is decent, drinks were great. Although I'd still say this place is a bit below the caliber of some of the newer craft haunts, but once you go this far west, it's probably one of the best available."}
{"text":"Came here as the first stop to a craft beer hop for my partner's birthday. 

they have a decent beer list with GLB as their main focus. They also have flights to try a few 4oz pours!

Had a german pilsner to start the night off and some artichoke dip! Both were good and refreshing. The patio was small but sufficient for people watching. 

The service was consistent and friendly. 

yay for their 3-7pm app specials."}
{"text":"Bryden's is a unique neighbourhood pub that's hard to describe. It's not a pub like Duke of \"Insert Generic Name Here\"; it doesn't have big shiny booths and a fancy long bar or waitresses in mini-skirts. It's small; has assorted seating (couch, wooden chairs, a few cushioned, wing chairs and a small outdoor patio). They have a good menu of appetizers and main courses (from healthy choices to more pub type fare) and they absolutely have the best nachos I've had in Toronto (Axis nearby is a close second). It seems to have a loyal clientele coming in regularly from the Bloor/Jane neighbourhood. I was here twice this week alone and had nachos both times (if it wasn't so good I'd get other things).  You can seat yourself and the lone waitress is surprisingly efficient at managing the outdoor and indoor diners on her own and keeping track of orders and getting your drinks really fast.  Monday and Tuesday nights have amazing deals on pitchers of beer (Mon) and $6 apps including the nachos (Mon and Tues). There's a movie theatre right across the street which could make for the ultimate frugal date combination ($7 movies Tues night). I look forward to going back mid-month."}
{"text":"Short review: I'd come here for the beer, the atmosphere, some small bites. Would not come here for food.

And the extended: I like their beer selection quite a bite. They have some I don't see everywhere. They change it up I hear, which is great! Go here for beer.

As for the food, I don't understand why bars have pad thai on the menu. Unless it's going for an asian theme, stick to the basics.
I had the \"world's greatest nachos\"; if you gotta say that, you aren't the best. They certainly were not. They were ok. Good for sharing. I had the smaller of the two sizes. Definitely a good share snack and good enough for two who just wanna eat something with their beer.

The guys all dress like lumberjacks. The decor is basically beer advertisements. The bathrooms actually were quite decent; lit up well and not really as disgusting as many other bars.

They got a small outdoor patio though, it's on a main street so I guess can't do much.

Stick to the basics: nachos, fries and beer."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place but it was just ok nothing that we considered a stand out.
Basic wings and standard fare."}
{"text":"Ladies, if you like to have your pick of portly married men that have not seen the inside of a gym in 5 years...this is the spot for you. Totally chill local bar. 
Full of married men escaping the wrath of married life with kids; making it an awesome place for women who aren't interested in \"mingling\" (like me). 
A perfect refuge to drink with regulars who are there for the beer and nachos.
The mix match of furniture including sofas, arm chairs and easily movable tables gives it a cozy basement kinda feel. 
There's a robust and comprehensive selection of local and not so local craft beer, that changes regularly, which will excite any beer drinker (not me). 
Bonus: Due to the extreme male/female ratio (30:1), the women's washroom is always super clean available!"}
{"text":"A peerless selection of craft beers including  rotating cask ale.  Three entree specials change every week, and they compete against a solid pub menu of well prepared standards. 

I am not usually a salad guy, but the Maestro salad is the best in the city.  Mixed greens, with frizzled leeks, chicken, bacon, blue cheese and avocado in a lime vinaigrette.  Not light, but rewarding.

Kid friendly before 8pm, and a terrific option for brunch on the weekends.  Decent, but not optimal place to watch the game.  4 flat screens.

Terrific service."}
{"text":"This is one of the places that I miss the most of my old digs.  Found right at the base of Jane Street (at the Bloor end, you scardey-cats), Bryden's is one of the places that is gloriously independent, quaint, and non-franchised.  As such the menu is flexible and fresh, the staff is un-uniformed, and the place is just cozy.

The patio area is of a \"good luck getting a seat in the summer time\" size.  So, smallish.  If you lose out, the seating areas inside are more than accommodating where you've got options between table-style seating and couches or armchairs with coffee tables for drinks, food, etc.

This is truly a non-pretentious place to eat and drink, and the menu is completely reflective of this.  \"The Best Damn Nachos...Period!\", \"This Ain't Yo Mama's Fruit Salad\", and \"Nigel Benn's Auntie's Jerk Chicken Wrap\" all make the grade and are worth the trip to Jane Subway station."}
{"text":"This is going to be a quick review ( touch screen style)

They've just got rid of two imported taps for a rotating local stout. The other open tap has gone to a Waupoos cider ( prince Edward county).
And, there's the cask too....

 All in all, this place is one of a favorite local. 17 taps of craft brew, quite simply, is beautiful.

Other notes:
- different pub furniture deco: large comfy chairs
- HD Espn : watching Real Madrid v Lyon
- friendly staff
- didn't have any grub this time, but good pub fare"}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio overlooking Bloor west. The food is excellent with generous portions and very reasonably priced for this area. The nachos are claimed to be the best damn nachos period and love up to their claim with a huge dollop of guacamole included. Tons of cheese even down to the bottom layers. The wings were great and meaty. Love the ambiance and excellent service."}
{"text":"This is my kind of pub. It's just a great and relaxing place to unwind, watch a game and catch up with your friends. I love the schnitzel and pulled pork."}
{"text":"So first time in Bloor West Village and had no idea what to expect 'round here. A buddy recommended this place because of their Blue Cheese Dip so after walking West from High Park i finally found the place.
Small patio out front, just big enough inside. Great collection of paraphanelia on the wall, as well as enough lounge chairs if you choose to, well, lounge. I was here to eat so I grabbed a small table.
The server was over within mins and explained to me a few unique Great Lake beers i had never tried so I went with the \"Blind Faith\" which was good...but not sure if it was good enough for the $8.50 price tag.
The Cajun wings were more cooked in Cajun rather than seasoned and were good enough, but nothing special. Good amount for your $10 though, as far as non-wing night prices go. The famous blue cheese dip? Fantastic. Really, it was. Made in house she said. Thank goodness they use those carrots and celery sticks as garnish because I most certainly used them to scoop out every last bit of blue cheese from the tiny 1oz container.
Good pub for the village - and there didn't seem to be many, really. Server today was great, knowledgable and genuine inherent service. 
Would try again, hear the nachos are killer."}
{"text":"Great food and great beer.
What else do I have to say?"}
{"text":"This is my local pub - great selection of craft beer with friendly, knowledgeable staff and amazing food. Not a single menu item  will disappoint, order the nachos! Eclectic decor adds to the character of the place. Cheap apps on Mondays and Tuesday's."}
{"text":"This place was cute, very old and familiar feel to the place. Came in for a beer, the bartender was very knowledgeable. 

An older crowd mixed with student aged types, which was super cute."}
{"text":"Good selection of local craft beer.  I'm a big fan of wheat beers and they had side launched weis on tap. H-E-L-L-O! For the win!! Went their for a busy meeting and it was what you would consider a casual pub like what the Bishop and the Belcher used to be on Queens St West when it was still open some 15 years ago except much smaller.  Had the El Loco nachos with triple meat.  Perfect match for beer on a nice summer day.  If you happen to pop by Jane Station I'd recommend spending at least an hour here."}
{"text":"I wanted to post an updated review of Bryden's as I unexpectedly made it there again yesterday for only my 2nd meal there but for the 1st time I had their 'famous' nachos.  I found them to be quite worth their reputation overall; quite a generous quantity of food overall given the price and the cheese was well cooked as it was well spread over the other ingredients.  As yesterday was a Sat. and I arrived at dinner time, it was already fairly crowded and became packed while I was there.  The service, as usual, was pretty friendly and not too slow given the packed venue.  For my 1st time I didn't have any beer to drink while there (I had been drinking beer beforehand elsewhere) but nonetheless, Bryden's reputation remains intact with me."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pub in the west end of Toronto, if not the entire city. Bryden's offers true value to their customers. Not only do they offer great beer at very reasonable prices, but they also offer great specials on appetizers. This place offers great value while not skimping on portions or quality. On Monday's you can get a jug of Great Lakes Brewery beer and a pound of wings for $18!!!. That is a steal in an expensive city like Toronto where $18 will usually only get you the pitcher of beer. 

The food is very good especially the chicken wings, nachos, and burgers. Make sure to go for the pulled pork with the nachos. Good and attentive wait staff, shout out especially to Martina who will never leave your glass empty and effectively takes care of the whole seating area by herself on some nights. Great service with a smile no matter how busy it is. She definitely deserves a raise! Keep it up Bryden's! We need more independent joints like this in Toronto."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper Friday at Bryden's ... we hadn't been there since December.

It's a good pub if you are into craft beer.

We both ordered the Chicken Parm Sangwich.  ord got his with potato salad and no marinara sauce (he doesn't like tomatoes).  He said it was good.  I had mine with fries and no mushrooms or onions.  It was delicious!  I'd get it again.

Our server was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"some of the best pub food i've had anywhere, ever. sloppy, not gussied up, overflowing with rich, hearty ingredients with real flavor. for the prices, even, the portions are massive & satisfying. if you leave bryden's hungry, check your pulse.

service was pretty slow -- the waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed & overlooked my wife & i's table one too many times -- but the quality of the food was enough to forgive her. she was nice enough but had that terrified look in her eyes that hinted that her smile may turn to tears at any moment. i hope my big fat tip helped brighten her night."}
{"text":"3 WORDS -- PULLED PORK NACHOS!!!

Decent beer selection and good food with reasonable prices, it's a decent little pub at the intersection of Bloor + Jane... and if you're a nachos fan, I highly recommend the pulled pork nachos, traditional nachos with a good bitta BBQ flavour... get the \"el loco\" size and it's good for sharing."}
{"text":"One of my fav. local neighbourhood places.  

Friendly service, great beers on tap and tasty pub food all at fair prices.  Love the sweet potato fries with the maple whiskey flavor wings.  Weekday special is half price appetizers (try the calamari with wasabi mayo - also great!).

Cozy atmosphere in the fall/winter months and cute sidewalk patio in the warmer weather.

Definitely a shining gem amongst pretentious and expensive eateries in Bloor West Village."}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for beer selection. Full of interesting finds. Wait staff is consistently excellent, attentive, and knowledgeable. Minus 1 star for food. Nachos great, mac and cheese amongst the best in the city. Everything else, not so much. Get the Mac and cheese, it is seriously gooey exceptional. And relish in craft beer heaven."}
{"text":"Want to try interesting local beers and cask ales?

Want to escape hipsterland and just relax at a dive-esque bar? 
Bry-dens!"}
{"text":"It's kind of my local. Fantastic craft beer on tap, well above average pub food and hip customers. Prices are fair. This is the last true Toronto feeling bar going west. All others further west have a 905 smell in the air. One problem at Brydens is that they are chronically understaffed. Sure, the owner saves on having to pay another waitress and the one working her butt off makes good tippage but service suffers. Its also that all too familiar feel of \"this is just a job\" without the friendliness of bars like this in the USA."}
{"text":"Bar Crawl #6: A sip of Great Lakes Raspberry Hissyfit Grisette

I don't remember much about my visit to Bryden's and I know I will be coming back. The beer list here are all craft beer from local breweries and I like how they really featured Great Lakes Brewery, my favourite brewery!

The set up here is quite roomy with some sofa like area where one can lounge and enjoy your drinks!

Bryden's beer list is seasonal and on rotation, I just love surprises.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"They might sell a pint of Guinness, but that doesn't qualify this bar as an Irish pub. Disappointed."}
