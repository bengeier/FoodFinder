{"text":"Such a cute restaurant! Went there for breakfast - good coffee and their new potatoes were amazing."}
{"text":"I love this place. great food. great ingredients. The Churchill breakfast dish is one of the most delicious plates I've had in all of phoenix. My husband loves the bagels. I will say their macaroons are NOT worth $2... I got a persimmon flavored one and it tasted like butter and sugar. But I've enjoyed every other dessert/pastry I've had here. Happy Hour is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Best Mother's Day Ever! My wonderful children treated me to Phoenix Public Market Cafe for Brunch. What a treat! We shared the Del Real sandwich, the breakfast sandwich, the amazing peanut butter & jelly, and the hamburger. Every bite was a flavor experience, and I washed it down with one of their delicious cocktails. The cafe was walking distance to the Diamondback's game, so we swung back by after the game for more drinks and food. Atmosphere is casual and the place smells wonderful (like fresh vegetables, and wood smoked chicken...Yummo!). I love all the local merchandize for sale, and even bought one of their aprons. I will be back on market day to just hang out on the wonderful patio and enjoy a Farmer's cup or two.
Bravo St. Francis group, another successful restaurant !"}
{"text":"Only been here once, so they'll have to earn 5 stars.  Went with a friend of mine who suggested this place. He had the green chile pot pie, which I tasted and it was delicious. I had a rice dish with organic market vegetables which was also very, very good! I'm not sure what sauce they put on it but it really helped make the dish sing. It gave flavor to the vegetables without covering them up. I will say, for rice and vegetables $14 seems like a lot. However they were cooked expertly, & I really did enjoy myself. Beautiful restaurant with both inside and outside seating. I will be back! One note: service was friendly,  but a little slow. Also, when someone orders chips and salsa (we did) don't make them feel like a holes,  for asking for Xtra hot sauce (out server seemed inconvenienced by our simple request)"}
{"text":"Really good food, the burgers and fried chicken are excellent. Great drink choices and an awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is refreshing. 
I'm not into chains, mass-produced, pre-packaged food, which unfortunately Phoenix seems to be full of. 
I'm so happy to have discovered this spot (through Instagram nonetheless). 
The menu was overwhelming in a good way, so the cashier helped me out with my order and was patient answering questions. (Although she didn't know what savory meant?)
Sometimes when the point of sale is a cashier it can seem like you're on your own once you get your food. But they grabbed hot sauce for me and cleared the table, all while checkin in and striking up conversation. So great. 

Love this spot, and will definitely recommend to other flight attendants on layovers!"}
{"text":"Well, just left full and happy on an AZ Burger (beef burger with green chiles) and the pulled pork sandwich. Both were good-sized and flavorful on a good-quality bun. Delicious, cold seedless globe grapes as a garnish.

We also each had a pastry, and thought they were quite good.

A great spot for brunch or lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent tasting. The devils mess and the flash to wash it down. Well loved cooking shows in the food. Fresh and delicious! !!! Definitely a must go for just the right portions"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Super fast service. I tried the quesadilla which came with guacamole on the side. I loved it. I'm going to go back and try more of their food."}
{"text":"a great spot for a coffee or a quick beer. not cheap and the service is about a slow as it can get. it almost feels like the people working there are actually volunteers from a summer camp."}
{"text":"Very cool place! Fresh ingredients and awesome bread really makes their sandwiches delicious. I decided to go with the Rachael and I was not disappointed, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I decided on the rotisserie chicken with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and fresh market veggies. 
The chicken was moist and very tasty. 
Ryan provided excellent service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I normally am in love with this spot. I have been here for many happy hours and food truck events. The drinks are always body-rubbable, i.e. delectable and boozy.  The food is also very yummy, although the portion sizes may seem a little small.  The sweet treats blow my hair back each time. Today, I got the fresh banana bread and almost scarfed down the whole piece while waiting for the light rail. I did not; I have to watch my girlish figure.

Since I am always here for alcoholic beverages and food, I did not know that they do not give cup discounts on their coffee like several other local and chain coffee shops do. I always have my Starbucks tin mug that normally gets me .50-80 cents off, which can add up to a nice savings over time.  Well, they do not do that here and, the coffee was disgusting. I am a former barista and have traveled around the world and Phoenix/Tempe sipping coffee with my pinky finger raised, and this cup of coffee did not blow my hair back. 

Note to self: Never get a plain cup of coffee here, only delectable alcoholic beverages, food, and sweet treats."}
{"text":"Took over 20 mins to get a bagel served. Upon arrival, there was barely enough cream cheese for half of the bagel! Too bad  as this was my first AND last experience here!"}
{"text":"Nachos are great, the lox bagel is delicious, and you have to get a corn cookie (it doesn't sound like it would be good but it is). I like that they have free parking and a good variety of food."}
{"text":"It was a great, trendy place, with wide open areas and various restaurant choices. Really enjoyed the coffee, burger and fries!"}
{"text":"I went in for breakfast this morning and ordered poached eggs- over hard (yolk cooked through). We waited for a LONG time and when the food came the eggs were very runny. I pointed this out and was offered hard boiled eggs, as apparently they were unwilling to bring me eggs the way I ordered them. What I got was HORRIBLE! I was given 2 freezing cold hard boiled eggs that had obviously been sitting in their refrigerator for some time.  This is unacceptable. I was clearly not happy but was dismissed. I would never go back to this place - EVER!"}
{"text":"LOVE the food! LOVE the atmosphere! The service is great too!! Will definitely be frequenting this place!"}
{"text":"The mettle of a restaurant is measured by how the staff reacts when they mess up. In my case, after waiting 28 minutes for poached eggs, I went up to the counter to ask where my order was. I was asked to wait a few more minutes, so I questioned whether my order was even started (these are poached eggs after all).  My question was met with lots of attitude from Nicole, who was unapologetic and informed me that it \"takes time\" to sautee the vegetables (spinach LOL) that come with my eggs.  A little dumbfounded, I waited for an apology, a gesture of regret, an attempt to make it right, but that's apparently beyond the customer service capabilities of this place. So I requested my money back, went home, and had eggs ready in 90 seconds."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. I had the bbq pulled pork with a side salad. The bbq was great and didn't feel too heavy. Almost felt healthy! The salad was nice and fresh. Atmosphere was great. The thing I liked the most was the complimentary sparkling water. I never see that. There were a lot of good options on the menu that I hope to try sometime soon."}
{"text":"The food is always great and the staff is friendly. The happy hour menu is really good. We bring our children and they love it as well. We look forward to coming here every time we are in the downtown area!"}
{"text":"I work right across the street, so I eat here often. Everything I've had is delicious. My favorites are the rotisserie chicken and rice & beans bowl. I recently discovered how amazing their nachos are as well! The baked goods are also delicious, especially the macarons. I have been here for dinner/evenings as well and they do a great job with their cocktails. I highly recommend stopping by if you're in the Downtown Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I came in last night with my boyfriend and let me say, I will definitely be back. I've heard mixed reviews about this place but now I find it hard to believe those who didn't like it. I had the watermelon mojito and my boyfriend had the orange blossom beer. For dinner we split the fried chicken and the pulled pork sandwich. Both were excellent and I'm eager to try the other menu items.  Our blonde server who I'm ashamed to have forgotten the name really made the experience though. She made excellent recommendations and had a great sense of humor. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Phoenix Public Market Café is a definite \"must visit\" for lunch if you find yourself in the Downtown Phoenix area. I've already visited 3 times within the past month and each time I was not disappointed. The Market Café is located off of Central on Pierce in a recently renovated space that once housed the Phoenix Public Market grocery store. But instead of talking about the history, let's talk about my experience at the Market Café. 

During my first visit, I did a quick overview of their menu and ordered the AZ Burger just to play it safe. The AZ Burger came with green chile, lettuce, cheddar, and their house dressing. The burger was cooked well and the bread that holds all the goodness together is great. I was not disappointed with the burger or the service during my first visit. 

For my second visit, I decided to try something else and ordered the grilled cheese which is served on toasted multi-grain bread with sharp cheddar cheese. You're probably reading this and thinking that I could have made the same thing at home. You're right! However, what makes this grilled cheese awesome is the bread. Even though the bread is toasted, it remained a little soft and warm in the middle while the crust had a nice toast to it. In addition to the sandwich, I ordered a side of fries that also didn't disappoint. They were lightly salted and still a tad soft when they were plated and served. My second visit was a success. 

Can the Phoenix Public Market Café go three for three? You bet they can! I went back for a third visit and ordered the fries again but this time I ordered the chicken salad sandwich which is served with basil, pine nuts, arugula, and tomatoes all found between two slices of 9-grain bread. This sandwich packs some amazing flavor and some texture thanks to the bread they used. Whomever the Market Café is using as their baker, they should do everything in their power not to lose him/her. 

To date, my experiences at the Market Café have been positive thanks to the great food and service. Aaron Chamberlin has done an amazing job with the space and also brought a wonderful yet simple menu to the Downtown Phoenix area. By the way, If you have specific dietary needs (i.e. vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, dairy free), then this is a place you can visit and find something that suits your needs as well. 

If you are a supporter of local and enjoy good food, be sure to visit the Market Café at the Phoenix Public Market."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  The restaurant is is very hipster like inside.  Service started very slow.  Took several minutes to take drink order.  Ordered the sangria; had a good kick and was tasty.  we ordered the pretzel and cheese for an appetizer; pretzel with the cheese was bland and cheese was runny.  I had the Cubano it was pretty good.  wife had the fried chicken; lots of breading; some good seasoning but overall was not that good.  in the end I thought the cafe was pretty average."}
{"text":"Tasty drinks good food and great staff what's not to like! The Lee Trevino is excellent !"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food was great. The chickpea pancakes are a must. So light and fluffy and crispy around the edges. You can't go wrong with the vibe. Fresh and urban. Worth a stop when passing through the hot Arizona desert."}
{"text":"the food is great . once they know you they do converse, i feel phx. restaurants are usually not friendly unless you are a regular.......and that is from someone who eats out at least 4x's a week"}
{"text":"My husband and I had an early Sunday and decided to try Phx Public Market. It was a horrible. They were not ready for early customers; we sat at the bar and had to ask if they were serving drinks after 15 mins no one even said hello. Our waitress/order taker forgot what I ordered (her one job). We got the Churchill is was subpar I do not recommend this place especially early on the morning."}
{"text":"If I could this place no stars, I would. 

I've been there only once before and it was good, service and food were good. This time, we had a long day at work and wanted to relax and try something different. Should have went with my gut as gone to Turf, where I'm writing this review from. 

The bartender was friendly enough when we sat down, but that was the end of that. We put on our order and wait. Waited. Then waited some more. All the while, Our waitress/the bartender couldn't care less that we had gone about 15 minutes without our water glasses being filled up. Wasn't until we asked her for more that we got it. But even after we got our refills, still no food for another 10 minutes. How long does is take to make a salad an a burger? Even in a locally-grown ingredient establishment.

When I finally got my salad, I took a few bites and was extremely disappointed. The mix of tastes left me with the thought of turpentine. I know cabbage is bitter, but holy cow. I've never tastes cabbage like that. Or maybe it was the ginger. Whatever it was, it was horrible. I barely took a few bites until I couldn't do it more. The Chino salad was the wrong choice. 

I pretty much had it with the place by then. I didn't say anything because I was over it at that point and just wanted to get the hell out of there. We didn't even pay with her. Got a 20% discount as an ASU student though. Just about the only good thing about this ordeal. Sucks since I like buying local. Oh well. 

Never again."}
{"text":"Super yummy!!!!! I had the breakfast burrito. It was so good the tortilla was homemade and almost like a puff pastry consistency. If I lived in phx this would be a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"Do they not do counter service anymore? My wife and I come here 2-3 times a week for breakfast/lunch. We always sit at the counter and get service from the bartender. Today we say at the counter for a good 5 minutes while the two girls behind the bar refused to even make eye contact with us. The restaurant was slow, so I can't believe they were just too busy to acknowledge us. I finally got up and ordered our breakfasts from the main counter. If the counter service aspect of the place has been removed, maybe give us a heads up? Or, if your counter staff just can't handle 4 people at the bar at once, maybe it's time for a staffing adjustment."}
{"text":"The food is good, service is ok. I waited 20min for a toasted bagel with cream cheese, lettuce, tomato and avocado. For the bagel and a juice, the cost was $15. A bit pricey I think.
The last time I went, I ordered two sandwiches to go. The wait was again extremely long. And when I finally got around to eating my sandwich a few hours later, they had put the side of fruit underneath the sandwich so the bread was really soggy. 
I won't be going back"}
{"text":"It is easy and quick to order and the food is great. The environment is good for starting conversations and my BF and I enjoyed the time there."}
{"text":"The food is super amazing. I had the chicken rotisserie with Mashed potatoes. I am full but not feeling super stuffed. Zoe was our waitress. She has a great personality to go along with her beautiful self. The Sangria is so flavorful and went down smoothly. My husband had the bbq plate that was the community special.  The cornbread was amazing!!!!!  Can I say amazing again!!!!  No complaints here other than the glare of the sun. You must try this food."}
{"text":"Showed up at around 9:30 am on a Sunday with no wait.  Plenty of parking available and it was covered which was a nice bonus. 

Walk in, order at the counter and sit tight till your meal arrives. We waited about 10 minutes for our food to arrive. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. For this visit we choose ear inside because of the full patio. 

I ordered the biscuit and chorizo gravy which was amazing!!! I would highly recommend.  The gravy had a nice spicy kick to it which worked great with the savory buttery biscuits.  

Check this place out, it won't dissapoint."}
{"text":"I actually get a little sad when the food trucks are there on fridays and I can't find parking to get the chicken salad sandwich I crave."}
{"text":"Visited for breakfast on Sunday. Meal was just ok but the lattes were great. Felt rushed & cramped quarters. We were made to stand at the corner of the restaurant, \"until I'm ready to take your order & then  I'll call you.\" Restaurant staff were asking use to move out of their way until we were \"called for.\""}
{"text":"The Public Market Cafe is like going over to your friends house who's a great cook and eating. Its a little different each time and the service is friendly but definitely not professional. Since its a bit different each time I can understand why the reviews a bit mixed.

The fried chicken and prime rib are my favorites. Plus a small pitcher of beer (2.5 glasses) is only $5-7 depending on the type of beer your order.

I really enjoy the homemade, fresh taste here!"}
{"text":"Favorite neighborhood spot. Aaron Chamberlain really wowed me with his new restaurant. I love how he and his team renovated the space but kept true to the community as well as the name and the feel.  The food is delicious, breakfast favorites are the Devils Mess, Flarney Garney and Frittata. For lunch, the Chino salad or grilled cheese are excellent. For dinner, my boyfriend loves the pot pie and when decide to splurge, their roast chicken is so flavorful and moist. I also like their sweet potatoes and island bowl wih fresh blanched veggies, aioli and nori. Yum. Okay I'm drooling. The best part about this place in my opinion is that it's easy, the service is great, there are so many options for people with different eating styles that I feel comfortable bringing most anyone from my parents, to friends, to a visitor to show them a place that represents the heart of Phoenix."}
{"text":"I am so in love with this cute little cafe bar! I had their grilled chicken quesadillas with amazing guacamole. The chicken was medium cooked (just the way I like it) wrapped in perfectly baked quesadillas. The apple tart was good as well. But the best take of this place is the place itself. Being a student myself I found it more lively and fun-packed probably due to its proximity to the downtown ASU Campus :) Plus student discounts! Yayy"}
{"text":"So this is my first review and I am sure it is going to be the best cause this place is just awesome, actually I downloaded the Yelp App because I wanted to write a review about this place. Long story short best place ever staff are so nice and food is so delicious that you can't resist totally completely no your dish, let the pics explain before and after. I ordered the rotisserie chicken it was so good that I can simply say it's som thing BEYOND rotisserie chicken."}
{"text":"Super cute setting. Surprisingly easy to get a seat on a Saturday after the farmers market. Food was only ok. We had the quesadilla and the pulled pork sandwich. Sandwich was a little dry but the better choice of the two. Overall a nice lunch."}
{"text":"The service was prompt. We had the frittata & speciality sandwich. They were busy but not packed on a late Sunday morning. The food come out quickly & tasted amazing, hot & fresh. The fruit bowl was very good, definitely coming again."}
{"text":"Really your staff needs help.  Why does it take 20 min for black bean soup.  No one looked at me, I had to ask where the silverware was she looked at me and said on the table.  Well it wasn't I had to get it myself off another table.  Ask for water she just pointed.  The best part for me is I'm the head concierge at a large hotel here.  And trust this place doesn't exist."}
{"text":"I loved that it was relaxed enough we could sit with our dog on the cozy padded seating in front of a beautiful fireplace and enjoy our ridiculously delicious sandwich ( porkchetta). If you are a gingerbread enthusiast...which I am....their dark,moist gingerbread topped with molasses, candied ginger slices, figs, and currants was delectable and will definitely bring me back in the future! Easily the best meal I've had in months."}
{"text":"I'd go back to try the breakfast, but I wasn't overwhelmed by the food the first time we went. We got our order to go, so I can't comment on the drinks either! We shared a Roosevelt Row bagel and the Del Real sandwich. I would definitely get the Roosevelt Row bagel again, it was delicious and refreshing. The Del Real, however, was gigantic and there was way too much bread for my taste. I do love that they have a lot of vegetarian options so I'll give it another try! I guess I had pretty high expectations. The inside is adorable and the servers all seemed friendly too."}
{"text":"While I can't yet say how the food is, this was a great spot to take a break from the awesome market outside and have a cocktail! We sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive and the cocktail choices were varied and there was a wide range of beers and wine offered as well. the juices were fresh and on a busy Saturday the place wasn't noisy and the atmosphere very relaxed! The market outside btw is super cool also great selection of hand made items and honey."}
{"text":"The Cubano is amazing! The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I didn't personally check the establishment out. A friend picked up takeout from there and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this concept. It is remarkably adorable inside and has a great outdoor area too, not to mention it is home to food truck Friday - best day of the week! The food is pretty good as well. I love love the fresh and uniquely blended juices and the fact that it is all local. The owners of St. Francis killed it!"}
{"text":"Love stopping by here with the Postino crew.. Always smiling faces! Thanks public market ... Just die for these!!"}
{"text":"It's a great place for a small meeting, breakfast and lunch.  The staff is friendly and the coffee awesome... I love this little place, specially int he winter."}
{"text":"Limited breakfast menu, but what they have looks delicious. I ordered the Devil's Mess and the New Potatoes. More than enough food for one person - in fact, the New Potatoes order can be shared. What makes this place different from other spots in the area is the covered parking. Yes, free parking is unique for the area - throw in covered lot and it gets an extra half star just for that. If you're from Phoenix and endure summers here you understand."}
{"text":"Normally I love this place: I can get a delicious breakfast for about $10. Never had their dinner though, so decided to walk the 10 blocks and give it a try. Arrived around 8:50 (an hour before they close) and started looking through the menu. Had just decided on a sandwich when one of the employees sweeping the floor made her way over and told us they were closing at 9 because it was so slow tonight. I was irritated that they weren't staying open until their posted hours and the fact that the employee took her time in telling us made it worse. It wasn't even 9 and we couldn't even get a soda - I'm guessing the registers were closed too. All we got was a sorry and a condescending reminder that they were open again in the morning, which didn't really do me any good tonight. Come for the breakfast, just know the hours are apparently dependent on the employees' whims"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here for a late afternoon lunch on Sunday, and really enjoyed ourselves. My soup and salad were fresh and excellent - exactly what I needed after eating bar fare the previous night! And my husband's sandwich and fries were delicious as well. Everything just seemed so light and fresh - I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Really hip atmosphere. Great food - with food flavors. They seem really busy all the time...I passed by there maybe two times during the day and it seemed packed. I ended up ordering take out for dinner and it was still packed for dinner. Unfortunately, I didn't have the best experience ordering. I waited a while at the door to be seated...but no one came or even explained if it was open seating. Finally I asked some one and they pointed to the back saying...order there...really vague...I ended up standing there too while the cashier was talking to some girls (seemed like she knew them personally) I had to again assert my presence...and that's when I decided to do take out . The food was great but the service  very lacking.....even if it is busy, don't ignore customers. At least acknowledged them."}
{"text":"Love this place wonderful vibe...with the Bestest Freshest ingredients... Amazing Deserts  and I have tried mostly all of them !! 
No crummy processed food !!  All natural made by nature !!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food and coffee is super delicious. The staff here were also friendly and provided great customer service."}
{"text":"Went last Monday for $9.99 Community Night Menu, happy hour drinks and half price bottles of wine. Can't go wrong with any of this. Service is great & the food is fantastic.  Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great coffee, terrific staff and some of the best people watching in the area. I particularly like the indoor/outdoor bar and the commitment to quality ingredients.  Also, the Devil's Mess. My stomach hates me for hours later, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Economically priced, suave hip ambiance without that irritating \"too cool\" feel.   The service was impeccable from start to finish.  Our server was the nicest guy and so attentive filling our waters, explaining the cocktail list and the evening specials.  The sweet lime yams we TO DIE FOR.   I accidentally ate vegetarian the whole meal without even realizing it. That's DAMN good news.   The Phoenix was a tasty cocktail and their happy hour is reversed after 6pm?  either way..allll night.    Def worth a try..  Oh ...and the pretzel with jalep chedd....get IT!!"}
{"text":"My 1st visit was delightful. Service: friendly and responsive; my request  to split the 1/2-chicken meal with a friend was readily acquiesced. Food: flavorful, delicious, promptly served. Although I found the broccoli bland, the chicken, garlic mashed potatoes and beet salad broke the flavor barrier. I only wish I had had room for one of their inviting desserts."}
{"text":"I went here for coffee on a Sunday morning.  This place is amazing the coffee was a strong and great.  Every single staff member that i came in contact with was fantastic.  

I can not wait to try this place for breakfast or lunch.  My only complaint there is not enough seating."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is super cute and inviting. I ordered the salmon and it was very flavorful. We also ordered the rainbow salad as an appetizer but I was disappointed when I discovered that the bowl is full of spinach and just topped with assorted veggies for dipping. We brought back some pop tarts and a corn cookie and they were awesome! The downside of our visit was the service. We were the only family dining there at the time (Thursday around 6pm) it was mostly groups of co-workers grabbing some after work dinner and drinks. The atmosphere was pretty loud but I didn't mind it. Anyway, we only saw our server 3 times throughout the course of our meal; when he got our order, brought us a to-go box, and then the check. Never checked on us to see if we needed anything and never even offered refills. It was quite disappointing since he was also working on the table right behind us and he was constantly there chatting it up with them and offering food suggestions, explaining the menu, and checking up on them every few minutes. I would say he checked on their table at a 3:1 ratio in contrast to us. I wouldn't mind going back because like I said, the food was good, the ambiance was nice, and the hostess was really sweet too. It was just that one server."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite eateries downtown.   I've accidently eaten vegetarian 9 out of 10 visits and felt fully satiated upon leaving.  The cocktails are mixed to utter perfection, and the lime buttered yams are simply OUT OF THIS WORLD.


Get your butt's in there and prepare to drool, your salivary glands will certainly be depleted."}
{"text":"What a wonderful concept for downtown Phoenix.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"What a great little spot in Downtown Phoenix. We were just passing through and thanks to Yelp, we found this gem. The food was fantastic: eggs, pancakes and the corn cookie was heavenly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My third time here and I really enjoy this place.  I've had dinner once and breakfast twice.  The granola, yogurt and fresh fruit is delicious.  Fruit is fresh and tasty with a good balance of yogurt and granola.
The oatmeal risotto needs a bit more flavor.  A little too bland for my liking.
I can't place my finger on it but the coffee section is a disconnect for me.  Order food at the front, go stand on the other side of restaurant for your coffee.
The coffee is fabulous.

The staff is friendly but some appear to be very overwhelmed but that's the growing pains of a new restaurant no matter where and no matter how long the owner has been in business.

I like it and will continue to come back.  I love the small retail section and I always buy something from that area.  It's all made locally."}
{"text":"Really great feel to the restaurant. Definitely hipster. Food was really good but didn't like their sangria. Great place to go if your downtown for happy hour."}
{"text":"The food is great and always fresh. The service is good too. They have a bar area to grab a drink. They also have TVs"}
{"text":"Ordered the Del Real Sandwich with a cold brewed coffee, loved it! The onion marmalade was delicious and the veggies were fresh. The portion was normal with a pickle and watermelon on the side. My friend ordered the frittata and the pesto sauce was amazing! She also enjoyed a cold brewed coffee and be sure to get some Macaroons!

I gave four stars because I'm not a fan of ordering at the counter, I would prefer to be waited on."}
{"text":"Nothing like being swept away in an open space among strangers.

not sure if that even makes sense.

what makes sense, however, is the fact that Phoenix Public Market Café i posses a super chill vibe coupled with good, fresh food. 

almost felt as if I was not in Phoenix as the open, airy and relaxed space will do anyone good. was a great setting for a first date!"}
{"text":"The Porchetta sandwich is delicious!  Try the green chile burger and make sure to save room for dessert!  The staff is fun and friendly.  Get there early if you want to try the Porchetta on Fridays or Saturdays!"}
{"text":"I found this place not too far from my hotel while on vacation. I tried a lot of good places while here but this quickly became my favorite. The food was phenomenal. Service was excellent, in fact amongst hundred of people that file in each day I'm sure, one of the guys recognized me and said welcome back. The macaroons are some of the best I've ever had. Their farmers market on Saturday mornings is excellent as well, too many things I couldn't bring back with me on the plane. Too building and set up they have. Highly recommend and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Love the laid back atmosphere. I go there to get some studying and reading done about once a week. I haven't eaten too many things from the menu yet, but every I've had has been delicious. The staff is very nice and friendly. So happy I found this place."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I'm blown away by how amazing the food is. Great food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food...truly enjoyed everything we ordered. This was an excellent spot to grab lunch with the family over the weekend, and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place, I really do. The 3-star review is for the service. Every time I've come to PPM, they mess up my order. I keep going back but usually something gets mixed up. Having said that, yummy food (once it's correct) and the pastries are delish! Great atmosphere and they often have food truck events in the parking lot."}
{"text":"We were heading downtown on the lightrail to a D-Backs game and decided to go early and try Sunday brunch at this little cafe just a mile or so north of the stadium. We were greeted by super-friendly servers and were instantly charmed by the decor and set-up. The dining room was full so we sat on the patio. We placed our order at the counter and didn't have to wait more than a few minutes for our drinks. I tried the Melon Mojito- YUM! Our food arrived rather promptly as well and my frittata was delicious as was my boyfriend's pulled pork sandwich. Great service, great food, cute atmosphere. I definitely recommend this place for brunch or lunch!"}
{"text":"Oat risotto is amazing! Perfect balance of oatmeal, nut medley, and fresh fruit. Topped off with a pair of fresh danishes and an almond milk latte... Eaten outside in the sun... Perfect welcome to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Was really excited about this place when we saw it was opened. What a mess. The overall problem, as others have noted on here, is that it has so many concepts, it's confusing. For instance, I'm still not sure if I order at the pastry counter if I want to sit at the bar (is this a bar? a fastfood restaurant?).

Anyway, my wife and I went for lunch. Arrived around 11:30 and were greeted at the door by a guy explaining how to order (which was much appreciated). Ordering still was pretty chaotic. At the end of it, we were left to carry our number, my beer, my wife's iced tea, a to-go cookie, and a plated cupcake without a tray. I was worried about dropping stuff, because it's a big space and I didn't have the best grip on my beer.

Then we hit the second problem: there was no inside seating because all the inside tables, including the six-top picnic tables, were taken up with single people working on laptops (so is this a coffee shop?). The only open inside tables were a couple of tree stump looking things with low benches and a patio chaise lounge. So we went outside on a day when it was 93 out and we'd just walked five blocks. Which is fine, I mean I don't like eating outside in Phoenix because of how hot it is, and I certainly don't think my wife and I would have ordered a hamburger and a chile verde potpie if we had known we were going to be outdoors.

Anyway, so we sit down. There are as few tables outdoors as indoors, because most of the outdoor seating is taken up by a long picnic table being used by a guy on a laptop again and a couple of benches in front of the fireplace that no one was using (again, is this place supposed to be a bar?).

Our food comes out. We had already decided, hot and annoyed as we were, that if the food was good, we'd be willing to overlook everything else. It wasn't good. My burger was fine, although the brioche bun was either based on a terrible recipe or, more likely, a day old roll, as it was very stale and tasted old. Additionally, the bun was about an inch bigger than the burger, so I had to eat through all that stale bread to get to the patie.

The chile verde potpie my wife had was less disappointing but still not good. The pork was well cooked and very tender, but the chile verde was very clearly red and heavily seasoned with chili powder. While there were some chopped green chiles floating in the mix, it mostly tasted like Easterner's idea of chili that has been cooked in a crock pot all day. Which isn't to say it was bad, far from it. This was very good chili, but don't call it chile verde if it isn't made out of green chiles, onions, and pork. Again, it's not that the dish is bad, it's just not what my wife wanted or thought she was getting.

Also because we were both so hot from our walk and sitting on the porch (in the sun, I might add), we didn't finish our meal. We never got water, nor did we ever see where we were supposed to get it. I'm guessing from other reviews that I'm supposed to get my own water, but given that we barely made it to our table as it is, I'm not sure how that would have happened.

All told, the food wasn't fresh or prepared as described, most of the seating was taken up by coffee shop patrons, and the experience was confusing. I think most of the problems with this place result from it trying to be a coffee shop AND a bar AND a restaurant, while not being particularly good at any of them. Moreover, there are much better coffee shops, bars, and restaurants downtown. That said, I think some of these problems could be fixed by better seating arrangements and clear signage. Also, I think the owners should seriously consider ditching the confusing counter service and just run the space as a normal restaurant."}
{"text":"The Del Real Sandwich was well-proportioned and had a rather full and rich flavor for a vegetarian sandwich.  However, I quickly became jaded with it by the second half.  The Angelhair Pasta was appropriately spicy and the Southwest Black Bean Soup was adequate.  All in all, the ingredients were fresh, the preparation of the food was on point, and the service was quick.  The restaurant itself has a rustic meet urban look."}
{"text":"Breakfast, lunch or dinner - you can't go wrong at this urban relaxed hangout downtown.   It's open -- we've frequently shared benches and tables with other patrons and the location has patio seating.

The Phoenix Public Market Cafe supports local farmers and vendors.  For breakfast - I've had the Devil's Mess - eggs, fresh veggies, chorizo and chiles and the Fresh fruit with Oatmeal and Yogurt.  Both are delishish!    Any of their sandwiches are fatastic as well!

Plenty of free parking available as well!"}
{"text":"Unique, delicious food with stellar customer service. This is a \"must try\" if you're in Phoenix. 

We had the rotisserie chicken and the cubano. The rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes and roasted veges exceeded all expectations - not your average rotisserie chicken! The cubano with lentil soup was one of the best soup and sandwich combos I've ever had. The staff was helpful, friendly, and generally just fun to speak with. Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"I went here today for a belated Mother's Day Lunch and loved every minute of it. My mom ordered the egg white frittata with a side of potatoes and I ordered the rice bowl and added chicken. The ambiance is very warm and inviting, it reminded me a lot like Portland (my old hood). The servers were very friendly and helpful. I will definitely  be back for breakfast,lunch,dinner,coffee, and desert."}
{"text":"7pm - dinner outside was a good time! We had Poblano chicken pasta special and rotisserie chicken. Both prepared perfectly. Sid helpful and cool."}
{"text":"Very fresh food and cozy, cool atmosphere. Awesome selection for lunch! Would recommend for visitors and locals alike."}
{"text":"Delicious, good prices, good quality food. Great vibe- for a nice date, happy hour, or even studying with a coffee.

These people care about good food and good service.

Definitely planning on being a regular."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. We came here one Saturday evening and the place was dead for the most part. We both ordered some drinks, burgers and a ceasar salad to split. Everything was good, but nothing to rave about, and it was very empty which seemed weird for a Saturday night.

I'm a big fan of St. Francis so I really expected more. I think I'd like to come back for breakfast when they have the farmers market happening and give it another try."}
{"text":"Rating is based on the refreshingly delicious Lee Trevino and Sangria Drink, the service (bartender), and the vibe. 

Great place to hang out! It's on the list for a return visit and maybe this time trying some food."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Definitely will be coming back for the delicious burger for lunch"}
{"text":"I go here each time I am in town for work. Easy parking (usually) and a big selection on the menu. I've been here on my own and sat at one of the bench tables. They have wifi and plenty of people are working as they have their meals. It's a mixed (work, casual dining) crowd. Options for vegetarians and healthy eaters. Plenty of options to treat yourself too."}
{"text":"Awesome, delicious, fresh food and super friendly staff!! Love the industrial feel of the space. Can you open a place in Oakland?"}
{"text":"The restaurant was nice but wasn't impressed with their food or prices. Small portions so you'll leave hungry lol."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner at a great price. Everything was fresh and the atmosphere was fun and energetic. I had the meatloaf and it was amazing. The sauce was spectacular. I will be visiting a lot."}
{"text":"This cafe is brilliantly designed and the food is fabulous. You go up to the tills to order but its table service from there. The refillable water and lemon   especially lovely and refreshing in the heat. I had the pulled bbq pork burgers which was delicious served with a quarter of a pickle and a slice of watermelon. Lovely atmosphere along with the brilliant food and service."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is comforting. It's an eclectic atmosphere, generally mellow, that isn't marred by television screens or pounding music. 

We come here when we treat ourselves to the attached farmer's market on Saturday morning. We also recently discovered the dinner special on Sunday and Monday evenings where you get a deeply discounted three course meal for $12.99. And that's why we are here tonight.

Every employee is friendly. It's striking. They are kind and helpful. For someone who tries to follow a paleo diet I do need to feel comfortable with a server to ask for what I want. That has never been a problem here. 

My favorite meal so far has been the roasted cauliflower. Tonight I am trying the rotisserie chicken. It was very moist and flavorful. I requested the sides sweet potato with lime chili butter and steamed broccoli. The flavor on the sweet potato was outrageous. I think I have a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Six of us came for dinner. Great experience! Had the community night specials, including the awesome fried chicken and bbq pork/chicken plates. Everyone thought the food was excellent. Dessert was included, which was organic homemade soft serve ice cream. Our server was attentive and friendly. We will all be back soon! I want to try breakfast and lunch. Parking free."}
{"text":"Amazing find! Such good, fresh, and amazing food. The ambiance is relaxed. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent late breakfast spot. Ask for a habanero latte! It's not on the menu, but it's always available."}
{"text":"Great food, specials and service.  Kaitlyn had served us the last few times and is great!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing the quality for the price is great as is the service. But their student discount only applies to ASU students. This ridiculous rivalry between A ASU/Phoenix and U of A/Tucson has got to stop. This business should be above that I expect better off this awesome local restaurant. I gotta say this has left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"The Phoenix Public Market is my go to spot whenever I am hungry. The first time I came here I ordered an iced chai latte and I can't stop myself from coming back for more. Whenever I come here, the service is always amazing and the atmosphere is great. Prices are fair and the food is healthy and yummy! My favorite server here is Amber, she makes you feel right at home and recommended her favorites on the menu (which were delicious). Overall, this is definitely a place to visit if you're looking for something healthy to fill you up."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  This place is perfect for college students.  I was able to sit there and finish up some assignments - there is free wifi, get down on some coffee (They even brew cartel coffee!), and enjoy some great food! Located right by TAYLOR PLACE and DOWNTOWN ASU campus & it's just a short walk from Roosevelt row for FIRST FRIDAYS.  The location is prime.    

FOOD:  Their vegetables are ultra ultra fresh and their ingredients are all great quality.  They get their stuff from the neighboring farmers market and you can taste the difference in the food when compared to other places.  The chicken is just tempting you as you walk in as they have them rotating in the over right by the cash registers.  I had that, some garlic mashed potatoes and a sweet potato - my life changed. 

DRINKS: They have some really nice selections available on draft and they have good deals on margaritas and sangrias available by pitcher. I have to say - nothing compares.  Freshly squeezed juices and real fruit - none of this margarita mix BS.   

SERVICE/STAFF:  The service was exceptional.  They made sure I had everything I needed when they brought me my order.  The managers and the owners are really nice people.   The layout of the cafe creates a sense of wonder for first time visitors because there is a bar/coffee station, cash registers straight ahead, people eating, yet no servers. They did a good job at explaining the restaurant concept, what they are going for, etc.    If you sit at the bar, you can get FULL SERVICE.  Otherwise you can grab a menu, order at the register, grab a number and sit down - they'll bring it to you.  Pretty neat.   

Give this place a try.  You WILL NOT be disappointed.  A nice mom and pop shop that should get more support and credit for sure!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great food with local ingredients and not too expensive for what it is. I would recommend the rice bowl, soups, pretzels, and especially the sandwiches because the bread is amazing. Absolutely great. Great little place with outdoor seating and funky indoor seating. Fantastic food, great joint."}
{"text":"This place is still my go-to! The fried chicken is legendary. The service is always top notch. A few weeks ago a few friends and I strolled the Saturday farmer's market then went in for a bite and had to wait a pretty long time for a burger (since it was a Saturday at brunch time); we were promptly given a gift card for waiting, and we weren't even that upset! So yeah, this is a classy joint with a cool atmosphere and solid dining. A few other observations: they do a good job or mixing up the specials and pastry options. Those damn homemade poptarts always get me!"}
{"text":"It was just average. Husband and I had the Roosevelt Row bagel and the AB&J sandwich. I think that a lot of the items are store bought (almond butter, guacamole, hummus) and I probably could've made them better myself at home. The bread on the almond butter sandwich seemed stale. Not horrible, just meh. However, the ambiance was lovely, and the staff was friendly. We got a free cookie with the yelp check in, and my husband thoroughly enjoyed the chocolate chip!"}
{"text":"Today was my second time to the cafe, first time for dinner. The last time i was here it was crazy crowded for lunch and I remember enjoying the experience. Tonight was quite different. For a Saturday evening the restaurant was mostly empty and seemed very slow all around. Not many staff members present. My table ordered an appetizer and meals right away. We were brought the incorrect appetizer (totally fine) which was fixed quickly. The appetizers of Devil Fries were definitely nothing special, especially compared to some of the other local spots French fry delicacies! The coleslaw as a side with my meal was also extremely bland. The food was a pretty good \"meh\" but the two stars is for the service. There was a food runner and bus boy, yet our actual server \"checked\" on us once. Never refilled drinks, took an extended amount of time to even bring the check (we ended up just giving him a card without getting it first just to speed the process up) With a ton of places to go within walking distance with comparable, if not better prices, I will skip out on dining in the cafe next time. I love the idea and the local farmers markets and food truck festivals they put on, but the service and lack of quality and care really turned me off this evening."}
{"text":"Ordered the special- Denver Omelette, toast, and potatoes. The toast was dry- not served with butter or jelly. The ham and eggs were good, no onion (which is expected in a Denver), the peppers were raw and huge chunks. I would prefer more diced peppers than roughly chopped. The potatoes were excellent. Cute little place with a cool vibe. Nothing great, nothing terrible."}
{"text":"Such a cool place in the heart of downtown! The food is high-quality and delicious, with a menu for every taste. The pulled pork sandwich is the best one I've had in Phoenix (AND it's part of their $5 happy hour!). The rice bowl is amazing if you're craving something satisfying and healthy that's not a salad. Vegetarian nachos are sooo tasty, even for a non-vegetarian....... 

UPDATE: I am updating my review from 4 stars to 5.... because my one disappointment was the Lee Trevino cocktail, which (for some reason) became barely spicy.... but it has been fixed!  It is spicy again! And so delicious! Everything is so incredibly yummy!"}
{"text":"Scrumptious food, fast and friendly service, fun atmosphere. I've loved breakfasts here and this was my first dinner. I love the Flarney Barney for breakfast, and my dinner was just as good if not better. Mmmm, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I am impressed. Especially with the coffee. The cold brew I had was better than they even make in house at Cartel (public market uses Cartel beans). I was expecting it to be like any other restaurant coffee: mildly drinkable. However, I actually asked for an extra cup without ice to take home for the next morning. The burger was astounding, the open face almond butter+apples+jam sandwich was perfection. It's a place I'd like to go for a cocktail with my friends at night, but also I place I can imagine spending time in the afternoon studying (they have outlets at every table!!). 

A great addition to downtown phoenix."}
{"text":"Great burgers, but it can get a little hot in here during sunset hours. I'd definitely recommend a stop here, especially for a happy hour."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. The potatoes were drool-worthy and I haven't stopped thinking about them since."}
{"text":"Food is good and service is great. You will want to try everything here...and you should ... who am I to stop you ... I am just an ambiguous Yelp review. Have some iced tea and a sandwich... oh and Pop Tarts. Period. Done. mmm"}
{"text":"What a delightful place to spend some time! Comfy, warm, sweet... I just really, really liked it. 

We went here for dinner over the weekend and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. My boyfriend had the lentil soup and salad with rotisserie chicken; I ordered the salmon with market vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots). We were both very pleased with our meals.
The vegetables were fresh and flavorful and my salmon was wonderfully seasoned and cooked to near perfection. 
I'm looking forward to returning... maybe for breakfast next time!"}
{"text":"Food was great and very fresh! Had and loved the chicken salad sandwich, corn bisque soup, ceviche, and macaroons. Staff was really friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I wanted to check out the Saturday market and finally got there two weeks ago after a morning hike. We walked around the market for a bit and then went inside for breakfast. It was packed but there wasn't much of a line. We both ordered egg dishes and I got an iced coffee. Loved the coffee, I need to see what kind of beans they use.

We grabbed a seat pretty easily and I enjoyed the environment, everyone enjoying their nice Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Food was undercooked. DO NOT ORDER ANY CHICKEN! It will be served undercooked and cold. The slaw was flavorless. The service was fine but we were very displeased with the food."}
{"text":"Very good food, friendly, hip atmosphere...what downtown Phoenix could be one day."}
{"text":"I am a total food critic; do it right, make it unique, and charge a fair price and you will win me over as a repeat customer.....

Unfortunately, Phoenix Public Market Cafe fell short today when I stopped in for lunch.

I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich. Was served a single sandwich about 15 min later on a large dinner plate...no side. The roll was the highlight of the otherwise \"OK \" sandwich. $10.95 was over priced for too little, \"can get it anywhere\" food. A better sandwich with a side for less is served more quickly at many other downtown eateries.

My friend ordered salad and soup. Again a very small portion of salad at a price about 3 dollars higher than other downtown eateries.

The wait staff were fairly friendly (though I was never asked  how my sandwich was) but obviously unpolished. The salads and soup were delivered with the server's thumbs buried in the bowls - GROSS.  Also observed the cashier handling money then putting unwrapped straws into drinks without washing his hands in between. The bakery case was full or over-sized delicious cookies, but I decided to skip after observing the other food handling issues.

The place has only been open a short while and at lunchtime was fairly busy; unfortunately indoor seating was insufficient so not everyone could find seating indoors on a 98 degree day.

In short, small portions of  \"nothing special\" food at prices about 3 to 4 dollars per person too expensive and some kitchen/management execution issues (too slow and unsanitary food handling) that need resolved.

I would highly recommend you choose one of the many other downtown eateries for your lunch or brown-bag it."}
{"text":"Good coffee good music but pretty busy so service was a little slow. If you have the time to just hang out, this is a cool space. Free covered parking and a free cookie if you check in with yelp!!"}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed when I come here. I have had business meetings here and stopped in before work. The service is fast and the food is tasty."}
{"text":"Okay just want to say, the vibe is good.
The food is good. But the service was the best.
Baylie rocked it from beginning  to the end.
Will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times now and the food is always great. 4 stars because the service is always really slow. But it's an awesome little place to grab a bite after going to the farmers market on Saturdays. And they have sparkling water on tap!"}
{"text":"Delish!  We visited browsing through the open air market.  I so love this place, husband and I had the special, steak and eggs.  Steak was perfectly cooked and the poached eggs were done to perfection.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"We went to Phoenix Public Market the other night. It was pretty noisy, but ok I guess.  The hostess had her t-shirt tied up in a knot exposing her belly which was gross.  The ambiance says fast casual, the price says sit-down experience."}
{"text":"Let me start with the PIMMS CUP. They salt and pepper the rim and it's the most delicious Pimm's cup I've ever had. 

The food was good-- I had the pulled pork, served with fries and... a giant piece of fresh watermelon. Seasoning on the pulled pork was wonderful, very tender.

Service: I think maybe I just have weird looks on my face normally, but the staff is pretty hip and sometimes the service feels a little icy. Nothing bad, they're just not as warm as other waiters I've had.

Definitely coming back again, although I'm not a vegetarian they had some dishes on the menu that sounded delicious-- a good option if you want to eat out, but on the lighter side."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local spot that is luckily a block away from my apartment. 
I've come at all different hours and days and it never seems to be too crowded, not sure why, the food is great.
I've tried their chicken quesadilla which is delicious although I wish they added more quicken. 
Their pulled pork sand which is also very tasty, and is what I typically recommend my friends who want to try this place out.
Their devil fries are also pretty darn good and have a nice kick to them.
Their grandmother's cake or whatever the chocolate cake is called is mouth watering for those who ,like myself, love chocolate. It's pretty rich so I can't eat a whole slice but who doesn't like left overs!? 

Anyhow to summarize this review, check this place out, nothing on their menu has disappointed me yet and it's a cute place, who doesn't like cute things."}
{"text":"I would have gave this place four stars, but the service wasn't all that great, although the staff was friendly.

As far as the food goes, I had the Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie.  Great flavor, the meat was well prepared and was very tender, the crust was nice and crispy as well. I would highly recommend this dish!

The one thing that you must try before you walk out of that door are the MACAROONS! Our waitress suggested the salted caramel macarron, all I could say was WOW!!! 

Im sure i'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food and setting here are great. It's a very comfortable place to sit and relax. The only problem we had was that there was a ten minute wait between orders being brought to our table. I thought it was just a hiccup but noticed it happening at other tables too. They need to raise the standards of service or switch to table service where a tip (or not) will promote better service."}
{"text":"This is such a great find! The Chino Salad and Tito's Cubano are amazing! A good amount of food for the prices. The ambience on a sunny summer day was nice and relaxing. I definitely plan to go again to try more off of the menu. The person at the table next to me got the rotisserie chicken that comes with 2 sides, and I can see why it's one of the restaurant's specialties. Students get a 20% discount with a school ID and be sure to check in on Yelp to get a free cookie!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick lunch to go!  FRESH veggies, and great combinations.  I love the free sparkling water!"}
{"text":"I'm only taking a star off because the iced coffee was really, really weak. The free cookie (Ballerina flavored) was incredible and saved the day since I didn't like the coffee. The place is really cute and has so many other food options that I wish I had had the appetite to try! I would go back, but would try ordering an espresso drink instead. If I were a student in the area, I could totally see myself studying there since there's plenty of seating and parking."}
{"text":"Delish!  Been twice and happy with the food and service both times. They have really nice veggies and healthy options.  They also have vegan and gluten free if you are so inclined. First trip there, I had the coconut curry lentil soup and the market veggies. Both were tasty!   The veggies were cooked really nicely (cooked but still crunchy). Second trip there, I had the rotisserie chicken with the market vegetables and sweet potato as sides. Will definitely be back to try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Super nice wait staff, very accommodating, helpful, smiling and responsive.  Great fresh fare, something for everyone from salads, sandwiches, very accessible and twists on the usual flavors.  I had the \"Rachel\" which has a mild sauerkraut and great smooth cheese flavors and the steamed broccoli was addictive.  The lemonaid is tart without puckering the whole deal."}
{"text":"The green chili burger was insanely good. Also, happy hour specials are decent and take place for a good amount of time. The rice bowl is a little strange because the veggies come out raw. It's delicious, but I would have preferred to know about the raw veg beforehand (it should be in the menu). Service was really great here."}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast. Healthy options are a must for me and they have a great variety to choose from. Walking around the Farmers Market which is just outside the entrance is perfect on Saturdays mornings."}
{"text":"Great place to get a latte and chill."}
{"text":"Fun lunch on the way home from Phoenix Sky Harbor.   Great place for a really good sandwich and craft beer.  Loved the decor and feel of the place.  The ambience made me feel like i was back in Seattle -- without the rain, grey skies and a restaurant full of black fleece jackets.  I'm not a huge fan of ordering at a counter ... my only complaint."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great atmosphere, really good food and $5 pitchers of beer on happy hour. Awesome!"}
{"text":"We got the blue corn pancake and quiche.  The pancake was very different from your typical pancake, crispy on the edges yet super thick and fluffy.  The quiche was also good with the bell pepper sauce.  I highly recommend stopping by Saturday morning to also check out the farmers market next door as well. It was very relaxing to sit outside eating breakfast!"}
{"text":"I travel significantly, this excellent. The BBQ platter happy hour special, with salad and desert for $13 is \"best value\" bar none. Then you get a happy hour local beer poor that is a pint and pint+ pitcher!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience all around.

Great food. Fair prices. Fun atmosphere. Food trucks. Pretty people. What more could you ask for?

I prefer PMC over their other location (St. Francis on Camelback)

The chicken is excellent and the homemade \"Pop Tarts\" should not be missed."}
{"text":"Delicious food and super cute cafe! Also, the cookies were beyond delicious. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very cute atmosphere and super friendly, laid-back, helpful staff! one of my favorite breakfast spots or even just a place to grab some brain food and get some homework done. Lots of options on the menu. Cant wait to try dinner out sometime."}
{"text":"A nice place for lunch or early dinner with pleasant, if unremarkable, food."}
{"text":"Stopped for a couple of appetizers and was very disappointed. The pretzel and fries were very dry and over cooked. Would not recommend them."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite places to grab food in the downtown area.  The food is always delicious, prepared with fresh and high quality ingredients.  I particularly love the roasted cauliflower and the tri-tip.  The desserts are incredible- pastry chef, Sarah Chisholm is always inventing amazing new additions and twists on the standards.  Cookies, macarons, homemade pop tarts- dank.  The only reason I give four stars is that the service is so inconsistent.  Sometimes it takes forever to get your food.  Sometimes the order gets messed up.  While the food is reasonably priced (especially with the 20% student discount), the portions can be skimpy.  This happens more often when I get takeout for some reason."}
{"text":"my daughter treated me to dinner,this place is all kinds of trendy,fancy,kool,casual,and fun.im just unsure i was being served organic-nonGMO nourisment.i think i will investigate further,its definitely worth my time"}
{"text":"Go with a big group, order a little of everything, and use all the forks in the middle of the table. You will not be disappointed. The cuisine, ambiance, service, and farm to table specialties will have you snapping pics and and rolling your eyes in amazement with each bite."}
{"text":"From the folks that brought you St. Francis. A quick Friday lunch was on the agenda. Public Market Cafe was new and seemed interesting.

Unlike St. Francis, you ordered at the counter and the food is brought out to you. The menu is interesting, but not overwhelming big. We opted for the Del Real Sandwich and the Roosevelt Row Bagel. Both were brought out promptly and done very well. The Del Real had a subtle sweetness to it. The bagel was a two different tastes. Guacamole on one side and hummus on the other. 

The decor resembles that of St. Francis. A bit utilitarian and semi-industrial. That said, the place was comfortable. We did not check it out, but there is a bar you can sit at as well."}
{"text":"We came to Phoenix for spring training and stayed in Roosevelt Row. We ended up coming here a few times for breakfast and coffee as it was a few blocks from our condo. It's a really cool spot with a great vibe to just relax. The menu has a lot of good options for all types of people. I went with the rather non traditional oatmeal which was great. Would definitely recommend this place as a great breakfast option or just a place to get a good cup of coffee and relax. Well done!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and drinks Saturday night.  The waiter didn't even bother to check in on us after dropping off the drinks (which took forever) so we left without eating.  Place was fairly empty so there was no excuse for the poor service.  I saw a lot  workers cleaning the place but no one actually servicing the patrons."}
{"text":"Nice parking. Great food. Fast service! It was love at first sight when I saw this restaurant on a blog before my trip to Phoenix. It was near Roosevelt Row which is the art district in Phoenix and this place did the job in expressing it! To start with the positives I'll say this: the parking was great. They had a whole lot that you didn't have to pay for which I was so happy to see coming from a city that has VERY strict laws on parking. The customer service was okay- nothing special. It's a cashier counter type place so it was hard for me to start conversation except when it came to placing my order. The service was fast though which I enjoyed. The bar menu, coffee menu and lunch/dinner menu was very well put together and I really loved what I ordered (picture posted). The set up was very nice too interior and exterior! I recommend this joint if your on the run for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Always a must stop when visiting from San Diego. My mother lives in Sun City West. And we make the 40 min drive. So worth it. Our server Ryan is 5 stars all
the way! I can not say enough good thing about this guy! Try the Lee Traveno. Best cocktail I've ever had the pleasure of meeting."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch while passing through Phoenix during vacation and loved it!  I ordered the AB&J and carrot soup while my girlfriend ordered the chicken quesadilla happy hour special.  Both were great.  My almond butter and jelly sandwich was excellent and much better than the simple name suggests while the soup was rustic and tangy and a perfect compliment.  The chicken quesadilla was solid and great with the craft brews they have.  The bar had tasty cocktails as well with my girlfriend trying the gin and watermelon special.  Overall a great lunch spot and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very cool vibe, chill atmosphere, decent prices. Happy hour is a steal. Food is average, but good. Not for everyone, but we liked it."}
{"text":"What a great place!!!  Verde pot pie, black bean soup and a wonderful sweet potato with a little chili/lime/coriander thing going on.  Plus, sparkling water on tap right next to the still water spigot for no charge- nice touch!  Lovely patio, great servers and generally nice vibe.  So nice to get cool dining options downtown."}
{"text":"Always a treat going here! Food is on point, staff is always thoughtful and making suggestions to try new things, atmosphere is fun- especially on a Saturday morning with the farmers market going on outside! A definite must!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix!   Great atmosphere and staff!   Great prime rib and chicken, especially!"}
{"text":"OMG ? what better way to start the day  Prickly Pear Tea & a Breakfast Sandwich with Avocado   YUM"}
{"text":"A measly amount of rice and beans for 10 bucks. Seriously? I thought I'd get a little bit more than that. Probably cost them 2 dollars at most and I was still really hungry after I finished. I'm a very small girl so this is a hard feat to accomplish. And my friend's pot pie had so much pork fat in it he was still hungry after he finished. Really expected more."}
{"text":"Bring back the corn cookies!!! I live in Chandler and I would drive all the way downtown for these delicious cookies. For the last few times I've gone the cashiers have told me their out or that they haven't made any in a few days. This is devastating news I advertised these cookies all over my social media. Please bring them back."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. My husband and I came in on a Friday morning at 9:30 am. We had about a one minute wait to place our order at the counter. 

I ordered the Devil's Mess and my husband ordered the Suny's Breakfast Burrito. Both were excellent. The salsa that was brought out was wonderful and a great accompaniment to our meals.

We waited maybe five minutes for our food to come out. 

I would definitely come here again when back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I haven't written a review yet because I am a bonafide regular! I like the casual community style seating (although the row of tables recently added does appear to be a bit tight). The service is usually friendly and efficient. I always order the salmon (either the dinner) or the rice bowl that comes with lots of veggies, then add grilled salmon as the protein option. They also have a good assortment of baked goods. I usually get a chocolate chip cookie for dessert (very chocolatey and fresh)! On occasion, I have ordered the prime rib, which is also done well, except it lacks an au jous. I also enjoy the whole roasted cauliflower (which can be ordered as a dinner with sides).  I can't say that I love everything on the menu. There's also a nice full service bar with TVs playing sports. Parking is free and convenient (which is a big plus being downtown)."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely excellent breakfast. Food was incredible. And fantastic fresh OJ. Good service and a nice, clean, open atmosphere. Plus a great beer selection for a cafe."}
{"text":"We grabbed an early Saturday morning breakfast. The (Cartel) iced lattes were a great start and we enjoyed the chorizo biscuits and gravy with eggs. Great atmosphere. We will be back to try other options in the future."}
{"text":"The strawberry pop tart was great...but the breakfast burrito with 1/2 piece of bacon and not cooked drops this place to a 2"}
{"text":"I live nearby and have ordered take-out from this establishment about 5 times. The 5th and final time I ordered was my last because of the customer service--not because of the food. The food is good but not cheap. The reason I'm never returning is because how I was treated. 

I've worked in the hospitality industry off and on for years. (I got my start in a yuppy cafe like this one that also had 2 registers.) I walked up to one of the cashiers and told her I was picking up a take-out order. She said they had it ready but I would have to wait in line in order to pay. The line to pay was out the door. I ordered take-out because I was in a hurry. I wasn't having a lazy Saturday like everyone else. 

Every restaurant I've ever worked at had a register that dealt with take-out orders whether we offered curbside service or not. One was for in-house orders and one was for take-out orders. If we were slammed, we'd use both registers for in-house orders but one was still designated for take-out. This was to prevent phone guests from having to wait or walking out. 

When I saw the line at PPMC, I knew it would be about a 15-20 min wait because of how slow they operate. I walked out. I never got my order and I never paid for it. I'm sure I'm on their sh** list, but they're on mine, too."}
{"text":"Today at 7:15 am my wife and I visited the Phoenix Public Market Cafe for breakfast.  Your establishment was full of holiday cheer in all the correct ways,  impeccable service, seriously clean environment...friendly smiles from your staff abounded!  My wife ordered the Quiche that was a little dated (however the above mentioned matrix overrode this concern) and I throughly enjoyed the Rooster Booster! A serious compliment to your staff as both our orders were served to us by two of your friendly staff at precisely the same time! We barely had enough appetite remaining but what the heck we also shared your fresh and hot Cinnamon Roll to our delight.  GREAT JOB ALL THE WAY AROUND...we will be back!!!

The Phantom Diner"}
{"text":"How can something so simple taste so good? Im not sure although I had text mom and tell her that Egg and potato tacos were just what I needed. The staff is super friendly and patient. Barista told me to take a refill to go. Did I mention that they have a self service water bar with both Sparkling and Regular water. Who does that? Normally Sparkling come with a heft price tag, Not here. Great working space and delicious food with great coffee."}
{"text":"This place is our new favorite spot. On Saturdays after perusing the Phoenix farmer's market in the parking lot next door, we come here for brunch. This place used to be a little market & cafe but they really did a great job reconstructing it. The patio area has sleek, long wooden benches and tables along with a fireplace and a bar area. And, it's dog-friendly!

I have dined here a few times and haven't been disappointed. I've tried the pesto frittata, beans & rice bowl, the open-faced veggie melt and the vegetarian Del Real sandwich (my favorite veggie sandwich everrrr). My boyfriend LOVES their Flanched Flarney Garney sandwich filled with bacon, eggs and avocado. Their bread is fantastic and you can take home a loaf, too. 

They have a fantastic happy hour that we've been meaning to take advantage of. It's every day from 3-close and their five rotating draft selections look great. Oh, and their coffee is divine.

Great food, generous portions, lovely ambiance, perfect patio and a friendly staff. We're hooked."}
{"text":"I really, really, really WANT to love you Phoenix Public Market. I keep coming back again and again expecting a small miracle. With your delicious beer on tap, yummy pretzels, glorious pastries, overpriced rotisserie chicken and amazing patio you should conceivably be my main squeeze.

... but I can never figure out where or who exactly to order from. The entire staff seems to be totally DGAF ASU kids on their iPhones telepathically screaming \"NOT IT!\" as I approach them. Why have five cashiers if nobody can take an order? It's absolutely confounding. Do I need to know a secret handshake or password for better service? I'm already spending $30 on lunch, shouldn't that warrant even a brief acknowledgment?"}
{"text":"I'm a local and we keep coming back to this place time after time. Consistent, wholesome food and friendly service keeps us coming back. Oh, side note, they sell Bundaburg ginger beer which keeps my ex-pat partner very happy."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to the Phoenix public market cafe last night 6/10 and we had a blast!

This place had good energy, everyone enjoying each other's company. Her and I sat up at the bar top and had a custom order of nachos with a local seasonal brew. 

We walked here, but there is plenty of parking. The staff here are very approachable and friendly. I look forward to coming here again and trying other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Everything here is just ok. Nothing bad, but nothing outstanding either. The staff seem disinterested, not that they're slow or offer bad service, just that they don't really care whether you are there or not. I went on a Friday morning and the parking lot was full. After street parking I went in and asked why the gravel lot is not opened for overflow parking. The girl at the counter taking orders said it is only open on weekends. I mentioned it might be nice when it's busy to open it. She just stared at me."}
{"text":"Place is great to look at and part of a creative revival of several older downtown Phoenix buildings turned eateries/bars. 

Crowd was a mixed type but leaned towards upwardly mobile hipsters? Some decent craft beers on tap, some wine offered as well. Really great cocktails.

Menu is fairly vast and diverse, I settled on the pretzels (delish with creamy cheese sauce) and the fried chicken (not so great). 

Servers and helpers were beyond friendly yet completely disorganized this night, but I was in a good mood and opted not to make their lives miserable. Plus they acknowledged every error and forgetful act and we received a majority of the meal for nothing. Big props for that. 

Overall I'll be back. Love the environment and cool folks, but the jury is still out on the food overall for me."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a road trip due to its convenient location off the highway. Very chill atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating. Fast and easy counter service. Cool bar area with unique cocktails. Super tasty fries, highly recommend. Would definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"I've only ever eaten here after walking around the public market on Saturday mornings so that being said it is always packed but always worth it. $5 bloodys and mimosas seems worth mentioning and their chicken salad sandwich is so bomb that I can't imagine any chic salad without curry now. You'll also definitely want to treat yourself to a dessert. Yum!"}
{"text":"I have lived in PHX my entire life and i had never heard of this up until a few weeks ago. It had a very good vibe while there and I enjoyed all of the fresh food."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here this morning with my boyfriend, and the place was hoppin' -- a nice sight to see downtown, somewhere other than Matt's. Was a little confused as to where to order at first, but a man near the front (a manager possibly?) directed us to the back to order. From there we found a seat at the bar, as all the tables were occupied.

Decor is really gorgeous -- I feel like the space maintains elements from the old market and cafe, but it still has its own look. Very clean lines, lots of wood, and roomy. 

On to the food. I ordered the frittata without onions, and a side of potatoes, while the boyfriend ordered a bagel. The frittata was huge -- it was the size of a flat dinner plate -- but light and fluffy. The pesto was really lovely and gave the eggs a well-needed flavor. My biggest complaint is that the frittata and its accompanying bread was pretty heavily doused in olive oil. With the eggs it was a pleasant taste, but the bread was so greasy I couldn't bear to finish it. The side of potatoes, however, were so bomb. Salted on the skin, and soft and fluffy on the inside, they were cooked like all potatoes should be. 

Boyfriend liked his bagel, and the bite I had was pretty tasty. The bread had a nice crunch and wasn't too dense. 

I've been looking for a restaurant downtown to frequent more regularly since the one food item I love at Carly's gets a little redundant to eat, and I would love for this restaurant to fill that void. Here's to hoping that they get the olive oil issues under control, and until then I'll be back for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Love coming here, beautiful cafè with a pretty awesome staff. Unfortunately tho, today I sat at the bar after getting off work. (I work right around the corner) I wasn't greeted by my bartender. I could see he was a little stresses making drinks,  however the restaurant wasn't busy and he seemed overly backed up. After awhile I call out to the bartender just to get his attention he tells me to hold on (with an annoyed tone) finally I tell him I'm in a bit of a rush can I place my order and he just looks at me and says \"well?\" So I order. And he just throws some waters in front of us. Placing my order was the only time I made eye contact and communicated with my bartender the whole time he never asked how the food was or even of we wanted anything besides water he was rude and unprofessional. Not a very personable staff member he was. I'll be back for more drinks but that bartender needs an attitude adjustment."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of my favorite cozy little cafes back home in Minneapolis. So in love!! Words cannot express how much I enjoyed my experience here. #1 though is that cold brew!! A good strong cold brew coffee will win me over every time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, natural food, beer and wine specials, and homemade baked goods.  Love the eat the rainbow salad and nutter butter."}
{"text":"Had never heard of chickpea pancakes until I ventured into this lovely restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised at the deliciousness of the pancakes! My fiancé and I sat in the bar area and were attended to right away. It was a busy Saturday morning, but the service was great and the food came out quickly. I love that the farmers market is just right outside their doors, so we can walk around a bit after all the tasty food! Great food with friendly service."}
{"text":"What's not to love about local organic community sustainable fresh everything wrapped into one downtown chill vibe spot?! Yup ... Now if they would just get those BikeForce delivery service guys to deliver to my place in downtown my life would be complete!!!! :) You guys rock #dtphx in every way. Welcome to the cool hood!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in this morning for some breakfast, and I have to say that Aaron and his team have truly outdone themselves!

I used to shop here when it was the little grocery store, and the way they redid the space is SEXY!  I just love all the space and brightness, the brick walls and the wood elements.  

I got a tour of the kitchen, which is huge!  The rotisserie (while I don't eat the birds) is sweet, and it gives the cafe a really delicious smell. You have the option of going up to the counter and ordering or they have a full service coffee bar. They also serve up beers and wine on tap for the full \"bar\" experience.  Breakfast is served from 7am-3pm and lunch/dinner is served from 11am-10pm.  For brekkie, I had the Chickpea Pancakes!!! They were very good, topped with roasted pecans, bananas and agave.  I paired that with a nice cup of Cartel coffee and chowed the eff down.  

In addition to the food and drinks, they also have a little section of wares in the middle of the cafe.  I saw some great stuff (books, soaps, wine bottles turned into drinking glasses, bow ties, etc.)

I like how they have incorporated little bits of St. Francis to their menu, including: the baguettes, the rice bowl and the Del Real sandwich.  The menu has lots of rustic/farm-to-table/fresh items on there, and I can't wait to come back all of the time!!  They just opened recently, but I would HIGHLY recommend getting your backsides down as soon as possible, because they are sure to blow up soon."}
{"text":"Oh, this was bad. My order came out 25 minutes after everyone else's, with no apology or explanation. I got the same thing as one of my coworkers (the quinoa bowl with poached eggs) and it was flavorless. The partially-cooked broccoli in the dish was especially pathetic. Coworkers weren't terribly happy with their food either. Their orders ranged from quesadillas to burgers and sandwiches. 

I'm so disappointed because I'd heard great things about this place, but I was totally let down. The 20% discount with ASU ID was nice but it's not enticing enough to make me want to go back. The food would have had to be halfway decent. 

One star for the immaculate bathroom."}
{"text":"GET THE CARROT CAKE. The frosting has a little bit of pepper in it and it's delicious!

I haven't ordered a true meal here yet but I love the atmosphere whenever I come in. Everything looks and smells delicious, and it's a warm and friendly environment."}
{"text":"So good! I had the biscuits and Chorizo gravy-- so tasty and very filling. I took some home for leftovers. Service was quick and nice even though they were extremely busy (I went on a Saturday)."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken that isn't greasy!"}
{"text":"The absolute best curry, lentil soup I have ever had!!. Great fro Vegans! Full bar parking"}
{"text":"Always friendly staff!  Very helpful and they don't rush you when you order.  The menu is diverse and always full of fresh ingredients.
They are a great place to stop at during the week and are on the light rail, so you can park at a Park N Ride and get on/off and use the light rail."}
{"text":"My husband and love to come to Phoenix Public Market whenever we are in town. The easy going, relaxed vibe and delicious, healthy, locally sourced food is super refreshing. Great place for breakfast - but just found out they are open well into the evening. Everything from espresso to mixed drinks to quench your thirst."}
{"text":"A very friendly and helpful staff behind the counter the 3 nights I ordered carry out. Farm to table vibe with comfort food in the mix.  Loved trying a new Kombucha they had from Sedona.  Rotisserie chicken with sweet potatoes was the favorite entree I tried. Thanks to the staff for recommending the cilantro lime butter on the side. It was tasty but a little goes a long way.  Tried the apple tart and 2 of the cookies in my visits.  Thumbs up on the sugar cookie...reminded me of a great sugar butter cookie when I was little.   Chocolate chip cookie was just ok. Could have used a little salt to balance the sweet.The pastry crust on the apple tart was lovely and the apple and cinnamon center rocked too."}
{"text":"Edit: forgot one thing. My mom's sandwich was more bread than anything else. Found out later that the guy making drinks at the bar was bringing everyone else their drinks (to their table) but made my mom come and pick hers up from the bar. Now I'm not sure why but being that she is the only Asian lady in the entire restaurant am I not allowed to think this was why? I won't judge because I can't know every side but this is how it looked. -1 more star (from three to two). Sad since the food was so good :( 

Came up on this place during my visit here in Phoenix. Let's start with the bad, and get to the good (which thankfully for them outweighs the bad) 

Cons: since it was my first time here I was lost and confused about pretty much everything. Cashier was no help, and didn't answer us (just stared blankly) when we asked questions. Or maybe she didn't hear us because the music is way too loud. I ordered a prickly pear iced tea and she rung it up. It never came out from the bar so I went up to ask, and it turns out that it's self serve. Would have liked to know that sooner. Then soon after I couldn't find it because (shocking) it's not labeled prickly pear-- it's labeled HERBAL. Why? I don't know. Would have liked to know that too but it took me a few rounds of questions to get that out of the worker at the register. I was already irked so I just got myself regular iced tea and sat down. 



Okay now for the pros: 
Absolutely adorable decor  as soon as I walked in I was in love. The food was amazing, I had the AZ Burger and I loved it. The bun was soft and not dry. The patty was juicy and cooked to perfection. The green chile in the burger was a delicious addition. House dressing added a nice zing. Pretty plating is also a plus. Everyone in my party loved their food as well.

If you want to come here and haven't been before, be prepared to go in blind and without assistance from employees because they probably can't hear you. Otherwise, it's a great cafe with absolutely amazing food. 
if I come back again I'll probably have a better time because it'll be more familiar ?"}
{"text":"I loved this place!!! Awesome vibes with friendly staff. We got coffee drinks and pastries- both were delicious. The peanut butter cookie was unreal and so was the chocolate chip. They have cheap pitchers of beer and a great happy hour. The crowd was unique and a variety of ages. They also sold t shirts and other souvenirs. A great place to study or meet friends!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went there for first time. Cool place and we are at the bar. The guy there was very cool and funny. Gave us recommendations and cool to talk too. Would love to come down here when cooler. Want to check out the farmers market on Saturdays too

Food was fresh and service was quick. Will come back again."}
{"text":"great location, easy parking.
variety of menu items is very good.  If available, try the pork pot pie.
a little noisy when crowded - lunch hour during the college school year.
staff is very friendly and helpful.  Service is quick.
baked goods are great, especially the bagels.
of late the roast chicken is getting a little too \"smokey\" tasting but I will try it again."}
{"text":"This is what happens when you find a new place to try.  Nice restaurant and atmosphere is great.  Had the rooster booster, good stuff. My eggs were scrambled and fluffy.  So good.   My other half wanted his eggs over medium and they ran all over his plate.  He loved the scrambled much better. Will return."}
{"text":"I used to shop at the market before the renovation to a restaurant. I'm not a fan of the new place, I liked being able to buy local veggies and cheeses. We stopped in for breakfast bc Matt's was packed. I ordered a The Rooster Booster and the Chick Pea pancakes w/strawberry jam for the baby. The baby didn't like her food, instead she ate my eggs. The pancakes tasted better with jam instead of syrup. I love eating healthy but that doesn't mean food cant have a good flavor.  I gave the Market 3 star's bc the coffee was good."}
{"text":"Love the decor, bartenders, deserts, cocktails & happy hour prices. I can't wait to try me some chickpea pancakes. I love pancakes (I'm not a veggie head ok)! 
Just do yourself a favor & haul your cookies down here to this place & you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Really cool place!  Sorta feels like Urban Outfitters with food!  My boyfriend and I gave this place a try last Saturday for lunch after running errands downtown.  I ordered the roasted pork sandwich that's only served on Fridays and Saturdays.  My significant other ordered a scrambled egg dish.  Both were delish, but we liked my sandwich a little more.  Next time I'll be sure to tell the guy behind the counter to go a little lighter on the lemon aioli.  

The lemon aioli is a hit - BUT a little too much can take away from the flavors in the pork.  The cashier let us taste a piece of the pork before we ordered.  We loved it!  Once I got the sandwich, the pork flavor wasn't as potent because of the lemon aioli.  Overall, we totally enjoyed the experience and food and will definitely return!

oh .. grab a iced latte with a shot of vanilla... heaven seeping through a straw I tell ya :)"}
{"text":"Always love to go to Phoenix public market. Usually make a day out of it with the farmers market very close. I'm also a big fan of anything that Aaron Chamberlain has going on in the restaurant business. I usually go for breakfast but I love their assortment of treats."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic local, downtown watering hole and exactly what we needed.

It's a rustic space that still retains much of the market grocery charm but with phenomenal touches from Aaron, Lee, and team.  The patio is not too crowded and seated nicely, perfect for dinner or drinks with friends.  The flow is also fantastic as you can either head directly to the bar or browse the market on your way to the counter to order.  

We had a limited menu tonight for opening night.  That being said, we both enjoyed our meals thoroughly.  The AZ burger (& fries) was delicious and the chino salad was good and refreshing (though I'm not a noodles in my salad person, but I wanted a salad).  Both with a farmer's cup in hand (pimms drink - yum!) and I was giddy as a schoolchild over the self serve water station with sparkling and still options.  I want to go back right now for the sparkling water on tap alone!

We each also had a smores cookie for dessert.  It captures the graham crackeriness of a smores and chocolate chunks and chewy texture without marshmallows.  It was an interesting (and delicious) interpretation.  I was also eyeing the snickerdoodles.  I'll be back for those.

We were sent away with a couple corn cookies to try (at Aaron's insistence).  THe husband is currently a fan (description: sugar cookie, but like cornbread, but not; it's really good), I'm skeptical of most things with corn.

We'll certainly be back and are excited to see the rest of the menu and make this our local hangout. :)"}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere but the noise level was not good at all.  The food was not that good either and it took 1 3/4 hours from the time we were seated until we paid our bill.  The service is really bad.  It took 20 minutes to get a glass of water.  Our waiter kept forgetting that we were even there.  He would walk by with water but it was evidently for another table that arrived after us.  We did not receive our food for an hour.  Not a place I will go back to.  They may have good happy hour prices on drinks but its not for me.  They need a new kitchen staff and at least one new waiter.  I ordered the pot pie that was very crisp and even burnt on one side.  I don't see why all the good reviews unless people like spending their time in this place without getting much service.  The only thing good was the atmosphere (other than the noise level) and the hostess."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place while walking around downtown Phoenix on New Year's Day and I'm so glad I did. The decor is cute and the food was delicious: my friend got the Tito's Cubano sandwich and I got the three-course meal with the BBQ Platter entree. My whole meal was enough food to make me feel at least three months pregnant, except a lot more fun than I imagine pregnancy would be."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is very nice, but a restaurant can't just survive on this alone.  When we arrived we were waiting in a line that was not moving.  Then an employee politely told us we could go to the bar and place our order.  My sister and cousin ordered a cup of soup with a salad and pretzel and a grilled cheese.  I placed my order separate for a pork chili verde pot pie.  My sisters soup arrived in a huge bowl.  She explained she ordered a cup.  The server told her it was the cup.  The server asked if we needed anything else my sister explained she ordered a salad and pretzel.  The server went to check on the items and came back and said the person who rang up our order must not have included the salad and pretzel as they were not on your receipt.  My sister explained no problem, she didn't think she could eat them anyway because the soup was so big.  A few minutes later a different person brings the pretzels to our table.  We all looked confused to say the least.  This server said they had already put the order in.  How could they put the order in if she was not charged?   We thought at this point they were just giving us the pretzel because it was already made.  The pretzel was OK but the sauce given to dip it in was awful and had not taste.  It just tasted like flour and water.  To our surprise another server  had charged my sisters credit card on a separate transaction without getting the card from her to do so, then hand carried the receipt to our table for her to sign it.  Very suspicious behavior for a business.   Now lets discuss the pork pot pie.  It was pricy and came out small, overcooked, and literally was dryer than a cotton ball.  There was no gravy inside.  On the way out, I waited in the front area to talk to a manager but the same gentleman working behind the bar did not have the situational awareness to see I was waiting.  I eventually just left.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Cool concept and cool scene. Fresh tasty veggie-forward menu. Fun place to lunch it up."}
{"text":"Really cosy and innovative place. Lentil curry coconut soup was amazing..worth a visit."}
{"text":"I only came for drinks, but WOW did they do a GREAT job with this place! The decor is very urban and updated, but not pretentious at all! I had a melon mojito that was awesome, and a red sangria that was very good as well. The service was on point, prices right and location perfect! Next time, I'll check out the food on the menu."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. Our server was attentive and professional, the energy of the cafe was hip and fun. Food choices for gluten free, vegan and vegetarian were well marked and delicious. We will be back next time we are on the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Cool decor and ambience. Food was fresh and moderately priced. Service was quick and friendly. Ordered the nachos and added chicken. The carrot cake was a little dry probably from being in the refrigerated case."}
{"text":"The beans, rice, and guac bowl was filling and yummy, although overpriced. Be aware that they write the menu with chalk and the dietary labels are incomplete. For example, my bowl was just salsa brown rice and black beans, but was no labeled gluten free on the menu- though the manager confirmed to me it was gluten free. When pressed further it was because the cooks thought brown rice had gluten. 

But overall, really yummy! Loved it."}
{"text":"As far as first impression goes, this spot is right on!

This place is very pleasing on the eyes. I just love how open this place feels. Since I saw the pictures of the Devil Fries, I knew I had to get it so there was no question there, but what else to eat? I ended up choosing the chorizo biscuits and gravy and a side of carrot cake to top it off and I think I did good. 

Devil fries - yummy! Love the sauces it comes with. Even though its 10 dollars, I totally recommend getting it, worth the monies.

Chorizo biscuits and gravy with over easy eggs - Love the twist on this, like how theres a spice to it, but with any biscuits and gravy, I can never finish the whole thing because I get bored after a while, so make sure you have someone to share it with because the portion is pretty generous. 

Carrot cake - Hm the flavor of this is very good BUT it was a little on the dry side. I can see potential if it was a little less dry. 



Definitely coming back here to try their coffees and other goodies they have to offer. Cant wait!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  My girlfriend introduced me and I'm hooked. My only complaint is the smallish portions, but the food is spectacular!"}
{"text":"Very rude bar tender. Had to wait 10 minutes for drinks. She forgot she never gave them to us and that we already paid and gave the worst attitude. We left after 1 drink because it was that bad. It was the first and worst drink of the night."}
{"text":"I love this place! Macarons are delicious and customer service is always nice, cheerful, and warm. Great place to stop for breakfast before hitting the farmer's market."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast but stayed for a few cocktails as well - the farmer's cup is highly recommended! 

Nice atmosphere, delicious food, easy to find parking (covered too!), & a very attentive staff. Frittata is great for folks on a diet (read: I could have used a few more bites) while the flanched flarney garney is quite hardy (too good to stop, but  you should anyway). 

No free refills on the coffee but otherwise a great breakfast/cocktail hour. Will go back, hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"Just stopped here for a late breakfast and we were not disappointed. The restaurant is small but cute and has neat little rustic stump tables in the back. We had a fantastic breakfast burrito and the farmers quiche with arugula salad. Everything was fresh, well cooked and delicious! Hubby and I were very pleasantly surprised. This is our first experience with Arizona food and it was a great one !"}
{"text":"Great find!  They have both breakfast and lunch - and an indoor outdoor bar/patio.  Comfortable vibe and the people are great."}
{"text":"Delicious pork chili Verde pot pie! I might come back tomorrow just to have my husband taste this! They have sparkling water on tap too, which is fun"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab coffee and some amazing, fresh pastries in the morning. The staff was super nice and the pop tart was out of this world. The best part about this place is that you can walk around before or after and check out all the local goods for sale in the public market outside. Make sure you stop in, I recommend coming early."}
{"text":"My #1 favorite restaurant!! I can't even count the number of times I've been here. Late night hangs, quick lunches, weekend breakfasts & everything in between! It's such a great representation of downtown! Not only is the food outstanding, they have the best homemade macaroons around! Their menu is health-focused & their mission is community. I've never had a disappointing meal or mediocre service. All the staff are so cool you'll feel like they're longtime friends. Any chance I get to come here, I'm here. & in case I haven't said enough, they have an Open Air Market every Saturday morning. Come check it out & support local farmers & small businesses. I love you, Phoenix Public Market!"}
{"text":"No ESPN despite the DirectTV dish. No World Cup. Told owner. Hoping they add ESPN. Great food and drink though. Lovely patio."}
{"text":"First timer this weekend. Easy parking, not too crowded. Very quaint and bright space. I ordered The Devil's Mess...scrambled eggs, spinach, onions, fresh jalapeño, served with a fantastic tortilla and salsa. It comes with chorizo but I opted for bacon instead. Try the prickly pear iced tea! :)"}
{"text":"Okay so I have to admit I was originally extremely unimpressed. My brother brought home the chopped salad as well as the caesar and some pancakes over the weekend and they were alright but I expected more. 

The cucumber and pickled onion side salad is delicious but messy people beware! This is a messy persons worst night mare and upon ordering you are asking to just ruin a piece of your clothing.. Still worth it though! 

Anyways I got in to the cafe today with Cole and we shared the del real sandwich with a cinnamon role. The sandwich will definitely be my go to from here on out. No complaints on the cinnamon role either. They heat the pre made pastry up and top it with cream cheese frosting, yum! 

Definitely go in soon and redeem your free cookie but tip: stay away from double chocolate and stick to the vegan peanut banana !"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! This was our first stop after coming to Arizona and it was fresh and delicious! Good place to come for food, coffee, and drinks! Service was super friendly and they were quick to clean tables for us to sit down."}
{"text":"OK - to preface everything - I sincerely like the food at this place. I like the space itself, indoors and out, and want to support local restaurants, farmers, artisans, etc. For the most part, I am docking this place down for terrible service and a terrible service model for food that isn't cheap.

The fact of the matter is that this place operates on a Pei-Wei type service model. Order at the front, tip (for service you don't receive) and your food is brought out to you and you are never talked to again. Fill your own water. Wait, you want another drink, well go get it yourself from the bar.

However, what seems to be the service exception is the bar. Which is why I like to sit at the bar. You're supposed to have service because you are paying after you eat.

But - you see, I have been here probably 5 times in the past 4 weeks. Out of those times, I would say 4 of them I or my friends have had to flag down the bartender or the server (not sure if they are really supposed to be servers, because they don't ask how your food is, or provide much service other than delivering the food) in the restaurant for an item. And  I mean chase a bartender/server down to get a drink when there is no one at the bar. The seats at the bar weren't always filled, and bartenders aren't stressed with orders, just dawdling and not paying attention to customers at all. Cleaning the espresso machine, making lemon twists, making orange juice, not paying any attention to what is going on with their customers. Each time I have been seated at a bar, the bartender has never proactively ever asked me what I would like to drink, nor have they asked if I would like a refill. 

Same goes for the restaurant - seated at a table - our food took 25-30 mins to come out, (fries 5 mins after the burger) and after it came out, the server was nowhere to be found. (But again, are they really servers? Are they supposed to provide service?) All we needed was some extra silverware and some extra ketchup. (Fries only come with one little cup of ketchup) Once we saw her, I ordered a new drink - and that took another 15-20 minutes to come out, at which time, I was close to finished with my food.

Overall, when the food comes out, it is good. However, the burger is $10 and doesn't include fries ($3 and ask for them extra crispy)... and remember... no service. So I am conflicted - if I want a good burger and no service, I might as well go to Five Guys (cheaper and better) or it's this place's sister restaurant St. Francis, where I can pay about the same price for burger and fries and have a server.

Finally, the local wares. Yes! I want to support local - I'm not sure who is doing the pricing on these items. A cotton grocery bag with a screen print of the logo - $14? That is nuts! I can get one at Fresh and Easy for $.99. Again, I get the local thing. But appropriate pricing is also relevant. A 2.2 lb bag of flour for $9? I would pay around $5 - because it's local, but $9? When the pricing is so drastically different than what you can get at the grocery store ($2.49 for 5 lbs of flour) it does a disservice to local producers as the price is so disproportionate its somewhat unaffordable to buy local. (And 2.2 lbs of flour isn't going to last long.) 

I would definitely encourage you to try this out (and the market next door). It's definitely worth a look. Just don't expect any service."}
{"text":"Fell in love with the cafe as soon as we stepped in. Frittata and Evans-Churchill dishes were delicious and definitely recommended. What's better is that the staff was so friendly and accommodating overall with our toddlers that it made a great start to our day:) Had my first well made cappuccino in Phoenix as well !!"}
{"text":"The baked goods are amazing! I haven't been very impressed with their vegetarian options though. Generally the ambiance is nice though and the food comes out quickly, so I'll continue stopping in every few months."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! I dig that their menu is unique and they own it! It was just full of things that I would not think to combine, yet they taste and worked well together. 

I tried the Chick Pea Pancakes: chick pea, olive oil pancakes topped with bananas and pecans served w/agave syrup (very very sweet but tasty!) The pancakes definitely needed the agave syrup as they would have been dry without it but the flavor of the total pancake package was delicious! 

Cookie with Yelp check-in was awesome, I got the nutter-butter type cookie (i am not sure if that was the actual name.) It was a recommendation, I typically don't go for peanut butter type cookies but this one is a winner!

I also tasted the \"Devil's Mess\" which was eggs, spinach, chorizo, chiles and onions...for those of us that are pansies when it comes to spice you may want to stay away from this item, it was pretty spicy per my taste buds. 

Cool market cafe scene, interesting people watching and great food. I like this place, and am definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"Gotta give 5 stars cause the place is great, aside from some staff here n' there. A blonde barista complained to me once that she had to walk around the bar to bring me a drink. Seriously? There's 8 customers in the place, they were super slow on a weekday and she's bitching at me (a paying customer) about having to use her legs to walk around the bar to do her job."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The people.  The atmosphere.  Are just awesome.  Same as the great delicious plates they serve.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Quite a few people I know have been to Phoenix Public Market so we decided to go in to grab some snacks / an early dinner. I didn't realize they have happy hour everyday which was nice to see since it's not very common! It had quite a few menu items as well as drinks on it. I'm not certain if we didn't order quite the right things or what, but we left disappointed with what we got.

Our order consisted of devil fries, a pulled pork sandwich, and pretzels to share. The food came out fairly quickly but unfortunately only the pretzels came out piping hot. The cheese fondue that came with the pretzels was on the lukewarm side as were the fries which made them incredible soggy. The pulled pork sandwich was at a decent temperature but it was pretty dry. I wish it had more of the sauce or something on it. In addition to the fondue being lukewarm, it was also weirdly gritty. I think if it were warmer, it probably would've helped the consistency. The fries were also overly salty, and the dipping sauces they were served with tasted weird. One was plain ketchup, that obviously tasted fine, and one other sauce which was a bit spicy was okay. There was one however that tasted weirdly smokey. I'm not sure exactly what was in it but we decided to just leave it alone.

The service also wasn't that great. It's not a sit-down place, just order at the counter and they deliver the food to you, but I saw employees who worked there asking others if they were doing okay, needed anything, etc. We didn't need anything so it was fine. A-ok on the food. I'm not sure we'd be inclined to recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Community Night is the way to go here! 3 course dinner for $12.99? Can't beat that! The service is spot on. The food is oh so good! My friend recommended this place and as soon as everyone took their first bite and put their forks down, we were already raving about it...and asking if we could come back again tomorrow. If you were sitting at a nearby table and you heard us, you'd think we hadn't had a meal in weeks. It's that good!!

5 stars - Roasted Cauliflower with mashed potatoes and arugula salad. This roasted cauliflower is the best preparation I've had of this dish. Perfectly seasoned and roasted with the exact doneness you want. It's got the smoky crisp edges and it's cooked tender throughout. Cut a piece of it and dip it in some of the chili aioli that comes with it! The mashed potatoes was the thicker creamy type and well seasoned. The arugula salad was a light addition to round out the entree. 

5 stars - Soft serve ice cream. This one is sourced locally. Love that! This is the dessert part of the 3 courses, and you get a choice of vanilla or chocolate. Or you can get one of their jarred desserts. They were so nice and let me try the chocolate and vanilla. This soft serve had a nice natural taste to it with a pleasing finish on the palate. The chocolate wasn't too sweet and had bits of dark chocolate in it. The vanilla though. My favorite for sure! Perfect sweetness. 

5 stars - Color changing spoons. That's right. I'm writing about this. Get the ice cream and you get a pink spoon with it. But then after eating your first spoonful of ice cream you notice the pink spoon is now purple. How cool is that? The cold temperature changes the spoon to a different color! Our table really got a kick out of this. Ah yes, the sound of friends laughing together. What a sweet sound. This is such a creative touch that I really appreciate. It just sealed the deal for me!

This is so my kinda restaurant. If I lived nearby I'd eat here every week, where the ambience is cool, the servers treat you like friends, and the food is flavorful and high quality! Hmmm...what should I order tomorrow when I come back?"}
{"text":"I have now been here twice and can proudly say their breakfast is DELICIOUS.

When my fiance and I came for lunch, we really didn't enjoy our food too much, but the service here blew us away.  

The guy who took our order literally told me not to order The Rachel.  I thought it sounded good.  I should have listened to him.

My fiance had a small issue with her Rice Bowl order, and when she told someone, they immediately brought out an extra side, and gave us a $5 coupon to return.
 
They also have a nice patio.

ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Had the lumber jack burger (13.99) thinking it would be a master piece.

Very disappointing!!

Burned back, no taste, the bread was cut too thick 

The 3.00 fries are good but not 3.00 good!"}
{"text":"Been here three times and have really come to enjoy it. Very cool design, food has never been a disappointment, and the beer list is good and features some locals. When the weather is right, the outdoor patio is very enjoyable and gives a bit of seclusion from downtown. 

The only thing I wouldn't mind seeing improved is the service, or at least getting a better understanding of the service setup. Unless you're sitting at the bar, it's order at the register and they bring it to you. If you're at the bar, you get a bit more service. Not a huge deal, and it makes sense now that I've been a few times, but I could see it being confusing. 

I'm glad to see this space seeming to do well and look forward to being back. Besides, the video of the plants growing is really interesting and a fun way to reconnect with nature in an urban environment."}
{"text":"The good:  Nice atmosphere, delicious food, fresh ingredients and lovely dessert.
The bad: slow service and our waiter was a bit absent-minded, but nice enough."}
{"text":"Discovered this place touring downtown Phoenix with Taste it Tours.  It was Phenomenal! We had the pulled pork sandwich and all 15 of us agreed it was Fantastic! I am excited to have discovered this place and will be back again and again! I don't think that there is anything on the menu that will disappoint. They have it all....... a bakery, barista, bar and great food!"}
{"text":"Great food as usual. BUT as I was finishing a guy came in and sat next to me and he STANK!!!!!!!!  I know this isn't the Cafes problem but DAMN."}
{"text":"I met up with two of my besties today for brekkie and had, quite frankly, low expectations based on some things I'd heard.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised on a variety of levels.  First of all, my old buddy Mike was manning the coffee bar and made me a kick-ass cup of cold pressed coffee with agave syrup in it.  It was delish!  I had some reservations about the menu but we all found something yummy that pleased the palate.  I had the granola, creme fraiche, and fruit...my only quibble there was too much tasteless watermelon and not enough berries along with way too little granola, especially for the price.  It was enjoyable overall...not quite a \"destination\" joint based on the menu but it has good wait staff and a cool vibe inside.  

So, how to get another couple of stars?

1.  offer specials and/or \"locals-only\" deals.
2.  offer more items on the menu for breakfast
3.  put the lemon aioli on the menu for the potatoes

Fancy food combinations aside, value and taste will keep folks coming in regularly."}
{"text":"Oh em gee. This place is bomb. We came here on a whim, but so glad we did. First, they have lit, covers parking. Second, the food was the bomb. My wife said it best; \"It's simple, done right.\"

By the way, if they have the trifle, just skip dinner and get as many as you can. Trust me!"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time when I lived in Phoenix! I love that they are always changing their macaron flavors. Today I sampled their mango chili macaron, and it's as interesting as it sounds. Definitely recommend for happy hour!"}
{"text":"If you've lived here for any amount of time, you know how much Downtown Phoenix has improved over the past few decades and one of the best improvements has been the addition of the Phoenix Public Market and the adjoining café. The market is a great place to buy fresh vegetables, meat, and other items, and the Café is a great place to have meals made from those same healthy ingredients. I had a giant salad, and my kids had sandwiches. The food was excellent, but what I really liked was the atmosphere. This does not feel like Phoenix! it feels like you are in Los Angeles, San Francisco, or somewhere else cool and different. It's like taking a vacation without leaving the city."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants made a huge misstep and switched to counter only service. What the heck. The server staff was the best in town and you could graze and add more to your order at will. 

Food is still top notch but sadly not a place to come multiple times a week with my peeps any longer. 

I won't be going back in protest."}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day and had the best experience! Great food, great service and friendly people. Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. Everything is locally grown and very flavorful. It's a little pricey for lunch but the portions are large and the food is good. I go about once every two weeks with my friends for lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing in every way!! That burger is too damn insane and too damn delicious. I swear I inhaled it in 2 seconds. The jalapeño burger. Get it! Great staff too and awesome atmosphere"}
{"text":"Id be happy to eat here every day for three meals a day. The variety of food they have is incredible and I was SO impressed with the speed at which you get your food. This is a must visit if you're in town- there is something for everyone here. 

I was so happy with the Asian bowl. It was heaping with veggies and I added chicken which upped the price but kept me full for most of the day. I am already dreaming of when I can come back!"}
{"text":"Good food. A surprisingly diverse menu. I had the home made pop tarts from the bakery and I was impressed.  The side car was very well prepared.  Good restaurant overall"}
{"text":"Very cool place! Came around 11 and the place was packed! They have a full service bar and a good array of food choices from breakfast lunch to dinner! There is adjacent parking for customers but the lot was full when I got there so paid for parking across the street.  Loved the vast array of options I just grabbed some cold brew coffee (cartel) and a bagel, which I was told they make in house! Both were good but kind of pricey as it was $8 for the two! Defiantly take advantage of the free cookie with the check in- i had the ballerina!"}
{"text":"We ended up here after we failed at eating at Matts Big Breakfast. Thank goodness! As I walked up to the door, there are bicycles parked out front and vegetables growing beneath the windows. My kind of place!

This is a \"walk up and order\" joint which usually gives me anxiety as I feel rushed into a decision. There was a \"calm\" about the room that made me feel at ease. The kids got pastries which were heavenly!!! I wish I would have gotten one. The egg dish I hair (frittata) was ok but nothing special. 

The service here is AMAZING. We were checked in on several times and in a very genuine and non-obstructive way. 

Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  went to an opem mic they jave every tuesday night.  Gabby was the best,  really nice and helpfull!  Definitly gonna be back."}
{"text":"I used their catering menu for my son's party and the food turned out great, plus they gave extra utensils just in case. They showed up exactly on time at the venue and they took special requests such as cutting bagels into quarters. I definitely recommend using their catering in the future."}
{"text":"A trendy place with fresh local cuisine. I love this place. The food is very good. The staff of the service is always friendly. I recommend."}
{"text":"Best salads with only the freshest veggies! Their pulled pork sandwich is killer. I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is AMAZING. Coffee is AMAZING. Atmosphere is super fun! Highly recommend the farmer's market they have here as well."}
{"text":"Phoenix Public Market: where Fresh, Local Conversation and food meet. While I have only been here a small handful of times, I can see this quickly becoming my go-to hangout AND chow down venue. 

First, let me note that the atmosphere alone for those of us who like casual, urban settings - you will find great solice in this wonderful downtown gem. I sit here with my Iced Chai, and my Devils Mess (A fantastic mess of eggs, farm veg, local made chorizo, and a crunchy slab of home made 9 grain) and my trusty laptop, I have NEVER felt more relaxed in a Downtown cafe. While it is a very nice, hip feeling place chanalling what I'd like to call a slice of Portland in Phoenix, I do not feel the posh annoying stares of Hipsters, and Buisness men. I feel like I belong here, which I think is what they are going for. There is a lovely mix of community seating, and tables - the outdoor seating if truly beautiful - although I have yet to sit out there. Phoenix Public Market Cafe' has combined Urban, Industrial, and Classic Downtown Charm all into one place - AND I AM HOOKED. 

I find myself invested in the sucess of this place. I really do hope downtown is good for them, I feel they will thrive in this location - being a very short half a block walk from ASU downtown campus. 

Now to get to the part we all love - THE FOOD. Again as stated previous, I got a Iced Chai and The Devils Mess. The Chai was some of the best I have ever had, and I do consider myself a bit of a Chai snob - It's the only drink I ever buy from a coffee shop or restaurant. This was creamy, but not to sweet and did quench your thirst. PERFECT CHAI BLISS.  The Eggs were really something special, fluffy, but the cilantro and hot peppers added the perfect complement.  The 9 grain was fresh, you could tell it had been made this morning, and was crunchy from grilling on the flat-top. All around some of the BEST breakfast I've had in Downtown Phoenix. 

I WILL BE BACK VERY VERY SOON!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and great atmosphere. Definitely something I love! Food was ok, but service made up for it! They even had sparkling water on tap how cool is that! Will be coming back because Arizona needs more great spots like this one!"}
{"text":"This place never lets me down!  Love their food the and the honey butter is better than Claime Jumper's!!!"}
{"text":"I have spent many mornings, afternoons and evenings here. I have had their breakfast burrito to their Tres Levino cocktail at night and have never been disappointed. I am embarassed to admit that sometimes, while working nightshift, I dream about going and getting their breakfast burrito once I'm off work. Gooey melty cheese and bacon- simple but delicious! Their green chili burger and downtown fries also hit the spot when I'm feeling naughty. Great patio and outside bar to hang out at casually."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 4 times now and the food has always been tasty.  I love the pancakes and there is a great veggie sandwich, it's huge so it can be shared otherwise be prepared for leftovers.  I love that they have sparkling water, my favorite.  It's a little noisy at times and an espresso is 4 bucks but other than that a good place for a tasty meal."}
{"text":"Went here Christmas Eve with some family. Two of us had the Cuban sandwich with ham and pork and it was delicious. I like that they shaved off the top of the baguette so the meat to bread ratio is consistent. Our group also got a Caesar salad with chicken. It looked really good because it had rotisserie chicken on it, not that usual disgusting cold grilled chicken that is usually on such a salad. Also had a margarita type cocktail - friendly and quick service at the bar, drink was good mix of flavors, but was a little sweet and light on the liquor for my taste. We also got some rolls for Xmas day and they were amazing. I like that they have the food counter separate from the Bar so boozers like me don't have to wait with the food line before getting a drink. Tip: get your drink first! Then stand in the food line."}
{"text":"First time here and greeted by some amazing looking cinnamon rolls! Got the Devils mess omg yum everything was amazing and the staff was great. So so glad we decided to come!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. Vibrant atmosphere well staffed with a very friendly crew. I had the chile verde pot pie. The filling was quite good and had a little heat. The crust was a bit chewy. My husband had a burger that was outstanding. The beverage selection, both soft drinks, beer and wine was nice. The cookies were amazing. I especially loved the apricot cookie. Definitely a place to go back to."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I was not in a great mood when I was dining here.  I was traveling with my mom and she could not make a decision on where to eat so we ended up walking for an hour and stopping by like 2-3 other restaurants (love her but not her best moment).  So I found this spot and we walked the additional quarter mile here.  The staff and service were fantastic- super friendly and helpful.  
The menu looked great- mostly healthy and fresh options, which is sometimes a challenge to find when traveling a lot (NOLA- I'm looking at you with 1-2 salads on the menu, and buttery, delicious, sauteed veggies).  Anyway- I make some pretty bomb salads at home (for an eighth of the price), so it's not typically on my list of things to order when I'm out, but they sounded great.  I saw some yelpers mention the pulled pork, so I tried that and my mom got the Cubano.  The sandwich was huge and the bun was little too much, so I ended up just eating the pork, which was good, but definitely not the best pulled pork I've had.  The sauce was a little too sweet for my taste and pork seemed like it was not homemade/ in house... It didn't have that fresh, smoky, taste/smell to it, almost like it was a crockpot pulled pork recipe, and it was really pretty average to me.  The Cubano on the other hand was really good.  I loved the free cookie for checking in (a sugar cookie with corn- unexpected, but nice texture surprise).

Again, the staff and service was fantastic, but the food just missed the mark for me."}
{"text":"They have some amazing pastries here. Right now they have the most amazing strawberry pop tart. It is definitely worth getting. It's not overly sweet which was the best part. Hats off to the chef!"}
{"text":"This place was so good that we went twice within a couple of days. The nachos, superfood salad, and coconut curry soup were great for lunch. We returned for breakfast, where I had the quinoa salad and my other half had the blue corn pancake. We sat outside to enjoy the weather and spent quite a long time here without feeling rushed. Also, it's a major plus for me that they have sparkling water on tap."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast with my boyfriend. He did not like his orange juice because he's never had fresh squeezed and thought it was too pulpy and not sweet enough but I thought it was great. He did, however love the super crispy bacon and his giant bagel with cream cheese. I had toast with cranberry jam, very different and delicious, and the fried new potatoes may be the best potatoes ever. Unbelievable. The.giant cookie I got free was delicious too."}
{"text":"We came straight from the airport in need of serious clean and nutritious food for our journey to The red rocks. This was it! The meal was great....we are going to swing by on our way back to airport. This was the perfect welcome and farewell."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. It had a very nicely decorated interior and the menu sounded good. However, the food and service did not live up to my expectations. We ordered the pretzels and jalapeño cheese sauce for an appetizer (my fave thing) and the pretzels came out luke warm and the cheese sauce was so bland. You could not even taste the jalapeño. Also, our server did not inform us of their happy hour specials, which we would have taken advantage of. My boyfriend ordered the AZ burger which claims to have cheese and a spicy aioli. The beef was so juicy but you could not taste any of the toppings. It literally just tasted like beef. At least it was good quality beef. My Mediterranean salad can be described as \"meh\". Overall, boring food seriously lacking in flavor. Our server also largely ignored us. We probably won't be back, especially since it was overpriced. A shame."}
{"text":"This place is cool and has a hipstery vibe. The staff is always very friendly. The place is always crowded when I come here. They have a healthier menu that is a little pricier, but not too bad. The food is good, but not to die for. They have a coffee bar area and an area to order food. I would still recommend this place to other people."}
{"text":"Delicious curried chicken sandwich and their chicken quesadilla is phenomenal! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Seriously OBSESSED with this place! So glad I ventured over to this gem instead of the typical restaurants on campus. I looove the ambiance. Food takes slightly longer to come out but being fresh and local I think it is worth it. The carrot ginger soup is amazing. They have great macaroons, grilled cheese, fresh cut fries, it's all wonderful!"}
{"text":"Can't believe that I haven't been here for lunch until today.  Love everything about it.  Great food! Loved the Super Food salad with rotisserie chicken.  Yumm! The BBQ pulled pork sandwich my husband had was amazing too! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The worst muffin I have ever ordered and the priciest also. Charging $3.79 for a freakin stale, dry, no taste muffin is basically robbery. How is it possible that there is no quality control tasting this baking disaster? Amy probably can do better than this joke of a \"Seasonal\" muffin. The seasonal was blackberry, but there was maybe one blackberry total present. I broke it in half to share and the thing fell apart after 1 bite leaving a mess and with just crumbs I couldn't really return the thing. Seriously, if you read this and still get a muffin. your an idiot."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good.. But when you have to fight with the flies to protect your food, the quality goes out the window."}
{"text":"Sorry, but since you have taken away the corn cookies, I have to deduct one star, the food is still very good, but no corn cookies...no 5 stars...bring back the corn cookies"}
{"text":"This is such a cool restaurant.  When you walk in you can immediately smell the smoky goodness.  The decor is fabulous.  I love the open beams and rusty muffin tin wall art.  There is a full coffee bar and regular bar.  The service was amazing.  The gentleman that served us, made a connection with me immediately.  He saw my yelp check-in for a free cookie.  You can even get a macaroon!  He patiently waited while my boys chose their cookies and decided which bottled soda they would share.  He talked about his nephew that he and his partner love to spoil.  I would come back just for his amazing service.  My youngest son ordered the chickpea pancakes and they were my favorite.  My hubs and oldest ordered burgers and fries, they were delicious.  I ordered the quinoa and poached egg breakfast with roasted veggies.  It was really delicious, the eggs were perfectly poached!  It has such a funky vibe I will definitely make the trek from Gilbert to visit this little oasis in the city again soon.  You won't regret the experience!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here. Awesome food, great atmosphere, and service is A+. For me, the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the beer selection, it's not the best. They do a great job of keeping the choices local, just a small selection."}
{"text":"Upon walking in, I really wanted to like this place.  It's got that local hipster vibe that is cool without bordering on pretentious.  But I must admit, it didn't really do anything for me.  One of the main reasons we decided to go there was because my husband wanted the pot pie... and they were out.  :(  

I got the Del Real sandwich and it was tasty enough, but nothing special.  I got a free cookie for checking in on Yelp which was cool but my \"homemade\" Oreo was on the odd side.  

Given the foodie landscape that is quickly developing in Phoenix, I probably won't come back here as there are so many places I love and so many places I have yet to experience."}
{"text":"Sarah, our waitress, was AMAZING! I only want to sit in her section. The macarons are delicious, the devil fries were magic and the pretzel, heavenly. Beautiful. I got the Lee Treveno drink is refreshing. Music on point. Do it and go!"}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner at Phoenix Public Market Cafe last night.  The food was phenomal, as always, and the atmosphere was very urban and chic.  We ordered several items off the menu and shared amongst ourselves.  The burger and the Del Real sandwich tied for tops on our list, followed closely by the open-faced peanut butter sandwich and the salmon with black beans.  To top it off, they have several pastry items and signature drinks to help wash it all down.  The combination of the bar, patio, bakery, dining area and farmers market will keep Phoenix Public Market Cafe busy for a very long time.  Aaron Chamberlin and company hit a home run with St. Francis, but they knocked it out of the stadium with Phoenix Public Market Cafe!!!

I look forward to many more meals and frosty beverages at this wonderful establishment."}
{"text":"I found this place just \"Yelping\" through the area near my office. The reviews were good so I gave it a shot. Totally worth it! The atmosphere was comfortable and simple. Great mix of people and the food was good to boot! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. One time was takeout and once eat in, brunch on a Sunday. 

The layout is terrible. It is extremely difficult for anyone to move around, and there is not enough seating for the number of patrons. With the way the line wraps around the restaurant, it goes between one line of bar seating and one line of tabletop seating. Essentially 3 rows of people extremely close to each other, while other people (including staff) are attempting to walk through. This results in people backing into each other or pushing each other since there is no room to move. 

The posted menus are impossible to read from any distance, so be sure to grab a menu and have someone to hold your spot if you want to look at the specials. 

While the food I have had each time has been mediocre, my biggest gripe is that I got horrible food poisoning the last time I ate there. I ordered a breakfast burrito, and the tortilla was raw in some places, and the bacon was not fully cooked. I got sick immediately after consuming it, and had the worst food poisoning of my life for 2 days after that. I was so sick and in so much pain that I was unable to sleep for over 48 hours after the meal. I would have considered coming here again aside from the food poisoning, but I will never return and I will be sure to warn anyone I know."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast - liked it so much we went back for dinner. Great vibe, great food. They have a really nice kids menu as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorite downtown cafes in Phoenix. Fresh farm to table delights are on the menu satisfying the palate of adults & children."}
{"text":"We went in on a Friday afternoon and the establishment was fairly busy. The interior of the restaurant is quite unique and comfortable. We decided to sit outside and we were pleased we did. The service was good, the staff was friendly, and the food was very good.. There is an array of choices! This restaurant is anything but dull.! It was a fun afternoon. We were definitely pleased."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Phoenix Public Market Cafe last night and everything was wonderful.  It looked pretty busy when we walked up and I was worried there was going to be a long wait, but to my surprise they were able to seat us right away.  Our waiter was very attentive and friendly.  I had the chicken salad sandwich with fries and he had a pasta dish.  For dessert, we shared one of the pop tart pastries.  The pop tart was so good! I can hardly wait to go back.  We're going to try their breakfast this weekend.  I wish I had discovered this place sooner! The only con was paying $6 for parking.  There was a farmers market going on in the lot next to the cafe - this may have been their parking lot."}
{"text":"I went with a few co-workers for happy hour last week. This was my second time at the Cafe and I was excited to check out the happy hour specials. We arrived around 5:00pm and were seated outside promptly. However, it took almost 20 minutes for a waiter to come to our table, and this was after waiving our hands several times trying to get a waiter's attention.

The happy hour specials are pretty good - $5 drafts, cocktails, and wine. I stuck with Orange Blossom to go with my pulled pork sandwich. The sandwich was good, although a bit small for the hefty price (almost $10 with no sides). During our three hours at the Cafe, we constantly had to flag down our waiter when we needed drink refills.

I love the food, drink selection, and atmosphere of the Cafe. Its location is perfect. But the service leaves much to be desired, and the food menu could use a few more options. But overall, this is one of my favorite hangout spots in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Amazing menu for vegans and vegetarians!!  Very friendly, cozy outdoor seating and clean. Food was fresh and delicious. Tasty options include the frittata, Chinese salad, black bean soup,  and guacamole.  French fries were amazing too. Can't speak highly enough. Recommend visiting often."}
{"text":"Love the food, the service - everything EXCEPT the noise. The restaurant has absolutely nothing soft to absorb the sound and so every conversation there becomes part of a cacophony of noise. Shame, because it really is good food and excellent service. But don'tgo expecting to be able to talk to your companion/s. It's really too noisy for  that."}
{"text":"This is a really interesting place to get a quick bite or something sweet to eat.  I love that it's a local business and right next to the Phoenix Public Market.  In terms of quality of food, things here are great.  The menu is simple, but done well and local ingredients and artisans are showcased here.  The only two downsides I have experienced in my several visits, are the inconsistencies when it comes to their coffee bar - the drinks I've had just weren't very good, and when you go at night when seating is required, it feels really disorganized.  All in all, I would recommend that you give this place a try - I feel like they could work out those little kinks and be a really great local place to enjoy some great meals and interesting cocktails.  Try the Farmer's Cup and the Chicken Salad Sandwich. Both are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I have a lot of lunch meetings/dates here. The food is always delicious and staff very pleasant. LOVE that they have sparkling water on tap (though it must of been out my last time there?) My only gripe is I can't get lunch items until Lunch time. I know, I know...but I always seem to come in 15 mins before the lunch switch when I need to grab something to go for lunch and end up ordering a breakfast burrito (which is Good) or a salad in the to-go section."}
{"text":"Love this place! We will be back! Staff super friendly, hip place with fabulous food! Kind of loins and a little pricy but well worth it!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The kale salad is hands down my favorite thing here! Freshest of fresh of just everything. The staff is always very nice and it's just a really relaxed, cool place to go. Love the market on Saturdays too!"}
{"text":"A friend and I came here for lunch during the week and I loved the laid back yet on spot service we received. I love that you order from the counter and then seat yourself. The ambience of the building is very open, urban, hip, and raw with the exposed ceiling beams. I loved the neighborhood, community feeling mixed in with the urban, raw look of the materials used. 

I had a pot pie that was amazing!!! It was hearty, filling, and totally hit the spot. I love having a meal that is filling and hearty but doesn't leave me feeling so full that I feel like I'm walking around with a brick in my stomach. 

The side of Garlic Mashed Potatoes I had were equally amazing as the pot pie. I loved that the potatoes were made fresh, and not overly buttered and salted. 

I came here the other morning for coffee before heading over to the amazing Phoenix Public Market on Saturday's and was not only very happy with my coffee that I had, but I must say one of the gentlemen working the bar was very easy on the eyes. Just saying!!! Love getting great service, from great looking people too!"}
{"text":"Tried it a couple of nights ago. Love the concept and the ambiance, so expectations were sky-high walking in. However, the service and the cuisine were just OK... I can see this being a very cool hangout. Keep it at that and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't think I give 5 stars often but on the items we ordered, they deserve 5 stars.

Ordered the salmon which was pan seared crispy on one side, and rare plus on the inside.  It was seriously one of those unique times when a restaurant just cooked a piece of salmon perfectly.

We also had the green chile pork pot pie.  Crust was good, crispy and doughy and very comforting.  The green chile sauce was very flavorful and tasty as well.

I had their house chardonnay which was pretty affordable.

It's a coffee house/hipster vibe so it's casual and also a place you can eat and just hang out as well.

They have a great drink selection (including craft cocktails), I didn't try the cocktails but they all looked good.  Also a full selection of coffee as well.

Convenient to the downtown area and a great alternative to some of the more expensive and probably not good restaurants in downtown.

Also got a free cookie for yelp check-in!  Peanut butter was great but so is the smore cookie!"}
{"text":"The only good thing I had to eat here were the pretzels because who doesn't like bread with salt. The cheese sauce that came with them though was disappointing. I got a salad and it had no flavor and was coated in oil. On top of all that the bill was outrageous for such bad food. The location is cool but that's all they have going for them."}
{"text":"First time here. I have to say I was most impressed with the service and friendliness. Everyone was very welcoming and smiling. It's a casual, all-inviting atmosphere. There's lots of locals and travelers due to the proximity of downtown. Our waiter was Niko and he was fabulous. Knew the menu well and was super friendly...another smiling face obviously enjoying his job. Thank you!

The food was great. We started with the house pretzel and downtown double fries. The house pretzel cheese is very original...we really liked their spin of it. I had the rotisserie chicken and was quite impressed. Very juicy. My partner had the southwestern pasta and was raving about it. 

Then we had a cookie spread...we basically tried them all. Nothing short of amazing. I can't really pick my favorite. Peanut butter and peanut butter buttercream frosting, sugar cookie with sprinkles, 3 different macaroons, a white chocolate oatmeal cookie, chocolate chip cookie and a corn cookie with frosting (it had a kick!). Best. Peanut. Butter. Cookie. Ever. 

Pricing was very reasonable. I was expecting a higher bill. I look forward to recommending this new find to friends and family. Unique cafe. I look forward to making a special trip just to try the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"I came with my family for my first time. I ordered the Chorizo and eggs, forget what it was called... it was delicious!! I just gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the portions weren't very big for the price. Mine was 10.00 for 2 eggs  a little chorizo mixed with onion, a small tortilla and salsa, but it was very tasty! Everyone loved what they got!"}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite place to eat in Phoenix. The food is local, health-conscious and delicious. The portions are perfect - filling but not overwhelming. As far as customer service goes, unparalleled, truly, the servers are extremely cheerful as well as knowledgeable about the surrounding area. There's something magical about this establishment that can only be encompassed in one word: community. The Public Market Cafe makes it a priority to nourish not only your appetite but also your soul. I consider this eclectic eatery a shining beacon of culinary opportunity in a city that is only beginning to recognize its enormous cultural potential. Hats off to the owner, chef, and management team. I'll be coming back for years. 5 STARS!"}
{"text":"Fun and relaxing place. Really liked the casual lay back atmosphere and what's not to like about a place that serves breakfast at 2pm!  Good food and friendly service. Recommended."}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming to the Market Cafe.  The staff is always really friendly and I love how they have happy hour every day from 3-close.  HH includes $5 pitchers of beer and $5 cocktails.  

Last night was the first time I had dinner at the Cafe.  Normally when I come it is either for HH or for breakfast.  Well I had the Rachel sandwich that had coleslaw, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, house dressing, melted on sourdough. WOW, that sandwich was amazing.  I'm glad I finally had dinner here.  I definitely be coming back to try something different.  Also my favorite cocktail drink is the Lee Trevino and my favorite breakfast item is The Rooster Booster.  

If you have not been to the Phoenix Public Market Café you are totally missing out.  So, when you are in the downtown area and wanting something to eat or drink.  You should totally come here."}
{"text":"I'd highly recommend coming here if you're staying nearby. Their menu is extensive and I loved the free cookie if you show them your Yelp check-in. I got a Mediterranean salad and added chicken. The portions were huge.

Service was amazing. Our server was attentive and I never had to look for him. 

Great ambiance."}
{"text":"Super cute, great atmosphere and interior brick makes me happy. Definitely recommend checking out the market and grabbing a pastry or coffee from here. Great vibes."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant over the weekend and were SO impressed!  For starters, they have plenty of parking available including a private lot.  The dining area is spacious with a bar top and open patio area.  It was a pretty busy weekend and only offers counter service (no wait staff), but the line went quickly and our food came out within a couple of minutes.  We ordered two teas, two entrees, and a side for about $30.  The food was very tasty and their menu has a great variety of both breakfast and lunch items.  So glad we found this spot and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Are here yesterday with my mom. OMG SO GOOD!! The atmosphere is lovely and the food is fantastic! So fresh and so light! Definitely will be back!! Maybe even today!!"}
{"text":"We had stopped by to grab a bite after catching an afternoon game at Chase Field following a Giants victory.  There are certain aspects of farm to table cooking at the Phx PMC that I appreciate.  This place was always busy when I've walked by to visit the vendors at the open air Public Market.  

Sydney who took my order at the counter was extremely helpful and recommended the biscuits and chorizo gravy or the Chile Verde pot pie.  I went with the biscuits and chorizo gravy which was a hit.  Obviously not your  traditional dairy based gravy with milk and flour but I loved it and the bits of local Shreiner's chorizo gave it that kick!  

The veggie frittata was pretty pedestrian but with that drizzle of pesto on top...now that was a nice touch!  I liked that a lot.  

It's not on their menu but they serve fried chicken sourced locally part of their 3 course dinner and I would come back to try that!  Building community through food and a great spot in downtown Phoenix!  A solid 4 stars for the great service and a really good first meal that started off my weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Just found this gem.  Best burger I've ever had.  Best cookie...yep, must go back and check out the rest of their menu.  YUMMY!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice.  I'm a visual person so I always scope out the look of a restaurant upon entering.  I love the warm and natural industrial vibe of Phoenix Public Market.  I was told it used to be an old garage, and that's evident by the large windows.  There's also a community table for meeting new friends or gathering with large groups of your old friends.  I felt right at home.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The chips and guacamole came with a red and a green salsa. It was all good but I wish the portions of the dips were a bit more generous.  Speaking of generous I had a grain bowl with beets and arugula with a refreshing champagne vinaigrette.  The salad was light and filling all at the same time.  The portion was large enough to take half of it with me to enjoy the next day.  And, enjoy I did.  I look forward to my next trip to Phoenix to visit the Public Market Cafe."}
{"text":"The Lee Trevino cocktail is yummy!  The veggies and garlic mashed potatoes are to LIVE FOR!"}
{"text":"Hip place.  A lot of wood accents. Very open.  Downtown. Decent menu. After seating it did take a while to get a water and some attention. Staff was friendly. Nice place for groups or maybe casual meeting. Overall decent place. Highlight
Of the visit! MACAROONS!!  salted caramel was delicious and will surely return STRICTLY for more macaroons."}
{"text":"Q: What could be better than a savory pulled pork sammie and a tart grapefruit IPA for breakfast???? A: A savory pulled pork sammie, a tart grapefruit IPA for breakfast with a homemade, buttery strawberry poptart on the side!

Yelp users, I apologize for the lack of photo evidence of this meal. I was afraid of my hangry boyfriend swiping the last bite of poptart if I stopped to document the beauty of this experience."}
{"text":"Good food, drinks and service. Management also cares about keeping top notch customer service standards in place."}
{"text":"Terrible. I got a yelp account just to review this place. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, and it had a clear plastic bag mix in it, the size of my hand. My co-workers and I were disgusted. They didn't seem to care and just brought out another one with a $5 gift card (thanks but that doesn't even cover half the cost of the sandwich I just ordered). It gets worse, the second sandwich had a huge chicken cartilage piece in it, I officially lost my appetite. I would not recommend eating here, if fact I will probably go out of my way to tell people to avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"I ordered Chino salad to go.  Everything was delicious.  At first, the chicken on the top of the salad looked very plain, but it was cooked perfectly and the whole combination of salad, chicken and dressing was harmonious.  Their menu is small but they go for a quality for sure.  The restaurant is very open and has big window.  I loved their community like large tables and benches.  The menu is perfect for brunch and lunch."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! I had the breakfast egg dish that was topped with pesto and a dirty chai. 

Tip for the owner: it would be great to have some large reusable coffee cups for those of us that sit down for breakfast or coffee. I ordered and paid for a large latte to stay and when I went to the barista to pick it up, I asked her to be sure to put it in a large reusable cup and they didn't have one. So instead I had to get 2 small ones. 
There seem to be some great practices in terms of green sustainability (like the water fountain and reusable utensils!) so this would be a great next step."}
{"text":"Ordered avocado toast, it was really good. I loved it. My family ordered eggs toast and bacon, that sucked and was overpriced. Also orange juice and turmeric is not good. Overalls, i like this place but I cant give you 5 stars when you don't know if your getting quality or shit."}
{"text":"What a great find- healthy, fresh and full of flavor..  The latte- impressed!
Thanks to my friend for talking me into staying... and the farmers market is right next door"}
{"text":"One of my favorite neighborhood spots.  Great atmosphere, kind staff, and really good food & drink."}
{"text":"O...M...G!!! the strawberry brown sugar cake is just... (orgasmic) wait, heavenly... no, scrumptious... no, DELIGHTfully delicious!! Went recently to get a side of something to accompany my packed lunch, and every time I've popped in, I have eyed the strawberry cake like a sugar addict going through rehab, oh wait like a sugar addict? No, I still am a sugar fiend but I digress, anywho I have eye-balled this confection numerous times but I have chosen other treats like the pop tart, the chocolate chip cookie, the lemon bar BUT no I didn't resist I chose cake, and this cake has brought me joy, I feel revitalized ready to take on my afternoon, ready to accomplish, err, no but I would like another piece. Oh, and in addition to the strawberry cake, I had a cup of pumpkin soup, delicious but that's another story, my dear it's all about the cake!"}
{"text":"First timer there. Went for breakfast, it has much to be desired. House coffee had grounds in it, nothing very good in taste. Breakfast was over priced, two eggs two pieces of bacon and a small slice of bread, over $8. Granted it's downtown and it should cost that much. I wanted it too be better. 

Side note; the morning our party went they were preparing chicken in wood burning stove, our entire group left smelling of a campfire. Some like it, some don't."}
{"text":"Always good food.  Fun because it is close the The Nash - a great Jazz venue in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I am a new fan of this place - really close to my apartment, and I love how it is adjacent to the farmer's market so you can be a part of the \"scene\" down there. I was sad to see the Public Market Grocery store go, but this restaurant has done an excellent job of keeping the integrity of the building intact. I may even like this remodel better than the old one. The exposed wood ceiling is beautiful. The patio is gorgeous. And the reclaimed wood tables and low-slung benches in the dining area make you want to sit down and stay awhile. There are free water spigots for regular and sparkling water, a nice touch,

However, I feel the food still has work to do. I was not very impressed with my egg sandwich at breakfast. I specifically asked if there was anything aside from guacamole, cheese, bacon and egg on the sandwich. The cashier replied \"No, nothing else\". Well, I get the sandwich and the guacamole has onions in it. I hate onions. Onions are my nemesis. So, I have to awkwardly and messily scrape all the guacamole off my sandwich and put it back together. Also, the cheese was not melted onto the sandwich. It was just cold, grated cheese atop the egg. I found that a bit odd.

If they can iron out the kinks with the food, which I have heard that they are trying to do (including adding new items to menu soon), then I think this place could be 5 stars."}
{"text":"I was downtown for a few meetings and thought I would grab a quick bit in between meetings. My first stop was closed on Mondays so I thought I would try something new. Walking in it was a very relaxed atmosphere, you walk up to the counter to order. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, and a white chocolate macaroon. 
The sandwich was AMAZING! I enjoyed every bit and even got a little dad as I got to the last bit. It was really creamy, with mustard in the mix, which I personally love. The mix of textures was pleasant. 
When I ordered the amazing young man, (I didn't catch his name) told me to give my macaroon a minute to adjust to room temperature for a better crack and flavor, I am so glad I listened! 
I am absolutely pleased with my experience and would recommend it to anyone. The fact that I paid up front to start made getting in and out in time for my meeting extremely easy! I will absolutely come back."}
{"text":"First time visit last weekend, I liked the atmosphere that the decor created. Seated inside but still had a feeling of being outside in a market. Was there for HH and had cocktail from HH menu. I don't recall the name but it had a nice hint of jalapeño. Pretzel with dipping cheese was delectable. Fun place for after work HH."}
{"text":"This is a great place to kick back and relax with friends or by yourself, in the downtown area. The food and drinks are good, as are the prices. In addition to the main dining and bar area, there is a nice patio for (semi-)al fresco dining or imbibing, The staff provides efficient and friendly service and - for me a big plus in the summer - there's covered parking, except during the times when the farmer's market takes up the covered parking spaces."}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here on Wednesday nights because they also have the farmers market next to the restaurant and some food trucks. It's not a huge one on Wednesday but it is decent. We've eaten here a number of times and it's always phenomenonal.

 Tonight I got 1/2 the rotisserie chicken with veggies and baked sweet potatoes. My fiancé got the lumberjack burger. We also ordered the pretzel bread appetizer but they ran out (our waitress apologized and said that a handful are made for the day) we got the chips and salsa. My fiancé got the prickly pear tea and I got the sangria. The prickly pear tea was great, it isn't sweeten but they have splenda. The sangria had apples in it, it wasn't the best I've had but wasn't bad. The chips were freshly made, I should know,  I got greedy and threw one in my mouth and burnt my tongue haha! My chicken was moist and flavorful. You know sometimes when you get chicken and it isn't well seasoned and taste bland? That's not what you get here. Everything was fresh. I had a bit of the burger which they cooked perfectly, cheese was still melty when they brought it out. The ambience was very nice. Relaxed, easy, good food, lots of laugher.  They also do community seating, which if you're down to make new friends, is great. I come back time and time again never disappointed. ( I usually come twice a month on Wednesdays)"}
{"text":"I have to admit a dirty little secret: I would get a glass of on-tap Cabernet Sauvignon at Phoenix Public Market before walking over to my Nutrition Class at ASU. It's one of the only red wines in AZ that I don't have to sneak an ice cube into; it's already chilled! 

I've eaten here plenty of times and would give a 5/5 time and time again. From their glittery macarons (literally glittery - gold and silver speckled!) to their kale salad, it is fantastic. Their mimosas, cocktails, coffee, and bottled beverage options could please any crowd. It's a great place for a date, homework, business meeting, or grabbing a quick bite on the go. 

One of my favorite aspects of the market is the farmers market and food truck Fridays that they host. It promotes an eat local atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Phx for breakfast, lunch and dinner. All of their food is fresh and I've never had a meal here I didn't enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for any time of day in downtown Phoenix! I love that you can get food at the bar and grab a few pitchers during happy hour for $5! The food was great and was at a great price! The bartender actually stopped and talked with his customers and our server checked back frequently and was friendly as well. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious food with a unique menu. Great for breakfast, brunch or lunch. Really nice, trendy atmosphere with a outdoor seating, heaters and a fire pit. It also has the best latte I've ever had in Phoenix, and as an Australian, that's a big deal!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite with friends in a really casual setting

The chicken curry sandwich was good. The bread was the right thickness and did not overwhelm the sandwich filling. The curry was a sweet curry and danced across my palate

BBQ pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw was pretty good.  The combination of the coleslaw and meat was nice. A suggestion would be to add a little more sauce. 

The venue was comfortable, but loud. Great parking"}
{"text":"I really love the space. It's all about the ambiance. I'd come here just to sit and look at people. Like a real weirdo, I'd stare directly into your eyes as you bite into a juicy burger, making you feel self conscious for no reason. 

Kidding, I'd be too busy biting into my own delicious piece of rotisserie chicken. Speaking of chicken, that wood roasting method is perfection. It kind of ruins the ol' Sprouts chicken that sits under warming lights waiting patiently for me on lazy nights. Way to ruin a perfectly good relationship built on convenience, PHX Public Market. 

Now let us have a little discussion about vegetables. Do steamed veggies make anyone else angry? Like, what is this crap? Seriously, this isn't the 1950s. Nothing is more sad than a boring-ass steamed vegetable. I'd rather just eat it raw. It's even worse when someone tosses it in some kind of fat. So let me get this straight, you are going to cook that broccoli in the healthiest manner possible and then you're going to cover it in fat that doesn't actually make it taste better? I just don't get this method of preparation and I never will. There are plenty of healthy and infinitely more delicious ways to serve a vegetable. Why does this abomination still exist? When is it not disappointing to see this side dish on your plate? Be honest. Have you ever been excited for a steamed vegetable? (If the answer is yes, you are either my grandma or so white bread it hurts.) I wanna put out a PSA on all the other healthy alternatives to steaming a veg. Seriously, it doesn't have to be this sad. 

Aside from the lack of inventive vegetable sides, it was a lovely night."}
{"text":"I tried this cafe out for the first time this month and was pleased by the visit.  The food was delicious!  They had a special for the AZ Burger (green chile, lettuce, cheese, and a dressing topping) and a beer for only $8, so I jumped on that.  I guess this deal is for each night that the D-backs have a home game...  I then ordered a side of fries to round out the meal and sat down to wait for the food to be delivered.

The food came out relatively quickly and was delicious.  The seating area inside was a bit small, as they had maybe 8 or so tables on the side of the room.  As a result, it was a little loud while we were eating our meal.  That said, the food was still delicious.  I definitely recommend the $8 D'backs deal.

As a first-time visitor to the cafe, it was a little challenging to figure everything out.  You order at the counter, but the counter doesn't initially stand out (depending on the entrance door you use).  Ordering & delivering food seemed to be a little bit of a challenge with the cafe employees, but we eventually got everything sorted out.  Overall, the food was good and worth a visit, but some of the logistics around the restaurant could definitely benefit from being tuned."}
{"text":"I do not ever care to have the piped music/noise this loud. Not only does it make it nigh upon impossible for conversation, but it can be disorienting for those with hearing dysfunctions, not to mention oppressive for some PTSD survivors. Finally, a persistent pounding base can be unconducive to proper digestion. One star down for noise.

That said, the (non-noise) ambiance is terrific, as is the food. I eat here often enough and tried numerous items off the menu, to say the food is great.

It has a lovely patio and the 'bar' is indoor/outdoor (*pet and kid friendly).

A very big draw is the Sat morn farmers market adjacent to the restaurant.

I think the prices are $1-2 higher than the average 'family' restaurant, but remember it is about the ingredients."}
{"text":"I had a lunch meeting here and was so impressed by how fresh their food is! I ordered the Kale Salad w/chicken and oh my goodness, it was delish! It probably could have had a little bit more chicken but hey, i'll take what I can get! I loved the beets (that is what sold me) and the citrus dressing. I also want to come back and try the Farmer's Market Salad (I hear that it has lots of yummy dips for the veggies and being a sauce freak, that sounds heavenly!). I love the overall vibe of this place and will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Tried the piaya made in the Saturday Farmers Market, it was simple but good. The restaurant itself is pretty loud, crowded and over-rated."}
{"text":"I was heading home from the airport and battling traffic when I decided to make a quick detour to this nearby cafe.  Great decision on my part.  It had the wifi connection I needed to get some urgent emails out, a decent $5.00 glass of wine and tasty nachos!
Enjoyed the service, atmosphere, and seating as well.  Looking forward to my return already."}
{"text":"Great food
Only one problem
I don't like is that they put the silverware in a tin in the center of the tables. People cough, and talk over it which makes it not sanitary."}
{"text":"My husband ordered a burger and fries with a mudshark  draft.  I ordered chicken with sweet potato and grilled veggies.   The best part of the meal was our free cookie by checking in with Yelp.  We even purchased another to go.  First the good, veggies were grilled perfectly and very fresh.  The chili lime butter on the sweet potato was tasty.  Now the rest, the burger was dry and taste less.  Maybe a little onion and tomato might help.  The chicken was over cooked and dry.  It tasted like chalk.  We likely will not return but loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but the cookies are magnificent! Best cookies I've ever had in my life. That's a very serious statement! Lol I highly suggest the corn cookie"}
{"text":"Three words:  Salted Caramel Macaroon.  The food was distinctive, atmosphere hip and fun, service fine but the glittery, indulgent simple dessert was damn near perfection.  In case you missed it, Salted Caramel Macaroon."}
{"text":"This restaurant has everything! Great food, great service, atmosphere, location, etc. The roasted cauliflower is so delicious and one of my favorite dishes to order.  Everything is made from scratch and absolutely incredible. Price is on the lower side so we always add dessert and coffee! Hands down the best hot latte on this side of the country. Great conversations with the staff who are so friendly and welcoming. Love love love!!!"}
{"text":"Eat the Rainbow. Trust me. But I hafta agree with another Yelper that finds it difficult to know where to order. It's kinda confusing."}
{"text":"Love the vibe here, but the food was a little disappointing.  

This used to be the old Public Market Grocery Store, but after the store closed, the owners of St Francis restored it as an all day café serving farm to table foods.  The concept is great and the restaurant itself has a great neighborhood feel to it.  I went here with a date for dinner on a Tuesday and the place was way busier than we expected.  They have a great patio in back so we sat out there and people watched.  

I ordered the grilled cheese.  One question.  Where was the cheese?  The bread was very hearty, but I could barely taste a lick of the white cheddar in there.  Also got a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon and it was super cold.  I understand it's hard to keep wine at the right temperature during Phoenix summers, but they didn't need to refrigerate it that much.  My date got the Caesar salad and generally liked it.  She LOVED the Farmer's Cup cocktail.  I was tempted to grab one their displayed pastries, but took a pass this time around.  

I'll be back to try again (probably for breakfast instead), but I hope they step up their game a bit next time.  The setting of the restaurant and the freshness of the ingredients are such that they should be able to make this concept work."}
{"text":"Delicious food ! Awesome customer food! Very hipster and laid back. Everyone in there was in a great mood and it really set the tone for me; and the music was calm and soothing. I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was delicious! I had a great first time visit and I'll defiantly be back for more."}

- YES: pork chile pie!  YES: salads -- any of them -- wonderful!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  Can I just say this place is sooo good!!  I had the quiche plate and it was amazing and fresh and brilliant.  I am seriously going back today - even though I live half hour away - for their oatmeal apricot cookies.  They are the best cookies I have ever had IN MY LIFE!!!  See you soon Phoenix Public Market - save those cookies for me!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this ever since they reopened into the Cafe it is today. It is an awesome place to hang out with great food and people. I love the cafe and bar especially. The Espresso is good and that Nitro beer is great! : - )"}
{"text":"Came in for coffee at the Cafe during the farmers market on Saturday and received the worst service possible. I work in the service industry and could not imagine giving paying customers that terrible of service. When I went to the counter initially I was greeted by two men who did not say hello and their expression made me question whether I should get drinks from them in the first place. After I ordered my 2 coffee drinks I went with the cup for regular coffee to the canisters that hold the coffee while one of the bartenders worked on my latte (the coffee was for my boyfriend). The canisters were all just about empty and although I'm pretty sure they saw me trying to squeeze coffee out the bartenders did nothing. I filled half the cup with decaf because I wanted to avoid these annoyed looking guys who made me feel uncomfortable and inconvenient. When I went for the creamer it was empty and I contemplated just forgetting the coffee but decided to ask them for more. The whole coffee area was a disaster. My boyfriend had arrived by that point and felt the same vibes as me. The latte had taken a little longer than expected (which is fine) but because they never asked my name or gave me a number I went up to ask if the drink on the counter was mine and the bartender just laughed at me and said no. How the heck am I supposed to know if it's my drink!! They just set it there without saying anything! The whole experience felt condescending and uncomfortable which is a darn shame because the place is so cute and the farmers market is AWESOME! I'm sure the food is good but I would never go back in to try it or recommend it because of that experience. I definitely haven't been to a lot of \"hospitality\" based establishments where I feel like I just threw my money in the garbage."}
{"text":"I'm being generous with the 3-stars. I hate to be the messenger of bad news BUT... This place is not going on my fave list or re-visit list.

Service was meh, pumpkin soup was cold, pretzels were cold, jalapeño cheese dip cold & tasted processed.

I have loved Aaron's pumpkin soup at St. francis (sister location) and it's REALLY good. This one could have been much better.

The place has a really cool vibe, but the menu and food need to be revisited."}
{"text":"I could not be happier that my co-worker recommended this cafe for lunch one day. I love the lively atmosphere, but the main reason I keep going back is for the Chino Salad - the best asian salad you'll crave every couple weeks. I suggest getting extra dressing, it's delicious and you'll need it!

You can tell everything you eat there is freshly made and the staff is always friendly. It is a great local spot that many might not stumble upon, but it is definitely worth a visit. I have yet to try their brunch or bakery goods, so I will have to add that to the list for my next visit."}
{"text":"At last I have found a restaurant with lip smacking peanut butter cookies in the Valley and I have looked!  Just the kind my Mother, a gourmet cook, would have put in front of me!  If for nothing else than these cookies,  the Phoenix Public Market would get five stars.  As it goes the pork sandwich was very good as was the gazpacho soup with melon balls, a very nice touch.  A nice fennel salad on the side made for a nice over all impression on my taste buds!  

Go to this restaurant for an interesting meal and good service.  You'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Food is good and the bar is fun to sit at.  Can be a little crowded sometimes.  I highly recommend the pretzels.  They are delicious and so warm!  They are great to snack on in the winter with a beer.  The service is very good and friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered a hot chocolate. I didn't hear my name being called so they left it on the side with no follow up. Poor customer service. Never go here. They didn't try to rectify the situation after I followed up 15 minutes later.  

Do not eat or order here. Poor service."}
{"text":"Been back a few times for breakfast. Today I arrived at 9 on a Wednesday morning in June, so not many patrons. I ordered the biscuits and gravy, which had chorizo in it plus it came with two eggs. 

My breakfast took 18 mins to arrive. Hmm, only three other parties. Over the past few visits, the service has been dropping. I also got overcooked biscuits twice. 

Today's meal was on the better side of things but 18 mins was way too long for the few customers there."}
{"text":"Great place to bring family and friends for morning breakfast and yo shop from local vendors and farmers. Great clean fun and safe atmosphere. All the vendors are nice and provide great food. The prices range from 5$ and up some things are overpriced but everything is local art and food. Enjoy"}
{"text":"If you love food markets then I would say to come here. Outside there was music and tents and everyone was lively. The Phoenix market cafe itself was really good. It's quite a production to find a table and order but it was well worth it. I'd for sure go back and have it again. Cool ambiance as well."}
{"text":"Awful service. We came in and the hostess told us it was a 30 minute wait. We sat outside in the waiting area and after 40 or so minutes we hadnt been called yet. We approached the hostess and she didn't even have our name on the list. No apology was given and they wrote our name to the side. We were finally seated and the service was just as bad. The waitress did not check in on us after they gave us our food and we watched her and other waitresses socialize with friends. Not to mention the chips we ordered had burnt fries mixed it with them. We waited a good 15 minutes to ask the waitress to bring our bill but couldn't even catch her attention while she socialized. We finally got up and paid at the registers. For a restaurant so well-known and prestigious the service should have been MUCH better."}
{"text":"I don't know used to like it. My dinner Sat in the window for a while till someone brought it over. The water station had no glasses. The floor physically looked filthy. I think this is my last time here.."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and came to check out the Public Market on Saturday morning (open from 8am-1pm). We had already eaten breakfast but we stopped in the Cafe to get a cold brew coffee and Americano. It was the morning rush so it was pretty busy, but that is to be expected.  Everything on the menu sounded delicious, so we came back in the afternoon for a late lunch, around 1:30. It was less busy than the morning, but you can tell it's a popular place! I ordered the kale salad (kale, beets, pomegranate seeds, cranberries, radishes, carrots, goat cheese) - everything so fresh and flavorful - worth $11!  Philip got the Tito's Cubano sandwich (rotisserie pork, ham, swiss, pickles, dijon) and he loved it. Great flavors and not too heavy (didn't leave him feeling like he needed a nap). Also they cut it into 3 pieces which made it easier to eat. There were so many things on the menu I'd love to try. It's a little pricey (sandwiches and salads range from $9-13) but worth it. They use fresh, local ingredients and the quality is over the top.

The open design of this place is very cool. There is indoor and outdoor seating, bar seating, high top/shared table seating. The time it took after ordering to get our food seemed a little slow - maybe because it was a busy weekend or maybe it's always a little slow. Either way, we weren't in a hurry & it was nice to take our time. Probably not the best option if you are looking for a fast meal.

I'd definitely recommend this Cafe, as well as the open air Public Market itself on Saturday morning!"}
{"text":"Note to self, try this spot if you are in Phoenix.  Yum.  

We ate here the day after Christmas, and it is a cosy dinner (or lunch/breakfast) spot, with wood plank picnic style tables and some regular tables too, as well as outdoor patio seating.  The inside looks rustic, with brick walls and open wood beam ceiling.  Candles and succulents were on each table, and funky art and decor on the walls.  It smells so good as you walk in the doors, and you can see samples of their dinner fare as you walk in, along with a pastry counter with delicious looking items all lined up to tempt you to lose your waist line.  Yum.

We were seated quickly on a Friday night, started out with some drinks (pitcher of beer- small, enough for two, okay, and that was a server error, we did not order the pitcher, and I had a Market Margareta, which was pink, lemony and delicious).  We also ordered chips and salsa (included guacamole, and two types of salsas, one green and one red.) The chips were freshly made with just enough salt, and the guacamole and salsas were also tasty.  

Decisions, decisions.  What to order?  I asked the waitress what she recommended, and there were so many things she said were great, I was a little skeptical, ha, but my husband ordered the pot pie (raved about on Yelp), and I ordered the rotisserie chicken.  The pot pie is not your mama's pot pie.  It is a delicious pastry shell filled with chili verde.  It was melt in your mouth delicious with a mild spicy flavor, that did not overpower.  My rotisserie chicken was neatly cut into manageable pieces which I appreciated because sometimes eatting chicken can get very messy.  It was moist and flavorful, and perfect.  It included two sides, and I chose a salad, and baked sweet potatoes.  The salad was small, with spinach and carrots, sliced red pepper and tomato, pretty little salad.  The baked sweet potatoes were to die for if you like sweet potato.  They had a lime butter sauce on top to give them a little kick, and they just melted away in deliciousness.  Yum yum yum.  

Also, get a free cookie if you check in on Yelp.  Yep, we had to do that.  We had freshly made \"nutter-butter\" style peanut butter cookies, which I loved.  We ordered freshly made gingerbread loaf for breakfast the next morning.  Super yummy.  

They are into fresh, organic and local foods, have cute planters with produce growing in the front, they have a bar area and a happy hour.  They have a lot to offer, and I would love to go back again, but since that would be a four hour drive for me, I will just have to wait until I come back to Phoenix. 

Okay, go already."}
{"text":"Really debated giving this four stars, but I'll stick with three. Had lunch here with my parents before they headed off to Oregon, and I suggested this place because I had always wanted to try it and it is close to my office. Got the Rachel sandwich which was very good. I got a side of broccoli as well. This is going to sound super weird, but the broccoli was reallyyyy good! No idea what they put on it, but it tasted like lemon and butter with a tad bit of salt maybe. It was perfectly cooked too. My parents seemed like they enjoyed their food. Everything was very healthy but still tasty. This is one of those places that seems consistently good, and an all around go-to lunch spot if you're in the area. Would I go out of my way to go here (I live in Tempe)? No necessarily. Though I do want to try their breakfast one weekend morning!

My main complaint and reason for three stars was their espresso. I ordered a shot, and it had to be the worst shot of espresso I have ever had. Very Very bitter (and not in the good way that espresso is supposed to be). Though I did just return from Europe several months ago, so many my standards are still too high? Anyway, I'd steer clear of their coffee. Normally I don't think something like this would be a big deal, but I love coffee with every ounce in me. And a bad espresso is no bueno in my book."}
{"text":"My food was delicious but it was a little pricey. My sandwich, fries and lemonade ended up costing about $24.00 including the tip. That's a lot of a weekday lunch. I had the Cuban sandwich and it was fantastic. The fries were cooked just as a like them and the peach lemonade was amazing. I need to try and figure out how to replicate it at home. 
My co-worker ordered the BBQ sandwich and several different cookies for us a to share. The cookies were good but so rich and buttery.
We both left stuffed and happy but despite the food being great I won't be going back anytime soon because it is a little pricey for lunch for me."}
{"text":"Decided to try something new (the lumberjack Burger) it was delicious!!  And to make up for my last experience the manager covered my meal and my sons meal! As, always my waitress was super sweet."}
{"text":"Good food had Rice Bowl. Out of many items on a Saturday night
Will come back
Busy late Saturday night"}
{"text":"This food was amazing the salads are so fresh and flavorful, the carrot cake is rich and not too sweet, and the service is efficient and attentive. Love this place."}
{"text":"Really fun and neat location to grab some food, drinks or dessert.  Everything looked great and people were eating all types of items off their menus.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"When in Phoenix, you must visit here! Unique and varied menu, hip atmosphere and great service. I had the chile verde pot pie and I'm still dreaming about it. It had tender meat, rich and savory flavors topped with a flaky, buttery crust. Their Moscow mule was fresh and a great value for the price. Wish I weren't too full to try the cake but I took a cookie to go for later an it was great too."}
{"text":"Nice spot to grab something to eat any day of the week, or weekend. With a nice little outside patio, walk up food counter service, and a full bar you think that its perfect? wait it gets better with the different event they Cafe puts together; food trucks, farmers markets and more. The Phoenix Public Market Cafe is doing things right and I like that."}
{"text":"Always great service..the employees really seem to enjoy their job. Great food and fun atmosphere. While on business we always eat here several times for both breakfast-great coffee and dinner. And we love their sister restaurant St Francis too! The ballarina cookies and the cowgirl cookies are soooo good."}
{"text":"We love St. Francis. We're regulars there, and when we heard about the new place, we went to give it a try. We liked the vibe and the location is fine for us -- we're about five minutes away. Should be a popular place on First Fridays! Nice menu, free seltzer water on tap, and you pay up front and they bring your meal to the table. It's a good start. 

But there were a few things wrong, at least in our first attempt. I'll go back, because I know this place is still working out the kinks. First off, I'm allergic to eggs, and I told them that at the order counter (but admittedly, the conversation was more about the mayonnaise in the coleslaw). They served my pulled pork with an egg bun, unfortunately. The sandwich is about $10, so it's pricey to have as the only thing on the plate. Should be fries with it at that price.

One of us got a great looking baked sweet potato that really was consumed quickly. Another person ordered a salad, and it came with a whole lot of ingredients that weren't listed in the menu. It had to go back a couple of times -- they really need to either make it the way it is listed on the menu, or advise those who order that it has a few \"bonus items\" included (\"The Chino,\" $10.50). 

The atmosphere is nice and the management is, like St. Francis, very accommodating. I can't give this particular $40 investment anything more than two stars, but I'll be back because I like their potential and the owners were so successful elsewhere that they ought to be able to fix these issues. (And to St. Francis folks, please, please, please . . . Don't put eggs in your buns, or at least offer an alternative, because you do this at both restaurants. Good fresh bakery items don't have to have eggs.)"}
{"text":"I had the Sonoran Caesar salad today.  It isn't good.  The salad doesn't seem fresh and the flavors don't seem to go together."}
{"text":"Love LOVE this place.  You will too!  Same owner that owns St. Francis on Camelback.  Two tips:  1. Why wait an hour at Matt's Big Breakfast if you can get an even better breakfast here with no wait (yes, I have had every menu item!).  2. While the lunch and dinner menu has at least one item that will wow you, so too will the homemade desserts!

Order at the counter and then find a place to sit.  The beautiful food will somehow find you."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a last bite and drink before hitting the road back to Vegas. 
This was our best meal in Phoenix! This place is unbelievable! It was Sunday at 5:30pm. There was no wait and maybe 10 people in the main room. We were greeted and seated right away. The decor is wonderful, with cute, real votive candles on the tables. 
We both had the 3 course dinner for $12.99, and it was amazing! The salad was fresh greens with just enough tasty dressing. You choose between 3 entrees, we both had the BBQ platter. The chicken and pork was crazy good! It was so tender and fresh. It came with fries, shaved red cabbage, and corn bread. They were all perfect portioned and tasty. For dessert you get a yummy cup of organic ice cream. I can't believe quality and the amount of food you get for only $13!!
I had a $5 HH Sangría and it was very good. They must marinate the fruit a very long time. 
My boyfriend had draft blonde, light and refreshing. Their Sunday HH is 3pm- close.
Nice location, near downtown Phoenix, with their own parking lot. The service was great as well, our waiter checked on us frequently and we waited maybe 10 min for our meal.
You definately can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Don't forget to order the Biscuit and Chorizo Gravy.

It would not have been my first choice had it not been recommended by a fellow foodie.  The meal is flavorful and the biscuit is cooked to perfection. This item gets 5 stars.

Be sure to order it early because I hear they run out of this breakfast item often. 

There plenty of gravy so consider ordering an extra biscuits for dipping.  Just saying...."}
{"text":"El año pasado estuve en phoenix y fue una gran sorpresa este lugar todo lo que comió estuvo buenísimo y fui varios días a desayunar y lunch. Muy recomendable."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Phoenix, I feel as if I have found my go-to lunch spot but Phoenix Public Market Cafe has set the bar too high. 

First off, awesome decor and interior design. They allow their customers to choose how casual or proper they'd like to be with their picnic bench style, coffee table and bench or regular table arrangements. A seating arrangement for every soul and mood. I liked the barbed wire bathroom art too - very ranchero. 

Food: lentil and cocunut milk soup was awesome if you want a vegetarian version of Thai Tom Kha soup. Regardless of weather, soup always warms the soul. I also ordered The Rachel and that was another great sandwich with their delicious rotisserie chicken. Swiss cheese, red cabbage and that Russian sauce is always a great mix but then add some sourdough and I am sold. As a bread snob, I loved the sourdough and its toasted perfection. 

A++ for a great lunch under $10-15"}
{"text":"Could easily spend a whole day here.  Lots of food options, comfortable and plentiful seating, and great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the new Phoenix Public Market Cafe. Our food was good, we ordered a chicken bbq sandwich and a burger, neither come with a side. Overall, I feel that it was over priced and over hyped. I am sad because Phoenix Public Market used to be one of my favorite places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is the last time I am eating there. Most of the meals are not having any taste here. My favorite is Rosemary chicken and frijoles and rice bowl but otherwise it's too much money for boring food. Atmosphere and service is pleasant. Drinks are good but pasta, cauliflower, burger - all are tasteless. 

There are better options around unless u are interested in socialization."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp we didn't miss this gem as a lunch stop before flying out of town. Loved everything about it: delicious rotisserie chicken meal, great music and patio, and worked for the whole family (free easy parking, great beer list, kid friendly). Well done!"}
{"text":"Good, but not too impressed.  I was in town for a night and decided to come here since it was close by and had great reviews.  I ordered takeout here so my experience is not based on dining in the restaurant.

I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and it was pretty good.  The bread was very toasty (I love that) and they had seeds inside the sandwich that kept the chicken from feeling mushy when taking bites.  However, the portions were a little underwhelming for what I paid for.  I got a toasted sandwich with no sides for $10.

The atmosphere is great.  The restaurant is dimly lit with candles, wood tables, and a brick interior.  They play some hip music and have a bar.  I can see how this can be a hotspot for a young crowd and students.  Unfortunately, I came alone and did not dine in.

Good atmosphere, but I was a bit disappointed by what I paid for.  This definitely a place you go to with some friends to grab a meal or some drinks."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Once in the morning for breakfast and another time for lunch. I got an egg dish for breakfast and as far as I remember it was decent but not spectacular, certainly not memorable. This weekend I came for lunch because I heard they had a pretty good pork chili verde pot pie. I'm pretty much a pot pie fanatic so I had to try it. I found the pie to be a good size. These things are pretty deceptive though because they look so small but they're incredibly dense and filling. The pie was stuffed with generous chucks of delicious pork in a chili verde sauce (as you'd expect) but the crust was not flaky enough in my opinion. In fact, the crust was so stiff I couldn't even cut into the pie. I thought perhaps it was just a one off sort of thing but my parents also got the pot pie and had a similar complaint. 

There's a lot of great food in downtown Phoenix and I do like the ambience of Phoenix Public Market but the food just doesn't hold up terrifically."}
{"text":"I have to keep it real. I had high hopes after following the scrumptious pics on ig and reading the great reviews. We stopped by for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. I ordered the Mediterranean salad and added chicken for $3. I asked to substitute the feta for goat cheese and the gentlemen said it was no problem. Assumed ingredients would be straight of the farm with a placed called \"public market\" sadly red peppers were pickled. The chicken had rib meat and looked/tasted like a store bought rotisserie. The best part was the day old toasted bagel and yes, they forgot the cheese.  My husband had the Del Real sandwich which he claims was decent but definitely overpriced for what it was. Left disappointed  and hungry."}
{"text":"Love the vibe. Great chicken salad sandwich. Little bakery area also has some good stuff (but changes daily)."}
{"text":"Best veggie sandwich ever! Rotisserie chicken excellent too. A great fresh spot for a filling healthy meal. I also love that they serve sparkling water!"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place in Phoenix. The chorizo biscuits and gravy are to die for. They also make one of the best lattes I've had in the Phoenix area. Good local brews on tap and a hip, yet casual and peaceful vibe. I love coming after the breakfast rush to sit outside, have a beer and relax. It almost feels as if you're not in the city."}
{"text":"A teeny bit pricey but delish! And unique. Great atmosphere. Not totally kid friendly but you can definitely bring kids here."}
{"text":"I originally had a 1-star review of this restaurant. One night I wanted dinner but didn't want to go far so decided to try Public Market again. 
I'm not sure what they did to change their quality from my original review to now, but holy cow. It's a major difference. 
Now this is one of my favorite restaurants! Amazing breakfast food as well. The cinnamon rolls are to die for!"}
{"text":"Cute, hip cafe. Cozy atmosphere. Great food! We got the Biscuits with chorizo gravy and the devil's mess, FANTASTIC flavors!! The parking lot adjacent has open air market Saturday AM. We stopped by before our breakfast, great time!"}
{"text":"Ended up here by accident but glad I did. Very friendly staff lovely open air indoor/outdoor seating. I had a burger upon recommendation of the friends I made at the bar. It was good, the green chili was subtle and the bread was amazing which is often (for me) a make or break it for burgers. 

The Sangria is amazing and I'm feeling gratitude for the accidental nature of finding this spot."}
{"text":"I am confused how this place has so many 5 star ratings...my cubano was very dry and bland with almost no meat. Over rated no doubt"}
{"text":"I think this place was unique and delicious. Sort of small menu but a variety of foods for different tastes."}
{"text":"A great place to have lunch & close to work. Felt like having breakfast for lunch & tried The Devil's Mess with a side of crispy new potatoes. Deeelicious!! The pastry selection is awesome!! From homemade PopTarts to Lemon Bars. I took a dozen macaroons back to the office & all enjoyed!! Will definitely come back to try other items on the menu & for happy hour!!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad. We stopped at the cafe for dessert and coffee, but after sitting at a table for more than 20 minutes we gave up and left. The server promised water when he took orders for the couple whose table we were sharing. Their drinks came, no water. Their food came, no water. They were 1/2 way done eating and we still hadn't given anyone our order or received our water....so we left. We will just make a point to only visit the cafe during the day when we can order at the counter and seat ourselves. :-("}
{"text":"I'm not sure I'm hipster enough to chill at this place but I figured I would give it a try.

Cesar salad was good.  Loved the croutons and the very garlicky dressing. I thought it was a little over priced.  $2.00 for a can of Diet Coke? 

Very cool atmosphere and the farmers market next door was super cool."}
{"text":"Visitors from out of state highly impressed with the service congeniality excellent food deserts handcrafted Bakery Goods just a wonderful wonderful experience. The staff really made it an exceptional visit cafeteria-style with numbers but don't let that throw you from having just a great great time. Wonderful bar drinks the macaroons are not to be missed if you do can't help you. The sundae dessert has a little chip of a honey Butter Brickle honeycomb that is to die for sure wish they would sell it."}
{"text":"I have dined here too much to not review this wonderful establishment!

To all of the students out there, SHOW YOUR ID! You get a GREAT discount!
To all of the 3-course-dinner lovers, COME ON SUNDAY/MONDAY! ($12.99 3 course meal on Sun/Mon)

What makes this place great for me is how casual breakfast/lunch can be but when it comes to dinner, it's a sit-down/table service establishment. The wait staff are knowledgable about the menu and the menu reflects what is fresh about the foods!

Some personal favorites include the Devil's Mess for breakfast and the Sonoran Salad (add chicken!!! (it's their rotisserie chicken)). When they have specials, definitely go for it! That's always going to be their freshest and most creative option."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a quality nutritional breakfast.  Everything is cooked well.  I am staying in Phoenix for a week and I plan to eat breakfast here everyday.  The service is fast and friendly as well."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch.  Got the Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie.  Savory, scrumptuous, complex.  Sorta like a chicken pot pie, but with a twist.  Also got the fresh orange juice, which was on point.

The ambience is probably the best part, it's open market style.  Felt like being in Portland or something."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and wonderful customer service.  Food comes out tasting delicious and promptly as well!  Super yummy pastries!

I love the feel of this cafe, it's very open with lots of opportunity for interaction with your fellow community members.  This location is great too!  Centrally located on Roosevelt Row. 

It's only a matter of time before Downtown turns into the city it should be, and this cafe will be poised to be right at the heart of this miraculous transition.  Go now before it's blows up and the lines run out the door!

Also, 20% off with ASU student ID, so crucial and sweet!"}
{"text":"This was a great find tonight!  The overall design is warm, contemporary and inviting. Service was on point and the food was delicious.  Great date night spot!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place for lunch- The food is great, The ambience is on point, and the staff is very friendly but professional. Hands-down so far this is the best place I've been for lunch in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Husband and I had an hour to kill after the shopping at the farmers market so decided to check out the Cafe.  I had the Iced Summer Brew which is a cold brew coffee infused with white tea, coconut & vanilla.  I added a bit of half and half and it was delicious with such the right amount of sweetness.
We tried the macarons and they were yummy.  At 2.00 a piece, I am not sure how great that price is but it was fun to try them.
Atmosphere is cool, casual and comfy with friendly staff. My husband and I were trying to take a selfie when a server quickly approached us and cheerful asked if she could take the picture for us. 
Service is quick.
Bathrooms are clean."}
{"text":"Good food and a nice venue. Located downtown Phoenix, good place to bring out of town visitors. Remember to reserve seating after a certain time or you will be waiting unless you don't mind sharing a table. Had the Cuban and wife had the prime rib and it was good. Will likely go back."}
{"text":"This place definitely has a wow factor and it gets the job done if you want to eat something okay for cheap and relatively quick.  But I really don't love the food either.  It's good for lunch and if you don't have a lot of time, but if you have time and a couple more bucks to burn there's better options."}
{"text":"I have to admit my visit to this cavernous café was probably an incident of bad timing as it coincided with my one and only visit to the adjacent Public Market which happened very early on a Saturday morning at 8AM. It was so early that the market was just starting to get set up for the incoming masses, but the café was already open an hour and had quite a few diners devouring their breakfast plates. The Rooster Booster. Biscuits & Gravy. The Devil's Mess. Lots of chorizo, lots of carbs, very Southwest. Although the dishes all sounded delicious in their own artery-clogging kind of way, none of them sounded promising enough to appease my flexitarian dietary concerns.

I ended up ordering likely their most boring offering, the $7.25 bowl of Granola, Fruit, and Yogurt billed as vegetarian and gluten-free (photo: http://bit.ly/2iJZjxy). It was certainly big enough, but the proportions appeared out of whack to me. The chunks of fresh Granny Smith apples comprised the most dominant ingredient, and the obviously housemade granola was poured liberally over it. What was missing for me was a hearty enough serving of yogurt to lubricate the granola and apples. I was only left with the mixed berries to help me down as much of the granola as I could, which was not even half of it. The coffee helped as the beans came from a local chain, Cartel Coffee Lab.

FOOD - 3 stars...hefty bowl of granola and not that satisfying, the salads sound promising
AMBIANCE - 4 stars...spacious and very Southwest
SERVICE - 3 stars...on the meh side
TOTAL - 3 stars...think I'll come back for lunch the next time"}
{"text":"After a delicious experience with their Blue Corn pancake, I was looking forward to a repeat this Friday morning, What a disappointing experience this was! There wasn't any \"blue corn\" color nor flavor on the food today. It seams that the pancake absorbed all the burned bacon fat of their griddle, the whipped cream without any sweet honey flavor. What a way to ruin your Friday morning."}
{"text":"A quick search for 'breakfast' on yelp brought me to this awesome place! I was staying in downtown and needed to find a place to grab food and to get some work done - this was the perfect place. They have an indoor area and small patio area outside. 

I got a hot tea and a devil's mess! It was delicious and very filling! I loved how the dish was served with a side of tortilla so I basically made my own breakfast taco! Yum! 

I ended up staying there for 2 hours to do work and ended up ordering a chicken quesadilla and fries to go. The quesadilla was flavored well but the draw back was the ratio of chicken to cheese was 3:1. Would have liked more chicken! 

PS. Checkin and get that gooey delicious cookie! :) And they have sparkling water on tap!"}
{"text":"Yup!  I'm a major fan.  I love that parking is so easy for a downtown restaurant.  The place is cute and you can dine in the restaurant portion or enjoy the bar or outdoor patio.

The service was very friendly and helpful.  I like that I can get unlimited amounts of water myself when it is hot.

Tried a bowl of the yellow lentil coconut curry soup.  It was huge and delicious and came with two slices of bread for only $6.  My daughter got a lemon bar out of the display case that was amazing for $2.50.

I can't wait to come back and try other things.  The prime rib looked amazing but I was feeling to frugal to pay the $19 price tag."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the better places to grab a great meal with even better service near DT Phoenix. Two prickly pear ice tea carafes were hammered down and I didn't even have to bother to ask for them. Food is just as good as their service and Gabby is a splendid personality and server! Also have awesome bakery treats!"}
{"text":"Phoenix Public Market is my new favorite lunch spot. During the week I work all around Phoenix but I keep coming back here for more. 

I love the free parking they offer and it's covered which is a huge plus. They offer a variety of foods which range from breakfast, lunch and dinner. Most recently I had their quiche and the lox bagel. The quiche was moist, rich in flavor and definitely a repeat for me. The Lox bagel was alright but the price was much higher than anywhere else I have purchased a Lox bagel. I have had other for cheaper that are on par if not better. I would suggest going for a more hearty meal when you visit here to get the best bang for your buck.

Seating can be tricky at times, especially during the lunch rush. If you don't mind sitting with some other people working on their computers, then there's room for everyone. I would suggest trying here since they have a large variety to offer. I just wish the prices were a little more reasonable..."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and drinks. Good service most of the time. Convenient location with adequate parking. Perfect spot for an evening with friends. Only downside is that they close at 10 on weekends."}
{"text":"Today my fiancé and I went to Phoenix Public Market Cafe with my sister and her boyfriend for lunch. It was a last minute decision to go over another place we had planned for, but I am super glad we ended up there :) 

I love how cute the restaurant is, the service was quick, and the food was delicious! My fiancé had the BBQ Pulled Pork, my sister had the Chicken Quesadilla, and her boyfriend had the Tito's Cubano. I had the Chicken Salad Sandwich and fries, and we all shared the House Pretzels. Everything was amazing - the only thing I didn't try personally was the Cubano, but those who had some said it was amazing. 

We also got some free Chocolate Chip Cookies for checking in ;) those were so good, too! 

I definitely can't wait to go back to this spot and try more of the menu options - I'm really interested in trying their breakfast since everything else was so good. I also want to check out more of the local goods they sell at the front, so cute that they have that! 

Definitely recommend going here if you're in the area! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Amazing menu, great drinks, super friendly staff, great location and just all around great vibe to this place.  We'll definitely add this to our regular rotation...guess we're not the only ones though as this place gets pretty busy."}
{"text":"Great spot cool atmosphere awesome food pretty great staff. Just a really cool environment to either work and have a meeting in grab a quick bite or sit on their awesome patio great spot I love it"}
{"text":"The Cartel coffee they serve here is really really good, and all the baristas/bar tenders are very attractive. The food we got was good, but the portions were a little small and plating was not anything to write home about. 

We sat outside because we have a dog, and were disappointed there weren't any outlets. However, insode and out, the place is very pretty. The tea was also very good, and well worth the trip."}
{"text":"I have come here many times and feel amiss for having never written a review. Phx Public Market is wonderful. The atmosphere flows with positive energy. From the large open space wth lots of windows and open air, to their friendly staff who take the time to answer any questions you have even when it is packed, it is inviting. Food is delicious. I had a cinnamon roll that topped the charts of all cinnamon rolls I have ever had. And I have had my share. It was warm and fluffy, with just the right amount of frosting and cinnamon.  Coffee is great and if you want a drink their bartenders know what they are doing.  They will craft you a well mixed drink or pour you one of the many delicious beers they offer.  I often frequent on Saturdays during the farmers market but prefer other days when it is less busy."}
{"text":"This place is cool they have some healthy options including vegan and gluten-free etc. they also offer 20% discount to ASU students. I understand that they source local ingredients but their menu is kind of overpriced. Today I ordered the soup of the day and asked if it was gluten free, two employees, including the guy taking my order confirmed it was. So I ordered a small soup and got charged for a large... No big deal. The soup came and it was the large size...and it had these crispy croutons on top and also two pieces of toast on the side. Did the guy not understand I was asking about gluten free for a reason? I couldn't finish the soup but it did taste pretty good, but I was worried about the gluten. This experience bummed me out, I got over charged for my \"side of soup\" which was a huge bowl and my gluten free request wasn't considered. Still a nice place though, I'll probably return for coffee. I do love the sister restaurant St. Francis!! I'd recommend this place but if you have allergies or intolerances makes sure you tell them at least twice!"}
{"text":"I hate the interior, it's always too loud for a quiet or friendly conversation. I guess the high industrial ceiling lends to the awful noise.
But between the breakfast burrito and the carrot cake, the place is good"}
{"text":"If you live in the vicinity of the PPMC....I supremely envy your the blessing of your proximity.  Simply put: if you enjoy delicious food, don't wait for Wednesday/Saturday to roll around.  Celebrate your taste buds!  Go forth, and fill . your . face!

I popped over for Saturday morning breakfast.  I opted for the full service bar, though you may order at the counter and seat yourself (later in the day they have patio seating near a woodstove!).  At 7am it was easy to get a seat, but I had been warned that Saturday is their busiest day - so be wary of late brunch rush.  Each of their breakfast offerings were tempting, but I was captivated by the Evans-Churchill.  Two poached eggs over market-fresh veg sauteed in agave + pesto, dressing up a foundation of quinoa.  Vegan/gluten-friendly and all for $10.25.

A cup of Cartel coffee (so delicious it needs not cream nor sugar!), and my Evans-Churchill + a side of potatoes ($4 for 4 baby-fist sized potats!) - I was in heaven.  Sunshine, excellent indie-rock buzzing through the room, a video loop of reaching and growing radishes over the course of 42 days, and did I mention the flavor explosion in my mouth?  AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

While I was absolutely busting at the seems, my eyes were still hungry for more more MORE of the menu!  Freshly squeezed juices offer the perfect compliment to the full bar offerings.  So SOOOO many plates: Eat the Rainbow (steamed and raw veg with a variety of sauces), Chicpea Pancakes (with banana and almond), House Pretzels (with jalapeno cheese sauce) - the list goes on, and is ever-evolving, revolving with the seasons.

And for checking in on Yelp, I got to take a cookie (a scrumptious pecan sandie) for the road!  The PPMC is one of those places that when you leave, you look longingly over your shoulder and whisper like Harry Potter, \"I'm not going home, not really.\"  The tip top crown of my brief Western adventure, and so much to warm a polar vortex heart.  I will return to AZ, if only for another breakfast in the sunlit table tops of the PPMC."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun. In the daytime, it's a go up to the counter and order for yourself kind of place, and in the evening it turns into a sit-down restaurant. 

They have delicious treats (macaroons, brownies, little cakes) in the front case that are always available. And if you check in on Yelp, they'll give you a free cookie with any purchase (I got the corn cookie)! 

Their breakfast is served until 3pm, and it's always delicious. I love their chickpea pancakes!! Their ingredients are always fresh, and they serve an amazing mimosa. 

For lunch or dinner, definitely try the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich. It is one of the best pulled pork sandwiches in town. They also have AMAZING starters, like the downtown devil fries, nachos, or pretzels. 

I love coming here for happy hour after class/work with my friends as well. They have some great beer on tap as well as a kick-ass sangria. 

Service is usually fast and friendly, and I love the vibe of this place. They have cute little items in the front you can buy, like local cook books or other goods, and they even serve Cartel coffee at the bar. 

Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Great service, free parking and good food.  What more could a foodie ask for?  I had the pancakes but they aren't made like your Grandmothers hotcakes.  I'm not going to discuss the ingredeints you just have to order them and try them for yourself. FYI if you Check in on Yelp you get a free cookie.  If you show a student ID you get a discount on your bill."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying this place for a long time, sadly disappointed. The food itself is ok, but the portions are very small. 
I had the Devils Mess which is billed as eggs, farm veggies, schreiners chorizo and chiles. What I received was a couple of scrambled eggs a piece of spinach and a couple strips of chile with a slice of cold half buttered stale bread. No fruit, potatoes or sides came with it.
I brought four college kids and all ended up going back for pastries to fill up."}
{"text":"Downtown Phoenix has so many places that serve delicious foods. This is one of them. A little more pricey compared to your average breakfast spot, but it's expected considering you're in the heart of PHX. Having said that, the food is worth every penny.
Walking in, we weren't sure if we waited to be seated, but then I noticed menus in a stand, and realized you just skim the menu and the walk towards the back register to place an order and find a seat. There was no wait, and the place was lively. 
I had the breakfast sandwich Flanched Flarney Garney--not sure what the name means, and even though the name annoys me, the ingredients were fresh, the bread was perfection, and a little tobasco sauce enhanced its flavor. Came with a side of pickle and slice of watermelon. It was very filling. Hubby had the Devils Mess--the tortilla was delicious. It was almost, dare I say it, maybe just as good as Los Hermanos tortillas from Superior. Daughter had the grilled cheese-she said it was yummy and the bread was very soft and flavorful. We all split a ballerina cookie for dessert and it was unlike any cookie I've had, surprisingly awoke my sleeping sweet tooth. We will gladly be back!"}
{"text":"Came here only for drinks, the kitchen was already closed. Great atmosphere and location, the staff are friendly and easy to get along with! Had a great time.

Will definitely return to this cafe for some lunch and happy hour before a game downtown."}
{"text":"We went here several weeks ago and I wanted to post because it's such a nice place. Both of our meals were HUGE and delicious, much more and better than we expected. The staff was so friendly and accommodating; we brought our toddler and they helped sort out a tantrum. Very caring people."}
{"text":"The food here is great, and I love that they sell local products, but sadly the service is not very good. I have been here a couple of times and each time I have been disappointed. The last time I was here my order came out 10 min before my partners. 10 min. I would prefer they hold my food rather than have to sit and look at it while we wait."}
{"text":"It's a really cute restaurant but honestly, the food falls flat. It's nowhere impressive, and very expensive in my opinion."}
{"text":"Wow! My mom and I are in love with this place! The indoor/outdoor space itself is lovely! The wait staff is wonderful! The food is fabulous!! The rainbow vegetables with three dipping sauces is not only beautiful but refreshing and delicious! We shared the green chili pot pie...the crust was buttery and flaky! The chocolate chip cookie was divine!
They clearly use the finest ingredients and yet the prices are very fair for the quality and portion size.
20% for ASU students! Highly recommend and we will definitely be back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"I liked the ambiance, very laid back and friendly. It is a community gathering place, and on this Friday evening, quite a few young families were there. Very kid friendly. Somewhat limited space indoors, but also had outdoor patio that appeared to be dog friendly. The only drawback on this night was our soft pretzel appetizer we ordered with our beer. The first one they brought out was burnt. We had to send it back, it was so charred. It took them two minutes to bring out a replacement, but it was still cold inside. Apparently these are frozen and thrown into the oven for a few minutes? When our waiter asked about this one, we told him it was cold and he just nodded his head and moved on. Probably didn't hear us and assumed we said fine. At least it was edible and actually would have been quite good warm. Did not eat a meal, so can't comment on the food. Will definitely go back and try it again. Happy hour included $5 for select pitchers of beer, which basically was 2 pints. A really good deal if one of the 2 selected beers are to your liking. The beer selection was pretty minimal, but they had 5 or six craft brew taps."}
{"text":"After much thought of where we'd brunch amidst the breakfast oasis of options that Phoenix has to offer, I decided upon Phoenix Public Market Café. It was a lazy Sunday around 11:30am, I had time to kill and I was prepared to wait in line. To my surprise, there were only two people in front of me! Wait, what I am I supposed to order? The menu had many salivating options and I was one of those people who just couldn't decide right away. To add to my mental food frenzy, Phoenix is no longer my home and I only return every couple of years so I had to make a good choice. 

Thankfully, my girlfriend, a regular at PPMC, came to my rescue and recommended the pork chile verde pot pie. The pork chile verde pot pie was an excellent choice! It was delicious and had the most flaky and buttery crust ever! Pot pies are one of my many guilty food indulgences and this was definitely one of my favorites! The portion size was generous and I did not finish, but maybe it is because I also ate a side of bacon, a lemon and pistachio macaron, and a yummy, large peanut butter cookie sandwich with my meal! What can I say, I'm only in Phoenix every once in a while!

The service at PPMC is friendly and prompt and the ambiance is casual, inviting, and hip. I love the market meets café idea. The outdoor area had picnic style seating and fresh flowers adorned each table. It was a cheerful atmosphere for a wonderful brunch in the beautiful Phoenix sun. My next visit to Arizona, I will surely return to Phoenix Public Market Café and dine again!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh, it was good and flavorful, But for Over $10 my rice bowl left me hungry just an hour later.

From an economists standpoint this would make for a great diet.

On to details, the rice bowl had julianed peppers and other fresh well prepared veggies, brown rice and a creamy sessamee ginger sauce, it was not cold but not a hot dish. I did enjoy the sauted mushrooms in the dish. If only there were more of it.

The format here is, order at a counter and take a number. come early for lunch as the parking and tables fill up quickly."}
{"text":"Phoenix public market has a nice interior, very hipster vibe which fits with the neighborhood. I got the rice bowl for lunch. It was well made but a tad overpriced for what I got (rice, avocado and some veggies)."}
{"text":"Ok food. Had the Cuban. Pretty good but made me super sick later. My wife and beans and rice and also felt sick after. Strange that we both got sick, that never happens. Rice and beans, gauc and Cotija cheese for like $9.00. It's was very bland. Ordered Broccoli with lemon and olive oil. Nope. Under cooked, no lemon and no Olive oil, no seasoning for $4. So, not sure what the deal was but probably not going back. I wanted to love it but just over hyped phx stuff! The Cuban had potential but bread was not toasted well for a cuban, could not really taste much but the mustard and pickles with a hint of Pork. No hint of Swiss which tells me the Swiss is not high quality. This is actually the MOST important aspect of this sandwich. Should be equal amounts of Swiss and pork on this. Not horrible but could be improved on. I think the key is proper toasting of bread and using proper bread. There should be no twist to this. Using french bread is not appropriate. No Dijon either, just plain yellow mustard, dijon is over powering. Of all the Cubans I have had in Latin American countries this one was not on par. 

UPDATE: Manager offered us a refund which I have taken. I do appreciate them trying to rectify the issue. I hope my feedback helps them become better."}
{"text":"This place is great.  They do a lot with vegetables including wonderful salads and other vegetable dishes.  Mmmmmmmm !"}
{"text":"Your pre-DBacks' game destination! This is the perfect stop for an amazing burger and cold beer or tasty cocktail before a ballgame. The happy hour is pretty good and the service is friendly (especially if you're tender is Clay!)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  I dig the rustic, re-purposed old building thing.  Get there early to sit on the patio.  I had the Cubano sandwich and my guest opted for the pulled pork.  The Cubano was ok, but the pork was terrific.  I'll be back to try additional items on the menu and to enjoy the ambiance."}
{"text":"Food 2.5
Food was okay. Typical/standard breakfast fare. Line moved relatively quickly despite a lot of people but the kitchen was struggling to keep up. Came in relatively early in the morning and already had ran out of many of the food items.

Atmosphere/Service 2.5
Took forever to get a table and staff didn't seem to be in a hurry to clear off tables. Cute decor but just not a great space and ended up with a lot of waiting."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious I must say!

Whenever I visit somewhere out of state, I always love little nuances when it comes to places. I noticed this place taking great pride with their vegetables. I had a medley of baby carrots and roasted brussell sprouts to go along with my 1/2 rotisserie chicken and french fries. Great taste, good flavors and wonderful presentation.

Lets not forget my choice of a free cookie with a \"check in\". Chocolate chip seemed too safe so I went with the corn cookie. Yes it's a cookie made from corn. How much of it is made from corn?  I have no friggin clue. Regardless, it tastes yummy to the tummy so that's what counts!

They also have a decent selection of signature cocktails and beer. Gotta say this place stands out the most when I visited Arizona."}
{"text":"Great service today! I definitely recommend The Hulk fresh squeezed juice! Delish! Lots if friendly staff here today!"}
{"text":"A casual energetic urban center with a MOSTLY health focused menu unless you notice all the baked goods. They do slow wood roasted meats on a rotisserie. You order at the counter get handed a number find your seat and they run your order out to you unless you just go for the grab and go section. Also a small amount of mostly local goods including books and nick knacks and some grains.

I tried a salad called Public Market Vegetables. It was a mix of marinated, steamed and raw vegetables and went for the add on chicken up charge. It was a very fresh tasting salad with a stunning mix of vegetables of different textures. Carrot ribbons and spiral crisp carrot spaghetti, sprouts, fresh dill, spinach leaves and marinated cauliflower, broccoli and other vegetables. The white meat chicken seemed poached and was very fresh. For me this salad had too much acid in the dressing or maybe just combined with the marinated vegetables for me but I still thought it was a very above average salad.

My husband loved the Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie. The pork was tender with a really perfect spice level and all that tasty sauce just melted into the crust like butter.

They have all kinds of seating here. Sofas tables with chairs and bench tables.

The restrooms are unisex.

Your silverware is in a bin on your table and you have to hope little kids didn't play with your utensils before you used them."}
{"text":"I try not to be too critical of places when they first open, but I have given the Public Market two tries and they've disappointed both times. The first time I ordered an iced americano at the coffee bar. Their large drinks come with two shots, so I asked for an extra shot, it came out to four dollars. When I got it it was still extremely watered down, so I went back up to the counter and explained to the guy and just asked him if I could pay for another shot. I had 2 bucks in my hand and he grabbed the money and stuffed it in the tip jar! After I got my americano it was still gross and watery. 

The second time I came here for breakfast and only got a glass of water and bagel with the herb cream cheese. The bagel was as hard as a rock and the cream cheese tasted (and looked) more like herb mayo. Gross. 

I've heard they have a good happy hour for cocktails, so maybe next time they'll redeem themselves."}
{"text":"I really do not want to be hard on the Phoenix Public Market Cafe. They capture my design aesthetic so well, the exterior is also outdoor diner dreams, and what a prime location. However, its their menu that just left something to be desired. First, it's not a very dense menu. The options are fairly limited, especially if you are looking for vegetarian dishes and seafood. The prices are also quite high for what you're getting, but I may have just not enjoyed my particular meal and gotten the wrong thing. 

I am willing to come back and give this place another go. It really does have all my favorite design elements and a cute cafe/coffee menu that I want to indulge in sometime soon.

Here's to a happier future between us, PPMC"}
{"text":"AGH. SO GREAT.

I walked in and LOVED the atmosphere. Such an old school café! All the workers were very friendly, lowkey babes and their macarons were gosh darn unbelievable.

YES. Yes to everything YES. If you haven't been to Public Market, the time is now. I am a better person after this visit."}
{"text":"Love the patio!! Stopped by here the other day for about the 5th time.  Sampled the house cab which is on tap and served slightly chilled. Mmmm so good!!Also ordered the chicken salad sandwich. Great combo!! Thoroughly enjoyed my experience!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a late night snack... Chocolate cake was waiting for me. I was late but the staff was able to accommodate a table for 8 people. They also give ASU students 20% off! Had just black tea and a slice of cake. The cake was pretty good , moist little bit of mousse and enjoyed the icing. Also had a taste of the pop tarts ( not the biggest fan) and the macaroons (texture seemed a bit too chewy for my liking). Enjoyed the atmosphere and tables were comfy for a big group. I'll be back to try some of the dinner items."}
{"text":"I had the Arizona Burger, which is a delicious, juicy green chile burger on a brioche bun.  It came with a crunchy pickle spear and a slice of watermelon.  I also tried some of their sparkling pomegranate juice  (yum). The service was friendly and fast.  The atmosphere is open and very relaxing."}
{"text":"I love almost everything that Chef Aaron Chamberlin does and the Phoenix Public Market Cafe is no exception!

The AZ Burger is one of my favorites. The green chile isn't too spicy and it adds a wonderful flavor to the perfectly cooked patty. 

They also have a full bar and great happy hour deals. I'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"I'm in love, seriously.  I had the best breakfast in years.  It was really simple, just eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast but all the ingredients were fresh and it really hit the spot.  My partner ordered the frittata, which was also excellent.  It was too hot to sit outside.  I can't wait until the weather cools down so that we can sit on the patio.  I think we may even be able to bring our dog on the patio...I am so happy that more good restaurants are opening in Central Phoenix.  Living down here gets better and better."}
{"text":"The Flanched Flarney Garney is one of my favorite sandwiches in Phoenix! Service is great and fast -- and everyone is super nice. And I love to sit out on the patio."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was fast and staff was attentive. Nothing to complain about. Anything with pork seems to be a winning dish."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a great review, but...
We stopped in the afternoon the day of our arrival in Phoenix and really liked the look and feel of the place. There were chickens in the rotisserie and steaming hot pork roast on the carving block. We had already had a late breakfast so we planned to return another day.

We did. And I ordered the BBQ Platter, with that pork on my mind.

When it arrived the chicken was warm, but the pork was cold! it has warm BBQ sauce on it, but it was cold. They were probably thinking that pouring hot sauce on old, cold pork would heat it enough. It did not. Not smart. If your intent is to pass off old cold pork as fresh, at least heat it up first! Geez. I explained to the waiter that it was cold. 
I think they tried to heat it, not sure. It came back slightly warm and super dry.

I was super bummed and disappointed."}
{"text":"Phoenix Public Market combines many things a man like me loves: Fresh produce, non-processed food, all with a localized impact. I rarely eat at chain restaurants these days because of the high quality dishes local spots like Phoenix Public turns out.  PPMC is right at the top of my Local Eats list and is a perfect spot for a lazy Saturday or Sunday morning. SO... lets delve into it a bit deeper, shall we?

~The Good~
Besides featuring local produce, meats and others in their menu, they also feature local items in a small shop in the center of the store. From the very beginning, the owners made it very clear this is a spot by Phoenicians, and for Phoenicians. I take pride in having my own place that features the best of my home, and boy are the dishes delightful, to say the least. The layout of this spot is trendy inside. You can pick a table or even snag the bench seating in the far corner of the restaurant. They have comparable seating along the bar area to sit and drink at. You may not notice it, but there is ample room out back flush with bench seating and a blown out wall where the bar extends out further. 

As for food, the breakfast is to die for. I have tried numerous options, but the simplest item on the menu, Steel Cut Oats Risotto ($7.25) is my favorite. There is more than enough oats for 3-4 sittings in this bowl, which filled me up in about 5 minutes. My father opted for the Rooster Booster ($6.75) which he devoured along with a side of Crispy New Potatoes ($2.50). For lunch, my personal favorite is The Rachel ($8.50). This sandwich offers the eater a slice of roasted turkey, sauerkraut & coleslaw, all melted together on sourdough with Swiss cheese and dressed with a light and slightly sweet house dressing. The sides they offer all the way to the right of their big board are plentiful, and I chose a huge heaping bowl of broccoli which was sautéed lightly in butter. This added to my meal substantially and I was left finishing my dish...barely. Every meal here is properly portioned, and you get your money's worth in quality and freshness. 

Really quick, the Happy Hour for drinks is superb; cocktails are made fresh on the spot for $5 each and taste delicious. The bartenders sling really good drinks here guys, you can come here anytime for food, but it's also a perfect treat for Happy Hour!

~The Bad~
I can't think of anything bad... the portions you get aren't huge. We as a society are used to huge portions for small prices. Issue is, you are probably not getting your money's worth at such restaurants. Here you get what you paid for. Lines can be long at certain times of the day, especially for breakfast. So please plan your trip accordingly. They also do not have any rum drinks on the menu, so for my fellow rum lovers, we are SOL when it comes to the bar. It does give you a chance to try something different...but still that's disappointing.

~The Downlow~
Overall this is the quintessential 5 star spot. They are trendy and hip, the location is stellar, the community involvement is top notch, their farmers market is a fun added touch, and most of all: their food is AMAZING! All of those reasons add up to 5 stars, and a very happy Jefe. I suggest this over most breakfast eateries in Phoenix. Come an enjoy, you won't be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Always dependable on fresh delicious meals, if you're broke,  order the black beans and fries from the sides menu or split a full meal with a friend.  

They serve Cartel coffee so if you're sad Cartel coffee downtown closes way too early,  you can still go here.  

Loses one star because they raised the price on their fresh squeezed juices and I'm sad about that.  At least half it and sell it for $4ea. 

Awesome pastries, try the poptart, you will need thrilled!"}
{"text":"We've been here before for coffee/pastry and its' always been great! But last night we were here for the wine walk jazz event put on by DTPHX. We enjoy the wine and the music for a while and then headed inside for dinner. The restaurant was crowded, loud and had a great vibe and we seated ourselves very quickly. I ordered the chili verde pot pie which was amazing, it sounds strange but its a must try !! everyone else ordered the AZ burger which was also delicious. Our friends order the kid's grilled cheese and it looked like a grilled cheese that I would want to eat! Their kid's meals are $3--- you can't be that!
It was a great experience and we will go back. And seriously---get the chili verde pot pie!"}
{"text":"I still do not understand why I have not written a review for this place. I absolutely love it here, the staff is mad friendly and  the service is always excellent. Gabi, who has had the misfortune of having helped  me ( and i need a ton of help most of the times!!) several times is just phenomenally awesome!!  They have great food, do not sell starsucks - they have local cartel (boom - instant five stars!!) They have clearly marked vegetarian and vegan options and did I say the service was stellar ? Good food, good drinks, good atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Highly, highly recommend! This was a second choice given the restaurant we were going to go to was closed. Nice variety on the menu. Hubby had salmon ... a very generous portion with fresh vegetable assortment and potatoes. I had coconut curry lentil soup... Excellent! Plus also ordered the rice bowl which was chock-full of fresh veggies on a bed of rice. We plan to be back!"}
{"text":"In the mood for a great dessert? COME HERE!!!!

Had a wonderful late lunch here the other week. 

We tried the BBQ pork and the AB&J.
BOTH DELIGHTFUL!!! I have been craving it ever since!

We also got a couple of baked goods A couple for there, a couple to take home. 
We tried the chocolate cream pie (I think that's what it was called)... PURE HEAVEN!!!!!
Creamy chocolate filling on top of caramel, nestled in a crumbly sweet and salty chocolate shell, topped with some type of amazing whipped sweet creme. WOW! A MUST TRY!  
We loved it so much that we ended up being 5 total to take home and share with people. I also took home a pecan sandie cookie, a chocolate cream filled sandwich cookie, and a homemade pop tart. ALL WERE TO DIE FOR!!! That stuff barely lasted the weekend! 
We loved this place so much that we are HIGHLY considering make a grab-n-go station at our upcoming wedding out of their delicious sweet treats. 

You must tell people of this wonderful wonderful place!"}
{"text":"So delicious!!! And despite being packed, we were served quickly and somehow still found a place to sit."}
{"text":"Scrumdidliuotious.  Been here a few times and the food is amazing and I'm on the Keto diet, so I asked for a few specific things and they gladly accommodated.  Atmosphere is grand and music is great too."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan. Great atmosphere with friendly people at the counter. Brunch is especially good here. 

The coffee smell is amazing!

Beautiful outdoor patio that is dog friendly."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! This may seem weird but their French fries are amazing! Just the regular one or the devil fries with the Russian sauce.  The cookies are amazing! They are fresh and even have options for vegans. This is he perfect place to eat when you have a crew of omnivores and carnivores. Oh, let me also mention, the grain bowls, even though usually served cold, can be heated and meat can be added. Just kicking it up a notch"}
{"text":"I went here last evening with my boyfriend and his sister. The three of us were famished and we were looking for a small joint near downtown where we were attending a handful of First Friday events. When we arrived it was very busy, but we quickly understood just why it was so popular. 

The three of us sat outside right next to a crackling fire place and waited to be served. We were quickly greeted with a carafe of water to sip on while we decided on what we wanted. Our server let us know what they we sold out of before we wasted our time trying to figure out our options. Once we ordered, we had only a short amount of time to speak amongst ourselves before the food came out. The food was splendid and our drinks were divine. Our waiter was the coolest kat. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in this place I had to write this review right away. I came here this evening for happy hour. I saw they had woodchuck on draft for $5 a pitcher and I just had to check it out! 
I came with my friend and it took us 17 minutes to be seated! Not too horrible if it was busy, however it wasn't busy. The problem was that there was a sign that says wait to be seated, then the bartender said it was all open seating, then after sitting at the tall table next to the bar we were told by the host it wasn't open for seating THEN he clocked out and never actually seated us so as soon as 2 stools opened at the bar we just sat there since no one came back for us. 
Seating issue figured out. Yay! On to chips and salsa... We ordered chips and salsa which took 29 minutes to come out. I felt like we were being punked or something. Even the nice ladies next to us mentioned to the bartender that we were still awaiting our chips. Btw the salsa and guac was mediocre at best. After all of this we weren't even interested in ordering an entree. I had my eye on the pot pie but they were out of it anyway. 
To sum it all up, if you are going to sit at the bar and are only interested in the happy hour specials, great! If you want good service, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"4.5 stars! The Phoenix Public Market Cafe is a really cute place - love the look of the interior, brick walls and lots of wooden tables. They've got a big menu with lots of vegetarian and vegan options, as well as some gluten free and fairy free options too. I came here to eat twice on my visit to Phoenix. The first time I came, I had breakfast and ordered the Devil's Mess, scrambled eggs with spinach, chorizo, chiles, and onions. I also ordered a latte (with almond milk instead of regular), a strawberry poptart, and for checking in on the yelp app, I got a free cookie! For the cookie, I got to choose from what they had in the display case, and I picked the corn cookie. 

I don't normally eat poptarts, but there were so many yelp photos of it, so I decided to try it. And it was delicious! Definitely not like the store-bought packaged poptarts. The outside pastry part was soft and flaky and the filling was really yummy. The corn cookie was really good and you could see actual corn kernals in it. This may actually rival Momofuku's corn cookie! The Devil's Mess came and this was also really delicious - the eggs were cooked perfectly and the chorizo and the chiles tasted great. The dish came with a tortilla - I wasn't entirely sure if I was supposed to build myself my own breakfast burrito with it. The really nice server came by to ask how my food was and he told me that next time, I could order the Devil's Mess as a breakfast burrito, which is really good to know. I just ripped the tortilla into pieces and ate it with my eggs. The latte was really good - I had originally asked to get it with soy milk instead, but the cashier recommended that I get it with almond milk. I really enjoyed my dining experience! 

I came back a few days later to eat lunch here with a couple of people. I was still craving something breakfast-y and couldn't decide between the Evans-Churchill and the Chick Pea pancake, so I asked the cashier. She immediately recommended the chick pea pancake, which is vegan and comes with sliced banana and agave syrup. We sat in their outdoor seating area, which is shaded. Just a warning, there may be some pesky flies if you sit outside. I thought the chick pea pancake was just okay. I didn't really like the flavor. I wouldn't order it again. I did also get to try the house pretzels with the white cheddar sauce and this was really good. 

You order first at the cashier and pay, you get a number and they bring you your food to your table. Water is self-service and you can get it at the water table, just next to the entrance to the outdoor seating area. The service is excellent, most of the food is amazing, the space is really cute. They use as much local and organic ingredients to cook their food, which is great. Definitely a great place to eat in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places i have discovered while attending school in Phoenix. The atmosphere is amazing, and they have an unbelievable music playlist. The food is amazing, and I've tried both their breakfast as well as their dinner appetizers. I highly recommend the pretzel bites! Love this place"}
{"text":"Might be one of my favorite downtown Phoenix spots! Always delicious food that is on the healthier side! And everything tastes super fresh as well. They have a great happy hour- the nachos are literally amazing. For brunch their bloody Mary's are also fantastic. I am never disappointed by the public market. It is service at the counter unless you're at the bar then it's full service but all of the staff is always very friendly and happy to assist."}
{"text":"Super big, nice atmosphere, order at counter then sit down style. Good breakfast. Workers were busy so kinda friendly but distracted. Yes I would go back and recommend."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix on vacation and ended up eating here four times - twice for breakfast, a lunch, and one dinner. Laid back atmosphere, everyone is super friendly, and was never too crowded. The frittata, devil's mess, fried chicken, and rotisserie chicken were all outstanding. Coming from Washington, DC the prices were very reasonable. I hope to come here again, and again.  Highly recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"This place is good for breakfast, brunch, or lunch and has cool vibes. Good for groups and kids--there's a decent amount of food in the kids meal for only $3. You could also probably come here on your own and get some work done during off-peak hours. The pork verde pot pie was pretty good, a little spicy. The pulled pork sandwich was average. The Cuban sandwich was surprisingly good. The best part about this place was probably the free cookies with Yelp check-in. I'd first recommend getting the oatmeal apricot banana cookie, or the ballerina cookie if you're craving something chocolatey! Parking is nice--has its own covered parking lot (but open), so your car can get some shade."}
{"text":"What a fun coffee shop in downtown Phoenix! Reminded me a lot of Portland with a South West flair. 

Excellent food, amazing coffee and even a play area where my daughter made friends."}
{"text":"The service here continues to decline. I live in the neighborhood and really want to love  this place but the evening crew declines with each visit. 

1) appear annoyed we even came in 
2) didn't bother trying to seat us despite a wAit to  be seated policy in the evening 
3) not busy at all and waited 10 minutes for anyone to come to the table   Despite bringing food to the table next to us and chatting with the folks at the bar behind us. 

They no longer have dinner specials ... and have gas no new items on the menu in over 2 years 

Really unfortunate ..."}
{"text":"SO MANY FLIES EVERYWHERE. I love(d) this place but I can't stand the flies :( biggest pet peeve! 
On the other hand, curry coconut soup is amazing- VEGAN! A must try."}
{"text":"I go there all the time and I tip good. I received chicken that was raw and showed the counter person the picture, the reaction was oh well, bummer! She had the nerve to charge me again. Can't believe people at this place are like that... I love this place, but can't ever return."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food from Phoenix Market; it's typically sure good (especially the biscuits and chorizo gravy - it's become a favorite of mine). Decent rotating seasonal beers, too! Give the macaroons a shot, if you want a sweet treat; they've got a nice variety, and my girlfriend always picks up a few.

The service has been hit-or-miss, though two of the regular waitstaff are always friendly and excellent at their jobs. Don't expect them to perform like a typical waiter, though, that's not the set-up. Order at the counter, wait for your food to be dropped off, and leave it at that; they'll chat you up at the counter, joke, and make recommendations, but don't expect more.

I would give them a higher rating, but unfortunately, the past two times I've gotten coffee here, I got sick. I'm not a big coffee drinker, but I've tried a few places, and none of them have made me feel this bad afterwards. :-("}
{"text":"I love the look of the cafe, it was very modern industrial. The service was quick. But I was surprised and disappointed that they did not offer any gluten free bread. While boasting lots of alternative diet options on the menu, I found it surprising that they didn't have that. So while I wanted to order a sandwich, I ended up having breakfast food instead. Eggs were cooked nicely, but I was hoping for more of sweet potato fries vs a whole sweet potato that had been cut into 1\" slices."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting both the market and the cafe.  I loved the atmosphere of the place.  A bit hipster in design, but not obnoxious.  The staff is super friendly and they let you sample the beer they have on tap before you buy!  The food was great.  I got the pork chile verde pot pie, and it was delicious. Just eating the crust of that pie will hit your calorie limit for the day, but damn its worth it.  I wish phoenix had more places like this.  Being able to walk around the farmers market afterwards was a definite bonus."}
{"text":"So glad I stopped here! The cookies were So good!! I got a pulled pork sandwich with fries and my friend got the veggie sandwich With mashed potatoes. Yum!  everyone that worked there was really friendly and made us feel really welcome."}
{"text":"Super cute decor, friendly hip atmosphere, and really fresh delicious food. My favorite part has to be the cocktails though, which are expertly crafted and SO tasty. They also have cold brew coffee and espresso, and a really cute gift selection! Patio seating and indoor/outdoor bar is really cool as well. Only down side is every time I go it is packed, so sometimes seating is difficult to find, but it is still worth it!"}
{"text":"Last night, we celebrated one of my closest friend's birthdays out on the patio. I think our group ended up being around 11 people or so. Our waitress, Gabby, had the most cheerful and positive disposition ever! We were so grateful that she was able to accommodate our large group and even be our photographer at the end of dinner because those are definitely two annoying things that large groups can be! To make things worse, we had split checks and since couples sat across from each other, it made things even more confusing and she still was super patient with us and so very sweet!

As far as the food goes, the fried chicken was delightful! Each bite of meat was tender and moist and full of flavor. The fried breading part was what had my heart skipping a beat. It had the texture of typical home cooked thick fried chicken would feel like but it tasted like I was eating a homemade biscuit - flaky and scrumptious. The entreé dish was large with the greens and mashed potatoes so I had trouble eating everything, but my friends who were on vegan diets at the time were cheering me on to finish every bite. They were telling me that I missed a spot here or there because they admitted they were envious they didn't take a break from their diet and order the fried chicken as well. It was hilarious! 

The happy hour was great too! I tried the Lee Trevino and it was refreshing but had a great spicy kick to it. At the end of dinner, they did a made-to-order iced coffee with whiskey and it was a great dessert substitute for me and helped me stay energetic for the rest of the birthday shenanigans. I really like this place a lot!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been to numerous places with the same business plan in mind, but what makes this place EXCEPTIONAL is their service! Who doesn't love friendly hello from the cashier? I was craving breakfast so I had the Rooster Booster! It came out in a timely manner and was exactly as I would have expected it. I am looking forward to coming back for happy hour now that I work in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I went to ASU downtown so this was a common spot to settle in with some classmates with a cup of coffee and poptart. It's not anything for me to run home about and recommend to everyone I know and meet but it's decent enough for me to come again if I were in the area. The Strawberry pop tart and a vanilla latte is by far my favorite quickie little breakfast there. The basic bacon, eggs, potatoes, and toast breakfast can't really go wrong. I did get the burrito once and was really very unimpressed. Be warned, the music is loud but there is a great, downtown hip atmosphere with a garden lining the front of the restaurant. I enjoyed sipping my lattes and eating my poptarts on rainy days with the big windows on the south side of the restaurant. It's at least worth a shot if you want to try a restaurant with subtle changes to the standard breakfast feasts (ie., chickpea pancakes, whole potatoes in stead of hashbrowns, genuinely decent espresso from the coffee bar rather than some rando half-assing the espresso machine)."}
{"text":"This is a downtown gem! The food is delicious, and I highly recommend getting the peanut butter cookie as a sweet treat."}
{"text":"Fresh food. The Devils scramble is really good. Egg, chorizo, peppers. Just the HOT if you like it spicy."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for happy hour with my husband and loved their selection of drinks. Today I came for lunch with a 3 year old, I had the Roosevelt Row Bagel which was so simple and delicious with the homemade hummus and smashed avocado, just the right amount of sprouts, very thinly sliced onion and tomatoes? red peppers? It was delicious and came with a slice of watermelon and a pickle. The (very adventurous) 3 year old had the curried coconut lentil soup and while he was more interested in the free corn cookie we got for checking in on Yelp (also delicious) he actually seemed to like it quite a bit. I snagged a bite and it was pretty good! The coconut and the curry balanced eachother well, nothing was too overwhelming. The only downside was the lack of indoor seating. Luckily the patio was shady and had misters. I will definitely be back to try some more of the menu!"}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite places to go.  The customer service here is awesome!!  The environment here is fun, lively, and unpretentious.  The waitresses here are very friendly.

The food is above average.  The nachos were very good, friend chicken is great, the porschetta pork belly sandwich was mouth watering delicious!!  Unfortunately it is only available as a lunch special occasionally on Saturdays.  The southwest pasta was very good as well.  The rotisserie chicken in the pasta was dry and bland tasting.

Sangria is decent.  The food here tastes very fresh.  I cook so I know when food is fresh.  The fries here are also good.

The lemonade is too sweet that it tastes gross.  Service here is kinda slow during dinner time on weekends on order taking and bringing out drinks.

Overall, I usually have a good time when I come here."}
{"text":"Great fried chicken! Actually all the meals ordered were great! Some of the desserts taste a bit stale so be careful of that. The chocolate chip cookie was very good !"}
{"text":"Short walk from the Sheraton. Excellent value and extremely friendly staff. Ordered the huge and delicious Suny's Breakfast Burrito. The coffee was great too. I saw three other breakfast items that I will try on my upcoming visits to Phoenix. Great atmosphere. Don't miss."}
{"text":"Food was really good and the patio was great. Bartender was amazing loved her! Everyone in our party loved their plate."}
{"text":"My love and I ate here this past weekend, it was great! I had the Devils Mess and he had a Burger both were large, fresh and delicious. Service was fast and friendly and although it was a busy Saturday afternoon we were able to find a seat quickly. We are planning to go back in the near future! Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Every thing is fresh and delicious.  Their pastry is really good. The burger and salads are to die for. We I do recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place several times for lunch. They have all the offerings you would expect form a bistro with a lot more. They do their own rotisserie chicken and always have a succulent special on the go. They have awesome salads and cater to the Rabbit-food crowd with ease. They make their own desserts, and have a little grocery isle offering interesting food items as well as other nicknacks and fun stuff. I have never been disappointed in anything I have ever had there, most recently the kale salad with chicken added. 
If you go there for lunch during the week or for brunch on the weekends it will be BUSY! If they only have one cash open the line forms very quickly and longly, so if you are in a rush, I would go elsewhere, as once you order you wait at your table and they bring the food out to you. One cool feature is that you can get a self-serve glass of regular or sparkling water free of charge on tap including citrus slices. They have a full bar that can be sat at inside and out. This is one of our go-to places when wanting some decent nosh when downtown. Be aware that the prices are somewhat pricey for those who buy their lunch daily. My salad was $9.00 plus $4.00 to add chicken. So if you usually like to keep linch under $10, I would go elsewhere, but definitely splash out once in awhile for some delectable and mostly locally sourced delights here!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here last week for some quick happy hour drinks. My wife and I arrived and sat at the bar on a friday around 4:00pm. They had a pitcher for beer for $5 bucks and bartender was telling me that they partner with a brewery in New York that makes a specialty brew just for them. It was pretty good and for the size it was definitely worth $5. My wife got one of their happy hour cocktails and she enjoyed it. This is just a nice overall spot to hang out in downtown Phoenix. They have food, coffee, beer, cocktails, and a small little retail space. I still have yet to eat here but that will most likely what I come here next for."}
{"text":"It's always a pleasant experience to walk around the Downtown Phoenix Market on the two days a week that it's open, but then there's the Phoenix Public Market Cafe, which is open EVERY DAY from 7 AM to 10 PM!  Whether for a meal or a coffee on my own or with others, visiting the cafe is a great place for people watching, mingling, and of course, enjoying good food and drinks.

My own personal favorite reason to stop by is meeting up with friends for brunch on the weekends or on a day off.  During extended breakfast hours (until 3), you can enjoy everyday breakfast combos like the Rooster Booster or more creative dishes like the Devil's Mess, which is convenience being right next to ASU (Downtown Phoenix Campus).  I've also enjoyed sandwiches and chicken dishes before.  

There is always plenty of parking though you may need to get creative if you're parking at a meter, street parking, or a parking lot.  Then again, there's always the Downtown Phoenix Market parking (though I've only parked there when going to the market).  

As for seating, there are limited seats, but it's fun to sit with strangers at the longer tables, which are in a sense community spaces.  Make a new friend!!

Note specials such as happy hour (daily from 3-6 pm for food and 3-close for drinks).  Also, if you check in on Yelp, you sometimes get a cookie!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here. I was recommended to go by a friend. The food was delicious. It melted in my mouth. The ambiance is lovely too. They had candles on the tables."}
{"text":"This place is super hipster, but it really is a must-visit restaurant in downtown Phoenix. While I am not a fan of the atmosphere (it is usually very crowded and loud), and I've experienced slow service, the food is great. I love the quinoa vegetable bowl that is topped with eggs, pesto, and agave syrup. The brown rice bowl is equally delicious and is topped with all sorts of fresh local veggies including avocado. And finally, their coffee hits the spot. On the weekends you can also explore the farmer's market which is literally right next door. I love it!"}
{"text":"Very fun place to eat. Good food, interesting atmosphere. Great vibe. Loved that they offered still and sparkling water."}
{"text":"Great brunch place, surprisingly good bloody Mary's and friendly service. 

Had their chicken pasta and the flavor was really good, would definitely order again but the pasta was undercooked and for a place that has an entire oven dedicated to rotisserie chicken I was disappointed to find only a couple of pieces in my meal. Love the play on biscuit and gravy with the chorizo too 

Bloody Mary 8/10 it was really good but needed more toppings"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town for a work trip and got a recommendation to go here. Such great food! Had the Cubano and it was excellent! It's on a fresh house made baguette toasted to perfection. We actually split it and ordered a side of fries. The fries were perfect also... not greasy and very tasty. Some fresh fruit also came on the side. Looks like they have a happy hour later in the day... When we come back to Phoenix we will definitely hit this place up again!"}
{"text":"Great food choice they make. The food was very good but it was not that warm. We had soups and a salad and a gluten free rice dish. The place is charming, clean indoor and outdoor and friendly staff. I ended up getting a pretzel. But the was not that good. It tasted like it was from yesterday(even if the guy at the register said they make them fresh every day) and a moist feel. They should not bake all of them in the morning but rather bake small amounts during the whole day. I come from the land that invented Pretzels :) and I would not eat a pretzel there again but their other food for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place especially ially the closeness to the public market. Food is deelish"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the staff is friendly and helpful and the food is spectacular!! When I'm downtown I try to come here as much as possible!  Also if you wanna get a drink, the Farmers Cup is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love the Public Market. Staff is awesome and the food always hits the spot."}
{"text":"We made the drive 3 weekends in a row. So worth it!!! This is our 6th visit and will be a regular spot. Their food almost makes us want to move to Central Phoenix. Farm to table fresh. My only negative is the music could be turned down a notch. 
Quoting my husband - \"The Carolina (today's special) gets 5 stars - that is a breakfast!!\"
Before leaving we placed a to go order. He welcomed us back, took our order and asked if we tried \"our\" muffin sampling. Now that is customer service to recognize a customer and refer to product as \"our\".  It makes a world of difference."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio for a quiet dinner alone to decompress while at a conference. Must order at the counter but they bring the food and the staff was friendly. The roasted cauliflower was exceptionally done - not overly greasy or mushy and served with flavorful mashed potatoes and pea sprouts. Vegetarian fare tasty enough for omnivores."}
{"text":"I absolutely fell in love with this place !!  It's super cute and the staff is amazing ! The pancakes are to die for ! Best pancakes I've ever had ! It's a MUST GO !!!!"}
{"text":"Bring back the corn cookies, my girlfriend makes me call everyday to see if you guys have corn cookies and every night I come home scared to tell her the terrible news. You guys are ripping our relationship apart."}
{"text":"I know many people feel that there is not a lot to do in downtown Phoenix......and for the most part that is true. However upon visiting this cafe I found a glimmer of hope for those who want a nice.....quaint.....relaxing.....and semi-romantic location to hang out. I hear on the weekends this place turns into an open outdoor market.....but I think I would prefer the nightlife when it transforms back into a cafe. There is nice mood lighting.....a stand up and sit down bar......huge wooden tables for groups of 4 or more......huge patio like tables for 6 or more......and of course your standard 2 and 4 person tables. The Patio is HUGE.....and I do mean HUGE......the cool zones are awesome blowing at full blast. This cafe is in a perfect location as well because there is tons of foot traffic and this place will definitely draw you in.

So why not 5 stars you ask? Well I ordered the rotisserie chicken (half portion) and the garlic mashed potatoes. Now for 12 bucks I really expected more.....also the chicken didn't have a strong rotisserie flavor like I thought it should have. The garlic mashed potatoes lacked the garlic portion.....but they were creamy and buttery. Don't get me wrong the food was very good just need bigger portions and a little more flavor. The service was outstanding and because we checked in through YELP.....we received a free cookie and even though they are gluten free......they are AWESOME. I had a banana oatmeal raisin which I didn't think I would like....but it was simply delicious. 

So if your ever hanging out in downtown Phoenix and looking for a good healthy bite to eat.....and perhaps some peace and quiet.....try the Phoenix Public Cafe. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really like going here for breakfast. The staff is always friendly and provide quick service. The food is good and the market is a fun place to explore when it's open."}
{"text":"Love their Ballerina cookie.   Dark chocolate, espresso, nuts.....YUM.  Quiche and salad combo...delish."}
{"text":"Still love it here but the sandwich does not look as pictured. Now it is just a reg two slices of bread sandwich. Still very delicious but smaller not sure why.  The chicken salad I am referring to"}
{"text":"Tried the Code Blue, which is their iced coffee shaken with condensed milk. Really refreshing- especially with the free cookie deal that's going on! The peanut butter cookie comes with peanut butter slapped on with peanuts on top. Really satisfying. 

Overall, a super cute place for a group that looks like it has a great selection for breakfast, lunch, and dinner."}
{"text":"My only regret about this place was that I only had time for one meal here during my weekend in town. Despite my affinity for cinnamon rolls, I bypassed their amazing-looking selection and opted for a more sensible chicken salad sandwich. It was perfect in flavor, proportions (not too much bread, no too much mayo), texture, and size.  If the cookies I took to go are any indication of the rest of their baked goods, I really missed out on that cinnamon roll! Everything coming out of the kitchen looked fantastic - even the french fries were a work of art.

Food aside, the atmosphere is lively and inviting - there were families, couples, singletons like me. Staff was super friendly, even late in the afternoon on what I assume was a busy brunch Sunday. They have a super bar area and great patio seating. Also, nice little selection of gourmet and eclectic gifts for purchase.

My next trip to Phoenix definitely includes a couple stops here!"}
{"text":"I do not have one complaint about this spot. I come here weekly! Everything I've had here has been absolutely delicious! All of their ingredients are high quality and super fresh.

I recommend the devil's mess or the breakfast burrito... So simple, yet so flavorful! And of course, the macarons! 

Also, 20% off your entire order with your student ID!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday brunch time. Wasn't too packed yet, but good amount of people dining in. Weather was nice so we decided to sit outside in the shade.

Food:
I ordered the bbq pulled pork sandwich, which came with some fruit and a pickle, which I don't really eat. 
BBQ pulled pork was actually pretty delicious, especially for brunch time. Lots of flavor and juicy bbq goodness with every bite. The sandwich is not that big, but It'll do for a brunch size fulfillment. You won't go into a food coma and will still be able to do things afterward. 

Would defiantly not mine getting this again. However, price is on the pricey side of $10.50 + tax. 

The inside of the building has a pretty modern and rustic environment. They do sell some phx souvenirs and the candles smelled good, but was also expensive for a tiny jar. 

They have a big menu as well, so  a good brunch place for different tastes. Will need to try the one closer to me around Chandler. 
Good hangout spot for groups. 

Service was quick. waiters are friendly."}
{"text":"LOVE. I had the coconut curry soup (vegan) with a side of fries and one of their local beers. It was delicious. So flavorful and SO filling! Plenty of food for the price. Great menu selections. Friendly staff, fast and efficient service, amazing ambiance, very clean, organized, and so welcoming. Adored the whole vibe of this place and would recommend it to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"4.5 stars........... what a cozy and friendly joint this is.  It has been on my list for months now and yesterday was the perfect opportunity.  I had 1/2 of their breakfast sandwich and 1/2 of their green chile burger, along with my free Nutter Butter for dessert (I love it when business give us a little something for checking in with yelp).  The breakfast sandwich (Flanched Flarney Garney) was just delicious.  The avocado specifically was spot on and totally made the sandwich.  The AZ burger was well cooked, but completely under-seasoned and bland.  I hoped the chiles would help, but they just weren't enough.  I had a pitcher (don't let the name fool you, this is basically two pints worth) of Orange Blossom beer and one of the Farmer's Cup cocktails - both were delicious.  To top it all off, their homemade Nutter Butter cookie was just outstanding.  The light and fluffy peanut crème in the middle was melt in your mouth-tastic.  I will have to come back during the open air market, I really like the vibe and atmosphere here - totally coming back!"}
{"text":"20% student discount for any student.

THE RACHEL ($8.95)
- rotisserie turkey, coleslaw, sauerkraut, swiss cheese, house dressing, melted on sourdough 
- all flavors blended well together that each bite was enjoyable
- turkey wasn't too dry
- quite small for the price, nonetheless would recommend!

CORN COOKIE ($1.25)
- FREE cookie with Yelp check-in
- weird taste; too gritty and not much flavor
- would not say I'm a fan

ENVIRONMENT: hipster feel. embraces community eating and definitely does have a market appeal. There is a coffee bar to one side of the place. The patio is perfect for those cool summer nights or when it's happy hour. Great place to catch up with people.

SERVICE: staff members were friendly. Food for take-out was prepared quickly. Had no issues with applying the student discount and Yelp check-in on one transaction. 

Great place to grab a sandwich or come to after work. The environment is very chill and open to making new friends. The food is solid, and there is a great variety that something is there for everyone. I would come back and recommend it to anyone looking for a casual quality sit-down cafe...with booze."}
{"text":"First time today at PPMC. Loved the layout of the cafe. Warm, welcoming and casual. Great menu to choose from. The food lived up to its promise that had the front of the house not been a total disaster, I would have given 4.5 stars. Regrettably, once the food left the kitchen, it seemed like the staff did not know what to do with it. Several if our items just sat there waiting to be picked up. Items were missed and even though the staff was very courteous in making amends, the experience was ruined."}
{"text":"I was here almost every day when I used to work at a company near by.

Service is amazing, Michael and Sydney are the nicest! Food is unbelievable! I have tried almost every single thing in their menu and I still have to find something I don't like. Their pastries are always good and fresh! And finally they served one of my favorite cold brews! 

Everyone should definitely try this place at least once... Then you won't want to leave!"}
{"text":"I think this is a very cool little restaurant. I had the veggie bowl and although some reviews said it didn't have much taste I thought it was good. All fresh veggies and a small amount of brown rice on the bottom. The dressing was really good and gave the salad a great spicy taste. It is what it is...fresh veggies, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, etc taste like they taste, you can't really change that. I think the reviews saying it was tasteless were kinda unfounded, you can't give veggies an extra taste unless you are cooking them in a sauce. My friend had the half chicken dish with cole slaw and a sweet potato with a good lime butter. She really enjoyed it. We both waited a little for happy hour and had the Chardonnay which was locally \"brewed\" and very good. I checked in with yelp and got the free cookie (cowboy) which was so good that I bought some other cookies to take home. I wanted to try the devil fries but actually was full enough on my food to not waste the calories! I will come back and try them. I love that it is also pet friendly on the outside seating area. The place is decorated very nice and has an inviting and warm ambiance."}
{"text":"Another Phoenix \"gem\" that wouldn't even rate in a city with a real restaurant scene. 

Even by restaurant standards the food is overpriced. They have a \"farm to table\" and \"local\" vibe but the menu never changes so not sure how that works.  Come here a few times a year because my wife likes it and it's only fair since I drag her places she'd rather not go. 

When I cook I never add salt to my food, but I find the food here to be under-seasoned and bland. My wife agrees on this point. The Cuban sandwich is a let down, but I've lived in Florida so maybe I'm spoiled. 

The quesadilla I had last night had two of four pieces with more than 50% emptiness (just tortilla in each bite I didn't eat). One of the two remaining pieces had about 10 of the 15 slices of jalapeño in the entire quesadilla.  All in one bite. Very lazy prep work. The cheese is good but not good for a quesadilla. Cheese oil was dripping all over me and making the tortilla soggy. Chicken was dry and void of flavor. 

The nachos were super dried out the one time I had them. Never again. 

The pot pie is the only menu item I'd ever order again. It's quite good. It's just very heavy and it wasn't an option this time since I had no place to store leftovers."}
{"text":"When I used to live downtown a few years ago-- this place was just a market with some items you could order to go with a coffee and wine bar.  

Recently I stumbled back in and the improvements are notable.  

It is a cool urban place to be--eat good food.  Great job and I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what every city needs; a place where you can feel at home and be inspired while getting to know your neighborhood. Great food and service and a real community builder! Phoenix is lucky to have such an awesome place!"}
{"text":"Great food and experience.  Fresh ingredients from local sources.  I recommend eating out on the patio"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Food, atmosphere, location and staff are all great.  I regularly get either the sunny breakfast burrito, a massive pop tart or the banana bread.  The coffee (from Cartel, I believe) is always good as well.  

I head here whenever I can find an excuse."}
{"text":"The menu looks small but there are so many possible combinations you can come up with. The baked goods are always stellar so save room for a treat. Breakfast is served until 3pm and Happy Hour is 3pm to close. For Breakfast I like the Rooster Booster or the Flanched Flarney Garney just depends on my mood. For lunch or dinner it's the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich, their delicous fries and Farmer's Cup always make me happy. I always intend to Eat The Rainbow however the intoxicating smell of slow roasting meat always changes my mind. This is a go to spot for fresh and local food; and you can't really go wrong with anything you choose."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite and left satisfied, but not blown away. My buddy ordered a slice of their carrot cake and I ordered the pulled pork. Let me first start by saying there was no fountain drinks. NO fountain drinks?!?! I get it, the place edges on the healthier side of things but dang if your going to kick out desserts, let a brother enjoy a little soda action. They do have Coke in the bottle, but come on that ain't the same. As for my buddies carrot cake, it was okay. One perk to being a yelper, your friends have to let you try their food. Come on, I am serving the community one taste at a time. Back to the carrot cake, it was dense and had a decent flavor. It seemed to have a slight heat aftertaste, which seemed a little odd to us. As for my pulled pork, it was pretty good. As other reviews mention, it could have used a little more sauce. The sauce though was good and I would order it again. A decent 4 stars in my book. The sandwich came with fries which were also pretty tasty. Lastly, with my Yelp check in they provided a free cookie. Can't say no to that! It was good, had nice flavor, I personally do not love though airy, puffy cookies. Overall, the restaurant had a neat vibe and the food was pretty good. Would stop by again, just with my own soda beverage in hand."}
{"text":"I really like what they've done here. Although I came in here for a takeaway lunch I would love to come back some afternoon for a beer or glass of wine. I hope they add to the menu because it could have benefited from a few more items. I decided on the  burger which was WAY too much bun (but the fries were OK). I wanted something warm so I did not take enough time to take a look at what salads and other pre-prepared items they had in the cooler.

I waited for more than 5 minutes before I was acknowledged and my order taken......this was late afternoon so the place was not crowded. The man who took my order also was not familiar with how to ring me up so I think that once the staff is more experienced and perhaps the service fine tuned I'm sure this aspect of the business will be ship shape.

So while I wasn't wowed with my experience I'll definitely give these guys another try. Since the bar area is nice (and you can't screw up beer unless it's Natural Ice) I know I'm at least bound to enjoy knocking back a few here!"}
{"text":"Tried this out while visiting the area- great food, super fresh (mostly) farm to table.  Wait staff was friendly, and the place has a cool, funky vibe."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants downtown. Always fresh with excellent seasonal specials. I finally got to try the verde pot pie, it was okay. My favorite is the Arizona burger - always cooked to perfection. The meat literally melts in your mouth. I always say I want to try their bakery items but I'm too full from lunch. Coffee is always good. Fries are delicious and crispy. The Cubano is amazing. But if you haven't tried the AZ Burger try it now thanks."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch and dinner with live music. We came in and sat down waiting for the rest of the party. A few of us went up to the counter to order some drinks. And when we were all here, we went up to the counter and ordered our food.

The fried chicken meal with mash potatoes and kale was delicious. The mash potato was so smooth, creamy and mildly salty. The friend chicken was crispy and tendor. It was seriously surprisingly good.

To finish the meal, each of us also ordered a few macarons! The peanut butter, the caramel latte and dark chocolate were amazing. Not bad spending a few hours there drinking a Sangria and talking and listening to the live music. It was really chill."}
{"text":"Solid food. I had the pork chile verde pot pie and my girlfriend had the pulled pork sandwich. The pot pie was very good and I would get it again. The pulled pork sandwich is slightly better than average for what you can get out of pulled pork in Phoenix. Anyways, the food gets four stars.

As far as the service, they get two stars. I have never had my food come out before my drinks. It's as if the server forgot that she put in the drink order and never went to grab them from the service bar. When our food runner brought the food out, we asked her about the drinks and she went to check. She brought back the wine and beer. I could tell they had been sitting there because my chilled glass had so much condensation that I had to pour out water from the bottom of it. On top of that, the server never acknowledged the oversight. I get mistakes and oversights happen, but please, just apologize for them and I'm over it."}
{"text":"My friend and I had lunch here and had a wonderful time. He had the Roosevelt bagel and a vegan oatmeal banana cookie. I had the black bean soup. The food was so fresh and the environment was so inviting. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the mild sunny day. 

One thing I loved about this place is when you get a water, you have the option to get regular or carbonated water. I love sparkling water so this made me really happy."}
{"text":"We stopped here for the first time last Friday evening around 6:30 p.m. with a few of my co-workers, and we all ordered something different so between the five of us got a pretty good range of tastes from their menu.  First off, the food was very good.  We started off with the Downtown Devil Fries and the Chips, Salsa & Guacamole, all of which vanished almost instantly.  I had the Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie.  I couldn't tell if the pies are made in advance and frozen or made to order (what threw me was that they are served in small foil pans much like the frozen pot pies you buy at Safeway), but the crust was outstanding, as was the filling.  No complaints about cold food here, as the pot pie was still VERY warm 20 minutes after I was served!  My partner had the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich, which he enjoyed.  However, he tends to prefer a creamy cole slaw rather than the dressing PPMC uses, which I believe is vinaigrette-based.  The only real surprise of the evening was more of a presentation issue than a taste issue.  One member of our party ordered the Roasted Cauliflower entree, which comes with mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes were very good and the cauliflower was nicely cooked, but rather than serving the florets or even somewhat larger bite-sized pieces, what ended up on her plate looked like someone had cut a head of cauliflower into thirds and cooked and served it that way.  Luckily she had a knife, but this meant, of course, that a good deal of what she was served was cauliflower stems, which although I do like the vegetable is not my favorite part.  Finally, as I am new to Arizona I don't know if anything can be done about  the flies, which may just be a seasonal annoyance due to the rain, but I think we'll sit inside next time we come back to try breakfast here."}
{"text":"I love the care they take with the food but I haven't found anything I love there yet. It's not bad, it's just not so good that I'll frequent it often."}
{"text":"I love visiting the Phoenix public market on a Saturday after a trip to the farmers market. I always order the Flarney Garney which is a tasty breakfast sandwich. I also go out of my way for their macarons.. the best in town."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a fan. Wished you opened a little earlier on the weekend. Will be back, have had lunch and breakfast and beverages and always great customer service and food and drinks. Like that you are dog friendly and that we have a place to lock up our bikes we choose to cruise around downtown."}
{"text":"Pros: super clean with exception of baby changing station in the bathroom, good sandwiches and the coleslaw was AMAZING!, kid friendly atmosphere, fair pricing, easy to find parking, casual. 

Cons:
We drove over an hour to have dinner with friends visiting from out of state and chose this place due to their menu stating specific gf options. This restaurant is severely misguided on what the gf is. You cannot label French fries as gf then verbally give a disclaimer of them being fried in the same fryer as their fried chicken. My children were stoked about being able to have french fries which is a rarity only to not be able to have them. 

I will never return or recommend this place to anyone for the simple fact that they mislabel and misrepresent their menu items which is huge. I also run a local GF group which I recommend places to and this will obviously not be one of them.  

Super disappointed in what could have been a new weekend destination."}
{"text":"Omg we came in for a Sunday morning breakfast and Wow....so awesome.  I had biscuits and gravy and it was like nothing I've ever had.  I should have taken a pic but it was gone before I thought of it.  Husband had standard bacon n eggs and a sourdough bagel.  All so yummy.  We will return for lunch and dinner.  Lots of great things on menu.  Great service too.   Six stars if I could ;)))"}
{"text":"I love this place, so it's about time I write a review. It's very convenient (free, roomy parking lot, which is hard to find at most downtown eateries) for healthy takeout as well as dine in. Perhaps pricey, but I feel the quality of the food makes it worth the extra dime. I've enjoyed Happy Hour here as well, and the specials are good. I tried the nachos during Happy Hour. They had lots of fresh ingredients and were delicious. Normally, though, I get the Eat the Rainbow salad, which is a dream for anyone wanting a super-healthy meal (not considering the included dipping sauces of course, but they are yummy). The service is also good here, and I love that they offer a free cookie with Yelp check in. All of their baked goods are amazing, especially the seasonal gingerbread."}
{"text":"My partner and I went here for a Film Bar collaboration. For the event there was not much of a choice. If you were vegan or vegetarian or just didn't eat pork you most likely didn't eat  the food you paid for in advance.  The waiter was very slow with a pompous attitude and I had to go up to the bar to get our drinks myself. We attempted to order a simple appetizer off the menu but ended up canceling the order after waiting 45 minutes. We left and had food elsewhere. The positive in the situation was they had live music. My partner never wants to go back but I may go back for the 90 shilling unless I find it somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is only about a meal I had.  It was takeout.  I got the rotisserie chicken, which seems to only be served in half portions, so no whole chickens are offered on the menu.  I had two sides that come in the price.

I got home with the vittles and when I opened the bag and pulled out the containers, everything was really nice and colorful.  I had sides of broccoli and sweet potato.

I started with the chicken.  It was a whole thigh (with leg) and a breast.  I searched around the container for the wing, and well, no dice.

I bit into my least favorite part, which was the thigh and all types of flavor came bursting from that juicy bite!  Nice hickory  / woody flavor and smoothly detached from the bone as needed.  Very tasty!

The breast was boneless and delicious as well.  Juicy and flavorful but small.  But honestly, I thought I was going to get an entire half chicken with bones, etc.  

Quality over quantity?  Yes, but I was hungry and would have appreciated all the chicken quantity and flavor still versus the little I got especially for the price.  

The side of broccoli was steamed nicely and the side of sweet potato perfectly baked.  

No true complaints here except the cafe markets the rotisserie as a half chicken and they should change that to just a boneless breast and thigh.

Overall, service was quick, professional and nice.  I'd order again, but maybe not when I am so hungry perhaps.

Would love to give a 5-star but I felt a little robbed because I don't like dark meat chicken as much as the white meat and with the missing wing, it was a bit deflating.  So 4-stars it goes for now."}
{"text":"Great vibe, casual crowd & a menu with many options for healthy & don't feel like so healthy eating. I enjoyed a happy hour glass of wine while waiting for my kale power salad, which was fantastic! As an added bonus, they had chia pudding, which is one of my favorites. Will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Despite its imperfections, I have to hand it to Yelp. Without it, I would never have noticed the Farm Cup on the menu and even if I had, would never have ordered it. It is right up there with the most delicious cocktail I've ever had (a jalapeno mojito at House at Secret Garden). It's rimmed in salt & pepper and has fresh basil and cucumbers in it. It's slightly sweet and pleasingly sour and absolutely refreshing and delicious.

I had the soup-of-the-day--pumpkin, which was sublime. The green chile burger was very good. Hubby's pulled pork sandwich was very good. Baked sweet potato had a yummy relish on it that was unexpected and very tasty.  I did find that the menu is quite limited. I ordered the burger mainly because I couldn't find anything else I really wanted... except the salmon, but at $18 it seemed quite overpriced.

The place has a \"cool\" vibe and some interesting items in the small market area. Due to the large warehouse design, it was noisy. I will definitely return for the Farm Cup and hopefully catch some interesting daily special items."}
{"text":"I came here solely for the chile verde pot pie and they ran out.

It's fine, I'm flexible... Although I was bummed because on our 3 day trip to Phoenix, I only had a limited number of eating opportunities and I saved one just for pot pie. 

We ordered the porchetta sandwich,  a weekend special apparently, and the rice bowl. I had mixed feelings about the sandwich. The pork was very tasty and tender...but the ciabatta bread ruined it for me. Without sauce, there's no reason to use ciabatta. The bread is too tough for a dry sandwich.

The rice bowl was good, healthy and vibrant although overpriced for something you can make yourself. The peanut vinaigrette is really good though.

The food wasn't WOW enough for me to not feel cheated that I didn't go to one of my other bookmarked options"}
{"text":"It's not that this place is bad, it has a charm that comes with the cool outdoor patio dining area and the open structure with it's hip staff, but the food is meh. 
Good coffee (Cartel) and dog friendly.

I've dined here only twice, so maybe I'm missing something. 

Chorizo Burrito - pretty darn good.
Egg & Bacon Sandwich with Avocado - not bad but the bacon was slimy and hardly cooked at all.
Potatoes - these were steamed and flavorless.
Lox Bagel - Good but $15 really?

This place is pretty good for brunching with some mimosas at the bar with the bartender dressed like Edward Sharpe. Come chill and kick it with your amigos on the patio and enjoy your drinks during the cool Arizona winter, but don't be expecting to be blown away by the food."}
{"text":"THANK YOU to all the Yelp users that rated this place so high. I tried it and was not disappointed! Amazing local place and beautiful weather sitting outside to boot!! (I live in DC) 

Being from St. Louis, I take BBQ seriously. I'm happy to say, Public Market cane through in fine style. Thanks to our server, Sid, for such hospitality! And thanks to the cook staff for a wonderful treat. :-)

Happy, happy tummy!!"}
{"text":"I've never been to this place and had good service. During the day, you order at the counter and seat yourself, which I don't mind. But I always have to wait WAY too long, and often don't get what I happened to order (this happened today, when I ordered a large latte, got a regular, which is tiny BTW, and when I asked about it I was made to feel like I had made the mistake, instead of someone just offering to fix it). During the evening, you are waited on, but both times I've been here for dinner, it has been nearly impossible to get food, drink, and bill in a timely manner. 

My other gripe is that the food is overpriced. I like some of the food (the pretzel appetizer is awesome), but most of it is smaller than you'd expect (e.g., the asian chicken salad) and definitely more than you'd like to pay for it. 

It's too bad, because it's near my house and I love the concept and decor. Alas, for coffee I love Lola and Giant about 1,000 times more, and there is obviously better food nearby."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this cafe, but I thought my food was just okay. I ordered the \"Eat the Rainbow\" salad, which is described as marinated, steamed, and raw veggies with dipping sauces. I expected a more cohesive salad, but it was more like a plate of crudites than a salad. Best part of the dish was the curry aioli. Definitely not worth $9.

However, my friend got the Evans-Churchill, and it looked amazing! Some of the other dishes looked really appetizing as well, so maybe I just tried the wrong thing. 

It can get crowded on a weekday lunch, but they bring the food out fast and people don't loiter too long."}
{"text":"Good crowd, good beer, good food. I had the meatloaf and my friend had the pimento cream sauce pasta, which was pretty spicy."}
{"text":"Really good food great atmosphere great view of the streets of Central and light rail always a big crowd lots of servers for help and just an all-around great place to have brunch."}
{"text":"CONS
waitress forgot the order. 
Barrista made 2 wrong drinks.
New drinks arrived (1 of 2 still wrong).
Waitress busy hugging boyfriend. 
Finished and waited and waited while 3 staff members played on their phones (maybe better for business and conduct to have NO phone rule..?).

The southwestern pasta was good, personally didn't think 13 dollars good (minimum chicken).

Interior is very nice, music too loud.
Disappointed, was excited to come here."}
{"text":"Good food (pulled pork sandwich, a little sweet, not spicy.. French fries, just like homemade). Great drink (Live and Let Bee), YUM! Desserts."}
{"text":"Amazing. I can't believe how great it is to have a place like this in Phoenix. I love how they source as many vegetables as they can from the local farmers in the area. I love how friendly and knowledgable the staff is. I also love the diversity in this place! Today I met a very talented artist who is married to an incredible architect and they were just sitting right next to me. You never know who you'll meet there! Love this place, seriously! The food, the drinks and the service is amazing! Long Live PPM!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, great atmosphere, in a wonderful location downtown. The breakfast dishes they create are some of the best in the city. I know this place has desires to bring people together and create community, and I believe they are doing this. You have to try The Devil's Mess."}
{"text":"So much yes to this place! I love it here. It's not the best place if you're looking for a whole bunch of variety, but everything they do they execute so perfectly. From coffee to cocktails to delicious num nums, this place has it all at a price point you really can't argue with. It's a great place to go for dinner, a low-key reading session, or for a quick iced tea after perusing the Saturday Farmer's Market. My only wish is that they had more vegetarian options, but I'm sure that's on the horizon.

I recommend the veggie rice bowl. Offer to be upcharged for extra veggies. You won't regret it! The black bean soup is also delicious. The Flarney Garney is a serious commitment to napping later."}
{"text":"We had planned on enjoying breakfast elsewhere on Easter Sunday, but we ended up here in a time crunch on the way to PHX. 
I am so glad we did. It's your basic farm to table place. Normal food with a twist (like chickpea pancakes), and your basic breakfast stuff! 
Oh, this place is home to the most AMAZING potato EVER! As someone who loves potatoes...
To top it off... Excellent customer service!!"}
{"text":"I love that they offer a Sun Devils discount here! I usually go grab macaroons in between classes. Sometimes they are old and hard, which is a big bummer considering the price. This place is kind of pricey but I mean for what they offered's worth it. But I really wish they wouldn't sell old macaroons for that same price."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast one morning while in Phoenix for vacation.  Great service and great food.  This is a great stop in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Pork chile verde pot pie and baked sweet potato (served with chile lime butter)...5 Stars

The Chino salad (cabbage, cashews, chicken, rice noodles, ginger soy vinaigrette)...4 Stars (Yummy but vinaigrette could have been a skosh-bit sweeter)

Check-in on the handy-dandy YELP app and get rewarded with a yummy macaron cookie?? 6 Stars....(so it balances to 5). We got a lavender (color, not flavor) macaron. It was exquisitely tasty.

We arrived here after walking around downtown, catching a movie and a 10 minute debate over where to have dinner, since one of us was famished and the other...peckish. 

Off in the near distance we see a bright red sign beckoning us to come hither...the sign read (NO! not literally, that would be impressive, but we will probably never fully know or comprehend the literacy of the sign) \"CAFE\". 

Alas, this is no mere cafe. This is a place where delicious things happen."}
{"text":"I love this plane for the food and drink. The Internet is pretty bad though. Fortunately I rarely come here for the Internet."}
{"text":"The house made pretzel and cheese sauce was perfect. The right amount of crust and chew and the cheese sauce was a béchamel which was perfect! The fried chicken skin was seasoned perfectly and fried to the perfect crispness. The kale salad and mashed taters(super creamy) were great additions. The rotisserie chicken and root veggies were also amazing! The butter with chiles with the yam was yummy! We will be back for sure! Service was spot on!"}
{"text":"They serve the best cinnamon roll I've ever had in my life!
Atmosphere is nice and love all the local food selection! I've especially enjoyed every veggie dish that I've ordered here. And I love that they serve cartel coffee! Some of the best in the valley!"}
{"text":"Rustic little place in downtown Phoenix. It may not look great outside but you'll love everything inside. I got an energy rice bowl and I had all the energy in the world to walk up and down downtown. Very healthy too! I liked sweet potatoes with lime butter."}
{"text":"I am completely satisfied! My lunch was so delicious! I love the healthy eating options! The 1/2 chicken was so good! Seasoned and cooked so well! The sides (sweet potato and brussels) were Wonderful. I love when food is made so well that even when you are making healthy choices, you are just as fulfilled. Also, what made me go 5 stars was the service. The small mistake on my order was handled so well! The kindness was very appreciated! I used the check in for a corn cookie, I only had a taste, but it was great!! I am jealous of my kids who get to finish it!"}
{"text":"After craving a late breakfast, I sat at the bar and ordered the Rooster Booster. This meal consists of 2 eggs any style, bacon, toast, and potatoes. I inquired if I could alter this by subbing chorizo instead of bacon and replacing the toast with their farm vegetables, which was braised turnips and Swiss chard that day. The bartender was very nice and said it should be no problem at all. My plate arrived not long after and it was overflowing with foodporn. Even the guy who brought it to me from the kitchen said, \"Here you go, that looks *really* good!\" And let me say, this meal was EXACTLY what I was looking for. I fully regret not taking a picture of the beautiful and colorful bounty. I crave vegetables (morning, noon, and night) and breakfasts often fall extremely short of them. The turnips and chard were unbelievably good and tied everything together wonderfully.

I pleasantly surprised when receiving the bill to discover that I was not charged for adding farm vegetables. Super score!

If you are looking for organic, local food in a relaxed and comfortable environment, look no further and support this terrific cafe!!"}
{"text":"First time a guest and I went to PPMC, we ordered from the counter and sat at the bar. We were immediately scolded for ordering at the counter and taking a seat at the bar. Apparently, one must be seated at the bar to order if you are to be seated there.

So I went back solo today....sat at the bar. I chose one of only a few seats available. There were some used plates and glasses on the bar at my place that the previous patron had just left. I asked the bartender if it was OK that I sat there. He assured me that he would clear the plates/glasses and get me started. 10 minutes later, nothing...no eye contact, no clearing of the old crap and no acknowledgement that I was there. Subsequently, I left. Ordering nothing and having no professional service.

This place is cool....the ambiance is great...but honestly, the service SUCKS. There are many places I could chose from in that vicinity that has stellar service AND food/drinks. So I chose to go to one of those instead.

It is a shame that a bartender cannot multi-task and an establishment is void of customer service.

Come on PPMC....get it together! I don't think I will come back. Lux, Rumbar. and a host of other establishments puts short pants on your service. You may \"look\" good, but if cannot deliver, I'm out.

I will say that the brandy spiked sangria (which we had during our first visit) is extraordinary. Try it.....unfortunately, I'll go down the street to Carly's for their own version and get some proper service."}
{"text":"Nice bowl of oats for breakfast. $7.25 seems a bit pricey for oatmeal, but really like the hint of vanilla and sprinkling of seeds and nuts."}
{"text":"Really fantastic place. Service could use improvement thus the lack of one star.

I don't understand anyone's desire to get breakfast anywhere else. Why spend $ on a national chain when you can get bacon eggs and toast here for under $7 WHILE supporting a local business. Delicious coffee too."}
{"text":"Great place!
Went here with a group of friends. A bit loud during the morning but the food and decor was great. Love that it was all locally grown."}
{"text":"Nice, hipster, downtown ambiance :) I had a burger and beer at the bar and I would definitely come back for that!"}
{"text":"I could eat here every day and never get tired of this place. They have so many tasty options. My favorite lunch/dinner dish here is the rotisserie chicken. I love their Sweet Potatoes (ask for the topping on the side as it is an over generous portion)  and their vegetable of the day. Their breakfasts are very good as well. The oatmeal is usually my pick. They usually have some great deserts as well as wonderful coffee."}
{"text":"Meh. I wasn't totally impressed. My friend and I ordered a 1/2 rotisserie chicken to share. When it came I asked the waitress if this was the 1/2 chicken because it was sooo small. I said it is like a 1/4 chicken and my friends said no, it's less than that. 

I do have to say that the veggie rice bowl one of my friends ordered was really good. The ginger sauce was amazing.

Everyone complained that they weren't given enough food, especially for the cost."}
{"text":"My favorite version of the \"public market\" chain!! They always make the food to perfection, always are not super busy, and have great available parking!!

I definitely prefer the dinner menu then the lunch menu, the lunch menu is not too impressive after a few visits. 

I also LOVE the fact you can bring in your own water, it saves a lot!

My favorite dish is definitely the southwestern chicken pasta!"}
{"text":"Met up with a friend at Phoenix Public Market for happy hour during the week, and have to say they have a nice selection of food available on their happy hour menu.

I had been craving nachos for days, so of course I went with the King Dave' Nachos, its layers of tortilla chips, cheese, black beans and fresh sliced jalapenos topped with creama and guacamole. It was just what I was craving. 

To share was an order of devil fries, let me tell you, these guys are the bomb! Its French fries with peguin chili, garlic, parsley and parmesan. These guys have a kick to them and make it impossible to stop eating, and it also comes with some side sauces for dipping, but to honest I don't remember the sauces because the fries were great on their own.

I've been to the Phoenix Public Market for breakfast a few times; now I am glad to have tried it for happy hour too! Don't forget to check in on Yelp, you might score yourself a free cookie!"}
{"text":"Came here for a brunch and it was absolutely fantastic. The food was really good. The place is pretty packed but you can still find a table. Parking is pretty packed but I still found something. Would definitely be a good meeting place for brunch lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"So yummy.  We took the family on a Saturday night, the energy and the food were great for the whole family.  The flavors were spot on, I wanted one of everything on the menu."}
{"text":"This is becoming one of my favorite spots to hang out in downtown Phoenix. Firstly, all of the workers here are friendly. Secondly, the food is great (My favorites are the AZ burger, Chicken salad sandwich, or the pulled pork sandwich). Thirdly, they have one of the best happy hours in town. 3pm-close you can get half priced cocktails, wine, and for 5 dollars you can get a pitcher of beer, which is perfect for hanging out with a friend. Their selection isn't incredible, but everything they have is good.

Do yourself a favor and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Phoenix Public Market has some of the best brunch out there. The food is delicious and fresh, and the Bloody Marys aren't bad either.  It does get a little crowded, dogs are allowed, and it attracts a younger crowd. If you're in the area looking for something delicious, definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Sweet environment love this place, can't go wrong every time you want to enjoy cool people, fun food and helpful service. Thanks for everything"}
{"text":"Disappointed with their shrinking portion sizes. You'll get less than you would last year with the Chino and rice bowl too. Tastes good though"}
{"text":"This place was great!! It's a really nice setup inside with table seating, a bar, or outside patio seats. I sat at the bar and had a really good chicken salad sandwich. It had a fun vibe with friendly service."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with lots of fresh foods! Price is about $12/person depending on the entree and drink chosen! Cartel coffee served here!"}
{"text":"This is a nice welcome change to the choices of restaurants for the Downtown Phoenix ASU campus.  

I've been quite a few times during busy times during lunch and off times such as 2/3 pm.  

I've had the bagel sandwich, Del Rio, a couple of salads, and the rice bowl.  All have been pretty good.  The Del Rio sandwich sometimes has lacked all the ingredients listed on the menu.  The bagel sandwich (one bagel with hummus and the other with guacamole) is huge.  It is not good leftover though.  The rice bowl has an interesting taste and is pretty filling.   I've ordered side vegetables which are tasty.  

The baked goods have been hit or miss. The dark chocolate cookie looked good but had no flavor whatsoever.  The carrot cake cookie sandwich was very good though. 

The service is sometimes good, sometimes really rude.  The cashiers are sometimes rude.  Sometimes they are nice.  The last few times I went, the cashiers act like I'm annoying them by just being there and ordering food.  Almost every time I've been, something has been left off my order. The last time something was missing, the guy brought it and just slammed it down on the table. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great cafe, fresh food, and nice ambience! You order at the counter, grab a number, and find an empty table. They'll bring your food to you. 

I ordered the Evans Churchill which is quinoa with roasted veggies and two poached eggs on top. Everything was so good- the quinoa was perfectly cooked, the veggies were really fresh and nicely roasted, and the eggs were perfectly poached. It was served with pesto. It was a little under seasoned so had to put some salt and pepper on it, but overall loved the freshness of the dish.

I bought some cookies to go, the corn cookie and chocolate chip cookie, and a nutter butter. The corn cookie and chocolate chip cookie were both really good.

Next time, I want to try the Flarney Garney breakfast sandwich (my friend's favorite he said). My friend's chicken salad sandwich looked really good- perfectly toasted bread with a thick slice of watermelon served on the side."}
{"text":"I was downtown today to check out the open air market with my boyfriend and we decided to grab brunch at the attached cafe. It was very crowded and very loud, but being prime brunch hour on a Saturday that wasn't much of a surprise. We were expecting to have to wait around awhile given the number of people but our food came surprisingly quickly (I'd say it was less than 10 minutes). I ordered the blue corn pancake and it was delicious! I was a little apprehensive about the combo but decided to be adventurous and I'm glad I did. It was a little pricey ($10 something I think) but very substantial - I couldn't even finish it. I also got an iced mocha latte which was fabulous. My boyfriend got some sort of biscuit and gravy plate and he loved it. We will definitely be back (I wanna try out some of those delicious looking baked goods they had on display)!"}
{"text":"I stopped in and planned to have dinner here. Decided to start with dessert and ordered a homemade pop tart. I had to ask for a plate and the girl wiped my plate dry with the towel she had at the counter. What else did that towel wipe? So I just used the paper wrapping as my plate. I ate like 1/4, if that. It crumbled into lots of pieces every time I tried to cut a small piece. Ended up with a big mess. And, I just thought it was weird it wasn't served warm. I decided to look for something else after that. It was a meh experience for my very short visit. Just my two cents."}
{"text":"First time in Phoenix -stopped in for Sunday lunch had the bakers quiche and side of toast and jam -cut up my garnish watermelon slice on top of side salad -all were excellent ! Will be back before I leave Phoenix"}
{"text":"All I can say is Wow! This is the first time I have ventured into this place and I don't know why it took me so long considering I work not too far from it. I came at brunch time and was all by myself. I don't even remember the name of what I ordered but I would order it again in a heartbeat and I can't wait to take hubby so he can taste it as well! It was a slice of toast (of course on their really yummy bread) smeared with fresh avocado and covered with Nova Lox and then topped with two perfectly poached eggs. The ratio of salmon to avocado to capers was spot on. When I checked in on Yelp I received a free cookie so I made my way up after my meal to pick one out. There were so many different kinds that I couldn't decide on just one and ended up buying another one! Both were delicious and I could see me getting addicted to them! Will definitely make my way here in the near future to try lunch!"}
{"text":"Never fails to please!  Love the service, food and atmosphere!  The chicken pot pie is a fav and so is the Cubano sandwich.   Also , their cocktails are unique and tasty."}
{"text":"To be honest, I just come in for the cookies. But since I'm here, I get lunch too. It's always delicious and I love sitting on the shady patio.
Eat the Rainbow is as great as it sounds.
\"Lemonade of the month\" is Ginger Blueberry. I'm always happy here"}
{"text":"This is a good spot if you are downtown at ASU or in the area. The staff is pleasant and food is pretty good for lunch or breakfast (at a modest price)."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful evening at the Phoenix Public Market. A friend just moved Downtown and recommended this place for dinner. Happy Hour all night? SCORE!!! Although it is just drinks :/ I love appetizers when it comes to Happy Hour but they did have a good selection of drinks and drinks specials during this time. The menu was smaller, in my opinion, and a little but \"off-the-wall\" It definitely not your traditional \"chilli's or TGIF\" menu which I loved although this also presented a challenge for me! Small menu and things I'm not familiar with?!? Challenge accepted!!! I LOVED my The Rachel sandwich! Absolutely something amazing and I keep thinking about wanting to go back for. The turkey is freshly baked and shaved off, daily...soooo moist!!! It also had fresh coleslaw, sauerkraut (which I do not normally order), swiss cheese, and house dressing on a sourdough bread! Omg...what a combo!!! So happy I decided on this! Our server was perfect. Very attentive, understanding when a friend did not like her drink selection and even brought us a whole plate full of their pastries for desert since we had mentioned the Yelp check-in! Don't forget!!! You get a free cookie :) Hands down, I recommend the place. I give it a 4, only because it's not a full menu of things that are on my fav's list! Overall, VERY good!!! I'll be back hopefully sooner than later!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place but at this point I can't even like it.  I walk in and sit at the bar.  The bartender wipes off the menu and puts in front of me.  He brings me a glass of warm red wine.  I never see him again. I wanted dinner. There's four people at the bar.  I wait.  Nothing.  I chug my wine leave the exact amount of the wine and zero tip.  First time in my life. If this had been the first time I had gotten terrible service it would have been one thing, but this was about the 5th time.  Kinda over it.  It gets two stars because if they could improve the service it would be a good place. I left the bartender's tip at Forno 301.  It's a great little Italian place on Roosevelt.  I got my food before I had time to finishing writing this.  Check it out.  And yes I left them extra."}
{"text":"We decided to go here on default because there was a long wait for Matt's Big Breakfast (MBB).  Needless to say, we expected a good breakfast because of rave reviews on yelp.  I wasn't expecting MBB quality, but I was expecting good quality.  I got the Rooster Booster, green tea, and a raspberry lemon bar.  The place is quite big and you walk up, place your order, a number is given to you and you sit and wait for the food.  The patio is nice, but we went on a rainy day so it was not so nice (obviously).  Our food took forever to get to us (at least 20 minutes).  Overeasy eggs, bacon, toast, potatoes...How long could it really take to make?  We had to get up and ask the cashier up front which we found out was at the front waiting to get picked up by someone to bring to us.  

So, the food was ok but it wasn't spectacular.  The green tea was not good.  The raspberry lemon bar was really good.  The place is definitely a cute one especially if you want to go there to read a book or study.  I definitely don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"The superfood salads was one of the greatest salads of my life. Kale, roasted sweet potato, broccoli, and the perfect light & refreshing apple cider vinaigrette. Loved the selection of iced teas & beverages as well as the outdoor patio. Didn't try the cookies everyone raves about, but they look delicious!"}
{"text":"The best chocolate chip cookies I have ever had in my life! Breakfast was tasty too, bacon and eggs were cooked perfectly. None of the employees were very friendly but we went early on a Tuesday morning so maybe they were waking up? Excited to try lunch there next! With a chocolate chip cookie for dessert of course!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the design of the place was really cool. The food was great and the 20% student discount was amazing. Definitely coming back again soon."}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable pricing. Extremely friendly staff. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nice, casual lunch spot w/ great cocktails! I had the chicken salad sandwich and the Yelp checkin cookie for dessert (Loved the cowgirl cookie!) Perfect for my first stop after checking into the hotel."}
{"text":"Wonderful building and atmosphere. The service was friendly however I don't think I recd the student discount although I asked. I did not get a receipt, so could not be certain. Today the drink counter was disgusting and the floors were messy. Need some kind of back up for rush hour to ensure the experience is consistent whether busy or not. Ran out of ice too!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this gem when I was walking to my car from Matt's big breakfast! I took a second to stop by and check things out. Very cool setup inside. Bar Ardenato the right. Large sitting area to the left. Down the middle is the line to order area with side tables that offer house items to purchase. The menu is extensive! Good breakfast options and lunch items. I definitely recommend the AZ Burger with fries! There fries are SO Good!!!! Great setup with excellent service!!"}
{"text":"Great spot to get lunch, coffee, snacks, or drinks downtown. This place has a really cool vibe and great food. You order at the counter, then grab a seat and wait for your food. There are lots of tables inside, and a few tables outside as well. There's also a bar for coffee and drinks. 

I've had the Del Real sandwich a couple times, and it ranks high on my list of veggie sandwiches! Roasted peppers, avocado, greens, goat cheese spread, and carmelized onions between crispy whole grain bread = deliciousness. I also enjoyed the prickly pear iced tea and a corn cookie. Not sure what I was expecting from the cookie, but I'd go with another flavor next time!"}
{"text":"I like the vibe . it has that market feel. I had a green chili burger and it was worth the 12 bucks I shelled out. I would recommend this to bring your parents or a artsy side chick."}
{"text":"Friendly, high-volume, casual dining. The sandwiches, fries, pasta and quesadilla all got good reviews; the desert selection was limited, but had an appealing freshly home-made quality; the service was efficient and friendly--and most important on a typically hot Phoenix summer day, the beverages were all cold and the beer cheap!"}
{"text":"I stopped here a month ago looking for  another restaurant so i didn't stay to eat. Until today. The atmosphere and the smell from the wood fired grill is intoxicating. My guest ordered the Rice Bowl w Salmon. It was truly a great dish. The Salmon had that wood fired grill flavor. It was awesome. I ordered the Tito's Cuban w French fries.  I had high hope for, but was let down . The Cuban was not pressed down while cooking, there was a cosher dill pickle the size of a toothpick and they used stone ground mustard instead of the conventional yellow. Then must of my small bowl of French Fries where little prices the size of a pea. They did redeam them selves by making the best Cowgirl cookie we've ever eaten. I would come again if in the area to try other items on there menu."}
{"text":"Update: this place has really figured out its groove. Been here two more times and service was fast and as usual the food fresh and delicious! 

Great breakfast vibe. Chill, yet chaotic. Get there early on Sunday and there's no wait. It's much busier during downtown Phoenix public market."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go when I'm in Phoenix! Incredible food that's really fresh (love the Kale Salad) and fast. There's free wifi and great outdoor seating (including a fireplace). Their juice, coffee (Cartel), and alcoholic drinks all so good, too."}
{"text":"This place is cute. Came here around 2PM on a Saturday and there were plenty of seating options inside/out, and no wait whatsoever. 

Decor was simple and casual - exactly what you'd imagine from a farmers' market. Not sure why this excited me so, but they have carafes and glasses for all your still/sparkling water needs. For a thirsty thirsty person, I guess that'd save you a trip or so.

I was undecided between the Flanched Flarney Garney (scrambled egg sandwich w/ chunky avocado, mayo, bacon, and cheddar cheese) and Tito's Cubano. I ended up going with the Flarney Garney per the cashier's recommendation (and who wouldn't with such a fun name!?). It was pretty good! I wouldn't say it was the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had, but it was definitely tasty and very filling! 
The grapes/oranges that came on the side were SO fresh and delicious - the perfect touch after a fairly heavy sandwich. I also tried some of my friend's fries, but these were a tad lackluster for me. 
Oh, and with your free Yelp check-in, you get a cookie! I got the ballerina cookie and really enjoyed it. I'd recommend it if you like a nutty cookie that's not overbearingly sweet.

Overall, I like that this is right by the public market. It really reminds you just how fresh your food is, and that it's locally sourced! It's great if you're looking for some fresh, simple, and reliable sandwiches in a cute casual environment!"}
{"text":"Friend found a gem or a keeper as long as they continue to put out delicious food as they did last night. Picked from their $12.95 menu. You start with a garden fresh green salad, (NO ICEBERG LETTUCE)
Choices for main were fried chicken, meatloaf and for vegans roasted cauliflower. Fried chicken was excellent and served with delicious mashed potatoes and red cabbage slaw. When you finish with your main meal, then comes dessert. Chocolate mousse with expresso whipped cream was the chef choice for our meal. No need to write anymore."}
{"text":"In late September, my boyfriend & I went to Phoneix for the weekend (we're from Chicago). After we landed & got our rental car, we were looking for a place to have lunch. We were driving up to the Grand Canyon, so we wanted something fast, but filling.

We spotted Public Market Cafe & decided to head it. I absolutely loved it! It was so trendy & reminded me of the West Loop in Chicago (it's an up-and-coming trendy/hipster area that I adore). The decor & vibe was just incredible.

I'm a dairy-free vegetarian, so sometimes finding something other than salad can be hard, luckily Public Market Cafe had tons of options to choose from! I settled on the AB&J with a honey almondmilk latte.

I'm a travel blogger, so when I find places like this, I get so happy. Rarely do you find a place that's healthy, locally sourced, & delicious all in one.

If you want to read more about our stop at Public Market Cafe (or our trip in general), you can read about it in my blog post!

{"text":"Good atmosphere, clean place, and quality food.    

I tried the cubano and the wife got the bbq pulled  pork.    The cubano had good flavor.   The BBQ pulled pork I don't think was really BBQ, it tasted more like it was baked and to be honest, lacked a little kick that real BBQ gives. 

The place is immaculate and has the feel of a really well run restaurant.   The food is good too!   You can't really go wrong here.   Give it a try!"}
{"text":"The service was just ok.... I stood at the entrance at the wait to be seated sign but no one ever came to seat me, so I walked to the counter in the back that has all the baked goods. I made it with three minutes to spare before happy hour was over. I ordered a pulled pork Sammy, haven't eaten it yet.... Got it to go for my airplane ride. But I did order a pork verde pot pie that was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, laid back spot. This is my go to restaurant downtown whether I want a iced toddy, yummy breakfast, or a kickass happy hour.  My favorite menu item is the breakfast frittata and potatoes. It is topped with pesto, and loaded with red peppers, broccoli, onions, basil, and arugula.  For happy hour my favorite is still the pretzels with beer cheese. Amazzzing! Lol"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!   The staff was so kind and friendly. We orders the Cuban Sandwich* and the pulled pork sandwich, let me tell you both were perfection and didn't disappoint the tastebuds.  The pulled pork was moist, delicious and had the perfect amount of BBQ sauce and slaw.  My husbands Cuban sandwich was tasty and not overpowering with cheese:)  needless to say I'm glad we made the stop  heading they AZ on our road trip because every bite was worth it!  The little pasty/ dessert case is adorable and so tasty.  We tried the cashew chocolate chip cookie* (don't quote the name)  it was so delicious and the little hint of salt on a chewy cookie was perfection!   Can't wait to go back on our next drive out."}
{"text":"The traditional breakfast was good.  Whole potatoes are a nice touch.

The fruit in my yogurt, granola, fruit dish was not that fresh.  It was boring, heavy on cantaloupe, with just a smidge of unflavored yogurt.  Definitely would not recommend.

Quiche -- super small portion and flavorless.

I don't know, just seemed like there should be fresh lemons at the water station.  Any student ID should receive a discount, not just ASU."}
{"text":"Not only am I impressed with the food and location, I'm impressed with the employees.  And no, I'm not personal friends with any of them.  :)  I have been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and had great experiences every time!  I especially love the salmon. It was amazing.  But what really stood out is the genuine people that work there.  One morning, a handicapped man that appeared to be a regular was talking to an employee.  Although she was busy with the restaurant, she took the time to talk to this man that needed help.  She was very patient and kind despite the hectic restaurant.  Very impressive.  Felt like a legit local restaurant.  I will continue to be back and bring my friends."}
{"text":"Great food. Everything is made fresh from scratch. Love the atmosphere and service. The green Chile cheeseburger is amazing."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! I've been coming here for lunch for about a year now. Really close to ASU campus if your a student, great atmosphere to hangout or study and the food is awesome! I recommend the rice bowl or the rotisserie chicken and the oatmeal cookie. 10/10 recommend!!!"}
{"text":"HOW is this place not busy all the time? The fare here is both original and very good. The atmosphere is very relaxed, and the outdoor seating is exceptionally pleasant on a cool spring afternoon.

I've not been to Phoenix often in recent years, but when I am here I'll be certain to come to the Phoenix Public Market Cafe every time. Count on it."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food, excellent servers, awesome indoor/outdoor architecture. Phoenix Public Market has it going on. Except for one thing.

What is UP with the beer selection? The obsession with high gravity IPA's, Hefe's, or sweet dark beers-- at Phoenix Public Market & elsewhere-- is so tired. In an era & in a neighborhood where there are lots of tap selections like this, why not diversify and have an intelligent, crisp pilsner on line? I'm not talking Bud or Stella (blech...), but something like Polestar, 4 Peaks Poppin Pils, Firestone Pivo (2013 GABF gold medal winner), or one of about a dozen other delicious crafts available? Or, an awesome german pilsner (Spaten? Lowenbrau?).  I find it quite mystifying. Whoever makes the beer selection, pretty please expand the Market's palette & swap out a line or two... make an intelligent selection or two of delicious pilsners and you'll sell TONS more beer, I so guarantee it!  

Thirsty, with my fingers crossed..."}
{"text":"Love this spot downtown! 

I am a HUGE fan of their chicken salad sandwich- it has curry and all kinds of other delish things in which are to die for! Order it, you won't regret it.

They have a good selection of beers on tap, there almost always seems to be a Deschutes beer available which Im keen on being a northwest girl so thumbs up there!

The patio is lovely to sit on and enjoy the az weather. I was there one evening for dinner and they had live music which was just fabulous!

If you show your ASU Id you get a discount on your check. I really hope they start offering discounts for all state universities (Ahem, U of A!) especially since downtown now has UA campus. I would be so pleased as a fellow wildcat :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Phoenix Public Restaurant many times and am always happy with the food. The servers are friendly, but there never seem to be enough on the floor. Good cocktails (a little spendy) and a nice selection of beers make for a good happy hour."}
{"text":"DW and I were just walking around DT from the underwhelming Phoenix Festival of the Arts when we came across this place.  Stopped in for a draft with pretzels and jalapeno cheese sauce.  The sauce was tasty but the pretzels were overdone.  Service was attentive and food selections were different enough to warrant some epicurean exploring on future visits."}
{"text":"Came in for drinks and appetizers. Ceviche and farmer's cup were my fave. I find myself craving this place all the time wish it wasn't a 5 hr drive =("}
{"text":"Cute spot with indoor / outdoor seating. Order at the register and theyl bring you the food kind of thing... Recommend the chicken salad sando."}
{"text":"Im visiting from California and I found this place through yelp. The food is good and the environment is laid back and hipster-ish. They get busy on weekends as most places do. The service is ok, but communication bw kitchen and front needs improvement. My order was delayed 20minutes on my first visit and everyone else got their order. On my 3rd visit my companion's order was late. Other than communication and order delays I still like this place."}
{"text":"Perk: Discount for ASU students who show their ID.
Perk 2: Free sparkling water + lemon = delicious.

Fav eats: Breakfast burrito (not the largest, but definitely the cheapest breakfast option), oatmeal risotto (so! good!), seasonal pumpkin soup (autumn) or Roosevelt Row bagel (lunchy-breakfast.) The coconut curry soup is also really good, and my dad really loves the green chile pot pie.

The atmosphere is pretty sweet. Large tables are great for groups of people or large amounts of homework, small tables for small groups, and a nice outdoor patio with heaters and a fireplace in the winter. 

The bar brews Cartel coffee if you only feel like studying with a cup of coffee, but you will probably get weird stares from servers if you're doing homework there past 6 pm.

The only funky thing is that at 6 pm it goes from a walk-up ordering system to a sit-down ordering system. So if you plan on loitering to drink coffee/munch on things/do homework, plan on leaving before 6."}
{"text":"This place is usually very crowded! The staff seems to work very hard to be quick and efficient, though. I've tried the lentil curry coconut soup, which was lovely! Full of flavor, with just the right amount of spice and sweetness. Also have tried the breakfast burrito and yogurt and granola parfait. Both very tasty, just too much food to consume at once! This is a cute café with a nice patio (for when it's not too hot)!"}
{"text":"The Phoenix Public Market is a unique, cute restaurant right in the middle of downtown Phoenix. I am usually in here around breakfast time, so I end up getting either a pastry or the breakfast burrito. I recommend the pop tarts, they're super good! I also always get a coffee, which they brew beans from Cartel, another local favorite of mine. You order your coffee at the register and it pops up over at the bar, which is unique, but gets me to see the other side of the market as well. My favorite time to come by is when any of the Farmer's Markets are going on outside. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Vegan review: The Market Cafe is a regular lunch and happy hour spot for my coworkers and me. For lunch, I almost always get the Roosevelt Row bagel. It's vegan without any modifications needed. Their bagels are perfect (hard on the outside, soft inside) and the hummus is among some of the best in the Valley. I also love the pickle! 

Other vegan regulars for me include the black beans & rice (minus the cheese); chips, salsa and guac; lentil coconut curry soup; warm pretzels (minus the cheese, add mustard); the AB&J; and the Eat the Rainbow and rice bowls can be modified to be vegan. The fries are also great, and you can get a small side salad that's vegan. They also have a vegan apricot cookie for desert! For happy hour, try the sangria!

My only complaint is that there are no vegan breakfast options (aside from a bagel w/no topping and a fruit bowl. And I can't get the Roosevelt Row bagel for dinner, darn it. It would be nice if there were a few more vegan dinner options, but sometimes I just get fries and a side salad and am good to go.

Service is always great - prompt and friendly, and they've never messed up my vegan options. And the best part? The free sparkling water on tap! Whenever I can't decide where to go for lunch, the thought of the sparkling water makes the decision for me!"}
{"text":"Very lovely cafe. I had the Roosevelt row bagel, some French fries and an iced coffee. All were delicious. The coffee was very good from Cartel. The atmosphere is great and the cafe is decorated very nicely. I would recommended this cafe to anyone."}
{"text":"They have so many options! Everyone loves it. I typically like to go healthy. Their pastries are the best - I love the pop tarts that they make from scratch."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place we had tacos and they were fabulous!  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Well, this is not a \"5\" star like it's sister St. Francis, but really close.  The atmosphere is great.  Long picnic tables with low lighting and you counter order.  The food was ok, just not as mouth watering at St. Francis.  It was also a bummer that kids did not eat for free.  I would also like to see a few more items on the menu.
The s'more cookie we got for free with our Yelp check in was super tasty."}
{"text":"I was really surprised by how good Phoenix Public Market Cafe was.  They had lots of really healthy options, a diverse menu and yummy cookies.  We were looking for a healthy restaurant that wasn't too far from the airport, and this was perfect.  We stopped in, ate some quinoa and were on our way to the airport.  

I had the quinoa bowl, which I first thought might be too boring, but it was very well-flavored.  It came with poached eggs, market veggies and pesto.  This bowl made me wish I knew how to cook and flavor quinoa!  I want their recipe because I normally get bored with quinoa bowls.

My mom had the rice bowl and it was lackluster.  She was jealous of my yummy quinoa bowl because hers wasn't as flavored.  It came with brown rice, market veggies, avocado, mushrooms, sesame seeds, mayo, vinaigrette, cilantro and mint.  Caution, it's serviced chilled.  I normally enjoy my rice hot, so it was a little weird to me.

Cookies: Tip: Check in with Yelp and get a free cookie!  SO yummy!  They had lots of options.  I had the white chocolate chip one with cranberries and it was super yummy!   Pats for the clever cookie names like the Ballerina, etc.

Drinks: They serve wine, beer and cocktails!

Seating and ambiance: It's an open seating area and you order at the counter, and then find your table.  There's lots of light and it's has a nice warm feel.  

Parking: free parking lot with lots of covered parking spots.

Service: Friendly and helpful service.  They answered all our questions, and didn't mind giving me my free cookie even when I forgot to show them my Yelp checkin until after we paid.

Final verdict: Great healthy option with quick service and close to the airport."}
{"text":"I love their pastries! Everyone is very friendly and informative. I like to browse the shelves for goodies in the store!"}
{"text":"To begin, this is a short visit.? I began the experience with a sip of Asom Broso extra anejo. Just the fact that  this $240 a bottle stuff is standard fare gets me excited!
Service was fast, happy and attentive. We had the house special salmon and... don't laugh, a chicken quesadilla.

Who needs to eat with that tequila. Just delicious!"}
{"text":"OMG am here for HH. They have the most amazing pulled pork sandwich. I had them put it on 9 grain bread and it is like little bites of heaven. Great HH price. Decent HH wine. I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Traveling for work and Yelp brought me to this place, I was looking for breakfast and coffee. Breakfast was okay, coffee was AWFUL. I ordered a 16 oz. latte and what I got was bitter burnt coffee :-/"}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre food and lacking service. If you charge me more than $3 for a basic cup of coffee I expect a real cup given to me or brought to my table and not being pointed towards a paper cup by a grunting cashier and self-service, with self-service coffee being empty for 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Overall this place is great. They have a weird concept of all of a sudden switching to seated service at 5pm. It is super annoying because the place works best as an order, pay and thhen sit place. The staff doesn't seem to understand how to handle hosting duties and it would be easiest to just continue the way it is the rest of the day.

They have excellent coffee and I wish they did all day breafast. I'd just avoid it in the evening. Unless you can get a seat at the bar and very service.

They also give the tiniest amount of ketchup possible with fries and potatoes. I know its not ' classy' to have bottles on the table, but it is to have buckets of silverware?"}
{"text":"Sweet potato with jalapeño butter ..... Bomb .. Pull pork pot pie .. Dank ... Farmers market / urban decor lovely ... Yummy ice tea a bonus .. A random place in Phoenix .. Definitely ... Macaroons to finish the meal yup .... Need more to add .. Oh service was amazing ... Done deal.. Def coming back when I go visit Phoenix again !!!"}
{"text":"Everyone is going to be talking about this place soon enough if they are not already. I got the El Diablo Burger at one of the trucks. One of the best burgers I've ever had - BUT... it was slightly undercooked for my liking. Visit now before you have to fight the lines."}
{"text":"Came in had the devil's mess- the salsa makes the dish. The chocolate chip cookie is so good. 

The espresso (2 shots) was alright."}
{"text":"This Place Rocks!!   Great meeting place in downtown.  Fresh food, Clean eating at its best."}
{"text":"Stopped by around mid-morning for a quick bite on our way through town. Ok, I had more than a quick bite. The biscuits and gravy rival The Local in Prescott!  The oatmeal had all kinds of great toppings. Plus, the coffee was very good. Worth driving into downtown for!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great food, and an interesting menu.  I wish there was more seating available though, that is usually the challenge."}
{"text":"I was craving soup today, so a friend told me about this place. I've been here for Food Truck Friday, but never the cafe. I ordered their soup of the day: pumpkin. I liked it! It was topped with sunflower seeds and toasted bread. I also ordered their house pretzels with jalapeno white cheddar cheese, and the pretzels were delicious. Didn't care for the cheese, though. I got a free cookie for checking in with Yelp, which is always a nice perk. Great staff, and lots of other menu items to choose from. I probably will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Everything is fresh. Great environment! Would recommend this place to anyone who's a breakfast fanatic!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, fun vibe.  The farmer's market happens outside on Saturdays so it can get a little busy."}
{"text":"In between visiting the farmer's market and going to a wine tasting event, we knew we should eat something so we stopped in at Phoenix Public Market Cafe.  Such a cute little spot! I absolutely loved the patio and was able to enjoy it while eating lunch.  They have a nice little bar out there as well.  The hubs and I decided to share a meal since we weren't starving.  We went with the Cuban sandwich.  So good! They had many delicious sounding items on the menu so I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"They serve Cartel coffee. Very friendly service, really large space! They had nice comfy benches near the windows with cushions. Got an omelette but it was just okay. Coffee was great."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, AMAZING COOKIES. This YELP offer is seriously the best!"}
{"text":"Yummy yum! Their coconut curry lentil soup is one of my favorite comfort foods. Delicate flavor with a sweet creaminess. For a light meal, add their grilled veggies. Each time you order, their selection is just a little bit different depending on what fresh veggies are in season. 

They also have great coffee drinks and desserts. My only complaint is they don't slice the big cakes. Today's was strawberry brown sugar. It looked Devine! But they only sell by the cake. It's just plain tortuous for us small family people who can't buy a whole cake! Give a girl some love and sell by the slice! Please!!"}
{"text":"Seems the place to be sometimes. People stay way too long, treating it like a Starbucks. But its kind of an old Farm market, nice fresh ingredients, super salads, and of course...BEER. We sat outside, they have great heat blasters so you can sit out there, drink whatever. The kale salad and Chino salad are my faves. I also love their fresh iced teas, no sugar added, amen. Great place to find a quick gift for that tough to please friend of yours-we all have one."}
{"text":"There food is tasty, especially the chorizo, they make it very flavorful! The pastries are super good, you can tell the pop tart is make from scratch!"}
{"text":"Service was nice and quick regardless of the large crowds. I really enjoyed the outside setting area with the chimney. 
I had a yummy blueberry corn pancake."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in last night for a quick bite before a movie. We had about an hour before the movie started. Upon walking in I had a good feeling -- the atmosphere was good, music good. I'd been before for breakfast and didn't have a bad time. 

We sat and waited for our server for what felt like a long time. When she finally arrived, we ordered drinks and sandwiches. She up-sold us on sharing an order of fries. We had told our server upon ordering that we were trying to make a movie. 

Drinks took too long to arrive and that was about the last time we saw our server. Someone else brought out our sandwiches and it seemed to take too long for two simple sandwiches. Our fries didn't arrive with sandwiches. We were halfway through those sandwiches before the fries arrived--they clearly forgot them and gave us fries from another table, causing them to have to wait as well. Original server still never returned and never asked us if we wanted another drink. After eating, server finally returned and we reminded her about the movie and requested the check. Took a bit, but she dropped it off and never returned. We finally went to the counter in the front and asked to pay. We were told only our server could close us out and the girl at the counter had to find our server. More waiting. Finally server appeared, said she hoped she didn't make us miss our movie (so she remembered we were trying to get a movie), but never really apologized for basically going MIA. 

Food was great. Atmosphere was great. Location is great. Service is seriously lacking in both attention and basic professionalism. The problems with service negatively impacted our experience and I'd think twice before stopping here again because of that. We don't need to spend money to be ignored--there are lots of places who have their service down. I really want to like this place and I'll probably give it another shot at some point, but I think the Phoenix Public Market Cafe needs to realize it's not enough to be hip and cool, if you treat the customers like an afterthought no one will want to come back.

We made it to the movie, but just barely in time."}
{"text":"Beautiful space, but the experience--particularly the service--was a letdown for this St. Francis fan. Service on the Tuesday we visited with a party of 6 was painfully slow despite a quiet dinner crowd. Our server repeatedly pointed out that he didn't know much about the menu because he usually works at St. Francis. He was pleasant but distracted, forgetful, and uninformative. They were out of pot pies even though the place was virtually empty and \"the computer said\" they had two left according to our server. The prime rib special was cooked perfectly, but under-seasoned. Might try again for a weekday lunch, since that's when this place should really shine, but I'll stick with St. Francis for dinner."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. Casual yet classy and one that speaks eloquently to the neighborhood. The patio bar is very very nice (when they don't have the supersonic air wall blasting) and they allow dogs! 

For my dime, Cibo and this place are two of downtown's quintessential restaurants."}
{"text":"This is a fun, cool spot. The people who work here are friendly and competent. 

The reason for the 3 stars is the menu. It's awesome that they have vegan and vegetarian items clearly marked (makes things easier for customers and staff). But they don't have many options for vegans, especially if you like to eat. I would expect more creative options from a place like this. They have a bagel with hummus and a salad (both are good - love the dill in the salad), but they don't serve the vegan bagel option or salads before 11. The only vegan option for breakfast is a bowl of fruit - always fresh and delicious, but way too light. 

They serve Cartel coffee, which is very strong and they don't have decaf for espresso drinks, but they do have soy milk."}
{"text":"Really loved our visit to Phoenix Public Market Cafe!  We came for breakfast and ordered the rooster booster and breakfast sandwich. Both were great and the portions were very satisfying.  The best part was the service!  From ordering our meal to sitting at the bar to eat, every staff person was a delight.  They were helpful, attentive and were just genuinely cool people!  If you're ever in downtown Phoenix, I highly recommend you eat here!!!  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. What a cool find. Too bad about the loooong wait for food.

We heard they were dog friendly so we had lunch here on New Years Day after going to the dog park downtown. 

We placed a food order and we were warned that the wait for food was around 30 minutes. Which was fine by us. We picked up a pastry to hold us over and I ordered a bloody mary. Ordering a cocktail can be kind of confusing. You can either go to the bar separately to order one, or order one at the food counter like I did. But then I had to go to the bar and tell the bartender that I ordered a bloody mary, and give him my table number. I guess they go by the honors system. 

The self seating system can be a little chaotic, and you may have to wait around for people to leave. Many people park themselves at a table and stay for what seems like hours. The patio is dog friendly and the staff is very accommodating with dogs, but be warned that it is a little cramped and may not be suitable for larger breeds.

We polished off our decadent chocolate filled croissant. It was perfect. My bloody mary was awesome too, brimming with garden goodness. My only complaint is they are damn expensive. $9. Kind of ridiculous for a mid day cocktail.

The 30 minute wait turned into a 45 minute wait. The staff apologized profusely for the delay. I guess the kitchen got slammed unexpectedly. Luckily we had the day off and no where else to go, so we didn't mind too much.

My hubby and I both had the egg sandwich, but mine without bacon. It was scrumptious. Every ingredient was top notch. My only complaint about the sandwich is that on the menu it said it has avocado when actually it is guacamole. The problem with this guacamole is that it was full of raw onion. I DESPISE raw onion. If I would have know I would have skipped the guac. May sound finicky but I scraped off every piece of onion off the sandwich before I ate it. 

We also shared a side of breakfast potatoes which were cooked perfectly. Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Yum.

The staff is helpful, warm, and a lot of fun. Even with the raw onion issue, the expensive bloody mary, and the long wait for food, the exceptional service and yummy food made up for the shortcomings. We look forward to our next visit and can't wait to sample the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile, so when my boyfriend and I stopped here for a late breakfast on New Years I was happy. Some general thoughts:

- You order at the counter, they issue you a number, and then you wait. The cafe was busy with dine-in and to-go orders so we waited about 20 minutes for our food. 

- Coffee was good. I had the drip with a little sugar while my boyfriend had a latte of sorts. We both liked our drinks. 

- We waited about 15-20 minutes for a table to open up (or even just a corner of a table). Most people were loitering; they obviously finished their food well before we arrived and were just hanging out, watching us and some other folks lurk around for a table. That was rude. 

- Once some tables opened up, we ended up sharing one of the larger ones with a couple of ASU guys. I thought the communal tables were going to be awkward but there was just enough room between us that it wasn't.

- I ordered a frittata with arugula and pesto. It was massive and probably met my protein intake for the day. I ate it all though :)

- The guys next to us both had a rice bowl. It looked really good and I may order that next time."}
{"text":"We forgot we were sitting in the middle of the desert while eating here...could have been in any US major urban area.  We were a bit older than the hipsters and small groups conducting biz over grub.  Family friendly place, as well.  Grab a menu upon arrival, then place your order at the counter & get a number and find a place to sit.  We enjoyed our bfast selections:  the quiche & egg burrito.  Check in before arriving for a delish cookie.  Outdoor patio with misters.  Large bar.  Plenty of indoor seating.  Fast & friendly service."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Great atmosphere. Staff looked pretentious but actually surprised this Texan with some good ole' fashioned hospitality. I think Arizona is my second favorite state now :-)"}
{"text":"Ate there a year ago with a friend as we were in the area. The setting is creative and open, the food is okay but not spectacular, and it's not expensive. Health related food is the specialty. It's one of those trendy places downtown."}
{"text":"I only had delivery, so I can't say much about their service nor restaurant vibe, but I really enjoyed their food! 
I ordered the roasted cauliflower, which was literally an entire head of roasted cauliflower. It was awesome. Usually restaurants give you tiny pieces of the flower, which are too small for me to appreciate. This cauliflower was huge and I could cut it to my liking and fully enjoy the roasted flavor. The garlic mashed potatoes were also tasty and smooth! I wasn't a huge fan of their salad, their dressing was a little too sour, but I also wasn't too hungry after the other two items of the meal. 

I would definitely return here to try one of their sandwiches, or for another cauliflower. I also had their cowgirl cookie which was YUMMY! (and free cookie with Yelp Checkin!!)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here. The Del Real sandwich was even better than I thought. It looked like there was a lot of good things on the menu which made it hard to decide. Everyone that worked there seemed super friendly and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner for my bachelorette party and the food was great! I had the cubano and will be coming back again for it. We had a large party and one weird thing was the waiter told my friend to hand out the separate bills to everyone... like she worked there. I'm thinking the waiter should know how to pass out checks but other than that the food and drinks were good and it had a calm, inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great, wholesome food in a great place! Located in an adaptively reused building in downtown, Phoenix Public Market is a good stop for any meal. There is seating inside and outside, good coffee and a well-stocked bar. I love the breakfasts here, especially the Flanched Flarney Garney egg, avocado and bacon sandwich."}
{"text":"I don't know how I haven't reviewed Phoenix Public Market Café before since we absolutely LOVE this hip little restaurant! Over the years we have tried almost everything on the menu and have narrowed down our favorites, but you truly could order anything and be perfectly satisfied with your meal! Portions are large and the food is flavorful!

Our meal tonight included some of our favorites:
The Fried Chicken - ALL TIME FAVE
Prime Tri Tip - I swapped the mashed potatoes for the baked sweet potato and OH MAN that chili lime butter!!! It elevated the potato and I will definitely order it again 
Italian Porchetta - Full of spice and a HUGE portion
Pot Pie - My dad's absolute favorite item on the menu! Flaky crust, flavor-packed filling that's not too soupy

Don't forget to Check In on Yelp to get a free cookie! I LOVE the Ballerina Cookie, it's full of chocolate and cashews and coconut! The Vegan Apricot cookie is also delicious and moist, not crumbly at all like many vegan cookies are! ASU students also get 20% off an entree if you show a student ID, so I always try to remember to bring mine so I can take advantage of this deal!"}
{"text":"Public Market is my vote for BEST HAPPY HOUR!!! Bar service in general is very attentive. Even if we choose a table, or drop in last minute with a huge group the staff is always friendly helpful and welcoming. It's a hipster place that's not to good to welcome everyone. :) I 100% recommend the Lee Trevino cocktail to anyone and the Ship to Shore is a ringer for sure. Dominic, the bar manager will make an effort to remember regulars faces which is always an amazing thing to me. No fake people here.  Don't even get me started on the pretzels with beer cheese too. 

The only thing that would make this place even better is a rotating menu... maybe change it up seasonally or add a few weekly specials. The menu gets a little boring after so many visits."}
{"text":"This is within walking distance of my work. I love to eat and drink here. I love that I can get breakfast here for lunch. I love that they sell cartel coffee so I can get a good coffee quickly without going to Starbucks. I love that when I want to spoil someone, I can run by and grab a dozen macaroons to bring home. The place is nice, always smells amazing. I love the rice bowl, the bacon, the chicken curry sandwich. Burgers are great and my husband would eat their fries every day of the week. Sometimes they can be a touch slow, but that's a small complaint."}
{"text":"I love the relaxed, open atmosphere.  I was blown away by their breakfast food.  The chick pea pancakes were amazing. My favorite breakfast item is the Flanched Flarney Garney.  For lunch, a generously sized Del Real sandwich is my pick for a healthy  and tasty meal.  I have to say that I constantly crave the Az Burger every time I've come for dinner.  All their menu items are so fresh and delicious.  I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Cool market/restaurant spot in Phoenix.  Came here on a pub crawl and I was pleased with the stopover there.  They have a full bar, which is great, and a lot of food options.  We had the Chino salad (kinda like a Chinese chicken salad) and it was super tasty!  The one thing that I couldn't get over though was that this place looks and feels a lot like LGO, but I found out they aren't connected in any way shape or form.  Not sure if they used the same interior designer or just ripped off their look and feel, but it was surreal to be there and realize I wasn't in Arcadia.

Other than that oddity, the market is casual, and has great food and drink options, so I plan to come back next time I am in downtown for lunch!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and it was packed! The wait wasn't  that long. I was very hungry but I believe  what I ate was pretty good. 

I don't  remember the name of the Sandwich  we ordered unfortunately. 

Nice. Cute. Cozy. We'll  definitely return."}
{"text":"Very modern looking place. I Like the chicken sandwich I had. The lemonade was perfect. Didn't taste like concentrate as usual. Service was sweet and informative. The girl seemed to know what she was talking about whenever asked about the menu. They were pretty quick at bringing our food out as well. We had arrived just before the lunch rush hour flowed in. Over all...an excellent lunch time experience."}
{"text":"I'm excited anytime something new opens up downtown, especially when it's a local business! Cafe is a great environment (felt almost chic farmhouse) that utilizes the space it's in brilliantly. The service was top notch, and ran surprisingly smooth for having just opened. Our bartender/ barista, Allister was very outgoing, attentive, and helpful. He helped us navigate the menu and also let us know that in the future the menu would be much more expansive! Can't wait to come back for a breakfast!"}
{"text":"(Review for Farmers Market on Sat) It was a good experience, would have given a 5 stars if the prices were a bit more reasonable, overall it was good, some veggie stalls had too long of a line, I am sure they can do some improvements."}
{"text":"5 words-Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie. Amazing!

Went during happy hour-Small pitchers of Beer for 5 bucks (2 pints worth).

Had to wait a couple minutes for water once arriving, which was the only negative.

Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I went here for a private event and I cannot believe the deliciousness that ensued. First and foremost.. the Farmer's Cup. What's that?  It's the most delicious drink ever. Pimms, basil, lime, cucumbers.. oh hell, I don't even remember what's in it.  But it was GOOD.
The drink is both sweet and sour, which for me is excellent.  I'm not a fan of sweet drinks at all. 

We were served a pork rotisserie sandwich served in ciabatta.   Wow.  The aioli was a wonderful final touch.  My favorite dish was the melon gazpacho. I was told it was usually served as a special and not part of the regular menu, so if you see it; don't be skurred, order it!

We were given gift cards to come back and I'm hoping that the gelato sandwich is there. This was served on corn cakes, which seems odd, but it worked!

What I love about this place is the fact that the chef buys his goods next door at the market and figures out the menu accordingly. The menu , even the drinks, are made with fresh local ingredients. You can sincerely taste the difference.

The $5 happy hour specials are fantastic and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm going to be echoing a lot of the previous comments, but it's because they are true! The atmosphere is fun and casual, the service - especially Gabby! -- was very attentive and friendly.

Great deal on 32oz pitchers of beer during an 8 hour long 'happy hour'! Glad I spotted this Cafe on Yelp and had the chance to go, I would recommend it to anyone. And be sure to get dessert!!"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner and had the chopped mediterranean salad and it was not what I was expecting. The salad came with garbanzo beans but it was 70% garbanzo beans on mine. A friend also chose the chopped mediterranean salad and her portion of garbanzo was maybe 20%. I really wanted to send my salad back but was left to eat it after waiting almost 15 minutes for our waiter to make an appearance only to disappear within seconds. He eventually returned 10 minutes later and it was too late.

The restaurant was pretty empty when we were seated which leads me to believe the waiter was watching the NBA finals on tv instead of servicing his tables.

Nice bar and outside area, service need a a little polishing, and food needs a little work as well. Not saying I won't be back but ill give it a year."}
{"text":"Cute place, but a bit pricey-good setup on Saturday mornings next to the farmers market. I had a slice of the banana bread which was good and the world's smallest mocha, which wasn't that good and was $4. I feel better knowing I got a free chocolate chip cookie for checking in on yelp!  I will have to try some food next time I'm near here."}
{"text":"Went and had the house pretzels and green chile potpie Tried the salmon too Perfectly seasoned both of them also one of their signature cocktails, The Lee Trevino was the best Habanero syrup for the win"}
{"text":"Very cool and hip place to hang out before or after class. 
The atmosphere is really relaxing. They have food, bakery, locally beer, coffee, and a little cute stuff to purchase"}
{"text":"It's crazy to think about this place 6 years ago...  Always come here when I'm unsure where to go for lunch. My go to is the frijoles con arroz even though I can easily make this at home for a fraction of the price, that's how bomb.com they are :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Notable items: beet salad with goat cheese, southwest Caesar salad with cornbread croutons and black beans, and the rice bowl with warm  brown rice and fresh veggies/avocado and some amazingly flavorful sauce to pour over. The ambiance is really cozy, with different types of seating options, from the bar to patio to little built in benches to a community table to regular tables. They've got gluten free and vegetarian options as well!"}
{"text":"Good urban food ( pulled pork is really good and so is the az burger), good atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with amazing foods. Some of the best French fries in Arizona. A great place for community and good eats! Also a nice place to do homework."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out and get breakfast or lunch.  Everything I had has been good.  Nice modern industrial decor that fits perfectly with location."}
{"text":"Deliciously Healthy. 

This place is deliciously healthy and very cute. 

Food quality: Fresh and great

Service: Friendly and on point. They took the time to describe different products to me and were knowledgeable. 

Environment: Chillax and clean."}
{"text":"First off, awesome food! The chic pea pancakes are devine. Salads are all very unique. If you live in Downtown or work there deff must stop in  The beer on tap is great always a great selection of IPA's"}
{"text":"This place is booming! No matter the time of day I've never walked in without it being very busy. One of the best Cubanos I've ever had. Black bean soup for me is a fave. To top it off they also sells Cartel coffee. Quick service and never disappoints."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst meal I've had in a while. My frittata came with a complimentary side of grease. The drip coffee was very bad, it did not taste fresh at all. We had ordered a grilled cheese which was stale. All over just a bad experience, I doubt I could stomach giving this place another try."}
{"text":"Noisy, full of uniformed hipsters and boasting expensive, inconsistent food. Met people at 3:00 in the afternoon. The place was empty and the music was deafening. We asked the manager to turn down the volume. He went through the motions but the din continued. Maybe the loud music entertains the staff but I won't go back."}
{"text":"Great customer service and really good healthy food.  Me and my family ate here after a stop at the science center, we walked a few blocks and relaxed and it was a great atmosphere.  My daughter is 3 and she loved the 9 grain grilled cheese.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"There is A LOT going on, but over all good customer service and a great place to have a drink and a snack... if there are a lot of people when you get there, don't expect a full meal to be very good though"}
{"text":"It's a cute cafe with a great location in downtown. Parking can be a bit of a beast depending on what's going on at the Market, but there's always a space to be found if you're patient. It's a welcoming atmosphere and I love the flowers for sale. 

The food is very good. The group I went with all ordered something different and tried each other's items. The pork chili pot pie is the way to go, it's got a good taste and consistency of spice to it. The Flanched Flarney Garney (egg sandwich) was good, but it would be amazing if they would change the bread from a hamburger bun to toast. It was way to bready with the bun, I ended up eating the sandwich sans bun.

Check in with yelp and get a free cookie. I got a s'more cookie. It was absolutely delicious and stole the show for the meal."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!! Ambiance, service and food are all amazing!! I was in town for a convention and ate here everyday. The service staff seemed genuinely happy to be at work and I sensed pride when asking about various food items and what they recommend I order. Each server had the same reactions- everything is sooooo amazing! No lie! And, they were right! Everything was fresh, delicious and had that homemade taste. I even stopped by on my last day to get a to go order for the airport. When they found out it was for the airport they packaged everything special to keep items from getting soggy and even put my dressings in small, tight containers so they would be cleared for TSA 3-1-1 rules on liquids. They definitely didn't want my dressing to not be cleared through security! :) Looking forward to visiting Phoenix again just to eat here. FYI- they also have a full bar and outside seating."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here. Sunday brunch was definitely nice and not too packed around noon. I got the Flanched Flarney Garney egg sandwich. The bun is huge so it was a bit dry, but I would recommend getting a side salsa or something to go with. The chorizo biscuits and gravy is yummy, it reminds me of a warm bowl of chili. Salads are pre-made in the cooler so I wasn't a big fan of that. Dirty chai came from the bar and it was awesome, great taste compared to most places and the bartender was super sweet. They have outdoor seating too. And how could I forget about the homemade cinnamon rolls made from scratch down to the buttercream frosting tower on top of it!!!!!! Can't wait to go back and try some of their rotisserie chicken for lunch."}
{"text":"We go in every Sat morning. My husband and I order the Breakfast burrito, instead of bacon we get chorizo...Yum, Yum, Yum. Also the cashiers and staff are friendly and amazing! - Try the poptarts!!"}
{"text":"I'd post a photo of my cowgirl cookie but I ate it too quickly to capture the beauty that is this cookie...and yes I got it for free for checking in! Not only that, EVERYTHING I had, was fantastic! My friends and I came here and each got something different, so we had a lil sample, the cinnamon roll...delicious... The Devils mess, sit tight taste buds! The biscuits and Chorizo gravy, my heavens! And the breakfast sandwich with a name too silly to repeat, yes please!"}
{"text":"The rice bowl is outstanding! I am not even remotely a vegetarian or vegan however I love this meal every time I come. The restaurant is very hipster yet quaint and cozy which reminds me of home in Alaska. You can definitely taste the freshness and quality of ingredients. The price for the product is very fair. There are so many delicious options which make you want to come back to this restaurant again and again. I can really appreciate the fact that the menu clearly specifies dietary restrictions which is important."}
{"text":"Everything we had here was FABULOUS!
Atmosphere was fun, and everything from the egg sandwich to pretzels were delicious!
A Phoenix MUST!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes! A great collaboration amongst local farms and entrepreneurs. This is what Phoenix needs. Support local!"}
{"text":"The food is really good. 

I've been there for lunch and dinner a more than a few times, I've also been in for beers/drinks only. The service is lacking to say the least. Lunch is busy and you order at the counter, find a place to eat, simple enough. Dinner is sit down, and ordered from a server. Every time I've gone in for dinner the service is just plain bad. I've usually been there during the week, not on a busy weekend, and you are lucky if you get a second visit from the server that does not include delivery of the bill. The bartender with the beard can also use some customer service lessons. He answers questions with a yes or no, will not elaborate when questions asked about a particular beer or drink, and just seems to be bothered by customers. I was just in again this Weds and had another disappointing experience with service. Prob won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I hope this trade area really supports this gem.  I LOVE the design and the food was very high quality.  Server was a little overwhelmed with the menu and seemed to need some more training on the food items, but he mad up for it with personality.  4 stars only because I have yet to try the morning menu.  Keep up the great work, I will spread the word.  BTW The Pork Confit sandwich rivals the Pig Rig at their sister restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"The very first Elite event I went to after moving back to AZ was here, and even though I don't live close by I've been meaning to come back & finally did recently.

I came here during Happy Hour (which I didn't even realize this place has), and I liked what they had to offer. My mom & I split a quesadilla and nachos. She had a glass of white wine & I had a mini pitcher of beer (off the top of my head I can't remember what, but it was an IPA brewed locally in Scottsdale that was pretty tasty). During HH each of these items were $5 (and like I said, the beer was a mini pitcher so it was more than a pint) so we had a pretty solid meal for $20. Both the quesadilla & nachos tasted yummy & the portions were generous. 

We were able to order everything from the bar & our food was ready pretty quickly. I should also mention that I realized I had a coupon in my wallet for a free cookie (from the Elite event mentioned earlier that was a LONG time ago), and when I sheepishly asked if I could use it I was told of course. The chocolate chip cookie I had was quite good. 

I wish I lived closer to this place so I could stop by more often, but I'll definitely remember it when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious , fresh food.  I ate breakfast at the market.  I had a huge bowl of fruit with granola.  I also had the breakfast sandwich the previous morning.  The portions are ample, servers are courteous, and the dining area was very clean.  Excellent value at reasonable price."}
{"text":"Two words - corn cookie. Try it. Now. 
Need to come back here for more than coffee and a cookie soon."}
{"text":"I just came in to pick up some macaroons. There were only 3 to choose from. Banana Peanut Butter, chocolate and tea flavored one and salted caramel. Got one of each. The only good one was the salted caramel but it was REALLY good. So good that I'll be back for just that one. Fingers crossed they have other favors."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food and atmosphere. Coffee is great too. Sometimes the music is really loud in the mornings so not a great place to read unless that does not distract you. The coffee barista has forgotten about my order a couple of times and I have to remind/ask/wait a really long time to be served. It's not a big deal but that was my only complaint as it's happened multiple times."}
{"text":"This place was a fun little stop on our recent trip to Phoenix! 

We came around lunch time, and the line was seriously backed out through the door - in the back of the restaurant. Craziness! But luckily, as we were waiting in line one of the bartenders offered us seats at the bar with no wait time. 

My sis and I split a couple of the meals like we usually do; she got the veggie plate with dips and I got a salad with some sort of wheatberry or similar type of grain. The salad was good, with lots of yummy goat cheese. The veggie plate was lacking - we received a lot of spinach and not so many dippable veggies for the sauces. Still good, but maybe not worth almost $10. My hubs got some sort of bagel sandwich that was super tasty.

Service was nice and friendly, and at the end when we asked for our yelp check-in cookie, he went and got them for us without us having to wait through the line. Very nice! Also, that cornmeal cookie I got was the BOMB, and I've been dreaming about recreating it ever since."}
{"text":"The service was good food was disappointing I waited an hour for the famous half chicken that was tbe size of a half a Cornish game hen.  disappointed over rated over priced DON'T order go to  Grassroots  were baby kay used to be by trader joes on 20th street same thing smoked great flavor and its more than one bite.  I live downtown want places to do well  I do recommend blue hound bliss the vig kinckaids happy hr and the luster bar tuna tartar and for those after hour cravings grand ave pizza open till 4 am."}
{"text":"I love Market Cafe, we especially love the banana bread macaroons for lunch we really enjoy having the rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes and vegetables. This place is very kid friendly and my little ones feel very comfortable there. I love the self-service of tea's and water, they even have sparkling water which I absolutely love. They also have covered parking which is important here in Phoenix. Bathrooms are clean and overall an enjoyable experience each time I've been."}
{"text":"Super chill with warm, friendly staff.  I had a great discussion about the difference between a macaron and macaroon with the bartendress, who apparently had just competed in a local bartending competition.  Great aesthetic with an indoor and outdoor seating area.  You can sidle up to the bar from outside as well.  A nice selection of beers and wines with a full bar, plus espresso.  I had a sandwich that was quite good.  It was a Rachel (Reuben with turkey instead of pastrami or corned beef).  The bread was super thick, so it was a mouthful and a half.  I was more than satisfied with the portion.  I also had a cookie because you got a free one with a Yelp checkin, not the macaron.  It was delicious.  I would go back here on a nice day fo'sho."}
{"text":"The BBQ pork sandwich and raspberry lemonade are amazing. Nice people and a fun atmosphere. Patio and indoor seating are both comfortable."}
{"text":"If there is one thing I miss about living in Downtown Phoenix, it is the breakfast at Phoenix Public Market.  The service is always friendly and they remember your face and sometimes your order.  They have a cute little coffee bar/bar set up with great indoor/outdoor eating space.  The tortillas and salsa that come with the Devil's Mess are a God-send.  They have juices, pastries and a large variety of menu items that range from healthy to IDGAF-about-my-waistline.  
We took a friend there one time and she was wondering why they put mashed potatoes on top of the cinnamon rolls.  We laughed and convinced her that mashed potatoes are great on top of cinnamon rolls and she probably still thinks that, but it was actually the thick frosting stacked on top.  
I've taken friends, family, and business friends here and have always enjoyed the menu, both breakfast, lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Love this precious cafe! Went for a Friday brunch around 10:30am with 4 of my co-workers. There's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Service is a little slow, but the hipster vibe is fun, and the coffee and food are delicious. I also like that they allowed me to customize my order- the breakfast burrito without the tortilla and added avocado. The portion was very satisfying, and they gave me a full chopped Avocado- my fav. I look forward to coming back sometime for lunch!"}
{"text":"Our first meal in Phoenix. we just landed and picked up the rental car. The first thing we did was to Yelped food. Anytime I see public market in the results it is usually a safe bet. 
Right we were. A great funky spot Burgers sandwiches baked goods coffee, Oh my. it was so good it was our first and on the way home our last stop..."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place with some friends and had a coffee at the bar (it was lunch and a work day or yes, a beer would have been ordered) and was just impressed with the set-up and the quality of the operations. Yes, as some have noted, it does seem like it can be a bit busy but the food looked great and I look forward to coming back for say dinner, one evening, and getting a better feel for the quality of the service and the food. I do like that the beers on tap were all micro-brews (begone though foul progeny of InBev!), and included beers from several local breweries and at least one beer, when I was there, from the Lost Abbey. I also noticed that in the liquor selection was bottle of copper city bourbon from Arizona Distilling company, which is made about two blocks from my house in Tempe, and the coffee being served was from Cartel, a local coffee chain and roaster. In short, when you come and buy food and drinks here, you are not only supporting a local restaurant but also a number of other local creators of quality food and drink. 

So far I'm a fan and look forward to seeing if a return visit will bring me into the five star category."}
{"text":"Yummy. YUMMY. yummy. Yummy. My review is still short. Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy. Food was good. Drinks were good. Ambiance was good. Decór was good."}
{"text":"I really love this place! I've been 3-4 times now and staff is always genuine and friendly and everything I've order has been yummy! It's a little pricey- think farm to table prices. They have a cute patio with misters on a hot day and plentiful free parking. A menu jam packed with healthy options and some not so healthy for when you're feeling naughty. A great spot to have breakfast, brunch or lunch with friends. 

Pictured- 

The salmon plate with brown rice instead of mashed potatoes. My friend said YUM!

The breakfast quinoa bowl- Vegetarian and gluten free YUM! 

I also love their coffee menu and coconut chia pudding!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great seating options, friendly, helpful staff, quick service, excellent coffee, easy-access location...and a free cookie!
 - Could it get any better?"}
{"text":"Two thumbs down for service and friendliness :[ 

Went in to grab a quick bite to eat for dinner with a friend. However, a quick bite to eat turned out to be a long wait for a disappointing experience. Our waitress completely forgot about us after seating us... and to make matters worse, it wasn't even busy... so how did she forget about the only people on the floor waiting to be served?

We waited for what felt like forever before we got up and went to the counter to ask if we could kindly place our order. Our waitress saw us talking to her co worker and came over to note that she had forgotten us.

So finally we got to place our order. However, 15 minutes after placing our order the manager came over and informed us that they were out of rice for the rice bowl we ordered, he coldly looked at us and didn't offer any other suggestions before dropping the menu on our table and walking away... so why didn't they just let us know that they were out of rice when we ordered? Or at least sooner??? 

Finally, when our food came out it was enjoyable, minus the burnt flavor of the nacho chips... someone must have forgotten those were in the oven too. 

After a few bites we ran out of salsa, as the side of salsa they provided wasn't enough for the portions they gave. So we waited for our waitress to come and check on us... and we waited.... and we waited... and despite her looking over at our table several times, and trying to grab her attention, not once did she stop by to check on us. 

My friend got up and asked the person at the desk for a side of salsa, he stated he was bored and he'd bring it right over... WAIT WHAT?! You're bored and no one has come to check on us for the past 20 minutes??? He proceeds to send over our waiter with the salsa and go walk around... we had empty plates sitting in front of us, water that no one refilled, and service that was never fulfilled, and he was bored. I'm pretty sure this guy was the shift lead to as he was clearly bossing everyone around. 

After all this we were more than ready to GTFO of this horrid experience, yet our waitress was nowhere to be found. So once again we went up to the desk to get out checks and as we were walking to the desk she came over and asked us if we were ready for the check... Needless to say this was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in downtown. I've had better service at Filiberto's. I love the food and concept of this place, but sadly this experience has made me reconsider coming back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed coming here for happy hour.  We ordered the Lee Trevino cocktail, downtown devil fries, and pork chile verde pot pie.  Our cocktail was REALLY good.  I highly recommend that drink.  The downtown devil fries were soooo good... I think it might be one of the top five fries I've had in my life.  They're skinny, packed with flavor, and come with a little heat (beware for those of you who don't like spicy.  But if you do, this is such a treat)!  Yumm.  The only semi-disappointment was the pot pie.  Everyone on Yelp was raving about the pot pie.  I thought it was okay... I've definitely had better.  The crust wasn't as flaky as I'd liked.

Service was great.  Don't forget about your yelp check in to get a free cookie!  (THEIR COOKIES ARE DELISH).

Tip:  dog friendly in the back patio.  Love that they spray mist on you when it's hot!"}
{"text":"Great burger, intersesting menu, great atmosphere and a friendly staff. Food came out quickly and correctly on a beautiful Friday afternoon."}
{"text":"I love the food, it is amazing. Small, quaint, great cocktails. Terrible terrible service during dinner. We had a person come to our table 5 minutes after sitting down to get us menus and tell us our server would be right with us. Then another girl came and gave us water and while we started asking questions about food she said she didn't know anything about the menu and our server would be right with us. Ok? Then our server finally shows up, we order and food takes 20 minutes. With two small children this wait was long but we know how to entertain our kids so it wasn't the end of the world.  

We are never disappointed with our food here but this is the second time we've dined here for dinner and I just think they need more ambitious people to serve food. They have no desire to \"serve\" anyone."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing food. Great place to grab a meal with friends."}
{"text":"Solid option for food, ambiance and free wi-fi + add character with an indoor & outdoor space that oozes comfortable cool.  Steel cut oats risotto was a solid way to start the day."}
{"text":"Few yelpers and I went to Happy Hour at Phoenix Public Market Cafe. The soft pretzels and cheese plate was really good. They only make a certain amount so you may not be able to get it on some days. All of us ordered the pork chili pot pie for dinner.  I got my pot pie first, and ended up only having two pieces of pork in the pie.  My pie consist mostly of onions and sauce, hardly any meat.  It was really spicy and needed a small topping of lettuce, tomatoes and maybe guac to cut the heat.  Our waiter asked how we liked it, and I mentioned that mine hardly had any meat in it.  He said \"you must of gotten the last bunch before they started making more\" ..um that's not a good excuse especially if I'm paying $9.50 for it plus drinks.  I like the fact they start happy hour at 3 pm till close plus they are open early for breakfast.  

It's a good place to try downtown and it's owned by the same individual as St. Francis.  It seems to attract an older crowd and families with young kids."}
{"text":"Their iced coffee is the most disgusting coffee I've ever had. I couldn't even drink it. Also, bad customer service. The guy who took my order was very rude. Maybe it was an off day? But I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I like the farm to table concept of this restaurant.  The food tasted very fresh and there is a herb garden long the front perimeter of the restaurant.  I found this restaurant on the list of restaurants on the Sheraton Grand Phoenix recommendations and then I googled good soups and the café came up.  

The 2nd treat was there was a Sunday and Monday prix fixe 3 course meal with several options for the main entrée.  The small salad was described and the dessert was chef's choice.  It was only $12.99 so it was a very good deal.  The fried chicken was very tasty only one piece had a small bone on the side.  Both pieces were white meat.

The 3rd treat was the yelp check in.  I got my choice of cookie.  I chose chocolate chip and it was very tasty even the next day."}
{"text":"I loved the floor plan, cute walk up bar, great pastries. My husband liked his burger but I think I got the wrong thing. 

Very relaxed atmosphere with friendly people.

Great French fries and awesome grape lemonade!"}
{"text":"Sunday breakfast with the family! Biscuits and gravy is delicious! Rooster booster is also so good. Fresh orange juice and good service!! Great ambiance. We sat on the patio. Love a warm morning with the misters. Great way to start the day!"}
{"text":"Great fresh bloody mary's!  Food was very good, and the atmosphere has a a lot of energy."}
{"text":"A group of colleagues does lunch out every Friday, and this was the selected spot a few weeks ago. There are 8 of us with quite varied taste buds, so it can be difficult to please us all -- but the Phoenix Public Market Café delivered. 

I got a burger, which was fantastic, and other members of our group also raved about their soup, breakfast options, and salads.

BUT - the one thing you cannot leave here without is one of their homemade pop-tarts. Yes, you read right. Homemade pop tarts.  Flaky, crispy, golden pastry layers filled with fruit and topped with perfectly sweet icing. Perfection."}
{"text":"I had to green child pork pot pie and it was great. We also had the pasta with poblano cream sauce and chicken and it was great as well. Service was lighting fast. Courteous people and great rustic/warehouse-esque environment. Nice!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this brief. The ambience is great, especially in the early winter in Phoenix. You can sit outside and enjoy a nice breeze. The tap is great, coffee solid. The food is plenty good. I got the Cubano which, despite being a bit cheesy/greasy, was good. It came with a pickle on the side (as it should) and three red grapes. The food didn't fill the large plate so it looked sparse and haphazard. The pickle I get, but three red grapes? Did they run out of something? The fries that I got on the side were good but they didn't give enough ketchup to last the whole bowl.

My main point of contention on the Public Market is the price, espcially relative to the quality and portions of the food. I recently moved from San Francisco, so I am very used to this style of food and the price you'd normally pay. But this is not San Francisco. This is Phoenix. And the main selling point of Phoenix is the cost effectiveness of it. For a Cubano sandwich and side of fries (no drink), I paid more than $16. For $16 in Phoenix, I expect much much more than a solid if unspectacular Cubano, a pickle spear, three red grapes, good french fries and not enough ketchup. Had this meal cost me $10-$12, it would be solid but not a value. There are plenty of other options downtown that provide superior food and a better value."}
{"text":"Great place and has parking. My new favorite breakfast place in Phoenix. I'm impressed with food at atmosphere, I cannot wait to try the bar!"}
{"text":"My family's favorite place in Phoenix! Perfect place for a group of friends or coworkers to sit and talk over great food and drink. Laid back atmosphere, phenomenal happy hour, parking, not insanely crowded, fantastic desserts, happy servers. Could not more highly recommend! My wife and I moved to Dallas 3 years ago and talk monthly about how much we miss Phoenix Public Market Cafe. Go here."}
{"text":"1000 percent obsessed with the Lee cocktail. And for that price! I've only eaten here a few times. I wish they had more exciting vegan options. The nachos a neighbor table had looked great."}
{"text":"The quinoa salad was delicious and cookies were ok. Btw you pick up your drinks they don't send it to your table. Right outside is a cute little farmers market w/ great selection of local produce and goods. I'd def come back and eat here again and check out the market."}
{"text":"Pastries, pancakes, pulled pork sandwiches, and booze! This farm to table restaurant has it all! I frequent this lively cafe during and after the farmers market they host every Saturday. The staff here are always super friendly and the atmosphere here is cool and fun. It's definitely a place to take a group of friends for a hang out.

I've tried their Pop Tarts, macaroons (Coconut Curry, Strawberry, Chocolate Espresso), BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich, Cinnamon Roll, freshly made Cafe Juice, Chicken Quesadilla and Ballerina cookie. All of which were very delicious except for the cinnamon roll. I ordered one to go and when I got home I was very disappointed. The texture of the roll was dense and dry. Although I can say the giant glob of buttercream frosting and caramel sauce on top was amazingly done. My most favorites are the coconut curry macaroons and the magnificent ballerina cookies! All of their macaroons are fabulously done and I love how they rotate the flavors. The coconut curry one was an interesting yet surprisingly yummy treat. The ballerina cookie is equally tasty as well, I just love the salt sprinkled on top. Get there early though because their ballerina cookies sell out fast!

All in all, a great place to chill and support local farmers!"}
{"text":"If you want to get the squirts, order their frittata (which sucked BTW - bland, very little pesto sauce, veggies, hidden by a mound of bitter greens. I couldn't tell if I was eating a salad on an omelette or the other way around).  The cafe latte was good, but small for a 'regular' sized coffee.  I was hoping to have a filling breakfast, butt, in the next several hours, everything came back out..."}
{"text":"Quinoa bowl was light and flavorful. I wanted something light so it was perfect. Chicken verde pot pie was delicious but very flavorful. Pulled pork sandwich was delicious too but a little too sweet for me. Check in for a free cookie. Delicious! Loved the decor and feel of the place."}
{"text":"In love. The veggie plate hits home for a picky vegetarian. Don't ever change."}
{"text":"Used location multiple times for mid morning business meetings. It worked well getting there around 9:30am. The food is good. The oatmeal is a large bowl, enough to share. I gave it three stars because I have tried several dishes and all were good, but not so great that I craved them. The coffee is good, but the large size iced coffee left me wanting more."}
{"text":"Great food friendly service healthy choices!! A must stop if your in Phoenix. Very good service"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Odd set up. Counter service unless you sit at the bar... Community seating. Distinct menu. I had the avocado hummus bagel (Roosevelt row). It was good and perked my curiosity to come back and try some other oddity on the menu."}
{"text":"Brought my mom to the market and decided to stop in for breakfast for the first time. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Good strong coffee. Will definitely go back for breakfast or lunch since I'm a regular at the market"}
{"text":"I love this place. I honestly can NEVER complain about their customer service. And to me that is key to the whole experience. I am always treated very kindly and everyone holds a conversation with you. SUPER BROWNIE POINTS! 

Located in the heat of downtown this place is pretty big! They have the kitchen area which is where the cashier is located. A spirit bar and a coffee bar. There is plenty of parking and plenty of seating indoor and outdoors. I've come here during their little farmer market days and I loved it! 

Their coffee is really good and you must order a few macaroon they are just too good. My husband and son approve of this place and that says a lot! 

The last time I came here I ordered their chickpea pancakes with agave syrup so delicious!! 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and I have never been anything but impressed with service and staff. I've tried so many of their entrees and they all have been great. A few of my favorites are the Rice Bowl and Phoenix Burger. 
I have friends who visit and the first thing we do is go get them a burger."}
{"text":"A great gem in DT Phoenix with fresh market fare, wood burning rotisserie chicken, pork, & prime rib. Freshly baked food intoxicate the dining room with yummy comfort. Seasonal, fresh, creative menu, helpful and eager staff. Make sure to order the rotisserie chicken with yummy hand cut fries."}
{"text":"My first impression of this restaurant was that it was hip and inviting. The host greeted us immediately and sat us quickly. Once we were seated it seemed as if we disappeared. Waters were brought to the table after waiting unusually long, and the server disappeared yet again. No question if we were ready or anything of that sort. Once he did come back to our table, we ordered a pitcher a beer and it was never brought out to us. We didn't even realize until our food was brought out to us. We didn't even bother to bring it up. We also had to ASK for refills of our waters (I was afraid to even ask for a refreshment at this point) When you walk into a certain type of atmosphere and get side swiped with careless service, that tends to leave people with a bitter taste in their mouth. The food was delicious but not enough to bring me back. I don't want to feel like I have to beg for a service I'm paying for. Too bad, I had high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"Good place even if it seems to trend a little too hipster for my taste. We flew into the airport and wanted a quick lunch before moving on to our destination. We found the Public Market Cafe on YELP, and the market itself was packing up when we arrived. The cafe serves breakfast until 3 pm so I went for the breakfast burrito. The burrito must have had 3 or 4 eggs - it was huge and full of cheese and bacon and best of all it was grilled - I love that. Tasted great. My wife ordered a salad but was a little annoyed when the dude at the register pointed her to the premade salads in the display case. Had she known it was already in plastic she would have ordered something fresher. The star of the meal was my daughter's bagel. The strawberry cream cheese I could have done without, but the bagel itself was homemade (in the restaurant) and it was fantastic. On the way out we picked up another 3 bagels to-go for breakfasts during our trip."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, the public market was happening just outside of the restaurant. I really enjoyed checking out the local vendors and then coming here for some local grub. This is a great place for out-of-towners to visit. 

Over the course of 5 days I ordered:
The Chino Salad
2 Kale Salads
The Lentil Curry Coconut Soup
A Brown Rice Bowl with Veggies
The Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie
A Corn Cookie
An Oreo Cookie
Six different Macarons

I've been sampling macarons across the country since I was first introduced to them in 2008, and let me tell you. These guys just topped my list for the title of favorite macarons in the US. SO GOOD! 

My next favorite item I ordered was the lentil curry coconut soup. It has such a nice delicate flavor and is perfectly comforting for a cold night."}
{"text":"We here last night for dinner. My friend picked this place because she knows I'm gluten free and vegetarian. Fortunately there were plenty of dishes for me to choose from. I ordered the salmon entree which came with mashed potatoes and roasted mixed veggies. The food was excellent! Our server was excellent! I took a star away because the size of my fish was small. For $18 I want an actual fillet not half a fillet. I will go back but not for the fish."}
{"text":"yooooo just get the Corn Cookie. You wont regret it.

Things I have gotten here over the years: Devil Fries, Eat the Rainbow, Lentil Curry Coconut Soup, the Cubano, the Pot Pie, the Rice Bowl 

All these things were great. excellent. I would gladly get them again. 

The only thing I got that I didn't really like was the Oatmeal but honestly, its my fault for thinking ordering oatmeal is ever a good idea. 

only reason why I am not going 5 stars is because 2 times that I have been here, service has lagged real bad. beyond the point of the excusable \"busy dinner hour\" justification. 

Aside from that, these guys are a neighborhood staple."}
{"text":"Brought family from out of town here. Menu recently changed and my favorite light and fluffy chickpea pancakes were replaced with awful blue corn pancakes.  One person ordered nachos which came out after the rest of us finished our meal. The nachos were burnt. We received a refund. After probably 20 visits to this place, I will not be returning.  Bummer :("}
{"text":"Wonderful place for breakfast downtown. The breakfast sammy (see photo) was more heavenly than I thought it could be. I don't know how those eggs were so fluffy, the bread was so great, and the cheese was so rich, but it was amazing. My suggestion: get it and split it with a friend. Neither of us could eat more than half.

Also, the atmosphere is just perfect for a Phoenix morning. I'm eager to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Terrific. Great food and service, and very reasonably priced. Love the ambience. In Phoenix for the weekend and started each day here. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great coffee and cookies.  The staff was very helpful as well.  The bartender/ barista suggested the Yelp deal."}
{"text":"I had the pork pot pie and it was AMAZING! Also had the cranberry Mojito which was great as well"}
{"text":"PPM is the best Saturday morning brunch adventure. Warm up with walking through the farmer's market and checking out the fresh produce and hand-made goods. Then enjoy the delicious bacon, avocado, and egg Flanched Flarney Garney sandwich. The white tea cold brew is refreshing and delightful. It's an overall truly delightful experience."}
{"text":"Fresh made to order, clean and positive vibes! Very hipster and friendly staff! Delicious food! Make sure to show your student ID for a 20% off !"}
{"text":"I just had chips, guacamole, and salsa along with a rice bowl and a pitcher of happy hour beer. I even got a free cookie for checking in on yelp. I am a happy girl. 

The guac/salsa portions were small, but sufficient for the $5 price tag. Oh, and they were delicious. Not spicy, if you're worried. The rice bowl was an awesome combination of flavors and textures, and I would eat it again and again. The pitcher of pils gave me two full beers, and I am super satisfied. The ladies providing counter service are doing an excellent job and are friendly to boot. Can't wait to come back with friends!"}
{"text":"I just adore this place! Inside the cafe it is so vibrant and lively. It almost makes Phoenix feel like a true big city! The staff seems pretty laid-back, but happy to be there. The food is so fresh and if you ever go to the Farmer's Market, you know that the produce is indeed fresh! I am glad to see they also had Cartel cold brew!!! I will be returning and I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful downtown cafe with delicious food and some of the sweetest staff members I've ever come across! The back patio is the perfect intimate environment to sit and enjoy a meal with a friend."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Aerosmith - I Don't Want To Miss A Thing)

I could stay to dine just to taste you pastries
Watch me smile while I am eating
While you're cooking and serving
I could spend my day in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Cause every dish I try at this place is a moment I treasure

Phoenix Public Market Cafe
I do wanna Yelp today
Cause I want to Bo Bites
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Cause even when I write of you
The sweetest words will never do
I'd still want to Bo Bites
Cause I don't wanna miss a thing

Phoenix Public Market Cafe doesn't look like much from the outside.  However, once you walk in the place is definitely different from your usual restaurant experience.  Order at the counter like any cafeteria/cafe and bring your number to a public table or if you choose sit at the bar.  

I went for the bar this time around.  Service was somewhat slow, but I wasn't in a rush that day.  I ordered a water since it was only a lunch break and went for the AZ burger.  Overall, the burger is pretty darn good in my books.  I didn't really care for one thing; the bun.  It was pretty dry and bulky, but the burger itself was cooked to perfection.  I had it medium and it was topped with Green Chili, Lettuce, Cheddar, and House Sauce.  I'm not sure what the House Sauce was, but all in all the ingredients worked and was mesh of sloppiness that reminded me of a Sloppy Joe.  Anything that brings back memories is a plus to my palates.  

The place itself was a farm art shop.  Very cute boutique-like stuff and a bakery that pumps out some desserts and baked goods.  The staff seemed friendly as if they were working at a Whole Foods.  Overall, a great atmosphere to chill and ain't nothing like supporting your local farms and restaurant! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding!!!!!!
I'm from LA and was just visiting, but if I lived in Phoenix... I'd be here just about everyday.

The Eat the Rainbow Salad is to-die-for."}
{"text":"Had a very good experience today at the Café for lunch.  Their black bean soup is great and, moving here from Miami, that says something!  Ordered the Burger, it was great and had wonderful spices and sauce.  The staff was as friendly and helpful as could be.  Very pleasant environment.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Come for the spacious, hip decor. Stay for the insanely inexpensive afternoon deals. 

This would probably be a good place to grab a sandwich, salad, and a cup of coffee, but since they've got a bar and some cocktails, you know I'll never get around to the normal, healthy options. Nah, I'm gonna stick to the cool $5 items on the happy hour. Like the Lee Trevino, fulfilling my cravings for both spice and elderflower. Tastes amazing, and quite frankly, I'd pay tons more. Best enjoyed with other small bites. 

If I ever make it early enough, I'll tell you about the bagels. =)"}
{"text":"Today was my first time going to that restaurant. 

I went with my good friend's daughter and she really enjoyed herself. We had a cinnamon roll (really good ) and  two poached eggs (really good )  and iced coffee and a couple strawberry lemonade. 

The service was very good ! 

I apologize I didn't catch the tall blond server name and Latin female name (and I apologize for the the descriptions I just didn't know their names so I'm only going to describe them) They were both amazing servers so thank you both ."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is excellent.  I loved the decor as I walked in, and the display of local handmade goodies. I had the \"eat the rainbow\" salad and it was wonderful.  So simple but the local veggies were perfect and the the sauces were so yummy! ! My boyfriend had one of the burgers and absolutely loved it, and he also loved my salad too, as he picked at some of the veggies.  I would definitely return!  I would love to come for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Really like this cafe.  Been going there for about 2 years but not often enough.
I like the fact that they have their own parking lot so I don't mind the drive.
Their pulled pork sandwiches are the best I have found.
Happy Hour menu is quite varied and appetizing.
Bartenders are on their toes.  Even though I had not been there for quite some time my friend and I walked in and he remembered exactly what we order and how we like it served.
I am tasting that sandwich and knowing I really need to get back there very soon."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious. I had the chicken and 2 sides and left wanting more. The portions are on the slender side but good for not feeling stuffed at the end of my meal.
The fries are great but a little more generous helping... come on it is a potato.
The chicken was finger licking sticky good. I could have devoured a whole bird easily... darn organic birds are soo petite. Bring on the GMO chicken the size of Godzilla with breasts as big as Texas. I would definitely come back for the chicken.
We didn't try any of the baked goods but the cinnamon roll had a fedora of sweet tooth glazing that was begging to be eaten."}
{"text":"I love this spot downtown! Even on the weekend when the market is going on they are pretty quick with food. Their coffee is excellent. My fave breakfast item is the biscuits and gravy! **when Matt's line is ridiculous on Sundays come here, no wait!"}
{"text":"I'm always near the area & finally decided to try this place out. It was a Monday night near closing time, & they have the 3-course dinner special for $12.99 (Sun & Mon nights from 5pm-close). There are three options, but I got the fried chicken with mashed potatoes with a salad and red pudding dessert. The fried chicken had a REALLY thick layer of breading, but overall was pretty good. The salad was standard and the red pudding was sweet and yummy! I also had french macarons from their in-house bakery to-go. They make it from scratch and as a macaron connoisseur, I thought they were pretty good! I'd come back again and try a different dish and their other pastries.

The aesthetics in here are so cute, and when I went, seemed pretty casual. I can see it as being good for both dressy & casual though! There's parking right outside of it and a farmers market every Saturday."}
{"text":"I went into the phoenix public market the other day to kill some time. Sat up at the bar and received  the best customer service anyone could ask for. The bartender, I didn't catch her name, was funny, friendly, extremely knowledgable, and honestly made the entire experience; whoever she is deserves a crown for being such a queen.

She made me a custom cocktail using their ginger blueberry lemonade and tequila (who cares what else was in there, can I get an amen?) and as I was unsuccessfully deciding on what kind of dessert to get, she recommended some of the new soft serve ice cream.

This. Is. The. Softest. Servyest. Ice. Cream. Of. All. Time. 

Eating this was, without a doubt, a spiritual-culinary event. I heard Anthony Bourdain's spirit come floating down from the ether, subtly insulting all other ice creams to have come before this one. No more of that Ben and Jerrys garbage, a vile and sorry excuse for Gods favorite frozen dessert, give me PPMC's ice cream or give me death. This stuff is better than the entire working relationship between George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, which I would like to watch in chronological order, back to back, while gorging on this soft serve. 

Anyway, after I had climbed down the Holy Ladder of Sweet Tooth, Queen Bae Bartender hooked it up with a cold brew (delicious and effective) and I skid-addled resting atop the sugary cloud 9 I was just placed on. 

Then I remembered I'm lactose-intolerant."}
{"text":"This was the worst breakfast place I've eaten at.  Our breakfast was COLD, I hate to send food back to the kitchen for fear of what the cooks might do to it but I had to sent it back.  The young man behind the counter apologized and said they would re-do the breakfast.  The next time we got out food it was \"SLIGHTLY\" warm.  My mom ordered the House Made Biscuits and Gravy - we were disappointed to taste the chorizo in the gravy was sweet - isn't chorizo supposed to be spicy?  My daughter ordered the Devil's Mess - and it was a mess to say the least!  It looked like it was just thrown on the plate without any care.  I will never eat at this place again."}
{"text":"It pains me to do this, but it must be said.

This place has gone down the drain. 

When it first opened I came here often and loved the videos of the plants growing on the screens, the food and the friendly service. I used to take many of my clients out here just so they could soak in the vibe. 

I've been here a few times within the past few months and each time my experience gets worse. Today really took the cake.

I came in to order for take out. The place wasn't busy and I even got a parking spot out front! I put 20 minutes on the meter not imaging how my regular order of the Roosevelt which is basically avocado on toast could take any longer. 

I placed my order and waited, and waited and waited and waited. 

37 minutes after the transaction time on my receipt my to go order comes out. The girl who handed it to me was incredibly rude and the box of food was wide open! 

To really sprinkle the sugar on top I walked outside to discover that not only did I get terrible service and wait forever, I had also received a parking ticket! 

I will not be returning here. There are too many other new places in downtown that make quality food, offer good service and can put a takeout order out in less than 40 minutes."}
{"text":"It was the perfect weather to be seated outdoors eating an open salad and one of their specialty cocktails. I loved this place! It's in a random part of town, from what I could gather, but the fresh ingredients and the quick service was very impressive. Make sure you grab a couple macaroons on your way out!"}
{"text":"I havent been here in a while  but the food was amazing, and was done in a timely manner. I got my good to go and they made sure i had everything and made sure all my questions were answered. I believe i got an apple butter sandwich from here and was super excited. I will definitely be back,  beware of finding parking during the week though its super busy and parking is hard to find some times."}
{"text":"This place is not bad and not great. I came in today for some eggs after the gym, it was maybe 3:02pm and breakfast is over at 3 and I was denied. Now I get that I was 3 minutes late but really??? Couldn't have made me an egg?? That's just ridiculous to lose business over 2 minutes."}
{"text":"Service was terrible but eat the lentil coconut curry soup!! So worth it!!!! Also, great happy hour- 3 pm to close."}
{"text":"This is always full of friendly people, good food and drinks of all kinds. Remodeling has expanded the seating capacity greatly. Health meeting taste is blended well. Breakfast is great, but the fried chicken dinner is a slam dunk!"}
{"text":"My first meal here was a long time ago, and I wrote the following review, but I wrote the review for the market itself, rather than the cafe, so Yelp deleted my review

The evening air was beautiful, so I opted for a patio spot. A bit on the loud side for phone conversations, but not excessive for socializing.

Ordered the Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie, did not regret it one bit.

PERFECT crust! Thick top layer, thin sides, great color, nice, crisp edges.

The Chile was amazing! Good colors, great flavor profile, excellent heat, big chunks of pork.

The portion size was just about perfect, though I could have easily consumed another.

I waited far too long to dine at the market. My experience was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday for a quick breakfast bite at the recommendation of a friend. The place was crazy busy. There were people everywhere. Lots of movement. The service was expedient. The breakfast burrito wonderful. The orange juice, meh. I will definitely return.."}
{"text":"Food is better than good..  the Farmers market is great.  But the coffee needs consistency.  It's as if they are relying on the Roasters they source from to magically make the consumers think the coffee is going to be good.  Figure out how to make an Americano or a Cappuccino the right way and consistently.

Oh and the wine program is really bad.  Seriously just try a little....  please...."}
{"text":"Sad to say that PPMC has taken a steady nose dive with its food quality, customer service and value.  My better half and I would look forward to walking to the cafe for dinner at least one night a week.  Within the past two months, we have noticed an increased staff turnover, poor food quality and terrible customer service.  Prices have increased with portions shrinking (3 ounces of salmon is standard for the dinner plate), new servers are absent and rude at best, and expect to wait 45 minutes for your meal after placing your order.  With the recently added tables in the dining room, it's as though they chose quantity over quality.  At our last visit to to the cafe, these sentiments were shared with other guests as we saw lots of meals being sent back to the kitchen and the manager making the rounds to dispute complaints from patrons for extended waiting times, cold food and wrong orders.  Very disappointed.  Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Here's one to check off the list! I've had my eye on this place ever since moving to Phoenix and I must say, it was kind of worth the wait!

Though I was not able to try their coffee, I did make it in time for their happy hour (3-close, every day) and wanted to take advantage of that fact. I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich and a pitcher of beer, also since you get a free cookie if you check-in on Yelp I went with the corn cookie to see how well it ranks against Momofuku in NY and that of Cartel's.

The pulled pork sandwich was came with thick pieces of pulled pork, flavorful, good sauce and the red cabbage/bell pepper slaw was delicious with it. The bun was substantial enough to sop up the pulled pork juices and hold everything together. Comes with some fruit as well. For $5 on HH, it's pretty damn good for the price you pay. Also for $5 you can grab yourself a pitcher of beer (2 glasses)! The corn cookie albiet free, was not the best corn cookie I've ever had it was a bit too dense and hard- was it because I came late in the day? Anyways, it was free so I can't complain too much! Normal pricing seems a bit steep, but this cafe has it all from soups, sandwiches, salads, coffee, alcohol and pastries.

Public Market has that warehouse feel with reclaimed wood furniture, tree stump tables, a bar, brick and exposed piping. It's very aesthetic and gives the place a nice, industrial yet rustic feel. I love the big windows so you can have a bit of sun yet get work done on the tables in the corner of the cafe.

Can't wait to be back for their coffee and to use up that little corner of the cafe to bask in the sunlight!"}
{"text":"I was waiting and waiting and waiting . . . .so when they finally did re-open I was so busy with work that it took me a while before I had the opportunity to actually try the new Cafe at Phoenix Public Market. 

I think I had it so blown-up in my mind that it was going to be good, or even great  that I . . . oh, what the heck, I don't want to lie about it . . .it was fantastic! I ordered the Mediterranean Salad and it was enormous. I tried and tried, but I just could not finish it all. Not for lack of trying believe me . . . and I always save room for dessert. But . . . 

This time I had to buy my dessert from the bakery case and take it home with me. A very large chocolatey-fudgie cookie. And, believe me that was a \"snack\" worth waiting for that evening.

My only disappointment was the cinnamon roll that I bought for breakfast. It looked beautiful, but a secondary spice that overpowered the cinnamon made it a disappointment.  It was a good roll, just not a great cinnamon roll. My advice is to take out the \"other\" spice and maybe add a few pecans . . . and whatever you do leave off the sugar icing. A little cream cheese icing would have gone a lot further to help me finish off my breakfast coffee! 

I did not try the Cafe coffee, since it was a steaming day . . . next time. Oh, yes, I will be back to try some of the other goodies on the menu. Perhaps the Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie, or the Roosevelt Row Bagel, or one of their great sounding housemade soups - Southwest black bean, lentil curry coconut soup, or their beans & rice bowl.

Hunger is overtaking me . . . do you know where the car keys are?"}
{"text":"My wife and l drives all the way from north Scottsdale to this lovely environment.  Keeo up you excellent servuce and quality of food.
Thanks.

{"text":"Visited here after a Giants spring training game for a drink. It was so fabulous we decided to come here for breakfast. The ambiance and quality of food did not disappoint  

Definitely coming back next spring."}
{"text":"Breakfast served from 7am-3pm. Lunch served after 11am.

Chickpea pancakes - Super interesting, it is extremely fluffy with a lighter taste. I would recommend giving this a try because it's different from a normal pancake.

Cowgirl Cookie - cranberries, white chocolate, oats. Nicely rounded and soft!

Corn Cookie - corn flour, sweet corn cookie, has a slight corn taste that is not too overwhelming. This cookie is much stiffer and crispier due to the corn flour I assume.

Cinnamon Roll - AMAZING, highly recommend trying if you like cinnamon rolls.

Devil's Mess -  a pretty standard scramble with a tortilla on the side.

I love the atmosphere here, there are a lot of communal tables with great rustic decorations. There's a separate order counter for food and for coffee drinks, you order first and snag a number before finding your own table. This is a great place to have a nice casual meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone here a few times, breakfast is great, I love their breakfast. Dinner time is also great, they have cute little pitchers for 5 dollars. But their fried chicken is miserable. They had no Meat on the bones, for $16 you would expect a good amount of chicken. NO, the amount of meat was the same compared to one chicken tender from chick-fil-e. But everything else is amazing."}
{"text":"We went during lunch and you couldn't move much less find a table. Our order was delivered fast and the chicken salad sandwich was literally the best I've ever had but please get a bigger location, everyone knows your secret! Great food!"}
{"text":"Met some family here for dinner. Had a burrito bowl and (just about) one of everything from the bakery case. Everything was amazing and we will be going back."}
{"text":"Just returned to Public Market after a not so great experience after I was treated to a gift card to offset that cost. It was great! I found out I get 20% off since I'm a graduate student at ASU, enjoyed a  chicken salad sandwich with crisp arugula, curried mayonnaise, and walnuts on the toastiest bread with a chocolate chip cookie for dessert. If you're lucky enough for them to have more of their tangerine rosemary lemonade, get it! Its herbal notes pair perfectly with their chicken salad. Thank you Public Market for so meaningfully apologizing for the initial meal mistake, and for such a delightful return experience (even at lunch rush where we still had no problem finding a table!)"}
{"text":"Downtown. Sister Property, St Francis. I ordered the chopped mediterranean salad 8.25. Greens, garbanzo beans, shaved red onion, olives, Crow's Dairy feta, sherry vinaigrette, plus sliced chicken from the rotisserie. I think that was an additional 3.  

The beer was Mother Road \"Gold Road\" Kolsch Style Ale, on draft $5. Pours a copper color. The flavor is crisp, lightly hoppy and a pretty clean, very drinkable brew from Mother Road Brewing Company, Flagstaff. 

I sat at the bar and as usual, was chatting away with the staff and customers. I asked Marena my server, who btw is very cool, if she knew anything about the history of this early 1900's, Phoenix Red Brick building. Then I hear, seated next to me, down 4 or 5 bar stools, a man speak up, saying I'm a historian. 

Chef Dennis McGarry, a historian that lives at the Westward Ho began to speak about the area in the 1930's. This building was a used car dealership. Of course there were the Buicks, the Dodges, Fords and Chevrolet's. Oldsmobile's, Packard's and Plymouth's. This whole area on Central was automobile dealerships and resale. And the Phoenix Public Market Cafe was a showroom of used automobiles.

Chef Dennis invited me to tour with him, the Westward Ho. He lives in a suite that Jacky Gleason registered. As a side note, I asked \"what are you eating?\" He replied \"the pulled pork sandwich and it's pretty good.\" He ate it all and got a slice of the French Silk Pie to go. I ate a cupcake.

{"text":"Solid. Food is a good selection of clean/healthy and tasty as well as great tasting burgers and wood grill entrees.  Good selection of local beers and a comfortable patio. Win for downtown happy hour options."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I go here a few times a week in between classes and try to change up what I get every time. Their coffee is great, their food is great, the people are great, and the environment is great. All of their food is locally sourced, which I find fantastic, and on Saturday's they have an open-air farmers market. Sitting inside or outside doesn't matter and you can pick where you sit. Their water cups also include fizzy water, which I absolutely love. They also have already-made to-go boxes of food if you're in a hurry. The service is always speedy and I have yet to have a less than optimal experience. 10/10 recommend"}
{"text":"The coffee is delicious (I got an iced honey latte) and the food is great! It has a big seating area inside and outside on the patio is a nice place to enjoy some drinks and relax on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"I really loved the atmosphere here. We sat outside Friday night at 730 and didn't have to wait. I got the pulled pork, I wish it was shredded a bit more and was a little more wet. Atmosphere gets a 5, pulled pork gets a 3."}
{"text":"LOVE 2 menu items here. 1. The rotisserie chicken with veggies and sweet potato 2. Lentil Coconut Curry soup (I like to also add chicken). Staff is so nice, friendly and helpful. Cute little place and cute inside."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with this place. If you are looking for a spot to chill, maybe put your earbuds in and work a little, or catch up with some friends - this is your place. Owned by the same guy who owns St Francis, it's a classy place to grab a beer or a coffee. The bathrooms are dope too. Nothing super special, but unique and fitting. They pay attention to detail. 

The only reason I give it four stars instead if 5 is for their menu. I wish there were seasonal specials. I realize it probably keeps costs down to not invent new specials but even like a flatbread? The 18$ roasted salmon plate just doesn't fit here. I come frequently and the menu seems stagnant. 

Don't get me wrong the food is uh-mazing. Everything we've had is great. The Mediterranean and the chino salads are great. My fiancé loves the pork chile verde pot pie and the grilled cheese is total comfort food (I suggest adding tomato or avocado).

If you haven't stopped by this gem in downtown I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"On a trip with my son from Michigan to visit ASU campus. We are staying downtown and took the train to find some food. As it was a Sunday evening, our choices were very limited. We happened upon this place and were completely blown away. 
Entering I was delighted to see a high level of craftsmanship in their dining area. While it is not the rustic, hipster, foodie place it could come off as being, it delivered an excellent meal by a very well informed waitress, Victoria- ask for her, you'll like her. 
I had a chicken caesar salad and was shocked to find they actually use chunks of chicken off of a rotisserrie chicken in the back- not a diced up breast from the grill. My son ate an Arizona burger and loved it. We shared a piece of their chocolate cake and it was a perfect end to a great meal. We have three more days here in the area and I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Dope atmosphere, great music (The Shins, Bombay Bicycle Club, etc). 

Happy hour is great, you can get a small pitcher (about 2.5 beers) for $5. That pitcher selection is limited but most other drinks are reasonably priced. Especially their adult coffee mix drinks."}
{"text":"Rockin' Food + Communal Dining Market Experience

I'm batting 1.000, today. After an amazing brunch in Baltimore, took my wife and our little girls to PPMC this evening. I so did not expect Phoenix to have a place like this.

The decor is open, with rustic-farm appointments, and a deli-like ordering area in the back. We opted for communal seating over the bar area and outside tables. Service staff was super friendly and the place was hopping.

All the food was yummers. Best described as simple and tasty fare. My burger was straight good and wasn't overcomplicated by odd pairings. My wife loved her Cubano while our girls liked their AB&J sandwiches. The pretzel app was a hit, too.

As much as anything, the collegial atmosphere was fun and made the experience better. We chatted with a skinny young woman who was demolishing her prime rib and making me feel like less of a man with how she tore through it. Fun gal and always good to meet new people in a social eating setting. Kind of like an anglo version of a luau. lol

Wrapped up, I was impressed that the meal for four actually came with a reasonable price. So, we fixed that by ordering some extra dessert to go: Macaroons!"}
{"text":"Love this partial service neighborhood spot where locally grown products shine. It's a great place to grab breakfast or a pastry (seriously, the pop tarts will change your life), a healthy and quick lunch, or even a coffee or drink at the bar. Although the salads are pricey, they're packed with fresh, flavorful and largely local vegetables. They also serve small fresh juices, including one with red pepper and Fresno chilis that has a bit of a kick. At lunchtime, you can simply grab and go with these items. Don't forget to add a homemade nutter butter or cookies and cream - the baked goods are awesome. You could even bring work - there's free wifi and it's not unusual to see people posting up with their laptops. The friendly staff won't mind if you set up shop."}
{"text":"Fries, lemonade, banana bread best parts of my order."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with a friend. Immediately upon walking in I loved the atmosphere. Very few choices on the breakfast menu but the food was good. The coffee was great and they probably have the best bagels I've ever had!!! Oh and make sure you try a corn cookie!"}

{"text":"Amazing! Always have an excellent time coming here. The service is always great and the staff seems to be happy. I went there for two years and still saw a lot of the same staff. That says something. Food is excellent, and that happy hour sangria, YES!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: hip and modern with a lot of wood accents. Most of the tables are communal with benches but a solo diner can eat at their large bar that looks out to the patio. 

Food: solo lunch today around 11 on a Tuesday. Their beans and rice was very tasty. Brown rice and black beans in sort of a Cuban style in decent sized bowl. They add avocado, and salsa, and a bit of cilantro. I asked them to hold the feta. Portion was an ideal size-- not too big. Lime slice was a good addition. That and a drink was about $11. 

Rating: I'm not giving them a five because this was a quick lunch but I would definitely come back and tell my friends so I can try more dishes. Friendly staff, good food, decent prices."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful.  And the free cookie was a plus.  A little pricy but def yummy.  The first time I went  with my girlfriend, they had a special menu that offered very low priced meals. Great deal but no substitutions. This didn't bother me because it all sounded yummy.

I ordered the fried chicken. And mashed potatoes with broccoli.  The meal starts with a small salad of mixed greens.  

She had the spaghetti and meatballs. We both had left overs and left happy and full, cookies in tow.  

On the second trip we noticed that there was no special menu available. But we knew the food was good so we didn't mind. Both times we checked In for the free cookie.  The chocolate chip was almost all chocolate and barely any cookie.  Just perfect for a chocoholic like my self."}
{"text":"Nothing but great things to say about this place. If you want healthy food -they've got it. If you want a fun atmosphere - it's here. If you want cool servers - look no more. Definitely try the everything behind the pastry case. Favorites are the Eat The Rainbow salad, Meatloaf, Pretzels & Cheese and the breakfast burrito."}

I opted for a grilled cheese w/FF and a chocolate chip cookie as well as a macaroon (I have a sweet tooth and their sweets rock!) We also ordered their pork pot pie, so different, so filling, so yummy! There are several things I was trying to decide on so I guess this means I'll be coming back soon and trying the other items. Loved the vibe of this place, great for people watching, to hang with friends, to enjoy a casual brunch with friends or family. Very kid friendly too, loved the outside seating area with fans and water misting to keep you cool through these Arizona hot summers. I'd also like to note that even though I ordered at the counter then sat down and they bring the food to us, the servers seemed very friendly and helpful as well if we needed anything else. Make sure you leave them a nice tip, they were working so hard and with a smile."}
{"text":"This place has an interesting vibe. I ordered the tri-tip which was hard to cut into chew. Next time I will listen to the waiter and have their special rotisserie chicken. Unfortunately I was not in the mood for chicken that night. Sides or good and so is dessert. Would give this place another try."}
{"text":"Phoenix Public Market is a great addition to the downtown Phoenix area. While it is a bit more expensive than I feel it should be, I absolutely love the pastries. The food is phenomenal,  and the drinks are great. They use Cartel coffee, which I love, but the employees at PPM don't make it quite as good as you'll find at the Cartel shop.  I love the outside seating!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by last night for dinner. Immediately I knew I would like this place when I saw the exposed brick and wooden accents and heard Hozier and alt J over the speakers. I had the \"eat the rainbow\" which was literally that. Rainbow colored veggies over a bowl of lemony greens with three different homemade dipping sauces - pesto, ginger, and some kind of yellow ranch tasting sauce. The veggies were crisp and fresh and the dish was filling - lots of different colored cauliflower, broccoli, and baby squash. I really enjoyed all the colors visually too. My boyfriend had the fried chicken which was moist yet not greasy and the sides of mashed potatoes and kale salad complimented really well. It looked so good I had to steal a bite. Try the Lee Trevino cocktail! It's got a unique flavor and a surprising kick from the habanero. Can't wait to explore this place for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Was in AZ for a seminar and literally ate here 3 meals in a row!!!!  Guess you could say we liked it.  Very GF and Vegetarian friendly = big plus!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since they have opened and while the food is good, I feel that the kitchen continues to lack attention to detail. Every time I order the Flarny Garny sandwich I ask for no mayo and even though the server repeats it back they still somehow always put mayo on it. I end up having to sit waiting for my sandwich to get remade while everyone else eats their breakfast. Overall it's good, I have tried numerous things on the menu mostly breakfast; biscuits and gravy, rooster booster, burrito and they are all very good. I love the atmosphere. I wish they would wrap the silverware instead of leaving it in the cup on the table unwrapped. I also order a pop tart pretty much every time and while I do enjoy them heated up, they have served it to me burnt more often then not.  But overall, it's good so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm done eating and I thought I would put down a few thoughts and questions.  The space is great the look, fixtures the bar and counter are all done well I love the view of the kitchen. We came for a late breakfast , oatmeal was good we wished all the accompaniments had come separately oatmeal is a dish we think a lot of people might have their own special mix for.  I had a standard eggs, bacon, potato, toast.  I asked for a extra egg it never showed up but my girlfriend order one egg scrambled on the side an I'm pretty sure my extra egg over easy made it in to her frying pan.  

I don't get the counter service,  a number of places around town have it.  How much do I tip and how much are your servers getting paid?  What do I do if I feel that my visit was inadequate ? It seemed you were over staffed yet I didn't get the quality attention I expect.  A waiter needs the tips at the end to stay motivated.  I'm a waiter and I would hate having to run food here and not know from looking at the ticket who ordered which item, auction every plate of food at a table is bad service.  Your staff Is great they are friendly and comfortable with their roles, If any thing they could get pushed to work harder and make a few more bucks  with tips and hourly I hope your FOH staff is averaging $20 per hour"}
{"text":"Great place for some good good and lots of beer options. Great location if you are in downtown. The farmers market that occurs on the weekend is great as well. On occasion they also have shows."}
{"text":"I was there for lunch yesterday 7/2/2013 and had th emost amazing experience. We normally go for lunch pretty frequently and I have had nothing but awesome food. i am obssessed with the chicken salad sandwhich and then the Chino salad in that order. I haven't had a bad dessert and I have yet to drink there but that's to come for sure. 

We go in and oorder and it's packed for lunch. My colleauge and I sit outside, which wasn't too bad for the first 20 minutes and I notice that my food hadn't arrived yet. Just as I was thinking about it , Cory the manager comes out to tell me that they are comping my food. He said that the wait was completely unacceptable and basically that's not how they roll. The truth of the matter is, I would have waited another 20 minutes for that sandwhich. It really made my day to have that happen. It feels like such a rare occassion that people go out of their way and it's nice when to see."}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly staff, fresh, nicely prepared food and great ambience for families, couples, friends. I drive up from Tucson about once a month to meet my son here for breakfast. Today's breakfast included an informative discussion with one of the staff about the difference between a macaron and a macaroon. (Yes, they're entirely different, and PPM serves yummy macarons.)"}
{"text":"Awesome location and incredible, attentive staff. Had the rotisserie chicken and the wife had the Caesar salad. Both were delicious and we will definitely return for future lunch meals."}
{"text":"We love the public market! We drive here from the east valley every time we get a chance. The food is always great, but the best on community dinner nights when you get 3 courses incredibly cheap. We love that kids meals are $3?! And it's *real* food instead of junk. The staff are usually friendly, there is one waitress in particular with RBF and we try to avoid her area, otherwise the service is good. And if you're and ASU student you get 20% off!"}
{"text":"Great food! I got their \"The Chino\" salad and a side of steamed broccoli and my mom got their chicken quesadilla and a baked sweet potato on the side. We both loved our food. She also really enjoyed a glass of Cabernet and a slice of carrot cake (I had a bite, it was phenomenal).

Their prices are quite high, but the taste is well worth it.

The atmosphere of the place is nice as well: young, hip, and trendy are three words I'd use to describe it. If you find yourself in downtown Pheonix you should pop in and check it out!"}
{"text":"Had to add on that we had a delicious green Chile burger and the pretzels and cheese are divine!"}
{"text":"Phoenix Public Market Cafe
Cartel Coffee
Cinnamon Roll
Strawberry Pop-Tart
Apple Crumb Tart
Corn Cookie
Cowgirl Cookie
Ballerina Cookie
Peanut Butter Cookie
Banana Bread

Part of the continuing rebirth of Downtown Phoenix, a hip 3-meal restaurant, bar, and bakery peddling fresh ingredients under the premise of \"Building Community Through Food,\" it was after perusing the various options offered at the open-air stalls outside that I entered Phoenix Public Market Cafe, the options running the gamut from healthy to truly gluttonous with service that couldn't have been more pleasant if it tried.

Offering seating options ranging from tables to booths to bars, unlimited Cartel Coffee available alongside local artisan products and menu items ranging Chickpea Pancakes and Ceviches to BBQ Pulled Pork and a \"Ballerina Cookie\" riddled with Espresso it should seem obvious to anyone standing in line that the baked goods are a source of pride for the cafe, all but the underflavored banana bread at the very least 'good' while several were far better.

Eventually settling on a half-dozen items - before glistening cinnamon rolls emerged from the kitchen and a social media check-in netted a free cookie - it was at the hightop bar juxtaposing one laden in top-shelf spirits that a seat was taken, a few passers-by chuckling at what surely appeared an  overzealous spread.

Not foolish enough to ignore effects of freshness, the cinnamon roll actually served with cream cheese frosting in a sidecar as the kitchen feared it was still too hot to top, those fancying a truly decadent pastry need look no further than this golden spiral of brioche and butter, the topping actually helping to tame sweetness without losing its smooth texture at all.

Taking a break in the sizable coil to refill coffee and try more things it was with banana bread cast aside that a tasting of four cookies commenced and with crispy rims encircling soft centers in each a \"best\" option really comes down to personal preferences, the Cowboy not dissimilar to the flavors of Trail Mix while the corn version tasted exceedingly natural, as did the Peanut Butter 'with a schmear.'

Always hopeful to see an artisan Pop-Tart compete with the cellophane-wrapped originals of days gone by it can only be said that the version offered at Phoenix Public Market Cafe is a very good Toaster Strudel, but still not the 'real deal,' the Apple Crumb Tart a far more worthwhile expenditure of cash and calories with an all butter crust chock-a-block full of apples and streusel overlying a liquid caramel core."}
{"text":"Stopped in this past weekend while on the Urban Wine Walk (such a fun event to highlight great restaurants around downtown Phoenix). We almost skipped out on the Market but I am glad we made the trek over from the other places on the stop! We got a glass of wine and split Eat the Rainbow. Do you like veggie platters and salads? Don't think just order this asap. It was delicious and oh so pretty!!! Plus we weren't that hungry but between two women this was a solid amount of food. The wine we sampled was the house white, perfect choice for a warm day. We will definitely be back. 

I would give this place 5 stars if it weren't for the loud music. It was middle of the day Saturday. The restaurant was fairly full and if it weren't for sitting next to the wall we would have had to yell at each other to hear/be heard. Not sure why places think music has to be so loud to be an enjoyable atmosphere. 

Check in on Yelp and you can get a free cookie. All the desserts looked delicious but we went with the Mexican Chocolate macaroon. Perfect size for sharing."}
{"text":"Very slow service and meh food. Not a good first impression. Definitely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"OMG! I just love this place!! Their Cabbage salad is to Die for!!! and I'm not a huge salad person, so that alone says a lot! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of choices for breakfast downtown on New Year's morning. Of course, Matt's was open but the line was so long it would be January 2nd before we got seated. And besides we wanted to try something new to start the New Year off.  We had just stayed down the street at the newly restored Art Deco Hilton Garden hotel and despite it having a chain-name it really felt like a part of Phoenix's core.  Chain-name places of any type usually don't even make our short list at all.  So after driving over to another nearby place that was doing everything in their power to communicate they didn't want any customers (which worked really well ... we walked out), we came here.

Phoenix Public Market Café is only a couple of years old but somehow feels like it has deeper roots, especially to the cadre of local neighbors who were walking over for breakfast.  Not pretentious people, nor is the café pretentious. There are a lot of things to like about it. But we came for food, and right off I got good vibes about the menu choices.

I opted for The Devil's Mess (3 eggs, Schreiner's chorizo, tortilla, fire-roasted salsa, chiles & onions scrambled), which at $7.95 is a cheap eats bargain.  The amount of food served is impressive and tasted good.  The place was pretty full but our food was delivered in only about 5 minutes.  I don't have a picture of it (I was hungry) but I will say that I ate the whole thing. Overall they had a lot of interesting menu choices - definitely not your typical restaurant breakfast fare!

The surroundings are comfortable, neither fancy nor divey.  They did I good job at not becoming a cliché. The people who work there seem to be VERY happy and content, and hey, isn't that the way it should be to start a new day in a new year?

Kiddingly I said I was reluctant to write a review because Guy Fieri might find out about this place and then everyone will know about it.  But for now, let's keep it between just you and me ... this may be the best breakfast spot in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food (I had breakfast to quell a hangover...) was pretty good, but I also like their drinks and atmosphere. Good place, I'm hoping they do more community events, like that one time they hosted that Four Chambers Press reading."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick split dinner and to grab some sweets before a movie. Split the pork chili verde pot pie and a side of market vegetables. The pie was savory, flaky and delicious. The veggies were a blend of peppers, squash, mushrooms, sprouts ect. They were amazing. Our fav was our super friendly adorable server Katie. Amazing personality and beyond friendly. Thank you for a local place with real food and great staff."}
{"text":"Yummy food, great dessert and cartel coffee! We shared the rotisserie chicken along with a baked sweet potato (w/ chili lime butter) and the season veggies (heirloom carrots- yum!). We also used the yelp check in for a free vegan apricot and date cookie which was delicious. Though a little pricey (thought they do use a lot of local ingredients), it was a hit in our book!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and enjoyed roasted cauliflower, southwest pasta, devil fries and several appetizers.  Food is fresh.  Service a hair slow but super-nice, so who cares?  Ambience is great if you like big open space with loud talking - great for groups of friends.  Even better, nobody rushes you out, so we and several other larger groups just sat, ate and talked for hours.  Will return again."}
{"text":"I came in thirty minutes before close and received the best service - not only from my server, but from the bartender, and the manager as well. That alone speaks volumes. 

I had the pasta and it was on point, too. Definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"The vibe of Phoenix Public Market is always hustling and bustling, no matter what time of day it is! I recommend coming here to catch up with a friend or colleague while simultaneously people watching and enjoying a good meal. Don't come here with the intention of working in solitude.
Living downtown, the cafe is a hub and I am always trying to decide what fresh dish I'd like to taste next. I often see people studying the menu like it's a math book, because the meals are so hard to choose from! I personally have tried their pot pie, iced lattes, and homemade macaroons and they're all delicious! Most recently I came in on a cheat day to try their Cafe Sundae. What appealed to me the most was their use of local flavors, from the prickly pear caramel to the almond crumbs and honeycomb, too. It was constructed to be a dessert experience, and I loved it for its creativity and fusion of flavors. One of the staff members even told me she has dreams about it! (I can't help but understand...)"}
{"text":"Too loud for my  taste, this is a place  I use only to meet up with friends before going someplace else to eat. The coffee is fair. The service is usually barely adequate. This is  a place that caters to young people who think they are going someplace in. The food is of a similar ilk, barely acceptable."}
{"text":"Overall I have to say this place is a bit pricey. $6 for a small grilled cheese sandwich? Really? Don't get me wrong though, the atmosphere is nice, the prickly pear tea tastes amazing. Oh and the macaroons--scrumptious. But if you want food that will stick to your ribs and stay in your belly, look elsewhere, or you will be spending upwards of $20 here for a meal. The cranberry macaroon is my favorite flavor there, but the salted caramel ain't half-bad either. And there is glitter on them. What the what? Awesome! My friend did not really like the bread on the pulled pork sandwich, but my other friend loved the chicken quesadilla, which is a feat in itself since she is a harsher \"critic\" than I am."}
{"text":"Just walked in at 11:03 and every table was taken by a single person. We had 6 people with us and could not sit anywhere. Won't count on this place for lunch! Damn wifi hobos!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was a fantastic experience. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. The recommended their favorite dishes us. I decided to go with the southwest pasta (I think) with rotisserie chicken, pablano sauce and pico. It was great! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Adore this spot for breakfast and lunch! Stopped in for lunch and a treat with my husband and we both left happy. It has a great indoor atmosphere with a stocked pastry case, a bar and a small specialty retail area with local goods. 

I ordered the Eat The Rainbow salad with chicken, it is gluten free & vegan (without the add on of chicken). The dipping sauces it comes with are really good, and the rotisserie chicken is a must! My only wish is that my add on of chicken came with more, as the $4 add on is quite pricey for the amount I received. My hubby orded the chicken salad sandwich, it has a curry sauce on it that is not expected but great! I also got a ballerina cookie, it's made with almond flour, espresso and dark chocolate AKA the best combo. It was so soft and had the perfect amount of sweet from the chocolate and salty from the sea salt. My husband had the cinnamon roll with icing and really enjoyed it. He said it was satisfying without being too heavy. 

Service was excellent and food came out in a timely manor!  You order first, then sit down and wait for food to be brought out keeping it a casual atmosphere. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We were in town for a convention and looking for a healthy local good food option.  We found the Phoenix market cafe.  Let me say this, WOW!  Upon entering the place looked and smelled amazing.  We began with chips salsa and guacamole.  They were great. My wife ordered the power bowl kale salad with tri tip steak, I selected the tri tip with broccoli and mashed potatoes. The meat was cooked perfectly, everything was fresh and tasted incredible. If your in the downtown area this is a must visit place guaranteed to impress even the most discriminating Foodie."}
{"text":"Rolled by this place for months NEVER thinking it housed some of the most unique organic and health focused yummies ever. I always find myself ordering the chickpea pancakes because lets face it we all ask how can something so good not be so many calories! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pros: 
Private covered parking lot next to the restaurant which is a plus in downtown Phoenix. Metered parking can be annoying. Patio seating. Half of the bar is inside, half outside. There's happy hour from 3-6 for food and 3-close on drinks. Not sure what the prices are though. 

Cons: 
You order at the counter or the bar and they bring the food to your table.  Make sure someone saves your table while you're up ordering, or someone else could snatch a good seat. Several gnats and flies were after our food. 

I had the breakfast burrito. It was filled with lots of bacon. Yum. Hit the spot for a hangover LOL."}
{"text":"The staff is super nice, friendly and welcoming. However, the service set aside, the food itself is kind of a joke such as the rotisserie chicken for which you are supposedly getting a half chicken with two sides. I got the order to go and once I got home and opened the container, there was no chicken breast, only two pieces of chicken that did not represent a \"half chicken.\" for which I paid 14 dollars. The sides were quite delicious especially the steamed broccoli. I can't say that the mashed potatoes were the best I've ever had but they were passable and my dog seemed to have enjoyed them. 

Food and service aside, it was a piece of cake to park. The interior of the cafe is nice and airy and quite welcoming. For a beverage note, all I had was a latte from their Cartel coffee beans and I thought it was below average considering I had just paid a visit to Lux Central up the street.

All in all, a very nice space but in order to wow me back, the food and beverage truly need improvement. I would love to visit their Saturday morning open air market at the next opportunity."}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant, and location is perfect from downtown.  The service was great, he was super friendly and outgoing.  One item on the menu had run out for the evening, server was very accommodating to make up for this.  We went with the bbq platter that was delicious.  The chicken is so tasty.  Fresh lemonade.  Delicious"}
{"text":"We were on a Phoenix food tour. We stopped here for our last stop. We had a cookie and coffee. Both were good. The place has a nice vibe but I can't tell you much about their food."}
{"text":"The downtown fries are life. Always order them! Comes with three sauces. One is ketchup (ew) bit the other two sauces are amazing. Also all items are fresh and delicious. Their veggies and things are always fresh. The ballerina cookie is the best."}
{"text":"oh how lovely!

i saved this spot for sunday evening because of their community dinner offer. from a set menu you can enjoy a 3 course meal for only 12.99, and it's available for take out too! tho the cafe is so cozy you'd probably want to stay and chat with your party or admire the handmade bar soaps and canned sauces on your own too

i chose their chicken pasta which was fairly good; heavy cream-based with a small portion of what i assume to be their famous rotisserie chicken shredded in there. the peppers are a nice burst of sour n spicy. standard small salad to go with it. i ended up getting two of the desserts because of a small error in the kitchen, and the lady was so sweet to throw in the extra for me! it's a date cake of sorts, what you'd imagine a molten lava cake to look like. definitely would have been fine on its own as a dry cake without the sugary sauce that it ended up sitting in, but i dig the texture of it.

also got a ballerina cookie thru their check in offer, which i'd first seen, actually, at cartel coffee on 1st. salty sweet crunchy goodness the size of the moon. phoenix is doin a few important things right

thanks for your hospitality! if you're visiting like i am and need a hearty meal to enjoy on a sunday or monday evening, the public market cafe is for ya!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients. Entrees skillfully prepared. Flavorful results. I have yet to be disappointed by any menu item. This visit? The pot pie, AZ hamburger, pretzel app and cookies (free yelp promo), all great.

Twenty percent discount for students. Don't worry U of A and NAU. The discount is not just for ASU students. 

A lot of diversity in diners. Some students, some professionals. A great vibe. If you're like me, you'll forget you're in Phoenix. Don't get me wrong. I love Arizona. But it's fun to be fooled by décor and feel that you've been beamed elsewhere.

Very kid friendly. Three dollar kid's meals, with a donation going to feed hungry children in Phoenix with every kid's meal sold. How nice is that?

Dog friendly as well. We sat on the patio with our pooch in tow. Upon being seated, the waiter brought water for the humans and the canine in our party."}
{"text":"Best happy hours! 3pm - close!  How fantastic is that?!  I'm not the greatest at ordering food that is not straight forward, so i ordered a chop salad and a mint/cucumber cocktail.  At first, i wasn't too sure if i liked it or not.  But since i didn't stop to take a sip until i cleared my plate, i must have loved my salad.  Then my drink was gone.  I don't know what happened.  It was just all so good.  Everything was fresh with as much local ingredients that they could fit in.  
We went back for happy hour again today. 
Both visits we had an enjoyable time talking with the staff working the bar.  
Really looking forward to having a new hangout in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We had the 1/2 rotisserie and pork choke verde, Food was great but service was even better. Ask for Ryan he is the right amount of attentive and he describes the dishes in a way that everything sounded amazing, great experience, Thanks Ryan"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dining experience here on the day of Phoestivus. I must admit it was my first time at the cafe, but I had attended Foodtruck Friday many a times during my ASU Cronkite days. I was excited to finally try out the menu! 

I loved the pork verde pot pie - it was kind of on the spicy side, but I paired my lunch with a nice apple cider to wash it down. That's right! This cafe has a bar! Cool points again!

The vibe of the whole restaurant was like your moms kitchen back home, but run by very friendly, energetic and outgoing employees.

After finishing my lunch I was walking around taking some pictures of the Phoestivus event and some of the morning employees were having lunch. One of them named Lauren (same name!) struck up a conversation with me and offered me a bite of a croissant she just bought from the bakery. Although I was extremely full from my meal, she talked me into it! The croissant was the best thing I've ever eaten. It was flaky, buttery and delicious I was so thankful she gave me a chance to try it!

SUGGESTION: The only thing I could suggest is to have access to more restrooms during events like Phoestivus. Maybe rentals outside? There was a long line all night at the bathrooms and there was much confusion about the unisex option with customers. I heard many gentlemen say to everyone in line, \"I'm just going to go find the men's room,\" as they cut the line. It was a tad bit frustrating. 

Besides that one suggestion, which is probably only an issue during these kind of events, I loved the Phoenix Public Market Cafe and can't wait to go back to try something new and fresh!"}
{"text":"With an environment Similar to one of Seattle or Portland, phoenix public market cafe has unmatched vibe to rest of the cafe/restaurant in the valley of the sun. The place has its pros and cons to it, but overall if in the neighborhood definitely try it out. The AZ burger is quite phenomenal, green chilies and a medium cooked burger goes quite delicious with either a iced coffee and a cold pint of Deschutes."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The atmosphere is cool, occasionally overwhelming, but overall very nice. It is definitely one of my favorite places in the Phoenix area. I gave it four stars though because the service isn't very good. No one ever seems that happy and they can occasionally be a bit rude. My favorite thing so far has been their Mediterranean salad with their amazing chicken added. The biscuits and gravy and the pulled pork sandwich are also very good!"}
{"text":"Great farmers market!  The parking can be a bit scary. Avoid the dirt lot!  The food trucks are excellent!  I highly recommend going especially when it's cooler weather!"}
{"text":"If you check in here you get a FREE COOKIE!! The chocolate chip cookie was pretty good :) 

Food: 
1) Devil's scramble: DELICIOUS! Loved how all the ingredients and flavors came together. Watch out for a spicy kick!
2) Chick pea pancakes: Sounds weird, but they were so fluffy and tasty! I would have never guessed it's made from chick peas! There was a subtle grainy texture which I loved! It was really good!
3) frittata: I would have called this more of a layer of egg with cheese and veggies on top, rather an a quiche. I imagine frittatas more like quiches but without the crust, but here, they make it a little differently than that. I was a little thrown off, but it still tasted amazing, so who cares?

Ambiance: 
Very hipster and eco-friendly feel to this place. Gets busy if you come later on during the day!

Service: 
Order at the front/cashier and bus yourself. The workers there were friendly and nice!

Price: 
For the quality and taste of the food, I think they are very reasonably priced. 

Overall: 
I am really glad I found this place and I can't wait to come back and try more of their bakery and food items! Or maybe even their coffee!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have no complaints. 

Most recently, I came here for a morning coffee date with Ashley R. and really enjoyed the couple of hours we spent there. 

Ambiance: It was really cute and had a good mix of small tables, long benches, smaller couches and outdoor seating. There's some cute local(?) knick knacks for sale near the front. You order at the counters and they serve it to you there or bring your food over to you. Our plan was just to get coffee, but as soon as we saw the check-in bonus, we ended up with snacks as well. 

Coffee: I went with my go-to black cup of house drip coffee. It was smooth, and just a touch acidic. Not the absolute best coffee I've had in the Valley, but a good cup. It was decently priced, and was a great accompaniment to my cookie.

Cookie: I got the oatmeal vegan apricot cookie. It was pretty dense, but very tasty. I was looking for something that had a good breakfast cookie feel, and while this didn't quite hit that spot, it was a good cookie in it's own right. I really want to try the corn one next time.

Service: The ladies at both counters were really helpful. I wished they'd told us about the 20% off for ASU students deal though. It wouldn't have made a huge difference with our drinks, but when you're a student, every little bit counts you know? Good to know for next time!"}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised at how much I enjoyed the food here. I had the burger since they were out of the rotisserie chicken. The burger was okay but the cookies are the best. Seriously the best cookies ever. Oh the service was also great. I complained a lot and they were very accommodating"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix. Every time I come here with my fiancé the food is fantastic. This time around we split a BBQ sandwich and the burger. The burger was incredibly delicious with a great kick of heat from the peppers on top. The BBQ was delicious and very well balanced. We also split an order of the fries that were out of bounds.

This is a great place to go for a date, take friends from out of town, or get a meal where the chef clearly cares about what they serve. If you are in Phoenix and haven't tried this place yet do yourself a favor and check it out. We can't wait to get back and try more things on the menu, because all the baked goods look amazing.  5 stars well earned!"}
{"text":"My family was visiting from CA, so I wanted to try something local. I was pleased to see their menu tried to use local food as much as possible. We ordered the The Devil's Mess, The Flanched Flarney Garney, soup+salad (daily special corn bisque and Curried Chicken), BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich, a side of fries, and a side of fries. $50! That was with a small tip. Portion wise, it was slightly small, but I was okay with that since we were traveling and didn't want leftovers. I told myself it's okay to pay more money for quality food. The food was great, but not over the moon fantastic. The staff was nice and patient, especially because my daughter took a long time order. I also appreciated that they let the children sample the pulled pork.

Dessert: one daughter raved about the salted caramel macarons, but the lemon cake was meh. No frosting."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars. The food is fantastic. I'm giving it 4 stars because you have to get up each and every time you want something. Like another mimosa...."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place as much of the other yelpers, but unfortunately, it fell really flat on my list.
The place is cute, but crazy loud for lunch hour. I ordered the green chilli pot pie and was hoping it would be one of the best dishes on the menu. The crust was so hard and not crumbly. There was a lot of fatty pieces in the pork and it was not at all tasty. I only had a few bites and was completely disappointed with my lunch that I left. I don't think I will be back even if it was a short walk from where I work."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service by Sarah.  She bartends on the weekends and Tuesday. Come see her."}
{"text":"First lunch in downtown Phoenix and we decided to eat at the cafe vs the food trucks/booths at the Public Market. We were lucky enough to walk in where it wasn't too crazy. There is indoor seating and patio seating. You review the menu prior to placing your order at the counter. You are then given a number and you select your own seats. I opted to order the rotisserie chicken and fries. They have can and bottle drinks in the small fridge and if you check in you get a free cookie.

Pay attention to the cookies though. I noticed some flies swarming around and landing on the cookies. Luckily my cookie came from the bottom. I ordered the chocolate chip cookie and yum LOTS of chocolate chips like I like them. Also definitely warm it up!

My entree was super salty. The chicken had a strange taste like it was covered in bacon, but no bacon in sight. The fries were salty too. The first couple bites were OK but after a while, I had to give my meal to my friend.

What I thought was cool was that they offered sparkling and regular water (serve your own). Silverware is located on the table, but if you sit outside, you deal with the flies. It was warm out also, so if you're not used to the heat, you better make your way inside!

Service was friendly and dining here was an OK experience for our first meal in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Very nice setting. While on vacation in Phoenix, I visited this place. It has a great ambience, patio wood burning fireplace, friendly staff. Pork chili verde sandwich is the bomb! Wonderful place for lunch"}
{"text":"Great place to eat 3 meals !! I would go there everyday if I could!!  Had breakfast and lunch there on different days (frittata, pulled pork sandwich and az burger, spicy fruits, sweet potatoes) and all were delicious! There's always an interesting daily or weekly special. 

Know that this is not a full service restaurant (you need to place your order at the counter and they bring your food afterwards)... The staff are very helpful and courteous and there are many options for all types of appetites including good coffee and drinks! 

If you are downtown Phoenix, I would definitely recommend this place to eat! And on Thursdays, the open air market right next door is opened from 5-9 pm (Saturday hours vary)."}
{"text":"this was my go-to breakfast spot during my most recent trip to Phoenix. Over several visits, I enjoyed their breakfast burrito as well as a Chili Verde special, a pork bowl with tortilla on the side. Everything was delicious.  The freshly squeezed juices were a healthy choice to start the day. I did get my free cookie with Yelp check in as well. The service was fast (we got our food quickly). The space was very cool vibe, dark woody decor but also tons of natural light. Overall I'm a huge fan. All stars."}
{"text":"Took my 17 year old grandson there for lunch today and all I can say is if you haven't eaten there consider yourself lucky and don't bother. Honestly this was some of the worst food I've had in a long time and I am not a picky eater. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was floating in some pretty tasteless bbq sauce and there was at least 25% of large pieces of fat mixed in there.  With a price of $10.50 I expected a decent size sandwich but but what I got was a medium size hamburger bun that had barely any pork on it and loads of fat. Very disappointing, so I sent it back and ordered a grilled cheese sandwich.  It was totally tasteless and also very skimpy. Be real now. How do you ruin a grilled cheese sandwich?    Although it only cost $6.50 (which by the way they never even offered to refund me the price difference and I never bothered to mention it)  Any way please don't waste your money on that place it really was not a good experience and there are plenty of other really good places to eat in Phoenix.  Try the Deuce, also located in the down town area. Unique, great food and wonderful atmosphere.  We went there last week and totally enjoyed it"}
{"text":"we were visiting phoenix and stayed downtown and went to yelp to help find somewhere for breakfast. The best reviews were for Matt's big breakfast but the wait looked ridiculous so we went back to this place. It was good food, reasonably priced and very quick service. Will definitely eat there again on next weekend trip to phoenix."}
{"text":"A group of friends came here for National Margarita Day. We had guacamole, ceviche and a couple of margaritas. The guacamole was mediocre, ceviche a little bland and the margaritas were just right. The service was extremely slow and it took them a couple of times to get our order right."}
{"text":"Service really wasn't good, and that's being kind. Non-attentive, ADHD, didn't come across as happy to be there. Always a red flag when employees appear as if they'd prefer to be elsewhere. Generally too busy for my liking. Too much of a circus upon arrival and ordering was a little confusing.

Did give three stars as the pulled-pork sandwich was very good. I guess that why we eat, food. Still, as good as the sandwich was I'd avoid this establishment on a return trip to the area. Don't need the hustle and bustle for the slightly over-priced menu."}
{"text":"I have dropped in for a pastry and coffee, lounged around for breakfast, and even savored a happy hour at Phoenix Marketplace.  Always encountered Friendly service and fantastic eats! My new fave dwntwn spot"}
{"text":"What a spectacularly neat place. I first visited with a long, leisurely lunch right when they opened. Very recently I stopped in during the hustle bustle of a busy Saturday night. This place is popular with good reason! It's fun! 

Right, and the killer HH has absolutely nothing to do with it. [whistling, whistling, whistling.] 3pm to Close. 

E v e r y d a y. 
Do you like beer? Five bucks will buy you a pitcher. 

[Give me a moment before I continue.]
Pints are four bucks.
Cocktails are five.
And wine, [oh geez], house wine is five bucks.

The layout of the space is mixed, with bar top seating, couches, tables and outdoor space. If you'd like to sit at a table, be sure you walk to the *back* of the restaurant (where the pastries are) to see the hostess. 

We totally goofed and misunderstood this crucial tidbit of information. Serena, our bomb-diggity-server, came to the rescue by buying a pitcher and (!) some cookies! (We had been reseated, met a number of different servers and misplaced on the line queue. Totally our fault for misunderstanding which counter the sign up front referred to. We walked towards the bar, and a hostess seated us at a reserved table.)

None of that matters. We had an awesome time! Cookies! Beer! And really good burgers. The AZ Burger with Green Chile was delivered as requested with pinkness. Can't wait to go back! The only issue will be is the wait time. I can't imagine wanting to leave. Meh :)

Oh! Also, this place is kid friendly, with plenty of toys available for the tykes to make friends with. Oh! Oh! Plenty of parking is available.

Over and out."}
{"text":"Not that this place needs another positive review but it is by far, my favorite place to eat in the Phoenix Valley. Whether you come to eat or drink, the atmosphere is awesome. We have sat inside and outside, both are great. If you love local food, made locally, you will love this place. If you love great tasting food that is what it says it is, you'll love Phoenix Public Market. My favorite is the Tito's Cubano with fries, but everything is great. Awesome for kids too, $3 kids meals. Also, Gabby is pretty cool too!"}
{"text":"Love.... The food, the employees, the location, the menu, the concept, oh yes did I mention the food? Fresh, delicious, The Pot Pie is to die for, the Cauliflower divine.. I've eaten here, Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner and  haven't ordered anything I haven't loved..Drew, Michael, Jamal, Devin, Amanda, Lance, treat me like family.. I eat here at least once week.."}
{"text":"OK the food is actually is good, but definitely over priced: $12 for a burger and no fries and drink?  Didn't care for the hipster crowd and attitude.  The servers were slightly snotty and took their time.  Got the impression they favored certain groups, namely hipsters, over other groups, and said hipsters received more prompt courteous service."}
{"text":"Phoenix Public Market is excellent! 

The food (from breakfast all the way to dinner) is great quality and cooked with love. The rotisserie chicken is cooked to perfection, and amazingly juicy. 

One of my (I know I am a werido) favorite things about this place is that they have sparkling water ON TAP. LOOOOVVE this. 

The cinnamon roll.... to die for. 

The farmers market on Saturdays is so cool too. 

Do yourself a favor. Check out this gem in Downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I know, I know, I know... another update. I needed to update my review to update their new happy hour rules... I went here a week ago, same old happy hour, then went again Sat night.... it has now changed. The only cocktails that are 5$ for happy hour are the lee travino and the sangria.... booo. I would prefer they limit the time of happy hour and include all of the signature drinks (read: their sister restaurant St Francis' model).  I can't see spending 8$ a pop for my fave drink here (the farmer's cup) since it is small, not very boozy, and very inconsistent from bartender to bartender. I was willing to risk that it wouldn't be such a good one depending on who was working for the 5$, but not for 8. Additionally, the beers available on happy hour are limited to two as well. This doesn't make sense to me... is there really that big a difference from beer to beer in cost? This WAS my go to place in downtown Phoenix.... probably won't be anymore. If I were this cafe, I'd revamp the happy hour so it follows suit with their sister restaurant. 

PS the strawberry poptart and cheesy pretzels are still good."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a Light Rail Lunch Date with girlfriends here.  Kind servers and action packed.  I had the Veggie Rice Bowl and it was yummy!  Very refreshing for a warm day-delicious sesame dressing and crisp raw veggies.  I just wish there were a little more rice.  But from a woman who puts veggies low on the food chain-this was crunchalicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here probably 40 times in the past year.  I've never loved the dinner food; but breakfast is great and happy hour is fantastic!  The long tables are also good for meetings.

However, tonight was the end.  I sat at a table of six and those of us who arrived late were never served.  Eventually, I got a drink at the bar.... But then left.  I'm typing this review from where I went to eat instead.  Refusing to acknowledge patrons is inexcusable."}
{"text":"I love sitting at the bar when I go here. The food is amazing and the service is just as great. The guy who is always at the bar on Friday mornings is helpful and really nice. He gives great recommendations (the biscuits and gravy are addictive!) and is quite fun to look at while enjoying my coffee so thats not bad either. Definitely try the macaroons when you go in!!"}
{"text":"Really friendly, helpful employees. Amazing food - super fresh and delicious. Decor and outdoor area are fantastic, restrooms are clean and cute. Bakery has a small but tasty selection of homemade goods. I would visit often if I lived closer.  Love the community seating and carved pumpkins on the patio. Really nice lighting and ambience. Service was top notch. Definitely stop by when you're in the area - it's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Food was alright - way too pricey, not impressed with options or how crowded it was. There's so many other places downtown..."}
{"text":"Coming here a few times now this place is great.  Their food selection is interesting and delicious.  I would suggest the pork potpie.  It has a little kick of spicy flavor and who doesn't love crispy, flaky crust.  I will come back to place anytime I'm craving that potpie.  They also have great coffee and good tea choices for the summer heat."}
{"text":"Adorable and delicious! Fresh juice to the full bar and great happy hour.. Cute and delicious baked goods and yummy fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"This place is probably more like a 3.5/5 but I think I lean more towards 4 because of the consistency. Maybe it would be higher rated if they had even more healthy options....hmmmm......"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I had the roasted salmon with a rosy mule. The salmon was cooked to perfection, the mash potatoes had the perfect consistency and the vegetables were grilled wonderful!"}
{"text":"Best iced mocha I have ever had. I wish I lived closer, I would get one every day. I ordered two in the short time I spent at the Phoenix Public Market."}
{"text":"Amazing! Fresh and delicious food! Staff is very friendly! 

I was in Phoenix for four days and loved this place so much that my friends and I ate here three nights in row! 

I got the superfood salad every time. My friends ordered other items and also loved their food. The macarons are also beautiful and delicious! I wish this place had a location in my home city! 

Also, shout out to Dan for being so nice!"}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork sandwich it was excellent. My friends had the quesadilla and the Az burger and we all enjoyed our meals. Very casual , service was fast and friendly. Will be back to try breakfast."}
{"text":"We're \"too busy\" to help you\": 7pm 20 October- even though I was the only one waiting for quite sometime. Seems the word on the street from the youth we serve is true. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I first tried this during a recent Yelp event and a couple fellow Yelpers and I came back for happy hour and dinner. I just love the feel of this place; bright, wide open and different areas to sit. 

Their happy hour is daily, 3-close, $5 cocktails and mini pitchers. I enjoyed my bar drinks. I also ordered the soft pretzel with cheese dip ($3). It was okay but I think what made it lackluster was the lukewarm dip. Disappointing. I really enjoyed my pork chile pot pie ($9.50). Both of my friends ordered this too! Mine had a lot of pork in it, my friend did not have hardly any, so that seemed inconsistent. 

Other than that, I still enjoyed everything. It is a great addition to the area."}
{"text":"Great drinks at happy hour and tasty vegan options! Breakfast potatoes can be made vegan and there are plenty of vegan sides and even some pastries."}
{"text":"Great place to have a casual lunch and hang out with some friends. Plenty of space to sit inside or on the patio, even during busy lunch times. Just be aware that you may have to share a long table with another party.

It's quick-serve style, so you order what you want from the counter and they bring it out to when when it's ready. I've had a few items from here, but most recently had the cuban sandwich with fries, which was everything I had hoped for.

Plenty of parking, even on the streets with meters, if necessary."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after a long hike up South Mountain and I was more than ready for brunch!!

Yelpers:If you check in here you get a FREE COOKIE!! The chocolate chip cookie was pretty good :) 

Food: 
1) Devil's scramble: DELICIOUS! Loved how all the ingredients and flavors came together. Watch out for a spicy kick! It was cooked and made for perfection! I also had a Bloody Mary which also has a spicy kick! I happen to love spicy kicks!


Ambiance: 
Very hipster and eco-friendly feel to this place. Gets busy if you come later on during the day!

Service: 
Order at the front/cashier and bus yourself. The workers there were friendly and nice!

Price: 
For the quality and taste of the food, I think they are very reasonably priced. 

Overall: 
I am really glad I found this place and I can't wait to come back and try more of their bakery and food items! Or maybe even their coffee!"}
{"text":"This place is always great! A lovely atmosphere where you can relax for dinner or do homework - just a block from ASU's Downtown campus. The music is great too and they have great happy hour specials all for $5 too!

Brian was a great server and took care of us.

The rotisserie chicken, the downtown devil fries, and the corn bisque soup were are all incredible!"}
{"text":"I stopped here on the way to the airport.  The happy hour specials were great.  I had an awesome pulled pork sandwich.  Nice environment, music a bit loud...but really cool nonetheless.

Nice desserts too - lots to choose from - unusual for a bar.....

Bartender was great...."}
{"text":"It was less than we hoped for. Food came out cold after wAiting like 15 minutes. My pulled pork was average but I liked the bun. Fries mostly burned"}
{"text":"The food here is always fantastic...the counter people though are always borderline rude at least the times I've been there.  They've never been helpful with suggestions or answering questions.  This time there wasn't even ice, for the iced tea that had just been brewed and was very warm.  The food flavorwise was excellent though, I had a macaron and the chips with salsa and guacamole.  So I probably will keep avoiding here because I don't really want to bother the employees with doing their job."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's great for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and has a good vibe. Sure, it might be a bit $$ for some sandwiches, but I don't mind because I know they keep it local, in season, and I've had nothing but good service here. There is indoor and outdoor seating (with misters outside so get it in before the temps hit 100's) with a mix of long family style benches, regular seating, and bar seating. There are a few items for sale here, including some local olive oils and knick knacks, nothing like the old Public Market used to be, but I think that's why this place is far more successful than before. 

My favorites include the Del Real sandwich, the lentil curry coconut soup (a mouthful to say, but damn tasty), and the Mediterranean Salad. It's a solid spots for your crazy vegan, gluten, dairy free friend. Also, always ask about the special of the day. I've had some amazing sandwiches from some crazy pork belly to mozzarella flat breads. The pork chile verde pot pie is also tasty, but can sell out quick some days. 

Happy hour starts at 3PM every day and doesn't end until the places closes. That my friends, is how every happy hour should be! $5 house wines, $5 pitchers of select beers on tap (seasonal rotation) and $3 well drinks. I believe there are also some $5 cocktails as well. Basically, come after a long crappy day, get buzzed, eat solid food and enjoy yourself. 

Expect a crowd a lunch, there aren't many non-shit places downtown to grab a bite to eat, so they office drones come out in herds. Food truck Friday's are awesome, yes it can get hot as hell in the summer, but it's Arizona, go get a popsicle from a vendor and sit under the tent/run back to your airconditioned car. Wednesday nights and Saturday mornings host farmers market which is great. 

Ask for Leigh as your waiter, he's hysterical, gives great recommendations for booze and has some stories about the Galapagos."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great people and great vibe. Very busy on the Saturday with the market operating. I ordered the quinoa and eggs! DELISH. Kid friendly and loads of yummy treats to choose from!"}
{"text":"Been here many many times and never disappointed. Great staff, great food, great drinks, great cookies!! I always use my check in offer for a free cookie. 

I have been here for date night, girls night and a \"me\" night just sitting at the bar hanging out on my own. I have also brought visitors to Phoenix here several times. It has that perfect local charm and patio to impress guests. My favorite time is to sit near the wood burning fire place during the holidays. 

Everything on the menu is great, My favorite is the chicken salad sandwich!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum yum!!! I had the verde pot pie and my wife had the almond butter and jelly sandwich. We are so going back here. They have a gingerbread that I was to full to try, but we are going back for sure. This time to shop at the market and pop in for brunch. Check this pot pie out for real"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. The food is great, the prices are wonderful and the community is vibrant! 

I recommend the Downtown Devil fries, the Pot Pie (if they have any left!) and the Arizona Burger. All some of my favorites. 

Also, make sure to ask for the lemonade of the month! It's delicious every time! :)"}
{"text":"They do it right at this place. Friendly staff, delicious food, decent beer selection. For lunch, try the Cuban. I always go in with intentions of trying something new, but I always go back to the Cuban. For breakfast, biscuits and gravy please! They use chorizo gravy so it's a red color. Top it with an over easy egg and you've got the best biscuits and gravy I've found in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot one more time and was disappointed once again. I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich and I was surprised how little cheese was on the sandwich, the small size of it and the lack of taste. Had my girlfriend take a bite and her conclusion was the same.  She ordered some Devil  Fries and they were good as well as the dressing served with them. Not sure I'll be coming back after this last outing."}
{"text":"This place has delicious, fresh foods. Great macaroons. One of the best breakfast dishes to try here are the Chickpea pancakes. Sounded weird to me at first, but man oh man, was I wrong!"}
{"text":"Like I've said before; local, organic, fresh, and all natural \"life changing\" food with outstanding employees coupled with soul moving customer service makes this place a must have!!! For breakfast, try the Devils Mess or the Biscuits and Gravy with chorizo sausage. I guarantee you'll want to be a better person and outperform your staff at work!!!! 80% off your dollar stays here!! Please tip generously as the bigger the tip, the better you impact lives and win assist workers with personal enrichment!!! Breakfast, lunch, or dinner/happy hour, this place outperforms al other local cafes!!! Local beer too!!!! Live love love this place!!"}
{"text":"Tho is my go to salad every weekend. They call it \"Eat the Rainbow\"  I ask for salmon added total $20. Lot of good fresh crunchy vegetables. I eat this maybe 4 times a week here. Love it."}
{"text":"I remember the old public market grocery and café, St. Francis' restauranteurs have truly revitalized it and created a cool and ultra hip space for sipping and dining. 

First of all, killer happy hour from 3pm - close which allows you to imbibe some of the smartest crafted cocktails - Lee Trevino is my personal fave and most of the bartenders and gives nice kick of spice that I miss from often overly sweet one note cocktails. The local beers on tap change every so often. along with the awesome happy hour, it offers a great indoor/ outdoor bar which allows you to take advantage of the solid 7 hour happy hour no matter the weather.

Also, breakfast served until 3pm. Hallelujah! This place became clutch after one of those mornings where we didn't wake up for a proper brunch time but still wanted some perfectly cooked eggs and home fries. The Flanched Flarney Garney spectacularly pairs eggs, bacon, avocado, and all the other fixings into a huge, delectable, and deviously delicious breakfast sandwich. The regular menu is pretty varied and can please vegetarians and vegans alike and I have only had the sandwiches which seem to satisfy and are served with a kosher pickle and a summer slice of watermelon which means if you want side you have to add them on for an extra cost.

One thing that St. Francis' folk have done excellently in executing this revamp is creating a perfectly hip industrial yet warm and inviting space. The different levels of seating options,create an urban rustic feel make for a great place to catch up with friends, take a date, lunch with parents, or just hang solo at the bar. The outdoor with the fireplace will definitely become a highly desired spot for wine sipping during the colder months. 

One thing is the whole organization of ordering food/ beverages. The place makes it slightly confusing in how to get your full service of food and drink. If you seat at the bar you can get both but if you plan to seat yourself somewhere else you must order separately and deal with paying on separate checks. If there were some way to iron out that process this place would be almost perfect."}
{"text":"Kinda bummed that a previous Yelper said to try the mac n cheese as a side, and they don't have mac n cheese. At all.

This is a pretty cute place. They have handmade pastries (including a really good, pretzel-y cinnamon roll with cream cheese frosting) and great meals -- my boyfriend split the half-chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and fries (yes, we love carbs) and it was super filling for both of us. 

Don't go here if you want a coffee shop/restaurant to do work in. They host a lot of events and it gets very rowdy on afternoons and weekends. My bf and I thought it would be an appropriate place to do homework in at around 1 pm on a Thursday -- nope."}
{"text":"We came downtown for Food Truck Friday today to try and grab some lunch. Unfortunately, when we got there, a lack of cash (poor planning), indecision, long lines and extreme hunger lead us to head to PPM where we could pay with a card and get served more quickly. Now I wish I wouldn't have been so hangry (hungry +angry) and had waited for a Short Leash hotdog. 

We walked a few yards to PPM and I stepped up and asked for a chino salad. The dude taking our order said they were in the case behind me. I thought it was weird that they would sell you already made salads when there were fresh sandwiches coming from the kitchen but I had never been so I assumed this was just the way they operated. 

We sat out on the patio which I'll admit was nice and shaded. Phoenix is amazing in March and the weather was perfect. I opened up the salad and notice there is a huge pile of red bell pepper in the middle which wasn't listed as an ingredient on the menu. Not a big deal, really, but I happen to dislike bell pepper quite a bit. I just pulled them out and that was that. Again, not a deal breaker, but a little annoying. On the other hand, cashews (which WERE listed on the menu) were practically nonexistent. I think I found 3 pieces? Cashew are likely the most expensive item to purchase in the salad and thus, drive up the price of the salad overall. Very annoying. On the whole, this salad was plain, boring and could be made a thousand times better at home. 

To add insult to injury, TWO people eating next to us order the same salad, but it was brought to them fresh, in a bowl, and one woman even had spinach added to her salad, which I didn't even know was an option. I can't speak to the number of ingredients in their food or the taste, but it was definitely fresh made and from the kitchen, not kept in a fridge and made ahead of time. 

Now, I realized that part of the issue was my ignorance to the way this place works so I didn't complain to anyone. I don't think I was treated poorly intentionally, but even if my salad HAD been given to me from the kitchen, I would have remained disappointed with the quality being what is was. I feel doubtful about going back which sucks because I really wanted to like this place and my food :("}
{"text":"Noisy but fun.  Local beer is a good bargain, $7 for a pitcher!  Menu is a bit eclectic, but interesting if a bit pricey.  Vegetarian and vegan selections in addition to light carnivore offerings. Nice rustic decor and friendly service."}
{"text":"I am so in love with the rice bowl and garbanzo pancakes. Eat breakfast for lunch. It's just so fluffy and sweet. The bowl is on the seller side but the veggies are so refreshing and the sauce is perfect. Not too tangy, not too sweet. Just the right consistency. I also always order the chai tea. I like that it's creamier but still retains the chai. Very good."}
{"text":"Very cool place. Great food. Definitely recommend this spot here in downtown. 

Only complaint is the pulled pork sandwich didn't have the best meat to bun ratio (if you know what I mean). 

Very trendy spot though. And tasty free cookies with a check in."}
{"text":"So good!! We ordered a bunch of food and chowed down family style since we couldn't decide on just one thing. Everything was fabulous! The pumpkin bisque was out of this world! The meatloaf and mashed potatoes were delicious! The fried chicken and roasted cauliflower made it worth the trek down town and the burger was melt in your mouth good! Great service, awesome drinks, soulful live music and the chocolate cake was decadent!! We will definitely be frequenting this place!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food truck Wednesday and visiting the merchant booths with the band in the background.  Afterwards we popped inside to have a few drinks.  Their desserts are very scrumptious as well."}
{"text":"Waited for 15 minutes before anyone even noticed us waiting to be seated.  Food was moderate til I found paper in my mashed potatoes.  Best fried chicken of Phoenix - definitely not.  Get some personality for your servers and focus on good food and timely service."}
{"text":"When the D-Backs have a home game, PPMC offers a sweet deal: $8 for any sandwich or burger and a premium draft beer. You heard me right, ladies and gentlemen--only eight bucks! Just mention the special and it's all yours. I ordered the AZ burger, medium rare. It's topped with grilled peppers and they nailed the med-rare. I can't remember what beer I drank (it was a new addition; I wasn't too drunk). What a great deal! Go, D-Backs!!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go here. Today I had business in Downtown so I decided to check it out. I had been to the outside farmers market several times but never inside to this cafe. Chris was spectacular. I saw the sign that said SunDevils get a 20 percent discount so I jokingly asked if alums who are teachers could too. He jumped all over it. What a guy. The food was okay. I got a Curry chicken sandwich with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. It was good. However, even with the discount the place is pricey for lunch. How do college students afford to eat here? 

The concept and decor is great and they have a Cartel coffee bar inside which is one of my favs in the valley. For dessert I got an Expresso Macaroon since my phone died before i could cash in the free check in cookie offer. I did not think it was as good as other places that make them locally. That could have just been my own tastebuds though and no fault of the establishment. Overall a nice place. i believe I will come back again if I am in the area. I love Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great place for a morning coffee or pastry.great atmosphere and amazing muffins and cookies. Saturday's there's a market in the parking lot. Recommend coming early for breakfast and of course for some shopping."}
{"text":"We originally was planning to go to the Food Truck Friday but got there at 1:30 pm just as they were closing so we tried the Phoenix Public Market Cafe, been wanting to try it anyways.

We ordered the Titos Cubano and Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie.

Homemade Baugette was on the crunchy side but the overall sandwich was good.

The Green Chile Pot Pie was excellent,  would highly recommend this dish. On the smaller side but the beef and Green Chile is a winner. I am a big green chili lover and this combination really works well with their excellent pie crust. This is one of their signature dishes so you have to try it."}
{"text":"Meh. I was always curious about their food so my daughter and I went to get something quick for lunch on Saturday. We both ordered the grilled chese, which came with three small grapes & a pickle spear. The cheese was shredded from a bag and mostly uncooked in the center, and it was served on wheat toast that was way to dry for our taste. We paid too much money for that meal.

I like the ambiance though so I'd give it one more chance."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent. Service consistently detracts. Even when empty, I've never had a visit without a missing item or ticket time under 20 minutes."}
{"text":"It's pretty good. The food is fresh and has the impression that it's healthier for you. I've been there a handful of times- the pastries are a must. The pop tart is so good. Can't go wrong with puff pastry. 
I've had The Rachel, the turkey sandwich. It's good but nothing I would probably have a second time for the price it's at. I'm a poor college student and the food at the Phoenix Public Market Cafe is a little pricey for what you're getting, but that's because I love happy hour and that's when I eat majority of my meals- when good food is a little cheaper."}
{"text":"I'm slowly becoming more and more of a fan this place. Came here on a random Monday morning after I'd been craving pancakes and wanted a healthier choice. This time I got more pecans and the pancakes really hit the spot. Since they are so big, I was only able to eat one. I found out from the girl who cleared our table though that you are able to order a half order of the pancakes! Yay! Score for a $4 breakfast! 

In addition, I'd been having a mad craving for a cinnamon roll for the past few weeks and I was surprised when I walked in and saw them in the display case. I of course had to order one, diet be damned! It was fairly good sized and pretty good, definitely taking care of my craving!"}
{"text":"First of all, I'm not reviewing because of customer service. The staff was actually really nice! No complaints here. The whole vibe & ambiance of the cafe is great as well. No negative thing to say. If you're looking for hipster, you've found it. I appreciate that they have outdoor seating. Plenty of seating actually. But it does get buku packed during lunch. 

I'm more disappointed in the food. First off, if you purchase their chips & salsa, which runs you $7.25 for what you can get free at most Mexican restaurants, you're either an idiot or filthy rich. That's ridiculous. I can't even believe they offer that. 

But on to what we actually ordered. My sister ordered the lentil soup. She said this tasted great. The portions however were disappointing. She ordered a large. But when she went to dip her spoon in, she hit the bottom of the bowl immediately. The soup barely went over half her spoon. The bowl was \"large\" in diameter but the depth...I mean can you call that depth?! Our friend ordered a side of lentil soup & we're willing to bet that it's the exact same size as my sister's large order. Only she paid $3 for a side. 

I ordered the Roosevelt Row Bagel. It says it comes with chunky avocado. It's $9.25 but I thought, well, avocados are expensive so this is somewhat reasonable. Especially if the avocado is chunky. Tell me why they spread my avocado like we're in the great depression! Why can I see the bagel through my \"chunky\" avocado?! & why are they calling it chunky avocado when in fact the chunks were not avocadoes, they were bell peppers! 

My friend also ordered the same bagel but she couldn't get over the fact that the sprouts they came with were like ten pieces. & on top of that the hummus was salty. Hummus salty? Yes, it's possible, their hummus was salty. & you know the grapes & oranges they add on the plate? This we could not stop laughing at. How they thought four or three pieces of grape were going to suffice was beyond me. I was dying. Then I looked at my orange & saw that they basically gave me a peal! I lost it. At that point you can't help but laugh. The rest of lunch just became a roast at everything everyone else ordered. We'll give it to their chicken curry sandwich though, it was pretty darn tasty.

Look, if you come here for the ambiance or a place to study, I don't blame you. It's a cool place. But if you come here for the food, you must be out your gat damn mind. This must be the closest place to you for lunch if that's what you think. Happy hour, no questions. But full priced? Come on now."}
{"text":"Over-rated in my opinion. The food lacked flavor and uniqueness. I was hoping for more of a market experience, but it reminded me of a panera bread. Just mediocre."}
{"text":"Great bfast, great ingredients, decent prices... wonderful place, give it a shot!

Breakfast burrito is delicious, blue corn pancake is massive and is just the right amount of sweetness (not overwhelming)... Coffee is bitter (dark roast), if that's your thing...."}
