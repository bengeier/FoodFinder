{"text":"Very friendly service and they got an opening price right now! They got options like pho, laksa, and pad thai. I've had the chicken pho option and the broth was very clear and well stewed. The chicken they used was also very smooth.

It's a more focussed menu than other pho places so there's less options, but nonetheless it's got the essentials.

Get familiar with the food and the owners, they're great company."}
{"text":"Came around 12.30pm on a friday- 10 mins wait. 

Stuff is very nice. 

The staff there spoke Cantonese and English 

Hainanese chicken rice is good and came out fast. It is my favor .

The laksa and the soup was very good."}
{"text":"My first impression ... this restaurant has a strong cleaning agent smell. The chairs looked like they're salvaged from Kijiji. Nice and bright with generous seating area though.

The food is so so. Was recommended the Penang Char Kuay Teow which looks and tastes exactly like the Chinese style beef stir fry noodles with hot sauce. Definitely not genuine. The Hainan chicken is not bad if it can be cut into smaller chunks.The big chunks look a bit scary and distasteful. The beef pho was average and uneventful. I saw my neighbour eating Pad Thai which looks reddish and a bit watery. Not sure if I'll go back again.

For southeast Asian food, I prefer Bali Restaurant nearby. The food quality and presentation are much more intricately done."}
{"text":"The place is spacious and airy. The staffs are friendly and courteous. I ordered a dish that was not on the menu and they made it for me with no fuse. The Singapore style noodle came out pretty good. Will go back to try other dishes ,"}
{"text":"This is a place that I go to almost at least once a week, since they opened a couple months ago.  I am so glad I found this restaurant.  Basically this is a place that regardless of what I order from the menu, it doesn't disappoint.  A few of my favorites include: Hainanese chicken rice, Penang prawn mee noodle soup, char kuay teow, curry, grilled lemongrass chicken with rice, satay beef skews and mango salad.  Pandan kaya french toast is something that I always have even if I am already full.  The milk tea is smooth, and the strongness of the tea is to the dot, yet not bitter.  

Portion and price are quite decent.  

Every staff there is friendly and accommodating.  

Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Shortened Review 

- SUPER slow service (people got up to get their own menus and impossible to get servers attention), 15 minutes for table next to us to get tea

- decent food 3/5, fusion confusion, Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese and Malaysian food all at the same place, nothing bad but nothing great 

- fair price, small portions 

- WILL NOT COME BACK"}
{"text":"Authentic Malay Singaporean and Thai food.  My favourite is their curry chicken!  They are new but their chef isn't... excellent!"}
{"text":"Bad food experience all around.  Given they're called Mosaic Southeast Asian, we tried a few dishes from different south east asian areas.

Singapore - Singpore Fried Noodles with Shrimp
Thailand - Chicken Pad Thai
Vietnam - Beef Pho

First off, the singapore fried noodles were super spicy - as if the chef accidentally dumped half the curry powder bottle into the wok.  This was after we told the waitress to have less spicy since she said it's pretty hot.

Chicken Pad Thai - the menu says that they use tamarind.  Hell, no!  This was ketchup all the way!  Terrible pad thai, super ketchup paste red and zero authentic flavours.

Pho - MSG MSG MSG.  So much MSG in the soup you could literally smell it!

All of the mains were a miss, and in a big way.  Nothing tastes at all authentic.  None of this was good \"southeast asian\" food and there's no way I can give this place more than 2 stars.  The only thing was the service was very friendly.  However, that doesn't make up for the bad food, sorry, even with the 10% grand opening discount it was not worth it!

On the positive side, we did order mango salad and that was the only edible dish.

1.5 stars"}
{"text":"I would say 3 stars max, maybe slight under 3.

The place looks new and clean/well lit and they serve Thai/Vietnamese style food. On average, each dish you are looking at about at least $10 each.

We ordered the Hainaneae Chicken rice and the bak kut teh (???).The food services is fast. The presentation looks ok, but the taste is just average,  not the worse but not the best either. For the chicken rice dish, it's missing the (sweet) soya sauce and I find the rice abit mushy but also found some slightly burnt rice pieces in there which make some bytes more chewy and hard. In my opinion, more work needed in the rice texture itself. But it does has the chicken rice taste that u would expect from the chicken rice.

As for the bak kut teh, I find the soup abit watery than I expected and the ribs are quite dry for my palette...just average if u ask me.

\"Average\" is what I would used in describing this experience. If I am not in the neighbourhood, probably wouldn't come again. This place is about a week old so maybe still trying to get themselves oriented, hope will get better."}
{"text":"Their Kayan French Toast is the best desert I've ever tasted. Filled with sweetness with a nice custard taste inside. With nice crispy edges and a chewy and soft middle, meet the Panden Kayan French Toast, a must-try."}
{"text":"This place sits firmly at a 3.5 stars. Reason being the food was mediocre. There's no special flare from this place vs Thai basil or restoran Malaysia. I can say that their service was absolutely superb and friendly. However, food just doesn't exceed what is already available. I think I'll still be coming back as I have yet to try the other dishes. There's definitely room for growth and I can see it become much bigger than it is now. First of all, the menu is vast and slowly overwhelms you. It certainly isn't in the caliber of Congee *ahem* Queen, but still pretty bad lol I hoenslty don't have much to say as it was my first time. Perhaps I'll come by again.. In the near future."}
{"text":"Had the hainanese chicken rice, Singapore vermicelli and Tom yum soup. The soup was great, but the hainanese chicken can be more lean and authentic, while the Singapore vermicelli could use a bit less water. Place is pretty tidy and clean. I would come back."}
{"text":"Stars 3.5

Since most of the reviews looked at their Malay and Thai dishes, my hubby and I decided to try the pho for reference. 
Let's start with service. It was friendly and very accommodating to food allergies and substitutes. No extra charge!
The interior is quite nice. It's relatively new so everything was fairly clean. The space was nice as well. 
The food was pretty good. We ordered one beef pho with tom yum gong soup (8.50)and one large beef and beef ball pho in beef broth (9.50)
They use fresh rice noodles vs the dry noodles so they tend to be a little softer. 
The meats were marbled beef slices and very tender. The beef balls were nice and bouncy. 
The beef broth was light. Not too salty or over powered with spices pretty yummy. The tom yum gong was a bit on the more sour side than a mix of spicy and sour. The red oil on the top would lead one to believe that it's more spicy than it really is. With addition of raw beef it was a nice soup. 
We also ordered an avocado smoothie (4.95) and a lime soda was 3.95. A little much for soda water and lime. 
What brought my rate down from 5 to a 3.5 is the size vs the price. The price is similar to other Vietnamese restaurants but the size wasn't what you would pay for. The large look similar to a regular sized one at other places. Also the amount of noodles seemed similar to the regular one I ordered. The regular was pretty average size. So if your hungry you may want to order a little more. 
All in all a good experience. We'll be back."}
{"text":"3.5 to 4 for food, and 4.5 for service.

***Yelp has 10% off when you check in***

The food is decent, although not as good as the go to place at Brimley and Sheppard, but for people living uptown, it is a decent choice for South Asian food. I will definitely be back since me and my friend live uptown.

The service is good and they do try to accommodate customer needs and request, the owner also chat with customers to see what they can improve, definitely a good attitude to bringing people back.

We tried Penang curry which Juu T. recommended, which is correct, the curry is pretty good, the flavor for curry is on the heavier side with lots of herb and spices, it is not very hot so it should fit most people's taste, strong flavor is perfect for mixing with rice, it was the first dish we cleaned up.  I even ordered a take out for my girlfriend.

The Hainan Chicken and rice is pretty good, it is better taste and much less MSG than Phoenix which I appreciate, the flavor is on the lighter side.

The Laksa noodle is a mix of vermicelli and egg noodle, the soup is not heavily flavored, I do find it ok, but if you prefer strong flavor, I would recommend you try other dish.

We will be coming back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Richmond Hill! Newly opened restaurant with Thai and Vietnamese food. My friend and I tried their mango salad, laksa noodle soup, and pineapple fried rice. All dishes were flavourful. I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Came here with my coworkers for their lunch menu hoping to support a new business in the area. Was terribly disappointed and will never come back.

Pros:
- Good lunch menu price
- New restaurant so it looks clean

Cons:
- Terrible service (forgets things and not proactive on refilling the teapots)
- Stingy on meat portions, they try to fill up their dishes with only rice and noodles
- Table does not come in condiments / chili oil
- First Markham place food court would taste better than this place

If you're looking for south East Asian food in Markham/Richmond hill, don't come here. You're better off going to lemongrass or other pho restaurants."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday evening and half of the tables were reserved.  Maybe that boosted my expectation.  

Chicken skewers (3 / 5) - lacking some flavours But tender.

Laksa (2 / 5) - again, lacking some flavours.  I found the instant one with a black package taste better than this one. 

Singapore chicken rice (3 / 5) - the chicken was boneless, which is a plus, but it wasn't juicy enough.  The rice was a bit dry and no chicken oil flavour.  

Overall, the food was just OK.  Staffs were nice and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch at around 12:10 with my colleagues and it was already pretty packed, with a regular flow of people coming in. 

I got the laksa lunch combo for $9.95. It's not really a combo since it doesn't come with anything else... Have to pay an extra $1.50 for a drink. Flavour was decent, but on the lighter side. Comes with a fair amount of toppings and it was filling. I wish there was more soup though, as the bottom parts were a little grainy and was too little for the amount of noodles. My friend ordered chicken Pad Thai. I tried a bite and it seemed pretty good... the noodles were not too soggy or dry. Flavour wise, also a bit on the lighter side. 

The only real compliant I have is that it was super slow! There are two servers who were nice, but seemed a little inexperienced. Makes sense since the restaurant is relatively new I guess. Took just under 5 minutes to seat us (there were two empty 6 people tables at the time and we were 4). The food took around 20-30 minutes to come out. We heard some other tables had already waited over 30 minutes. Our bill took another 5 before we decided to just go up and pay to avoid being late for work. 

Hopefully they'll be able to improve on this as they gain more experience. I'd suggest only coming here when you have time to wait, and perhaps not during lunch hour!"}
{"text":"Been here 3x since they opened, service is consistently friendly even during busy lunchtimes and that always increases the chances of my repeat business :)

* Penang Char Kuay Teow: Generous takeout portion, shrimp was nice & firm but flavour was so-so.

* Belacan Okra: Surprised to see it was cut lengthwise, thought it might be \"old\" okra, but I was wrong. It was cooked well, not tough and very tasty. 

* Singapore Laksa: Best of the 3 dishes I had ordered. Mee & Mee Hoon noodle mix, accessorized with tender, juicy pieces of chicken + 2 beautiful shrimp + half egg + fish cake + bean sprouts. Gravy was so good I broke my own rule and drank too much of it. The only thing that was missing / weak was the Laksa leaves (but that's hard to get here so I would be nit-picking). 

Friday peak lunchtime = almost all tables occupied but my food still came out after a decent wait.

Free WiFi (password is their phone number). 10% Discount automatically applied. Owner / Manager invited me to give direct feedback so they can improve. Brownie points for good attitude!"}

{"text":"Definitely a bit of a surprise. At the edge of Beaver Creek, it's the only Asian restaurant in the mall when there is usually a dozen. I ordered one of my favourites, the green beans with minced pork.  The beans were crisp and sweet, perfectly cooked and the rest of the flavours were excellent. 

I need to try out more if the menu. I suspect I will be pleased!"}
{"text":"Came around 1pm on a Thursday- seems that this time of the day is their 2nd lunch rush. 
They seem a bit new and not completely organized yet for the busy lunch hour but you can tell that they have positive attitudes and are trying- which is encouraging. 

The staff there spoke Cantonese and English, but I was there looking for a good lunch, not rating on authenticity- after all, the store name is \"mosaic\". 
My iced lemon tea came first- it came without ice. I did not want to be one of those customers that don't give them a chance to fix the issue, so I asked for a glass of ice and they brought it out right away without giving any sort of judgement or attitude. I used to work in a restaurant, so I can sense these things. This to me is a +1 for service. After I got the ice, it was a perfectly good iced lemon tea. 

Hainanese chicken rice - any time I hear that they have a boneless version on the menu, I feel obligated to try it. My current benchmark in the GTA for a standard chicken rice is Phoenix. I would have to say that the skin was a little fatty here and the meat wasn't as smooth/juicy, but it was still tender. Also, the pieces could be cut smaller. I would still come back for the chicken rice if I'm in the area. 

I don't have as much experience in the laksa department but the soup was enjoyable, however they use a mix of egg noodles and vermicelli rice noodles- I'm not a fan of vermicelli so I'd only ask for egg noodle next time. The one other positive thing was the shrimp in the soup was actually good- most of the time it tastes like nothing and has lost all of the shrimp texture. 

I'd probably come back for my hainanese chicken fix- maybe I'll try curry next time?"}
{"text":"Great food and Service. My wife and I will definitely be back! I highly recommended this restaurant."}
{"text":"Speed read.
1) Hainan chicken - OK
2) Singapore Lasa - Missing some herb.
3) Beef Curry - taste like it has been overly soften and ruined the beef texture.
3) They try to be too many things.

I think they try to be too many things, Malay, Thai, Viet.
The 3 dish we ordered, the only one we like is the Hainan Chicken.

Laksa has the basic flavor of coconut, curry, and the spicy taste, but it's missing some herb to generate the kicks.  The Laksa soup did not blend in with the noodle of the other ingredient.  It seems like everything was cooked with boiling water, and it's tossed into the soup.  

Hainan Chicken is good, soft and tender.  It's comparable to Golden Phoenix Hainan chicken on their good day.  The rice is not too oily, and tasty.  They didn't go overboard with the chicken oil.
A couple things would enhance this dish.
1) A slight coconut flavor on the rice
2) Select chicken with better chicken taste.

Beef Curry - we didn't like the beef texture, as it seems to be over marinated.

All in all, other than Hainan chicken, I would not recommend the other dishes."}
{"text":"Heard that they have good hainan chicken and came to this relatively new restaurant.
Not a long wait for a nice sunny Sunday afternoon.
A large party left and so they were cleaning up a lot of tables.
Not a huge restaurant but feel spacious.
The menu has limited choices. No afternoon combo. Prices are not too high. About $11-$15 per dish.


We ordered one hainan chicken and one lemongrass pork chop rice and tornado rolls (5 mini pieces). 

Tornado rolls ($5.99)were really quite mini and it's soooo oily that it's dripping. Tasted ok. Not special.

Hainan chicken ($10.95?) was underwhelming. Good chicken flavor but the texture wasn't great. Although not mushy, it was quite soft. Anyway not a big fan. That hot sauce and the soup on the side was ok tho. Rice was too hard to my liking. 

Lemongrass pork chop ($10.95?) was really not great. Waited a bit before it arrived and really wanted to have some nice pork.
But it was two small pieces, thin, tough, dry, no lemon grass flavor, burnt..... rice again was so hard.

I probably won't return. If I'm craving for Thai/Vietnamese I will go to lemongrass or nam nearby. You'll get more bang for your buck. 
One star was for the service which was not bad as they had good attitude. yet to be improved since they were still trying to manage the crowd and all that."}
{"text":"Hainan Chicken Rice - the rice and sauces were ok, but the chicken was very bland.

Stir-fried Gailan vegetables - the flavour was good, but too much MSG and the veggies were a little too tough.

Beef Pho - the noodle was good. they seemed to use brisket for the rare beef. The soup was too salty and very dark, not clear at all. 

Maly Curry Beef Rice - it was pretty good, just the rice quality was poor.

This place is pretty nice. But for their price, there are other better tasting alternatives nearby. It's a competitive marketplace."}
{"text":"Visited this new restaurant Monday night with my parents.  We ordered the Hainan chicken rice, Malaysian curry beef, lemongrass pork chop rice.  

Hainan chicken rice was not as good as I expected.  The chicken had no taste, plain steamed, the rice not enough chicken oil and coconut taste.  The Malaysian curry beef was not bad but too much potatoes and not enough beef for the price of $13.95 is really not worth it.  The lemongrass pork chop rice was pretty tasty.  In the end we also ordered a 3 bean mixed drink, the size and quantity of the drink really not worth $4.99 as well.  Overall this new restaurant is very costly, and food quality not meet the pricing."}
{"text":"The place is fairly new so I have only eaten here once. We ordered the Hainanese chicken and curry laksa, I also ordered a coconut red bean drink because of recommendation from the owner I think.

The plaza is a little hard to find parking during lunch hours. The restaurant is roomy, bright and comfortable. I think it use to be a chinese bbq restaurant called kung fu chop chop! LOL. The decor didn't change much from then. Look like a hk style cafe.

The food is good, at least the stuff we had was fine. Laksa was flavourful and tasty. Hainanese chicken is just ok, the chicken is a little over cooked. Good hainanese chicken should have smooth, tender and moist texture. The chicken oil rice is tasty though. The drink is more like a dessert than a drink, I couldn't figure out how to drink it with a straw so the owner/waitress had to show me. Apparently you had to smash and mix it with the spoon first. The glass became half full after it's mixed! Where did half my drink go!? LOL....

There are plenty of items on the menu, I will go back to try other items. Worth taking a look!

{"text":"This is a very new restaurant. The flavors were on point!
I ordered the Singapore Laksa, Chicken skewers, Hainanese chicken rice and the Char Kway Teow. All very nice! I will be going back to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"3.5 - 4 stars. I've been here about three times for dinner, and I enjoy their food and quick service and have always left with a happy stomach. So it surprises me how empty it was on a week day night...

The MUST TRY dish here is the penang curry, and the price varies by the selection of either chicken, beef or shrimp. The penang curry has a red curry base, spices, coconut milk, thai basil and peanuts. It's flavourful, sweet but has a kick to it, and it's good with rice or roti. 

For dinner, they have these 4 and 6 people set dinners. We've tried the 6 people dinner for $98, and it came with an appetizer platter, curry, Malaysian sauce with gai lan, grilled pork chops, hanianse chicken and pineapple fried rice. Overall, everything tasted great and definitely worth the price - I'm only going to go into a detail for a few:
-   Appetizer platter: Satay beef (6) and chicken (6) skewers, shrimp crackers, spring rolls and shrimp rolls (6) - the beef was juicy, and they use an entire shrimp (not frozen!) 
-   Grilled pork chops (6 pieces): When I first saw them, I was kind of worried it'll be overcooked and hard to bite. However, Mosaic had tender pork chops. 
-   Curry: The original set dinner came with malay curry with beef but the owner allowed us to switch to the penang curry with chicken instead. 

Would I return? Yes - I would still like to try their soup noodles/pho (and perhaps I will update my review after that :P). 
Note: The 10% off yelp offer is only valid for a la carte orders."}
{"text":"First time to this new restaurant, we decided to try and see if they get the basics right: pineapple fried rice and chicken pad thai. The fried rice was okay but we didn't like the pad thai, it was way too ketchup-y and sweet. I wouldn't say the food is bad, but it wasn't really good enough for me to want to come back either, and especially when there are better options for the same type of food nearby (i can think of at least 2 restaurants that are much better within a 10 mins drive from this place) so... I don't really see myself coming back.

Btw, the food took quite a while as well and considering the restaurant wasn't even half full when we were there, it didn't help with the experience."}
{"text":"Quiet little restaurant and a welcomed addition to markham area as there are not a lot of viet and thai cuisine.  

Once you've entered the restaurant, i must say this i where the stars started getting deducted.  They had 2 or 3 staff but mostly situated in the kitchen.  With only 2 tables of diners, it still took several minutes before a staff seated my family of 4 and another min or 2 to bring menus (no tea nor utensils at this point).  Since it was my first time here, it did take a while to go through the menu which descriptions can be improved on if the restaurant owners expect diners to self select without inquiries (eg curry beef = curry brisket and red curry beef = red curry sliced flank beef) .  None the less, the selections all looked good so we ordered the hainan chicken (yelp recommended), penang curry chicken (yelp recommendations), curry beef, pork chop rice.   I would definitely recommend the pork chop rice which was flavourful and pork was just juicy enough.  Hainan chicken... could be better.  Perhaps it was a different type of chicken used but the colour and flavour typical of the dish was not there.  Penang curry chick was good but again could be improved.  Spice level is a mild to medium which should have been hot.  Portion and ratio between ingredients to sauce was lacking but i still liked the dish.  Curry beef, again could be improved.  I don't think it was packaged curry but the taste was very similar.  Portion size was good and lots if potatos.

Would i try this place again?  Likely yes but not until the business matures a bit.  Did not like that the staff rarely came out from the kitchen and when they do, doesn't matter how you wave, you will never get their attention even if you were sitting in their line of sight."}
{"text":"2.5 Star (Since I am reviewing base on my one and only lunch experience, maybe I just ordered the wrong dish?)

I did not expect much even before visiting Mosaic Southeast Asian as restaurant serving such a big menu (Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and even Vietnam?) usually means they would not excel in all their offerings. I was hoping Mosaic would have proved me wrong........

Coming here for lunch late afternoon, service was fast. 

Lunch menu is reasonably priced with offerings starting at $8.50.

Lunch Special: ????? Char Kuay Teow ($9.95) with Lime Soda ($1.50)

Sadly this is not a good take of the national favourite dish in Malaysia and Singapore. No caramelization from the hot wok and the dish was served lukewarm. The flavour of belachan was lacking. I just feel like packing up the whole order to microwave it at home at least the bean sprouts wouldn't be raw and tasted grassy anymore. The only good thing is the generous portion but is it a bad thing if the food is meh?

Maybe a pass for me. But if you are into less strong and bold flavours, you might enjoy Mosaic Southeast Asian's offerings."}
