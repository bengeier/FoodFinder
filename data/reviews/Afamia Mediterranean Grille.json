{"text":"Fantastic and healthy Mediterranean food. The Kafta kabobs were very tasty as was the hummus. Portions were generous and prices very reasonable. Probably the best Mediterranean restaurant in the South Hills."}
{"text":"I placed an order online. Was contacted 30 minutes after the order was placed by Eat24 and was informed that they were unable to contact the restaurant and my order was cancelled. But best of all,  my credit card was already charged and I was informed it would take up to 5 business days to refund my money. So no food and no money. First time trying this restaurant and placing the order through yelp. Won't be doing either again."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful meal there.  Staff was courteous and pleasant.  All ingredients were fresh.  I don't understand the \"harassment\" comment.  Owner speaks little English and other worker studying to be a priest. Most people would report it to the police instead of taking the time to write a review on Yelp.  Unless, of course, they are the nearby competition."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in Pittsburgh. Everything is made fresh daily by owner from Syria- nicest guy you'll meet! He makes sure everything is up to par and fixes anything if it isn't. We had a very nice waitress who was super attentive and refilled our drinks often. The Falafel and hummus here are the best i've ever tried. I can't even buy store bought hummus anymore! When Afamia first opened, they ran out of falafel one day (this hasn't happened again since, and I go here often) so I went to Aladdin's across the street. There, for around $8 I got a falafel pita which was probably about 2/3 the size of Afamias falafel pitas, which are a dollar cheaper!! The falafels were small and not flavorful- I couldn't even finish it after tasting Afamia's lol. You can tell Afamia's food is made with real ingredients not frozen like Aladdins. Since the food is made fresh, it sometimes can take a little bit long if you're dining in but nothing too crazy. I've heard delivery takes longer but every time i've taken out, the time they tell me it will be ready is always pretty accurate (give or take five minutes). If it takes longer than the owner told you, he usually throws in a free dessert which he's done a few times even though the order wasn't late! The decor in the restaurant doesn't seem very Mediterranean, but it is always very clean and the food is spectacular. Nice new bathrooms and a large sitting room in the back. I used to always go to Aladdins- but since this place opened I don't think I ever will again. Definitely try this place out if you're in the area-you wont be sorry!"}
{"text":"The food is delish! The service, not so much. We ordered 2 apps and 2 meals. We got one app, then waited a while, then the second app and one meal came out together. Then we waited some more and then the second meal finally came out. Kinda strange but like I said, the food is very good. Recommend the garlic sauce!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery twice in the last two weeks. First delivery Finally arrived after multiple calls. Today, placed a delivery order st 5:30 pm. Multiple calls, from both myself and EAT24 staff. Despite being assured several times my order was being delivered. It never was. Inexcusable. Beware."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Friendly service and the owner/chef was so accommodating they actually made us some hot food right at closing time.  We arrived late to our hotel just up the road and were looking for a light meal.  We are so glad we happened into this gem.  If you are staying at the hotel in Mt. Lebanon make sure you stop in here--you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food is good. IF it arrives in a timely manner (not likely). Don't believe them if you call about the status of your order, they lie. The first pic is of the Sleek salad. About 3/4 cup for $6. Worth it? No. This entire order was  $25. The hummus, kibbeh and desserts were freakin amazing. If they could deliver in a reasonable amount of time, I could forgive the other deficiencies...like the lack of food for the money."}
{"text":"Stopped in and got some falafel. It was very good. Haven't had opportunity to try anything else but if the falafel is any indication I am sure the rest of the food is great too."}
{"text":"Don't get the chicken shawarma. Don't do it. Unless you like eating leather. I made the mistake of getting the chicken shawarma and it ended up being a waste of money because I had to throw it all away. It was so incredibly dry and chewy, as if it was cooked in the dehydrator. It might as well have been chicken jerky. I was so disappointed with the chicken. However, my sides of tabouleh and baba ganoush were decent, tasting relatively fresh. 

Unfortunately, the service wasn't great during my visit either. The wait time was longer than they estimated and there seemed to be a lot of confusion when placing my order. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Just visited for the first time. We really enjoyed the food. The Falafel was a most, had tried nothing like it before. Kibbeh was so tasty worth the perfect spice."}
{"text":"Afamia made a terrific impression for the 2016 Taste of Lebo competition! Instead of offering a bite of just one menu item, Afamia produced a spread - 2 kinds of hummus, 3 kinds of rice, salads, as well as the day's best bite by far, a generous portion of chicken shwarma.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great, fresh Mediterranean food and super friendly service! Definitely a return visit is called for..."}
{"text":"Such a find!!!  Was looking for some take out close to our hotel and hit the jackpot. Food is amazing!  Schwarma is so flavorful and the baba ghanoush is awesome. Some of the freshest most flavorful Mediterranean food of recent memory. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This place was really fantastic. It was a tiny bit slow, but the food was AWESOME. We went without my toddler, but I think he would have liked it. I loved how you could pick from a huge array of sides / salads to go with the main meats. The lamb was perfectly cooked, and my husband devoured his roasted chicken. The hummus was on point. Recommend!"}
{"text":"We stopped In here for lunch today to check out one of the \"hot and new\" places to open.
It's in Mt. Lebanon, right across from rolliers. It's a Mediterranean restaurant with a dinning area in the back, and seating o the front. 
I had the falafel pita sandwich with fresh hummus and my wife had the tabouli salad. Both were outstanding!
The sandwich was fresh and one of the best I've ever had. The salad was also fresh and delicious.  They also have a large deli section for take out and all food can be ordered to go also."}
{"text":"My family loves Mediterranean food and we're always looking to find great places.  Afamia opened up recently and we got take out on a Saturday night.  It was probably the best Med I've had.  The chicken kabobs were juicy and full of flavor, the sleek was made with kale and the texture was perfect, the mujadara was excellent, the grape leaves delicious, as was the hummos, and you could see the eggplant in the baba ghanoush.  Best Mediterranean I've had in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"I ordered from the menu and was told one thing and it was something else. The waitress apparently didn't know her menu and blamed me. Then she said as I bite into the salad. Oh this isn't yours and thrown it away in the garbage. I'll never ever go back."}
{"text":"I placed my delivery order through Yelp Eat24. I ordered French fries, lentil soup, a spinach pie with feta cheese, the Mixed Grill with Kafka, Shish Tawook, sholoska salad, & rice pilaf. The order came with pita bread. Everything was delicious! The food was delivered about 15 minutes early & the portion size was large. I will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"If you have time to kill, maybe give this place a try? Definitely not a workday lunch time possibility. 

I went in on a weekday on my lunch hour. I usually pop into The Simple Greek next door, but I'd been curious about this place, and I find Aladdin's to be meh, so I thought, what the heck! Let's give it a go...I got back to work 10 minutes late and starving. 

There was only one other table, a couple, seated when I arrived. Not in any way busy. Once I said it was an order for here, I sat down and the server brought me over a menu. I ordered the kafta pita sandwich and  waited.

And waited.

And waited.

Two tables were seated after me, and one table of two was brought their food ahead of me before I finally gave up and left. The faces of the other patrons looked impatient as well. I kept thinking that it had to be any minute now, so I stuck around longer than I should have. Once the other table was delivered the food that I thought was mine, I went to the counter to ask how much longer it would be. They had just put the meat on the grill for my sandwich.

After waiting 40 minutes, for a sandwich, I left, telling them I really had to go. The servers apologized.

It's a family run business, and while they may make good food (which I can't comment on--it did smell delicious) they clearly have no idea how to run a restaurant. The cooks working the grill were taking the tickets out of order and did not look at all like they were trying to be efficient. One cook came back from his lunch and was offering samples of some kind of meat to the servers and other cooks, in front of the dining area, where their patrons were waiting...not so patiently at this point. The *teenage* server was trying to keep them on task and explain that people were there on their lunch and they needed to speed up. I appreciated her efforts, at least.

MAYBE I'd stop in again when I have a couple hours, but otherwise for Mediterranean type food, I'll stick to the place next door."}
{"text":"The food is so delicious. Service is hit or miss, but the food more than makes up for it. I recommend the chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that the staff was friendly...very friendly. Frankly, she was giving the food away so my party could sample everything. We had to politely ask her to stop as we were getting full beyond reason. The space is a combination of fast casual with a dining room in the rear. The menu is exactly what one would expect from a Mediterranean restaurant. The South Hills must have one heck of a huge population of Mediterranean's because Washington Road in Uptown Mt. Lebanon has three eateries within a 1 minute walk of each other! The food at Afamia was very fresh. I had falafel, baba and lentil soup. The falafel was more cake-like than I have ever had. It's a twist from Aladdin's, Najat's or Pitaland. I prefer a more 'meaty' falafel. The baba was exactly what baba should be...smoky eggplant flavor. No complaints. The lentil soup had high lemon notes which was welcome on a cold winter day. All in all a solid place, that has a standard menu and daily specials. Competition on Washington Road is fierce due to having so many Mediterranean joints selling such similar items. I wish them all well as each is delicious. I just hope they can all enjoy a profitable slice of the community's eat out budget..."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food ever!  I lived in DC and never found better than this.   Spicy hummus is on point!"}
{"text":"This place has the greatest Mediterranean food. Hands down best hummus. The staff is very friendly. It takes some time, but it's not supposed to be fast food... Not to mention that it's well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"A nice new restaurant in the neighborhood with authentic mediterranean food.  we ordered at the counter and our food was then served to us.  A small dining area in the back and some tables in the front by the counter and display area.  Some of the food is similar to next door at The Simple Greek,which is good too.  
My Beef and Lamb Shawarma was OK but the meat had little taste and was overcooked.  Simply a pita wrap with tomatoes, pickles, onions Tahini sauce with some lamb & beef."}
{"text":"Had high expectations but unfortunately I was underwhelmed. Let me first say the people are very friendly. I will prob give a second chance but will be a while before I go back to give them a chance to work out the bugs. I ordered the lamb shwarma sandwich. The lamb was VERY dry, like it was over cooked and sitting too long also. I ordered the sauce ( tahini ) on the side and they didn't include it in my order at all."}
{"text":"Afamia is located right next to the Mt. Lebanon indoor parking garage. I arrived shortly after 11 which is the time they open M-F. I saw a display of Middle Eastern baked goods along with a see through glass of the food they offer. Since this was my first visit I asked to eat in the dine in area. They have two areas. One is on the right hand side across from the ordering counter and then there is a larger one in the back.

I sat down and a very friendly waitress named Danya took care of me. She gave me a menu which I could keep and asked if I had any questions. I was grateful she took the time to go over it so I could order. I decided upon the chicken Shawarma entree. This entree comes with a choice of salad, one side and fresh pita bread. She told me that I could choose an appetizer for my side so I chose the baba ghanouj.  She then said it would take about 15 minutes.

I got my meal fairly quickly and although the chicken shawarma was supposed to come on a skewer it was sitting on a bed of rice. It was accompanied by a garlic sauce which helped because parts of it seemed a bit dry so I used the dipping sauce to flavor it. The baba ghanouj is roasted eggplant blended with Tahini, garlic, and lemon. It had a different taste to it but worked well with my pita bread. Portion sizes were generous. 

For my salad Danya recommended the Tabbouli so I went with that it was was very good. They offer refillable soft drinks or if you prefer bottled beverages. While I was eating I perused the menu. They have one page devoted to vegetarian dishes which are listed on the menu. The menu also said they are open for breakfast featuring coffee and breakfast pastries.

When I had completed my meal I asked Danya about their hours. I learned they are open M-F from 11-8, Sat from 11-11, and Sun from 12-8. I asked for my check and then learned that I pay at the counter. Apparently with this being my first visit I was unaware of the fact that your order first and then they bring the food to you if you are dining in.  Danya made my visit feel very welcome and asked me to return. I told her would to sample their desserts.

My true rating for this place would be 3 1/2 stars only because some of the chicken seemed a bit dry. They also have carry out and catering service available. My favorites however, were the salad and the baba ghanoui. Entree prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Very impressed!! The Chicken shawarma sandwich is the real deal!! Get your pita bread toasted, it's key. Huge portion for a great price, and owner even threw in a sample of his freshly made baklava. Delicious! Would highly recommend this Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing Mediterranean food. My favorite dinner place in Pittsburgh!! Most hospitable waiters, and boss is also very kind!! Highly recommend the falafel . Also the spicy hummus is to DIE for!"}
{"text":"Great food delivered right to my door in less than an hour!! What more can you ask for? 
I have not been to the actual restaurant, it is definitely one of the best place to order delivery I've ever seen."}
