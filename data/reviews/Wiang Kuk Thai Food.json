{"text":"This is by far one of the most authentic Thai /Lao spots in the GTA. And take it from me, someone who's from that part of the world. The Lao sausage, beef jerky, and papaya salad are to die for, just like how Mama used to make it!   They also make some really good authentic Laotian dishes such as Nam, Kao boon (spicy noodle soup), and of course sticky rice.  Prices are great for food court food. Everything is made fresh to order. I'm just hoping they open up more locations!"}
{"text":"Tastes like the mom and pops restaurants on Thailand. Fresh ingredients, authentic taste, clean beautiful presentation at a bargain price. My favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Excellent food here, probably one of the best of Thai noodle dishes I've had in a while. Very friendly workers too. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are frequent customers of First Markham Place food court. We normally eat at Chinese BBQ or Korean soup place. We saw this new Thai food place and decided to try them out. I ordered Bamboo Beef Soup and my wife had Pad Thai. My soup was tasty and the beef just melts in your mouth. My wife's pad Thai was amazing. We went back last week and had their papaya salad, Bangkok chicken and Coconut noodle soup. All were good dishes, the flavour was so different. Apparently everyone in the entire kitchen were from Thai. I spoke to the order taker and she said their food is cooked the traditional Thai way and the flavour is made for Thai people. It is refreshing to see Thai food restaurant owned by Thai (not Chinese or Vietnamese), does not taste like Chinese food, and unique food on the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious! Nice spice and flavor. Got takeout food and will definitely be going back! Mango salad, spring rolls, coconut Thai soup, green curry and pad Thai were all yummy!"}
{"text":"Tried the pad thai and it was very good! Try the 3 chilli one, it was spicy and delish at the same time! :D  The price was very reasonable and the portion was fulfilling. Would definitely recommend this place to our friends."}
{"text":"Great food, generous portions and very well priced. Love this place! Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai Isaan and Lao food. Good if you are familiar with and enjoy the real taste. I am always hesistant when trying \"Thai\" restaurants in Toronto, they are either chinese disguised as Thai or Thai food that has been westernized for local taste. I tried WiangKuk after hearing the staff speak Thai. Having recently lived in Thailand for 5 years, I can say that WiangKuk does offer real Thai taste.  The food is excellent value, food court prices and good quantity. I ordered the Som Tam (Thai papaya salad) and its the most authentic som tam that I have ever had in Toronto. They also have \"larb\", chicken salad (I think thats how they named it), which was also very good. The red curry is beautifully done and taste good as well. And they have sticky rice!!! The dissappointment for me was the pad thai, it tasted ketchupy and noodles were clumpy. Great food with great value however since it is rather authentic, it may not be for all taste....my cousin didnt like it although I did tell her her food tatsed like it would in Thailand."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! Quick, friendly service and awesome food. Came to First Markham to get something to eat, had just arrived in Markham for a mother-daughter foodcation. Yes, we drove 4 hours to eat and grocery shop for authentic ingredients! Ordered the Coconut Noodle Soup (Mee Kaathi) Crispy Rice Salad, spring rolls and a Lemongrass Pork Chop combo.  The Crispy Rice is awesome! Crispy, fragrant with garlic, lime leaves, cilantro and little juicy bits of sour pork sausage! The textures and flavours are fab. LOVED the coconut soup, but literally everything was so delicious. Might go back tomorrow to try more items!  Price was dece, $31.00 for the above order and bring cash, even though there was a sign I totally blanked and forgot! I was too hungry!  Highly recommend this lovely Thai/Lao place!"}
{"text":"This is probably my first time eating at the First Markham Place food court. Not a bad experience.  Thai coconut noodle soup ($6.95 and includes a tea) - I love the soup base! The perfect level of spiciness and not too salty. It has a strong coconut and curry taste. I didn't really like the type of noodles they used, the fresh or dried pho noodles would've been better. I liked the minced pork, it gave me a feeling of home. But I just couldn't stand the smell of the tea it came with.  Pad Thai with shrimps ($9.50) - The taste is very similar to the one at Congee Queen. Again, the same type of noodles as the Thai coconut noodle soup. A little on the wet side. I would say this is the typical pad Thai in Toronto but at a lower price.  Overall, 3.5 stars. Very good value and big portions."}
{"text":"I got the mango salad ($3.95 -they didn't charge tax) and they gave it to me in a bigger takeout box/portion than what I expected. It took them around 5 minutes to prepare the salad, so I believe they prepared it in the spot. It's always awesome when the food is fresh!"}
{"text":"Got the vegetable pad Thai, was $10 including tax.  They forgot to give me the free drink with the combo. Was supposed to get an ice tea. I got takeout so I only found out when I got home. I told them to put it in the bag.   Pad Thai was ketchup based, you could taste the tomato sauce/ ketchup. Which is the cheap way to make pad Thai. The noodles were stiff, and there was very little egg.The pad Thai I get from Thai restaurants and even chinese restaurants are better. They aren't this sweet and noodles are softer, more food (chicken/shrimp), more egg and free drink. Their sauce is not made from ketchup. So, this tasted weird to me.   Won't be going again, I thought it would be cheaper being a food court but it was just as expensive. If it was cheaper I'd go when I needed a quick cheap pad Thai. Also this is for a vegetable pad Thai for $10. Usually it's $10 for a shrimp/chicken pad Thai at restaurants and cheaper at chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"I've never cared for Thai food until I tried Wiang Kuk! I've tried multiple hot spots in Toronto but those are usually over rated and overly priced. This place is a true hidden gem!! I found this restaurant through yelp and was surprised to find that this place was in First Markham Place's food court! The people who work here are really thai and the food here really reflects the authenticity. I tried their coconut noodle soup which had the right amount of coconut flavor (others i've tried in the past were either too creamy or lacked the coconut entirely) and their crispy rice salad (TO DIE FOR) I couldn't stop eating it! They serve their meals with a refreshing cold sweet tea that I thought was really good as well and the prices here are super affordable. My only complaint is that they served the hot noodle soup in a plastic disposable bowl and my noodles had absorbed the soup quickly so I probably would have preferred less noodles in my bowl but besides that I can't really complain as it is in a food court! I can't WAIT to go back and try everything else on their menu!!!!"}
{"text":"This place seemed pretty authentic. The vendor was polite and you can tell she takes pride in what she does, not like some other vendors that looks like half-asleep wanting to go home and throws you a fit when you give them too many demands (man...). I digress.  I had the green curry chicken for takeout and enjoyed it very much. I will probably try something else from them next time. I think that's all I have to say for now."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today! I ordered set #11, the Heavenly Beef + Sausage (Seen Savan and Sai Oau), which came with papaya salad, chili sauce, choice of rice (I chose sticky), soup, and drink. My mom ordered the King Seafood (#4), while my Dad got the Bangkok Chicken (#1).  The heavenly beef refers to beef jerky, and I thoroughly enjoyed it! Although there were only 5 measly pieces, they were very flavourful, chewy, and smoky.  The sausage was interesting - there was lots of fatty pork, and I could distinctly taste cilantro and other spices embedded in the sausage. The sausage was crispy on the outside, but very fatty and meaty on the inside.  The sticky rice was amazing! I loved that each grain was separate from the other, and that it wasn't mushy by any means.  I enjoyed the soup as well... it was some broth with cilantro, though my sister insisted it was straight up cilantro water.  The papaya salad was very tangy, but definitely not up everyone's alley. While I enjoyed its fishy flavour, my dad felt it was too strong with the fish sauce. Moreover, be careful with the spice level - I got medium (half a chili) and it was still very spicy!  Finally, I thoroughly enjoyed the tea as well. I believe it was some red date/jujube tea, for it was very sweet and strong in red date flavour.  My mom loved her order. She felt that there were many vegetables as well as seafood, and that the broth was strong in coconut flavour. Definitely didn't skimp on ingredients!   Meanwhile, my dad's Bangkok chicken greatly resembled Hainanese chicken, except it was more rough on texture. The rice appeared to be flavoured, but wasn't really. Both enjoyed their tea as well!  We then ended the meal with our first try of mango coconut sticky rice! It was a very rich and filling dessert, very fragrant with coconut milk, sugar, and sesame seeds. I have leftovers for tomorrow, and I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Finally found a really good thai place, it reminds me of when I was in Thailand. The chef's wife is so sweet. I also like the fact that she also speak fluently thai and french. Will go there on every occasion I have"}
{"text":"came here the other day~  The food is ok, the sticky rice that came with my combo was kinda gross cause it was hard and NOT SO EASY  TO EAT.   The Jerky was also too hard to bite on felt like i am going to break my teeth if i eat anymore of it!  The sausage on the other hand tasted very good and flavorful!  But ~ not so sure if i will be back"}
{"text":"My go to thai place at the food court inside of First Markham Place  the staff are super nice and the food is fantastic!   My favourite is the coconut noodle soup with pork and vegetables and I get it spicy. Its flavourful, and has a strong coconut taste with a minor kick from the spice. It looks like a small bowl but I am stuffed by the end of it.  Their spring rolls are also amazing along with the papaya and mango salads."}
{"text":"I've never been tempted to try Thai food because I don't know what to get. Being a conservative Brit, we are not very adventurous. Well I finally decided to try some Thai food while my kids were having Korean pork bone soup. The first time I ordered a mango salad and 2 Thai pork sausages. The salad was lovely and refreshing. The sausages were nice but the taste of lemongrass and ginger was too overpowering for me. The second time, I ordered the cold chicken glass noodle salad. It didn't look like the picture because they gave me vermicelli instead of the glass noodle.(see pic). The taste was exactly the same as the mango salad.  I think that my foray into Thai food has come to an abrupt stop. At a push, I would order the mango salad again but I think I'll just stick to other foods that are available at this food court."}
{"text":"For a food court establishment, this place ain't bad at all. As well, Thai food isn't just the Pad Thai. HAHA! Anyhow. So my friends and I came here to get food and we were mesmerized with all the different choices. I wanted to stay away from the other choices available and I chose Wiang Kuk. There's no venue assessment as it is in a food court.   Food wise, like I said I stayed away from the Pad Thai and ordered the stir fried glass noodles with pork. Normally Thai food doesn't serve pork, only beef and chicken (at least to the places I gotten food from). So I gave this a go. Not bad at all, the glass noodle isn't oily and lots of onions went with it. I love the peanut that adds at texture of crunch. Flavour isn't too overpowering and the pork was stir fried just right.   I will come back to try other stuff (not Pad Thai for sure)."}
{"text":"This may be the best Thai place in GTA.   My favourite is Green Curry Chicken.   Although it is in a food court, I felt like eating something from an expensive restaurant.    I highly recommend this place to all Thai food lovers."}
{"text":"Great Thai food for a Food Court!  The mango salad is a thing of beauty. Filled with fresh Ataulfo Mangos thinly sliced, not too ripe, slightly tangy and perfectly tossed in the right dressings.  There's nothing else in the salad, it's ALL mango.  Their Pad Thai is pretty good authentic without the reddish food colouring that you normally find at other locations.    Totally would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to announce that the GTA Thai food court / take out scene is well, sad with the exception of Wiang Kuk, who has been the sole provider of my single-diner Thai meals for the last few seasons.  I haven't had the need to visit the franchise Thai Express thanks to Wiang Kuk.  Conveniently, located at First Markham Place food court Variety, of Thai dishes that'll give each visit a different flavour Spicy, if you need a good balance of flavours along with spice Cheapy, pricing makes my wallet happy and no tipping worries  I have to admit, there are a couple dishes I've tried that didn't make sense to me or my teeth but due to convenience and affordable pricing, I've had the chance to try multiple other meals and have been satisfied.  I give them more appreciation simply due to when they open shop, it was more than difficult to find a place serving Sai Oua or Larb including Downtown where Khao San Road only served Sai Oua periodically if you're lucky and many \"Thai\" restaurants where the typical ketchupy Pad Thai mumble jumble.  -=3.5 stars=-"}
{"text":"For you sticky rice fans, this one is for you. We had the sticky rice with pork chops and sticky rice with Lao sausage and beef. Both came with papaya salad. The meal was execellent, don't tell my mother who is a very proud Laotian women and cook that their Lao sausage was better. Very surprised that the food was this good since it is in the food court. Both were $5.95, a complete steal....will be back to try the whole menu...mark my words Sticky Rice will be the next \"hot food\" and this place does it very well."}
{"text":"Came here today on a Sunday evening and tried their lemongrass chicken.  Lemongrass chicken combo comes with chicken, rice, and soup, salad, small tea.  Chicken is very tasty and serving is pretty big.  I also tried their Thai milk tea and it is very good!  Will go again for sure!  Over-all no complaints. I am very impressed by all the food places in this mall. All the places I have tried have served quality food so far.. one exception: Magic Fusion.   Review 23 of 100"}
{"text":"The go to spot in this food court  Enjoy a fish cake appetizer and a wonderful Chicken in Red Curry  Fresh ingredients, service with a smile and under $10  cash only people but an ATM is 10 yards away  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Thai ice tea tasted very diluted and it was not filled to the top. I wouldn't go and get the Thai ice tea again but I will go and try their food.   This place is a cash only place so bring enough cash!"}
{"text":"While this food is not the best Thai food I have eaten in North America, it certainly is up there for its price point.   I paid $6 for a loaded plate of pad thai.   One would expect food court food to be hastily prepared and often greasy. Such is not the case with Wiang Kuk. These folks do not utilize an excessive amount of oil, but instead prefer ingredients that are rather fresh for this caliber of establishment. The three of us also did not receive the food immediately after ordering; we had to wait at least 10 minutes for it. That, to me, is a good sign.   In other words, food here is honestly prepared and more similar to something you might prepare at home yourself.  Do not be discouraged by the lack of a long line as is found at other stations of the food court. This place deserves a try."}
{"text":"This place makes the best Thai Coconut Noodle soup! Love Thai food but it's so hard to find something decent. This place is friendly, affordable, fast and best of all - delicious! Noodles are never soggy, soup is so coconuty and tangy...mmmm. Got get it ya'll!"}
{"text":"First time eating here was craving sticky rice just like how my mom use to make it. Recommend by a friend who ate here. Really authentic Laos Food, from the sticky rice, beef labp and Tom som(pappya salad) and the pork sausages taste so good. Enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"My #1 go to place for Thai food in Markham, and arguably throughout the GTA. Pam and Handsome Fong make some of the best authentic Thai food north of the 401. Nothing extravagant, post-contemporary, or melocular gastronomical about the dishes pumping out of this kitchen. Just delicious,hearty, cheap eats."}
{"text":"The food is authentic and great portions for the price. We had the green curry, heavenly beef combo and Pad Thai. All came with soup and a great sweet tea. You have to wait a bit for the food because they cook to order but it is worth the wait. It's a regular stop on my food Rolodex."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the staff are friendly and the portions are generous. For cold days like today, the Tom Yum Soup noodle always hits the spot. Make sure to order \"no spice\" if you can't handle spice and \"medium\" if you would like a generous kick. The food is prepared to order and with fresh vegetables. Ensure that you sit closely to the stall as they do not use a number system but more so call the numbers out and use eye contact. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I tried this place and would definitely come back to eat again. It seems like a family restaurant and they are very flexible with the order. I got the green curry pad thai with chicken, which wasn't on the menu but they offered to customize my order. I also got the Thai Ice Tea that was really good. It's nice to have a Thai place close to Markham. I do recommend to have takeout instead because it is at a food court."}
{"text":"First Markham Place is home to my favourite food court. They have so many choices, albeit Asian, and the food has to be good to survive. There's one place that I go to almost all the time but I felt like something different today. After surveying a few vendors, I settled on Wiang Kuk Thai Food.  I ordered the Thai Green Curry with Chicken and my companion had the Pad Thai Noodles with Chicken. It was her first time having Pad Thai. We both tried each other's dishes and were very happy with our choices. She did enjoy the Pad Thai but couldn't finish it.  The portions are very generous. The curry dish was served with a large bowl of rice and soup. With a can of pop, it was still under $10. Good value!  If you're allergic to peanuts, BEWARE! Thai cooking uses peanuts and both our dishes had peanuts. They had even more peanuts available at the pickup counter. Please be cautious of cross contamination or contact at the counter."}
{"text":"The owner and chef are Thai.  So it's real Thai food here.  I used to go there everyday for lunch when their combo price was a steal.  Now that price had gone up, I didn't go as often.  Food is good.  reasonable portion. My favourite dish is the combo with spice sausage, payaya salad, chili paste and beef jerky.  But their other dish are good.  The food taste good.  Good selection."}
{"text":"My go-to in Toronto whenever I crave Thai food. Very authentic and delicious. Don't let the location being in the food court fool you. They use fresh and good quality ingredients. They don't sweeten everything like other Thai places in the city. The seasoning is always done perfectly, and you can customize the spiciness. Strongly recommend their Tom Yum and mango salad."}
{"text":"I ordered a Coconut Milk Soup Rice Noodle ($5.50).  There was a sign on counter that said 3 chilies were Thailand spiciness.  Nope, I was not ready for Thai level, but I wanted to push my limit, so I got the soup noodle at 2 chilies.  It was spicy.  The only reason I could survive it was that the coconut milk mellowing the heat down.  The broth was creamy and flavourful.  There was lots of noodle, so I was sure anyone would get full with this.  There was not much minced meat.  I'd say the star of this order was the broth.   So much so for my adventure to improve my spiciness tolerance.  1 chili for me from now on."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and always get their red beef curry. Great flavour and heat, huge portion, and fast service. Comes in at under $10."}
{"text":"This is not one of the better Thai places I've been to. That's not to say that it's horrible by any means, but I don't know that I'd recommend it either. I ordered the coconut noodle soup (with ground pork, veggies & coriander), which also came with a Thai drink (longan and sugar cane, I believe is what the owner told me) The woman who cashed us out, as well as the cook, were incredibly friendly and the price for the food is great ($5 and change). The food was a little bit of a miss for me, however. I'd definitely say the food here is more authentic than that of Thai Express, or any other Thai fast food chains. But what I ordered was, for me, a little bland--which, for Thai food, is a word that should never be used. The soup base was creamy and tasted lightly of coconut, but it was a little too faint for my liking. Yet, without the soup, the noodles would have had no flavour whatsoever.  For someone who loves Thai food as much as I do, the fact that I didn't finish this bowl speaks volumes. And I really wanted to like it too, because the owners were so nice, but it just wasn't for me."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I can't believe I have waited this long to try this place out. Ordered the # 7 best seller on the menu which was a noodle with coconut flavour soup. Tasted really good. We also tried the mango on sticky rice dessert. No complaints here. The really only disappointment were the chicken satay. They looked like processed chicken and the dipping sauce was not near the quality of other Thai/Malaysian places. Overall very happy with this joint and will be back again."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Thai food I've had in a long time.  If you're looking for authentic Asian food, then you want to head over to First Markham Place's food court.  And if you want great Thai food, then you want to go to Wiang Kuk.  Their curry was actually spiced, as curry should be.  Too often I've had curry that - sure, it has a delicious coconut flavour, but the lack of spice leaves it tasting bland.  That's not the case with Wiang Kuk.  A little bit of sweat on the brow, with a huge bowl of curry, and a monster plate of rice to eat it with - as well as a soup and a hot tea, all for less than ten dollars?  It makes me wonder why I even left Markham in the first place."}
{"text":"Pad thai was too sweet and a little soggy. I am spoiled bc I had some really good pad thai at a place that closed down. And the price they charge in a food court $8.95. I could've got something way more delicious here at first markham place."}
{"text":"Okay gonna have to give credit when credit is due...been coming to First Markham Place and by passing all the other great food places and coming directly here.   This is the best bang for your buck authentic Thai place you will find in the GTA.    From the curries to the pad thai and to my most recent discovery, larb beef, this place has not disappointed me.  The family running Wiang Kuk takes care and provide excellent authentic Thai food at a great price.  I would much rather have Thai food here then any high end restaurant.  5/5.  Well deserved!"}
{"text":"This place was all right.  The food was cooked right in front of me and the value was amazing,  $6.00 for Green Curry on rice with a bowl of soup. Can't get any better than that. I was happy with the amount of spice in the Green Curry. Definitely would eat here again. Unfortunately, I'm rarely in the mood for curry. Still something to look out for in the future. Awesome Sauce."}
{"text":"Located in the food court of first markham place. I'd consider this place a pretty authentic place for Thai food. All their employees are from Thailand and speak Thai.   The food here is delicious. My parents love this place. They always buy take out from here every time they pass by the area.   We usually get #11 and #12 and the beef larp  These dishes taste really authentic. Full of herbs and flavour. The sticky rice here is nicely cooked. It's not too soft and not too hard.   Thai ice tea is okay. Not the best I've had. It seems a little they didn't use enough cream or milk. The flavours not creamy enough.  Overall, recommended."}
{"text":"This is located in one of my favourite food courts. Got the Thai coconut noodle soup from here today for $6.20 including tax, and it includes a cold drink (kinda like a cold Thai tea.. Sweetish).  Soup base was coconuty, I think it would benefit from being even more coconuty. The noodles comes with a good amount of ground pork. Overall, not bad, I may try it again in the future."}
{"text":"Based on my first visit, I'm giving it 3.5 stars.  I've been coming to FMP food court for many years but I have never tried this Thai place.   My family loves the BBQ place, there's two which we used to go the left side one but now the right side one (Extra BBQ).  Honestly they are both similar but I do like the home made soup from Extra BBQ.  As for the other food vendors, you can get really good Korean food which now has three.  Really strange how this food court has multiple vendors serving exactly the same food...2 BBQ places, 3 Korean places, 4 Bubble Tea/Fruit juices or is it 5.  I was really surprised at all the menu items here...thank goodness there are pictures of every dish.  I had no idea what some of these dishes were.  Thanks to Yelp reviewers, I was able to pick a few dishes to try.  Got the #13 Larb Beef and #S36 Sai Oau (Pork sausage) and the Beef Pad Thai.   I was so amazed at the Larb Beef dish which was a mixed of beef and tripe tossed with onions and coriander in a fish sauce...so refreshing and tasty!  My only complaint was that the beef was a little chewy and I got it medium rare.  Maybe I'll ask for well done next time.  I just have to say that I love this dish!  The sausage was good too but I didn't like the Pad Thai.  I'm a bit picky with Pad Thai and I found it a bit sweet.  Overall, I'm glad that I finally tried this place and now I have one more choice at FMP."}
{"text":"FOOD: I had an order of the green curry chicken on rice with vegetables. The order came with a bowl of soup and a cup of sugar cane drink. The meal was very satisfying. The curry mixed with the rice was lighter than usual curry but the flavour was still there and kicked! The chicken was tender and not dry but not juicy as well. It had a light firm texture to it but flavourful. Hands down one of the best curries I've tried for the type of food. PRICE: It was just over $6. Every meal is under $10. SERVICE: Great service! The lady in the front that was helping me was very kind, sociable and welcoming. She made good conversation while the chef was preparing my meal. AMBIANCE: The restaurant is located in a food court. It's a noisy food court but usually filled with the elderly. Good and friendly environment.  Overall I was very satisfied with the food! The price was great and you really get the bang for the buck. Friendly people! I'm definitely coming back to give the other dishes a try like their pad Thai and coconut noodle soup!"}
{"text":"Since my review back in March 2012, almost 3 years later and numerous visit to Wiang Kuk Thai Food, this is time for an update.  I like how Wiang Kuk had improved their menu selection over the years. You would find the usual Pad Thai, Mango Salad or Spring Roll that is safe and common in any other Thai restaurants in the area. But if you want to be a little more adventurous, there is also more unique item from Lao you can choose from, which I guarantee that you won't find in another restaurant in the area or even in the GTA.  I like how the price still being really reasonable with nothing over $10, just like how Thai food should be priced.  The spices and herbs are really authentic. Tons of complex flavour even without that additional Thai spiciness.  The food photos all over the food stall that helps in ordering made everything looks delicious and even harder for me to make a decision of what to order!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time thanks to a recommendation from a friend! (Had pretty high expectations)  Came with 2 others and ordered the beef pad thai, the pad kee mao, the beef larb, thai iced tea and mango sticky rice.  Food was delicious and made to order. Our favourite was the pad kee mao. But everything was delicious and flavourful!  only thing was that the mango on the mango sticky rice was quite sour (not sure if thats meant to be) but I expected it to be sweet!  needless to say, i look forward to coming here again and trying the other dishes!!"}
{"text":"For the price this place is superb. You can control the level of spice and many options. The free drink is always a plus. My favourite would have to be the tuk tuk soup noodles with chicken. This has been a go to of mine whenever I get take out at fmp food court."}
