{"text":"While they only have 10 items on the menu, the ones I tried are one of the tastiest noodles I've ever had.  Staff is attentive as well and decor is simple but sweet."}
{"text":"My hubby and I really enjoyed this place. The only advice I would give the owner is to expand their menu and add more authentic food from Wuhan city. I was born in Wuhan city and I really miss tons of food from there. I loved this restaurant overall."}
{"text":"Best place for Hot Dry Noodles in Downtown Toronto!!

Came by with two other friends, had two Hot Dry Noodles, one Hutang Fresh Fish Noodle, Dou pi ( Wuhan pizza) and Su jiao ( A dessert that's made of sticky rice, or Ci Ba in Chinese). It's definitely a good place if you want to try a true speciality of Noodle with the best ever price in downtown Toronto.

And please add the FREE sour peas to your noodle! That's extremely tasty!

Dou'pi, while priced higher than the noodle, is also worth trying, as they put lots of stuff in it ( Dry tofu, Bamboo, and Dongpo Meat) The only drawback is that they put in a flat plate, and the outer Dou'pi was not covering the whole thing)

As a Wuhaner from where the Hot Dry Noodles originated, can't say more about it's special noodles, and I won't be surprised if people just ordered the food that may not be the best here, or just not their taste."}
{"text":"The food is inexpensive and came very quickly. Hot dry noodles were very good and full of sesame flavour. I like how it was not too salty. I really liked the spicy peanuts they offered for free and got several refills! Golden stick sushi was just okay, I'll probably skip it next time."}
{"text":"Warm, inviting space; looks fantastic when compared to the restaurant that had been here before. Lots of space between tables; not touching elbows with other patrons. 

Free roasted peanuts with Chili and Szechuan \"numbing\" peppers was my only enjoyable \"numbing\" pepper experience so far. Very tasty. 

Menu prices are really low, like the vegetarian dishes are under $8. The point is to try more than one dishe. It's a \"noodle bar\", not a \"choose your entr√©e\" restaurant. Every item is recommended."}
{"text":"Large delicious bowl of noodles in soup :)

My friend and I got the \"Drowning Bull\", regular spicy, with different options for the noodles and beef (I got the wide noodles and sliced beef, and would totally do so again - it's just personal preference). 

Well flavoured, good mix of ingredients, and fair price for the meal. All in all a good value option. 

Will be back to try out the other items on the menu... if I don't default to getting the same thing again! Except maybe kick it up a notch and make it spicier."}
{"text":"We came here for a Saturday lunch and it was almost all full. We were seated fairly quickly and were given some spicy peanuts when seated, but no water. There was only one waitress during this busy time. 

We had just started looking at the menu but then the waitress came and asked us what we wanted to order. We didn't even look through the whole menu yet, but since the menu was only one sided we just scanned through it quickly. We ordered one sesame lover with regular noodles and then we asked the waitress what would she recommend. She said sesame lover. We ordered one already so obviously we wanted something else. But since we were starving, so we ordered another sesame lover with rice noodles. We didn't want to add any toppings but the waitress was like \"No toppings!?!\" so one we added chicken and one we added beef brisket. 

It took a while for the food to come (~30 mins). We were confused why it would take so long just to make 2 bowls of noodles. The bowl with regular noodles and beef brisket had much more noodles and was much hotter than the one with rice noodles and chicken. The regular noodles were okay, but the rice noodles were extremely soft and overcooked. The beef brisket was all tendons, no meat. The chicken was also very dry and tough. The sauce is okay, very strong sesame taste. 

The worst part - THERES LOTS OF MSG IN THE NOODLES. After eating here, we had ice cream and drank lots of water, BUT WE WERE STILL THIRSTY FOR HOURS."}
{"text":"Panpan is located on the second floor and the group of us were attracted to this restaurant because of the decor (how can you say no to pandas plastered on the wall and stuffed animals?). The service is great and they serve every table complimentary peanuts to start. 
We each ordered the Sesame Lover which is their most well known dish - you can choose from noodle/rice noodle or vermicelli and range for spiciness. You have to mix in the sauce which is situated at the bottom of the bowl or it will become quite spicy near the end. Personally I found the dish to be mediocre, they were quite heavy on the peanut sauce and it became too overwhelming. 
We also got the Wuhan style Siu Mai. If you've been to dimsum before, I would liken this to a miniature Chiu Chow Fun Guo. Again the four of us didn't love the dish. I would say the best thing we tried was the Sticky Rice Crepe. Definitely a great appetizer to share among friends."}
{"text":"Cheap price but small portions. Nothing special about the noodles l. I had the drowning bull and I could make it at home."}
{"text":"Panpan Noodle Bar is located in my favourite food street of Baldwin Village. 

The food is good, but I think the portion size is just WAY too small for the price we pay. In fact, I've never seen such small portions before. If the price of the food I order is more than a Chipotle bowl and I'm still hungry after eating, then I usually don't have a good impression of the restaurant.  

(Yes, Chiptole is the standard and is the best. It's not too expensive, if you choose the right ingredients, it's good for the macros, and most importantly, I get FULL from Chiptole bowls.) 

I ordered the Meat Sauce Volcano and I thought the meat was cooked perfectly and the noods were really tasty and were definitely made in the restaurant because you can see how uneven they were. Though, I did think it was kind of weird and cute how the chefs made the plate literally look like a volcano. 

I got takeout for my BF. He got the Seasme Lover (Hot Dry Noodles) which he said had A LOT of flavor. I do not eat beef, but all it smelled like was hot chili oil and sesame oil and I had to quickly turn away before I broke my sustainability oath. I will note here that the take-out container was EVEN SMALLER THAN MY PORTION!! He woofed it down in TWO BITES I KID YOU NOT. 

I probably will not come back here anytime soon because the portion sizes are ridiculously small. 

TLDR; XS portions but tasty and delicious noods at my favorite Baldwin Village. DO NOT GET TAKE OUT unless you're feeding an elf with an XXS appetite. It is a potential that my BF and I have XXL stomachs."}
{"text":"We had both of the sesame noodles, each used a different type of noodles. They were both pretty tasty and authentic. This place definitely catered to the more \"Asian Palletes\" tho."}
{"text":"Came here for WuHan hot dry noodles ($7.99). It was really good and did not disappoint, I really liked the sesame paste however the portions could have been bigger for the price. We also ordered the Wuhan DouPi ($12.99)  which was a rice + egg + pork pancake, there was hardly any pork and tasted a bit bland.
Overall great place for a snack and I would only come back for the hot dry noodles."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch as our attempt last time for dinner was unsuccessful due to literally all items selling out, save for one!  Lunch had a few menu items sold out too.  We went with the Drowning Bull and it was delicious; savoury noodle soup with beef brisket and generous garnishes.  Restaurant set-up is cutest and simple, up on the second floor.  Would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Definitely try their beef noodle soup. It's pretty good. I wasn't too of a fan for the dry noodles though."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Baldwin village, on the second floor. Tasty memorable noodles dishes! Really like the sticky rice crepe too! Great staff and service as well! Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan! 

Panpan is the new restaurant that opened up in Baldwin Village. My boyfriend and I tried this place out recently. I got the sesame noodle dish and it was really yummy! The portion is a bit small, and I was definitely still hungry after. We decided to get the rice pancake as an appetizer to share. It was not worth it. It was basically just fried rice...?

Anyway, that being said, I still really enjoyed Panpan. It's got some really cute vibes with cute little pandas painted onto the wall (I want my room to be like that). Stick to one the main dishes and instead of splitting an appetizer, use the extra money to grab desert from one of the nearby restaurants."}
{"text":"Unique noodle joint with potential.

The menu itself is quite limited, with ~10 items. While we were there, we were also notified that 3 of the items were not available, leaving us with 7 items to choose from. They are still quite new so I totally get it, but I definitely hope Panpan would be expanding their menu in the future, or at the very least, ensure that all of their items are available!

I ordered the Drowning Bull (beef brisket noodle soup) and my boyfriend got the Spicy Sesame Lover with extra meat sauce. For the noodle soup, while I found the broth to be a little bit salty on its own, I really enjoyed slurping it up with the cilantro and green onions. The noodles were springy and well-done, and there were a decent amount of bok choy and beef brisket. My boyfriend and I both liked the Sesame Lover, but the additional meat sauce made the dish way too salty. We tried ordering for another portion of noodles but were informed that they do not offer that option. Towards the end, we had to dump the meat sauce into my noodle soup to dilute it and finish our food.

All in all, the flavours are there, but there are certain easy tweaks that would make the dishes a lot more tasty. I'm excited to come back in a few months to try it again!"}
{"text":"Hot dry noodle is fine but the fish soup is tasteless."}
{"text":"It's supposed to be authentic (says my Chinese friends) and it tastes very unique. I tried the sesame lover and a few other dishes but that is my favourite dish! It has a savoury taste and has a bit of peanut flavour. I never had a dish like this before, and I grew to love it! 

Server was also very nice and prompt. It was quite busy during lunch time, so try to be there a bit before noon to secure seats. 

Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Please Please Please Panpan make sure that you give customers proper takeout containers. I've had my beef noodle soup spill in the TTC inside the plastic bag because the contained softened under the heat of the soup and broke. 

Taste wise, the broth was very yummy. A good amount of noodles, a hard boiled marinated egg, some beef and some boiled bokchoy. Nothing too standout but nothing bad. They are currently having a 2-% discount for their soft opening!"}
{"text":"Located on the 2nd floor, Panpan is a cute space with the vibrant panda mural. Service was amateurish but attentive and food is decent. I enjoyed the Hot Dry Crab and the sweet soy milk but feel like I could've gotten better bang for my buck elsewhere. If you're a noodle-lover though, prolly worth a try. No wait on a Monday evening!"}
{"text":"Saw the sign on Baldwin street that this noodle place just opened and as part of their grand opening, there is a discount of 20% on everything on their menu. Cash only!

This new resto is located right above Light Cafe and serves mainly noodles. I heard this place wasn't due to open this soon so it was a surprise to see an opening sign on the street.

The restaurant has mostly of 2 to 4 seats table. There is a big red wall on one side with cute drawing of pandas making and eating noodles.

Ordered the beef noodle brisket \"Drowning Bull\" for $10.99 and the Meat Noodle volcano for $8.99. The beef noodle brisket soup base is delicious but a tad salty. There were only three brisket pieces and I think most of them were tendon so therefore, the Meat was kind of chewy. I guess this is the standard for many places to have so little piece of meat. 

The meat noodle volcano was well presented with lovely colour combination of thinly sliced carrot. I really like the Meat with the noodle despite how little it was.

Both dishes were medium sized so I would consider these two dishes to be just as snacks as opposed to a full meal.

With so much competiton around the neighborhood, I really hope this restaurant survives."}
{"text":"Situated on the second floor is a noodle bar with origins based in Hunan.

As the staff told us, all noodles are made from their recipe which makes their noodles stand alone from all others in the city. Top that my friends.

I tried an incredible variety from their menu. Everything was delicious. I prefer things with a light spice but they are more than happy to change the spice level.

Highlights from their menu include the vermicelli noodles with beef brisket, the sticky rice crepe that I've never had before. This was intriguing and delicious. I also had sui mai which had this fresh, homemade taste.

Dessert was fascinating. I don't even know how to describe it other than if you go - try both. One was a purple fried yam thing - this circular disc was crisp and sweet - like a thick fried sweet potato .

Amazing yet visually maybe the most unappealing but hands down my favourite thing. Warm, gooey, chewy sweetness that you dip in this powder which I think was told it was a green bean dust thing (I might have that part wrong but whatever that is --- wow!!) I would absolutely order this again.

Fabulous customer service.
Check the site for hours as they are not open very late."}
{"text":"The Hot Dry Noodles did not disappoint!  Excellent with or without an extra kick of chilli oil.  Nice atmosphere, friendly staff."}
{"text":"This noodle bar is amazing. Although it's hidden on top of the well-known Light Cafe, I'd say the taste of the food at this place surpasses the cafe by far! (Sorry, Light Cafe.) The place is nothing fancy in terms of furniture deco, but they do have a huge, cute panda mural on one wall. I had their famous sesame noodles with pickled cowpeas. The flavour in this dish is so good. I can't even explain the taste but it's rich and definitely filling. The bowl seems small, but the noodles filled me up, personally. Something to note, my friend ordered the shredded chicken and it comes cold. I think the point is to mix it up with the hot noodles...? In addition, the restaurant was hosting some sort of social media event that night, so the servers were very attentive to that one group. They could've been slightly better with all the other groups that were present. But I'd still come back because those noodles are so damn good."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for lunch right when they the store just opened. I could tell they were getting busy with group of crowds coming in.  This is a great fast food place for those that work around the area. 

I ordered the:
PanPan's signature sesame lover 
Base: rice noodle
Toppings: pickled cowgrass, shredded chicken breast 
Level of spice: reg spicy 
Comes with garlic, green onion & cilantro

I like how you can choose the kind of noodle you want.  The food was fairly good. I thought that the reg spicy was just right, even tho I drank a few glasses of water, I enjoyed the spice level.  The toppings and chicken was also delicious and went well with the noodle.  You have to mix the toppings/noodles/sesame sauce really well or all the sauce will be at the bottom and your food will taste dry.

Overall, I had a good experience dining in at Panpan Noodle Bar.  Staff was very attentive and friendly.  I would come back if I'm around the area and try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Really enjoyable atmosphere. The food quality is great and the prices seem fair. I had the beef bowl and although they could add a bit more into it I don't regret ordering it. Service was nice as well. 

Maybe my only other critique is that I wish there was some kind of hot drink options :P"}
{"text":"Two other tables but service was quite slow. When we asked for more water, they gave us a pitcher which was good for 1 full refill of each of our small cups.

I ordered the dry crab noodle because it seemed most popular. It was hugely disappointing. Very plain tasting, too oily, and not balanced. It needed some crunchy fried veggies or more fresh scallions. I didn't even get a good/strong taste of the crab. The noodles did not impress me either. They were pretty hard and didn't taste fresh. I thought a noodle bar would make the noodles in house but it tasted like cheap, dry grocery store noodles.
My other 3 friends got the seasame noodles with beef. They all commented that it was too plain, too much oil, too much noodles, and not enough meat. The portion was alright in size. No one finished because they just didn't like the food.
I saw on instagram that if you had infinity mirror tickets, they'd give us 10% off. I showed the sever our 4 tickets and she printed our receipts. There was no discount applied... Not very attentive at all. Can't imagine this place surviving for long when there are so many better options around."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like it.. but I just couldn't. My friend who's normally not picky about food at all, she couldn't even finish it. 

Since they are known for the dry noodles, I tried their hot dry crab noodle for $13.99. There wasn't much crab meat and I couldn't taste the different layers of flavors since the noodle was way too spicy (and I love spicy food, trust me!). The noodles felt like instant noodle... 

My friend got their pepper blast (name check?) and same issue with the noodles. The broth had a sticky texture and no flavors at all. She basically left 90% of the food untouched lol."}
{"text":"First time having the Wuhan dry noodles in Toronto. The flavors are mostly similar to what I remember compared to China. One thing that the sesame dry noodles came without the hot oil, I would've thought it is included in every standard bowl. Wouldve been better if it did come with the hot oil. Overall still pretty dceent"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the hot dry noodles, giving it 5/5 as my friend from Wuhan (where the noodle is originated) approved the authenticity! The sesame sauce was quite aromatic. The chunks of sour green beans had crunchy texture and mixed so well with the noodles. Definitely recommend it! 
We also ordered the beef noodles and the minced pork pancake (dou pi) -- i'd give them 4/5, and 3/5, respectively. For beef noodles, I'd recommend Charidise next door. The pancake was not as flavourful as I imagined (also not authentic, according to my friend from Wuhan). 

I will come back for the hot dry noodles by itself though.

The service was excellent too -- they remembered exactly everyone's preferences and were quite attentive.

I also hope they can expand the menu in the future -- more appetizers for example."}
{"text":"Friendly. Clean. Comfortable. Nice view of Baldwin. 

The noodles, the sides, and the service are all good. I recommend PanPan to anyone in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Another great addition to Baldwin Village, PanPan Noodle Bar serves comfort food from Wuhan, China. I was not exactly sure what type of cuisine this is, so I was very curious and excited to try! It is located on the 2nd floor, right above Light Cafe. Unfortunately, there is no elevator, just a narrow flight of stairs. My friend managed to bring a stroller up ;) Anything for good food really lol.

PanPan specializes in dry noodles mixed with a variety of aromatic sauces. Most popular ones would be the Sesame Lover and the Dry Hot Crab (3 chili pepper kind of hot!) Both IMO very delicious - the crab one pretty much won everyone's heart at my table ;)

For the Sesame Lover, you can choose from traditional Wuhan styled housemade noodles, rice noodles or wide vermicelli. The housemade noodles are very light, and cooked al dente. If you prefer your noodles a tad softer, go for the rice noodles or wide vermicelli.

I would also recommend the following:

- Wuhan style siu mai (4 pcs) - dumpling made with sticky rice, diced mushrooms, and meat  (I forgot if it was pork or chicken, sorry). 
- Sticky rice pancake - covered with a layer of egg on top, the sticky rice on the bottom along with delicious ingredients
- Soft Inside (2 pcs) - a fried mochi like dessert, comes with a housemade sweet dipping powder on the side

Overall, a very satisfying meal. Thank you so much for the delicious food and excellent service :) I would certainly come back again!

P.S. make sure you save room for dessert! The rice wine soup dessert was very light and enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Authentic Wuhan style noodle. If you like spicy, ask for extra spicy.

I like sticky rice cake, so ordered 'soft inside'. It is tasty with sweet bean powder on the side.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ordered the meat sauce noodle ???, probably the most tasteless ??? in history. I am Chinese so I have pretty high expectation for Taiwanese food. Nothing special, they use the same type of noodles and just add different toppings on top. Need to pay extra for meat as well, even though is supposed to be the main ingredient to the noodles. Should probably expand the menu to compete with other noodle bars at Toronto. I am not impressed, probably just a try once, never going back again kind of restaurant."}
{"text":"Affordable eats but nothing special. The classic sesame noodles was tasty but didn't blow my mind. It is good for a quick and affordable lunch though. The hot dry crab noodles were OK but not great. 

The siu mai was decent as an app to share. I also ordered the soft inside dessert out of curiosity and it was underwhelming. It was basically a chunk of mochi like ball (what you find in some dimsum desserts) accompanied by some sweet powder.

The decor here is cute but not a new go to spot for me."}
{"text":"Ordered from Uber eats... 

I was shocked at the portion size (literally the same dimensions as a roll of toilet paper). If you are going to be charging $13 dollars for a bowl, this is not the way to do it. This is borderline scamming people...

I ordered the sesame lover with meat sauce and hot crab. The food was pretty disappointing to say the least... It is packed with garlic and lots of MSG (incredibly thirsty after). To add salt on the wound... it was 95% noodles. Definitely earning high margins here for what they are dishing out. 

Overall, this was a poor experience and will recommend anyone to stray away from this place."}
{"text":"The Panpan Noodle Bar is a great place to get casual fast food. I recommend getting the sesame noodles. The noodles were nice and firm and the sauce was delicious. It was a very good meal. They also came with spicy peanuts, which is a standard (but great) Chinese snack.

The noodles weren't enough to fill me, so I got the shao mei & a free yam donut (for following then on instagram). The appetizers were pretty underwhelming though: both were very greasy, and didn't have much flavour.

The restaurant itself gives off a very clean and vibrant feel - the furnishings are minimalistic, while the walls are bright red with cute panda paintings on them. 

The main cons here were that the serving size was relatively small, and that the meat topping I got (shredded chicken) came with very little meat. The overall cost of the food wasn't that high though, and the noodles were delicious, so I still recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"3.5 The noodle consistency is really good, but the Pepper Blaster is on the salty side. It was definitely worth trying out during their soft opening as everything was 20% off. Worth the try, but won't be my go-to noodle shop."}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick meal. The menu isn't overly complicated or long. They focus on just a few key dishes with a few sides you can order. You also start off with some complimentary spicy peanuts.

I ordered the Sesame Lover with regular noodles and shredded chicken. Mine was regular spice (1 chili symbol) and I found that to be perfect for someone who can't eat too spicy (me). As expected, there's a strong sesame taste to the sauce, but be sure to mix the bowl well as the liquid is at the bottom. It's garnished with green onions, garlic, and cilantro. Unfortunately, I didn't mix my  bowl well enough until near the end, but after I did, I fell in love (before then it was a 4/5 for me). The side of cucumbers I ordered was served in a sweet and lightly vinegar-like sauce. It provided some much needed crunch and complimented my sesame noodles well.

The server we had was very nice to us and prompt. He seated us with no qualms even though we came in close to closing time (we were out before they closed!). As first timers he explained the menu and answered all our questions. At this time they only accept debit and cash. 

Hopefully they open a location in Scarborough soon! Until then, it'll be one of my top choices on Baldwin Street."}
{"text":"My kind of noodles - cheap, fresh, flavorful and greasy. Their sesame noodles and spicy noodles were sooo good. If I weren't constantly on a low-carb diet I would come here everyday. Can't wait to try the hot dry crab noodles next."}
{"text":"The food wasn't what I expected it to be. I grabbed the peppery fish broth with noodles and although it tasted good, there was nothing else in there. Just the chinese fried dough, noodles and broth. The price was okay but I wish there was more substance to the dish. The service was quick and friendly but again, didn't enjoy the food so much."}
{"text":"Great selection of popular items from Wuhan, China. As someone who grew up in Wuhan I gotta say the taste is very authentic, and the chief definitely has put in effort and used premium ingredients in order to maintain the food quality. Highly recommended to those who are open to the variety of Chinese food."}
{"text":"Pictured is the 'Hot Dry Crab', 'WuHan Style Sui Mai' and 'Sesame Lover' with shredded chicken breast. And for those who like some spice, this resto is perfect for those who can take the heat

Food is mediocre and wouldn't say that this is something that I would find myself craving for, but definitely worth trying if you want to experience traditional WuHan style street food! 

P.S Be sure to try their signature 'Soft Inside' dessert!"}
{"text":"I got the Drowning Bull (beef brisket soup noodle) and it's definitely one of the better beef noodle soups that I've had in Toronto.

Broth - good flavor, not as salty as most beef noodle soups tend to be. Ask for it to come spicy! Their hot oil had great flavor.
Noodles - it was nice and chewy, and cooked perfectly.
Toppings - the beef was really tender and there were quite a few pieces of tendon. They were also generous with the cilantro.

My husband got the Sesame Lover (hot dry noodles), which he loved but I wasn't a fan of as I found it a bit greasy. We found the portion size for to be on the slightly smaller side but it was probably a good thing as it was quite a heavy dish. 

Would definitely come back for the Drowning Bull!"}
