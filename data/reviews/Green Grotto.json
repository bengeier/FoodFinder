{"text":"My favorite place for bubble tea. They have a good selection of drinks, and the decor is quite nice. If you are unsure what to get, their top 10 options are a good place to start. I recommend the summer breeze which is a nice refreshing drink. They also give free popcorn which is a nice bonus. They are quite busy on Friday and Saturday nights, so expect a wait if you go during those times."}
{"text":"Their drink is expensive but very delicious.  I  like their location and atmosphere.  Good for friend gathering and study"}
{"text":"3.5/5 for drinks and atmosphere. Pretty nice place for hangouts. 

Unfortunately their food is probably good for snacking only. Salt and pepper chicken and fries are nice but that's it. 

Wish they could have more options for food."}
{"text":"I would rate it 2.5 stars if I could.

Drinks are like other quality bubble tea places; great flavour with decent tapioca bubbles.  The bubbles in my drink were fresh and \"chewy\".

Food: not fresh and obviously microwave-reheated food (I heard the microwave beeps, as we were the only diners in the restaurant at the time). 

Bottom line: would come here for the drinks but definitely not for food."}
{"text":"Nice and chill atmosphere. Free popcorn is provided when you step in so you can have something to munch on while waiting.

The desserts were very very mediocre. Cream brûlée was so burnt it is bitter. The grass jelly bowl was too sweet, and the mango mousse cake just taste like mango sauce on normal cake."}
{"text":"Interior of the store is beautifully renovated. Drinks here are good and place can get quite packed. Waiters will give free popcorn and if that isn't enough to have with your drink, you can always order hot foods or slices of cake off the dessert menu. It's kind of like a nicely designed asian Timmies... but with bubble tea instead of coffee."}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

We were here on 2 occasions, one in the evening to get takeout which took about 30 minutes since the place was packed and once recently at around lunch time on a weekday.

I would recommend going there during the mid day hours on weekdays if possible, as there are not a lot of people and you can often choose your seats. There are many plugs are you plug in your tech, so it is a great place to get work done. One thing to also consider to bring are noise cancelling headphones, as with many cafes if does get noisy at times. They also offer free wifi, the ps is green9 or can be found on small wood plack near the wall.

They also offer lunch set combos (11a - 3p) which includes a small drink for around $10. The meal includes a salad and 2 other small side dishes as well. It's a great combo especially considering drinks alone are around $6 each. 

I wouldn't recommend coming here in the evening as it is always packed and there are not a lot of parking spaces available either. They do offer drive thru service, but again there is always a line up."}
{"text":"Decor was great, but food was very disappointing. Everything tasted microwaved, and it wasn't exactly cheap either. Taiwanese food can be done so much better."}
{"text":"Always the go to place when it comes to grabbing a drink and relaxing. 

The only issue is that their wifi is inconsistent and keeps disconnecting."}
{"text":"This place is a lot better than what it used to be. I used to come here regularly on the evenings and then didn't go for a couple months. They hired more English-speaker servers so they don't mess up my order anymore! The food is decent, the bubble tea here is great. If you plan on staying 3+ hours though, they do tell you need to order more to stay in your seat... but it's common among some Chinese/Taiwanese establishments."}
{"text":"This Green Grotto is the only one I've been too. It is great, the food and bubble tea is fantastic. They serve bubble tea in glass cups and regular plastic cups if you take it to go. Their menu has a lot of items to choose from. Their salt and pepper chicken is a must. Although their food and snacks are tasty, it takes forever to get to your table. One time, I went with a group of friends and we were the only ones in the store. It still took like 25 minutes... This is a great place to hang out with friends. The decor gives a home like vibe and they have free popcorn. Although sometimes it doesn't taste very good, it's still complimentary (: I have stumbled upon 2 workers who didn't seem very experienced, if was quite a long time ago though. One got our orders wrong and another spilled drinks on our table. This is place is really busy at certain times and it is hard to find seats. People sit here for hours with their laptops. Also something to mention is that this place can get pricy and you also gotta consider tips."}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars for its nice ambience, very typical Taiwanese cafe...for younger middle class. Great place to chat with friends for one or two hours or maybe work on something on laptops, and I've seen lots of ppl doing that already.
The drink and desserts are not bad, 3 stars? Dont remember the name of the drink... I ordered a hot drink with red bean and milk, turned out too sweet. The cheesecakes were fine. I would say a bit over priced."}
{"text":"Very good place. Authentic Taiwanese. Delicious food and tea. Can keep on getting the pop corn!  But the WiFi here sucks. It keeps on disconnecting while I was doing this review..."}
{"text":"Food & drinks 2/5
- their drinks are not consistent. Ordered hokkaido milk tea every visit and it does not taste the same. The food is not hot enough which probably they just microwave it. 

Service 2/5
- very slow service. The servers are not attentive and rude. He just threw the bill on the table and did not say thank you after we paid.

Atmosphere 4/5
- dining room is pretty spacious and they got free
 wifi."}
{"text":"Been here since Day 1 and although I liked their original store much better, which was smaller, cozy and distinctive in character compared to the lounge/restaurant style now, their quality and service are still great. It is the top choice when I look for a spot to chill with free popcorn and my favorite winter melon black tea, or meet up with couple of people to have dinner, or even an afternoon of work session with the right amount of background buzz.

Their servers don't turnover as much with the current crew, so they know their stuff very well and could resolve issues with great flexibility. 

The bar table in the middle is great, and the tree sticking in the middle of it is even better, I just wish they had electric plugs under the table.

Parking is never an issue, but seat availability is when it comes to after work hours or weekend.

I think it only gets better once summer officially hits and the patio is open."}
{"text":"This is the new Green Grotto which opened in the same plaza that the old one was in. The interior is a lot bigger, has a nice ambiance and it is a nice place to meet up with friends. It is usually very busy (noisy) and has a seating time of 3 hours. The service is pretty decent, they are very busy and the waitresses are always running around but once you catch their attention they serve you properly. 

As always, they serve you complimentary popcorn after you place your orders (unlimited popcorn!). The drinks are good, I like their new foam tea series (green tea, black tea and oolong tea) otherwise their classic Hokkaido milk tea is always a favourite. The hot tea pots are also pretty good and they refill the hot water for you as well but it is a bit more pricier than the normal bubble tea. 

I just don't like their food, the only decent one I would recommend is the beef noodle soup. Otherwise, stay away from the food menu. The fish cakes, popcorn chicken and dinner dishes are all really salty. The dinner dishes come with small side dishes that tastes like it was from a can/jar that they bought from TnT which aren't that great tasting. 

The dessert and cakes are a little better than the food, but I find it a little over priced for a slice of cake. Overall, I would recommend trying the drinks there and eat dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"Today's the second time I've been to this location and I have to say, I was pretty disappointed and as was the friend I was with. I ordered an iced passionfruit green tea and my friend had a taro slush. Both drinks were more on the bitter side so we asked for some sweet syrup to add to our drinks and the server was accommodating about that. However, a little while later I ordered sweet potato fries and when they arrived there was sugar all over the fries. I'm a pretty reasonable person, but after having a bite or two of the fries I realized that there was no way I could eat them. I asked the server if he could take it back and explained that it was nothing like what I expected and apologized for the inconvenience. When we were leaving and I was about to pay, I noticed that I was charged for the sweet potato fries. In surprise I asked the server if he charged me for them and he confirmed that he had. Now, if I had eaten half of the plate I could understand being charged for the fries, but I had eaten no more than 2 of them and was still charged. The fries were about $6/$7 and I didn't want to make a scene over fries so I left, but I figured that I should write a review and save someone the trouble of being in a similar situation. Needless to say, I don't think I'll be going back to this location any time soon :("}
{"text":"The first thing that comes to mind is comfortable atmosphere. The high ceilings and lots of natural light from the windows makes it a very relaxing place to eat and hang out with friends. Lots of varied types of seating catering to groups of various sizes. Suitable for a person to go by themself too. However, the food needs some improvement. 

Food:
Menu is not as varied as the other Green Grotto locations. This one is only a double sided page with a small selection of appetizers, ramen or 2 types of rice plates. The sauce for the rice plates were both spicy so i couldn't order that. The ramen had a vegetarian and non-spicy broth so I ordered the non spicy pork bone broth. Drink selection was also limited without hot drinks (see menu pic).

I ordered the pork bone broth with Japanese bbq pork. It came with a drink. The drink was good, made as I expected. I was disappointed with my ramen though. Some of my noodles were still clumped together and not cooked thoroughly. Even after stirring it around in the hit broth, it was still clumped together. Portion was okay, with only about 5 small pieces of bbq pork. My egg was also peeled such that it wasn't whole (see pi). Overall, the presentation was lacking. But, the pork bone broth was good. The taste of the broth was flavourful and not salty. If they improve the other aspects, I would try again. My friend who ordered the same dish had a nicer dish and noodles were cooked better, so perhaps they are still refining their processes since i visited during their soft opening. 

My other friend ordered the curry pork chop dish. She thought the flavour was good but the main issue that bothered her was that the dish was not hot enough. Again, this is something that can be resolved with better processes.

Service:
We went during the peak lunch time and it was very full so service was lacking. It was hard getting someone free to take our order. Also, other tables got popcorn to much on while they were waiting and we didn't. We also didn't get any water or cutlery until we asked for it when we got our dish. 

Overall, this place has great potential and I hope that with time, they will refine and improve on some of these aspects that I suggested. Once improved, I'll be glad to come again to try."}
{"text":"They had great bubble tea and desserts. Loved the wide selection of drinks on the menu. My whole family loved it. I also loved how you got free popcorn while waiting for your food to come 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday afternoon from 2pm and stayed until about 8pm. This place is great for getting work done as it is spacious and comfortable. There are also a lot of plugs and the wifi is pretty fast! I also loved the atmosphere and decor of the place. 

The service is great as we got our food pretty quickly and they constantly refilled the free popcorn for us. 

The food portions are towards the small side but the size of the large drinks was perfect. I ordered the salt and pepper chicken rice lunch special which was delicious. There was a lot of rice and not as much chicken as I had hoped for but the chicken was perfectly seasoned and fried. 

The bill came to about $13 which is extremely reasonable for lunch and place to study. 

Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Decent service, great bubble tea and free popcorn! What else could I ask for? I love studying here, despite the noise levels during peak hours. Sometimes you need to get out of your house to work in a different environment and I usually come to Green Grotto. Definitely recommend the Lychee Green Tea and Salt and Popcorn Chicken. :)"}
{"text":"The drinks are Green Grotto are always good, albeit a bit pricy. This place is nice and spacious, good place for getting a drink and hanging out with friends. They have a wide selection of Taiwanese food - and they even list out their \"top 10\" most popular items.

Their Hokkaido style milk tea (#1 for drinks) is quite good. I would recommend it, although it is quite sweet so it might be good to ask for less ice and less sugar. I thought Popcorn Chicken was quite nice. It comes with some small sides such as bamboo shoots and kimchi, but their kimchi was overly spicy. I got the Three Cups Chicken but the sauce was too salty for me. 

Bill came out to just over $60 for 4 people with 4 drinks and 4 Taiwanese meal sets."}
{"text":"I tried the taro milk tea freeze and had the salted pepper chicken for a snack. The food is okay, but the drink is below average. The drink was suppose to be a freeze but it came out as if it had sat in the open for awhile and was starting to melt. The free popcorn doesn't really make up for the quality of the drinks."}
{"text":"I drank my bubble tea even though it wasn't the right flavour. I ate my ramen even though it wasn't what I ordered. I continued to come here even with awful service. But after seeing one of the servers reuse a a dirty popcorn bowl and toss old popcorn back into the machine I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Always see people in here so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try since we were craving some bubble tea. We got seated and went over the menu. They have milk teas, hot teas, and shakes of different flavours. They had some pretty standard flavours that you can get at any bubble tea shop. They also offered various food items to full plates of noodles to cheesecakes.

Service wasn't the best. I felt like we had to keep flagging someone down to get an order in and the bill. You get a bowl of popcorn to munch on but they were chewy and seemed stale. We decided to share a large taro coconut milk tea and the Hong Kong toast. The bubble tea wasn't as flavourful as I expected, even with the 2 flavours combined. The toast was pretty good. Never had anything like that before.

If I were craving some bubble tea, I'd probably just go elsewhere as the service wasn't that great."}
{"text":"I love coming here to study! The environment is really nice and usually it's not too crowded. I've tried their food here and I enjoyed it. Portion size is good for the price and the food is pretty good. I also enjoyed the fresh milk with winter-melon. The decor is also very nice. Their long table is the organic wood kind which I love. 100% would recommend"}
{"text":"The drinks are a bit overpriced and the service is obnoxiously slow. I don't notice anything particularly great about the bubble tea here but I'll do a rare takeout once in a while. Takeout is okay and usually a standard wait. 

Sitting in is terribly slow. With only roughly four to five customers on a weekday in the space, a single drink still took nearly fifteen+ minutes to arrive and it also takes too long to wave someone down for any request at all, including just to take your order. 

No longer a regular, even if I live really close by."}
{"text":"Cool Place on the border of Markham. 

Board Game Cafe meets Starbucks. Friendly young staff that are very inviting. Some games to choose from to play with friends, or bring your laptop and use the wifi to get some work done.  A great place to study or have desert on a date. 

Lots of Taiwanese Teas and cold beverages, big drink menu.

Good parking, good place to go if you want to get out of the house. Small Patio if the weather is right.

Enjoy the Free Popcorn, and if you don't like the games, bring your own!

Recommendation: Slush Mango Bubble Tea with Tapioca"}
{"text":"They picked a horrible location for their newest store. Being from the area, I know the plaza is pretty dead. It explains why business is always slow here. 

However, it is beautifully decorated. Along with some board games provided, there is a foosball table in the middle for entertainment. Since it's normally quiet here, it's the perfect place to come to study or catch up with some friends. 

The staff are always very friendly. Can't complain about the service at all. 

Similar to other Green Grotto's they provide complementary popcorn. The snacks and food they have are simply alright and I wouldn't really come here for that. The drinks are what they excel at. Their wintermelon lemon iced tea is my absolute favourite here. It's a perfect balance between refreshing and sweet. I've enjoyed their milk teas as well. Did try it hot once and I definitely prefer it iced. 

I normally just order drinks for takeout when I come and will continue to do so if they last in this location. I hope they do ."}
{"text":"Came here during my work lunch to meet with a friend. We both got the lunch special. I opted for the rice and salt/pepper chicken and rose bubble tea. My friend got the ramen. 

For $15 you get a large serving of rice, chicken and ground meat with a regular size bubble tea. I don't think the price is that great to be called a \"lunch special\" 

The food was good but bubble tea was very sub par. I would not repurchase. The service is fast but the severs should be able to speak English fluently to better communicate with the customers. I had lots of trouble asking and explaining things to one of the severs."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for lunch and experienced their terrible customer service. 

My friend's creamy veg ramen was too salty to eat. I tried some too and agreed. She mentioned this to our server and we were told she couldn't order something new. They would only replace this exact menu item - even though the broth would be from the same batch, but they could \"water it down\" to dilute the salt. 

My friend didn't want the same menu item, and she was told she had to pay for it anyway, even though she barely ate any of it.

I asked for a manager and was told they weren't there. We later found out the assistant manager was there but no one mentioned this when we asked to speak to someone. We asked for the manager's name and the man who brought us the machine to pay said he didn't know the manager's name. We asked the assistant manager for the name and eventually got it. When I asked when the manager would be in next, she said she didn't know.

I find it hard to believe that no one knows when their manager will be in the store, and their policy regarding inedible menu items is ridiculous."}
{"text":"we came here for a matcha latte (the menu name it matcha frothie) ...very disappointing...couldn't really taste the matcha flavor..and pretty much taste like just milk..and ordered the drink HOT..but the drink temp is semi-cold..like it was warm when i first tasted it but the next second..it taste cold..i bet it was b/c they didn't heat up the milk long enough..and the drink price is on the higher end...

I would not recommend this place for its matcha latte.."}
{"text":"This place is always packed. You'll have to wait around 20 to 40 min for a table. All the drinks are really really sweet, which is why I always have to ask for less sugar.

We also ordered the \"curry sirloin set\" for $10. I imagined it'd be a small piece of steak with curry on top, but it wasn't. It was a minuscule portion of curry with exactly 4 tiny chunks of beef skin (definitely not what I thought sirloin would be), and a single chunk of potato.

One of the beef pieces was GREEN (picture attached). OK, I know this place is called green grotto but the BEEF WAS GREEN. I asked if it's normal, and the explanation I got was that it was caused by the beef's blood. Now, I've had beef my whole life, all kinds of cuts, in curry, BBQ or seared, and I've never seen it green like this. I know beef can turn iridescent from oxidation (like roast beef) but this was not the same. It's also not ink.

Then, we tried the green tea mille crepes for $5.70. It was tiny and very very stale. I've had much better."}
{"text":"Shity and worst experience ever, this is my go to place but now. their fucked up. we ask for chicken curry but gave us beef curry instead. were being ask if we still want the chicken curry or just gave us 10% off, just 10% wow amazing! in most reatuarant they will say its on us but not this place tho. so we told them we will wait for new chicken curry but the dumb waiter didnt heard it so weve been waiting for few minutes for nothing. amazing services guys. great job."}
{"text":"This time I got the beef tenderloin noodle soup and it was pretty good! The broth was nice and the beef was perfect! I also got the fresh fruit mango slush and it never disappoints. Green grotto always includes big and small tapico in your drink if you ask for tapico, which I like! But if you don't like that, you should make that clear to them. 

And always free popcorn which is nice :)"}
{"text":"I come here really often and it's my favourite sit-down place to get BBT. This is a long overdue review.

VIBE 5/5
This is the main reason why I come. It's relatively quiet, not too busy most of the time, and has a nice sound track (with a range of jazz, bossa nova and soft acoustic pop). I come usually to meet up with friends, then do work after (or vice versa).

FOOD + DRINK 3/5
The bubble tea is often a little too sweet and the flavouring is meh - I recommend the roasted milk tea with whatever toppings (tapioca, grass jelly) with less sugar. I also recommend the malted milk tea with tapioca and less sugar. It's surprisingly good.

Dessert wise, it's pretty good. I love the grass jelly deserts but that's because I grew up with it and love it; it's not for everyone. If you're accustomed to sweet beans and tapioca and grass jelly, go for it! The best is the hot one during winter. 
Brick toast is not great, often dry and lacking in flavour (just sweet). Cakes are pretty average but decent. Expensive though (7.50 for a slice with ice cream). 

In general, Green Grotto can get pricy (around $6 + tax and tip for the drinks, and average of $7.50 for snack food, and average of $11 for a meal items). I really recommend the Fall/Winter lunch menu where you get a meal + drink for 10.99. They have it during the summer too but the selection is not as tasty (they don't have popcorn chicken or beef noodle soup).

SERVICE 2/5
Usually non-existent. Don't expect refills in water, if you get water at all. You usually pay at the counter. Slow-ish, and hit and miss with the friendliness. But the best thing is you don't ever really get kicked out, so you could stay for 4-5 hours. I usually do 2 orders if I'm staying from lunch to past dinner."}
{"text":"People stay long hours doing homework and whatnot so sometimes wait to get a table is long, but it's a nice comfy area to chill. Lots of selections of teas and cake. I got a berry cheesecake and it was still frozen so I had to ask to heat up a bit more."}
{"text":"I am very surprised as to how packed this place always is. Their drinks are standard. Nothing really special. The atmosphere is a bit loud but that's because the space is a bit crowded. It is a good place to just talk with friends but maybe not to study. They do have some variety of drinks. Their regular menu is your standard green teas and milk twas etc. And they also had a special menu that had some interesting drinks. I had a kumquat drink with aloe vera. First time I tried a drink like that. It tasted quite good. I don't know if I will be coming back. Its one of those places I only go if my friends ask to go."}
{"text":"After Green Grotto moved, it definitely became a much easier place to come to - as they have far more space as before and are no longer squished between two restaurants. However, if you're coming during a busy time - Friday nights or Saturday nights, expect to wait as they have hoards of people coming in and I would generally say that people take their time to have bbt, eat, play games & talk. 

I appreciate the Green Grotto is a chill space to hang out with people. I've never really been rushed out of a location, you are open to bring your own games and play, they give you free popcorn - waaaat! Their food, desserts and drinks are decent. But their atmosphere, free popcorn and decent staff create a safe space for you to come back to and spend time time with friends and family.

Go to are usually hokkaido milk tea ($5.49 for small). Their desserts are nothing amazing - typical out of package cakes that were bought. Their bubble tea flavours are nice, and they have quite a variety. Their food is okay - although we don't usually order food when we come. 

But it's a good place to go, nice to study there during the day with bubble tea, nice to hang out with friends in the afternoon/night."}
{"text":"I come here often for board game night with friends and the service is pretty misleading considering there's usually about 8 guys by the front kitchen and then like 3 girl servers that seem to never see your hand raise OR make eye contact with you when you need them. But the minute you don't need them they're suddenly everywhere and available lol

Also, it may take some time for your order to come through, so having patience is A MAJOR KEY to even be at this location at all! Unless you're here when it's completely dead then yeah ofc I would assume it'd be different.

Other than that, ambiance is pretty 'laxed, unless you're someone like me playing with your friends - then shit goes down real fast and quaint little inside voices quickly turn into BBHMM mode. You'll enjoy yourself here. Nothing crazy or special about the drinks nor food nor service. The decor is geek chic and poppy fresh so it's pleasant, but doesn't negate the fact that customer service skills are lacking and sometimes a smile would help lol."}
{"text":"This is a little expensive. The interior is amazing, looks like a 5-star hotel. Very clean and played soft jazz music in the background when we went there. I had the matcha pudding which wasn't amazing. My friend had their tiramisu cheese cake served with frosting- it was good. I would maybe come back just because the place looks nice and not because of the food."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Green Grotto so I was excited to hear that another location has opened up downtown (albeit very close to an existing one on St. Joseph)! This one is fairly spacious with lots of natural light due to the glass exterior. It feels modern and clean.

We got four drinks for everyone in our group - two milk black teas with tapioca and two slushies. They mixed up the sizing for two of the drinks but quickly fixed it. Green Grotto usually gives free popcorn to customers but at this location we had to ask for it vs. them offering but no big deal. They are doing a 20% off promo until the end of October.

Wifi connection is good. I would recommend coming here to catch up with friends or get some work done/study."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming...came to check out Destiny competition and found it loud, menu lacking and drinks average but cost is high for what you receive...."}
{"text":"An old favourite spot of mine to grab some bubble tea and relax with friends. The ambience is nice and peaceful. When it gets busy, it's still not too hectic. I've also never had an issue finding a table here, even during peak times.

Staff and okay for the most part, nothing particularly noteworthy. They are attentive to get your order initially and don't come by afterwards unless you call for them.

Drinks are pretty consistent all around. They have standard bubble tea drinks in a large variety of flavours and styles in their newly revamped menu.

Make sure to take advantage of the free bowls of popcorn while you're there! Granted that sometimes the popcorn is a little stale, it makes for a nice little snack."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times. The building itself is really nice and makes for a great spot to relax or even bring your laptop (free wifi!). It can get a bit busy in the evening (after 6 PM) but I usually go around noon to 3 PM and it's easy to get a table.

The taro hot milk frothie was a letdown for sure - it came out lukewarm and ended up being pretty meh. On the other hand, the cold rose floral tea is probably my favourite drink from Green Grotto. It's light, refreshing, and the subtle rose flavour is delicious. 

Prices are a bit higher than other bubble tea places, but they do have a wide selection that includes some pretty interesting and unique flavours."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend and although it was a bit of a walk from the UofT campus, the trek was worth it. Loved the colorful yet minimal aesthetic of the place and the floor to ceiling windows really added something different to the space. Before you even order anything, they provide you with complimentary popcorn served in a fancy gold container. They have a full menu for both lunch and dinner but on my visit there, I ordered the ramen (one of the lunch specials). The lunch specials come with bubble tea on the side but you can opt out of it if you wish. The service was a bit slow but overall my experience there was a positive one. The food tasted great and was pretty affordable as well."}
{"text":"I had once ordered their honey aloe drink and it tasted like sugar water. Little did I know it didn't consist of any tea. I asked if they could change it for me as it was a mistake as I had expected tea in it and they wouldn't do it, even though I tried to explain to them that I always come here I order their green teas and this one time I want to try something new and didn't like it. They still would not reason with me and pretty much told me that's my own problem and to leave and didn't want my business as they told me to go to Starbucks around the corner. What TERRIBLE customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing time at Green Grotto! A friend and I went to get some work done, and we were pleasantly surprised by the delicious food and excellent service. I ordered a popcorn chicken and a Taro bubble tea. My good was fantastic, I like that the tapioca of the bubble tea was smaller than regular places, the owners were thoroughly prepared with an extension cord when my laptop charger didn't fit in the outlet, and they brought out a complementary popcorn appetizer. I give this place five starts would for sure reccomend it and come back!"}
{"text":"The service was horrible, sitting down for 10 mins or more and no service was given. 7 staffs standing at the bar area, jus chatting away. No water was given , the service was unacceptable."}
{"text":"The food and drinks weren't bad, but the service was terrible. The servers and waitresses didn't understand English that well... 
I asked for water 4 times before I finally received it. They forgot about the cake that I had ordered 30 minutes ago. I asked for sweet chili sauce to go with my salt and pepper chicken, which I knew they had because they served spring rolls and they brought me hot sauce instead... yet my water still hasn't come??? 
On top of that, what really cut everything to be a bad experience for me is that the server came up to us and told us: \"hey, it's our last call. Do you want anything else?\" I said yes, and asked for the menu again. I quickly ordered within the next 2 minutes because I also work at a restaurant and I'm aware of how the chefs want to leave quickly. The server told me that he had to check on the kitchen... because they might have closed, despite his last call. The server came back and said, \"they are closing the kitchen because they don't really want to make another order... The kitchens closed.\" Excuse me? Last call means this is the last round of orders going into the kitchen BEFORE they leave... and you don't want to make another order? What line of service do you work in.... It is absurd that they asked us for last call and then promptly dismissed us with the fact that the kitchen was closed. Why give us a menu and allow us to order in the first place when the kitchen was already closed?"}
{"text":"Nice place to sit and chat for a couple hours. They have a seating limit of 3 hours but I don't know if they enforce it.

There's a shelf full of various reading materials that you can use if you like.

They offer a complimentary bowl of popcorn. If you don't get one, take the initiative to ask. They have a rule that each customer must order an item, but if you're going to be there for a couple hours it seems justified.

I like the Ali Shan tea that they offer. You get a nice big pot served on a wooden tray, and unlimited hot water re-fills. It's a plain black pot, but it's got its own aesthetics. Make sure to take the leaves out so you're not steeping them for too long, so that you can re-use the leaves a few more times.

They've got a pretty big menu offering all sorts of foods and drinks. I don't really come here for food so my 4-star rating does not take those into consideration. I just know I like the tea that I get."}
{"text":"I have been to more than half of the green grotto in the city, this location looks fancy but it doesn't deserve to be the flagship store. Food is as usual but experience was not pleasent. Servers refused to let us sit in the couches though half of the store was empty."}
{"text":"The place looks amazing. Excellent decor, foosball in the middle, lots of magazines, some board games, lots of seating space, a private room in the back for groups, and clean washrooms.

However, that's about it.
We came in around 7:30 PM on a friday night but the place was empty.

Food is not good. One of the rice noodle dishes had a particularly burnt flavor and I'm not sure if it was because of rancid oil or they just burnt it. Popcorn chicken wasn't hot, and the san bei chicken had very little chicken overall.

Didn't try any drinks."}
{"text":"I've been to their old location  a couple of years ago but it was never memorable. Same goes to this newer location which is only steps from their old place. The only thing I like was the ambiance of this place very cozy. The drinks and snacks are something  you can get at a chinese food court that would even taste better. I got a bowl of supposedly hot tapioca,mixed beans, rice cakes etc...but it was lukewarm in some area and nothing was hot... Some parts were still cold! That's an indication of microwave food.  I came for cooked or fresh snacks not microwave food!!! The sugar level was over powering and it's all premade so it's not an option for more or less sugar. I took a couple of slurp and gave up it was totally gross.  It's a teen to early 20ish hangout establishment. Though there's nothing  wrong with teens hanging out there but it can get rowdy if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"I really like all the Green Grotto bubble tea locations. They all provide you free popcorn once you sit down to munch on while you wait for the rest of your food/drinks. They have plenty of Asian magazines to read if that's your type of thing. 

My favourite thing is that they have mixed size tapioca for all their drinks. Some people I know don't like this, but I love it! I have their points card too, but I don't exactly remember how the points system works. 

During peak times, this gets really packed and since people go there to hang out, there's not a lot of turnover of tables. I've been forced to get takeout a few times because there were no seats available."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food is always good.  Dessert is very delish!  Trio braised platter is must try."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the time on Saturday afternoon but it wasn't too loud so great for conversation. Speed of service was average. Food was delivered timely and was good. Price was good too. Overall really no complaints for your average bubble tea place.  For some reason it can't compare to when it first opened on the other side of the Plaza. Not sure what about it is different,  maybe the quality of their bubble tea?"}
{"text":"This a brand new Green Grotto located on the corner of Bay and Grosvenor.  The location is big, bright and modern.  Their are large murals of abstract art decorating the walls and panes of painted glass hanging from the ceiling.  The atmosphere is welcoming when you first enter the store.  You are greeted by friendly staff who are there to either guide you to an empty table or to place a takeout order.  
Given the limited time I had, I could only order a take out drink.  I got the Matcha Milk green tea with grass jelly.   The drink came out to be $6.49 plus taxes, but with their soft opening you will receive 20% off your order which brought the drink to $5.86 for a large size.   Without the 20% discount the drink would have been quite expensive.   Service was a bit slow, but I'm hopeful it'll improve when the staff have a better handle on the inner workings of the place .  As I've mentioned before, they're probably still working out some kinks since my order was incorrect.  I asked for no ice, and my cup was half full of it.  I'll return to try their food another time and see whether if it's worthy of becoming rostered on my lunch meals."}
{"text":"I've been here 2 times now. Service was always really slow. Food portions were so small for price. It's a nice ambience so if you wanted to go for coffee/bubble tea/dessert & study it would be fine."}
{"text":"I like Green Grotto! Their food portions are decent (if you are a small eater, the portions will be just fine). For those with big appetites you may find it a bit small but come with friends who don't eat much and eat their leftovers ;) / this is what my girl friends and I do. GG bubble tea is delicious and they offer free bowls of popcorn for refill. Prices are your typical Taiwanese bubble tea shop price, ranging from $3.99 to $15 depending on your order. Service is quite fast and the food satisfied my hunger. The food is authentic and inoffensive - not too salty, just right. I frequent this place quite a bit as it is near my church which is just steps away (TCCC, which is behind the plaza) so my church friends and I come here after service sometimes. It's spacious & great for groups!"}
{"text":"K ordered the Lavender Floral Tea and Sausage & Minced Pork on Rice with Egg while I got the Hot Formosa Bowl (Hot Gelatin Grass Jelly, QQ Ball, Sweet Potato, Sweet Taro, and Tapioca).

The glasses that they use have their logo of a little plant which I found so adorable!

The Floral Tea in a Pot (Lavender)  wasn't aesthetically pleasing as I thought it would be.  It was a plain teapot with the lavender tea leaves in the strainer but the lavender tea smelled amazing!  Lavender helps you to de-stress and relax and that's what I felt like when I sniffed the aroma in.  The taste of the tea was full-bodied and good too.

The Minced Pork on Rice with Egg looked disgusting.  It's only now when I'm posting that I realized they forgot to give us an egg!  What the heck.  The bowl wasn't tasty at all; everything was quite mushy and didn't taste fresh.  K said they probably microwaved the entire thing from the fridge. 

I also thought that my Hot Formosa Bowl looked really bad.  I only hoped it tasted good even if its appearance was lacking.  At first, I compared it to regular grass jelly but hot gelatin grass jelly apparently is a mucky mess.  I wish they didn't put in syrup in it because I would have liked a more natural taste.  The sweet potato and sweet taro were indeed too sweet for my taste.  The QQ balls and tapioca were meh.  

We both thought that this location didn't seem to be very good; the Warden and Steeles location seems better.  They also don't serve any popcorn at this location!"}
{"text":"I am really disappointed as this was my go to bubble tea spot in Toronto. 
Ever since their menu changed I noticed a drop in service as well as the quality of food. 
Everything seems to be \"sold out\". Why even have a new menu when the items on the menu are unavailable every single time?

I used to come here every single weekend but I've run out of patience and won't be returning."}
{"text":"3 words. Hokkaido Milk Tea. 

I haven't been to bubble tea in a while. It's difficult living in the city, and when I used to live in the burbs, Ten Ren and Go For Tea was the newest franchise. So when I visited Green Grotto, it was like I was in there for the first time. 

Lots of choose from on the menu, but I haven't seen Hokkaido Milk Tea on any other menu before. Best Choice Ever. Although next time I will get a large and with no tapioca. It's sweet and creamy and not bitter. 

On a Sunday afternoon, the place was filled with people studying or doing work. Laptops, phones and tablets open on almost every other table. There are couches and normal tables, with people working. These kids now a day with multiple devices on their desk. 

They give you a bi bowl of popcorn to snack on which is a nice addition. 

The take out counter is also big with a nice waiting area. 

The only thing about the place, since it was packed, is that it really needed a ceiling fan or better air circulation. It was a little stuffy. 

Would be back up here next time for my bbt fix."}
{"text":"After trying to scout for a coffee place nearby, I discovered Green Grotto instead. The drink menu was very extensive and after looking at it for about 10 minutes, I still couldn't decide whether I should get a  coffee drink. I decided to give in and ordered the Hokkaido Milk Tea instead. It was very tasty and creamy. 

I also decided to get one of the small mini cakes. Please do yourself a favor and don't... I feel like they were not freshly made the day of. 

Although I couldn't stay and took out, I feel the ambiance is a very relaxing place if it doesn't get too packed. But on a Monday afternoon, there was very little people."}
{"text":"Went to Green Grotto because we were craving desserts and bubble tea! Green Grotto is also a pretty good study spot, since they have outlets, food and drinks, and a washroom in this location.

We were handed our menus right after being seated down. Coming in around 1 PM, there was still a decent crowd as there were a few others who were studying in the corners. Complementary popcorn was given not long after we sat down - one of the perks of visiting Green Grotto.

They had an array of cakes and it was so hard to pick just one! We ordered the Creme Brulee Cheesecake, which was pretty good. Although the \"creme brulee\" portion of the cake wasn't that caramelized, but it was still decent enough to add to the cheesecake flavour.

And while we're here, might as well satisfy our bubble tea cravings too right? Hahaha. Mango Slush, given with a spoon to scoop out the excess slush.

I originally wanted the Tiramisu cake, but they didn't have that, so I settled for the Chocolate Truffle cake instead. It was rich and super chocolate-y, which I loved. Each bite of the cake just melted in my mouth, which was divine. I took a close-up shot of the cake, which shows the different layers of chocolate-y goodness  .

I also ordered a Lychee Green Tea with tapioca for myself (pictured bottom left).

We were both pretty full at the end of our dessert session! We didn't have to wait long for our orders and food timing was good because our bubble teas came first, and then our cakes. Had a very positive experience here. Plus, dessert time is definitely a good way to catch up with friends  !

Also didn't realize this until we left, but they forgot to charge for my Chocolate Truffle cake, since there was like a back-and-forth thing going on (my original cake wasn't available, the server presented me with the menu again, I took some time to look at it and decide, then I ordered the Chocolate Truffle...). So I guess they forgot to punch in the order for the cake at the end of it.

Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a cafe to study at, or a chill/dessert place to hang out! I've also gotten take out bubble tea from this location as well. Plus, if you're planning for a long day of studying, they do have meals available here besides dessert - be sure to ask for the seats with plugs/chargers as well if you're using a laptop or tablet."}
{"text":"I was a bit sad after a long stint without good bubble tea. My soul was crying for the icy goodness of taro and lychee bursting bubbles. My friend Serena brought me to Green Grotto and I feel ready to begin anew. The cheesecake was awesome, the milk teas were perfect and the ambience was spot on. I love you Green Grotto. I love you oh so tenderly. You are mine forever..."}
{"text":"Honestly, the drinks are great and the location is convenient and beautiful. But there is one thing that has tainted my experience and that's the customer service. 

I've come often enough to know that the booths always have a \"reserved\" sign on it. I normally always see couples working in the booths together with their laptops and I figured it'd be a nice way to work on some things. 

So I give them a call because I assume that you need to reserve it. When they picked up, the person had no clue what I was trying to ask for. She asked if we wanted to study or if we were just eating and I said both and that we would require an outlet for our laptops. After 5 minutes of explaining that I'd just like to reserve a booth for two people, she puts the phone down to ask a manager or colleague about it- I didn't realize it was so hard to make a reservation?

They came back and said that the booth is normally for bigger groups but if it wasn't busy then they'll accommodate. So, I said sure and they took my name down. I assumed that was the \"reservation.\" 

Upon arriving, they were absolutely clueless about the call and I asked again if we could have the booth since it wasn't busy. Mind you, this was a MONDAY afternoon at 2pm. They refused and made us sit at another table where the outlet was far away. So after begrudging sitting on the uncomfortable seat for a few hours, the place started getting busy. 

And what do you know, at least 2-3 of those booths had only two people in them. 

A similar comment/review has been posted on their Facebook page by someone else. The reviewer assumed it was a race issue which honestly could be it. But in my opinion, I just think it was awful customer service which has left a pretty bad taste in my mouth and I don't really want to go back again although I've been a regular for a long time now. 

Like the past reviewer said, have some consistency in your rules of who gets to sit in the booths and stick with it."}
{"text":"I am a local and me and my friends love to come here for a late night chat, bubble tea run, snack run, you name it. First off, the setting of the place and design is a very nice cafe-setting with a ping-pong table in the middle with large bookshelves full of board games and books/magazines to borrow for free while you enjoy your stay. 

DRINKS: I personally love their most popular drink which is the hokkaido milk tea. The drinks are usually on the sweeter side, so I'd suggest asking for \"less sugar\" in your drink. The image attached is their strawberry yogurt smoothie. 

FOOD: Food pricing is average but some of their apps are on the pricer side. They have very good popcorn chicken. Other than that, I wouldn't go here for a full meal because their apps are quick and fast and ready to serve rather than a seemingly microwaveable meal. 

Customer service: I've been here at least 10 times and believe me, their staff and the manager who I see almost every time are genuinely nice and are always providing me with great service. They are soft-spoken but are also very welcoming to their guests."}
{"text":"I seriously love coming here for bubble tea. The atmosphere here is just so chill and the interior is so cute. I would definitely recommend this place for a date!
The snack items are a bit overpriced, but their lunch specials are a pretty good deal and are tasty. The bubble tea here uses both the bigger balls of tapioca as well as the smaller ones which I personally really enjoy. Typically, I always upgrade my drink to a large size as it's just more worth it. The large drinks are seriously huge and if you can't finish just ask them to make it to go for you after. Keep in mind though that if you are coming with a group, everyone has to order something in order to stay.
My favourite drink is the rose green tea with tapioca. Go check it out."}
{"text":"Green Grotto has certainly earned an upgraded rating from my first post I have written about them. 
The ambiance, decor, service, menu selection have been pretty much the same and consistent throughout all the numerous visits I have made during the past year. 
In terms of recommendation in what to order, I strongly recommend Hokkaido Black Milk Tea, Okinawa Black Milk Tea, and the Matcha Red Bean Milk Tea as any of those selections are full of flavour with the right amount of creaminess and sweetness. 
Green Grotto does get noisy and busy during the peak hours of its nightly service, but it is still a great place to be if you are looking for a place to relax, study, or spend time with some friends."}
{"text":"What seems to happen to all restaurants that expand too fast seems to be happening to Green Grotto.  We used to love the one in Markham (Warden) and visited when we could.  But I see the menu has changed and I'm not too enamored with it.  The food is still fine, but the service!  After 15 minutes of sitting there at lunch time, and it wasn't that busy, I walked out.  None of the disinterested girls walking around with frowns on their faces felt obliged to walk over and take an order.  I saw more than one table trying to wave them frantically.  I would still go back for the food, but if I ever have another service experience like that, never again."}
{"text":"Yelp's description of two-stars is perfect: \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" I've been coming to this place for about a year now, and although it's my usual spot for some boba and board games, this place leaves so much to be desired. 

The milk teas (Hokkaido, etc.) are good, but anything else, such as the Oolong teas, are over-steeped and taste bitter and burnt. The small tapioca option often clumps together in one mass and clogs the straw, but the big pearls are made fine. There's also little use in trying to inform the staff if it's made incorrectly or tastes bad because they still don't let you switch your drink or have it re-made. If I'm paying ~$7 for an item, I would at the very least expect it to be made properly.

The food here is fine - not my personal preference though. They offer lots of pork options, but I don't personally eat pork so I don't eat here much other than the free popcorn that they give you when you dine in, which is nice. Keep in mind there's a max of two small buckets of free popcorn per table. When you DO order food, however, it's pretty good if it's something you fancy. I like crispy chicken, so I can say the salt and pepper chicken here is pretty good.

The overall? atmosphere is unchanged; relaxing bossa nova music, fun games to try, foosball, and an overall cozy and cute aesthetic inside. The place is nice and clean, and it would be unusual to find this place busy, even on a weekend night.

Certain members of the staff here are very nice (unfortunately, only one or two of their staff comes to mind) but most staff are cold and rushed, even though the place sees very little traffic throughout the day. One of the newer staff members constantly snorts his mucous and blows his nose loudly in the front bar area which is quite honestly disgusting and makes me nauseous just drinking/eating here. It also goes against food industry and service standards. This fact alone would likely deter me from returning to this place, especially since there are so many other good options in Vaughan these days.

Again, the same thing as my previous reviews applies to Green Grotto; it has potential. But unfortunately it's been a while now and they haven't made any efforts to improve, so I've chosen to factor out \"potential\" in my review to stop reviewing it for what it could be and review it for what it is."}
{"text":"I've been here countless number of times when I was back in HS and still do nowadays. I remember when this Green Grotto used to be a part of plaza before renting out the entire space near Boston Pizza. I LOVE the quality of their bubble teas - in my opinion, it is my all-time favourite place for bubble tea as their flavours are rich and creamy. My favourite (and the drink that I always get) is their hokkaido milk tea. I also love how unique their tapioca is as they have tapioca ranging of various sizes from small to large. The free popcorn is also a huge tip as well and it's some of the best popcorn I've ever had. When my friends come here and chill, we always grab bowls and bowls of popcorn while browsing on the Internet! The overall ambience and atmosphere of the new Green Grotto is really nice. The seats are comfy and spacious and allows people to do work on their laptops with ease. 

Definitely one of my favourite places to chill with friends during the night. 

Tip: You get 10% off on all take-out drinks!"}
{"text":"I was so unhappy when I came here. BlogTO sucks. Also service here is below mediocre. Servers have no clue what theyre doing or saying, I was given the wrong food TWICE. overpriced. Did not clarify my order, charged me extra for their mistake and the noodles? Just literally instant noodles from a package. Never coming back. 

Food tasted average, like food court specials for $5. Fish ball fries were interesting.
Drink's are okay, watery.

When they got my drink wrong all 5 working behind the counter just had their hands over their mouths laughing. What if I was deathly allergic to their mistake?

What an embarrassment. 

If the service was better, I might have not been so displeased with the overall experience but nope.
1/5 service.
1/5 Food.
3/5 atmosphere. Beautiful building, the building didnt do anything wrong.
:)"}
{"text":"This is a favourite place of mine, my sister, and my friends. The food is so yummy and we always look forward to the free, unlimited popcorn. I sit here for hours and hours either studying (with my sister) or chatting (with my friends) and we come back here at least twice a year! Love it so much!!"}
{"text":"The concept is cute, and they offer popcorn if you dine in. However if you dine in, the drinks are more expensive and you have to tip.

The service was relatively slow and the workers don't really pay any attention to you. Even when the place was empty, we requested to sit in the couch area but were refused because we were only a party of two. 

The service sucks so if you want the bubble tea, just do take out."}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming. This place has a beautiful interior but the food and drinks aren't worth the price. You do get a free bucket of popcorn so if you're looking for a light snack, it saves you from having to order any of their deep fried snacks. 

It could make a good study spot, but there are plenty of other cafes and bubble tea shops with better drinks. I got the matcha milk tea, which was quite average while my friend got the Ferrero blended drink which tasted like watered down chocolate slush. 

If you're looking for quality tea, I'd pass on this place because there are a bunch of other places nearby with much better drinks. However, if you just want a place to chill out/study then this place might be good for you."}
{"text":"Green grotto is a two minute walk from my house so it's at a very convenient location. 

The drinks I've tried so far are pretty good. My favourite here would be the Hokkaido milk tea or the strawberry slush. The drinks here are also really sweet so I always ask for less sugar. One thing that threw me off was the grass jelly. I'm used to the taste of grass jelly from sharetea and cha time. The grass jelly at Green Grotto has this Chinese medicine kind of taste to it which I'm not a fan of. 

The food here is pretty standard. It's what you'd find at every Taiwan tea house. The popcorn chicken here is pretty good, it's less salty than other places and has the right amount of flavour. 

There's plenty of seating in this tea shop, magazines to read, board games, and even a foosball table which is pretty cool. It's definitely a nice place to hang out with friends or to study."}
{"text":"(Food:)
I come here often because they always give free popcorn with your order.  They also come with free refills heh!

Drinks are also quite adequate, with the tapioca being chewy and you are allowed to choose your drink sweetness as well!

(Price:)
Standard

(Ambience:)
I like that there are couches to sit on if you want to, or larger tables for bigger groups of people.  You can also stay for quite a long time to get your studying and work done.  Wifi is quite good!

(Overall:)
I come here so often, so it must be good right?"}
{"text":"The design/interior of this location is nice. Unfortunately the bubble tea itself was very disappointing. We ordered two drinks and left both of them more than half full. The tea tasted like it was steeped for too long, to the point where it was bitter. With five other bubble tea chains within walking vicinity, there isn't much room for error. This green grotto falls last on the list. I'm unable to comment on the food, but I'm hoping it's better than the bubble tea.

This review only refers to the Bay Street location. I've had great experiences at the other locations."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow to get my order and the chicken wings took longer than I expected 

The popcorn was a nice touch to have me picking at something while I waited

The bubble tea was great for the summer green tea, unfortunately it came with the fruit balls at the bottom as I forgot to ask not none, however I wasn't asked when ordering either which normally they do

Wings came with plenty of sauce and well presented, nice crispy skin but not too much meat to chow down on 

Bubble tea was better than any we have in the uk"}
{"text":"Official Green Grotto Location Power-Rankings:

2) ***This place***(Bay and College)
3) Warden and Steeles
4) Gal's Sushi Plaza (Hwy 7 and Warden)

TBD: Bay and Bloor, Mcnicoll

This is the 2nd best Green Grotto according to my expert opinion. 2nd place is good...if you're okay with silver medals, drinking Pepsi, Samsung smartphones, and settling for mediocrity. As someone wise once said, \"If you're not first, you're last.\"

Why would they want to be 1st anyways? More outlets would just make it the perfect place for studying in the heart of downtown for Ryerson and UofT students. Non-burnt popcorn would appease their patrons and entice them to visit more often. And lowering their prices would take away business from nearby restaurants and cafés. After careful analysis, I can definitely see why they would not want to improve themselves to be the best Green Grotto."}
{"text":"Green Grotto has a wide selection of drinks, snacks, and food! While I liked the variety in the menu, I didn't like what I ordered thaaat much. I had the Hokkaido milk tea drink because it's one of the first things I saw on the menu and had a \"1\" labelled on it which I assume makes it a popular choice. It was okay but not the best - lacked flavour but still tasty. You won't really find this flavour of milk tea anywhere else around this area though. For snacks, I got condensed butter milk toast and I was not very impressed - the bread tasted too buttery and there wasn't enough condensed milk for this dish to taste like how it's supposed to. If you've ever ordered this snack at another Chinese restaurant, you'll know what I mean! 

The service is pretty standard and the prices are a bit on the higher end for bubble tea and snacks. The environment however is really cool - it's a great place to hang out and catch up with friends. There are lots of board games and a foose ball table for you to play."}
{"text":"Busy Saturday night (not surprised) but the customer service I received was excellent. Def recommend the White Peach Green Tea if anyone is a fruit tea person. It has the peach taste but it's a bit lighter. Also had a Chocolate Brownie Cheesecake, my favourite. I wouldn't really recommend it though unless you love sweets because it is very sweet haha."}
{"text":"It was my first time going there last night and it was a pretty good experience. Like any other late night cafes, this place was packed with others and we had to wait for the waiter to take us to our seats. Although it gets pretty busy most of the time, the speed of the service wasn't extreme slow which was acceptable as I was chatting with my friends while we waited for our order. We ordered a large Lemon Green Tea, a large White Peach Oolong Tea,  a Very Berry Cheesecake and a plate of Takoyaki (octopus balls) and they were all pretty good. They also gave out free popcorns and refilled it from time to times. According to the waiter, there is a minimum order of at least 1 order per person so we had to order another item since I was sharing a drink with another person. The area was pretty relaxing as there were coaches and book shelves there. The noise level was also decent, good enough to finish papers due the next day. The waiters were all pretty polite and we will for sure visit for another time."}
{"text":"$4.79 pineapple yogurt drink, regular size. I've never ordered a pineapple flavored drink, and I've never ordered a yogurt drink before. This is what happens after Japanese AYCE. For the price, this is not bad, I don't think. Usually, yogurt drinks are more expensive than this, no? Pineapple flavor was artificial, but definitely pineapple. Yogurt taste was there too. Also had a sip of my friend's rose flavored drink. Definitely floral. Also almost lychee? 

We came after 12am. Kitchen was closed. Service was sub par. It would have been nice to have some tissue on the table. Are the drinks usually served in takeout cups? Do we usually have to go up and pay? So many questions. So tired."}
{"text":"Was ok drink was still too sweet after I asked for no sugar.

Tapioca was missing the small tapioca. 

I like how if you need a place to work you can go there but there is time limitation if you go during busy times.

I'm never a fan of their cakes cause it does not look fresh and who now how long they've been sitting in theses boxes."}
{"text":"So My husband and I went here for a late night snack . I ordered an aloe ice tea and husband ordered a gingseng tea. The decor of the place is nice but customer service not so much. I guess the waiter was tried. The thing I didn't like is that the waiter took a while before bringing m slice of cheese cake . When he did take it out from the back , he looked at the plate for moment. Said some to the other guy walked half way to us then back to his co worker. Both looked at us a few times and then the plate. After a few seconds he moved the cheesecake to a new plate. My husband thought that was odd . I would recommend the straws with plastic or paper covers on it. Sometimes the same guy that serves you is the one handling the cashier.  I don't see any hand washing ."}
{"text":"This is the spot I always end up going to whenever I have a big paper due, or whenever I need to study for an exam. The interior is nicely done, with wooden designs and modern decor. I really like it here because it's a chill place to do my work, and they don't limit your time while sitting here. I've been here for over 4 hours once and they didn't say anything. They also don't limit your wifi like panera does, as a way to kick you out.

Most of the spots have access to an outlet, which is a plus. They're also very courteous to reseating you if you don't like your current spot. I really like the spots at the high table, because of easy outlet access + no cold breeze coming from outside + comfy chairs with a good view. Service is pretty quick and courteous.. let's just say that they deserve their tip!

For the food/drink, I'd say they're about mediocre. There's nothing really special about them, especially if you're familiar with other asian places that serve the same things. I don't particularly like their meals here, and I'd never come here intentionally to eat.. their brick toast is average, tasting the same as other places that would offer it. Drink wise- again, average. Nothing too unique. I always go for their rose green tea, which has a light flavour & it's not too sweet. I find a lot of their other drinks to be overloaded with sugar and just makes me feel sick after awhile. Don't know if you can change the level. I also never get mine with tapioca because the variety of the pearl shapes makes it feel like I'm eating bugs. Small tapioca balls should not be a thing. I also got the grass jelly here once and it was uncut- it was literally an entire can of grass jelly dumped into a milk tea LOL.. so unappealing and difficult to ingest.

And final verdict is that of course I'll be back.. you'll catch me here around exam time."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday evening around 7pm. The restaurant was not packed, but had customers inside, which was good as we did not have to wait to get seated and the noise level was not too high. I like the setting inside the restaurant, they have comfortable chairs with cushion, nice lighting (If I remember well, there was a chandelier?), a bookshelf where lots of Asian magazines were available for people to read (including Japanese!). 

We were served with a bowl of popcorn free of charge while we were ordering. My boyfriend and I ordered the \"Maccha\" Affogato, Pistachio chocolate crunch mousse and Crème Brulée Cheesecake. The price for these orders is reasonable, between $5 and $7. They have a good variety of both sweet and savoury foods, and it was not easy for us to make a final decision on what to order (they all look and seem delicious!) Indeed, their desserts were yummy. I will definitely go there again to try out their savoury foods and new desserts :)

{"text":"Green grotto is a great place to hangout, and chill with snacks and drinks. I really enjoyed it here and will certainly be back. 

This is a really cozy place, and had a very relaxed atmosphere. It's rather dimly lit but there's enough natural lighting. It wasn't too busy when we were there (late afternoon) which is great but did start to get more busy, and louder later in the day. 

Food wise I can't say much but overall, it was good enough. I was certainly not there for the food so it didn't need to be spectacular. The free popcorn was awesome as a little finger snack. Had the pistachio chocolate crunch cake which was nice. Not overly sweet, and was a light dessert. Also got the strawberry black tea in a pot. The first pot was rather sweet. Nothing super special but service was good enough to refill the pot with warm water two times without asking. You might have minor trouble flagging down service but it isn't that bad. The menu seemed decent but I probably wouldn't go and get actual food here.

There's free WiFi without a password (there's a 'login' page but it's essentially hassle free - just need to wait 10 seconds). It's somewhat reliable and quick enough from what I experienced? But I wasn't consistently using it."}
{"text":"had the bbq eel over rice and the sugar cane milk tea with grass jelly and both were amazing! could have included more vegetables in the bowl but overall well balanced in variety of vegetables. the sugar cane milk tea was not too sweet and seemed like a popular choice: was not disappointed with my order. food came fast with pleasant service; would come again next time i am in markham"}
{"text":"Green Grotto has a theme that definitely lives up to its name - the bird and forest motifs hidden in various nooks and crannies throughout the restaurant, the wooden panelling, the somewhat dim lighting, and the caged chandeliers bring to mind a glamorous clubhouse hidden away in some enchanted forest. There's a certain coziness to Green Grotto with the couches, the Asian magazines and the board games. 

The Hokkaido smoothie that I had was amazing! I highly recommend getting it. The eel in the eel bowl that I had was good but it could have been better - I wasn't too thrilled about the tamago since there was definitely a difference in temperature between the tamago and the rest of the ingredients in the bowl (tamago was cooler than the eel, rice and veggies). It's certainly a first being served popcorn as an appetizer. At first, I found it a bit weird that I was having popcorn as an app. But then I thought, why not? It's Green Grotto's thing. It also adds to the coziness factor of the restaurant. 

What I didn't like about Green Grotto was the following: the bathrooms weren't the cleanest, the poor wifi (it worked when I logged in the first time, but as soon as I would stop using my phone, it would log me out and I would have to log back in again. After a few times of logging back in, I was unable to connect to the wifi and I had to continue the rest of my lunch break without free wifi) and the waiters were not very attentive. My Hokkaido drink took some time to arrive at my table. I witnessed a couple being seated and then leaving after a long time in attempting to attract the staff's attention. 

Overall, the Green Grotto on Warden was okay for me. Perhaps I'll visit other locations and see how they compare to this one."}
{"text":"I come solely for their lunch menus and the atmosphere. They have large booths on the side perfect for group lunching or group chatting or even group studying (bear in mind that they do have a 2 hour seating limit). 

Their lunch menu is okay (rice or ramen based meal with a regular or milk tea). The food is good but their drinks are pretty artificial and uses plenty of syrups. The general atmosphere is amazing with high ceilings, floor to ceiling windows and light accents."}
{"text":"We were in the area and stopped at Green Grotto for a bubble tea over the weekend.

They store is large and spacious and they had a good menu with a large selection of snacks and bubble tea, as well as some hot drinks and food.

I ordered a small winter-melon green tea with regular ice and sugar.  The drink was served in a regular small size glass.  The ingredients, sugar and ice came in the right amounts and the drink was good.  (unexceptional, but I got what I ordered and what I expected)

The serving staff was friendly.  The place was fairly full and the staff looked pretty busy rushing moving from table to table but they managed to be fast, friendly and efficient.

Some extra things we enjoyed were the free wifi offered at the store, the comfortable sofa seats that they seated us in and complimentary popcorn that they served us.

Overall, a solid experience with an extra 0.5 points for the excellent extras.

{"text":"Food: 3 Stars
Service: 3 Stars
Ambience: 4 Stars

This was my first time here and I had no idea what this place was when me and my partner decided to walk in. It was relatively busy when we walked in but was seated promptly. We were given an option of sitting at a regular table or the soft seats but with a very low table. My recommendation is if you are eating a meal (desserts are ok) to choose the regular seats as the low tables are VERY low and it was not easy eating on them.

Our order consisted of four items: mango slush, tomato onion pork chop, grass jelly Formosa, and the spicy pork tossed noodle.
The mango slush was not bad and made of real mango (or so we were told) as opposed to the smoothie which is not. The pork chop is your typical sweet and sour pork flavour and the meat was alright, nothing particularly special. My partner is fairly picky when it comes to noodles and they did not like how it was prepared here. I tasted it myself and did not find anything wrong with it however (enjoyed the spiciness of it).
The item we enjoyed the most was the grass jelly Formosa. It was a fairly warm day outside so this was really refreshing as we both love grass jelly.

The service here was fairly average mainly because there were only two staff working the tables. The staff member that seated us seemed to be the one taking orders from most of the tables so he was extremely busy while other members of staff seemed to help out here and there. This made it very difficult to get the attention of the staff and we ended up giving up after trying to get a glass of water.

The space here is nice. Feels very spacious and clean. It is a very relaxed environment with groups of people playing board games, watching movies and doing work on their laptops. It is a nice place to just hang out with friends and grab some snacks and drinks. One thing I did notice was that the seats were pretty beat down. The seat I was sitting at was in pretty bad shape with pieces of the seat coming off and a large section of the cushion below exposed.

Overall this is a pretty cool place to just chill with friends. Food was nothing special but it was serviceable. Next time I come I will probably stick with desserts and drinks."}
{"text":"I heard about Green Grotto through BlogTO on Facebook and I immediately wanted to go see the Bay Street location. The place is really beautiful; high ceilings, good space for groups, cute decor etc. The service was also amazing and the food was great. We ordered bowls of soup and they were huge LOL unexpected but I'm not complaining. We also ordered the fried set (can't remember what it was called exactly) but it had fried seafood, tofu, chicken etc. Their drinks were not only delicious but it's aesthetic, good for the gram lool  The only drawback for me is the price; it's not super expensive but not exactly cheap either. Overall, I really recommend this place for families, friends or if you're by yourself and need a place to eat/study"}
{"text":"The place is pretty cute. It has a stack of books and magazines on the wall. It's a little noisy when the place is full, but what bubble tea place isn't?

Three of us sat down. I ordered their #2 Jelly trio drink since it was popular, and sad to say, this is probably one of the worst tasting bubble teas I've tasted. The pearls aren't bad, but the drink tastes like bad licorice. The #1 drink was mediocre. The pearls are better at the Cha Time downtown and at Ten Rens.  The milk tea is really weak. Prices are better than Go for Tea and about the same as Destiny's, but the quality is just not there.

On top of the poorly made beverages, one of us wasn't really wanting to order anything just yet since she couldn't decide, and the staff came by and said there was a minimum order of 1 item per person otherwise there would be a charge for sitting, which is unheard of when there's no line up to get seated. What if I came with 5 people and wanted to order 3 snacks? Anyways, that was disappointing since there wasn't even anyone waiting for seating. They are money grabbers.

Suffice to sat, it's not a place worth coming to. Don't bother. It's not worth coming to. So terribly disappointing."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot (back when it was smaller and next to Keung's delight). 
They used to have this caramel milk tea which was bomb but for some reason it was discontinued along with their baked mochis with ice cream. (Green grotto owners if you see this review you know what to do to get your 5th star)

They give free popcorn and they do not limit your stay to a certain number of hours.

I had their popcorn chicken with rice and their dish was flavorful but their portions were small for $10. The kimchi on the side had a strong spicy kick to it which i loved. Their drinks tend to be a bit on the sweet side so ask for less sugar. I had a fresh milk green tea and found it a smidge too sweet.

They also have a free bottle of milk tea with the purchase of $20 right now. The bottle is of a topless man which feels like it pays homage to the magic mike movies. I got a bottle of hokkaido milk tea and it too is a bit too sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"The food is solid enough to justify a good environment for board games. However, the customer service is atrocious. Truly, every time I've been there the service was terrible. Normally, I could deal with lackluster service if everything is good, but I cannot give this place a pass."}
{"text":"Perfect place to gather with friends. Menu selection is great and the place is really cosy! Love hanging out there for the afternoon!!"}
{"text":"Mango slush is amazing! Would highly recommend! Price is a little high, but reasonable for a bubble tea shop that serves UNLIMITED POPCORN! Its definitely movie theatre quality! This place just became my new go to bubble tea place! 

P. S although they don't have board games, you can purchase a pack of cards from them for $2 which was convenient."}
{"text":"After venturing to Aijisen Ramen, both of us were craving something sweet and savory.  Thankfully Green Grotto was in the vicinity. Upon entering we came here early, so there were not issues finding a seat.  Known for its desserts, light snacks and hot meals it's no wonder why this cozy environment is a popular hang out, the ambiance is relaxing, with earth toned decor and book shelves at the back if you wish to pick up a magazine to read.

To crave her dessert urge Jen ordered their Raspberry Pistachio Cake, quite beautiful! it almost looked like a watermelon, but nonetheless the presentation was beyond our expectation. 

As for me I ended up ordering their Macha espresso affogato, this was a great dessert drink, filled with ice, coffee, espresso, ice cream topped off with Matcha! quite a flavorful one I must say. If Matcha isn't your flavor, they've got a range of others such as Taro, chocolate, etc. 

Overall great place to hang out whether for dessert or a meal.  Their menu is extensive with those who choose to dine in for a hot meal."}
{"text":"I've been here twice - both times for drinks. It's a nice atmosphere with high ceilings and solid decor and music, but the tables are a bit cramped and awkward. Prices are comparable with other Green Grotto restaurants and places nearby - rather high and not really worth the price. They give you complementary popcorn, but it's either burnt or not quite popped yet, so that's a slight disappointment. The hot drink I had was more lukewarm than hot and the cold drink I had was largely ice, both of which were quite disappointing. Staff can be a little rude and quite pushy in terms of getting you to order, even if the place is largely empty. 

It's location is amazing - just north of Bay and College, super convenient, so it might be worth a visit if you're in the area and are craving bubble tea or drinks in general, but nothing special about this Green Grotto location."}
{"text":"This restaurant is situated in a beautiful space, with huge windows and tall ceilings. At first glance, the menu appears to be a glossy magazine, filled with fancy pictures, bilingual descriptions, and countless headings and options (can someone explain to me what is, exactly, the difference between 'milk tea' and 'fresh milk tea?') Service was prompt and pleasant, and I enjoyed sitting up on the high table, which faces out onto Bay street. 

Unfortunately, the food didn't meet the expectations that the colourful menu promised. The dry noodles in sesame sauce with Taiwanese sausage was overall 'ok', but the mix of flavours didn't quite work: the sweet sausage, the slightly sour/spicy tofu and the salty sesame noodles clashed, competing for dominance, and the uninspired boiled soy egg was a sad afterthought. Perhaps it was a bad decision on my part when it came to choosing the flavouring (because, as many things on this menu, I had the confusing options of soy, sesame, satay etc. etc.) The deep fried mini octopus were well done and crispy, and my drink (sesame bubble tea) was fine. 

Perhaps refinement of a few menu items rather than offering a plethora of choices could be a step in the right direction."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today after driving pass it so many times before. I didn't realize it wasn't your typical bubble tea place with the menu displayed on digital screens, a good sit down place to study or hang out for a couple hours if you enjoy the quiet. It's nice and soothing with light music playing, cute decor and not crowded. They also have a shelf covering one wall with what I assume are books, magazines and board games? I only came to get a drink to go so I didn't take much of it in.

I ordered two drinks, the maccha affogato and the milk chocolate explosion which were both available in size Large only. About $13 for both drinks which is pretty affordable and average for size large at almost all bubble tea spots I've tried. Kind of sucks that they weren't available in the regular size because what if the drink wasn't good? Anyways, these two drinks were definitely different from the normal honey milk tea I get at any spot I go to. They had a lot of variety and I liked the green tea/coffee combo in the maccha affogato. When you mix the vanilla ice cream into the drink, you get this great sweet flavour throughout the drink. The only thing I could say that I didn't like as much was the tapioca because didn't have much flavour but I really liked that there were different types and sizes of it. I paid an extra 50 cents to add it into my drink.

On the other hand, the milk chocolate explosion is basically a chocolate slush and it was also very good. Not your normal drink you get at a bubble tea shop but like I said, not your typical tea shop when it comes to the classics but they do sell those if you are into it; oolong, green tea, grass jelly, red bean etc, you name it.

I will definitely come back to try out other drinks as well as the food they serve."}
{"text":"Service: 2/5
Food: 2/5


Met up with a couple of friends at Green Grotto around 9:30PM last night. We sat at our table for a good 20 minutes before someone came to take our orders. The Pistachio Chocolate Crunch Mousse Cake looked really appealing so I decided to go with that. I waited around 30 minutes and the cake was still a no-show so I flagged down the server to remind her. She gave me a blank look and returned with my cake after another 10 minutes. The dryness of the cake and its lack of flavor were major turn-offs. The server also forgot my friend's drink so the poor guy was waiting pointlessly for an hour."}
{"text":"Decent place. Much better places like cha me cha uptown, but this is the closest to me as I live in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Came here for some bubble tea with a friend after an exam. Went inside, got a seat but no one bothered to acknowledge or take our order. 20 minutes went by...still nothing. Made our way to the front for takeout and waited 10 mins...STILL NOTHING. We went to Chatime, which was literally down the street. 

Haven't been to any other Green Grotto's but I will definitely not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I came here with three of my other friends on a Wednesday night. The cafe was almost completely empty, with one group of girls studying and a group of guys playing board games. Turns out the group of guys worked at the cafe as well. 

I heard the hokkaido milk tea was good, so I decided to order it with tapioca at 25% sugar level. The tea flavor was very strong, which I liked, however the tapioca balls were a variety of small and large sizes. I found the large ones to be a bit too soft and the small ones odd to taste. I wish I had gotten the grass jelly! I definitely recommend that topping instead. 

Board games were available to us to play like any other cafe. The decor is so cute and it feels cozy to chill here. After we finished, I was surprised to see a $6.99 bill for a regular sized Hokkaido milk tea with tapioca. This price is pretty high and I don't think it was worth it for what I got."}
{"text":"Good place to just have a bubble tea and hang out for a while. 

Service is okay. Took almost 20 minutes since sitting before they took the actual order for the drinks. But not really much you can expect from a bbt place.

Washroom was not cleaned and there was no toilet paper. They just put a roll by the sink... This isn't the first time either. Everytime I've visited there's been an issue with the washroom area"}
{"text":"I've dined here three times (once just for drinks, other two times for early dinner) and have been here a few times to get takeout drinks.  I wouldn't say the food is amazing, but it's not terrible either.  A little bit on the expensive side, but I guess that's how it is for bubble tea snack places.  The first time I ate a meal here was for their beef noodle soup and the second time was their curry porklet rice.  Both were fine, nothing amazing.  I really like their Hokkaido milk tea, so I usually get that as takeout and as a dine-in drink.  I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to get food here, but if I'm around the area and want bubble tea, I'll stop by."}
{"text":"What would I do without Green Grotto? During the day it's great for working with ample seating and plugs, good natural light and just enough background noise. After 7pm (Friday to Sunday), it's a lively place with groups playing board games, uproarious laughter and the occasional couple on a date, although I don't know how they carry on above the din. 

The drinks are alright. They're of the blended powder/syrup/sugar/food colouring variety and you can half sweet this or no syrup that, but your drink still won't be healthy...or all that great. Unless you're a teenager then the drinks are UH-mazing! 

Come to work, stay for the outlets/wifi, order drinks to pay cover charge and don't be obnoxious or the staff will enforce their 3 hours sitting rule."}
{"text":"Location is not good , but the stuff is so nice . Bubble tea is good, we also bought tea with jelly . Taste so good. Take out 15%"}
{"text":"The interior design is nice and the service is okay. However the food was not so nice and over priced. I had two people telling me that this place does not have good food. And I guess I have to learn the lesson myself to figure it out. 
The matcha budding has this weird taste and I feel so bad I could not finished it.... because the waiter is so nice and I don't want him to see my full plate. The sticky rice is okay and the fried food is way too salty but mediocre.
A very good place to chat but really, the food is disappointing."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and it feels really relaxing.  It feels like you are in a bookstore because there are tons of magazines for the costumers to read. Most of the time, people bring their laptop or chit chat with their friends. The menu is like a magazine and there are a lot of yummy food and drinks I really want to try.
I have the white peach green tea and it tastes like there is milk instead and the favor is different and good.  I order the Oden - Japanese stew for snacks. I love the Japanese fish balls and the sauce is yummy. :-)

I am glad we are able to try this tea room."}
{"text":"Drove by this very cool looking place and decided to stop in for dinner. The decor is very modern and artsy yet casual.
The menu consists or teas, ramen bowls, rice bowls, snacks etc.
Unfortunately for me the server said we don't have anything gluten free but they do have veg options.
Their noodles are wheat based and they did not have rice noodles. I declined the rice as the curry was dairy based and I just can't eat plain rice.
I opted for the fried tofu and sweet potato fries. Both were mildly seasoned and they gave me a sweet chili dipping sauce as they only had soy sauce, not gf tamari.
For the starter on the table, instead of bread or edamame, they gave a bowl of popcorn. I liked this and thought it was kind of cool. Seeing the clientele was all young people (except us) I can see how it works.
My friend ordered the tomato ramen but did not like the pickled egg or veg ham in it.
Great looking place with nice staff but food is not appropriate for me, a gf vegan, to get a satisfying"}
{"text":"We use to love coming here for lunch and bbt. Unfortunately our recent visit was terrible and mainly due to the food. We have ordered the popcorn chicken with rice on several occassions. However, they have reduced the meat portion by half which is less than the snack size. For the meal it is $12 and snack is $7, so we asked the server if there was an error or if we should have ordered the chicken and rice separately because it would be cheaper and larger. She had no comment. I ordered the chicken cutlet curry rice which looked better but it came out cold. The drinks were good, we ordered the white peach oolong and strawberry twist yogurt. We asked to speak to a manager, they asked us to call the head office. The kitchen manager eventually came out and tried to make the situation better but we ended up finding another place for lunch. We were quite disappointed and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome place to sit down to have some bubble tea while catching up with friends. They open all the time, even during the holidays, but make sure you arrive early because the seats get filled up fast. 

3 hour seating limit with any purchase, plus free popcorns. There are lots of comfy seats and even couches available. There are some books and magazines on the shelves for customers to read. I think there are some boardgames too, but it is best that you bring your own. Also, the good part is that many wall seats are beside power outlets and they welcome customers to bring their laptops over, so it's also a great place for students to come work on school assignments. 

The menu has an extensive selection of drinks, including bubble tea, fruit tea, slushies, and hot tea. They also have some food items as well, such as Taiwan style small snacks, but they also have lunch and dinner combos available. The prices of the drinks are slightly more expensive, around $5-8, but then again you're also paying for hanging out at the cafe."}
{"text":"Wow this location is really lacking in business...

I have been to multiple Green Grotto locations, including at Steeles/Warden and Hwy7/Warden, this is by far the most empty Green Grotto store. There were literally no other customers dining at this place when we came at around 7:30pm on a Friday night, which was prime time dinner hour on a weekend. 

We enjoyed taking pictures of the decor while we were here, since there were no other customers around and the place was beautifully renovated. The decor reminded me of stepping into a fairytale land and it was really soothing to hang around. 

Unfortunately, I was really disappointed by its food when we eat ordered something for dinner. The prices and selections were about the same as other stores (same menu), but the portions and presentations felt sub-par. It didn't taste very good and it wasn't a great value given the price they charge and how little meats you get. Also, no free popcorns.

Would give it 1 star if it's just about the food, but the nice decors earn them the extra star."}
{"text":"Lovely Green Grotto, which finally opened downtown. The space is beautiful, very high ceilings however I wish there is more seating like an additional floor. It looks great though, their drinks and food are okay. I don't recall what drink I ordered but it was REALLY SWEET. I didn't end up finishing it. Decent spot to work out of downtown if especially if you're able to grab a booth."}
{"text":"The space itself is amazing. There's artwork suspending from wires above in a 2 storey high open ceiling. It's flooded with sunlight during the day because of the all glass enclosure.

The drinks are good, there's an extensive menu of drinks with occasional features/limited edition offerings. *Another reviewer mentioned fresh milk tea vs milk tea. Bubble tea is usually made with milk powder so fresh milk literally means milk like you buy in stores.

The food is hit or miss. I'd say you can't really go wrong with any of the fried snacks they offer. I once ordered deep fried soft shell crab with dry noodles. The crab was great, the noodles were definitely dry... too dry. Their chicken was fine and their rice with mince pork was okay as well. I wouldn't recommend a meal here.

Service is alright. The workers are usually able to understand and communicate just fine, I will say they sometimes confuse my order but they fix it promptly, no questions asked.

Also I wouldn't study here, there's a 2-hour seat allowance. I've never seen it enforced but it's probably better not to risk it."}
{"text":"Does this place get busy or what? Showed up Sunday afternoon at 3-4PM and all the tables were taken. Groups arriving after us had to wait. That's usually supposed to be quiet period for bubble tea places.

Oh well. There's a good variety of drinks, hot and cold, along with some basic dishes, snacks, and desserts. This place is good if you're coming for bubble tea or Taiwanese snacks/desserts, but don't bother with the cakes or anything else like that -- that's pretty much grocery store quality stuff.

Service is fine, pretty much the standard level at a bubble tea place, but kudos to them for actually accommodating groups that want to split the bill and pay with a credit card. The complimentary popcorn is also a terrific bonus."}
{"text":"The best-looking bubble tea shop I have ever seen, by far. Even if the bubble tea was mediocre, I'd come here just for the environment. Thankfully it isn't just mediocre, the tea actually tastes pretty good. It is of a different style/taste from what I've gotten used to from Chatime or CoCo, and you don't have all the customization that you may be accustomed to at those places, but it's still good. I find them to be a bit heavier on the flavour of the tea here. Service was fine, nothing special but it got the job done. I don't know if they'll manage to keep this place sustainable as I imagine the rent must be fairly high, but all the best to them!"}
{"text":"Tried the sugar cane milk with grass jelly $5.99 (take-out price is 15% off).

Tasted okay but I much prefer the standard black milk tea with grass jelly. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This location just opened recently. It's very close to the St. Joseph location, but I think it has a larger menu and it feels like it's more spacious as well.

Even though it's new, the staff seems to function like they've been around a while. E.g., we didn't have to sit a while and wait for people to come take our order. Food and drinks came at a resonable time. They stopped by frequently to check if we needed anything else, etc.

We only got snacks (soy fritters and fried tofu) and drinks, so I can't really comment too much about the food overall at this point. But the snacks were tasty! We were also very happy that they had a nice number of vegetarian items on their menu as well. 

There's free wifi here.
There's a 20% promo happening right now.
They also gave free popcorn to us as well.

Woohoo!"}
{"text":"This is the original green grotto in Toronto and they used to always be packed in their old location beside Keung's Delight. Now they've moved to a bigger location, replacing the Wendy's and it's still packed during the busy nights. I really hope they open the drive-thru one day and serve bbt drive through!

The service is slightly above par but the free popcorn (with refills) will keep you patient and satiated throughout your stay. If you don't like popcorn, there's acceptable taiwanese food for a good price to go with some amazing bbt.

The new menu is more of a magazine and is terrible at doing its job (of telling you what drinks you can order). However, I find that you can get pretty much any drink and it'll be good. Many times, the drinks are too sweet so I would suggest getting less sugar.

Highlights
Pros: great variety, free popcorn
Cons: always packed
My Summer Drink: White peach oolong/green tea with tapioca, no ice
My Winter Drink: hot original milk tea with tapioca"}
{"text":"The good: this bubble tea shop has been here for a while and with good reason. Even after the boom of chatime, I always would rank green grotto as one of my top go to bubble tea places. A great place to chill with friends, open late, huge selection in drinks, and have popcorn as a snack for free is always good.

The bad: wait times could be pretty bad, especially during the weekends.

The ugly: nothing too ugly to note here.

Neutral: great for groups, open late, good option if you and your friends have nothing else to do."}
{"text":"I come here all the time with my family and friends and it never disappoints. Sometimes during the weekend they are really busy but the wait isn't that long! Their cakes are also super popular and most of the good ones get sold out fast. Every time I come here I'll always order salt and pepper chicken and amaretto cheesecake. Free popcorn, free wifi, and service is pretty good."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better bubble tea/dessert lounges I've been to. They offer free popcorn at every table whenever you stay here. Ambience is quite nice and homey. They have a great collection of magazines for you to enjoy and feel free to show up with some board games too.

I ordered a lychee green tea and strawberry champagne cheese cake. The drink was a bit too sweet but I'm sure that's adjustable if you ask but other then that, flavour was on point. The cheese cake was delicious! The texture was soft in the right places and presentation was very pretty as well. Not too strong but it does tend to get too sweet if you have too much! Great place to hangout or get some work done in."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Green Grotto since it was at its old location but this new location is a vast improvement and they still give you free popcorn. Their drinks are good and their Taiwanese style fried chicken is really good; we ordered it because it seemed like every other table had a plate of it."}
{"text":"I had an amazing time! Ordered two drinks a cold drinks are great. The drinks are huge and I felt like definitely worth the $6 and they kept the free fresh popcorn coming! 

I liked that even when the place is packed the attentive staff can get the order fast and correct!

Will definitely return :)"}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here and while I didn't understand why the reviews weren't up to par with how beautiful the place, I figured soon after why.

INSIDE: with ceilings reaching probably 20 feet or more, they were able to include abstract art in great proportion (which is really what drew me in).

FOOD: it's like any other Taiwanese tea shops, there wasn't anything different in the menu. We had ordered something that they didn't have, uhm, then put a sold-out sign on the menu. 

DRINKS: Again, we tried to order something on the menu and was told this was not available at this time

While I'm okay with food or drinks running out, I'd like to know about them ahead of time - instead, I was given a menu and had to find the hard way that my friends and my choices weren't available.

FINAL THOUGHTS: I'll give it another try, hopefully I'll have a better experience then."}
{"text":"Green Grotto was actually the name of the first ever Taiwanese bubble tea place in Toronto, that's over 20 years ago on Yonge south of Sheppard.  I was excited to see this store back then, brought back a lot of Taiwan memories.  Not sure if the owner of this place is the same original two brothers.  Food is definitely Taiwan flavor, not the best I've had, but decent.  I guess they focus more on the selling of their tea then their meals.  I will probably not come back, not saying the food is bad, but there are 2 other Taiwanese restaurants that I pass by on my way here, and they are both better than this, so....

I give it a 6 out of 10."}
{"text":"This a beautiful shop and a good spot to spend some time just to relax, especially during off hours when it's not as busy. The drinks are generally good and not overly sweet. Their tapioca is on the soft side, borderline too mushy by the time you get to the end of it, so I'd recommend trying one of the other toppings. The crispy trio was pretty good, the popcorn chicken and fish ball in there was nice and flavorful. The fishcake fries were a bit bland. 

I would not recommend the mama beef noodles. It had a nice spice and the beef pieces were decent, but the soup is bland and the noodles were very heavy."}
{"text":"Came here again for dinner. Their  souls were  good,  and  the Panza was Great!   Flaky pastry it is,  without the  grease.   The  server this time needs to shed some attitude though."}
{"text":"The bubble tea was average, and the popcorn was decent. The place itself looked nice, and was a pretty good place to chill.

The menus are confusing as hell - I think they tried to be cute/clever and make it look like a fashion magazine, but it was just a convoluted mess. The staff are pretty disorganized. There was a glut of people sitting/standing in the waiting area while half the restaurant was empty... It took an abnormally long time and discussion for the staff to figure out where/how to seat everyone."}
{"text":"Actual rating: 3.5/5

I come here pretty often because I have business in the area, and Green Grotto is usually the place I go to do work. The music is pretty chill and a lot people come here to hang out or to get work done. 

I came with friends as a group of 5 and we got the comfy seats in the corner with couches. The waiters here are friendly and helpful.

I ordered a white peach green tea ($5.99) and sweet potato fries ($4.99). The drink was quite large and it was sweet with a slightly bitter aftertaste. I find that their green tea drinks are usually too sugary for me because I get very jittery after drinking them, but I'm usually okay with the taste. I liked the sweet potato fries, but the portion isn't very large for the price. My friend ordered the Taiwanese sausages. They're good, but we agreed that Sugar Marmalade makes them better.

We also wanted to order honey garlic chicken wings, but it turns out that they don't have it on the menu anymore; the menus they give you are old, so what you ask for might not be available. They should update their menus.

That notwithstanding, Green Grotto is consistent with their service and it's a nice place to go with friends or to do work if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Quality of food is ok but unfortunately they have extreme horrible customer service. No one greet you at the door but when they do, they look at you like you are a bunch of aliens! All of them have bad attitude. They all have a \" I don't give a damn\" look on their face! I would rather go to Papa Chang for the same type of food but way cheaper and much better service than this crappy place!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks kinda suck here. I ordered a pot
of tea for 6.99, which is along the same prices for other places for freshly brewed tea. The tea comes and there is no whole fruit inside the tea - it's just shredded pieces. I dont think this is worth even 2.50. Used to be amazing when it was a smaller restaurant. I dont remember liking any food i ordered here after it changed locations (gone maybe 3-4 times). Chat time or gong cha has better drinks and gofortea is my goto for food or drinks in terms of a bbt place. very busy and loud."}
{"text":"The ambience of this place is really great.  When you get inside,  the space opens up with super high ceilings.   Drinks are what you would find at any place.  Decor is really nice.  Great place to chill out.   The drinks are probably just ok.   But you don't come here for the bubble tea.  You come here to just chat with friends."}
{"text":"Free popcorn to start off. 

Nice bright ambience.  Choice of High table/chairs, regular height tables with regular or accent chairs. There are shelves of books and magazines and a few board games to borrow. 

My companion ordered Salt Pepper Chicken with rice which is basically popcorn chicken with some kimchi and string beans. 

I tried  New item in menu: Japanese BBQ Pork Dry Noodle with Egg.  The pork has sweet sauce on top, pork cooked tender, noodles cooked al dente, came with 2 pcs pork jerky, pickled cucumbers and crispy sesame seeds with seaweed.   It takes your palette to something sweet, something salty, something sour, with textures from soft, tender, chewy and crispy. 

Their lunch specials are $10.99, choice of curry or mapo tofu sauces to combine with either fish, chicken, porkchop or vegetarian squares and comes with regular size drink."}
{"text":"Bubble tea was not bad but the food was horrible. Don't ever order beef stew. It has so much fat in it and not much meat. It takes forever food to come out. If you ask me to go there again, WILL NOT GO BACK!!!!!!
Horrible service"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times when I've had to meet people from up north. Drinks and food are good and standard, like most of the bubble tea chains. 
The service though is insufferable. The servers stand around and don't seem to understand what they're supposed to do. They hide by the counter and look scared to engage the clients. You have to flag them down to take your order  and once they deliver your order, they won't return. Every time I wanted something, they seemed a little surprised. It's like you have to teach them what their job is."}
{"text":"Really cozy atmosphere and great drinks! I recommend the Hokkaido milk tea and the Okinawa with tapioca :) Their condensed milk toast is yummy too!"}
{"text":"I tried the fresh milk oolong tea here and asked for half sugar- the ratio of milk and tea is perfect and the it's not as sweet as other bbt places! I always go for 0 sugar in chatime and for green grotto half sugar is totally fine! 
The Markham location is better than the midland one. 
Tapioca here is well cooked and very chewy."}
{"text":"For reference, I have been here several times. Now, let's get on with my review...

For starters, where's my popcorn? All the other people were given a bowl/cup of popcorn. My friend and I were not given any. Strike one.

For food, we ordered the sweet potato fries and the chicken bits. The fries were decent. A little salty, but that's OK. The chicken bits, however, were nothing more than battered cartilage. Every single bite I took had a \"bit\" of cartilage in it. No wonder they're called \"bits\". It seems like we got the leftovers of the good stuff. Strike two.

Finally, the servers are not attentive. There are three people waving. No response. Strike three.

Aside from those things, I do like the atmosphere and the large space. It is a place where I can have a nice tea and study. The music isn't too loud or disruptive, so that's a plus.

This was just a bad day to visit Green Groto. Next time, I'll visit the Midland & McNicoll location. Maybe I'll have a better experience then."}
{"text":"Come here very often because it's pretty close to myself. Bubble tea here is average usually powdered tea for what I get and you don't really taste the tea but you do taste the sugar. The popcorn is often stale or over salted, and it shocks you sometimes how bad the popcorn is.

The service is pretty bad here as well, waitresses don't really care about you and they make it obvious. The staff is always chatting and sometimes it's hard to get a hold of them. It's still a good place to come with friends because it's a good environment to relax and get a drink."}
{"text":"This place was quiet, nice place to study and good for what's in the area. But they have straws with no plastic wrap and seems very unsanitary. The fridge looks kind of gross with the cakes inside. And the \"free\" drinks looked like the milk went bad."}
{"text":"I use to be so against going to green grotto ever since my bad experience at midland and mcnicoil. A friend of mine wanted to go study recently so he suggested to go to green grotto but instead try out the warden and steeles one. My experience here through customer service was already far better than the other green grotto I've been to before. Our server was super kind and attentive.

We ordered the Hokkaido milk tea with tapioca, popcorn chicken, and unagi rice. Their Hokkaido milk tea was delicious but overall their food is decent. There's nothing special about this place except that it's actually a very quiet atmosphere. We both stayed for about 2-3 hours and actually got a lot of work and studying done. Definitely my new study corner! 

They accept all sorts of payment."}
{"text":"I greatly enjoyed Green Grotto. As many fans before me have mentioned, the big windows and high ceilings make for an enjoyable setting. Even on a cloudy day, being able to look up and see into the distance makes for a great atmosphere while eating. The honey green milk tea is fabulous. Anything with honey here, really, is worth trying. I also like how the tapioca in the drinks here are more chewy than the Chatime or Coco variety, and was delighted to get the mixed tapioca option (both big and small tapioca in the drink). 

In terms of food, the takoyaki balls were delicious. I'm Taiwanese, so I had to try their braised pork (or pork belly!) on rice (haha that's how you tell if they do Taiwanese food well - by trying the one thing you can get in any Taiwanese restaurant - braised pork on rice!). I'd say it's a solid 4/5 for downtown Toronto. Extra points for coming fast. The egg that came with it though was dry and tough, and didn't add to the dish in my opinion.

I think some of the ratings on here are low because people are comparing this new Bay St. location to Green Grotto's previously-established locations uptown. However, as someone who has never visited the locations uptown, I have to say that the Bay St. Green Grotto is great. Solid Taiwanese food for solid prices in a very very convenient location. If you stick to drinks and appetizers/snacks, this is a great place to hang out with someone on a Saturday afternoon.

Giving it 5 stars because the high ceilings are seriously nice for a bubble tea joint."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and space for a bubbletea-focused place. There is also an extensive menu here for typical Taiwanses-style fare.

Tried the beef noodle soup here and thought the flavour was OK, but the beef brisket could be a little more tender. I also ordered the Matcha Hokkaido milk tea with grass jelly. There wasn't much matcha flavor and I found the price a bit expensive.

I like the fact that they give you popcorn while you wait for your order to keep you from being hangry.

Overall, it is an OK place, but I am not in a rush to come back"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for their beef noodle soup. 

This is probably the worst beef noodle soup I have ever had in my life! The beef was chewy and the flavour of the both was terrible! It tasted like they just threw in random spices and hoped for the best.  The noodles they use was also a bit different that what your average resto use. The best part of the dish was the pickled sour veggie they gave you on the side. 

The portion was abundance at the price of $9.99, but it was way more than what my tastebuds can tolerate. There was still 3/4 of the bowl left left when I call it quits."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times and it's always been consistent. Pros are good food and drinks and comfortable atmosphere. Cons (somewhat) are the subpar service. There are never enough wait staff so you need to actively wave them down. I guess I'm pretty forgiving because this is typical of many Asian food places. Plus, once you get their attention, the servers do the best that they can. For drinks, the jelly trio roasted milk tea (half sweet) is very good. Compared to cha time, the flavour is less roasted, but the trio jelly (three different types) is a nice combination. All of the herbal/fruit teas are always quite good, but nothing special. For food, I've only tried the braised and ground meat with rice and ramen. The rice dish was quite authentically Taiwanese. Quality and taste is better than ZenQ or ChaMeCha. The ramen was surprisingly good as well. HOWEVER, manage your expectations as I did. I did NOT get an authentic Japanese ramen, and that was totally my expectation. If you just want a nice bowl of noodle soup that has good flavour, not too spicy and substantial ingredients, this will hit the spot. I liked it for what it is. Green Grotto has multiple locations, but I've only been to this one. Apparently, this is one of the better locations. Given its history and experience, I can believe that."}
{"text":"A typical asian bubble tea cafe that I've been waiting to find one in downtown. Taiwanese comfort food, bubble tea and a place to hangout with friends. The location is not as lively as ones you find in uptown but still offers a nice food selection. No complain here."}
{"text":"It's a decent place to get bbt. Depending on the time and the server, service may vary. In general, its an economical place to chill with friends. The large drinks are quite generous and they are worth the upgrade."}
{"text":"I've been to their Warden/Steele location. This one is another one of their flagship restaurants. I got the Taiwan popcorn chicken rice set with hibiscus drink. The drink came after I finished my meal which isn't too good. The popcorn they gave for free is a bit burnt. 
The popcorn chicken set is nice, it came fresh and quickly. Just wished the drink came earlier as I was thirsty.
The decor is nice, their staff you can tell was new. They came by asking if I ordered after I ordered and when I asked for my drink, the server said he'll go check and never came back with answers.
Oh well, it's 20% off so can't complain."}
{"text":"This place is my kids' favourite because of free popcorn and free WIFI. 

It is a nice place for killing time- many Japanese and Taiwanese magazine to read and board games to play. There is a seating time limit for 2 hours. This place is getting busier after dinner time because it open late for people to hang around till late.

There are many choices of bubble tea and desserts to choose from. I always enjoy the Hokkaido Milk Tea. The hot meal is decent as well. I like their Taiwanese popcorn chicken and braised beef noodles soup. Lunch special has better value; dinner may end up be quite expensive to get a have a whole set with a dish and drink."}
{"text":"The place is nice to sit but their bathroom stinks! Ick. Bubble tea is alright, powder stuff and hot tea is served with syrup already added! Super sweet. Foos was just alright, eat if you're starving. Won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a great place for snacks and drinks. Been to this location several times now, keep in mind this is the new location located beside Boston Pizza. 

The overall interior design is very unique which gives off the feeling of being at home. Although noise level can get a bit on the louder side due to the place always being packed it keeps the restaurant from being awkwardly quiet. The menus feel and look like magazines instead of the typical laminated menus. The food and drinks are delish, the food more than the drinks. They offer a large selection of variety for their deserts. They also have WiFi which is great."}
{"text":"Beautiful space with high glass windows which really brightens up the place. Place seemed busy with booths and large communal tables. Came here for takeout drinks only (I don't like to eat at bubble tea places) so can only review takeout. Takeout orders are taken at the counter to the left. Service was a bit slow. We made the mistake of picking up our own drinks when we saw it was ready on the counter but you're supposed to wait for someone to verify it and hand it to you which made it even slower since the servers were quite busy. We got the charcoal tarp crepe cake as well which was quite creamy. The drinks were on par to other green grottos we visited. Honey lemon tea was nice and they were nice enough to add extra honey upon our request. Matcha red bean slush had whole pieces of red bean in it but not much of a matcha taste. Would probably try something else next time. Overall convenient location downtown but with limited parking, wouldn't stick around. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Nice place to just grab a light snack, dessert or drink and catch up with your friends while you're at it!"}
{"text":"GO TO ANOTHER LOCATION OR CHATIME JUST UP THE STREET FOR BETTER QUALITY DRINKS AND SERVICE! I am a regular customer here and I can honestly say tonight I am VERY disappointed in the service I received here (may 26, 2015) and that I will NOT BE COMING BACK! These people only care about making money and do not care about service or quality. They speak to you in a condescending manner and pretty much told us to leave if we are unhappy and to go Starbucks right around the corner. 

First of all, this is usually a pretty decent studying spot. But when it's peak hours they really don't care. I came with a friend and they tried to seat us at a single table and we asked for a bigger table. They accommodated but after came back and was persistent in making us squeeze into one single table. And pretty much said if your studying books and laptop don't fit. It's your problem. If I came alone they would seat me at a single table. I have two people why can't you treat us as two separate people who came. They claim they need to accommodate their guests but we are your guests too whom you're not accommodating to. 

Secondly, green grotto (all locations) is usually pretty good with switching your drinks for free when there is something wrong with it. But tonight the SAME GUY pretty much told my friend it's her problem she doesn't like the drink but they will not do anything about it. Offered to dilute it with water...? And suggested we go to Starbucks instead. 

I felt so disrespected as I was spoken to in such a demeaning manner and heavy attitude."}
{"text":"I've come here many times with friends both Asian and non Asian. 

Decor is bright and warming environment. 

The drinks are high quality. This is the spot when you want to chat with your friends for a long time and only this tea place gives you the feeling where you don't want to leave!

Service: Very satisfied with service here, they treat you very well even when your friends act like idiots :)."}
{"text":"Two Green Grotto right across from each other and seems both doing a good business.

This new Green Grotto took over where Wendy's used to be! The space had completely transformed and the only thing left maybe the defunctional drive thru.

The friendly staff even remind my pregnant friend not to have any cold drink especially with herbal jello!

The menu is identical to other Green Grotto's location but with more seating and more spacious.

Parking can be a pain but not impossible to find a spot.

Free wifi and popcorn."}
{"text":"Came here for bubble tea a few days ago. I always end up getting the mango slush w/ tapioca so this time I decided to go for the honeydew milk tea w/ tapioca and it was good!

3 stars because the tapioca came in different sizes (e.g. some were small, and some were huge) which made it hard to drink. The service was pretty slow, we literally had to raise our hand to get attention (however, the staff were kind). Also, the chairs were so uncomfortable! We had to slouch while sitting on them."}
{"text":"Nice place To chill around, play games and chat. Everything on the menu looks so delicious, cant wait To try more!"}
{"text":"Nice decor setup and the drinks were made perfectly. Staff were friendly and quick. One of my goto places now.

Bonus points for free freshly made popcorn!"}
{"text":"Great service, great staff, great prices, and great quality food and drinks. If you are in the area and want a refreshing drink with good food, Green Grotto Tea Room is the place to visit."}
{"text":"Food is not that great and the service is ok. The only good thing is that if you were craving asian food you dont have to drive all the way to yonge and finch to get it"}
{"text":"I generally think that Green Grotto is overpriced, but I do understand that I'm paying for a place to stay and service. What irks me is that every person must purchase something as a rule. I'm not encouraging a group of people to buy one item just to use up space, but the fact that every person is required to buy an item is such a money grab. Hey, it works though, and that's the point, right? 

The tables at this location are very close together, so it can get pretty cramped, especially in the winter when everyone has such heavy coats. Drink wise they have a large variety and everything is pretty good, but I would say it was especially superior to a place like Chatime or something. Some pros to this place are that you do have a server running around and there is free popcorn provided (but I can't eat popcorn, so that's not much of a perk to me). Employees are generally friendly, and I have never had any problems with them. 

I rate this place a solid three for wide selection and good service."}
{"text":"Green Grotto how I love you so!  I never get to come here given that I live in the USA but I've been craving this summer treat since our summer visit last year!  And when we come we roll 10 cousins deep and everyone gets their choice!  Coconut slush with lychee jelly is heavenly!  Not too sweet not too plain, just delightful!  My cousins got the pudding milk tea, interesting concept!

I haven't had a chance to sit down at any of the locations but I could see how this would be a cool place to hangout especially with their other snacks and meals.  Till next summer Green Grotto!"}
{"text":"TIP#1: GET THE GREEN GROTTO APP. It's an automatic BOGO drink free!

Overall, their drinks are decent, but their artsy decoration & huge windows are AWESOME.
Original Okinawa Tea - wasn't anything special
Chocolate Explosion - I was drawn in by the Ferrero Rocher, and although it tasted nice, it wasn't as decadent or rich as I thought it would be. It was more of a subtle chocolate flavour. I highly recommend adding small tapioca for a nice added texture, it's flavourful & has a firmer chew.
Taro (with real chunks) - small and VERY SWEET taro chunks, the drink is also very sweet so I would suggest getting 50% sweetness! I could only taste a trace of the taro flavour, otherwise it was mostly just a sweet milk tea flavour."}
{"text":": Green Grotto
: Fish Cakes Fries
: Green Grotto is my usual study spot, I always get a drink and popcorn chicken. I decided to try something new and I was so disappointed :(
: I was attracted by the presentation of the food. When I tried it, it tastes like cheap processed fish cakes. It was also very try.  Green Grotto does not offer any sauce aside from hot sauce which was a disappointment:(

: 0/10 Do not recommend"}
{"text":"Came here for some cold drinks and dessert. We ordered a crême brulée, white peach slush and a fresh milk ice matcha. Both drinks tasted very watered down. And for 6-7 bucks each, thats not good at all. Cake was good but can't really mess up on cake"}
{"text":"This place is really pretty for a bubble tea place in the area we went there to try it. The food was soo disappointed it did not taste fresh more of a microwave food. The bubble tea; we all had different kind of milk tea and even that did not taste fresh. This place is overpriced for food and bubble tea. The quality of food and drinks should really improve it's not worth it at all. Service was bad we ordered food at least give us some napkins and water...."}
{"text":"My friend and i decided to go to Green Grotto to work on our project because it has free wifi.  We were there for quite a few hours.   We had a hard time choosing drinks because there were so many to choose from, and all the pictures made them looked so delicious.  I finally decided on a grass jelly iced tea which tasted really good.  After we were given our drinks, no one came to check on us.  Hours after i had already finished my drink, i had to flag a waiter over to get a glass of water.  He looked rather unfriendly which was unfortunate... because he would have looked so much more handsome had he smiled, even if it's just slightly.
We also ordered dinner.  I ordered the beef ramen, which came in a large bowl which was good because i was hungry.  It was a little bit salty but flavourful.  
At the end of the night, a waitress came around and offered free popcorn.  She was warm and friendly.  If only all the wait staff were as nice as her!!!!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous interior decoration.   Unfortunately this impeccable style and presentation were not extended toward the food.  The rice noodles that i ordered came out in a plate looking like .... slop.  Is that even a word?!  And it tasted burnt.  Meh."}
{"text":"Oct 5 at 7pm. Noticed that the old staff I am used to isn't around. Music is obscenely loud today and the waitress isn't very responsive. Thankfully the waiter is still relatively okay. 

So today would be a remarkably lower rating considering that this is my favourite Green Grotto. Hopefully it doesn't degenerate further. Otherwise I would be going to Gong Cha for my tea cravings. 

Speaking of which 10 minutes in I still haven't gotten someone to take my order. I think I am in the waitress' serving area. Thankfully the waiter is a bit more responsive to my needs and took my order just as I was typing this paragraph. 

The male bathroom up until now still has a very offensive smell as if the sewer back flow was not installed correctly. 

Oh it seems one of the old staff is around. Mayhap he is working in the back.  At least he helped supplement the service when my friends arrived.

However the two star rating shall stay for now."}
{"text":"The Asian desserts like tea jelly and the one with beans in a bowl are excellent. The tea selection is unreal (ie great!) and the venue itself with super high ceilings and the decor is great. Bonus wifi! Just don't come for the food. It's oookkkk like barely edible but like I'll eat it when in a pinch or feeling desperate."}
{"text":"Always pass by this place, decided to finally give it a try tonight. 

We walked in and were immediately seated. Took the waiter 20 mins to come back for the drink orders. Apple green tea was really good, not sweet at all like most BBT places. 

However when it came time to order food, we ordered sesame chicken and Taiwanese fried noodle. They had neither. Why have it on your menu then? 

2 stars for the nice decor and good green tea. Passable.

Oh... And their \"free\" popcorn machine is broken."}
{"text":"My friends have been raving about this new place so I finally decided to give it a try. Walking in, we were greeted and asked if we wanted take out or to dine in. We dined in and chose seats near the wall. We were given menus and the server went away to give us time. From their vast selection of items, I ordered the Jelly trio passionfruit tea for $5.99. It took about 3 to 5 minutes to make which is reasonable for bbt. My friend got a tiramisu cheesecake and okinawa milk tea. She really enjoyed her drink, and also gave me a sample of the cheesecake. If you're a fan of cheesecake, I would recommend it. It had more cheesecake flavour than tiramisu...cheesecake flavour completely overpowered the tiramisu in my opinion. My drink was too bitter for my liking, but I accepted that as just part of the drink. I'll grab something sweeter for next time. Inside the cafe are some foosball tables, and a few books along the wall on your way to the bathroom (which is pretty big and accessible). Their inside has beautifully painted murals. It gave off a very whimsical vibe. I sat down with my friend for a good 2 or 3 hours. The only huge flaw is that they gave us our food and drinks without any napkins. Overall, it's a very nice place to sit in the afternoon to enjoy other people's company. You pay at the end of your stay for those dining in. I can see Grotto becomming the main pull to this plaza. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had their afternoon weekday special which included a Taiwanese rice dish and also a iced tea. It was actually quite a steal of around $10 and you do get a good lunch with tea included. I added lychee to my tea, which was very refreshing, and the rice dish that I ordered included a popcorn chicken, which is a staple of Taiwanese food. Definitely standard Taiwanese fare and very tasty, which went well with an iced drink. The seating is plenty and it wasn't too busy at the tea room. They also give you free popcorn which is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"All male staff at 2pm on Thursday. Raining alot outside. Still manages to ignore me and 3 tables ordering... T.T took them someone to yell excuse me really loudly to respond... Poor service compared to before. Food quality is ok for a tea place. It's nice and somewhat quiet environment."}
{"text":"Really nice staff, good variety of board games available to play, and nice atmosphere! But in terms of their bubble tea, I think they need some improvement. I had grass jelly as a topping one time I was there, and tapioca the other two. The grass jelly had clumps of starchiness.. I don't know if it wasn't made properly or if it went bad but I could feel the grains in my mouth. The tapioca didn't taste fresh. They were bloated/over-cooked so they weren't chewy. Also I'm used to tapioca that has a bit of sweetness to it, so this green grotto's tapioca tasted plain to me. I'm glad they opened a bubble tea place close to where I live so I will continue coming here nonetheless. I just hope they can improve on their bubble tea :)
_______________

May 6 edit - dropping it to 2/5 from 3/5. Their tapioca in bbt is consistently clumpy, bloated, and tasteless and the food dishes overpriced and bad.. we had a bowl of sugarcane fresh milk grass jelly is was goopy, clumpy and disgusting. All the food we had there so far seem microwaved and not fresh. Also I don't like how their complimentary popcorn is there some days and same days not.. even though I live walking distance I steer clear"}
