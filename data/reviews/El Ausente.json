{"text":"This place is on desolate area on Fremont. Don't be fooled. Best Mexican food I had. I ate mixed fajitas with chicken, steak and shrimp. My counterpart had carne asada wet burrito. Huge portions. Freshly made. Forget having self control when it comes to chips , guacamole and salsa. After all, the food was delicious."}

{"text":"El menudo was delicious! The young lady that waited on us was very attentive. This was my first time here but I will definitely return even if I have to make a 35 min drive. The long drive from home is long but it is worth it. The place is very clean and it has a family feel to it."}
{"text":"Fellow yelpers this is authentic mexican! Don't let the area or parking lot scare you!  
Food was delicious and reasonably priced. Huevos rancheros yummmm and the verde chiliquilles were flavorful."}

{"text":"The food is excellent, very friendly atmosphere, I have been eating here for over two years (atleast once every two weeks for lunch) along with many of my friends and never have any of us left hungry or not satisfied with our meal. Prices and very reasonable! This is truely a hidden gem in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great spot. Super affordable and tasty lunch specials. I had the carne asade chimi and it was way good. Great chips and salsa too."}
{"text":"What a great authentic Mexican restaurant! The garlic shrimp and the chicken and beef fajitas were so  yummy good.  Victor the owner was super nice and cordial our waitress  Norma was also. great. This place is at the top of our short list for authentic Mexican food ."}
{"text":"We went yesterday for the second time. Great again! I am not sure why this place isn't more crowded, the owner is always friendly, the female server (I have to ask her name!) is great and the food is exceptional.
I hear the shrimp is good, but I always get the carne asada burrito. It's big, full of flavor, and hard to beat. My friend got the Carne asada enchiladas. I had a taste and YUMMY! I might get them next time. I'd like to see  carnitas on their menu, but it's ok that they aren't as that would just be another temptation.
I would say you should go and try it. you WILL return."}
{"text":"Don't be afraid of the outside of this place. The food is delicious. If you want authentic Mexican food this is the place. Beers are $3 and the food is reasonably priced. The restrooms are clean. We were here with a party of 20 and the owner and waitress were more than accommodating."}
{"text":"Always friendly and fast. My favorite downtown Mexican joint. Area is terrible, but worth stopping if your in the area. I like the menudo and ceviche here."}
{"text":"Food is authentic and super tasty!! 

I enjoyed the fish tacos, along with carne asada. My mother's Garlic shrimp was superb!! Tenderly plump, perfectly prepared, juicy, and flavorful. :)

Restaurant is  clean, and close to home, happy i found this lil Mexican restaurant.. I'll be back!! Must try octopus tostado!"}
{"text":"The outside looks super sketchy but it's nice on the inside. Came here with my boyfriend and the food is fantastic. I had the carne asada dinner plate my bf had the chicken burrito both were amazing. The meat was tender and had flavor. The staff was friendly as well. The only thing I can complain about is the service was a bit slow, didn't get a refill on water until we were almost done with our food. Otherwise great place."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas! The shrimp and fish tacos are TO DIE for and the micheladas are the BEST! Very authentic and delish"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican found the place when looking for a car now it's my favourite Mexican in Las Vegas recommend highly. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"This place was hard to find, but boy was it a great find! Its a hole in the wall type of place (which tend to be my favorites) and the food was fresh and outstanding :-D We ordered a shrimp plate to share, we could have easily fed a third person. I can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"I goto this restaurant at least once a month and always get good food. I recommend trying their food."}
{"text":"Great home cooked style food, an authentic Mexican restaurant. Try the ceviche tostada for starters, but really, you can't go wrong with most dishes. Do yourself a favor and try this place."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! So clean inside (including the restrooms) the chavela's are delicious and all the food we ordered was flavored to perfection.."}
{"text":"I live in the NW side of town and had been wanting to try this place for a while and we finally did!! We ordered shrimp tostadas, shrimp cocktails and fish and shrimp tacos.  The food was amazing and the service was great!!  This is the place to go for authentic Mexican food.  It was well worth the drive and I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but on the inside it has a cute diner feel to it. The staff is pleasant. They have 2 TVs on opposite sides of the room tuned to the same Spanish show. They also have a jukebox and occasionally play music. They have a nice variety of meals to choose from including meals designed for 2.
  They have horchatas (no refills- waitress gave me a look when I asked for no ice- I hate paying for a glass half full of ice), which in my opinion every Mexican restaurant should offer- I love cinnamon  :)  They also have some really big margaritas. Bf loves the different types of salted rims they have- he gets Modelo with a spicy rimmed glass.
  This was our second time. Both times he ordered green chilaquiles, and he says they're good, score 8/10. Last time I ordered the chicken burrito- very good. This time I tried to order chicken tamales, but all they had was pork. So I got the chicken enchiladas plate. I usually like enchiladas, but I don't usually rhapsodize about them. However, these were so good that I actually cleaned my plate! I can't remember the last time I ate the entire portion a restaurant gave me, and I wasn't starving, but these were really good 
  Looking forward to our next trip. Thanks El Ausente  :)"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Authentic flavors. You have to try the Ceviche. And the asada Tacos. I love the spiciness. The outside might not look good but the inside is clean and comfortable. Recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"BEST Mexican in Vegas. Tasty food, amazing service, and super clean. Worth the drive over!"}
{"text":"Stopped in before our flight back to NYC. This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's comfortable and clean inside.  

Now, onto the important stuff: the food. 

The salsa that accompanies the chips is fresh and flavorful. I ordered the shredded beef enchiladas. They were stuffed! The rice and beans were tasty too! I polished off the plate in about 5 minutes. 

This isn't a fancy spot. This is a place where you come with friends/family members to escape the strip and have some really good, authentic Mexican food. Everything tastes homemade and fresh! 

Great food and greater value!"}
{"text":"We moved to vegas from el paso a few years ago. Love the food, love the salsa. Highly authentic and absolutely delicious. Personally, I usually get the chile rellenos while my wife gets the enchiladas. Lunch price is even better."}
{"text":"Terrible and earie experience. Friday night about 8 I walk in..was asked to sit down anywhere, it was pretty much empty. But before I came in I could see a man in the dark dressed in black with a gun holster and then I saw a gun? Well turned out it was a security officer? Weird, and not good. Then what I ordered is easily pretty delicious anywhere in Vegas, a chicken quesadilla? But from the first bite I could taste an old greese taste..OK yukk! I was so hungry from driving around looking for where to eat..Then half way thru the meal, I had to pick the large clumps of chicken out on top of that it had almost no cheese? ..It was torturous! Then I gladly left finally..and all I could smell was from the smoke emitting from the kitchen were of the permiating old greese on the way to.my car! Ohh..never again! The waitress was pretty nice. I feel sorry for her working in that smelly place, and serving that food!!!"}
{"text":"I am sad for the reviewer that recently had a bad experience here. Maybe it was right before closing (not an excuse) or just bad luck. I have eaten here dozens of times and never had anything that was not outstanding.

Absolutely the best cheese enchiladas in Las Vegas! I grew up in South Texas where the cheese enchilada is King, so I know how they are supposed to taste."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here after tiring of the high-priced \"haute cuisine\" of the Strip -- it was excellent. We have very high standards for Mexican -- after spending time there and living in the Southwest. The Chile Verde was just right and the verde sauce fresh and excellent. Corn tortillas fresh off the press. Chicken/cheese enchiladas maybe a bit too cheesy, but delicious. Even the rice and beans were outstanding. Hubby started with ceviche pulpo and it was fresh and tasty. The atmosphere is indicative of the location and authenticity -- simple, but clean and the service very friendly. Next time we visit LV, we'll be stopping by."}
