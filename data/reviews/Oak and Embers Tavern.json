{"text":"Always a great time at this restaurant. Some of the best workers and food in this town. The bartenders, Dana and Jordan are amazing bartenders and provide the best service! 
Love Love Love going here. I highly recommend the food and the atmosphere helps as well."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a local radio celebrity  and another friend.Boy are we happy we tried it.Located in a newer L shape  strip mall.Nothing special in decor but  we came for the food not the decor.Brown paper table clothes should fore warn you this might get messy.While I didn't wear it like I  usually do I certainly could have.Several napkin saved the night.We ordered the Burnt Ends appetizer labeled as \"small plate\".Now to my hubby's  delight they came several boneless chard tips covered in a perfect BBQ sauce and accompanied by unusual fried plantain (banana cousin).I  was not going to try them as I  don't eat anything advertised as \"Burnt\".They smelled so good I  relented and am happy I  did.  Extremely tender and not quite burnt.could cut them with a spoon.Tasted wonderful.Will definitely  order again.For my entree I asked my waitress for her help.I asked her to pick between Cajun Shrimp and Cheesy Grits and a traditional BBQ platter.Since she is from the South she picked the Shrimp and Grits.OMG am I  glad she did.It came with extra large shrimp covered in a fantastic Cajun sauce atop great cheesy grits.Cajun sauce flavorful with a small bite.So much food I  could only eat 1/3 of it and took the rest home.I would be hard pressed to find any dish this good outside of Savanna. My hubby took a chance on one of the specials offered that night.Mako Shark or BBQ Beef Rib.He chose the beef.A large beef rib with perfectly  cooked finger carrots and a real twice baked potato. I sampled his carrots and could have had only that.grilled to perfection and tender.He said the beef was extremely  tender and very tasty.potato was a pleasant surprise.Great accompaniment to the beef and carrots.We will definitely  be back and hope to get the same waitress.She was very efficient yet not smothering.Dinner for two including Sweet Tea drinks and appetizer was $41.All in all a return trip is on our list."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other night for my brother in laws 40th birthday. There was about 20 of us and I completely understand we were a large party but there were 2 servers waiting on us. I waited almost 15 minutes for a pop after everyone else had their drinks. I also ordered a shot for the birthday boy and that also took about 10 minutes to get. After we ordered our food it took quite a bit of time to come out as well. Half our party got their food and almost all finished by the time the other half finally got theirs. When we asked the server about it we were told because there were 2 servers the orders went in at different times. The last two people to get their meals were the birthday boy and his wife. To me this is unacceptable, if the food would have been worth the wait it wouldn't have been so bad but the food was sub par at best.  Didn't even ask if we wanted desserts just brought us our checks."}
{"text":"I rated this is 3 because I had a little bit of a bad experience, here is what happened I have never been to a restaurant where the server was unable to remove an item not wanted AND UNEATEN from a bill this signature dessert that comes in a glass mug that I did not know was in a glass mug; its cake, moose, whipped cream, and ice cream( bourbon ice cream) that I would have more that likely enjoyed served on a plate or large bowl so, I could enjoy a little bite of all the flavors not all smashed together. THE MANAGER OR OWNER NOT SURE WHO DID TAKE IT OFF AFTER I AKSED TO SPEAK WITH THEM. I  think I just expected better from a bar, tavern, or restaurant that has been  featured on the FOOD NETWORK, LOCAL CLEVELAND TV SHOWCASE AND A HOST OF OTHER MEDIA OUTLETS.  NOW to the good stuff, the waitresses and host staff were nice and pleasant, the atmosphere is very comfortable and they have absolutely an above-average bourbon & cocktail selection and a lot of different beers on tap. The prices were good ,the food was pretty good as well. They do have a very alternative selection  of side dishes such as grits and white cheddar cheese that's not a normal restaurant side, that's not a normal bar side that were delicious. The mens restroom was clean and odor free YEAH! The menu is a little different than what's online and as you expect they do have some seasonal items. I will go back to this place again needless to say I will order a different dessert!!!  On my next trip there I will try the fish tacos, dirty grits,sweet potato fries, and for dessert the cheesecake. If this time blows me away I will edit this or re-review. OH10"}
{"text":"Food was mostly good, but brisket was tough and dry. Ribs were very good, as were all the sides. This would've been a 4 star review, but the service was abysmal. It took almost an hour to get our food and the waiter never checked back with us during that time. The good food isn't worth the lousy service, so I'd never go back."}
{"text":"Pulled pork was very good. Restaurant was a little too dark for the middle of the afternoon."}
{"text":"Met up with some friends for dinner at Oak & Embers tonight, which happened to be my first time here.  I'm originally from the south, so I've been in search for a good barbecue restaurant since moving to Ohio.

The Service:  I thought the service was decent.  The waitress waited on us promptly.  The drinks were brought out quickly, and the food came out soon after.  The was especially impressive to me since the joint was slammed with customers.

The Food:  I ordered the pulled pork dinner with a side of 4-cheese Mac, and a side of baked beans.  As a drink, I chose sweet tea.  The tea wasn't very sweet for this southerner, so I had to add a packet of sugar to get it right.  The pulled pork was pretty tasty, and there was plenty of it.  The sauce that came with it was a bit tangy, and forgettable to me.  Sonny's barbecue down south has a sweet sauce that is far superior to this one, but it was okay.  The macaroni and cheese was bland, so I wouldn't recommend that as a side.  The baked beans were decent, but didn't have a wow factor to it.  All in all, the meal was good, not great.  That's the main reason I'm giving 3 stars.....It was \"A-OK.\"

Ambiance:  It's kind of a cramped restaurant that is fairly noisy, but manageable.  The lighting seemed to be pretty good, which is important to me.  It wasn't too bright or dim.  Another reviewer said that this place has an identity crisis inside, and I can see their point.  Nothing to write home about.  

Overall, it was a decent visit.  The food was good, but not great.  The atmosphere was good, but again, not great.  The one plus for us was the service.  It was very quick,and professional.  Would I visit again?  Probably."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, great drink selection. Our server was friendly and stopped by often enough to keep our drinks filled.  Only downside was that it took a long time for empty glasses and plates to be removed. I don't know if someone else was supposed to bus tables, it was a very busy night too. Friends who ordered dessert weren't impressed though I didn't have room to try one myself!"}
{"text":"Had a family party planned and party room reserved. Planned over a month in advance by the way. We walked in and the lights were off and tables not set. I booked this party at a restaurant to save me some work. If I would have known better I should have just done it myself. Apparently they were short staffed... Not my problem. We had 25 people plus kids. This is a lot for one server. I felt bad for her.   The lack of concern or care from the management was off putting and disappointing. For the $700 bill I paid I should have not been stressed out and I am extremely disappointed. The food was good for the most part and my corn bread was dry. Won't be back and will not recommend. I guess your experience would be different if you are one off the local celebrities that endorse this place."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on inauguration day to watch the new president be sworn in. I walked into the restaurant and was shocked to see that the inauguration wasn't on any of the TV's. I asked a girl working there why the inauguration wasn't on any of the Tv's, she very rudely told me something along the lines of \"the owners hate Trump and we refuse to put him on the TV\". I asked if i could put on the inauguration and was bluntly told \"no\". Regardless of your political views, this is not how a customer should be treated."}
{"text":"One of the Best BBQs I have had - and I have had great Q in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Texas.  When my dinner arrived I thought I would be taking half of it home, but I couldn't stop eating the pulled pork.  So very good.  And the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Was not disappointed in this place.  We tried the porkgrinds with their chorizo/queso which was delicious. For dinner i got the chorizo meatloaf which was awesome.  My girlfriend got the filet which was great as well.  Service was really great.  Was definatley worth the 50 minute drive."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but I found this place not to deliver the value of food we paid for. My wife and I ordered the burnt ends, however they came with sauce poured all over them ruining the flavor of the meat. I got the brisket, which was completely covered in sauce and it over whelmed the flavor and taste of the meat. When I think of  barbecue, I believe that sauce ruins good meat if it is cooked and seasoned right. I can see having sauce on the table but to completely cover all of the dishes in sauce completely ruined my meal. I would not recommend this place to anyone who loves true traditional barbecue. I will not be going back. 

Also it was a Saturday afternoon and this place was dead only a handful of customers in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Found this place from a Michael Simon show on the Food Network and it did not disappoint. It is a bar atmosphere with superb BBQ!!! They had an excellent beer selection as well. The place was backed when we arrived, and we only had a short wait to be seated. The food arrived not long after ordering. I strongly recommend the BURNT ENDS to either share with your party before or you could even order as a meal, they were unique and phenomenal!! The owner, Mark stopped by our table to make sure everything was up-to-par. This is a great place to take friends and family - I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Barbeque is a religion.  However you may worship -- sauce, rub, smoke, charcoal, Memphis, Carolina, Kansas City, Texas, pork, beef, or other denomination --  eventually you find a shrine, the holy of holies, where you may easily want to spend eternity.  Some of us find it relatively soon while others continue an endless quest for something more fulfilling.  I found mine in Driftwood, Texas at the Salt Lick about 10 years ago.  But I live in Cleveland now and a sojourn to the Lone Star State is not always possible.    Gratefully, I have received divine guidance from Michael Symon on his new Food Network show, 'Burgers, Brews and Que'  when he visited 'Oak and Embers Tavern' in Chesterland, Ohio, roughly 30 miles from Cleveland.   
Symon's show introduced me to Marc and Gretchen Garofoli, whose concept tavern features some great que, brews, and a bourbon listing that is unparalleled for a smokehouse restaurant.  
We had to try the selections that Symon sampled - a smoked meatloaf, burnt brisket ends, and the pulled pork.  Very well on target.  The meatloaf was moist, and the smoke flavor heavenly.  It's topped with cheddar and onion straws.  I opted for their mac and cheese as the side.  Good and cheesy while not being goopy.  I still like mine a bit drier and broiled for a bit.  But it was better than anything else I have sampled in the region.  The meatloaf didn't appear to be drenched with barbeque sauce so I ordered a bit on the side.  Not sure it was there best batch.  Supposed to have a bourbon signature but I didn't get it.  The Carolina sauce, on the other hand, is mustard base and medium sweet.  It registered better with me.  
My dining companion opted for the pulled pork sandwich with smashed cheddar potatoes.  Again, a marvelous meat preparation that was juicy and flavorful.  The potatoes no so much.  Perhaps a sharper cheese would shine through.  Good but nothing exceptional.  There are a number of other side dishes on the menu so we will try some of the others on the next trip.  Have to mention the chow chow served with the sandwich which was the best I have ever tasted, chunky and more than just ground up pepper relish.
I spoke with Marc for a few moments.  He was gracious, friendly, and informative - the sort of individual you can't help but cheer on when you learn his story.  I was especially impressed with his devotion to scratch cooking.  Everything is done by hand.  This was evident in the preparation.   He was receptive to my opinions and I assured him that him that his place might be a different church but we found the right pew."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary dinner and used Yelp to make the reservation (SIMPLE). They seated is quickly and loved the atmosphere. We had some drinks and a flight of bourbon to taste and it was great and our waitress made a great recommendation. Had the pork rine  dip and it was pretty good. My wife and I both had the picks two and both of us were very happy with the tenderness of the chicken and ribs and flavor. Side dishes and corn bread were very very good. Cheesy mash potato were ridiculously good per my wife. I could have eaten more of the dirty grits !!!!!! Mac and cheese was good but didn't blow me away. The best part was the dessert cheese cake. Everything including the sides are made from scratch and you can tell. The cheesecake was from another world!!! My wife and I both think it was the best we have had.  Cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Food is excellent and the service is too.
Went for Easter brunch and the omelet bar was the winner for me. Everything done perfectly!."}
{"text":"Had a few people tell me it was really great BBQ so went with hubby and two other couples for a motorcylce ride and casual dinner.  Food was just OK.  Burnt Ends app was probably the  best we thing we had.  My salmon was overcooked but green beans were good.  Meatloaf was dry but mashed potatoes weren't bad.  Pulled pork sandwich was average. BBQ is very sweet, no really bad but we've all had better.  Service was OK."}
{"text":"I'm in town visiting my mom and we came here for lunch. Excellent food! My kids had the BBQ bacon cheeseburgers and could only eat half. The portions are huge. Freshly made fries too. I had the pulled pork platter. Amazing flavor and very tender. Sauce was good-not too spicy or sweet. Mac n cheese was creamy and homemade. Loved the fresh green beans and tomatoes too. The atmosphere and service is great too. We will be back."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants in the Cleveland area. Both service and food were phenomenal. We made a reservation in advance and were seated right away. I highly recommend the pulled pork, dirty grits, and smashed potatoes."}
{"text":"The smoked meats here are delicious, best in the area. My favorite are the smoked wings, very meaty. The sides are another reason we come back, best cheesy grits and succotash. I also love the Chicken and maple cornbread waffles. The cornbread waffles make it unique, and salty sweet."}
{"text":"awesome barbecue!!! I went to a few other joints on mentor ave  that I wont name and they sucked!!! this place is great! pulled pork is the bomb! drinks and not over priced. nice ride and if your lucky you will see Toni Rizzo there from fox 8. he was dating the owners sister."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and atmosphere! We try something different every time and love it all!"}
{"text":"2nd time back was well worth it.  The ribs, BBQ chicken and the pulled pork were exceptional.  Ordered 3 sides, regular fries, sweet potato fries, mac and cheese and the baked beans.  Ribs were tender and fell right off the bone with just the right amount of sauce and smokey flavor.  The biggest surprise was the baked beans.  Traditional baked beans with a hint of jalapeno."}
{"text":"This food is BANG'N!!! Great BBQ, great beer, great atmosphere. If you love BBQ it is a must try in Northeast Ohio"}
{"text":"Pulled pork tacos great!  Salmon and filet special excellent. Nice atmosphere. Good acoustics, not too loud. Ice cream stout dessert great too!  Bartenders were engaging and efficient. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow seemed unconcerned with us spare ribs were burnt very difficult to eat soup was cold french fries were cold and string beans were cold mashed potatoes were cold ...pricey.
Last time we came it was four or five stars this time one won't be going back"}
{"text":"Loved it! This was our second visit.  We brought friends that loved it too.
The burnt ends are amazing.  I will get them every time.
My husband calls the ribs \"Fred Flintstone ribs\" because they're so big and meaty.  We can't wait for the Twinsburg/Hudson location to open."}
{"text":"Delicious bbq'd meats, casual but cool atmosphere, well priced and tons of beverage selections. Excellent pulled pork. Definitely recommended and will return. Kid-friendly."}
{"text":"Best restaurant ribs I've ever found. I had green beans as a side dish which were fresh, perfectly cooked and seasoned well. In a word excellent.  Service was good too."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good service, reasonable prices and great food.   If you like smoked meats you can't go wrong at Oak and Embers."}
{"text":"My husband and I both love their food.  Burger is great. Burnt ends are great. Smoked chicken wings insane. Roast beef also great."}
{"text":"Chicken Tacos are wonderful as is anything off of the BBQ.  Nice selection of Craft beers. Wait staff the best!  Dana behind the bar makes it perfect."}
{"text":"What a bummer. Looked forward to smoked BBQ. Good reviews and the Michael Symon hype. Started with burnt ends & pork tacos. Burnt ends not crispy several were all fat. Pork taco tasteless and soggy. My wife's brisket was dry. I tried the three item sampler. Sausage was ok. Ribs fell off the bone and fell apart. Had been in a warming tray for some time. Chicken a bit dry. Green beans undercooked no seasoning. Bar service inconsistent."}
{"text":"Tomato Basil Soup - THE BEST EVER!  Love, Love, Love this soup.  Comes with a piece of corn bread on the side.  Both the tomato basil soup and corn bread is EXCELLENT.  Please try.  You will be so happy."}
{"text":"Me and a friend went here last night. I got the pick 3 meats and comes with 2 sides & corn bread for 25.00.....so worth it. Meat portions were a nice size, not small. Side dishes were normal size. Corn bread was a nice size piece as well. All home made and freaking amazing. Service was on point. Every single aspect of that dinner was GREAT! I'll def be back and I will be telling people about this hidden gem in Chesterland. Thanks for such a great dinner!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a while and find the food consistently good. We are very happy they are now taking reservations because the only downside before was the wait. Definitely recommend for great barbeque"}
{"text":"i am very glad i heard about this place in the radio it was clean and the food was awesome. been to about every bbq joint in northeast ohio and this is now my new fav though i will be heading to mabels soon."}
{"text":"Came as part of a group of 6.  We chose it because it was on the way home from another event and it popped up on one of our phones as being nearby.  We knew nothing about it, other than the location was convenient for us.  Boy were we happy to make this find!  Doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's large and modern inside.  we arrived for lunch at 2 on a Saturday, and we waited a few minutes.  All tables were full.  So we knew it had to be good.  Special of the day was duck confit, how often do you see that?  Everything on the menu looked great, and it was really hard to choose.  3 of us had the fried goat cheese and roasted beet salad, one had a roasted turkey wrap, one had the crab cake appetizer, and one had the BBQ chicken salad.  Everyone loved every bite.  Incredibly delicious.  Very nice waitress.  I could live without the country music, but I guess it goes with the theme.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  But be prepared to wait.  Tonight we placed an online order which was supposedly ready for pickup at 6:39.  It's 7:08 and I'm still waiting here.  Unfortunately this is a common occurrence here.  But the food is good so we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"White cheddar grits with brisket, great combo. Awesome bourbon and beer selection as well!"}
{"text":"So after reading mixed reviews I was a little apprehensive... I really enjoyed the food here. We had the pork tacos to start and they were very good. The apple slaw was really delicious. They were a little \"drippy\" but that was my only complaint. I got the brisket melt and it was AMAZING... Moist brisket, the pepper spread and mushroom sauce were incredible. My fiancé got the chorizo meatloaf and he said it was better than mine, which was previously his favorite food. Although that makes me a bit jealous, they should take it as a great compliment. The only reason I don't give this place five stars was the hostesses were super slow and didn't seem to know what they were doing, they quoted us way longer than the actual wait time. We actually almost left after being told 30 min wait, but after seeing there was only one party ahead of us, I opted to stay. Glad we did! 


Update: went again and it was delicious!! BUT the magician creepin around while you wait for your food to come was WEIRD. I totally get it might be entertaining when waiting for a table but it's very awkward when eating!"}
{"text":"Really good barbecue and nice portions. Waitstaff is prompt and friendly. We're regulars!"}
{"text":"After a recent Sunday afternoon visit, and reading the reviews, I can cut to the chase on this place. Go in knowing that you are going to wait for your food longer than you would normally.  The drinks are interesting so if you bring good company - it shouldn't be a problem.  PS - kids don't wait well. 

They serve more than bbq -  8 regulars sat at the table next to us - just one had bbq and all the meals looked fabulous. The bbq is excellent and portions are large. A full order of ribs serves 3.  They have ONE sauce that they serve on the meat.  It's sweet but, it's good.  The ribs were superior in flavor and quality.  The brisket has little to no fat.  We felt the rest were good - average bbq fair.  The sides we had were love/hate. The dirty grits are to die for.  I could bathed in the stuff.  We  enjoyed the cheesy succotash as well.  The baked beans were not even close to the best we have ever had and the apple slaw is just wrong. A dish made by a 5 year old.  The cornbread is unique.  Our visit was enjoyable - we will be back.  The next time we will be having the burnt ends appetizer (70% of the tables while we were there - got them) and smoked wings to go with our  delicious dirty rice."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork platter.  Very good and the service was very friendly.  Would be 5 stars but sat in a table down the middle.  Felt a little cramped."}
{"text":"The Cajun shrimp tacos and crab cakes were delicious even though the BBQ is delicious we decided to venture out and were very pleased!"}
{"text":"Really good smoked menu, just not much of a variety of tastes. Great friendly staff in the evenings. Beer taps never change and the mason jars or large frosted water glasses indicate they have no clue or care about serving craft beer."}
{"text":"It's been a week now and I had some time to think about our experience we had here on New Years Eve. We made reservations for dinner about a week in advance for New Years Eve when we arrived for dinner the hostess looked confused we were there but she found our names for dinner. Shortly there after the manager came out and apologized to us but they made a mistake and could not seat us for dinner. They had a private party for that night. So my only experience was not good since every place in town was booked being New Years. So thanks for ruining our evening"}
{"text":"Finally, a real authentic BBQ place in the area!  The restaurant itself is located in an unassuming strip mall in Chesterland.  The smell of smoke fills the air as you enter the doors, giving you a tantalizing hint of what's to come.  Our service was good, not bad or inconsistent like some other reviewers have stated.  We each ordered the full rack of ribs and they're bathed in one of the best bbq sauces I have ever had-smokey, sweet, with just a touch of spicy goodness.  The ribs were meaty, with a nice smoke ring, and tender.  The full rack was filling, we took half racks home.  The sides were good- baked beans, creamy succotash, and cornbread that was sweet, not dry, and didn't need butter to make it better.  The bourbon selections were very good.  If you want some real, authentic bbq, this is the place.  We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Lots and lots of food for the money. Nice service and atmosphere. Pretty good bbq too."}
{"text":"I love this place. When visiting family that lives here, we come here. Food is great and plentiful. I had the brisket sandwich...sooo goood. Come here hungry!"}
{"text":"LUNCH. First time here, I had the pulled pork sandwich that was very good, great smoke flavor. Wife had the turkey wrap and said it was outstanding, real turkey meat not the deli meat that usually comes on a wrap. We also had the tomato basil soup that was rich creamy and very good. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best bbq I've had in a long time.  Great portion sizes. Service was great. Worth the 40 minute drive. If we lived closer this would be our hang out."}
{"text":"I took my mom to Oak and Embers for the Mother's Day brunch buffet and it was absolutely amazing! The buffet offered a variety of things such as an omelette station, bacon, sausage, potatoes, a carving station with several smoked meats and this crab stuffed grouper that was THE BOMB!!! Everyone from the serving staff that we encountered was friendly and willing to help assist or answer any questions that we had. This was both my mom and I's first time dining at Oak and Embers, and we will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Best BBQ ever! Try the burnt ends, smoked wings and dirty grits. Nothing will disappoint you."}
{"text":"My new fave thing on the menu?  BBQ flatbread with smoked chicken.  It seriously might be the best thing on their menu.

Just know:sometimes this place can get short-staffed, and you can wait for your food for 45 minutes. The server will tell you your food is on its way 5 time before it actually shows up."}
{"text":"Recent visit ordered the short ribs, dirty grits, roasted brussel sprouts and cornbread.  Simply delicious!  I like that the BBQ sauce isn't too sweet but perfect combination.  I got an education on Bourbon as well.  Efficient and friendly staff."}
{"text":"We were in from out of town for a dog show.  We looked for places with outdoor seating may be dog friendly.  They were extremely accommodating!   The food was wonderful, the server was awesome, and everyone was excited to see our dogs."}
{"text":"mediocre restaurant at best. Crammed seating and slow service. Would not recommend. Poor food seemed undercooked."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, I really did. We looked at the menu and it seemed amazing! Don't get me wrong, the food was good..but underwhelming is how I can best describe it. The beer selection is great, the atmosphere is cool but the food was not all I   thought it would be. Would definitely go again, but would not go out of my way. Decent, very decent, just not exactly what I thought it was going to be. The locals seem to love it because it is always packed...so maybe it was just me and my husband. Maybe we are the problem. LOL"}
{"text":"Went there again!  Why does my hubby want to eat here!  On the good side the food is more consistent.  They seem to have mastered that.  On the bad side, waiter forgot my wine.  They are out of cheesecake dessert.  My hips probably don't need it anyway.  But the Food to the table, YOU GOTTA figure this out. Why is it a half hour to an hour???"}
{"text":"Ok, ironically my wife and I were looking for a good dinner and happened across this place on Yelp, it had all 4 and 5 stars ... just finished dinner, look at my rating."}
{"text":"Overall it was a good experience, servers were fast friendly and attentive.  The food was good but not great, the burnt ends app was very good and a large portion. The chorizo meat loaf sandwich was good but not great, there was not much smoke flavor at all but I did enjoy the meat combination for a meat loaf, the bbg sauce was very good I like the bourbon flavor of it. The sides were good, apple slaw, grits, succotash  and corn bread were very good.  The strawberry short cake desert was like eating a dessert with wiped cream, very very dry. It was not a bad first experience we will be back again to make are final decision weather or not the bbq is up to snuff. Till then I would definitely give this place a try. (P.s. burgers brew and que blew the flavors out off proportion )"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times, the new and the old location, and they are both excellent.  Our first couple times we were with large groups so i kind of had a taste of all the smoked meats.  The chicken,brisket, pulled pork, all amazing. The smoked wings are a step up from regular wings and that says a lot for me as chicken wings would be part of my death row meal.  The ribs.   The ribs.  The ribs.  Ive had the baby backs a couple of times there and they are everything you want in bbq ribs.   They rank up there with the best ive ever had.  Everyone wants to say so and so's are the best down south blah blah blah but the truth is if you want damn good bbq in NE ohio, check this joint out you'll go home feeling a little guilty cuz you just smashed a whole rack of ribs and it feels good."}
{"text":"We arrived for our reservation significantly early and were immediately seated.  The brisket was absolutely delicious.  The ribs were meaty and tender.  Sweet potato fries were slightly crispy, just how I like them.  Our server, Alexis, was attentive and very friendly, the best server I had anyhere in a long time!"}
{"text":"They have good chicken and waffles.  I like their wait staff.  As an African-American I feel a bit out of place in here - but I really have no reason too.  Everyone is friendly and courteous and the food IS good."}
{"text":"I was excited to visit this place after reading the reviews. Started with the Fried Goat Cheese and Beet Salad. It was fresh, flavorful , and I loved the fried goat cheese. Next was the Pick Three; Ribs, pulled pork, and brisket.  The ribs were dry and they tried to cover it up with sauce. The brisket seemed a little old and flavorless. The pulled pork was good. The Dirty Grits, Apple Slaw, and Mac & Cheese were all good. Maybe we were there on an off night, but the bbq was disappointing. I would consider visiting again, but maybe just for some pulled pork   and sides."}
{"text":"Heard really good things about this place from multiple family friends so we decided to check it out on a Sunday night. The hostess seated us right on top of another family even though there were PLENTY of open tables. The elementary age girl sitting behind me would not stop kicking my chair. The beer selection was pretty good and the happy hour deal made the tall beer cheaper than the short (not that I needed an excuse to order the tall, lol). I ordered the Cajun shrimp tacos off the small plates and a cup of the tomato bisque. I was happy with my meal, I just wish that there were more fixings for the tacos other than lettuce and tomato. The soup was fantastic. My brother orders ribs everywhere we go and he was not a fan of the ones he ordered. He also had the five cheese Mac and cheese, but it literally had ZERO flavor. My dad had the brisket and said it was good but nothing to rave about. My mom had the BLT, which she was happy with because she liked the spicy sauce on it.

This place has a lot of potential, but they just aren't there yet.  We met the owner who says he hand picks the meat every two days and talked about how they just moved into this new location. In my opinion, this place earns more stars when they upgrade their service and add more flavor to their food."}
{"text":"2nd visit. This place is great. The food is unbelievably good.  Prices a more than fair. The service is good. 
I could go on & on but you have to come out and experience it for yourself!!
*******  Fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Will not be back...Had lunch today with a friend here and I'm sorry to say it was my first and last visit, I ordered a full rack of ribs with fries and Mac n cheese. My friend ordered half a slab with the brisket and she had Mac n cheese and the cheddar mashed potatoes which she said were kind of dry and lacking flavor. Overall the food was very good it's the service and professionalism of the management that left a bad taste! She and I were saying how we would be back for sure before we ordered dessert. I ordered cheesecake which was very good and she ordered the \"Boilermaker\"chocolate cake. Well her cake arrived in a narrow necked mason type jar which made eating it difficult so she opted to spoon it out onto the plate it arrived on. That cake was so dry it was unbelievable! When our server brought our check my friend asked that the rather pricey cake be removed from our bill. Well, she was met with a bitch face and a comment that she'd have to ask the manager. My friend had taken maybe three bites of the cake! So the manager arrived table side with a really nasty confrontational attitude. He stated he had removed the item from the bill but wanted to know what was wrong with it. She explained to him how dry it was and he then argued that it had just been made the day before. He proceeded to bully her and question her about the cake and at one point my friend said she didn't like because it was dry and his comment was\"well you ordered it\"!! He then said you realize now that I've taken it off your bill I have to pay for it !!! I have never been so appalled at a supposed managers behavior in my life !! I was totally uncomfortable and will never go back which is a shame because the food was good ! I would be afraid I'd run into this guy again ! Someone needs to school him in customer service. I think the better approach would have been to apologize and if he really wanted to know what was wrong with the cake he could have asked my friend for her suggestion on how it could be improved!! Not to bully her and get into her face !!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that when we pulled into the parking lot we almost left. It is very dirty and the front of the restaurant is not very inviting. We were seated quickly but had to wait a while for our server. We ordered our drinks (diet coke and a lemonade) and waited for our food. It took a little longer than we thought it should but we liked what we ordered. I had a sandwich and fries, my husband got the pork chop. My husband asked the waitress for another lemonade and in a slightly haughty tone told him that it is handmade and there are NO free refills....ok then!
We waited (again) for our check and when she brought it we noticed they charged us the wrong amount for the pork chop. Rather than wait another 20 minutes for her to figure it out we paid and left. On the way out my husband grabbed a menu to make sure we were right about the price...there were 3 employees standing there watching us take the menu off of the hostess station. Not one asked if we needed help. So.....I don't think we will be returning...."}
{"text":"We had shared the pick three from the smoker which was perfect for two people. The brisket was great as well as the mussels! Great place!"}
{"text":"We tried Oak & Embers Tavern based strictly off photos posted on Facebook. We had booked our reservation weeks in advance, walked in and were seated immediately and started with drinks, nice strong drinks!  The appetizer was a special for the night, nachos that were extraordinary and our dinners were no less that that as well. I had ribs, mac n cheese and sweet potato fries. Large portion and very tasty!  I always worry ribs will be hard to clean the meat off the bone, no worries here came right off. My hubby had the salmon, which he said may have been the best he has ever had!  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"What an awesome find!  Food is terrific and worth going a bit out of our way for this happening place.  Loved the waitress who's brother is the chef.  Best MAC & Cheese I've ever had - no really it is!  And I'm a Beecher Cheese  fan so that's saying a lot!"}
{"text":"Excellent. My steak was perfect. Everyone got something different. From the salads to the BBQ not single complaint. The cheese grits were excellent. 
The one drawback is that service is  bit slow. Though don't let that keep you from trying this gem."}
{"text":"The food has always been great but tonight was what made the review.  After taking the kids to countless Santa visits, tonight was really top notch.  My kids were convinced he was the real Santa- they kept asking him questions and he answered without hesitation.  Our waitress, at first seemed to be a waitress on top of her game but about half way through our dinner, started making amazing balloon figurines for the rest of the night. (Kids were convinced it was a secret mission from the elf reporting to santa on their behavior at restaurants.) We had a party of 15 total and it was a seamless night. Thanks Oak and Embers for keeping things magical and also for having some top notch beer for the hub's to try.  I know I sound like an ad but hats off to you.  They also had crafts.......and they were crafts that were thought out, the kind you want to hang on your tree, not toss in the trash when you get home. Refreshing. :)"}
{"text":"We had the burnt ends to start and they were great. I had the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries and it was super. The barbecue sauce is sweet and tangy. Finish it off with your choice of beer and it made for a great lunch. The store doesn't look like much on the outside but the food and service is a pleasant surprise once you go in. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good meal and good service. The place is not pretentious just good and worth a visit."}
{"text":"This is difficult. I know the food is good, but the kitchen is SOOOO backed up the hour wait for food wasn't worth the hour and fifteen minute wait for a table.  (PS still waiting for food)"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Oak and Embers now since about the time they opened and were at the first location down the street from where they are now. My go to is the grouper with sweet potato fries and it is always spot on. They are consistently on top of their food and it's all fabulous. My husband usually gets the buttermilk chicken and waffles. We typically come a couple times a month and haven't been disappointed, even as they have gained popularity, the quality of the food and service hasn't wavered."}
{"text":"Nothing that tastes as good as the meatloaf can be legal. I'm still dreaming about that freaking meatloaf and the silky smooth mashed potatoes. This is not your mama's meatloaf. Oh, no. This is something that you've never tasted. The burnt ends appetizer with their sauce were so tender, and I highly recommend the BLT deviled eggs.  The bacon jam on top is addicting. A fantastic selection of beer and well stocked bar with some magical concoctions. We will make a special trip to Cleveland to eat here. Service was great and they take great pride in their food."}
{"text":"Just a suggestion. Unless you want to have leftovers for the next days lunch, order small. The portions are huge.  My brisket sandwich was enough to fill me up, share with my husband, and have leftovers the next day. That being said the brisket sandwich was so smoky and flavorful and Tasty. Service was excellent for our large group (30). Thanks for a memorable evening!"}
{"text":"Yummy!! Get the Burnt Ends & Plantains - so good! Dinner was Pulled Pork w/ mac & cheese and apple slaw - yum yum! Also at the table was the Brisket and baked beans - delicious! First time visit but won't be the last. Just wish we didn't live an hour away! !"}
{"text":"Went out with my boyfriend for dinner, beer selection is great. 

We ordered the burnt tips, Caesar salad, plantains came with the meal. Was honestly terrible and overpriced. 

Only fun part was they had a face painter that made our night better, will not be returning."}
{"text":"We visited this location for the second time on sweetest day, after such a great experience with our first visit. The wait was nearly an hr and this was frustrating watching people who had reservations jump in front while standing and waiting. It also was frustrating not having pages or cell phone system, or app to keep track of seating. They also had large parties of people sitting and not eating but just watching the football game. 

The Cuban bean soup was good and so was her salad we got for apps. Once we waited and waited we finally got to order. But then our server never returned until a half hour later. Our fries were average and the apple slaw was mostly Apple which created a unequal balance. The beans were undercooked and didn't have enough sauce on them.  

My sausage was good and so was her pulled pork. But like other reviews were Is the sauce it's scarce. The service was slow and wait painful. The apps just need some fine tuning I mean how hard is it to make fries,

This location is a few simple things away from being amazing."}
{"text":"Great BBQ selection and always has bourbon barrel aged ale on tap!  Awesome service and very accommodating!  Worth a little extra driving distance."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time after hearing about this place and more recently seeing it on Michael Symon's new show on Food Network - Burgers, Brew & 'Que.  This is a newer location which was previously Spectators.  The owners have done a nice job remodeling both the inside and the patio to convert this space from a sports bar into something more rustic.

We arrived at approx 12:00 for lunch.  There was one larger party in the back and a good number of smaller groups throughout the restaurant.  The waitress promptly came to the table to take drink orders.  She returned with the drinks and to take our orders.  We asked what she recommends and she informed us they were out of the burnt ends \"thanks to --stupid-- Michael Symon\"  (not sure I would be calling that man stupid...guessing his show is bringing some business in)  This was disappointing though as the small plate looked great on the show.  Someone else told us later that they can't keep up with them - semi understandable as it's not something that can be made quickly...takes time to smoke and it's only been a week since the show aired.  

I had the Smoked Chorizo Meatloaf Sandwhich - fantastic!!  I asked which side the waitress suggested and she let us know they were all sold out of the cheddar mashed potatoes.  This was also disappointing.  She said the large party (looked to be about 20 people) cleaned them out.  Now - it's understandable something like burnt ends takes some significant time to make....being out of mashed potatoes though after only 1 hour of service (open at 11:00 - it was only 12:00 at this point)  She recommended the mac and cheese. The other folks I was with ordered the special of the day which was - Brined and Slow Smoked Pork Loin with Mango-Pepper Salsa and Melted White Cheddar on a Toasted Brioche Bun served with choice of a Scratch-Made Side and a Pickle.  

The meatloaf was fantastic....this was featured on Michael Symon's show as well.  Excellent flavor and was a good consistency and was moist despite being smoked and grilled.  The mac and cheese was good as well.  The others weren't overly impressed by the pork sandwich - they said it was extremely dry and not a lot of flavor to it.  The food took some time to come up.  They visibly seemed to be a little overwhelmed between the larger party and what must have been an increase in the number of people they expect in for lunch.  Guessing that being featured on the tv show with \"stupid\" Michael Symon (see above) may have had something to do with that.  Once the dust settles I'll give the place another try.  Everything coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled fantastic."}
{"text":"Made reservations, when we got there they could not find the reservation, they were very busy and we had to wait about 30 minutes for our table. We each had a half slab of ribs with two sides. The ribs were very meaty and out of 6 bones I could only eat 3 of them, mainly because they were very meaty but not very tasty, they seem over cooked. Sides were fair. Price in line with other BBQ restaurants, place was very loud."}
{"text":"Wow - what a joy to discover this place! We have driven by many times but never even stopped to find out what was happening here, thinking it was just a local bar. WRONG. 

The brisket was excellent, as was the sauce - tangy and it overly sweet. The cream cheese spread sounded weird - but turned out to be a perfect pairing. My favorite part of the meal was the chef's vegetable of the day: Butternut squash paired with corn and red onion. Outstanding! The cornbread was the deciding factor for me; light and perfectly sweetened. 

Elizabeth was an excellent server and went out of her way to accommodate our request for a specific table in the patio. 

Great meal, excellent environment. It was like being in Texas for great barbecue, without the travel! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Very good food that is unique in many ways. The service is great. I highly recommend trying lots of oak and embers apps. I love the chicken and waffles. The syrup was very tasty. The app I highly recommend is the burnt ends. It doesn't sound very tasty but it is melt in your mouth goodness"}
{"text":"The three stars are for the food. The blank two, one for the service and one for the dirty grits. We have re-named the dirty grits to the dirty shits. Watch out, you will be knocking your boots in the bathroom the second they hit your lips. My brother-in-law got so sick right after we asked for the check and we narrowed it down to this, the dirty shits was the only thing he had that no one else tried. Lucky for the waitress, we ordered another round while we waited for him to finish his business. Onto the waitress......either she was having an OFF day or she did not understand anything we were saying.  We had to repeat everything back to her.....\"we will have the crab cakes.....'the what?'.....crrraaaabbbbb cakkkess.\" We ordered a good amount of appetizers, we had 4 minutes to decide what we wanted for a main course. Wait, our appetizers haven't even made it into the computer yet and you are rushing us into ordering our main dish. That's a NO NO. It was 10pm on a Saturday and we checked your page and it said open until 2:30am. We have at least 3 hours before we should feel rushed. She did not want to wait on us. Back to the food, order a little bit of everything except for....you know. We gave this place a try and we will have to see how long it will take for us to come back."}
{"text":"Food was OK - nothing to brag about.  Service could have been much better.  Waiter literally threw a piece of paper on the table and said \"Here's today's special.\"  A few of the featured draft beers were not available."}
{"text":"So excited to find great BBQ in the Cleveland area! Great food, environment and  service. Especially enjoyed the smoky, tender brisket and the crisp, flavorful chicken with waffle. Sweet potato fries and cheesy grits were excellent sides. Nice that kids can draw write on the \"tablecloth\" - anything to make waiting for the food more enjoyable Is a plus! Can't wait to go back to try more!"}
{"text":"I went for my first time... the waitress didn't treat us good :(
My wife asked couple questions about the food and she kept saying Im not sure Im not sure, then she said: so whats your order! Well you need to make sure to answer our questions first!
The food was little late and when I called her and asked her, she literally said:\"why? Do you guys have any place to go!!\" When I said Yes.. she said: I will print the check for you so when the food come you can eat and pay quickly..! 
I like the place and the food but I dont like the service.. and the waitress!"}
{"text":"The ribs are ok
The fried chicken is less then fair.sides are best of all.why it is busy who knows but surely there are much better around."}
{"text":"I was reluctant to try this place because so many Yelp reviews commented on service being slow. But a friend recommended we try it since we enjoy BBQ. 

We visited on Sun., 10/15/17 @ 4:40 pm. The restaurant is located at the west end of a strip plaza so it can be a bit difficult to see from the road. Never having dined here, we actually passed it once before locating it.

The interior has a country/industrial decor with a bar, multiple televisions, & a large dining area. Several booths are along the wall with most of the seating being tables which can be joined for larger parties. About half the dining room was occupied so we were promptly seated.

I ordered the smoked sausage & my wife ordered a half-rack of ribs. Both of us chose the cheddar smashed potatoes & baked beans for our sides. Because so many reviews commented on the service, I actually timed it.

It took 30 minutes for our meals to be served though I suspect 10 of those minutes were spent on the warming shelf in the kitchen. Our food was lukewarm. When butter doesn't melt on your potatoes or cornbread, you have a problem with serving temperature. The sides tasted good; they simply weren't hot enough.

My wife said the ribs were very good. I thought the smoked sausage was a bit dry. I did not care for the sauce; too sweet. Overall, it was an average experience &, because of the distance from where we live, one not worth repeating.
______________

If you have read my review to this point, please keep me motivated by voting my review as 'useful'."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food. If you decide to visit, come with an empty stomach. They will defiantly  fill it up. Don't let the outside fool you, this place is well worth a visit."}
{"text":"The smell alone is worth a visit!  Delicious smoked meats & large portions at an excellent price.  This has become one of my whole families favorite spots. Our favorites are the burnt ends & cornbread."}
{"text":"I give this place a four star only because the atmosphere is really nice and the customer service is excellent. Our experience today as far as the food goes was not very good. The smoked wings were good as far as the smoke flavor and seasoning, I wish they would have flash fried them to give them a little crisp. They were a little rubbery. The jumbo lump crab cake appetizer (nothing jumbo there). All the meats seemed to be very dry and unetable. Maybe they were having kitchen problems. The mac n cheese and cheesy succotash were to liquidy, saucy not cheesy and under seasoned. Not what I would expect for a bbq restaurant. Maybe next time we will have a better experience."}
{"text":"Nice decor inside and good beer selection. Food was below average-burnt ends were fatty and chicken and waffles were dry."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice now and I am addicted!!! We went recently for a Saturday night dinner and also went yesterday for Easter Sunday and had their brunch buffet. 

The first time we were alone without kids and yesterday we had both children and my mother. Both times we were promptly greeted and seated. Our first time we had the burnt ends appetizer and my husband had the smoked 3 meat combo. He has a smoker at home and loves to try others products and he was not let down. He had the brisket, chicken, and ribs. All were outstanding... Especially the smoked chicken!!! It was awesome! I had a steak special of the night and was very happy!!! The sides are amazing... The grits were so yummy and I loved their cornbread!!! I want their recipe!!!!  Service was spot on especially for a Saturday evening.

Yesterday we had sooo many special items that are probably are not on their normal menu... I absolutely loved smoked ham! It was soooo good! I again had grits and they were outstanding! Everyone was super friendly that was working too. Our server was beyond kind and also was amazing to my 17 month old baby!  

The service, the food, the drinks are what make me want to keep coming back here!!! I can't wait to come back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Third or fourth time here. Absolutely mouthwatering smoked meats, ribs, house made smoked sausage and brisket. Can't go wrong with the succotash for a side.  I usually get the white cheddar  grits three out of four times awesome tonight not so much. That could have been corrected if our waitress checked on us before we finished. Again, before tonight never had bad service here. Will come back for sure. Like I said it 3 out of four isn't bad. This place is definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Love the food, good service and portion sizes are perfect. Been here several times and have not had a single bad experience."}
{"text":"Food is excellent on a consistent basis. Specials are imaginative and very tasty. They are always willing to accommodate my palate which can't handle spicy food. Wait staff is attentive. My husband and I go weekly."}
{"text":"Great food, good service and a pleasant atmosphere.  I had the pulled pork and apple slaw and I loved them both. I'm sure I'll be back often to try the other temptations on the menu."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. I only had one complaint, the appetizer came out after we were nearly done eating our entrees, they should've taken a percentage of the app off due to this fact. The waitresses are always friendly though."}
{"text":"Delicious barbecue and a great atmosphere. I had the pulled pork and brisket two meat combo with fries and mac&cheese. Wife had half slab of ribs with Apple slaw and beans. Pork and brisket were delicious and had a good smoke flavor with the right amount of bark to give you that extra flavor of the rub used. Meat was not fatty, but had enough for flavoring. The rub was perfect with a slight heat in the seasoning. Fries were hand cut and the mac&cheese was tasty. The macaroni was a bit over cooked though. I expected this as most often restaurant mac&cheese is like this. It is difficult to maintain the proper tenseness for the macaroni. Ribs were very meaty and flavorful. Beans were not overly sweet and not was the apple slaw. The wife really enjoyed the slaw and said it complemented her food as the vinegar helped cut through the fat if the meat. The cornbread was okay. That is from my personal preference. I found it to be too dense and have a sweetened glaze to it that was too sweet. Again this is just my personal views. Everyone seemed to have enjoyed it. We will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best BBQ around! Portion sizes are large- doggie bags for all! Great Brisket! Cheddar mashed potatoes are to die for. Green beans are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I found out about this spot because it's damn good!  I didn't know this existed until I visited a friend out in that area and he suggested we swing by for some grub.  We had smoked wings, burnt ends, the queso dip (comes with large pork rinds instead of chips!!), and some drinks.  The drinks were cheap.  It's was like $4 for a really good IPA and $7.50 for a bourbon cocktail.  The smoke flavor was awesome and the hot wings had a great sauce flavor that wasn't just some Franks Red Hot and butter.  They made a real wing sauce I liked it a lot!  The wings were also huge.  The BBQ sauce on the burnt ends tasted great... not just some dressed up ketchup.  And the burnt ends included some good cuts of meat with actual burnt ends, which was a surprise.  Lastly, the queso dip with pork rinds was a treat.  I love using pork rinds instead of chips for dipping and to see  restaurant actually do this put me in heaven!  There was a don of meat and cheese... and flavor in that dip.  Everything was well worth the price, which seemed low in my opinion.  I would have paid more lol.  The service was friendly and the place was clean.  I'm going to be back for some ribs and bigger stuff very soon."}
{"text":"My wife, parents and I had been planning a trip to Oak & Embers for a while. When we finally went it did not disappoint.  We shared a burnt ends appetizer that was excellent except that the plantain chips were under-seasoned, but the brisket was tender and very flavorful in the whiskey bbq sauce that they slather on it. It is also a big portion that was easily shared by four people.

The dinner salad was simple and fresh (just so we could all say we had something healthy). 

My wife had the pulled pork platter, the rest of us had ribs.  The ribs were very meaty and well smoked with a good seasoning. They weren't too saucy which I like. My wife's pulled pork was excellent as well. All the platters are enormous, especially for the price. BBQ joints have become very lean with their portions for the money. Here a full slab of ribs and two sides is on $23 and it would take an enormous appetite to finish it, and the pulled pork plate is under $15.  I look forward to going back and trying the brisket platter, but did not have it this time because we had the burnt ends appetizer. Each side is almost a pint. The cheesy grits and the dirty grits are both very good, not overly salty which sometimes happens. The mac and cheese was also very satisfying not \"watery\" but still smooth and seasoned with black pepper well. We were also very impressed with both the regular and sweet potato both were clearly fresh cut and fried really."}
{"text":"Meat was really good, as was the service and cleanliness.  The barbecue sauce was way too sweet, and I needed to doctor it up with sriracha.  Same with the baked beans.  The mac was good as well as the coleslaw.  I am usually a cornbread lover- but it was too dense, dry, and the corn pieces in it a little chewy/waxy."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in here at 9 p.m. on a busy Saturday night. Seems like a pretty hopping place not much has changed since the last time we were there. Our server was busy attending to two other rather large parties so we expected a bit of a delay it was about seven minutes to greet 15 minutes total from seat to drink. It shouldn't take 15 minutes to get a beer.

We didn't order an appetizer and seeing how busy are server was we figured we'd better know what we want cuz I don't know when we're going to see her again. Wife ordered the salmon I ordered the half chicken with cheddar smashed potatoes and we split a Caesar salad beforehand. What I was envisioning with the cheddar smashed potatoes and what I got were two entirely different things. The potatoes were neither cheddar nor smashed. They were boxed powder potato flakes with absolutely zero cheese or cheddar mixed in and I will argue to my dying day if anyone tries to tell me they were real potatoes.

My half chicken tasted like it had been sitting in a warming drawer for about a day and was all sorts of dried out. The wife's maple glazed salmon was a finely cooked piece of fish however it was not maple-flavored nor or any sort of glaze on it. Either we had some kitchen staff that was unaware was supposed to be maple glazed over there was a change in the menu.

Lastly I went to the restroom. What a disgusting act that was. I realize it was a busy Saturday night however you should periodically have people check on the status of the restroom. The floor was disgustingly sticky, there's no paper towels, and the drain in the floor was missing the protective grate that went over it so there was a 4 inch hole in the floor.  I told one of the employees about it he clearly seemed disinterested in addressing the issue.

Two stars because they had neat beer glasses."}
{"text":"With all of the regional BBQ competition that's cropped up over the last year or so, I think it's getting pretty tough for places to differentiate themselves from the smoked meat masses. Oak & Embers is good, but it just didn't impress. From service missteps to a so-so atmosphere with OK-not-great food, it was just not something I'll find myself craving again.

We arrived sometime around 5pm on a Saturday. We were in the area doing our orchard visits (BTW, Patterson Fruit Farm was a nightmarish madhouse) and since you Yelpers were raving about it, we couldn't resist. There's an outside patio that looks pretty cozy, but we opted for the internal experience on our visit. 

There were kids all over the place. Enough to make us take note of it, anyway. I'm a \"seen and not heard\" guy when it comes to kids but it would seem that parents nowadays would rather be their kids' friend rather than discipline them. Whatever, moving on.

The Service (C-)

Our server was very friendly, and I know this is not an issue for everyone, but when I asked some questions about the beer menu he replied. \"I'm not a beer person so I don't know much about it.\". Speaking of which, my wife attempted to order a beer and was told that they hadn't tapped it yet? What? Does this mean you have the keg but that someone hasn't taken the 10 minutes or less that it would take to snap on the coupling? If you can't serve it, take it off the menu or inform the customers before they order.

Here's the real let down. The pacing. Sloooowwww. We waited about 25 minutes for our food to arrive after we ordered it. Isn't BBQ basically done already? Shouldn't it just be cutting the portions, putting the on the plate and spooning the sides into bowls? Anyway, this place was an exercise in waiting and it really tried my patience. 

The Atmosphere (C)

It was pretty loud and it has this honky-tonk bar feel. Felt like there should have been a mechanical bull in the lobby. During our visit they had all of the televisions turned way up with the Indians game on. Add the annoying audience clapping/hooting/hollering and it made it pretty difficult to have a conversation. Not everyone cares about sports.  We were seated in the side dining area which sort of feels like you're at a wedding reception with its hotel-esque furnishings and metal, stackable chairs. On the positive side, at least the chairs were padded.

The Food (C)

Just sorta, kinda, ya know, pretty good. Right in the middle of the OK curve. Maybe those closer to the area really dig it but there's great BBQ closer to Cleveland so I don't have to drive 45 minutes to seek it out. I loved the level of smoke on all of the meat, though. It was just right and the aroma and flavor it imparted to the finished product is mouth-watering. 

For our dinner we got two Pick 2 platters ($22 each) so we were able to try 4 different sides and 4 different meats. Both came with corn bread. Here's how it went:

The Sauce - A very sweet, smokey tomato-based red sauce that's generously dribbled over the meat. I prefer to add sauce myself, but that's just me. It's tasty, but I thought it lacked heat.

Mushy White Bread - I understand the serving bread with BBQ thing. Sopping up sauce and all, but what's with serving the meat on top of the bread? It just turns into a soggy, gloppy mess.

The cornbread - An utter disaster. In a word - dry. How dry was it? This cornbread is so dry it nearly turned to dust when I bit into it. If you put some in your mouth without immediately taking a drink of water to reconstitute it you're gonna have swallowing challenges.

The Brisket - I rather enjoyed this. Tender, beefy and moist, with just the right amount of fatty bits. Beautiful smoke ring, too.

Smoked Sausage - Another winner. Great seasoning with a perfect snap to the casing. This porky goodness paired perfectly with their sauce.

Pulled Pork - Ugh. Fatty, fatty, fatty. And not the good, melt in your mouth kind. Just gets a little gross after it cools. The meat we managed to release from its adipose prison was tasty, though.

Chicken - Some of the juiciest, smokiest most delicious BBQ chicken I've had in some time. Sure, you've gotta work it off the carcass yourself, but that's part of the fun, right?

Sides:

Equal parts hit and miss. All of the sides we had were missing salt. The mac and cheese was ok, reminded me of Stouffers in that mushy, not stringy kind of way. The baked beans were very smokey and had a tomato-y aftertaste that wasn't altogether unpleasant. The apple slaw needed more dressing. It just wasn't juicy enough and the pieces of apple were cut way too large. Our server raved about the cheesy succotash. It was yummy and cheesy, with a soup-like consistency.

Apple Cake - A delicious highlight. Not too sweet, apply, hints of molassas with creamy ice cream. Bring on the autumn, man.

So there you have it. Another sort-of-Cleveland-area BBQ joint. It was pretty good, just not \"I can't wait to drive out there again\" good."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and the ribs were to die for! Service was just eh okay. But the food was amazing. The cornbread is a must! Cool atmosphere too! I recommend!"}
{"text":"We went in and they told us it would be a 20 minute wait.  There were literally 20 tables open.  Sat at bar. Had a drink. After 20 minutes we are seated at one of the many open tables within 3 feet of us..   We lol.  Are you serious?? Order an appetizer.and dinner. 30 min later it comes..  food 1 hour later.  Rarely checked on. Finally got served after waiting 90 minutes.  Food was ok and comped 30%..i guess it was a fluke???   It will take a lot to return."}

Great sides , and a great Beer selection . They do get very busy so prepare for a wait at peak times . Can't wait to come back . Staff was great too . Now they just need to open another location in Columbus ;)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best bbq in Northeast Ohio. I've had bbq all over the country and most dishes here are comparable to some of the best I've had! So glad to have something like this in the area."}
{"text":"Since the move to their new location, they got it right!  Everything is tasty- entrees, sandwiches, sides and salads!  Highly recommend for a great BBQ meal out."}
{"text":"Just had the fish fry.  The fish wasn't seasoned at all and the tartar sauce tasted like sour cream with big chunks of dill pickle.  Needs lots of work. Worst fish fry I believe I've ever had.  I've had the pulled pork and it was average."}
{"text":"This is probably out go to restaurant however tonight they were the absolute pits! 0ver an hour and our food had not arrived. The worst was having to endure a surly waitress who really should not be on the floor.  Not one apology, smile, one lie after the other. Her attitude was baaaad."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their chorizo meatloaf, the burnt ends, the brisket, it's all amazing. Their sides are okay.  I don't like the mac and cheese, which has been different every time I've gone. Overall though,  it's a staple in our \"let's go out to dinner tonight\" repertoire."}
{"text":"Most tender, flavorful ribs ever. Everything else I've ever ordered, never been disappointed. Well worth the drive from downtown."}
{"text":"Really a nice restaurant. The reservation was honored promptly. The staff is professional and friendly. The menu has a good selection of interesting items. The orders and beverages came out quickly even though the place was fairly busy. The food was excellently prepared. A great experience and good value."}
{"text":"Had an awesome dinner! This was our first time there and we will definitely be back! Shrimp and grits were the best I've ever tasted...huge portion! The wings were cooked perfectly!!! Nice decor and friendly staff!!!"}
{"text":"Alright, I will admit this review is a long time coming and the pictures don't do the meals justice, but here I am finally putting pen to paper and letting ya'll know about the really tasty BBQ at Oak & Embers! 

This place is a bit out of the way for me, we're talking a good 45 minute drive, but I was meeting up with a small group of friends and the food was great so I would definitely make the drive again!

We started off with the burnt ends appetizer $10.50 which was very tasty! Then 3 of us tried out some of the meat and side options (ranges from $13.50 - $25) while one person tried the shrimp and grits plate $17. I really liked that the meat plates include 2 sides and cornbread. Some places the plate doesn't include a side and/or you get a slice of grocery store white bread. 

All I can remember is that I had enough food for three meals and that I really enjoyed everything except the mashed potatoes. Those tasted like old boxed potatoes that had been sitting in a warmer for too long. I took one bite and traded them for a different side. 

Our waiter was a young friendly kid who joked around with our table. All of the staff we encountered were pleasant. This place is located in a plaza, but that just means they have plenty of parking. I've thought about this place ever since I went and I think a trip back soon is in order! (I'll make sure to take better pictures and write better descriptions of the food!)



***Update
The meat does not melt in your mouth, but it is still pretty good. Cornbread was good but does have a sugar coating on top of it. Baked beans were not my cup of tea at all. Mac & cheese was gooey and cheesy, very good. Dirty grits were tasty as well. Appleslaw was just okay. Big portion sizes."}
{"text":"Great bbq chicken sauce is a tomato base not much flavor. Sides are fantastic great sweet potato fries. Waitress was pleasant. Food came quick and it is very clean. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"Wow. The food here is just incredible. When I got my brisket plate, I was sad about the small amount of bbq sauce but quickly realized that this was not a mistake-the quality of the meat and the rub on the brisket was incredible. Amazing flavors. The sides (Mac and cheese, apple slaw) were both excellent. Husband got the ribs, which were licked clean. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been to the Oak three times and each time it has been delicious!   Their specials are not only inventive and exciting, they are extremely tasty.  My favorite BBQ so far is the pulled pork - yum!   Don't miss the apple cake with bourbon ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try based on the word of mouth and reviews, took a group of 6 after a hike at Orchard Hills Park.  Easy to miss the restaurant, kind of tucked in out of view.  The decor is nice, rustic chic, but sparse.  They got us set up and had no problem with us doing separate checks.  

Everyone was really impressed with the food, there are some serious culinary chops in the kitchen here.  I had the Cajun Groper, a really nice sized fillet, perfectly cooked and topped with a hot spice mix; delicious, but it has a bit of a kick, so be careful.  The sides I tried were all good, with the highlight being the mac and cheese, a nice smooth blend with a nice little smokey flavor.  Portion sizes are generous especially when you consider the prices and the quality.

Save room for desert, we had the cheesecake which was a large cube of dense New York style cheesecake with strawberries and whipped cream.  But the real winner was the special dessert apples and peaches with puff pastry; it came out steaming hot and tasting like the best peach apple pie you could imagine.   

Service overall was good, but we did have a couple of little flubs; the desserts took quite a while to get out, I'm guessing since the special dessert was made fresh from scratch.  Also a cup of coffee came out a bit stale.  Everything else made up for these.  We will be heading back soon.

While the BBQ is very good, there is some other great items on the menu, including some very good fish and seafood.  Also there are some exemplary desserts.  Get there now before they are featured on Food Network and they get incredibly crowded."}
{"text":"LET ME START BY SAYING THE \"CO OWNER\" CHRIS LAID HIS HANDS ON A PATRON AND TOLD MY TABLE TO GO FUCK OURSELVES!! (And that according to the workers this is one of many times this has happened) and you're still in business why/how? 

We journeyed 50 min to try this place for the first time and what a nightmare!! Spent a total of 2 1/2 hours here for what should have taken no more than an hour. Very slow kitchen. 

Our server Anthony couldn't have been more great. Going above and beyond in what is clearly a dysfunctional workplace. We had the \"co owner\" Chris come by to talk about our disappointment and he clearly could not give a crap about us.

We had many encounters with different employees who told us they hate their job, they wish they could walk out, the managers never care about the customers complaints so it's pointless to complain. The \"co owner\" Chris came over one last time to clear our plates and asked how it was? We told him \"good but not worth the wait or drive\". Another person at my table explained that he was in the customer service business and this was no way to treat customers. Chris is cocky, arrogant and can admit no wrong. He ended the conversation with our table by telling us \"go fuck yourself\"! YES, THE \"CO OWNER\" CHRIS TOLD US TO GO FUCK OURSELVES!!  He then put his hands on my friend and pushed him. So only go here if your idea of fun is getting sworn at and manhandled by the \"co owner\".  

P.S. Food also sucks."}
{"text":"Now this is what I love.  BBQ rules!!!  Table of four.  We each got something a little different.  Apps were burnt ends and smoked wings.  Both were outstanding.  For the entrees all of us got some sort of smoked items.  I got the pick 3.  I figured the portions would be a little smaller thinking it was kind of a sampler.  Boy was I wrong!!!  There was so much food, I had to take a good amount home.  

The thing I love the most is that while they sauce up the meat pretty well, the sauce itself flavor wise is not overpowering and lets the meat itself shine.  In my pick 3, I got brisket, pulled pork, and ribs.  All were done very well.  I got the cheddar smashed and mac and cheese for the two sides that come with the pick 3.  The cheddar smashed were good.  Not sure what it is about the mac and cheese, but it wasn't to my liking.  However that certainly wouldn't deter me from coming back as they have a great selection of sides to pick from.  

Service was good.  Waitress was attentive and while the apps took a little while to come out, everything ran very smoothly.  

Definitely a place to go back to over and over again!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a higher rating, but my experience was inconsistent.  The ambiance is upscale bar.  Concrete floor, high tables, nice outdoor seating area.  Bar menu has beers, wines and mixed drinks - the mojito is very good.  For appetizers, the burnt ends are one of the best appetizers I have ever eaten.  Served warm, smoky brisket taste with savory barbecue sauce.  Large amount, enough for up to four people.  But the fried plantain chips were meh.  Not sweet, a little too much breading.  They had gator bites as a special and they were good.  There are entrees, but we ordered the combination of meats with sides - you have a choice of brisket, smoked sausage, pulled pork and chicken.  Portions are very generous.  The brisket was great.  Tender, smoky with their barbecue sauce drizzled over it.  Same with the smoked sausage.  The pulled pork was not at all fatty, and very tasty.  Then there is the chicken.  The menu says \"smoked half chicken.\"  All you get is a thigh and drumstick.  Not half a chicken.  No breast meat.  Big disappointment.  The dirty grits are very good - grits with corn and chorizo and spices mixed in.  The cheesey succotash is not your typical succotash - many more complex vegetables as well as cheese.  The sweet potato fries are good as well.  The special side of the day was a mix of spinach and mushrooms - very well done.  The cornbread side was meh.  Dry, not very flavorful.  Service was good and attentive.  So overall, their high points are pretty high and if their low points were eliminated, this would be one awesome place worth a special trip."}
{"text":"Wings were very good, but the food was lukewarm on arrival. The brisket and pulled pork had been served over Texas toast with corn bread on the side. We ordered the Mac and cheese, mashed potato and veggies between the both of us so we could try a variety. Meat was lean and tasty, but tepid temperature was disappointing."}
{"text":"Being from the south, I'm always on a never ending hunt for finding great barbecue in various areas of the country for comparative reasons.This place was recommended to me by a coworker so I gave it a try. The menu has a good choice of bbq options and if for whatever reason you come to a bbq place and don't want bbq they have other options as well.  This visit I ordered the smoked wings with hot flavor sauce and also shrimp and grits . The smoked wings were perfectly prepared and I highly recommend these with whatever sauce you like best. The actual smoking added a nice touch that cant be replicated with regular fried wings. The shrimp and grits were ok however the flavor was very one sided. The salt seemed to overwhelm the rest of  the dish. I don't think I'd order this item again."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but the staff can be a little slow and unpleasant. I can highly recommend burnt ends, shredded pork tacos, pork scratching nachos, chicken and waffles, apple slaw, fried chicken wraps-all very delicious! Some nights they know they're making more money off of the bar so they can be a little slow serving food."}
{"text":"The bbq scene in the \"Land\" has exploded in the past several years. Gone are the day of tossing ribs in the oven with some open pit, cooking the crap out of them till the meat collapses under its own with and then claiming it's BBQ. BBQ requires some sort of smoking mechanism, usually a dry rub is involved, any may or may not be finished with a sauce. In fact good bbq does not really need a sauce.

Oak and embers is a great example of a quality BBQ joint that does it correctly, in fact it is some of the nest BBQ i have had in the Land.

I, being a strict vegan ordered the pic 3 with ribs, chicken, and brisket. Ribs were awesome,  no need for sauce. Nice Smokey flavor with a little bit of bark. Ahh the brisket, what doTexans and Jews have in common -  brisket. Howard I made the brisket.  ; ) it was excellent as well. Smoked 1/4 chicken,  was also fantastic. My side's were green beans and cauliflower. Green beans were perfect, not canned soggy cafeteria style. Cauliflower had great flavor. Oh and I forgot about the amazing vegan pork rind and queso with chorizo dip. Amazing, It was extremely  awesome to witness one of my family members forbidding her husband to eat pork rinds.

THE only downside was it took a very long time to get our food. The server advised a 50 minute wait for food is normal on a Saturday night. Having worked in the biz  during my raging 20's it's nice to let people know that the kitchen is backed up."}
{"text":"Average at best. Nice and efficient waitress. I ordered the brisket melt, thinking as the menu read, \"brisket stacked high\". The only reason it was stacked high was because it was between two slices of bread that were two inches thick each. To me a \"melt\" is meat ON a piece of bread. The brisket itself was sort of tough, and kind of felt like it was prepared by Sysco. My friend had the meatloaf and said it was OK. His wife said her meal was OK, she had goat cheese and beet salad, and the goat cheese was definitely Sysco ordered large breaded ball, deep fried. My wife had the grouper which she liked...25% success. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Ok so we're passing thru to NY and remember hearing about the smoked meatloaf and my stomach got the best of me so off to Oak n Embers a little out of our way but damn it made up for it for sure we started with the smoked wing with the burbon bbq sauce and it was gone before I could clean my fingers off and take a picture so good I could eat just that and be more than happy so onto the main dish I was going to get the meatloaf but saw it had chorizo and I'm not a fan of it so off to the next choice the two meats. So I choose the brisket and the half slab of ribs so after one piece of brisket and a rib everything started to hit me and I was too stuffed to continue my meal also come with corn bread and two sides first off the dirty grits were so  so I've had much better and the smashed cheddar potatoes were ok but I think they were instant which I'm no fan of but I came for the meats and I'm very satisfied I made the detour"}
{"text":"We went to oak and embers this Sunday, we live near strongsville, figured we'd trek out to chesterland to try this place out. Let me preface this by noting my family and I lived in Kansas City for 11 years and we loooove our bbq. We initially wanted to try out the restaurant as its pretty much, as far as I know, the only bbq place in the area that serves burnt ends--which is a quintessential kc bbq offering. We tried the burnt ends- tender, cooked perfectly, smokey and the sauce was awesome; a little sweet for my taste, but good. (Btw y'all should consider making the burnt ends a meal or offer a pork burnt end option) I got the pulled pork- also tender, fell apart the way it should, massive portion, and the sauce was even better than the one served with the burnt ends. First family member got the beef brisket- she loved it, I had a bite and can attest it was also tender, more lean than expected (not a bad thing). Other family member got the sausage-he said it was really good, flavorful, spicy; but will be sticking to the pulled pork or brisket next time. Our sides were also to die for-the Mac and cheese was good, sometimes when it's out on a menu at a southern style restaurant or bbq place it can taste like an afterthought but this was seriously good Mac and cheese. Cornbread was dope as well. Not to be forgotten, the drink selection is extensive and impressive for someone interested in bourbon. We will be back, we were very happy with our food, the service and the atmosphere. We were surprised to have found an authentic bbq place up in ne Ohio, we've tried a few but nothing had compared to home, but this place did."}
{"text":"It smells like smoke in there so when you leave, expect to wash your hair as well as your clothes. Not traditional bbq - no big deal. Sigh ..."}
{"text":"This is my first review and the first time I felt I should take the time to do so. I will try to keep it short. We arrived yesterday before 6pm and left at 7:30pm when we still had not received our meal. We were told they were slammed by take outs. We told the server that we were leaving and she apologized and then a few moments chased us down to make sure we paid for our drinks, which we left plenty of money to cover them on the table. VERY disappointed, especially because it was our Anniversary and we wasted it there. Btw restaurant was not busy."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool bar with a decent selection of whiskey to choose from. 

The barbeque sauce is just ok, but the burnt ends are hit or miss.  The last time I ordered them they came boiling hot swimming in steaming hot sauce AND under cooked. They just tried to rush a long smoking process by boiling them in some sauce.  I had to wait about 5 min before they were cooled enough to eat.  That's when I found chewy, fatty cuts.  Clearly not slow smoked.

1 star for the food, but the bar gets 3.

Lots of hype here."}
{"text":"The space is cozy and smells like a BBQ joint as soon as you hit the parking lot.  They have an excellent selection of beer, bourbons and mixed drinks.  The burnt ends appetizer was delicious with very crispy plantain chips. The kitchen was backed up on our visit and we waited 45 minutes for our entrees. However, the food was worth the wait. The meatloaf was delicious as were the ribs.  The brisket was a little fatty but good. Overall, it is a must visit place if you like BBQ."}
{"text":"This place is ok, the appetizers here are good, the fried wings are not that crispy, so that's sort of a negative. The positive is they have a good bourbon menu; and plenty of tv's to watch any sports games on. We came with quite a big party and I ordered the brisket and was sorely disappointed; it was a bit sinewy and did not break apart like a properly smoked brisket would. My buddy ordered the chicken and waffles and that was good, and the service here is just ok... This is more of a 2.5 star review, make your wings crispy and definitely fix the brisket and then I will raise my rating to something better."}
{"text":"Visited this place and was SO glad we did! Delicious BBQ and sides. There was also a large bourbon and craft beer menu with plenty of bourbon cocktails and craft beers. The food all seemed to be scratch made. Our table sampled the pork rinds and queso appetizer and the burnt ends appetizer. Both were excellent. I ordered the nightly special which was a pork chop with gnocchi and green beans....VERY, VERY good. I believe everyone at our table enjoyed their food equally. Prices seemed comparable to similar type restaurants. The atmosphere was relaxed and comfortable. While inside, the ambiance is  rustic and perfect. It is clean as are the restrooms. The outside seating is a bit strange being in a strip mall in a rural location. You're basically on the sidewalk overlooking the parking lot. I can't wait to return. Chesterland is lucky to be home to this gem!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for BBQ and headed to the Oak and Embers Tavern.  Well ended up not having bbq because there are so many great items on the menu.  They had a monk fish special that was tasty and the steaks were cooked to perfection and delicious.  Love their whiskey selection and the specialty drinks are great.  Really don't not have a bad thing to say about this place.

The servers are attentive and friendly.  This is definitely a five star place!  Recommend getting here early because they fill up fast."}
{"text":"We love trying out new restaurants. All of my husbands families birthdays are in March, so we decided to try something new. 

The staff was very friendly and helpful. 

We ordered a variety of apps. 
The burnt ends and cheese curds were delicious. We also ordered some drinks. My husband asked for a hotty totty and was given a shot of bourbon and warm water with some tea bags on the side. I actually had to make it for him. 

For my meal. I wanted the meatloaf sandwich. It was actually the platter that was delivered. The meatloaf itself was moist, but, not very good. I took a few bites and took the rest home for my dogs. The mashed potatoes were creamy, but, lacked flavor. 

My husband ordered the pick two. He got chicken and pulled pork. The chicken was delicious. The pulled pork was a bit dry and lacked sauce. We did get several sauces on the side. 

Our server was very nice. Sang praises about her brother who is the chef. All in all. It wasn't quite worth the $250 we spent. 

Unsure if we'll be back."}
{"text":"The bbq was ok. I didn't like the ribs at all. The wings were awesome probably some of the best I've had. Heard so much about the burnt ends and was very disappointed.  Again they were ok. But from what i heard they were supposed to be crispy and melt in your mouth good. My hubby got the smokehouse filet and he said my chuck roast on the grill was better. He loves filet by the way. It was an experience and an adventure.  But I won't drive 70 miles to go the again."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service and excellent food! We loved the cheese curds, baby back ribs, grits, Mac n cheese and baked beans. Big portions of food for a reasonable price. If your looking for good bbq and great service this is your place."}
{"text":"Have tried the bbq pork, bbq sausage and brisket. All awesome. Ribs are ok. Not fall off the bone but good. The grits and the cornbread and the succotash are to die for. The burgers are good too. Soggy fried though. All in a a great place. Only wish the air conditioning worked better. It's really hot in there."}
{"text":"We live on the other side of town, but we were out this way and because of Yelp reviews we stopped in. 

The food was great. We didn't order meals, we ordered appetizers and sides so we could try assorted things. 

We got the Burnt Ends, Black Bean Soup, Cornbread, Fries and Caesar Salad. All of it was delicious. 

My only complaint was the service. Our waitress was very nice, but not very attentive. I had to ask for refills of water and ice tea - and this to me is a simple thing to do to make or break your service to others. 

Definitely would return if we were over this way."}
{"text":"Outstanding experience last night.  Stopped in before local football game for a beer.  We liked the ambiance so much that we decided to come back for dinner after the game.  Staff was very courteous.  Waiter attentive and very polite.  My wife got half chicken and I got the Double which included two meat selections.  I got chicken and brisket.  Awesome.  Highly reccomend."}
{"text":"Thank goodness a friend recommended this place, because from the outside we never would have chosen to go here for dinner. The sign is not very eye catching or appealing. The inside decor is cute- not overdone, cozy, low lighting and comfortable, and the patio is a good size and also comfy. 
Service was decent, and the food was pretty good. Try the mussels appetizer- it has Crostinis with corn, beans, and sausage - very unique to pair with the mussels but very very good!!! 
Their side dishes weren't that outstanding-not horrible just mediocre, but the brisket sandwich I ordered was flavorful- just expect a lot of bread! It reminded me of a sandwich from Melt. 
Their sweet tea tasted strongly of the tea flavor and wasn't overly sweet- very yummy but different! 
Their cocktail and beer list was average size/selection, and they had a good amount of bourbons."}
{"text":"4.5 stars

In the middle of farmland, is a plaza that has a restaurant with great BBQ. Yes, decent BBQ in CLE! Our Texan friend actually recommended that we try this place out. He had just eaten at the restaurant the day before, and recommended that we try it so he could come eat here again (yes AGAIN). Guess it must be good if he's willing to come eat at the same place two days in a row! 

We had a medium sized group so we were able to order more and try different dishes. We started off with the \"burnt ends in Bourbon BBQ sauce,\" oooooh my was that yummy! The fatty meat covered in their delicious sauce just melted in our mouths! We were already impressed just with the starters. 

Next we ordered the main dishes, a full rack of ribs, and pulled pork. Of course we needed sides with all that meat, so we got the \"dirty grits,\" mac n cheese, sweet potato fries, green beans, and cheddar mashed potatoes. The ribs were delicious!! The meat was tender and covered with their delicious BBQ sauce (you can be sure we were lickin' our fingers away while eating)! Our Texan friend kept asking for more BBQ sauce because he loved it so much, unfortunately they came in little sauce cups so multiple requests had to be made. He even asked if they sold their sauce to customers...sorry to say, they haven't started bottling it for sale. Guess you have to take your BBQ sauce shots in the restaurant! ;p

As for the rest of the meal, the pulled pork was also fairly good. The meat was tender and moist, and of course smothered in their yummy BBQ sauce. The best side dish we had was the dirty grits! That is another dish you have to try when you dine here! We all loved it because you could taste the chorizo chunks mixed in with the creamy grits. The rest of the sides were ok, but nothing to rave about. I guess after having the dirty grits, the rest of the sides weren't as appealing. 

By the end of the meal we did major damage, and almost completely finished everything we ordered. We were happy and fat...oops, I mean full! We were happy and ffffull! Anyway, if you're looking for a fat and happy meal, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Excellent barbecue and a pretty good value. The ribs were superbly cooked, great flavor. I'd have preferred less of a less sweet sauce, but I'll go back to eat them whenever I'm in town. The sides, typically a minor afterthought in a barbecue place, were a happy surprise. The cheesy succotash was as un-succoatash like as anything I've ever had, with corn, perfectly cooked zucchini, tomatoes and onions in a light cheesy sauce. The apple slaw was a nice diversion from he more typical cole slaw, and the beans were great. Cornbread was very good, but also sweeter than I might have liked. The meat was the highlight though, the best I've ever had in a place that wasn't a shack by the side of the road. 

They have a number of interesting beers on draft and our service was great--prompt and friendly. We sat outside and aside from they guys gunning their engines in the parking lot and someone smoking a few tables down (do that allow that in Ohio?) it was lovely. Prices were quite reasonable for the food delivered. As noted by another reviewer, the place does seem to have a bit of an identity crisis between sports bar, dance hall, family restaurant, and foodie paradise, but I'm happy to look past that for the delicious ribs."}
{"text":"Excellent food and Excellent Service! This was our first visit and we were not disappointed. We ordered the burnt ends(highly recommed) and the Carolina BBQ wings which were delicious! My husband and I both ordered a trio and I recommend anything on the menu. The cornbread is out of this world!! We cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"When I travel for work, I typically look up the BBQ places where I'm staying. This place has some good reviews so I stopped in. The brisket is very good. No knife necessary. Great sauce as well. I ordered dirty grits and cheesy smashed potatoes as my sides. Both were good, the grits especially. I liked the outdoor seating with a TV to watch the Indians game. 

Service was good. Oh, had the bourbon ice cream which I'd recommend. Another highlight for me was the Guinness on tap. Overall, a great meal and experience."}
{"text":"I'm not a big BBQ fan and don't eat red meat (ok, I occasionally do but it's incredibly rare). So when a friend picked this place for a going away dinner, I figured I would end up with some bland salad and go home starving. I was pleasantly surprised that several items on the menu had my interest and the good beer choices. Interestingly enough, despite the great red meat and pork choices on the menu, everyone ordered seafood. 

I had the salmon and it was outstanding! It had a maple glaze that added a wonderful sweetness but wasn't overpowering enough to take away from the flavor of the salmon. It was served with green beans that were pretty good and cornbread. One friend had the mussels and while they were good they had an overpowering fishy taste that made me think they were frozen. We had the queso dip with pork rinds as an appetizer and it was just okay. Cheese dip from a jar at the grocery store tastes about as good, but the pork rinds were pretty tasty (and this is coming from a girl who doesn't typically eat pork!). My beloved had a shrimp dish that I thought was good but not great (however he devoured it and said it was amazing). 

The thing that disappointed me the most was how many beers they were out of (I really wanted to try the Maple Porter). They were out of several beers that I tried to order. I ended up with a Lefthand Milk Stout, which isn't disappointing at all (but it is a favorite beer of mine and I was sort of wanting to try something new). 

Our waitress was friendly, and did a great job of keeping our waters full and getting new drinks to us before we were empty. The table was a little crowded so I wish we had been sat at a booth or a larger table. The bathrooms weren't dirty by any means but one stall was out of toilet paper and kind of gross. 

In conclusion, I was pleasantly surprised by this place. It looks fairly bland from the outside, existing in a small strip mall. There is a small patio that I want to check out once the weather is a bit better. Definitely give the salmon a shot - it was cooked to perfection and the glaze was amazing. We got some sort of apple dessert thing that was nothing special. None of the desserts were calling my name, and I usually have a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Really tasty! Went here a few weeks ago with the family for a Labor Day meal - at like 11:30am. They were really attentive, the food was great - all kinds of options for non-pork eaters like me. The serving size wasn't too big either. I rather enjoyed the experience.

I had a chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. 

My brother-in-law did have three pieces of cornbread, says it's one of the best. I should have ordered that. :-("}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ. Smoked wings are a staple for us. Brisket and baby back ribs are very good. Best BBQ in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We're not from this area and have recently been a little disappointed with our culinary experiences on the east side, and when our GPS turned us into a little strip mall I was pretty sure Oaks & Embers would follow suit. Boy was I wrong, this joint blew my expectations out of the water! 

The space is a lot larger than I would have imagined from the outside. I'm not sure how to describe it, but the atmosphere is different than what I would have expected from a BBQ joint.

The beer list is definitely decent enough for the area, they have a good enough selection of drafts and bottles. It's not super expansive, but it's more impressive than I expected. It was our waiter Harry's first day on the job and he did excellent and was surprisingly knowledgeable about the menu on some questions we asked that were probably not normal FAQ.

We didn't look anything up about the business before our visit, just picked a place at random really, so we weren't aware it was a BBQ place prior to arriving. Because of dietary restrictions, I can't indulge in BBQ sauce so I was a little worried when I first glanced at the menu. I ordered the Las Maria salad and let me tell you, it's taken my #1 spot for best salad I've ever had at a casual eatery! Everything was very fresh. It comes with pulled smoked chicken on top -- it was so flavorful, tender and moist I had to double check that it didn't have any barbecue on it (there wasn't). 

And ooooh the avocado ranch dressing...let me tell you. This dressing deserves its own paragraph. First off, I'm pretty sure it's made with fresh avocados. It's a real treat. I'm very picky about my ranch dressings, but this one made the cut ten fold. Some day, I'm going to go back and order their pulled pork tacos and smother those bad boys with this stuff. I urge you to do the same. 

Bravo Oaks & Embers, five stars for you."}
{"text":"I had the brisket and my wife had the pork chop.  Mine was excellent, however my wife's was okay.  The server was not very attentive to our table of 8 and then was slow to get us our checks.  Food is very good and will keep me coming back- hopefully the service is better next time."}
{"text":"Wow what a place. Not overly impressed by the decor, but definitely by the food. The selection of house made drinks....awesome! I have gone through almost the whole drink list. The food menu is well put together. Great smokey flavor in the brisket, ribs were good but not great, the fish is great and i love the side dishes. I have visited numerous times and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Great menu and awesome food. Ribs are very good. Cool atmosphere. Plenty of bourbon options. The burnt ends are to die for and so is the cornbread. It's more like a desert."}
{"text":"Now that I have had a chance to try different items from the menu I can now chime in on Oak & Embers.  The super stars of on the menu are the beef brisket and baby back ribs. Both lightly sauced, light smoke and well seasoned.  The baby back ribs are top of the line.  The savory pork comes off the bone with little effort.  The brisket has good bark, is tender and not dry.  I appreciated that our server offered extra sauce on the side.

Not into beef or pork?  Try the chicken and waffle plate.  There's a lot going in terms of flavor and texture.  You have sweet from the maple butter sauce and spicy from the sriracha.  The waffle makes a great vessel for trapping the sauce and eating with the crispy chicken thigh. I'd get this again.

Legitimate barbeque takes a lot of time and care to make right.  I so appreciate them making the ribs fall off the bone and the brisket tender and juicy. The service is not fast food quick and is not expected to be.  The food is fantastic and we are talking BBQ here.  It is so worth it checking it out."}
{"text":"Been looking at the pics of the food on Facebook.  Drove an hour ringer here.  Worth every mile.  Great food, service and beer selection.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Asked for medium burger. Got a raw burger instead after waiting room an hour and a half for food to come out. Been here one other time besides last night about a year ago and it was the same problem will not be back ever again. Cook your food right don't kill your customers..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for BBQ obviously. They have a nice selection of craft beers and bourbon as well. The atmosphere is very casual too. Definitely recommend the cookie for dessert!"}
{"text":"Simply the best BBQ in NE Ohio.  Tried many different items and they were all delicious.  Burnt Ends appetizer was the standout.  Great value for the price.  Big portions coupled with attentive servers made it worth the trip!  Extensive bourbon list. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Bbq in Chesterland! Love the pulled pork soft tacos with crunchy apple slaw on the Starter menu - delicious! Great outdoor patio with TVs for summer sports viewing with a cold beverage!"}
{"text":"The food, service and atmosphere are all above average. As BBQ goes it's actually just above middle of the road, but it has certain dishes that push it beyond mediocre. The pork sandwich is pretty good, though I think their BBQ sauce should be more vinegar based - obviously that's a personal preference. The fried chicken and waffles dish has great flavor, but they use a caramel sauce that sticks to your teeth and detracts from an otherwise 5 star dish. The chorizo meatloaf border lines dry but is overall pretty damn good. The mussels with chorizo appetizer is absolutely five star. Ironically, one of my favorite dishes is not BBQ - the tavern burger with Brie and candied Hungarian peppers is well crafted and unique. 

Overall I love it and it deserves its praise. The beer selection feels like it's trying to be clever without actually being that good  - could be improved."}
{"text":"Had a very good meal at Oak & Embers. Started with an appetizer of burnt ends, and then each of us picked either two or three. Portions were generous, only one minor error was made in the order, and the food came out promptly. Very good experience... we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This hands down was one of my favorite finds that my husband and I have come across while living on the east side. 

When we walked in, we were a little skeptical because of the quite as well as the random group of people. It had everything from old to twenties to families with newborns. Why we thought this was weird we will never know because now we realize it has such a great diversity because the food is something you can't beat.

I ordered the ribs and my mouth drools just thinking about them. I went to pick up a rib and the meat fell off the bone. It was like butter in my mouth, just melting with every bite. 

We cannot wait to go back. It truly is one of our favorite places and we cannot stop talking about it. Defiantly, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Save your money and go somewhere else.

Ill start with the good. First, the decor is awesome. Really nice work with the decorations, a nice bar, great TVs and plenty of room for tables. The high ceilings makes the place feel really big and the smoky smell makes you \"think\" you are in for a great meal. The outdoor patio is pretty nice but the managers clearly didn't test the usage of their WIFI order taking devices as they constantly failed during our order. 

Burnt Ends appetizer
The best thing about this dish was the plantain chips on the side. The burnt ends were not smoky, not crunch and lacked all depth of flavor they should have had. The BBQ was uninspired and pasty. Not the way to start out a meal.

Brisket
Dry and flavorless. We weren't asked if we preferred lean or fatty and I am not sure it would have mattered. 

Smoked Chicken Wings
The wings did have a nice smoke on them. The wings were a nice size. The Whiskey BBQ sauce was pretty good. The wings were served a bit cold. The huge mistake here was not deep frying them after smoking them. The skin was rubbery and useless. I warmed these up the next day in the broiler to get the skin crunchy and their were much better. Cant serve a wing with rubbery chicken.

Smoked Chicken Quarter
Same review here as the wings. Good size portion, good flavor, good smoke. No crunch on the skin. Lazy.

Ribs
The ribs were good. Good smoke flavor, not too much BBQ sauce and the right level of \"bite\" to them. I don't think they had a rub on them though and that left the flavor a little flat. 

Beans
Giant swing and a miss here. The beans were completely out of place. The main flavor profile was Ginger?!? Ginger in a BBQ side dish. Perhaps, it they used less it would have been interesting. What came out was a bowl of PInto beans with undercooked onions and way to much ginger. Awful.


Mac N Cheese
Black specs. What looked like black pepper specs dominated your view of this side dish. I wasnt bothered by it as I assumed it was pepper. My kids wouldnt eat it and everyone commented on it at the table. I thought the mac and cheese was good and I would recommend it as a side.

Cheesy Scucotash
Cool idea! A last minute addition to the order that proved to be one of my favorites there. It was an interesting hybrid of a casserole and succotash and was well liked at the table."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I was nervous to eat at Oak & Embers (BBQ) and was amazed and delighted with the vegetarian options!  

Started with a cup of tomato basil soup - mmmm - with a side of cornbread (which was tasty but not legendary).  For entree I did the fried goat cheese and beet salad.  It had delicious components (beets, candied pecans, fried goat cheese, apples) and my only complaint would be that it was deconstructed.  My eating companion greatly enjoyed his pulled pork tacos.  

The ambiance was fun BBQ inspired vibe, lots of seating, and some TVs if you wanted to catch a game.  Not too busy at lunch either.  Good prices.  I would definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great services! Always a great place to meet up with friends! Food is fabulous! Thanks"}
{"text":"Great food with BBQ flair.  Beautiful bar area and selection of entrees is well worth the money."}
{"text":"Stopped here for the first time to see what all the hype was about. It was awesome and the best meal we've had in a while. I ordered the pulled pork tacos off the small plate menu and thinking that would be a small portion I also ordered the burnt ends. My honey ordered the pick 3 (sausage, ribs and chicken). First of all, the small plate tacos was anything but small. That is way big enough for a full meal and at $9.95 you can't beat it. Delicious also! The burnt ends were also wonderful with plantain chips on the side. Everything on my husband's platter was amazing as well! We will definitely be back. The food and the service were top notch!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is amazing. Nice classy but casual atmosphere. They did a great job expanding the place to include the neighboring place and adding a patio. I had passed by O&E a year ago and finally got a chance to try it last weekend. Good selection of drinks including Kentucky Bourbon ale which is what I had. Appetizer was the special:. queso cheese with beef brisket over tortilla chips --amazing combo of spices, flavor with a generous amount of delicious beef brisket.

My wife and I had the Pick2 combo--great way to sample their meats.  Beef brisket, amazing.  half rack ribs, awesome.  Is there anything this place that isn't delicious?  Cornbread that came with the meal may be just a simple filler at other places but not hear--perhaps the best cornbread I have ever had both in taste and texture.  I thought the apple slaw was only OK--probably just not into the sweet-tartness.  The mac and cheese was very good.  The green beans were also very good.

Across the table, our friend had picked the pulled pork sandwich which looked delicious and was huge.  There was a lot of food, period.  We all got a doggie bag to take home.

Can't wait to return.  This place is amazing!"}
{"text":"Often the second time you go to a restaurant you experience the law of diminishing returns as your expectations exceed the performance. This was not the case for us. We tried many different options and they were all cooked very well. The service was good despite being very crowded. We started with the burnt ends (riblets) and crab cakes, both excellent. We had the filet which was cooked perfectly and tender. We had the bbq chicken, pulled pork, ribs and brisket which are apparently marinated and smoked for 24 hours. We also had the Cajun grouper which was also great. I really loved the sides from scratch, my only problem with the dirty grits and mac and cheese was there wasn't enough of them (although the portion sizes were more than sufficient)."}
{"text":"I'm not from the Chesterland area but was taken out by friends to the Oak and Embers Tavern for dinner.  This quaint little restaurant in a strip mall, from the exterior, looks like nothing out of the ordinary.  From the inside though, it offers a wonderful menu of appetizers, sandwiches and main dishes.  

For my meal I chose the beef brisket, with macaroni and cheese, french fries and cornbread.  The brisket was moist and delicious and the mac and cheese and fries were homemade and fresh.  The most delicious part of the meal was the cornbread.  It was sheer perfection!

The decor was industrial and trendy.  The service was great, with the server making great recommendations and being very personable!

I'd definitely recommend a visit to Oak and Embers Tavern!"}
{"text":"Interesting in that I booked marked this place as I was Yelping before our visit to this area. When we discussed dinner with my father in law, he mentioned this place.

Make sure you call in advance for reservations. But, although they said they were booked for 6:30 on a Friday, when we got there at 7 they were hardly crowded and we got a table right away.

The burnt ends appetizer was delish. We all had 1/2 racks of baby back ribs. Same sauce for the generous portions. The grits were just OK. The beans had thyme in them which hubby didn't like. The apple slaw wasn't appley. The sweet potato fries were the best as somehow the got them crisp. 

We took large doggie boxes of ribs home"}
{"text":"Just OK...had the salmon which was over cooked. The corn bread was way too sweet. My husband had the burnt ends which were pretty fatty. I heard only good things about the place and was very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, always consistent and fairly priced.  Love the cajun grouper."}
{"text":"So the BBQ is a 5, but the sides and location are a 3.

So first, I've been wanting to try this place since it aired on a Michael Symon show awhile back. This place is in a strip mall and is called a tavern. When I walked in I was surprised that there was a bar on the left and then on the right the tables/chairs were very fancy with black linens. It just seemed a bit odd.

I got a class of sweet tea, which wasn't super sweet. I ordered what the show had featured to start with burnt ends with plantain chips. It was very good and the BBQ sauce was tasty. 

For my main dish I got the pulled pork with corn bread, Mac and cheese and cheddar smashed potatoes. Pork was good. Mac and cheese was okay. It was different and kind of tangy. The potatoes left much to be desired. They were mashed, not smashed and I saw no cheddar cheese. 

My guest got the ribs, white cheddar grits and sweet potato fries. Both sides were better than mine.

Overall good, but sides need some work."}
{"text":"Love the food! Service was so so.. She was a new server so couldn't really help much with explaining the menu. I really like the fact that they open very late, since I'm from Ga, I really miss that everything opens so late, compare to most places in Ohio . That being said, I'm very pleased with this restaurant since it reminds me of home a lot . Highly recommend this place for those who love BBQ and likes to eat out late ."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times with my family while visiting and its been consistently good.  The burnt ends appetizer and the smoked chicken wings are where it's at!  Although the rest of the items I've tried on the menu are good as well. The sides are also good, one of my faves is the mac and cheese. 

They have good cocktail, beer and bourbon lists to please just about anyone. 

It's pretty consistently busy each time I'm there but the service is always courteous and as speedy as they can be given how busy they are.  

The atmosphere is rustic but trendy so it transports you a little bit from the strip mall exterior.  It's definitely a local gem!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here last night!  My 10 year old saw the restaurant on the Food network and begged to go try it out.   
The restaurant itself is in an unassuming strip mall, but that means plenty of parking!  
For starters we had the burnt ends, shared by 4 at the table.  My husband ordered the chorizo meatloaf dinner- plenty for two to share (or leftovers), I had the Las Marias salad, tons of pulled chicken on top, my son ordered a burger- 1/2 lb grilled to order with carmelized onions and cheese, my daughter had the popcorn chicken from the kids menu- and my husband grabbed a few pieces of the extra crispy chicken!  
On Monday night they even had a magician- which I'm pretty sure my 29 year old nephew enjoyed as much as the kids.  
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about how good the food is. So we finally went. The service coming out of the kitchen is so slow. Took 40 mins after ordering to get are applitizer.  Then another 45 to get are dinners.  We were not the only table with the issue. Once we got are food it was okay. Not great!    Would we go back....probably not ! Way Way to slow  !!!"}
{"text":"Always busy so you know it's gotta be good!! Went here with a girlfriend and ordered a bottle of wine. The only downside was I couldn't try it first. From there I had the tacos and they were amazing. Service was fast and the prices aren't bad at all! It's always busy so be prepared for a little wait but I promise it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"Very impressive all around. Great food and service both. Lots of good smoke on all meats. Incredible menu with lots of options for everyone. Somewhat pricey but worth it for the quality. Nice beer and spirit options. Sides were incredible. Waitstaff were very friendly and attentive. Only complaint is the main now sauce is in the sweet side. Would have liked a spicier option. The Carolina sauce was very good. Try the Burnt End app!"}
{"text":"Great food! A little out of the way. Everything we tried was good. I like the concrete PIG! Lol"}
{"text":"Came here tonight.  Place was halfway empty and got seated right away.  The food was good but unfortunately it took us an hour and 20 minutes to get our food, another 20 minutes to get our check.  It was so frustrating!  We missed our daughter's band performance while waiting.  The server was pleasant but it was so insane to have to wait that long.  I probably will never come back.  It's unfortunate because the food is good but it's not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great at the bar for food and  service tonight. Lacy did a great job, friendly and always on top of the service. I am very pleased with the service."}
{"text":"Based on all the great reviews, I thought this place would be fabulous. It definitely did not live up to all the hype. I made reservations over a week in advance and specified a table. When we arrived, the hostesses did not even greet us. There were 3 of them standing at the podium talking. I had to interrupt their conversation to say we had reservations. There was no one else waiting. Apparently reserving in advance gets you a high top table on the stage underneath the giant screen tv which was packed with people. We asked to be seated elsewhere, a little less crowded. The hostess got annoyed and said she would have to see if there was anything available. Meanwhile we could see several empty tables to the left. So my husband suggested it. Hostess sighed and said fine. Great we were seated. It only got worse from there. Our server was James. We saw him 4 times - once to take our order after waiting about 15 min, 2nd to deliver appetizer, 3rd to deliver our food, and 4th to give us the check and boxes which we had to ask for. No refills were offered nor were we asked if we wanted another round of drinks. 

As for the food, portion sizes were large but taste not so much. My husband loves BBQ. So we've been to a lot of places. This is the worst by far. I've had better pulled pork at Famous Dave's!!! The burnt ends appetizer was mostly fatty, greasy pieces with bland, tasteless plantain discs. My husband ordered the meatloaf which was supposed to be a combination of chorizo and beef. It was so overwhelmingly chorizo that you could taste nothing else. His cheddar mashed potatoes contained no cheese. He added a side of baked beans which were more onions and other things than beans. I chose the pick 2 combo of pulled pork and sausage link. Both were drowning in the sugar ladden, tomato-based BBQ sauce, you could not taste anything else. Just not good. Apple slaw was good though and so were the white cheddar grits. I would recommend those sides. Both came with sides of cornbread which were very strange with a hard, sugared top. Dry like the desert. Not like any cornbread I've ever had and not in a good way. So from extremely bad service to horrible food, I would suggest dining elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food great service. Lu Lu was our server she was great. Really good BBQ restaurant and more. 
I recommend you try you will not be disappointed.
Drinks are fantastic."}
{"text":"BBQ worth the drive.

This place in an unassuming strip mall (you'll probably miss the first driveway) delivers on expectations.  The hidden location and dated signage makes you nervous at first, but the inside is very modern and very spacious.

We did an early Sunday dinner and were craving something different and not too pretentious.  Alas, we ended up here.  The waitress was friendly, if not a little pushy to get the drinks and meal started.  Regardless, she was efficient and everything turned out just fine.  GF went with the brisket melt (brisket stacked high) and I don't know if we were there on a good day, but it was truly stacked high and more than she could manage.  I went ribs and was amazed by the amount of meat on the ribs, seriously the meatiest I've ever had.  Green beans were delicious too.  Only the cornbread was a little dry, but you get a brick of it so it's quantity over quality there.

Big plus: Arrogant Bastard in a big bottle."}
{"text":"Great little place for BBQ and bourbon. Friendly and efficient staff and good food make it a winner."}
{"text":"We had good service, but slow at times, and we all enjoyed our food. The server was friendly and helpful. Three of us had pulled pork and one of us had ribs, and the portions were generous. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good beer. Excellent BBQ.  Limp fries.  Mac and cheese needs some flavor-maybe some onion.  BBQ sauce a little on the sweet side, but this is the Midwest.  Everything could use a little heat, having lived in the South quite a few years.  Overall, though, good atmosphere and nice waitress.  Will go again."}
{"text":"After the first bite of our Baby Back Ribs,Apple Slaw, Baked Beans and Cornbread--all homemade-- we nodded in agreement!  Yep!  This is our new favorite Barbecue place in NE Ohio!  Service was stellar, too!  The big screens can go---I'd rather not be distracted from the exquisite experience of flavor exploding in my mouth!  I just want to mindfully meditate on the taste!  Mmm Mmm Mmm. And the best news!  The Hudson, Ohio, location opens mid-May on Rt 91 in the old Marcellitas location, halfway between Hudson and Twinsburg!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good and the food is not bad, but not unbelievably awesome or anything. -and believe me you pay  for it too! Ie. 7 roasted asparagus for $5 / this was a special ...
Bar staff is not very friendly and a bit put off."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after a Sunday of golfing. Had been meaning to come here because I'm friends with the family that owns it but it's quite a ways away from where I live.

I ordered the pick 3 with ribs, brisket and half chicken with white cheddar grits, green beans and corn bread.

Everything was fantastic but if I had to pick I'd say the ribs and the grits were my favorite part of the meal. I'll definitely be back to try the burnt ends and pulled pork.

Some of the best bbq I've had in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, service is the worst service I've ever had in my life.  Waitress couldn't have been more rude and she ruined our experience.  Would give the food 5 stars, waitress 0 stars, and hostesses 5 stars.  Promote the hostesses to servers, ours has to go."}
{"text":"This is a tough review for me - if this was a Heavyweight fight it would be a split-decision.  Loved the old farmhouse, cramped but cozy with the smell of the wood burning, but glad to see they are a growing business and moved to a larger space.  The food - Smoked meats are fantastic.  Never had anything bad in my 3 visits.  The sides are all above average with the exception of the Mac n Cheese.  Very bland, no flavor at all, so take a pass on that.  The cornbread is so sweet it could almost pass as dessert.  Here is where my \"split decision\" comes in...

The new location is a confusing mix.  It seems as though it is one of my ex-girlfriends with many personalities.  It has high ceilings, VERY bright lights (i.e. no ambiance) a jukebox blasting, Sports on TV, Modern walls (with nothing on them), reclaimed wood/decorations, and good smokehouse food.  So - Is it a bar?  A modern restaurant?  A smokehouse? A sports bar?  The answer is \"I don't really know\".  The food is good enough to take a date there, but there is no restaurant ambiance.  Or maybe I just don't want to hear the jukebox and college football battle over \"who can be the loudest\" while I am eating.  

I hope that they find their groove and figure out their identity.  The food dictates a good restaurant crowd,  but I would recommend a stop in for yourself to form your own opinion."}
