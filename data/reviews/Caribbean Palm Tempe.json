{"text":"Just ate there they have not been open long food was genuine Caribbean food very good worth a look"}
{"text":"i order delivery food was so delicious jerk chicken with rice & peas and vegetables definitely worth it will be ordering again!!!"}
{"text":"We placed an order for lunch over the phone and when we waited for our food to be cooked.  They told us that they didn't have enough fish for 5 orders of fish tacos and they could either walk to Fry's to get some fish to make us, or spread the fish out for all of the tacos.  So we cancelled one of the fish taco orders and ordered a quesadilla instead.  We opened a box of the fish tacos and there was green mold on the cheese.  We told the lady that there was mold on the cheese and she argued that they don't have mold on their cheese.  The cook apologized for the mold and we asked for our money back.  Please beware of this place.  We will NEVER go back to this place."}
{"text":"The food can take a little bit to come out, but it's totally worth it. Absolutely delicious food and huge portions so it's a good idea to share. We got the jerk chicken pasta which was very sweet and spicy and the braised oxtail which was tender and savory. Highly recommend these dishes and the plantains were delicious as well. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Absolutley wonderful food. My experience was lovely. The service was also very good, and although the food took a while to make it was well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great food! My son and I enjoyed our meals both times we have been here. You get a large portion for the price. The staff is friendly and helpful. Will eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is great, I got the goat she got the jerk chicken and we are going back. It's nice to go into a business and meet the people who are cooking for you."}
{"text":"Such nice staff who was extremely helpful and kind, especially in regards to my allergies. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Authentic Caribbean cuisine in Arizona. If you want to actually taste real Jamaican food then this should be your go to spot, because it taste just like grandmas house back home in Maypen. Big ups to everyone at Caribbean Palm!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Loved the curry chicken, it was perfectly spiced. There was lots of food on the plate. Plantains were the best ever, as were the oxtails. Coconut cake is to die for! We'll be back often to try all the other food on the menu. Their caribbean smoothie hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I had the jerk chicken dinner plate recently and was very impressed. I want to try everything on the menu. I highly recommend this restaurant for lunch or dinner. (They only serve lunch at lunch time and dinner at dinner time, which I liked)"}
{"text":"Great chicken and curry.  I ordered rice and kidney beans to go with it.

Food was brought out hot amd fresh in less than 10 mins."}
{"text":"Pretty decent caribbean food. The spot is pretty bare bones in terms of decor but it works. Had the curry goat, and fried plantains which were good. The entree came with rice, and what I believe is a slaw. Would come back when the craving for caribbean hits!"}
{"text":"You probably shouldn't come here if you're hangry and want food right now, or if you're on a limited time schedule. I came here at lunchtime after getting bubble tea from DaYung's a few doors down. I had a sneaking suspicion I was going to be in for a wait when I glanced over and saw two tables of customers looking like they were impatiently waiting for their food. There was no one at the counter to greet me, and eventually after a few minutes someone emerged through the kitchen door briefly to say that someone would be with me in a minute. Well, a minute rolled by, and another minute, then another... I was actually going to leave and go back home for lunch instead but at the same moment this thought crossed my mind another coworker came out to take my order. OK I thought, I guess this is a sign I should try their food.

The menu has all your favorite Jamaican foods, such as jerk chicken and goat curry. I love the national dish of Jamaica, ackee and saltfish so I try to get it if I'm at new restaurant so that's what I ordered to-go. The total came out to be a little more than $19. A few minutes after I sat down, a customer I had seen from DaYung's walked in and went to one of the tables to sit down with her friends. I overhead her say \"You still haven't gotten your food? I was at the bubble tea shop for a good 20 minutes!\" Hmm.... that doesn't bode well.

So I waited, and waited. I actually ended up writing my entire DaYung's review here because it took so long lol. The other people ahead of me waited and waited. Eventually orders came out, and the gentleman that delivered them to the tables was very apologetic. He said to the first table that the kitchen only had 4 burners and it was hard for them to handle large orders. Hm if you can't handle two 4-person tables (A \"large\" order?) on a regular slow lunch day how will you manage it if the restaurant is full? I'm hoping they are just working out some kinks in prep and cooking because they are still new at this location, but I do know they have an original location in Scottsdale, so shouldn't they know better?

After at least 40 minutes my order was finally ready. Alright! It was a pretty hefty feeling Styrofoam container so I was excited to take my long awaited Jamaican prize back home. The dish consisted of a gigantic portion of rice and beans, with smaller portions of cabbage and the ackee with saltfish. While I liked the rice+beans and the cabbage, unfortunately I didn't really enjoy the ackee and saltfish. I don't think the saltfish was soaked or rinsed for long enough to remove enough of the salt preservative because it was super super salty. There was also an overwhelming acidic tomatoey taste which drowned out the creamy delicate flavor of the ackee. In addition, while I appreciate that they use fresh herbs in their food, they cut the whole stems into what they are cooking instead of just stripping the leaves so when I took bites of my meal I'd occasionally get a hard stem. Not good eats.

I was going to give them another chance but when looking through the photos submitted by the restaurant I noticed they used one of my photos from the Scottsdale location and posted it without my permission or with any recognition for the original source. In the writing world this is called PLAIGIARISM. It's not a professional photo or anything so I'm weirded out by the whole experience. No thanks I'll stick to the other restaurants in this plaza then."}
