{"text":"Awesome service. We came in at 11:30 pm on a Monday night. The staff was extremely attentive. Never felt rushed. Most restaurants focus on closing when it is slow. These guys rocked. Very attentive. We never felt rushed. Our server/barkeep (I regret I didn't write her name down for this review) was outstanding...AND Food was great!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service (Evan and manager), great food, upscale, casual environment that makes for a great night."}
{"text":"I gave this review a 3 stars simply because everything was just \"ok to good.\" The food was good, but not overwhelmingly so. The service was ok (water glasses sat empty 3-4 different times during the meal). I would likely not come back as there are various other options in the city; however, I wouldn't deter anyone from trying it at least once.   Maybe a different location would prove to be  above average...."}
{"text":"Well, I didnt' want to pay for a $60 steak and that was my fault.  But for $40, I could have cooked a better steak.  The twice baked potato and service made up for the mediocre steak."}
{"text":"Lort på dåse ..."}
{"text":"Food is great but don't be in a rush at lunch time to get back to work! Service a bit slow."}
{"text":"The Keg was a great experience. The waitresses double-team to make sure you aren't waiting to be served. Yes, it is pricy, but that doesn't matter when it comes to fine dining. The cooks really know how to prepare a steak...no explaining needed. Also, the lobster w/bacon was awesome. We will be back again!!!!"}
{"text":"Always reliable.  Best steak quality at reasonable price anywhere. Service is usually very good."}
{"text":"rund 15 Minuten Wartezeit - schliesslich war ja auch Freitag Abend und Thanksgiving-Weekend. Es hat sich gelohnt - wir bekamen einen ruhigen Tisch - nicht selbstverständlich in diesem grossen lokal. Das Essen war wie gewohnt sehr gut."}
{"text":"Shannon at the outside bar is our favourite.  She is friendly and always remembers her regulars.  We are closer to the one on King but we will continue to go to this location because of her and the beautiful outdoor dining. The lobster is also a hit!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a chain, my colleagues and i had salads (different ones) and they were pretty decent. Service was ok but the only thing i didn't understand was why they put 5 of us in those terribly small round booths. We literally were elbowing each other."}
{"text":"Steak combo was grilled to perfection. Fantastic service. Cold beer and great atmosphere. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere inside and outside on the patio. Cool vibes, outstanding service, very friendly staff, mixed crowd, casual or dressy, cool bar area with Tvs, and most importantly, the food was amazing. I had the Baseball top sirloin and it was flavorful, and cooked just the way I wanted it. My friend had the pistachio crusted salmon and he said it was outstanding. It too was cooked perfectly and there was the right amount of crunch and the dish was a reasonable size portion. Overall this restaurant is perfect for anyone looking to have a great meal."}
{"text":"Blackened sirloin was cooked to perfection, but the garlic mashed potatoes stole the show. Dark, brooding atmosphere/decor, but the service was anything but..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited this location for the first time today. From the moment we arrived in the foyer and the friendly hostess took our jackets until the time we left it was an overall excellent experience. Food was amazing as always. The service is above par, we even had the manager come over to make sure we enjoyed our meal as I was too full to finish my steak. We will be back."}
{"text":"I live in Washington, DC and was visiting Toronto for a long weekend. My fiance and I decided to grab a nice dinner the evening we arrived (Thursday) and we were pleasantly surprised by the great food and service Keg provided.   The staff was very accommodating, friendly, and quite professional. For example, during dinner, there were a few times when my fiance and I were in the midst of a conversation and as I saw the waitress approach to check on us, she noticed we were talking and she chose to come back a few moments later. I know it's a small detail, but it's those small details that make for a great experience.   As for the food... the steak was great. We each ordered the fillet and they came out perfectly cooked (mine med-rare - my finance's med). You could clearly see and taste the difference between the two and it was well worth the price! The drinks we good as well - strong but not over powering.  While I do acknowledge the comments other reviewers have written about the \"regulars\" in this place, I really feel that the ambiance and food outweigh those negatives.  All in all, next time I'm up in Toronto, I'm coming back to Keg for another fillet!"}
{"text":"Service good. Steak perfect. Unfortunately Found sands in salad, still after change. What happened in the kitchen?"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of The Keg. Went back here for my hubby's birthday and we managed to swindle a table for 5 on the front patio at peak after-work-hours (we had friends head over earlier). The back patio was RIDICULOUSLY packed, so that wasn't even an option, however, that was where we ideally wanted to be. After seeing the madness both inside (which was freezing due to the blasting A/C), and the craziness out back, we were REALLY happy with the front patio score. We could actually hear each other speaking and we got people-watching traffic.  As per usual, and per Keg style, the customer service was excellent, and all our food was awesome. Only reason I don't give The Keg five stars is because there's usually a case of \"I ordered medium-rare and this is rare\" or some sort of slight mix-up with the cooked-to-your-liking choice, and have had overly-sinewy cuts before. It's not a huge deal, but it is a steak house. And you do pride yourself on being able to cook it to perfection. Staff has always done something to ensure I left happy (a free slice, on the house meal, etc.). The GMs are really good at what they do and it shows in the staff's performance too.  Last night's meal, for me, was perfection. Pecan, goat cheese, sirloin. Cooked Chicago-style-medium-well. Normally, I wouldn't get it so done, but I'm pregnant and want it cooked.   I would always recommend The Keg if anyone would ask if they should go."}
{"text":"The Keg on York Street is absolute perfection! I have gone here multiple times and have yet to be disappointed. Food is always amazing (steaks are cooked exactly as you want everytime)  accompanied by friendly/attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"Location - Good  Food - Good  Service - Okay Drinks - Good Atmosphere - Good Clean Restaurant - Okay  Come Back Again - Yes ( with reservations of course )"}
{"text":"From Dallas, TX here on business.. this place was sooo awesome visited twice in one week.. both has times had the T-bone med-rare (perfect).. -steaks are thee best -bake potato amd asparagus was steamed good -ceaser salad good (they have two sizes) -service is very friendly, they attended to you in a blink of an eye, very impressed -they are fast on picking up plates when finish  -have a very great atmosphere here, lights are dim just right, great to take a date to impress -recommened to make reservation or possible wait longer.. -recommened to sit in bar area where fireplace is at.."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The place is romantic, classy and comfortable. I really enjoyed my dinner there. The service was just perfect. It's a nice place to go for a special occasion or on a date. I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"We spend new year eve last year and the ambience was great for the countdown and the food as well."}
{"text":"We are regulars of the keg, we love it but tonight was the worst ever service we ever had. The server was rude, rushing and completely inappropriate with us and even her manager. Her manager even sent us a desert to compensate for the horrible service we received tonight. We were a party of 7, the restaurant was not busy but the women serving us needs to leave the restaurant business. She will hurt this keg location and gives a bad rap to the keg. Not sure what her name was but odly enough she was an older server that we are used to see at the keg. Stay away at all cost. The manager saved the day and should be commended for her patience with that staff. This server even disrespected her manager in front of her..."}
{"text":"The keg burger was amazing and I am astonished at how comfortable the place was!  Really was too pricey, 25 bucks for a huge burger and a full ceased salad, with chicken!!"}
{"text":"I stayed in Toronto for a few days and was looking for a good steak restaurant - The Keg was a perfect choice! I had the Top Sirloin with an atlantic lobster tail and the roasted garlic mashed potato as a side - the food was amazing and I´ve rarely eaten such exceptional meat! The service was great and we were well taken care of - the staff is really nice and welcoming! I´ll definitely check out some other Keg restaurants and if I´m back in Toronto, I´ll eat there again!"}
{"text":"Heerlijke steak (top sirloin) en crême brulee gegeten voor een (in vergelijking met andere restaurants) zeer betaalbare prijs."}
{"text":"This location of the Keg used to be the spot to be. However, with so many more restaurants in the area, its popularity has fallen.  I was there two weeks ago, and both the service and food were excellent.  However, I returned Friday night at around 7:15 p.m., and service was literally non-existent. We sat on the patio at a high top table just outside the door. It was busy on the patio but not packed.   After 20 minutes, no one came to our table, so we got drinks from the bar.   After more than one full hour, no one had still come to our table. We were looking forward to a nice steak dinner. However, due to the lack of service, we decided to leave and have a steak elsewhere.   I am not going to totally write off this Keg location because I have had many great experiences there over the years. I am hoping that this was just a one-off bad experience."}
{"text":"Went with a group with work and was a good experience. Wide range on the menu, very flexible with timing, and friendly waitstaff."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on our first rainy day in Toronto, a Tuesday evening.  It was absolutely divine!  From the bread that was delivered (twice) nice and hot to the excellent service we had from our waiter, everything was 5 Stars.  Except for my daughter who had a delicious bowl of chowder, the rest of us had sirloin steak.  Each steak was cooked to perfection and was tender and juicy.  I must say that I wish I'd gotten our waiter's name because he was attentive without being annoying and that alone made this one of our best memories of our first visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"One of my faves.....great atmosphere, food and service.  Had my first date with hubby there and of course fell in love :)"}
{"text":"It has to be a tie between this location and the one in Vaughan. They are equally amazing.  I love celebrating special occasions at the Keg. They make you feel special and welcomed. The complimentary dessert and cute card is also appreciated.   Steak here is always delicious, the one time I tried the Teriyaki Steak and didn't love it they made me a good ol' plain steak for me! The bread at the start is amazing, and they have an extensive wine list. And don't even get me started on the garlic mash potatoes... OUT OF THIS WORLD.   My only complaint is that not all wines are available by the glass. But everything else is A+"}
{"text":"Great environment, courteous staff! Perfect steak. Made sure our table was intimate, and even brought a comp. Mocha BD Slice of ice cream cake. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot in downtown Toronto.  Nothing too crazy on the menu, steaks, salads, and fish.  The complimentary bread was hot and delish and my Caesar salad was solid.  The prime rib was a little over cooked but the horseradish that came worth made up for it.  The side of vegetable and rice were also quite boring but just what I wanted."}
{"text":"Ish is about to get wordy, y'all.  Here's the situation: Mother, Father, Aunt, Uncle are visiting from Nova Scotia, staying at the Sheraton. Walkable dinner location for a meat & potatoes group? Pretty obvious. We head to The Keg at 8pm.  Waiting area is crammed - but it's a Friday night. Of course. Lady hands me a spaceship beeper and we're lucky to score a just-abandoned table in the bar.  Then things got a little awkward. 2002 R&B blasting on the speakers, loud financial young bucks talking loudly in our peripherals. Not the ideal scene for a group of 50+ maritimers who unironically enjoy truck stop dining (which, as an aside, I also happen to enjoy A LOT). However, once some cocktails started flowing, everyone got comfortable and perhaps I even saw some head-nodding to the beats, Auntie Cynde?   Anyway. Fast-forward 45 minutes later and we still haven't been seated. No biggie, but I went to ask for an ETA on our table. The hostess apologized and said it shouldn't be much longer. Minutes later, Mr. Manager himself came to apologize - insisted that he was working on getting us a table asap, and PLEASE, will we have some appetizers while we wait? He even kneeled down to our eye level. Real this-guy-knows-how-to-be-a-Manager type stuff.  They whisked us off to a table and almost immediately filled our faces with apps (1 more than we ordered). From then, things were unbelievable. Our waitress was perfect - just chatty enough and checked in on us with just the right frequency. Mr. Manager would ensure everything was perfect, even checking with the kitchen that the prime rib was to my Dad's \"blue rare\" liking. (*shudder*) Just wonderful, wonderful service.  See, it warmed the cockles of my heart that The Keg staff are so accommodating - we didn't even mind sitting at the bar for 45 minutes, but they did everything in their power to make the rest of our evening run seamlessly. It seems that in many cases, people get that kind of treatment when they complain, but to know that they still take care of the easy-going folk is brilliant.   (Minus one star for the King street crowd - when it comes to atmosphere, I mos def prefer the Mansion!)"}
{"text":"I'm sorry that I'm super harsh with these ratings but the food at this place is terrible. I mean, the best thing about my experience here was my good looking waiter. I ordered a chicken breast that came with shrimp, scallops and veggies. SUPER SALTY! The veggies were very undercooked, and the seafood just sucked. One thing I've learned about steakhouses is that if you order something other than steak, prepare to be dissapointed. Steakhouses only care about the steak. I really wanted to like this place especially since it was for my anniversary. My boyfriend on the other hand loved his steak but I sampled it and it could've been seasoned way more, that's for sure. The atmosphere was very nice, and intimate, definitely nice for a date but they need to improve their non-steak menu. That's all."}
{"text":"Perfect service. Small selection of appetizers. The steak has a lot of spices on it but was still good"}
{"text":"Fantastic Sirloin and service. I had a great night with my co-workers.  A delicious cheesecake for dessert."}
{"text":"We are staying at a hotel nearby so my wife and son and I ate her twice here in the last two days. We had dietary restrictions that the manager came out to discuss with us personally at our table. She was very professional and took care of us. On our second visit, there was a mixup in the kitchen and they made the food with dairy so they had to start over. This delayed our food which we had to take to go. For our troubles the manager took care of our bill. We made sure to leave a good tip as our server was very attentive.  Regardless of the food error, the service was again excellent and we were very happy with our visit."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night at 8ish, hoping that there would be less people there. Just like any other keg, it was packed, and we waited almost 45 mins to be seated. The area was very dim and it sets the mood for a romantic night out.    I opted for my favorite filet mignon and ordered a Forbidden Fruit martini. The drink was really good; I especially liked the strawberry rock crystals along the rim on the drink. I would recommend this drink for girls, even those who do not regularly drink alcohol because the taste of vodka is barely there.   Onto the filet mignon. I asked for medium rare, but when it came, it was more on the rare side. What's special about the steak was that it was wrapped by a piece of bacon. However, I prefer the steak on its own. The taste of the bacon took over, so halfway through the meal, I separated the two. The steak on its own was very juicy and soft.   Just a tip - the roasted garlic mashed potato side is MASSIVE. Compared to the twice baked potato, the portion is almost double the size! So.. finish your steak before your side.  The service, like any other Keg, was great. The waiter was friendly and attentive.   All in all, it was a good experience, but nothing out of my expectations. I wish the wait could be a little shorter and will probably make reservations the next time I come."}
{"text":"The food was spot on. Nice thick cut steak - baseball sirloin with a twice baked potato. The seasoning on the steak was just right.   The service here is lacking. It took about 5min to be even acknowledged. After my order was placed, not one word was said to me until I asked for my check. I guess I'm a service snob but this is what keeps customers away."}
{"text":"The food is fine.  The people at the door, so-called hostesses, are rude.  We had to complain to the manager.  Will never return."}
{"text":"I hope I'm reviewing the right one.  We went to the one around the corner from the Hilton on Richmond.  We stopped in for a drink and that morphed into a late dinner.  I had the Steak Oscar which was pretty nice.  The bar side of the restaurant was hip and happening.  It was also very popular and got crowded later on, but not in a bad way."}
{"text":"Attentive staff, great food, great patio. Definitely a favorite! I'm a regular here and have been for over 4 years. The staff go out of their way to get to know you and take care of you. This has been consistent year over year. Credit goes to the management of this Keg in that they keep hiring excellent staff! The steaks are consistently great. Anytime anything is wrong, you are taken care of HUGE! Wine list if reasonable and beers on tap are good. Not much to not like which is why it is busy year in year out!"}
{"text":"I didn't feel like a steak so I had their salad with seafood. A few hours later I was ill. Other than toast for breakfast it was all I had that day, so I know what made me sick. I guess one should stick with the steak."}
{"text":"I dropped into the Keg for a couple of hours pre-Easter week-end for some drinks and food with friends. Let me first start off by saying that I have always been a fan of the Keg because in my opinion it is very god quality at its price point, especially in a city with many very high end steak houses.  I will start either drinks....as I did when I actually got there. If you have read any if my other reviews, you know that I am a fan of classic cocktails. I ordered a Negroni to start, as suggested by one of my fave peeps from Chase who was joining us. It was very good in terms of balance. Sometimes I find that it is easy to water down or add some filler to a Negroni, but such was not the case here.  Next I ordered an Old Fashioned.  It was ok, but frankly I think that there might have been some vanilla bitters added, because it had a strong taste to it that was unusual.  For good since there were a few of us, we ordered and shared.  I tried the sliders, the bacon wrapped scallops, and the tuna tacos. I have to say, all 3 were excellent and again reasonably priced! I will definitely be coming back here more regularly as the weather warms up because there is a decent sized patio to enjoy as well!"}
{"text":"Meal was excellent! Steak was cooked to perfection. Side of mashed and veggies tasted great. Was able to taste the wine when deciding between 2 bottles. Mini dessert was the perfect size and fairly priced. Service was friendly and ambiance of the restaurant was great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time ! Great customer service the servers name was DAN and Jeremy ! Came out for the weekend to celebrate a friends birthday. The food was amazing 10 out of 10! We had steak and dan was able to explain each item on the menu in depth and was very patient! I also recommend the sangria we went on a Saturday night August 2,2014"}
{"text":"This place is very professional. Interior is very nice with fireplace, dim lighting and plenty of seating with modern furniture. Waiters/waitresses are very courteous and knowledgeable of the food. Food came quick and was extremely tasty. Definitely a good meeting or date spot!"}
{"text":"Going to the keg was certainly a good time. The place is very well priced! And the food and drinks were both tasty! I got the steak and lobster and I was very pleased with the food. I got the steak medium rare and it was definitely cooked to perfection. My only criticism with the food is that the portion sizes were very small! I'm a New Yorker so I'm used to dining at steakhouses and the portion sizes are never something to complain about. Typically after visiting a steakhouse I will be in a food coma for hours, but after dinner at the keg I was hungry shortly after. The portion size could be a reflection of the price, which is understandable but that is the only negative for me. All in all I would go to The keg again, but I would temper my expectations a bit."}
{"text":"Talk about a meat market.... oh yeah, this place has steaks too.  Thursday -- time to celebrate the almost-weekend!  Hint: Book a meeting in your calendar so you can duck out  of work discreetly...  then run to grab an empty table! Or to reserve your standing space at the bar.  I can't comment on the decor because all I saw were suits. A gigantic crowd of suits...which can be fun, depending on your scene.  Anyways, the Keg is the happening place for an after work drink. Appetizers are always good. The menu is extensive and you can't go wrong with nachos and calamari.  I enjoy dinners at the Keg, but I've never felt this location was actually for dining, more like hanging out, getting your drink on, and trying not to lose your Blackberry."}
{"text":"Thanks to Andrew for the prompt, friendly and accommodating service. We were a group of 40 people who showed up with only about an hour of warning. Didn't seem like a large group was a challenge for the staff at The Keg on York - very swift service. And the food was pretty darn good too. I recommend the Korean Fried Cauliflower very much... and the Baked Garlic Shrimp (*droooolll*) The filet mignon was great, but then its filet mignon. The veggies could have used more seasoning and overall it felt like our food had sat under the heat lamps for a bit too long (dried up the potato, slightly over cooked steak and extremely hot plates). But that didn't affect us much - we enjoyed the company of beautiful people in a lovely environment, with good wine, tasty food and excellent service. Thank you Keg for a great final evening in Toronto. Will see you at one of your Vancouver locations back home"}
{"text":"Was in Ontario visiting friends and was treated to dinner here.  Just as an aside, we had the most gorgeous server that was a big distraction.  She was as friendly and as cordial and efficient as she was beautiful but she had mesmerizing good looks.  Okay, on to the review.  We dined outside and that was comfortable and clean.  Service was prompt and, as stated, efficient and cordial.  The menu was adequate but the prices were high.  Our server suggested a wine and I ordered it (she could have suggested motor oil).  It was quite good and complimented the meal.  The bread was good, with a nice crust.  I had the steak and shrimp.  The steak was decent, although cooked a little more than I like it.  It was more medium than medium rare.  The tiger shrimp was just slightly overcooked.  The accompanying vegetables were a half of a red pepper and a stalk of asparagus.  The baked potato with the works was nothing special.  I have had equal or better food at some of the chains in the States (Texas Roadhouse, for example).  The dining experience was saved by being with friends, a new-to-me city, and the aforementioned drop-dead-gorgeous server.  Otherwise, it was just average food at above average prices."}
{"text":"I'll be the first to tell you that I always get annoyed when people mention The Keg in the same breath as a high-end steakhouse like Harbour Sixty, or even fellow chain steakhouse Ruth's Chris. They're two very different experiences - you're paying for all the little touches when you go high-end. The Keg is the sort of place you go when you want that \"upscale\" dining experience at a more reasonable price point.  That's not to say that The Keg is bad. Far from it. This location, right in the heart of the Financial District, has style for days and offers quick, attentive service and consistent food.  \"Consistency\" is the mark of any good restaurant, and I saw it again when I visited three weeks back. My friends and I were in the city looking to hit up a restaurant after a Jays game and settled on Keg. A long walk and a couple of false starts later, we finally arrived at our destination and were promptly seated.  The York Street location reminds me a lot of TOCA over at the Ritz-Carlton - the ultra-modern, ritzy restaurant/patio that was designed around sharp edges and minimal profiles. We were a bit underdressed for the occasion (sporting more casual fare while women in low-cut miniskirts sidled up to the suited crowd at the bar), but the service was very attentive.  You can tell when someone understands good service, and our waitress had that mindset in spades, almost at a worker bee mentality. Constantly hovering around, refilling water and telling us a bit of history about the site itself, her comments lent themselves well to the atmosphere and quality of the experience.  I had eaten prior to arriving, so I ended up settling for a B-52 coffee and a slice of cheesecake. There wasn't much to the coffee and the cheesecake tasted somewhat unnaturally soft, but I enjoyed what I had overall. (Not so much afterward - the food went through me like a freight train and I had an uncomfortable experience afterwards.)  My friends all ended up going for the classics menu, ranging from the top sirloin to the prime rib, and they all reported that it was great across the board. Like I said, the staff certainly aim to be consistent in their presentation and taste, and they nailed it across the board.  I enjoyed the experience overall and will likely be back in the future. The York Street area is a nexus of great restaurant options, and I feel that this Keg location is a standout amidst all the hustle and bustle."}
{"text":"We had an extra large group come here for a special department lunch. While I was not impressed to find out they really wanted us to book it for 11 AM (who eats at 11?) in the end, it made up for the fact that we were treated so well when we got there. Spectacular seating area that worked for our group, with a quaint fireplace. Service was fantastic, servers were super attentive.   The prime rib was excellent. I meant to take half home but ended up devouring it all.   I definitely will return, with both large groups and a more casual outing."}
{"text":"For my second trip to Toronto for a tradeshow I ended up staying at the same hotel (Sheraton Toronto) and eating at one of the same restaurants .... the Keg Steakhouse!  Food: Good Ambiance: Good Value: Umm, I wasn't paying! :o) Location: Conveniently near the Sheraton Toronto Centre Service: Good  Although I'm not a big steak lover I've come to embrace meat when eating in a group while on business travel. At first I stuck steadfast to salmon at steak restaurants, but recently I've come to order red meat. Hey, when in Rome.. you know.  The restaurant is huge and this year and last year it seems that our group was seated almost immediately. The service was good and the salad was good as well. I liked the steak but didn't love it (I never do), and I'd totally be up for eating here again.   We all had good wine, good steaks, and shared a number of deserts. I didn't hear one complaint from my party of four.   If you're in the area looking for a steak, try the Keg out. And if you don't want a steak, you're in good luck! This steak restaurant had the largest selection of non-steak entrees I can remember ever seeing at a \"steak place\".  It almost swayed me to try the halibut! But in the end, dead cow it was. And it was yummy!"}
{"text":"We started with the tuna tartare and escargot. The escargot was pretty good, but the tuna tartare was just average. I had the filet mignon with the twice baked potato. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly and the bearnaise sauce was delicious. Twice baked potato wasn't as good as the homemade ones my mom makes!"}
{"text":"This place was so busy and bustling with all the after work city folk winding down. We had a 25min wait for a table of 4 and had good service. Food was good if a bit pricey, the lobster comes with a little butter sauce cooking in its own candle warmer. Ask for the specials if not offered, had the cod fish but it was just overcooked a little but still nice overall. Our waiter also came with the complimentary refills of soft drink without being asked - thanks Lewis from Spain :)"}
{"text":"The food was expensive but the quality was good. We all had steaks and everyone loved their steak. One of my friends spilled red wine all over his meal, the manager was able to replace the meal free of charge and no questions asked. They gave us complimentary shrimp cocktail because we were guests at fairmont hotel."}
{"text":"This place is urban upscale but with a laid back friendly bustling atmosphere, we walked in with no reservation went to the bar and proceeded to talk to a passing by hostess who promptly got us a table when asked. No waiting!!! My girlfriend and I both ordered the prime rib and this was by far the best we have EVER had. The wine was good the service was also attentive to everything and she got a nice tip for her trouble. A truly wonderful night with a woman I truly love!"}
{"text":"love love love this chain! New york cant compare with it comes to this great chain. (sorry my fellow new yorkers) Don't get me wrong NY has GREAT steaks! but.... This place along with other great restaurants can make me want to become Canadian a. Their steaks are consistent, and their staff is friendly.  Come with an appetite ppl this place is not for small stomachs. :-)"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Excellent Service Wonderful Seafood. Cant wait to return."}
{"text":"Took a short, brisk walk over from the arena after the Raptors v Celtics game. It was pretty busy so we were pleasantly surprised to find there was no wait. Very warm, welcoming and trendy atmosphere. Although it was late, my fiancé and I tried to have a light mean but ended up going for the gusto! I have the Cesar salad which was good. My fiancé had the wedge salad, he liked it but wished the dressing wasn't as thick. We then moved on to French fries (my go to when I'm unsure) and sliders. My fiancé loved the sliders. Let's talk about these French fries...we decided they were probably the best we have ever tasted! They were crispy but not burned, not oily and the ketchup was just spectacular. We ordered the small brownie dessert which is perfect if you just want something to satisfy your sweet tooth. Very impressed with the atmosphere, decor, service and food."}
{"text":"I love this keg location! They have more items on the menu compared to other kegs. I always leave feeling full ans satisfied with my meal. The servers do a great  job of making sure you're taken care of."}
{"text":"I am basing this review SOLELY on the service I received when I went to pick up a gift card for a client.  Yesterday I visited this location in hopes that I could duck in, grab a gift card, and duck out all in the span of 5 minutes. Yeeeeeah.... so not the case.  I went to the front and asked to purchase a gift card. Not just *any* gift card, but one valuing $250. That's definitely not chump change, so I was ready to get served in serious style. The 3 people at the front smiled and just asked me to wait a few moments. Now a few, that's like 3-5ish right? Uh... try 25. Not kidding. I waited, I waited and I waited. It's not like this was a hard sale either - woman gives you $250, you give her a card in return. No extended service required... so what the problem is?  The girl at the front first called one manager who was apparently 'too busy' to help me, so then 25 minutes later, another manager came around the corner with my gift card. 20 minutes in, I almost marched out but lucky for them, I didn't have a backup plan for a gift idea.  Overall, a very disappointing experience. If this is how they help a customer who doesn't require service beyond \"please sign here for your gift card\", then imagine how the service would be if I was actually sitting at a table and dining with friends.   It's safe to say that my 'should have been brief but really wasn't' experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I've really got no reason to give these guys another go."}
{"text":"Best Keg steakhouse in the city, it'll never blow your mind but it's a consistent decent quality in a nice venue."}
{"text":"Took my mother here for dinner tonight without a reservation and they were able to find a nice booth for us. They found out it was her birthday and treated her like a queen. Even gave her a Billy Miner pie on the house for desert. She loved it.  I frequently go to three Kegs in Toronto - this one, mansion and esplanade. The steaks are usually good at all of them, but this location offers the best, most consistent service hands down. The hostesses, waitresses and servers are always wonderful."}
{"text":"Three stars because my prime rib had far too much pepper on it, should have sent it back.  Great service, with friendly and attentive staff.  Walked in with a party of 6 on a Saturday night at 8pm and sat right down, no reservation.  Good table spacing but warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"This location is our company haunt.   Whenever we have execs visiting from the US we make a big fuss deciding on where to go and ultimately end up here.   Which I don't mind!  There's something to be said for delivering a good meal and service on a consistent basis."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate 3 years with my girlfriend. It helped that we had $100 gift card from Christmas.   We had two cocktails ( mine was lemonade and ginnish) and escargot to start. I liked the way the snails were done. It was almost a curry that was put on the mushroom caps. Quite tasty, even if I'm not the biggest fan of the texture of the snails.   For mains I had a herbed sirlone and my girlfriend got the prime rib. Hers was a bit underdone so she sent it back. The staff was very prompt in sending it back and the service was generally very good.   I'm not a huge fan of chains but this Keg is decent."}
{"text":"I went to a conference in Toronto the week before last, and had two back-to-back steakhouse dinners, which seemed like a very conferencey thing to do. The first one was at The Keg, a safe Yelp-approved option within a short walk of our hotel in the Financial District. I went with three lady friends, and it was a pretty good choice for an easy group dinner: a mini-chain restaurant with sufficient charm and ambiance, where there was guaranteed to be something for everyone.  We had a six o'clock reservation, and I think we probably needed it. The place was huge in the way only chain steakhouses and Cheesecake Factories tend to be huge, but it was busy too, full of people looking for steak on a Thursday evening. I'm guessing The Keg serves a lot of business dinners. It felt a lot like a Capital Grille, a polished, sit-down place designed for deal-making over steaks and a bottle of wine. We weren't conducting any business here, but we had a good time, too. I enjoyed the slightly formal but convivial steakhouse atmosphere. I also enjoyed an excellent Manhattan and my share of a bottle of pinot noir.  The food was quite good. Inspired, perhaps, by the steep calorie counts on the menu (a plus or a minus of Ontario chain restaurants, depending on your inclinations), we decided to share a few things rather than indulge in a hulking steak platter each. First, we dug into the complimentary bread--pillowy fresh white bread with soft butter--then got the Korean fried cauliflower and baked brie appetizers. These were both fantastic. The cauliflower fried up wonderfully, the breading crispy enough to withstand hefty flavoring with a hoisin ginger sauce, along with sesame seeds and scallion. The baked brie was gooey and satisfying, served with basil pesto, red pepper jelly, and crostini.  Since The Keg is a steakhouse, we went for rare red meat for the bulk of our meal. We shared the prime rib and the rib steak, with sides of asparagus and garlic mashed potato, with some tuna tacos for good measure. The prime rib was great, juicy and easy to tear into, served with horseradish and red wine herb jus. The bone-in rib steak was good, too, if not as flavorful. It came with some sautéed green beans, mushrooms, and red bell pepper, for some reason. This was a solid side, as was the mashed potato. I was less into the asparagus, which was oddly woody. Surprisingly, the tuna tacos were as good as the steak, worth ordering if you want a cheaper, lower calorie entrée option. They came with seared rare ahi, cabbage slaw, cilantro, and jalapeño maple aioli on warm tortillas.  This was a really fun dinner. The setting was comfortable but a little bit fancy, and we had a nice, hearty meal. I'd recommend The Keg if you're looking to get some steak and wine in downtown Toronto, for business or pleasure or both."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Keg after work for years. Despite the Bay St. bustle it remains a decent place to drink and order a couple of appetizers. Since Earl's opened up across the street, the younger crowd seems to have migrated over there, while the older set remains at the Keg.  Get here before 4:30 or you'll never find a seat. And if you like married men who are out trolling... this is your place. If you're here around 7 pm, you're likely to see several wedding ring bespangled left hands trying to grab asses that are way too hot and far too young for them.  I had distant family from out west, whom I was only meeting for the fist time, come to Toronto and call on me to meet for drinks. Since their hotel was on York St, I asked them to meet me at the Keg. Being that they were fairly outdoorsy people who are completely unfamiliar with the suits downtown, they still had a good time with the people watching.  Four martinis, four rum and cokes, an order of Calamari and Mushrooms Neptune came to under $100. The price was right and the drinks were good. The food, however, was pretty substandard on this visit. Mushrooms tasted like they had been sitting under the heat lamp for far too long and the calamari was tough and way overcooked.  Service, albiet really in your face and pushy for customers to order food, was never far away and always ready to bring another drink. I like that.  My relatives are super cool (obviously-- they're related me me), and we had an amazing time getting to know each other."}
{"text":"Had the surf and turf special which included two 3 oz. filet mignon medallions and a half lobster tail. The lobster tail was delicious. The steak on the other hand, was very bland tasting for filet. Also had the mixed vegetables as a side, and these were extremely bland and literally had zero flavor."}
{"text":"I recently went to the Keg with my aunt and uncle and two young cousins who were visiting from out of town. My youngest cousin has a deadly peanut allergy, which was always a big concern while dining out. I had researched restaurants that were peanut safe and heard the Keg was very good at dealing with allergies so I figured it would be the best spot to go to dinner. I notified the waitress about peanut allergy as soon as we got to the table. She was very pleasant and told us that we were in good hands and explained to us what meals were suitable for my cousin and what to stay away from (which included the bread to my surprise). A few moments later, the restaurant manager (a tall thin man) himself came to our table and went through the entire menu again as well as all the food content and how everything is prepared in the kitchen. By then we were very impressed by the service and overall care. A few minutes later, another young woman came to our table to confirm all the orders and make everyone feel comfortable which was yet another gesture, which further increased the level of service. Our meals were wonderful. My cousin's steak was a little too undercooked for her liking but they nicely took it back for her and cooked it a little and were so pleasant about it. To top the dinner off, our waitress came by with complimentary desserts and of course one specifically made for my cousin. I would absolutely recommend this location and I will be going back in the very near future. Absolutely wonderful service and food!"}
{"text":"A regular on my rotation - I eat here on average once a week when traveling to Toronto for work.  Consistent, good food.  The steaks are cooked exactly the way I like them, the salads have the right dressing to veggie ratio, the complementary hot bread is like a fluffy carb cloud, and the waitstaff and barstaff are friendly without being overbearing. I can't speak to the mixed drinks, but the wine is not bad.  I often sit alone at the bar if none of my co-workers are leaving work when I am, and I feel comfortable here."}
{"text":"The keg rocks! Dinner was exactly as I expected... amazing! Our server was top notch, we would love to steal her! Lol!! The keg size cosmos were a great compliment to dinner!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Ambiance is that of a banker reataurant / bar, which is fine. Very good service."}
{"text":"In Toronto, Yelp guided me the way to here.  The atmosphere was just what I like: Fireplace, Leather chairs, Steaks, Whiskey, Awesome bar, great food."}
{"text":"Our first night in Toronto and our hosts wanted to take us to a quintessential Canadian restaurant. I had no idea that The Keg qualified as such and I decided not to share with them that there was a Keg restaurant about 10 minutes from my office in Bellevue. Still, I hadn't actually eaten at a Keg in decades, so I was already thinking about writing my Yelp review, even as we waited for a table to become available.   I was surprised that on a Tuesday night it took nearly an hour to be seated. That's indicative of Toronto's vibrant night life as well as a sign that maybe The Keg was a better restaurant than I remembered it being so many years ago.   When we were finally seated, it was immediately clear that this was much more of an upscale restaurant than I remembered. We started with drinks and the restaurant had a nice selection of common bears and local offerings. I had a Rickards White, an unfiltered wheat beer, produced in Etobicoke, just outside of Toronto. It was quite good although I was disappointed to learn after the fact that it's owned by Molson. (I would much rather support smaller micro-breweries.)    The Keg menu was nicely diverse, but at its heart, The Keg is a steak restaurant so I thought long and hard before I opted for something other than steak, ultimately settling on the beef short ribs ($31.95). They were falling off the bone delicious. My table mates thoroughly enjoyed their meals as well, which included the Pecan Sirlion ($24.95), Teriyaki Chicken ($19.95), 8 oz Teriyaki Classic Steak ($27.95) and 8 oz Sirlion w/ Tiger Shrimp ($28.95). (All prices in CAD.) Most of us started off with a salad and many of us ended the evening with dessert. I went all in on the dessert; ordering the Sweet Minis sampler which included a fudge brownie, butter tart and crème brulee.    Total, including tip, the dinner was CAD $305.18, so about $60 a person, just about what I would expect.    The restaurant itself is huge, modern and bustling. The staff was attentive throughout the evening and I never once had to ask for my water glass to be refilled. All in all, our dinner at this \"quintessential\" Canadian restaurant was terrific and I would absolutely visit it again upon returning to Toronto.  Normally I wouldn't award a chain restaurant five stars, but I think The Keg exceeded the naturally high benchmark I have in place for a restaurant of this sort, so five it is!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were visiting Ontario and was looking for a place near our hotel to get a good dinner. As we strolled we noticed The Keg and decided to give it a try since it was recommended by the hotel bartender and we were so glad that we did! The food was delicious! The menu was a satisfactory combination of steakhouse, seafood and bar food. We were seated out on the patio which we did not mind since the weather was nice (it was June) and the server Was pretty friendly. I don't remember what my friend ordered but I had the Keg raspberry lemonade, an appetizer of escargot, 20oz rib steak with a side of the steamed asparagus.  The steak was fixed how I like it, the asparagus was ok, needed a bit more seasoning, and the escargot was very appetizing. My portion of the meal totaled $64.22"}
{"text":"Delicious steakhouse. The food was amazing and the service was quick & efficient. I had the steak and lobster tails. It came with two lobster tails which was great. For the quality of food & service they provide the prices are more than reasonable."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Took my girlfriend here last weekend for a big celebration. The food is like any other keg: delicious, but it was the atmosphere and service that really made the date special.   The restaurant has a very classy feel with modern contemporary styling. Our booth for two was absolutely perfect and our server was unbelievably attentive. Both steaks were perfect and we both loved the escargot  and baked Brie which we shared.   The restaurant is also close to Massey Hall so we were able to walk over after our matinee show. Great day all around."}
{"text":"I had such a wonderful experience here last night for our final dinner in Toronto. We were pleasantly greeted by Andrew. He was such a professional, hospitable and wonderful waiter. Nothing but great things to say about this man, he truly killed it with our large party of 20-25 people.  We all ordered SO much incredible food and wine and I didn't once feel neglected or like I waited too long for him or our food. He was so great.   Appys:   Korean Fried Cauliflower: Absolutely DELICIOUS! Flavour was so full bodied  and wonderful I just couldn't get enough.   Baked Garlic Shrimp: Literally as good as it sounds. And the bun that came with it oh my gosh, it was sweet and fluffy and just epic.   Bread: The bread and whipped butter at the keg literally NEVER disappoints. So hot, fresh and fluffy. Pure love. Yum.  Caesar Salad: Very good. Maybe a tad heavy on the dressing, but overall very nice.  Mains:  Chicken Supreme: Very crispy skin and beautiful juicy meat. Really loved this dish. It came with garlic mashed potatoes which were so great and bacon Brussel sprouts. It was all so great. I even ordered a side of Demi glaze, just to be extra crazy haha. It was SO good. My gosh we had so many appys it was hard to finish so I took the rest to go. I wish I could have eaten it all while it was hot lol. I didn't want to stop lol.   My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon & bernaise sauce with a double baked potato. He loved the filet, but did complain a bit about the potato being a bit dry.   Wine:   We ordered a bottle of New Zealand Stoneleigh Sauvignon Blanc. I'm a huge fan of non sweet & dry white wine, I usually drink New Zealand Oyster Bay, but they didn't have. I think this one ties with my favourite! It was great and truly went so well with our food.   Dessert:  As if I even had room for that.. lol but Creme Brûlée is my absolute favourite dessert ever. And they had a full AND \"mini\" option for it! So I figured I could squeeze in a mini option LOL. I asked for a side of whipped cream and he gave that to me for no charge, that was very nice of him.   Overall it was such a great experience, from the food to the staff to the ambiance - it was purely wonderful. And the price, too. For our dinner for two with ALL of that food and bottle of wine only came to 140$.   Thank you The Keg!!   M.M"}
{"text":"When visiting Toronto, The Keg has always been a reliable source of a good time with good food.  It's similar to me to the chain restaurants in the US such as Claim Jumpers, Outback Steak House and Stuart Anderson's Black Angus.  It's casual family styled dining."}
{"text":"Very consistent quality of food from location to location. I never have to worry when choosing the keg. We came here for lunch because I got an email blast about lobster season at the keg, but when I got there, there was no evidence of it. I had seen on the online menu that a lobster tail was available to order with your main but could not see it on the menu. When I asked the server about it, she knew of it and told me that I could order it. If I was given the lobster fest menu, I would have probably ordered a lobster appetizer as well, but I could not remember what I had seen on line and was too lazy to look it up. If there is advertising for the company for a special menu, the restauranta should all offer them, otherwise what's the use of advertising it? But it was still a good, solid meal. Cheesecake was not my style that I enjoy (I like them more dense and more cream cheesy taste, this one was more whipped and less cream cheesy) and the peach cobbler was interesting, it was okay. There were these crunchy rice things in it....I haven't decided yet if I love it or not, but it was still okay."}
{"text":"The ambiance, food and service were great all at an excellent price.  At our table we all enjoyed our food: seared ahi tuna, fillet mignon, and prime rib. All the salads and soups were great too! We had drinks including a Caesar, a plain non-alcoholic ginger beer, and a crown and Coke (which was delivered separately so could see we weren't underserved)! They also let us replace the standard veg with asparagus in addition to our side dishes. All of the food was excellent!  The service was continuous. They were constantly serving more water, and gave us everything we needed for dinner once the soup and salad were cleared. We felt especially cared for.   Being from the Detroit area, I wasn't used to how loud music in Toronto restaurants is usually played. When I walked in, I thought it would be hard to hear my dining companions when talking. But even though the music was clear in the seating area, we had no problem enjoying each other's company. The bar was louder than the seating area, in case you have someone  in your party with a heating challenge, I'd say sit at a table instead of the lounge."}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance here. The food here is decent. One of the food orders got messed up, but it was promptly fixed by the staff. I do have to say the service here is a lot better than other Keg locations."}
{"text":"First time visit and I'd go back. Had the Teriyaki Salmon (off of the Winter Grill menu which the server said they'd only had a week yet it is mid February) - nicely cooked with a dipping side of the teriyaki.  Restaurant was very busy but we were seated quickly.  Service was nicely attentive. Bread was served very warm and was very good."}
{"text":"Made reservations early and so glad we did!  Wonderful service and amazing staff attend to every need.  We decided the patio for our group and all ordered various apps and dinners.  Everything was gorgeous and delicious.  Not once did we wonder where our server was.  They attended and delivered zeeee best evening.  Thank you Keg steakhouse, we will return again and again I' m sure."}
{"text":"Great Bay Street bar. Stop I always get primary and I'm never disappointed. Servers are great I love the gym or Cabernet Sauvignon  Seven oaks."}
{"text":"My mentor and I came here right after drinks at Againist the Grain. He had a friend who was here with a bunch of people and wanted to go in and make an appearance. When you're a lawyer or any type of professional that requires interaction with others, it is very important to make an appearance even though you don't want to or you don't have time, if even for a second (but it's never really for a second).   This Keg is snazzier and way more trendy than all the other Kegs I've been to, not that I've been to many because I'm vegan. It's dark, with beautiful furniture and interior design with a cool lounge atmosphere. Sadly we didn't get to enjoy the interior, my mentor's friends were outside on the patio. According to my mentor, when this Keg first opened its patio, it was the most happening patio and the one you want to be seen on.  Tonight it was still pretty 'happening': it was packed full of suits, the typical Bay Street types from the surrounding office towers. It was loud and everyone was having a good time, or at least seemed like it. I honestly couldn't hold a meaningful conversation because I couldn't hear the people around me and had to shout alot, which sucks because that's not my type of convos that I like to have.  The drinks were ok, I had a glass or two of a Cab, but I can't comment on the price because I didn't see the drink menu, nor did I pay for it.  When you're with a group of people you just met, I find it easier to go with the flow and take what they offer you.   I'm not sure if I'll come back... maybe with a suit and when I'm invited. Definitely not my first choice of after-after work drinks place, but I'm easy going and able to adapt to different surroundings. Bar hopping on a Thursday night... with this being the second bar of the night, it kind of exhausted me before 10PM."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Keg in the downtown core. It's sleek, sexy and dark with flat screen tvs abound in the bar area for extra entertainment. A little intimidating with the suits mingling in the bar area and the back patio on most weekday nights but hey we can all hang right? The inner dining rooms are fairly quiet, spacious booths and tables for eating and drinking. Drink list is varied which is must for a steakhouse; if you're gonna eat steak it's nice to have your pick of liquids to wash it down with.  I've been here often enough with my better half and we usually enjoy a ceasar salad or escargots followed by our choice of steak. He prefers the striploin whereas I'm partial to the prime rib here (always tender and served with horseradish) or if I have to deviate then the juicy baseball cut will do for me, it's a thick piece of meat and they grill it just right to lock in the obligatory juices.   True the Keg is a chain and this Keg is perhaps the most 'corporate' in tone of them all but if i'm looking to engage in some carnivorous fun then this place does it for me in terms of value and comfortability. I still get a kick however gaffawing over the cheesiness of their tv commericials."}
{"text":"Mid-core steakhouse. Nothing fancy.  Here's what we had:  Appetizer: goat cheese - this tastes great! though I was on a diet and couldn't have too much cheese, I did enjoy every single bite I had.   Steak: filet mignon - i'm not a meat-lover, but I do love steaks. Or should I say I do love filet mignon, because that's the only steak I eat. So i've had filet mignon for many many times in different restaurants, including some top steakhouses in NYC and some michelin 3-starred restaurants. While, I have to say, the steak here is just ok. I ordered blue-rare and it wasn't as rare as i usually had. Even after I had been craving for steaks for days, this filet mignon failed to delight me.   Dessert: Passion brulee. Was happy it comes in small portions so that I could satisfy my sweet tooth without taking too much carbs. Well, but this one disappointed me. It missed the creamy part of creme brulee and I didn't taste a bit of passion fruit.   Overall, a-ok place. Service was good and ambiance was pleasant. But prob won't go back for the steaks."}
{"text":"This is my \"must stop and eat at\" place in downtown Toronto- always excellent! Had lunch this past Friday: classic Teriyaki Sirloin & Fries. Terrific! But just as terrific are the nice servers at the bar- they kept it friendly and fun while keeping my glass filled. Worth the short walk up York St from Union Station/Air Canada Centre or anyplace downtown!"}
{"text":"It is a great steak house, which is all about perfectly cooked steaks without terribly overpriced bills."}
{"text":"One of the better Kegs. Not all are the same. This place has a consistency in service and food quality."}
{"text":"Awesome dining experience! Loved the escargot, filet, mashed potatoes, and veggie medley. Cheesecake was TO DIE FOR. Such a pleasant surprise for dessert to be on the house. We would totally go back! Amanda was fabulous and very attentive."}
{"text":"Post business meeting I thought it would be good to bring my colleagues for dinner before they fly back to Van. Maybe we were too early to order the prime rib 5:45, the slice I received was extremely fatty. I wished I had taken a picture of what I left in my plate to illustrate my disappointment. A good server would have noticed how much fat was on my plate and would have commented or suggested an alternative or better, would not have served it in the first place.   My colleagues had chicken and their meal was fine."}
{"text":"If I was just rating food, this would be super easy. A clear 4/5, only because there's no 4.5 But while the ambience was great, atmosphere was great, and food was excellent, for one reason and one reason alone....it's hard for me to consider it to be an excellent dining experience. And that reason is service. May be it was an isolated thing, may be it was a misinterpretation, may be it was something else. But I found the service at my table a bit snobbish, a bit \"I'm better than you\" type.  Forgetting about that one thing.....the rest of the dining experience was great.  We ordered red wine by glass, and a Keg margherita. The margherita was one of the best we've ever tasted.  In appetizer, we order the scallop and bacon dish. The scallops were perfectly cooked, the bacon was crisp and good quality, served hot on a skewer with a delicious chutney. In my opinion the chutney didn't complement the dish that well, but its a matter of opinion. The chutney in itself was quite nice. For mains we ordered a pepper steak with whisky peppercorn sauce, and fries. It came with grilled beans and bell pepper. The steak was cooked perfectly to meadium, the veggies were still crisp, the sauce complimented the steak well, and the fries were good as well. We also ordered prime rib with garlic mash. The prime rib was also done to the correct temperature, mash was flavourful and creamy. The jus accompanied the dish well. The prime rib was too much on the fatty side for my taste, but again, I know thats a matter of opinion. Many people would enjoy a fatty prime rib. But I do think that the white fat could on the sides could have been rendered better.  Overall, this was a great dining experience. We were greeted by warm and smiling hostesses and seated at a nice corner table. Even the server offered us warm bread, and did his job well. But there's a reason why hospitality is a special industry. Like it or not, it relies heavily on being hospitable. One person's attitude or even the perception of a judgemental attitude can spoil an otherwise great experience."}
{"text":"This particular Keg location is a very reliable choice for a business meal (even at lunch) in Toronto's Financial District. Food is delivered quickly, it's a nice and classy setting, ambiance is super professional yet trendy, and service is friendly and courteous. It's also a nice setting for a date, or even a get-together where you're aiming for a swanky yet conventional atmosphere.   We visited specifically for a work lunch on a weekday, and we were seated right away. Menus delivered within minutes, and drinks delivered in a very timely manner. Food to table time was about 12 to 15 minutes, and we were back at our desks in under an hour. Service was very respectful of our time, and knew we didn't want to stay very long. However, this didn't compromise the quality of our meal at all - the food was still very delicious, well presented, and well made. Their menu presents very dependable options that caters to a variety of people and tastebuds.   While all Keg locations aren't alike, I was really pleased with this particular location, and I'd definitely come back - this spot is good for lunch, dinner, drinks, and can absolutely be counted on as an old-faithful."}
{"text":"While in Toronto with the race team I ended up eating here 3 times! That good! Their peppercorn New York strip was worth it. I'll be back next season."}
{"text":"To compare this to an American steakhouse, it's a fancier version of Outback steakhouse or Texas Roadhouse. Price is very reasonable, i went when the Canadian currency was strong than US. I believe 1.00 CAD to 1.06 US.   I had the ribeye (my favorite) along with the double baked potato. Delicious! I usually like to kill my steaks in A1 sauce at chained restaurants, but they seasoned it just right so that i was able to just eat the steaks by itself. They sat us right next to the fireplace so it was a tad warm, but i recommend visiting the Keg for the food and ambiance."}
{"text":"Middle of the road steak house, not bad but not good either.  Some many better options in the downtown core.  Last time I was there I asked for a NY rare and as the waiting walked away I got scared they would over cook it so I asked for BLUE rare, the waiter didn't know what that meant so I assured him the \"chef\" wold know.  I got a well done steak that o sent back and got another well done steak.  Long story short I grabbed a cheese burger on the way home.  Some hits, lots of misses."}
{"text":"I love the steak and the atmosphere. It's really nice. It's perfect for business meeting, a date night, and family dinner. I think keg is my go to steak house. Especially this one, since it's bigger and fancier. Hehe."}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday night and it was my first time at the Keg!  The food was phenomenal. I genuinely didn't understand what all the hype was about until this night. I had the NY steak which came with twice baked potato and greens/red pepper on the side. The steak was cooked exactly how I wanted and VERY tasty! I couldn't get enough! The double baked potato is a must try!!!!  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because our waiter disappeared a lot. We had to flag down other waiters in order to get help/pay for our bill.  Other than that I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Oh the lovely Keg, so many options and locations.   Venue is dark, just the way I like it. I don't appreciate really lite up restaurants.   Dinner Order:   They started us off with the Baked Bread and Butter, warm and toasty!  Bottle of Pinot Noir - Village Reserve ($69) It's a very light body, tasty wine and I normally hate red wine, this one might be my new fave red to drink if I ever drink red again)   Filet Mignon 10oz ($39)  Tenderloin wrapped in applewood smoked bacon and served with Bernaise.   Pistachio Crusted Salmon ($30) Served on garlic mashed potato, bacon sautéed Brussels sprouts, and maple butter.  Very filling, there was no room for dessert!"}
{"text":"One of the most incredible meals I have experienced and tasted! So good we came back for a round two the same weekend. On our first visit, between myself and my Fiance, we ordered:  -Steak and Lobster -Steak and Alaskan King Crab  The food was well prepared and cooked just right. Our waiters Chris and Chris were both fantastic!  We will for sure be back for more!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Got the blue cheese filet - who can go wrong with a filet smothered in blue cheese, garlic cloves and surrounded by bacon? Was cooked to perfect med rare. Not under or over done. Was here by myself for biz so sat at the bar and waitress/bartender was cool when I asked her what I should do when in town (not surprisingly, said go see a hockey game!)  ambiance is cool. They have a good Pandora-like trendy station playing. Would def go back!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had! Hands down! If you're in Toronto you would be an idiot not to try this place!"}
{"text":"When my friend suggested dinner at the Keg, my reaction was first to yawn, then check the menu online to see what I could have other than a steak. Don't get me wrong, I like steak, but I eat it like once a year (?) Its so heavy, I feel full for days (I need the room for Kothu Roti-please refer to my Samsara review for details of this addiction).  Ok back to the Keg. My first impression was 'holy s$#t rich people eat here!' I couldn't help it, people are dressed so nice, they are walking advertisements from GQ/In Style. Even the waitresses were better dressed than me. I began to feel slightly self-concious in my blowfish flats that have been mistaken for slippers....  The restaurant is super nice looking, and fits into the posh style of the financial district. I love the fireplace jutting out of the wall when you first walk in. The ambience was lively and exciting! We sat outside on the patio, trying to soak up one of the first warm evenings this year! I ordered the spinach salad, my friend had the same but with steak. My other two guests both ordered the salmon. And I shared an appetizer of the garlic shrimp.  The shrimp were average. They appeared to be soaking/swimming in little butter filled cups, not exactly the healthy appetizer choice I imagined. But like any seafood dipped in butter, they were delicious.  My salad was surprisingly large sized and very filling! It had strawberries, pralines, and goat cheese. I wondered who has the appetite to eat a salad that size followed by a steak dinner! My friend who had steak with her salad ended up taking half her meal home. The other two both enjoyed their salmon and veggies.  Overall a great experience. I would go back for the ambience. If you love steak, and rich people, then you will enjoy this keg location!"}
{"text":"Ate at the bar, I had seen them advertised at a couple of Blue Jays games. Great steak and an OK selection of draft beer. Good service and not too noisy, they had the Blue Jays game on so that helped. You pay a bit for a good steak but it was worth it."}
{"text":"My first Keg dinner experience was with Gayle and our Calgary friends (Jim and Kathy) at Banff. It was a great meal and a wonderful time together. That Keg had sort of a family lodge feel and was certainly a full step (or two) above Outback or Black Angus.   A few weeks ago, I was on a business trip in Sarnia Ontario. After a full Friday work day, 3 of us decided to make the 3-4 hour drive up to Toronto (via the 402/401) for the weekend. There was a fair amount of truck traffic coming up, so we didn't roll into Centre City until around 10 PM. We were all tired and being a morning person, I would of been happy to check into the hotel and fade into the evening. However, my project leader (whose family lives in Scarborough) insisted that we have dinner together before she headed home. And with a Keg close by to our hotels, why not?   This Keg took my Banff experience and added a cool city look and feel. Since there was a 20 minute wait for a dinner table, we started out in a bar that was filled with stylish and happy people who were starting their weekend. We sat at the bar and enjoyed our beer and appetizers and before we knew it, we were seated.   When I'm in Canada, I tend to stick to local choices, including wine. The Niagara region in Ontario has some excellent choices, and to we found a delicious red that matched my most excellent \"Bleu Cheese Filet\" and some great conversations perfectly.   It's nice when the stars align after a long and stressful day (especially when you initially didn't want to go to dinner). I went back to the hotel full and happy, with a deeper positive understanding of my colleagues and our company, and with directed motivation to have a great weekend in Toronto."}
{"text":"The action is near the bar. For-two seating is bland, lacks creativity, had sharp bright spot lighting, and is too cramped for intimacy."}
{"text":"Went here for a date before I left for vacation. the place was nice, the desk service was very nice when i asked if we could have a booth seat. Food was good, took a while but i understand it takes time to cook. Service, from the waiter was not so great. We waited almost 15-20 mins before he even notices us and asks if we want to order. We got water and the menu from another waiter that notices us waiting for something to happen. He wasnt very talkative or nice until the end when he tried to persuade us to get dessert.  From my previous experiences at the Keg was just fine and fun, but that was because i was with my family, I tend to notice that the service would treat you differently if you are young and out with a friend/significant other. From that, i found it very offensive that the Keg's services would be like that. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I got in late from Cali and was hungry.  Found out this place was open until 2am and they served food until 12:30.  I ordered a NY steak, it was a bit overcooked for med-rare, I didn't complain.  But, the bartender could tell that the order wasn't right.  She sent the food manager over and they cooked me another one...and they didn't even charge me!  How awesome and sweet was that.  I had another drink and left a nice tip!  Love the environment and was able to watch the first NFL game of the 2012 season."}
{"text":"When I ate steak this was the place to go for a decent - consistent - reasonable price point Steak.  Although a chain - it doesn't have that generic chain quality to the food.  I have gone to many steak places (some very expensive) - and found myself realizing that the expensive steaks didn't even really compare to The Keg.  a) excellent steaks b) good price-point for the food c) good ceasar salad d) yummy garlic mash potatoes e) Kegsize drinks are good value (but don't drink and drive - as the Kegsize is bigger than the average pour) f) good overall place for date/celebration/friends/intimate/business etc. g) all Keg's are consistent in the sense it doesn't matter which one you go to - it is generally the same good experience in the food and friendly staff  I have always found The Keg every bit as good - if not better than some of the most expensive Steak places in Toronto."}
{"text":"I had no idea what the Keg was when I moved to Toronto. They don't have them in the U.S., but boy would they love the Keg there! I don't go often, and usually when I do, it's with colleagues and clients, but everytime I go, I enjoy it.  This Keg has it down. They are always rammed, but they get you through unscathed, and in fact, better than that: they get you through with lots of libations, flavourful thick steaks, and a lighter wallet. It's not cheap, but you get what you pay for. I really think they do a great job with a hectic crowd. Even for extra-large groups, they get it right here. I have never ever had a bad steak or a bad morsel of any food at this Keg.  Do NOT go if you are looking for a quiet night. I mentioned earlier, this place gets rammed. And other reviewers have said it before: lots of suits. This is a place to go with some colleagues for drinks - it's a party in here. A party with lots of good cuts of beef. My kind of party!"}
{"text":"Couldn't have asked for better food. For it being a nice steakhouse, the prices weren't too up there. Definitely worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Good steaks and stiff drinks.   It's a whole lot bigger that it looks from the outside, and a lot swankier than the name suggests."}
{"text":"It's the Keg. You know what you're in for. Great steak, decent prices. Love."}
{"text":"I ordered a NY strip. Was so hungry. This place has a rad vibe. Staying pretty close. Anyway - was def feeling a steak and my coworkers were in. As stated, NY strip is what I ordered. The keg does a great job of posting their temp parameters, etc. I ordered mine medium rare but closer to the \"rare\" side they had the definition for. Long story short, mine was medium, or at least how you would Order medium where I'm from.   I mentioned to the server. She was awesome. Danielle, am assuming she's a manager or asst. manager, came over and spun it that it may be the \"natural light\" that may fool me into believing I was wrong. I was entering the Toronto spin zone. To her credit, she totally stated that \"she\" would yank one off the grill and bring it out. I'll pass on taking that chance. I wonder if Danielle would be interested in a sales job?   Two stars. For my experience and for only offering one steak with a bone in it.."}
{"text":"we came here for a team building lunch which happened to have been my birthday.  I've been here before, and the service is always great! I decided to have their Applewood steak drizzled with chipotle tomato aoli sauce served with roasted red peppers, and sweet potato fries!  Cooked to perfection, medium, the sauce really complimented the steak, as well you also had the option to use the aoili sauce as a dip for your fries.  For dessert we had their ice cream chocolate coffee cake...i forgot the name of it.  nonetheless, the sweet tooth dessert was a perfect conclusion to our brunch.  overall experience was a 4/5"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best steakhouses I've eaten at in a long time. Everything from the food to the decor to the service was top notch. Our server was very friendly and guided us through the menu with ease.  The bread was warm, hot in the center and to die for. I wish I ate more haha considering it was some of the best bread I've had in any restaurant. The cauliflower steak appetizer was a real treat considering I've never had one before. Picture a regular steak only you're eating cauliflower instead. It was cooked nicely and the chickpeas and asparagus were great accompaniments. I ordered a baseball top sirloin for my entree and it was far from disappointing. It was cooked to perfection, had a great crust and was juicy and flavorful on the inside. It has to be one of the best steaks I've had in a long time. The asparagus was great as was the caramelized onions.   All in all, this is a great restaurant. One that rivals Morton's, The Capitol Grille and even Mastro's. Hopefully I'll get the chance to come back here someday. Or at least open a location in New York City so it's closer to where I live lol."}
{"text":"Keg Steakhouse + Bar is a steakhouse chain in Canada. The restaurant has a great atmosphere - friendly staff, dimmed lighting, music playing in the background, and walls are decorated with abstract art. The restaurant has a full bar and the bartenders are nice enough to charge your cellular devices behind the bar. The restaurant was packed, the service was a bit slow (1.5 hour) but the manager was apologetic and attentive. He personally delivered our food and made sure we got everything we needed. It showed that he really cared about customer satisfaction. What he did really significantly improved our dining experience that evening!  For drinks, we shared a pitcher of Red Sangria. It was garnished with orange, cranberries, and raspberries. It was fruity and refreshing.   While we were waiting on our entrees, our server brought us warm bread (fresh from the oven) and whipped butter.  Shortly after, those that ordered appetizers received them. The Keg Caesar Salad consisted of freshly chopped romaine lettuce, shredded aged parmesan, and garlic herb croutons tossed in house made creamy Caesar dressing.   The men in the party ordered the Key Prime Rib Classic. They had a choice of 10oz or 14oz. Both went with the smaller piece of prime rib served medium rare. It was a nice generous serving of tender red meat - not too lean and not too fat. It was served with your choice of salad and seasonal vegetables (e.g., red bell peppers, green beans, asparagus, and mushrooms). My brother added a baked potato loaded with butter.  I ordered the Pistachio Encrusted Salmon. The Atlantic Salmon was brushed with maple butter and encrusted with pistachios. It was served with  buttery garlic mashed potatoes and bacon sautéed brussel sprouts. The salmon was fresh and the combination of ingredients made the entree a  sweet and savory one.  My mom ordered the Sesame Tuna. The Ahi Tuna was seared rare and served with cabbage slaw in a soy sesame dressing. The tuna was not as fresh as the salmon as it was a bit fishy to taste.  Since it was my dad's birthday, they brought out a slice of Billy Miner Pie, which consisted of mocha ice cream on chocolately oreo crust, drizzled with hot fudge and caramel sauce and garnished with almonds. It was the first time I've had Billy Miner Pie and it was so delicious I wanted seconds."}
{"text":"A great ambiance, food is wonderful and staff is very helpful and friendly. Order the steak and you will always be satisfied :)"}
{"text":"This is the third time my family and I have been to a keg restaurant and have not been disappointed!   The escargot have the right compliment of flavored to excite any palette.  The tiger shrimp cocktail is yum.   The bacon rapped filet with garlic mashed potatoes and a lobster tail is the true closer on the deal.  I will continue to visit the keg whenever I have the opportunity!   I need to add that the front ladies (Brittany and Cassandra) the bar tender (Jasmine) and our waitress (Stephanie) were the most accommodating ever.  Even with picture taking!"}
{"text":"This is the place to have a great steak, sit back and relax with friends & family! The ambience is pleasant and soothing. I ordered a Rib Eye, Chicago Style & it was the BEST paired with my twice baked Potatoe. Don't worry if you over indulge with appetizers, salad and your meal because the desert is fabulous. They have mini sizes ! Yes mini sizes, so you do not have to worry about topping your meal off with a big desert that you can not finish. Our server Steph, was great and informed us well on the menu specials. Overall, I can say me and my family of 6 enjoyed our dinner at the Keg House.!"}
{"text":"Another restaurant I have gone to 10+ times, typically after Jays games. Steak and service have always been excellent. Just go now!"}
{"text":"I love this location because it's right in the heart of the financial district. You can easily come here after work or during lunch hours even. The service here is top notch. Took my friend here for his birthday and he felt like a king :)   He ordered the steak and it was done exactly to his liking. I got the lobster roll (summer special). It was not too overly drenched with sauce, which I liked.  All in all, really happy with the service and food quality here."}
{"text":"Great flavor on the filet and generous portion of crab, maybe the best sourdough bread I've had in years...try the Creme brûlée.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"If this was located in Austin, \"Austin Land and Cattle\" would have a really close competitor, but they aren't so ALC still holds my #1 Austin steakhouse.   Where do I start. The bar area when waiting for a table resembles an upscale night club. It's loud, packed, hard to get close enough to the bar to order a drink. It was probably the part of the dining experience I didn't enjoy.   When our party of 4 was seated things started looking up. Our waiter was great and very knowledgeable. We all had questions about the steaks and when a couple of us asked him to pick for us he sounded like Alton Brown (why he was picking the steaks for us that he did).   He did not steer me wrong. He told me I would enjoy the Bseball Sirloin because of the thickness and my preference to have it cooked medium rare. He couldn't have picked better for me. The peppery crust and thickness was perfect. The taste was out of this world.   I was relieved that no one in my dinner party requested steak sauce. I get so embarrassed when I am in a nice establishment with great cuts of meat that is seasoned just right and someone drowns it in crap sauce. My ex-mother in law drowned her prime rib in ketchup once - need I say more about her being an ex-mother in law?!   The place was super packed but our food location engineer was absolutely awesome. I look forward to my next trip up in a month or two."}
{"text":"If you've never heard of the keg (aka you're American) it's nothing like outback's steakhouse. it's a classy joint. This location is pretty busy but on a cold friday night, the wait was probably 20 min which isn't bad at all! Not to mention the hostesses wore hot little black dresses and come around with free h'or douvres for people in the waiting area. (Thats right FREE!)  I forgot what our table ordered but I had the bacon wrapped scallops and the baseball top sirloin.  The bacon wrapped scallops were smaller than I thought but still pretty good. (small as in they were served in escargot pods)  the baseball top sirloin was fantastic! It's a steak so thick med-rare is as far as they can cook it! SO GOOD!!! YUM!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal with even better service last night at The Keg. Although my wife's filet was a bit undercooked, they corrected the steak and then comped our wine and dessert. Nice touch. And the atmosphere on the patio was great."}
{"text":"Dined here for dinner last night good location near to where we were staying as well as many other things within walking distance. Quick wait for a large party. Beautiful fireplace as you walk in. Comfortable seating even with a large number of people. Large selection of drinks I had cider and friends had a variety of mixed drinks. I ordered the teriyaki steak with garlic mashed potatoes It also came with a side of beans and peppers. Food was delicious I loved the teriyaki flavor on the steak and it was juicy and cooked to perfection as medium not too rare or over done! Also the potatoes where to die for yum! Great service the waitress was very helpful in meal choices as well as offering ideas for after dinner. We weren't dressed up even though it seemed a classy place no one made us feel uncomfortable with our appearance. Slight wait time on meal but it was a Saturday evening in Toronto and once you taste the food totally worth it! Yumhighly recommend!"}
{"text":"I really can't find anything bad to say. The staff is friendly and helpful. My bartender Kyla didn't just make suggestions but took interest in what my tastes were and brought out excellent choices. For an ignorant wine drinker this is exactly the kind of person you want pouring for you.  The warm sourdough was light and the bacon wrap scallops were cooked perfectly.  To no one surprise the sesame tuna has an Asian flare. For this sushi lover the cook and temperature were spot on. I have to admit I was a bit skeptical stepping into a chain but this one should be proud and will definitely be on my list for a revisit."}
{"text":"People... stop complaining about how people are dressed and let's talk Steak which is what this place is all about. The 20oz ribeye is a must try and definitely the best one I have ever had. Chicago style is just perfect in my opinion as it adds some char flavor without losing the juiciness! Fantastic service and very competitive price. Forget Ruth's Chris, come here instead for a perfect steak experience. The mocha ice cream dessert is a perfect finish!"}
{"text":"On July 4th my now husband and I ran away to City Hall - with my parents, his dad and our 4 year old daughter - to get married. We decided to go to here for dinner as the menu was great for everyone (esp my father in law who is very meat and potato). We were all dressed up and were warmly congratulated by everyone who asked us what the occasion was. Dinner was exceptional! All of our meals were amazing. The guys all had prime rib, my mom and I had filets and our daughter had the kids chicken strips with veggies. Our server was amazing! And were well taken care of! I bet we will be back for our first anniversary next year! Thanks to everyone for making what was already a great occasion that much better!"}
{"text":"Huge space with indoor and outdoor seating. Service was a bit confused - for example after we finished our meal and the table was cleared a new waiter came by and put bread on our table thinking we had just got there. There were only two beers on tap which is odd for a place called the keg. The calamari, steak skewers and garlic shrimp appetizers were good - especially garlic shrimp. I had the baseball steak for dinner which was also good."}
{"text":"Beautiful place with cozy booths. Food is too good. Service is also decent. As soon as we placed order for our appetizers and beverages the server brought us the complimentary bread. It was warm and freshly baked. We ordered scallops with bacon, was Delicious! Perfectly cooked. In entrees we ordered prime rib with Garlic flavoured mashed potatoes and thin onion fries. Sides were as good as steak. I asked for medium rare. It was cooked beautifully. We also ordered New York strip-loin with fries and veggies. We asked for medium rare. PERFECT is the word. However when I go there next time i will choose mashed potatoes as my sides over fries. Also, we ordered frozen margarita. It was the BEST i have ever had in my life. Its a MUST GO restaurant."}
{"text":"Does anyone remember when this used to be a Movenpick LOL?  Those days are long past --- now it is a Keg and this place is hopping especially in the bar area on Thursdays and Friday evenings.  Standard Keg menu -- lots of great booth seating.  If you want somewhere more quiet - ask to sit away from the bar area.  You cannot go wrong with the menu here.  Something for everyone -- and their wine list also is priced with something for everyone!    Parking is definitely underground near here and on the pricey side (you're in the banking district after all -- but quite a bit cheaper after 6 pm).    The filet mignon is my fave -- get it with a side order of mushrooms and a nice red wine and now you're talking!  lol.  Quite a bit more reasonable that some other steak houses in the area and always a great meal.  Hard to beat in the downtown core.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went to the Keg on York yesterday after work with friends. Got there around 4:45 and had no trouble getting a table for four. As usual at this location, everything was superb.  Service was prompt and food was delicious! You can't go wrong with the Keg Classics.  I started with a wedge salad in blue cheese dressing - so so yummy - and had the teriyaki steak which came mushrooms, red peppers and I got the loaded baked potato.  This is a large meal so I took half home and had the rest for lunch today! Hubby always orders the oscar steak which is covered in fresh shrimp and scallops in a bearnaise sauce. I had a taste of my friend's dessert - Billy Miner's pie... a large slice of heaven. Love the Keg and will continue to make this an after work destination."}
{"text":"Nailed it with perfectly cooked rib eye and tenderloin. Shrimp cocktail is great and the prices are good considering that Morton's is double the price and inferior quality. Excellent service too."}
{"text":"More of a bar scene for the financial district.  It is filled with regular customers and large groups for happy hour.   I ordered a Ceasar salad and wished I had asked for dressing on the side; it was drenched.  My salmon was very good and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Taste: 4 Service: 5 Value: 4 Presentation: 5 Overall: 4.5 rounded up to 5  Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. Trying out the New York Striploin at the Keg today. Our waiter said it is their best steak so I have to give this one a try!  I asked for a medium cooked steak, and surprisingly that's what I got! I was initially worried that they may have overcooked it as a lot of places do, but the meat was tender throughout and I enjoyed the whole experience. The fries were pretty good too and I like how they have some peas to balance the meal.  The service was really good. We got a coat check walking into the restaurant, fancy! Our food came relatively fast and our waiter kept visiting regularly to pour us more water and to check on our meals. He even asked us if we wanted to have separate cheques right off the bat before ordering. He should get a promotion haha.  The steak costed $35 for 12 ounces if I recall correctly. For Toronto standards that is quite average. And for how much I enjoyed the steak, I'd be willing to pay that price for sure!  All in all, food was great, service was awesome, and I really enjoyed my time here. Would definitely try it again in the future. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing the hostesses were friendly and engaged my girlfriend and I in conversation. Our server Chris was incredibly friendly and checked in on us an appropriate amount of times even though the place was packed and when we informed him of my partner's allergies he checked the menu for anything that didn't agree with her. The manager even came out and gave us a break down of foods to stay away from. The food was also very good.  Top notch restaurant."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I think this restaurant is consistently the best value in Toronto. Service is impeccable. I remember a year ago when I had a birthday here with friends and one of them commented on their steak, a server overheard this from quite some distance away and immediately brought them a new steak.  This place sets the standard for how a chain should be run."}
{"text":"Primo steakhouse. Great sides that come with the steaks, great appetizers, excellent martinis and they seemed to have a extensive wine list. I was quite impressed by our very young waitress who knew the wine selection amazingly well and was able to suggest various entrees and wines for our table that all turned out to be perfect. Yes you will pay dearly for this level of quality and service but for the occasional treat, this place is worth every penny. I also have to comment on my perfectly made Stoli martini and excellent creme brullee for dessert."}
{"text":"This lounge is the place to be on Thursday night!! Right in the heart of the financial district, you will get a busy crowd and a great atmosphere! I was in Toronto for business and staying nearby at the Fairmont, which made this location an easy walk for dinner and drinks.  I had a seat in the lounge with a coworker and the service was still super friendly and fast despite how busy it was.  I love the Keg and this is a great location.  PS.  Best caesar's ever!"}
{"text":"We went here twice during a business trip. It was great both times. I had been to the Keg years ago and it seems to have improved significantly. It was good before, but it is even better. Ordered steak topped with lobster, crab and scallops...oh my that was lovely. On the second trip, opted for something lighter but ended the meal with a mini butter tart. That was a yummy little treat! AWhen I return to Toronto,  I will return.   By the way, the wait times were horrific but well worth it."}
{"text":"Just came back from The Keg in the Financial District.  Pretty happening on a Friday night, heaps of people so a great place for people watching.  Service was really good.  Menu was you usual Keg stuff ... was sad to find out that the spinach dip is no longer on the menu ! Shock, shock, shock. The 'replacement' would the Sante Fe chicken dip, which sadly is 'meh' compared to the spinach dip.  Overall, I had a great experience here and would not hesitate to come back."}
{"text":"Nowadays, when I want steaks, I will just go to the Keg because the price is reasonable and I will get what I expected. However, in the rush hour, it is hard to find parking in some locations and huge line up for tables. When you tell them medium rare, they never fail. Also, service is always excellent from receptions to the dining table."}
{"text":"This review is mainly for the super slow service and the steak. I went there with one friend in a Wednesday night. It was super busy at that time. Anyway, it's the finical district so it's all fine. But it took over 40 minuets for them to cook the steak which is really slow. Also, the Medium well there is almost well done, which I am not a big fan of. But overall it's sort of cheap(but not that cheap) for a steakhouse."}
{"text":"Super Steaks, perfekt zubereitet. Toller Service, sehr aufmerksam! Auch die mashed potatoes with roasted Garlic waren ein Geschmackserlebnis der Oberklasse. Wir würden dort jederzeit wieder essen gehen, love it"}
{"text":"Nice steakhouse, good ambiance.  I was alone so ate at the bar.  Overall decent impression.  Would go again.  I love a bone-in Rib Eye and they had one.  Cooked perfectly.  Mushrooms were a little cold, but overall enjoyed it... would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Keg many, many times (various locations across the country) and have never been disappointed.  Service and food are always consistent, and this is why you choose the Keg, because you know what to expect.   However, I had a business lunch here yesterday (I've been to this location frequently as well) that far exceeded expectations.   The staff was very \"on\" that day, but our server Lynette specifically was fantastic.  She was bubbly and charming, came over the \"right\" amount of times, our orders were perfect with no mistakes, all while juggling a busy patio of customers.     We truly did not want to go back to the office.   We left the restaurant smiling.  Job well done!"}
{"text":"Great place to wind down after a tough day at the office. Lots of brews on tap to choose from, good steaks / prime rib, flat screens everywhere to catch a game, and nice young ladies that provide service with a smile! Prices are just as friendly :)"}
{"text":"The Keg on York Street is a very lively Keg with crowds of people from primarily the business community. The interior of the restaurant is modern and everything appears to be clean and well presented.  The service was good in both the lounge and main dining room. The servers appeared knowledgeable and offered us substitutions and changes subject to our tastes and/or allergy positions.  Dinner consisted of the beef tenderloin and a side of french fries. The meat was chewy and too rare. Although I asked without seasoning (that Keg salt/seasoning can sometimes be quite extreme), the meat tasted off almost \"tinny\". The fries were warm, but weren't amazing.  Breads were served and seemed fresh.  This Keg didn't blow me away and this is my second visit to the York Street location. I would recommend other steakhouses in the area.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"This review is meant for the Keg on King street.   First off let me say, if I had a choice between here and Jacobs steakhouse next door, I would choose the keg. Reason being is because I think Jacobs is way over priced for what you are getting.  The Keg had a beautiful decor and atmosphere and the staff was on it!   As for the food:  Appetizers: the Caesar salad we had was really nothing special. The salad seemed like it had been tossed awhile ago and the dressing and flavor was not anything but average.  Shrimp cocktail, were ok, the shrimp tasted fine, but they had a fishy smell to them which slightly turned us off. We usually like extra horseradish and they brought us some but it was the creamy type not the fresh kind.   The main dishes we had were- Filet mignon with the baked potato , this was delicious! The meat was perfectly cooked to our desire and the baked potato fully loaded was so delicious. I wished the potato was bigger bc it was just so good! The baked salmon, another amazing dish we ordered. It was moist and delicious. The only complaint I had was that the rice pilaf that came with the salmon seemed a bit undercooked (meaning a bit hard).  We got a couple sides:   Mushrooms - these were ok, I have had better, but I'm a big fan of mushrooms so they were still tasty!   Brussels sprouts- these were delicious ! Loved these! They were packed with flavor, I just wished their sides were bigger   Dessert: we got the warm brownie! This was delicious! They knocked it out the park with this one. I usually like lava cake when I go to restaurants, but they didn't offer it, but this was definitely a good alternative.   Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"My steak was great and so was my bartender. The atmosphere is great for just about every crowd and there is private and outdoor seating as well. When I come back into the city I will definitely stop by again. The only negative was the crab cake. A true crab cake is ALL crab meat NO fillers like breadcrumbs. The sauce they served with it made up for it a good deal though."}
{"text":"So delicious! Got the French onion soup and lobster summer platter. So much food for one person but it was quality! Modern decor and a great setting for dinner, happy hour or even lunch."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite spot when visiting Toronto. Diverse menu that'll satisfy any palate, and a decent wine selection. I had the escargot, French onion soup and filet trio. Everything was amazing and the steak cooked perfectly. Lively crowd and fantastic service!!!"}
{"text":"Best chain I have visited in Canada or US. I always use The Keg as a fall back when in doubt."}
{"text":"This is the usual Keg fare for food. Always good & tasty with decent service. I ordered the Keg special which was a deal including salad + steak + side. All very very tasty including the steak which was done to perfection. On complaints to be registered here. I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"Man, oh man! I came here after midnight on a Thursday (or early Friday) and I must say I was impressed by this place as it's my first time here. The first thing you need to order is the garlic cheese toast. I don't think I've ever had toast taste or pizza taste this good! The cheese blend that they use is generous on top of the toast. For entree, I ordered a top sirloin classic cooked medium with mashed potatoes. It was cooked to perfection and was flavorful indeed. If you like long island iced teas, you should try one here. My friends got the salmon, NY strip and chicken dishes and they were satisfied as well. I can't wait to come back next time."}
{"text":"Not spectacular, but solid food. You get what you would expect from a steakhouse. I went late (after 9pm), but the service was still slow. That almost dropped them to 3 stars, but there was a very tasty goat cheese appetizer that bumped them back up."}
{"text":"Come with an appetite because that is the only thing stopping you from one of the best restaurant in Toronto. Sirloin, veggies,  bake potato and house bread was superbly done. Alhamdullah!"}
{"text":"This Keg has high quality meat, done the way you want it, good friendly waitresses who are polite, caring and do the right number of fill ups and check ins and a unique architecture and decoration that sets them apart. I had a steak sandwich, asked for it medium, it arrived medium exactly, the side salad was fine and my bun substitution was accepted without any issue. The waitresses are elegant, we observed the lady behind the bar to be very friendly and they have a good number of sides that would make anyone happy (of course, mashed potato is their classic pick). Why not five stars? The food took long to arrive. I believe we waited 30 minutes after ordering to see our food and our complimentary bread was long gone by then. As well, a truly classy restaurant wouldn't have TV sets."}
{"text":"Amazing Steaks, drinks and ambiance! Music is kept at a decent volume level for comfortable dinning. Can't wait to come back and visit before we leave Canada!  Need to bring my son and his friends here for sure!"}
{"text":"this was my second time visiting, first time I had the New York steak, this time the broiled shrimp.  Both were delicious.  Service was good.   No complaints at all.  this was my second time visiting, first time I had the New York steak, this time the broiled shrimp.  Both were delicious.  Service was good.   No complaints at all."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch here this afternoon with a colleague.  I had fried chicken with mashed potatoes.  I'd never had the chicken before and it was delicious!  I would definitely get it again.  Dave was our server and he took excellent care of us.  He was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Always a big fan of the Keg! This location is great!  Had Raptors tickets and a bit of a gift card to use up, so made our way up to the York Street location. It was freezing cold outside walking up York, so we said we'd take the PATH back to the ACC. (Which is SUPER convenient)    We got there right at 4pm (actually got there at 3:45 and they were still locked so we hung out in an office building connected to it that had a really nice lobby) and were seated right away by the window.  Everything came out very quickly and was all cooked very well! Patti's prime rib cut was HUGE and i filled up on crab cakes, steak and shrimp. Shrimp brings melted butter that you can use on your potatoes ;)  No apple crumble though on the newer menus? Sadface.  Paid up and got back into the PATH system which we took all the way to the ACC! Screw being outside when it's cold!"}
{"text":"I read somewhere that they have a sirloin burger that was AMAZING, but apparently that source was mistaken. There are absolutely no burgers on the menu. So automatically I am disappointed. No amazing sirloin burger. No burgers at all. Ordered the prime rib (well done) with mashed potato but was not impressed. The beer was good, but I cannot give the Keg the credit for that. Overall I was unhappy with the experience."}
{"text":"Mediocre.  We came here to see Darrell (who was the manager at the King West location...has since moved to the York Street location) he always makes the dining experience exceptional. Sadly he was not in... maybe he would have saved the evening!  On to dinner: The server was relatively quick on the drink orders. And because we were regulars we know our orders relatively quickly. No real connection was made...but Melanie did her job well enough off the hop. I did have to ask another server to send her our way. And the couple next to us who arrived prior to us received their mains as we left. I over heard them say \"well I guess we have nothing else to do tonight\"   My food: quite lacking! Sadly. I only ordered the tuna tartar (my usual). The fried wontons were cold and stale. I told our server who said a manager would bring out the replacement...I'd imagine to do a table touch...this didn't happen. One of the line cooks did. Fine. There was a visible difference in appearance between the two. Obviously the first set were older/possibly refrigerated. I was satisfied with the replacement wontons. THEN I BIT INTO THE HARD BIT OF THE END OF AN AVOCADO! like the stem circle bit. I didn't even complain about it. I just quit eating.   My husband said the filet mignon was good. Standard keg."}
{"text":"I came here for an early dinner with my parents and their two dogs.  The dogs had to tied to the fence outside and so we grabbed a table on the patio.  No problem.  The waiter we had was excellent.  His recommendations were good, the service was attentive, he even brought water out for the dogs.  We all tried several different items from the menu: crab chowder, calamari, shrimp, crab dinner, sirloin, and a few other little things.  All very good.  Not excellent, but very good.  It seems a bit over priced for the quality, but with this location and the great server it was an above-average experience.  I'd go again, but after reading some other reviews I'd definitely go early again...it's not worth more than a five minute wait to be seated."}
{"text":"This particular Keg has a brilliant patio and excellent bar space."}
{"text":"The Keg does steak and they do it right. It's what they are good at. You can never go wrong with them.  Whah I liked about the York St location - my blue cheese filet was overloaded with blue cheese crust. Guys - this is important. As someone who is a big fan of this Keg classic - this was EPIC. My date and I shared a jumbo lobster tail. Well worth the $40 price tag.  Atmosphere - dark, rich tones. Similar to other locations. Nice ambiance.  Service - excellent. Our server was pleasant and helpful.  There were a few Jays fans here and there (in their jerseys ...c'mon guys) but all were on their best behaviour.  Great location. You need a good steak? You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wowa I've been 2 times to this restaurant a my last visit in Toronto and I can tell you the food is AMAZING !!  I tried steak & half lobster and that was a strange combination at first sight but eventually it was magnificent and the price is correct when you taste the quality of the food and nice helpful service   The keg is referred as one of the best steakhouse in Toronto and I 100% agree with that !  Welcome to the 6"}
{"text":"This review is mainly for the Prime Rib Burger which is now 2 stars for me.   VIBE  Still suits. This time, this location kind of smelled. Don't know why but don't let it dissuade you. It's still a really nice location and I'm a fan of their back patio. Service was good though a bit spaced out and wish the waitress would have paid a bit more attention especially when I wanted to leave.   I ATE Prime Rib Burger. It wasn't \"prime rib.\" This time it tasted like it was cooked from a frozen patty. There are more options for sides and I liked that I could get a spinach salad but the spinach leaves were definitely out of a box. What happened, The Keg?! I swear I wasn't drunk last time I reviewed it! Maybe it's just this location, this time around?   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Hoping that the quality of the filet mignon hasn't gone the way of the burger."}
{"text":"Ahh keg you are my go to birthday dinner spot and you never disappoint!  We celebrated my boyfriend's 30th birthday by having a delicious dinner at the keg on adelaide. We only waited abt 10 minutes for a table on Friday night and I was impressed.... Toronto on a Friday night is never a 10 min wait!  We thoroughly enjoyed our dinners and drinks and dessert...gotta love that birthday billy pie.  Servers were excellent as usual and the food was outstanding...whatbmore can I say? Srsly get your a$$ over there :)  Con is the price but hey you can't eat good steak on a milk budget!"}
{"text":"LOVE IT!!!! It's busy but the sections where people dine are really quite and you can talk to someone over a fantastic prime rib...drool...  The service is always good!  I once got a wine that was suggested by the server and it went sour.  I told the waiter this and the manager came apologized comp'ed our wine and gave us a free dessert.  I actually wish she didn't give us the dessert because now every time I go there I have to have a billy miner...drool!  The prime ribs are amazing, as I talk about it my boyfriend is hinting we should go tonight.  The apps are fantastic we usually get the ahi tuna... It is fantastic it is served with mushrooms and a wasabi sauce.  He hates wasabi but we always fight for this dish!  This place is good for families but during weekdays after work it's REALLY hard to navigate as many people who work around the area go for after work drinks.  The weekends are also really difficult to get a place if you're walking in after 7pm.  During busy times you're looking at around a 30-40 minute wait so ALWAYS make a reservation.  The food is always enough to fill us and the way it's grilled is perfect... I think I'm going for a steak tonight!    Cost: 2 people, 1 apps, 2 mains, 2 desserts $120 ish. Food quality: 5/5 Food quantity: 5/5 Wine Selection: 4/5 Service: 5/5 Perfect for: After work drinks, anything BUT a first date, anniversary, celebrations, great for groups (if you make reservations)  Would I Go Again: Tonight??"}
{"text":"First off I just wanna say that I love the Keg!  Some of the good things I loved about my visit were:  -THE FOOD TASTED AMAZING! (Prime Rib Burger & Lobster Bisque)  -Beer was super cold and went down perfect -The Bread was SUPER fresh from the oven and was perfect -The Service Was 10/10 and didn't go too over the edge with Questions. -Our seats were perfect next to the window and the fireplace -Food Came to our table on time and very hot &  Some things that could have been better:   -The place is so DARK! Turn the lights up a bit -Food and other items are way too expensive -The food portion for the Lobster Bisque was pretty hurting, $11+ for half a bowl is a pretty bad deal.   Other then that...The keg is awesome and I would go back."}
{"text":"My first time here (took my parent's here for a birthday lunch) and the food was very good!  I didn't have a reservation, but was able to find a table in the lounge (first come-first served seating).  Fish and chips were good ... hamburger was freaking delicious ... tasty fries ... excellent creme brulee.  Location of the restaurant was convenient (a short walk if you take the 501 Queen Streetcar) and the server (Emily (?)) was attentive, but not obtrusive.  I would definitely come back to this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"We came here as a group of 13 for a bachelor party dinner. We had a large table in the dining room and even had 2 waitresses for our group. The service was fantastic and the food was also great, they even gave us a free dessert for the bachelor. It seemed like a place with a good balance of casual and formal groups of people. We had a great time and would recommend The Keg for anyone looking for a good meal with good service. Also good for groups!"}
{"text":"First time in Canada and I almost always rely on yelp and its reviews!! I am so glad i chose this steakhouse! I had the sirloin oscar with the scallops and shrimp! I was absolutely delicious and the twice  baked potato hit the spot!! I would def come back and eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of those staples of Toronto dining. Whether lunch or dinner, The Keg will always provide an enjoyable food experience with great service. During lunch, the vibe is a bit corporate and during dinner, it has a more sophisticated vibe.   I've come on a few occasions and each time I've left satisfied. Not blown away, but satisfied. The steak sandwich was very good and they cooked it perfectly, which is always noteworthy. The French onion soup is also delicious. I also once had a steak here that was cooked well done when I asked for medium. The manager came over and apologized, brought out a perfectly cooked one a few minutes later and then gave me a free dessert. Handled it perfectly!  The real reason to come here in my opinion however, is the Billy Miner pie. Good lord, this thing is amazing! It's ice cream on chocolate crust with hot fudge, caramel and almonds. This is the most delicious dessert I've ever tasted... I'm not usually a fan of chocolate desserts, but this thing is on a another level and must be tried.  Overall this place is a great choice if you're looking for a mature atmosphere with good food, or a good steakhouse in general. But either way, definitely get that Billy Miner pie!"}
{"text":"This was amazing. I had the filet & mash , & the side order of baked shrimp with garlic butter & cheese - the best shrimp I've had in long time !!! My daughter had the burger- she loved it , cooked perfectly. My boyfriend had the blue cheese steak & garlic mashed potatoes, he finished eating first , couldn't stop lol  Next time we come to Toronto, this will be on list of places to come back too !!!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite Toronto spots-we always come in when we are in town. They are known for the Billie Meiner Pie which we have devoured twice now. Tonight we had a prime rib, a filet, the baked Brie, crab cakes and the lobster dinner salad. All was delicious!!! Our server Emma was attentive and on point, we will return when we are back."}
{"text":"We went on a week night and the place was fairly packed. Good crowd, and nice ambience. This place is also really big, and it's surprising I didn't know it existed here before this. We were a large crowd of 16 people, and drinks at the bar, seating, service and individual bills were a breeze. Defninitely good and well trained staff.  Food was pretty standard Keg food. Some loved their dishes, some liked them and a couple weren't very fond of what they ordered. One person I know didn't like their meal too much, because the salad meal came with jumbo lettuce heads and it wasn't easy to eat. Desserts were good.  The great: The service, ambience and drinks selection The good: Food (especially love their nachos) Not so good: A couple of dishes like the salad"}
{"text":"The service here is top notch. I generally love the service at most restaurants in Toronto but the Keg on York and Adelaide is exceptional. The staff are knowledgable and genuine, and the food is delicious... from the bread (always piping hot and suuuuuper fresh) to the appetizers to the mains. Everything is outstanding. I come here a few times a year but the one experience that really stood out was the time when my friend from New York was visiting and he asked our waiter what he would recommend. (It was between the rib steak and baseball top sirloin) Our waiter recommended the rib steak even though my friend really wanted the baseball top sirloin but he went with his recommendation anyway. Our steaks arrive and my friend barely touched his steak- our waiter felt so terrible for recommending him a steak he didn't like so it was on the house. SO SWEEEEET. My heart melts.   Recommend:  - Escargots, mushrooms neptune, crab cakes and scallops+bacon (appetizers) - Caesar salad... best saladddd.  - Filet mignon wrapped in applewood smoked bacon or the prime rib."}
{"text":"We had our work Christmas get together here and while our two servers were EXCELLENT, everything else was just sub par. Even though we were booked in for a specific time and could see that the seats were empty, we still had to wait till our exact time slot according to the hosts. When the 1:30 time slot came about, it wasn't till about 1:45 that we were seated.  I ordered the prime rib and it seemed quite flavourless. The au jus was more like an oily afterthought also lacking in flavour. For a place that has 'steakhouse' in its name, I absolutely expected more. The only person who thought the food was good was a colleague who ordered the Medallion steaks with Cajon Shrimp ...I did taste his food and I would agree ....it was good!  Will not be going back here. Two thumbs down Keg......"}
{"text":"I wouldn't call myself a steak snob but it would be fair to say that I am routinely... often... USUALLY disappointed with the steaks cooked anywhere other than my back yard coal fired grill. A good cut of beef is a thing to be honored and prepared with no small degree of reverence and most restaurants that call themselves steakhouses just are are not up to the task.  HOWEVER sometimes a steak is what is required and when on the road sometimes I have little choice but to interview the locals,  cross reference their suggestions with web reviews, calculate a weighted average based on linear progressions, and roll the dice...   SNAKE EYES! Thats a good thing right? Nevermind that, this place has great steaks! I ordered the Baseball Cut Sirloin which, according to the menu, is only served rare or medium rare(a great sign as far as my reverence detector is concerned.) I ordered rare, it came somewhere between rare and medium rare (just right for my taste but I dont want to be the 122-125 degree Fahrenheit or I send it back guy.) It was lean, tender juicy, flavorful, fabulous. But what really got to me, and the reason for 5 stars is the seasoning.  Most people probably dont spend two paragraphs praising the saltiness of a dish but I'm going to. The difference between bland food and food that dances on the tongue and excites the palette is often times... usually, the saltiness. Salt brings out all the other flavors and aromas and a perfectly salted and perfectly cooked steak is... a perfect steak. When Gordon Ramsey is screaming at people about seasoning and bland risotto this is what hes talking about. Salt. And at the Keg, not only was each bite of the outside of the steak well seasoned (which is expected but not always achieved at a high end steakhouse,) the inside was as perfectly seasoned as well! What magic is this!?  According to the bartender (who was delightful and recommended some solid nightlife for after dinner) the steaks are salted 12 hours in advance, in essence brining them. Instead of an extra salty crust that balances out a bland interior, every bite is perfect. Every nibble of every bite is perfect.   I am always excited to learn a new technique and will soon be experimented with and hopefully implementing it at the Sushi Czar household (and I do hope that The Lovely and Talented Sushi Czarina will bear with me if I accidentally jerky, pickle, or otherwise dehydrate a few steaks.)   If you're in the Toronto area looking for a top notch, possibly life changing steak experience, do give The Keg a try... and its not expensive either."}
{"text":"Went here for graduation lunch and the place was fairly empty.  When I told the server that in lactose intolerant, the manager came and made sure the stuff on the menu had or did not have dairy in them.  I fully appreciated The service and the accommodation for menu  items and hope I come here again for another special occasion."}
{"text":"This is an affordable and consistent steak house.  The rib steak is always my favorite and it never fails me.  However the line up can be ridiculous.  Either you come before 6, or you will end up waiting for 90 min for a table"}
{"text":"The food and wine list is incredible!! Went with a group and was so impressed. We had a lovely wine and variety of dishes. I know this sounds insane but I had a salad with beef.  I love steak houses and would never just order a salad but it was the right size and prepared well,  The dressing had a bit of a kick to it.   We also enjoyed the calamari and beacon scallops.  I will definitely return on my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"By far the best steak house in town. Spent a week in Toronto for work, we ended here twice. Great service, and the food was cooked perfect. A must try!"}
{"text":"My favourite of The Keg restaurants is located in the heart of the Financial District and as is to be expected, chock full of suits. If you like men that reek of fiscal prowess and cocaine, hit up Thursday nights: you'll have your pick. The decor is unlike the pastoral layout of your typical Keg restaurant; this York St location features a trendy lounge with spacious couches and long bars to lean against and mingle.  That said, I actually dig the edibles here. If you like Caesars, get them Keg-sized. They make their own clamato.  Obligatory Title Pun: A powderKEG of d-baggery.  Menu Readability: The Keg menu we all know and love. Serifs on cream coloured stock and pleather binding.  Need to Mention: The hostess will actually look at you with a straight face and tell you it's a 2.5 hour wait. Fuck right off.  What this place teaches me about myself: I don't actually hate everyone that works in the financial district."}
{"text":"Came here after visiting the holiday market at Nathan Phillips Square. Upon arrival, we got seated pretty quickly.   The food was AMAZING! For our appetizer, we got the baked garlic shrimp. Despite this dish being delicious, I felt like the bowl they used to make this dish was bad. It was pretty hard to take out the shrimp and as it was small there was hardly anything in there, so you can say it's not worth the price. However, the steak here is to die for! I got the teriyaki sirloin with mashed potatoes and vegetables. It was delicious!! I love coming to The Keg for steak.   Our service was not so great. Despite our waitress being kind, she hardly checked up on us. Also, whenever we needed something, we had to call someone over to call her because she wasn't coming towards us.  Overall, I would return if I'm in the area! If there is a special event, you will want to come celebrate here. A bit on the pricy side, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to the Keg twice in one week so you might say that I am a steak lover. When we walked in, we were seated at the bar right away. We ordered drinks and 15 minutes later, our table was ready. I've ordered my usual which is a salad and New York style steak (medium well) and a baked potato with sour cream. For dessert, cheese cake of course!. Everything from service, to food, to atmosphere was superb.  I will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"Took a couple of coworkers here to thank them for all their work and by all accounts the steaks were good for everyone. Service was nice too - attentive and helpful without being overbearing.  I had a new york peppercorn steak, which was cooked nicely (I ordered medium, I got medium). And the special crab bisque soup was excellent. Creamy and delicious with a few large chunks of real crab. The garlic mashed potatoes weren't fantastic, but they were fine.  Was a little hot near the fireplace where they sat us in the back, but that's particular to that one spot. Didn't order dessert, so can't comment on that.  I'd definitely take folks back here another time - presuming they were meat lovers."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best steak I have ever had !!! I wish there was in in NYC. Steak cooked to perfection friendly staff good food good drink. What else can you ask for. If you love steak this is the place you wanna go to"}
{"text":"I like this location; spacious, convinient location, nice ambiance, and  friendly staff. The menu is standard, same as other keg locations.  The keg classics are good value. I had the Top sirloin keg classic $33 which came with a salad, 8 oz top sirloin steak, side of mushrooms and one of their accomplishments (choices are: twice baked potato with bacon, garlic mashed, fries, asiago rice, baked potato). Salad was standard. Steak was cooked as ordered, veggies and mash were delish, mushroom was nicely done. I enjoyed the meal.  I like their garlic mash and twice baked potatoes; paired nicely with steak."}
{"text":"I just had a birthday dinner here with my brother and sister. Our servers name was Dru, and he was absolutely spectacular. He had great candor, was friendly, and inviting. This location is super accommodating and professional. They honoured my every request and helped me to make my sisters bday special. The food was fantastic and cooked perfectly to our request. Every little bit of food was to die for. Thank you thank you. I will recommend and I will come back."}
{"text":"If I could give this place more than five stars I would! If you're into great steak, chill ambiance, good drinks, and great dessert I would recommend this place! I'm visiting from San Diego, California with my family and we've been on the hunt for some good food in Toronto and decided to check this place out for my birthday dinner. Let's just say my whole family left happy. I ordered the white sangria pitcher to share with a friend and it was a great size... we both got at least three glasses each out of it. So if you're looking to have more than one drink I recommend splitting the pitcher. For dinner I ordered the sirloin Oscar, it was amazing! Everything down to the bernaise sauce with scallops and shrimp to the steak and garlic mashed potatoes was good!!! To top it off I got a complimentary Billie miner pie to end my birthday dinner. It was so good! Definitely something you can share with the whole table as well. We all loved it! I'm also a huge fan of creme brûlée so I was excited to see that they offered mini desserts. So we also ordered mini creme brûlées. It's a great option if you're already super full from dinner but still want something a little sweet after.   Overall, great experience at this restaurant and would definitely make a trip back if I'm ever in Toronto again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this location. This keg does everything right! Friendly knowledgable staff, great food and a very modern interior decor.   The patio is a little small, but they don't have much space to begin with so that's fair. This location (for me at least) is never really that busy, I usually walk right in and sit down. I'm assuming with the competition this location has that's probably why. (I've endured wait times up to 2 hours for a table at the keg a little north of the city.)  At the end of the day this is a keg. For what you pay for a dinner for 2 and an app, you can't really expect much more than the keg provides.. Don't expect 5 star service and food from a 3 star restaurant and you'll fair well here."}
{"text":"The Keg. A Canadian institution.   I popped in here last night for a family dinner, and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal. I'm not one for chains, especially when it comes to meat, but damn it all. The Keg just knows how to cook a steak. Everyone around me went for a separate cut of meat done differently, and everyone practically licked their plate clean. I strayed from the carnivores and had a french onion soup followed by a lobster tail and I have no complaints. The Poutine Of Soups and the King Of Crustaceans are a match made in heaven.   For a chain, this place sure does add up... but with the dark, sleek interior and well-cooked meat, this Keg location is worth the splurge once in a while."}
{"text":"Like others have noted - this place is full of suits on any weekday. I happened to be one of the suits hanging out here on a weekday for lunch, and my experience was a wholly positive one.  The hostesses (yes, all female) are efficient and professional. Despite the other reviews, I found all the service staff modestly dressed and highly courteous; this certainly isn't a seedy sports bar.  My sirloin was done perfectly to medium rare. The sides, however, were a bit lacking - the string beans were bland and the fries tasted suspiciously of the McCain variety. All in all, however, the meat was a winner - and ultimately, that's the point of eating at the Keg anyways.  Make reservations if you want to be seated inside for a weekday lunch. There's first come first served seating in the bar area and on the patio, if that's more of your thing. Note that there are two entrances, so confirm with you're party which one you're going to meet at!"}
{"text":"The keg is known for their great service, and this location didn't disappoint.   We were seated on the patio, where there were heaters to keep us comfortable.    I ordered a prime rib sandwich, and it was very flavorful and delicious, however the prime rib was very fatty - almost half the meat I had to remove because it was just fat and gristle.   The side spinach salad however was amazing."}
{"text":"The keg is a great place to go. When we went in, the atmosphere was booming. Got a nice table next to the fireplace.  Everything was great.  As for our order, I specifically told the waitress that I don't eat pork and that my steak should NOT be wrapped in bacon.  Well guess what?  You got it right.... it came out wrapped in bacon   But they immediately apologized and got me a new entree and comped the entree They were apologetic. Except the my friends felt uncomfortable eating at the table while I waited for my new entree.  But overall. It was great."}
