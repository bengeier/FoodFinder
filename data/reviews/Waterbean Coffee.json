{"text":"Solid local spot with 2 alternative locations in Charlotte Metro.  Good uptown locale which hopefully bodes we'll for future development on the far north side of uptown.  Didn't grab any food, but my mouth was watering at the sight of it."}
{"text":"Great coffee spot with friendly staff and small coffee house accompaniments (e.g. Macarons).  Chill spot and has a great outdoor seating area if you want to enjoy the weather."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy coffee and view of Charlotte skyscraper. Staffs are very nice and friendly. This place is always clean and plenty of seating.  Parking spot however is limited for the store. I parked on the back which was not store parking and got ticket for it. They need to post sign that says back parking are not for customers."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop. It has a great selection of teas and coffees to choose from. The coffee tastes great and the interior is lovely.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ordered lunch.  Be careful,  ordered the croissant sandwich @4.75 with lettuce,  romatoe, pickles,  Mayo,  mustard, oil % seasoning a nd they charged me for a sandwich @6.50. Claimed I had to many condiments.  Sounds like B.S. to me.  WILL NOT BE BACK and will tell others. The cost of greed is no more business ink."}
{"text":"Waterbean is such  great addition to the Charlotte uptown area expecially in the northern part of Tryon street which doesn't get much of attention due to lack to food/entertainment activities around.  Waterbean managed to score a place in what used to be just a parking lot before.  Presence of this coffee shop has drastically improved the vibe of the area and I appreciate the guts of the owners to have boldly made the decision. Amazing selection of coffee, they have a FLIGHT of coffee so you better get you coffee game up!! Ambience of this location was just perfect, it was spacious enough with bunch of tables, bar area, couple sofas, an interesting looking rustic/modern table/bench and a fantastic barista. Food - they have good selection of food items like Banh mi, sandwiches, pastries etc.,  Loved the Baileys Pie bar -  so delicious and not too sweet.  Me lady had an orange scone and it was alright. My latte with caramel and me lady's white mocha was just perfect.  I wasn't sure what kind of coffee went it [forgot to ask :(]  but it was well balanced and soul warming! And they have parking!! imagine parking in uptown (tryon street).  Totally impressed with Waterbean and definitely will visit as often as possible.  oh and they have this distillation flask kind of thing, when I asked the barista about it she said it was for making their cold coffee.  It wasn't functioning at the time though but it looked really interesting and am curious to take a glance of it when working :)"}
{"text":"While the coffee is really delicious and fancy, its pretty expensive. On my most recent outing here, the two lattes I ordered came in at right under $10. With that price tag, Waterbean Coffee is more of a weekend, crosswords and coffee kind of place.   The owners of Waterbean clearly know coffee. If you are a coffee connoisseur, this is the place to go in Charlotte to enjoy your hobby. When you ask for a espresso and the barista responds, \"what kind?,\" you know you are in a serious coffee place. Waterbean has coffee from all over the world, and have properly trained their employees so that each is extremely knowledgeable about their offerings and can make educated suggestions.   The interior is minimalistic and relaxing, chic and modern without being too trendy or \"hipster.\" It is definitely a place wherein you can park your laptop and get some serious work done. And it has a drive-thru for those mornings you are running late or those afternoons when you hit a slump.  Waterbean Coffee is an awesome CLT coffee spot. I will hit it on weekends, when friends are in town, or for a \"I deserve it\" treat, but it is a bit to pricy to be my daily grind...before I hit my daily grind."}
{"text":"Waterbean Coffee is a Charlotte gem!  The staff was very inviting and their recommendations for the espresso flight was perfect!  First time having a BLTS sandwich and I have to ask myself \"what took me so long?\"!!  When back in Charlotte, we will definitely enjoy our Latte, Cappuccino and lunch at Waterbean!"}
{"text":"This establishment is a wonderful addition to the sometimes forgotten North Tryon part of uptown. I finally made my way over here with some coworkers in the afternoon. It was about 3 and there were a few patrons in the beautifully decorated seating area. The front area is clean and appealing and the employees were very friendly and patiently answered all of our questions about their coffees. We just had to try out the syphon coffee and it was quite the show and the end product was delicious! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a nice coffee shop with plenty of drink options, several bakery items for breakfast or snack/dessert time, and what seems to be an affinity for macaroons as they offer upwards of 10 different kinds."}
{"text":"Some of the best coffee that I've had.  The unic Stella di Cafe produces some of the best coffee around.  Great atmosphere for getting work done.  Perfect start to my morning."}
{"text":"Only visited once but I can see this place doing well, especially with the new apartments being built and eventually rented across the street.  The interior is spacious and has a good mix of stool and countertop seating along with lounge style couches and chairs for your use as well.  The service was great and even though they were quite busy, all I saw were smiles and good attitude.  Nice addition to the up and coming north end of Tryon Street."}
{"text":"Cute new coffee spot in a less-frequented part of uptown. My salted caramel latte was delicious and, in my opinion, not overpriced at all. Not sure I'd pay the $3.25 for the pineapple bar again, even though it was tasty. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Get the Large Vanilla Iced Coffee with extra Macadamian nut milk.   You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"When I stepped in, the location was bright clean, and warm. I noticed immediately the inviting couch along the back wall and the colorful macarons on display. It took a moment to get our orders taken but the drinks came out relatively quickly after that. Everything was aromatic and flavorful, although I'm sure I didn't need the extra calories from the flavorings and sweeteners that make coffee and tea delicious and not bitter. Like the coconut milk in the Thai iced tea... yum! My biggest wish here is that the baked goods were more substantial, both in terms of size given cost and health-wise. Can't we have some whole grain or fruity goodness? I don't want to have to get a meal just to be able to snack on something real food-y."}
{"text":"This place is super terrific! Roomy interior, neat, wagon-inspired center table, cool light fixtures.  But, of course, the central theme: THE COFFEE. So good. The drip coffee is brewed to high-quality, though you can also get your coffee made fresh with a pour over or on an aero press. They also have a *siphon* for you cold brew nerds. They also do boba tea (you might know it as bubble tea) - sweet.  Then there's the bakery case - the first time I came in here, I met the woman who makes the cake / brownie treats - they are OFF THE CHART. I tried an Oreo Blondie bar, which was unbelievable, and, at the baker's suggestion, I tried the carrot cake bar. (I am currently eating this as I type on my phone during my second visit.) Super moist cake, nice balance of flavors, not too sweet.  They also have some colorful and inventive macarons. There are already a lot of macaron places in town and, to my mind, nothing can beat Le Macaron in the Metropolitan, but I'll definitely give Waterbean a shot sometime. Finally, they have some sandwiches - and, as I understand it, the banh mi can't be beat.  Anyway, you should definitely check it out sometime. It's the cool new place in town."}
{"text":"Great new coffee shop downtown! Nice selection of wines, beers, and of course your usual cafe drinks. Great array of pastries too. Plenty of seating, music at a nice ignorable volume, and outlets galore! Great place to study or chill if you are Uptown. And you can park RIGHT THERE."}
{"text":"These folks know how to make really good espresso. The food menu is very limited, but the grilled pork sandwich I got was just right for my late lunch. Too much bread, so I ate it without the top. The sandwich had lots of shredded vegetables on it. I am not in town often, but will definitely return to Waterbean."}
{"text":"Yummy coffee and hydro tea ! Very clean and peaceful atmosphere. The cashier was very friendly and knowledgeable about the teas ."}
{"text":"Waterbean Coffee is across the street from my job. Several coworkers who are coffee drinkers go there often (although we get free coffee at work so I was curious as to why).  But since I'm a chai drinker I never visited. A coworker told me to try their chai and I have to say I'm not disappointed. It was not overly sweet and I actually tasted the chai as opposed to a ton of sugar. I also ordered the chocolate cream cheese muffin which was large enough for 3 people!! I will definitely return and since it's across the street from work I will have one on one staff meetings there. They also have a cute outside seating area."}
{"text":"Cute place but I spent $17 on a coffee and a breakfast sandwich. This place is more expensive than Starbucks."}
{"text":"Relishious coffee shop, cool interiors staff and variety of coffee. So much better than the regular Starbucks. Must visit if you are a coffee lover. This is south right at the end of walk uptown Charlotte. Definite recommend and perhaps will be available in most towns if they keep maintaining the quality .... definitely recommend it !!"}
{"text":"Great place to drop in and get some work done.  Free WiFi and a clean and calm atmosphere.  The coffee and treats are good.   The staff is always doing something.  If they aren't helping customers, then they are cleaning. They are very ready to make sure you get what you need, even if it's just the bathroom key!   Their coffee is good.  Dairy free options. Sandwiches are tasty. Hot cocoa is rich and delicious.  All a little overpriced if I'm being honest, but not so much so that I wouldn't go.  I'll still be going at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and tea with offerings. A nice, quiet cafe to get work done at. Also, the building was an abandoned eyesore for years so glad they renovated it and brought it back to life. My only complaint is that you need to ask for a key to use the restroom, which is really inconvenient even though I understand the goal. My recommendation is to use a numeric keypad, so that frequent guests don't have to keep asking for the code."}
{"text":"Tasty and rich americano here and free wifi while I plotted my morning in Uptown. It's a comfy space with good club chairs and a couple of tables plus a counter with stools that goes around two walls. a few tables out front, too! A great way to work with a laptop if that's your thing.  Yes, they also have drive-through."}
{"text":"So cool to be able to get flights of coffee, watch out though, it's a lot! Knowledgeable staff and delicious drinks."}
{"text":"Solid latte, solid bubble tea, decent seating, friendly staff. Nothing was truly awe-inspiring in the visit there, but it was an enjoyable time that I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Yes, the coffee is expensive but you get what you pay for. The owners/baristas know their coffee. But the Uptown location is sooooo worth it. Aside from the fact that there's onsite parking, where else in Uptown (or anywhere else in the city or surround area) are you going to get a full range of delicious Asian goodies, e.g. bahn mi, sizzlewiches, mochi ice cream, mochigatto, Vietnamese coffee, and boba, in a coffee shop?"}
