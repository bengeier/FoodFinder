{"text":"It was ok. They're is a lot put in the Poutine that it is sometimes too much. It can end up making your fries soggy. I had gone when they had just opened so it might have improved but be careful with the combinations, too much may not be better."}
{"text":"After seeing the word \"Poutine\" alone, I knew I had to try it.  The restaurant is very clean, and you are able to see where the food is prepared, which was also very sanitary.   The staff is so polite and helpful.  She had asked if it was our first time there, and she then explained the different choices of potatoes for the fries, sauces, veggies and meats.  We ordered The Club, The Lobster and The Jersey Shore.  Even the regular size, for $11.95 is a huge portion.  I was full and I didn't even get through half of it.  The Club was definitely my favorite one.  The lobster one is amazing but too lemon/peppercorn-ish for me.  I would definitely go back to try their other poutines, but being able to customize your own poutine in so many ways is amazing!  Any poutine lover needs to try it!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations. After all, it's Montreal, it's poutine, it can't and shouldn't go wrong. On the menu board there were about 8-10 poutine combos the restaurant put together. I ordered \"the Chorizo\" and \"the Nacho\" combos, or at least I though I did. \"The chorizo\" was salty and dark tasty with loads of cheese. Very greasy but that's kind of expected with chorizos on top. However \"the Nacho\" turned out to be something else, not what I ordered. It appears to be \"the Pogo\" because it's got cut up Pogo pieces on it, but the rest didn't match what the menu said. It is pickled cabbages/coleslaw. Very disappointing. I would not have ordered this (who wants to eat Pogo/hotdog when there's superior choices to be had?) The cabbage made it smell funny and gave a slightly bitter aftertaste. Not a hit with my kids at all. Before we dug in, the lady at the cashier did offer to change it, but I had distributed it amongst the children already. I should've taken up her offer had I known it would taste like this. Oh well. I think I still prefer the good ole poutine, the traditional kind. You know, just a bed of crispy fries, topped with cheese curds and slathered in some hot meaty brown gravy mess. (Yup, Willie's in Halifax, I'm looking at you.)"}
