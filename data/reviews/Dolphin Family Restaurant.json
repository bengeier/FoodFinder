{"text":"Been to the Oakwood location twice and was impressed with the taste and quality of the food.  However, during my second visit, my son found two strands of hair in his omelette.  I brought issue to the managers attention and recommended she have her servers wear hair nets to prevent other patrons from experiencing this problem. The managers reply, \"This is a new generation, If I asked them to wear hair nets they would all walk out of here.\" Blank stare......Afterwards, I received %10 off my bill and a come again soon... Lol...."}
{"text":"My wife and I along with our son went here today.  It was my first visit. We were seated right away. It was right before 8 in the evening. My son had spaghetti which he  liked. My wife had a chicken stir fry while I had a shrimp stir fry.  Neither my wife or I cared for our stir fry.  The portions were good,but the taste not so. For me it was too much sauce which made for a very salty meal.  We did like the server which made up for the meal. My wife thought there were two many ingredients in her stir fry and that the presentation could have been better.  I did not like the fact that the end parts of the shrimp were on the shrimp.  The shrimp did not taste that good either.  Prices were very good."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here today and it was very tasty. We had a group of 6 from the office and everyone ordered something different and everyone enjoyed their meal. All the food we saw coming out of the kitchen for other tables also looked very good. You get large portions, the menu is large and has all kinds of comfort food.  ***Warning, this is not the correct address!!!***  We drove around in circles for 20 mins on highland looking for this place, it is no where close to this address!"}
{"text":"This place is right down the road from our house. My husband and I are both from greasy diner country where you can get three eggs any way you like with toast for four dollars.  We decided to try this place out after living here for quite a while and wanting some unpretentious breakfast food.  This place was much nicer than most of the breakfast joints back home but with the same straightforward food at good prices.  It is by no means swanky--I thought that the kind of tacky dolphin theme was fun and it felt clean.  The staff was friendly and on top of things without being overly attentive.   I had planned to get the vegetarian skillet without cheese but sometimes I freeze when the server asks me what I would like and just order the first thing I see when I look down at the menu.  I ended up with the breakfast burrito. My husband got the Denver omelette and said it was very good, definitely in the top ten omelettes he has ever eaten.  He liked the option to have toast or pancakes as a side.  My burrito was also good, although not something I would normally eat.  Husband ate half of it and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It had chorizo, peppers, onions, and cheese in it.  Their hash browns were good. Toast came pre-buttered. Unpretentious food, reasonable prices, great service. Will come again."}
{"text":"We usually go for breakfast, which is great. We have been a few times for lunch/dinner, which is only OK.   This is good diner food at a reasonable price.  The portions are large and the service is good.   The pancakes are wonderful, my husband loves them and goes here at least once a week for the pancakes."}
{"text":"We found this place when looking for a place to grab lunch after visiting a nearby national park. The menu includes your classic diner items, but much much more.  My daughter had a salad that included gyro meat and it was delicious.  We live in the Washington DC area, but she says it would be worth the drive back there just for the food."}
{"text":"Was great when it first opened not so good anymore can't get a second cup of coffee to many changes in wait staff"}
{"text":"This is a large family restaurant/diner.  We have gone there for years for standard diner fare.  Always clean, decent portions, decent prices.  Unfortunately,  I took my mother there today and had a simply horrible experience followed by even worse customer service.  I ordered the Greek salad with grilled chicken on it.  It was described as having feta, peppers and olives.  It came out with feta (I think although there was so little it was hard to tell), a carrot slice, tomato, and a sliced egg.  I'm allergic to eggs..  I asked the waiter if I could at least have some olives.  He said they were out of them.  I pointed out that what I got was basically nothing like I had ordered.  He didn't care.  So I ate my chicken, wishing I had known so I could have ordered something else.  No price adjustment.  No apology.  Just tough luck.  My mother was so outraged that she called the restaurant later and talked to Linda.  Linda's response was just like the waiter's: too bad for you, we don't care.  This is so not like the friendly family place it used to be.  New ownership?  I don't know but with attitudes like that who wants to go there"}
{"text":"Went in for break fast after a long night and was pleasantly surprised. Defintely a lot of old people, walkers and canes. But the portion and taste was nothing highly above average but it is breakfast... Well defintely try dinner. Get the country fried steak for breakfast. I'm won over now"}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast . I haven't tried the lunch or dinner menu. the pancakes are awesome and I always enjoy my breakfast."}
{"text":"Terrible generic cheap food.  I guess American traditional is what it is. So if do do not mind McDonalds, the Dolphin  can be considered as fine dining."}
{"text":"Three years later and still am a fan of this breakfast. Huge portions and their Omelets are fantastic.  Great service friendly atmosphere and very reasonably priced. I guess you know its a good place to go to when you see tons of cars in the parking lot.   If you are a huge fan of breakfast check it out!!"}
{"text":"I am very sad that this place had to close the Northfield location is no longer there the location in Oakwood is still opened food is fantastic"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast and their all you can eat fish on Fridays is awesome.  What I have eaten there has been very good and the service has always been good as well."}
{"text":"Great little find for lunch although I ordered breakfast food.  The bacon and cheese omelet was straight up good.  The hit of the meal was the pancakes.  Fluffy deliciousness!  This place has over-the-top tacky, kitschy decor chock full of dolphins and marine life.  So if you can overlook that plus the preponderance of seniors eating there, you will do just fine."}
{"text":"I've stopped in the Dolphin for both breakfast and lunch and both times it has been great! They give you lots of food for an inexpensive price, and the service is quick and friendly. I will be going back again soon for sure."}
{"text":"The Dolphin is a diner and as a diner it deserves 5 stars. It couldn't compete with trendy or sophisticated restaurants but it tops any diner I've visited.  We were a party of three this past Sunday morning when we arrived around 11am. The restaurant was full and there were many patrons waiting, but we discovered they were all large parties. We were seated within 5 minutes.  The hostess was funny. She gave a little attitude but in a real sweet way. Our waitress was snarky but in that diner-friendly way that makes you feel like an old friend and welcome.  I had the Mexican skillet which consisted of chorizo, peppers and hashbrowns covered with 3 eggs (over-easy, my choice). I asked for hot sauce because spicy food is never spicy enough for me. Well I was wrong this time. Wow. Spicy. Water. Quick. I loved it.   One friend had the gyro skillet and the other the corned beef hash. Each were generous portions. All had the option of toast or 2 pancakes (pancakes! unheard of anymore).  The coffee was hot and fresh. The service was good (not great, but hey, it was the Sunday morning rush) and friendly. The prices were reasonable.  I'm not going to bring the wife here for a fancy dinner, but as a Sunday morning diner this place can't be beat."}
{"text":"Slow getting a table with the restaurant only about a third full at best. Sitting at table for now 5 minutes. No server approached yet. Had to ask hostess for some coffee.  Once we got A server. Things went well and food came out fast and was very good"}
{"text":"Decent food. Lots of food for the price. Staff friendly. Fight lots of senior citizens for a seat. But worth it. Salads are huge. Burgers can be huge. Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"An old-time Northfield landmark has reopened this year just down the road in Macedonia. It's a wonderful family restaurant serving great American favorites. Roast chicken, roast turkey, roast pork, corned beef, hamburgers, steaks, chicken-fried steaks, great breakfasts. And more! Service is wonderful. All food is very well prepared and served piping hot (and big portions.) Prices are below-average. Well worth looking for. Be prepared for a slight wait around 6 pm most days."}
{"text":"Went to Dolphin's for breakfast. Food was just mediocre. I had bacon, scrambled eggs w cheese, and homefries with onions.  The homefries were very bland with barely cooked onions piled on top.  My daughter had a meat lovers omelet -the gyro meat and she enjoyed it. Pancakes were okay.  The waitress was the best, very attentive and smiled the whole time. My party and I had a lot of catching up to do and she did not rush us at all.  I think her name was Mandy.  Probably won't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love the country fried steak and eggs best around and always get great service we meet before outings and have large parties they always seat us in a reasonably short time ."}
{"text":"Good food and nice friendly service. My husband and I each had one of the dinner specials. I had the pork tenderloin and my husband had the chicken parmigiana. They give you a choice of soup or salad and serve it with dinner rolls. Their prices are good also. We will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Large menu, great for breakfast, lunch or dinner, Best home fries, great salads, great fried shimp, hamburgers, BLT, Liver and onions are excellent. Large restaurant, cater to seniors with senior menu, wraps are excellent and can't beat the prices compared to other restaurants, nothing fancy, but great food."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast lunch or dinner never had a bad meal here and the price is always right, for the wife and I to eat and eat good the average price is around 18- 23$. Liver and onions are better than Mom's and don't forget the pie on your way out. We go here a couple times a month you just can't be the prices!!"}
{"text":"After much discussion,  my Cleveland girlfriend reluctantly agreed to the Dolphin Family Restaurant for  Sunday breakfast. She stated she had eaten dinner here previously, and was very disappointed. My being from out of town, and having read reviews/ratings from the Yelp community, convinced her to give it another try.   The decor is Dolphin themed. Seems cheesy to me, but not offensive. The theme,  may have something to do with Sea World park having been near here at one time. The restaurant was opened in 1992 and some of it stills feels like that time. This is a place the locals come to. During the time we were there, beginning @ 11:30 a.m., it was steady business, but not crowded and NO WAIT.  As for the breakfast, we both agreed it was super good. Apparently, there are two breakfast menus. (This restaurant needs a website) One goes from opening to 11:00 a.m. It includes items such as waffles and eggs benedict. The second menu, starts at 11:00 a.m. and it includes the skillet options and  omelettes.  I ordered the Mexican  skillet. This was literally a small skillet containing  home fries, chorizo sausage, jalapeños, cheese, onions and 3 eggs. I ordered my eggs over medium and they were cooked perfectly. If you prefer less heat, ask they leave the jalapeños out. The meal also includes your CHOICE OF TOAST OR PANCAKES. Unbelievable! My friend ordered scrambled eggs, sausage and home fries. The 3 sausage links were twice the size of anywhere else I've been. She also ordered both the toast AND pancake as a side. She was charged an additional 73¢ for the toast. We were seriously stuffed after eating this delicious breakfast. ( I ate everything, she had some left over) ;) Our check totaled about $17. Well worth it!!  Forget about Bob Evans and Pancake house, this fare is far better. We highly recommend the breakfast service. My friend was happy she gave the Dolphin another chance.  She even picked up the tab!  BTW, you pay at the counter by the door on your way out."}
{"text":"Love the environment of this restaurant,  great food and desserts!  Great place to take family to out to eat."}
{"text":"The Dolphin, Family owned restaurant, is one of my favorite go to breakfast places in the Macedonia/Northfield area. They serve their breakfast menu all day, but they offer other menu items for lunch and dinner. Their menu is HUGE so I can promise that you will find something.   My go to items are the breakfast burrito or one of their omelettes. They are huge and come with a side of potatoes, PLUS pancakes or toast. The pancakes are very tasty and are one of the staple items. You have to try them.   However, the best part of the Dolphin and why it gets 5 stars is because of the prices. All of the meals run from only $5-$8!!! It's not gourmet, but delicious!   So if you're on a budget or want a delicious breakfast, try the Dolphin!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you. I mean, yes, it is decorated as though my grandma put her knock knacks in there, and my daughter swears it smells a bit like old people, but the food is so good! We've had breakfast here a few times - I keep ordering the eggs Benedict made with corned beef and Swiss. SO GOOD!!! I have yet to order anything I did not like. Our new fave breakfast spot!!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy or pretentious here. Just solid \"family\" food, priced fairly.  It's a go-to place for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"The address in yelp was not correct, it's down the street, so that kinda threw us off. I'd call first to verify. I was interested in seeing the tacky dolphin deco, but was truly delighted by the Christmas deco which was beautiful! The service was fast, friendly and everyone said hello. The food was flavorful and plenty. The portions are reasonably large for the prices they charge. I will visit this restaurant again and recommend it."}
{"text":"This is a very popular restaurant for the after church crowd and senior citizens. The portions are enormous, and the cooking is homestyle traditional.  My husband loves the gyro platter, but I still havent found anything on the menu that \"blows me away.\" They have daily specials, and a HUGE menu.  The dinning room is very large and can be partitioned for groups.  Sometimes there is a wait to be seated."}
{"text":"I had the angus cheeseburger and my wife had the breaded pork chops everything was cooked to order. However our appetizer potato skins was still cold on the bottom. The manager appoligized and quickly made us a new plate the was perfect. All in all we enjoyed the restaurant. It was smartly decorated with ceramic dolphins and the ceiling is domed with a blue ski murial. Very pleasant."}
{"text":"Large portions for a great price. Food prepared quickly. The staff was nice and friendly. I had an omelette, hash browns, bacon and pancakes. The pancake was the best part to me. The omelette wasn't bad but just pretty ok. Address listed in yelp is wrong further down the street. I roamed around the casino parking lot for a while,lol"}
{"text":"We love this place.  The portions are large and a great value.  I love the baby beef liver (yes I said liver).  It's the best I've ever had (sorry Mom).  The fried chicken is good as is the meatloaf.   Their chef salad is amazing.  The chicken noodle soup is always good especially with the garlic rolls that come with dinner. The only thing I don't like is the BLT because it has cheese on it.  Oh, and the desserts are amazing."}
{"text":"This place is great. I come here often. Get the chicken pecan salad. Dont get the gyro skillet. Large portions, very affordable. Good service."}
{"text":"Best pancakes I've ever had... no joke. And im not talking about one of those special pancakes where it comes with all this extra toppings and everything. No I'm talking about regular on the side pancakes just two amazing a flap jacks. I'm hooked, I'm addicted, I need to go back... stupid holidays.  I had gotten the gyro skillet and the amount of food that you got would fill up two people. Lucky for me I'm a big guy. I ate it all. And do not regret it. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We eat here often. Always plenty on the plate, always very acceptable food, always very inexpensive. Why just 4 stars? It is not \"fine dining\" but a very acceptable value."}
{"text":"Good food at good prices. Plenty of seating and the pancakes are the best in town. STEER clear of the steak, they haven't mastered that yet! Definitely a place if your craving a big delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"Hadn't had any dolphin since they changed the tuna nets, so you can imagine how quickly my excitement turned into disappointment when I found out that there was in fact NO dolphin on the menu.  The waitress recommended the open faced roast beef sandwich and I was pleased.  My friends had the veal parm, chicken parm, and a wrap.  All was good.  Portions were very large.  They cater to a mostly senior citizen crowd, so there was very little sodium in the food.  That can be good or bad depending on how you like things.  The place is an old Chinese buffet turned into a diner so the seating is spacious and comfortable.  If you need a place for a large gathering, no problem.  They have a giant room called the \"Dolphin Cove\" and while I was there, there was a party of no fewer than 20 people all at one table.  It looks like it could hold a group of 40 or more.  I wouldn't travel far to go here, but if you're in the area its worthwhile."}
{"text":"Can't see how this place would get four and a half Stars. A friend and I stopped in for lunch one day and we were so disappointed, all the waitress could say was maybe you should try us a different day. It took forever to get our food and they blamed it on only having one cook and a party in the back room that they didn't know was coming in. Really? you had a party of 30 people that you didn't know we're stopping in? Besides that the food was horrible. Never again!"}
{"text":"I love the Dolphin! Super yummy food, really good size portions, and great prices.  The eggplant parm is amazing!"}
{"text":"We decided to go to Dolphin for dinner to see if it's as good as their breakfast. The portions were great! We all had to take home leftovers. I had the roasted half chicken. It was a bit bland, but the stuffing that came with it was outstanding. My daughter had the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken. It was a huge portion & excellent! My son had the breaded chicken sandwich with the BEST fries I've ever tried! My honey had the gyro platter. He said it was really good & only got about halfway through before he was stuffed. I tried the poppyseed dressing on my salad which was very tasty! It was all good, but I'm ready to go back for the fries alone!!"}
{"text":"Good place to get a home style menu. The Liver and Onion is very good and the Fried Chicken bangs!!"}
{"text":"amazing. Went with friends and had fried haddock and french dip. good service reasonable priices and great food.  not sure how they do it however people standing outside were raving about it. if any where near it it is a must stop"}
