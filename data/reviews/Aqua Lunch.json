{"text":"Who ever decided to change the menu did a horrible job. Its become horrible. Who puts cheese in Fish sandwich. Its become very simple and cheap quality. Sorry but they instantly lost 4 customers in one shot. Soooo bad"}
{"text":"Good food for a fast food place.  I have had the Merlan, Salmon, and Snapper and would recommend each one.  The problem is with the service at this location.  The people working here seem to like to go into the back room so no one is there to serve you.   Once I waited at least 4 minutes for someone to come out and take my order, but alas no one came and I left.   Another time the lady was bent over putting things away.   She got up and did not even notice me and went to the back room.   So I no longer patronize this particular Aqua,   but will go to others because the food is good."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I was here and normally the fish and chips are great. Unfortunately this time the fish was soggy and oozing of oil and the potatoes that most likely started off crispy were reheated in a microwave. 

This establishment has been so good in the past I will give them another try. 

--------

Here's that second chance visit and review. Unfortunately there was no improvement whatsoever. It is noticeable that most of the other food shops around them are busy and they are not at all. 

I ordered fish and chips. Again the fish was oozing oil. The fries were undercooked and soggy. I tried. They didn't. Won't be back again."}
