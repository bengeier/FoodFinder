{"text":"Lamp rack main is delicious!...  You can also bring your own wine.   Had. 3 course meal for 35 bucks."}
{"text":"Budget French food that tastes very homely and matched to the same ambience. Small place with great specials and great desserts."}
{"text":"Lovely little bistro with great food and good service (although we were there late, so it wasn't busy). But nice laid-back and intimate atmosphere - plus great vegetarian options!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly, the ambiance good, and the food was tasty!  We had the steak, which was surprisingly tender and tasty. The special of the day was veal, which was very tasty and rich."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. It does not look like much but my pasta was fantastic! I had the seafood fettucini and the flavours were really good! Hearty, flavourful, depth, complexity. Seafood was also delicious. Serving was more than adequate. And best of all, the price was very reasonable, around $13. The Caesar salad looked amazing too. Would definitely come back and try more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious.   Escargots - in tomato sauce, was ok, I prefer it with a creamy or cheesy dressing.  Beef carpaccio - delicately balanced flavours, delicious.  Seafood pasta - had a good rose sauce, not too salty and not too bland, just right.  Profiteroles were very good.  Overall ok-good food, some dishes winning out over others."}
{"text":"Made reservations for winterlicious. Arrived and since there was only 1 waitress plus the manager, we waited a while to be greeted. Went up near the bar to flag the manager and said we had reservations for 2 people. He just walked right past me to deal with another table rather than acknowledge my presence. Finally got his attention and when we asked for a table away from the door since it was so cold he said no and that another free table was reserved for others but so did we and they weren't there yet. He was very abrupt and had a rude vibe. Asked the waitress if another table was free away from the door and she said we could sit at the table by the door and we could move once a table freed up so we did that. After waiting another 10 minutes to at least get our food order in we had enough rude seevice and decided to just leave. Who knows how good the food was but from other reviews you can see they are understaffed and dont make up for that with any pleasantness. Will not be going back there."}
{"text":"Worst place for brunch..I have never had such bad omelette in my whole life..it felt like the omelette they serve at planes for breakfast,very tasteless..our food arrived after 30 minutes although we were the second couple who got in to the restaurant..we ordered americano which was also very bad quality..very disappointed..we will never go back"}
{"text":"I was finally able to go to Winterlicious dinner this year after previous attempts of organizing such events with no luck. What went from 6 people turned into 11 amazing group of friends going to dinner together. Midi is relatively small and cozy bistro but the staff handled our large group very well. The Winterlicious menu was only $25.00 and I would say you definitely get your dollars worth.   As a starter I had the Salad Midi which was nice and light way start to my meal. It was made with mixed greens, prosciutto, asiago cheese, dried berries & pesto drizzle.  But of course, I had to steal from others plates as well. The Crostini was superb as well! For the main, I decided to go with the Fettuccini with Black Tiger Shrimp, Atlantic Salmon, Mussels, Roasted Red Peppers, Baby Spinach in a Rose Sauce. I was slightly disappointed with the main. I wish they had made the salmon and red peppers into bigger pieces instead of blending it into the sauce. The Black Tiger Shrimp was amazing and fresh though. For dessert I had the Profiteroles which is Choux Pastry with Vanilla ice Cream & Hot Chocolate Sauce. It was my first time trying Profiteroles and I have to say I didn't enjoy them as much as I would have liked to. The Choux Pastry tasted somewhat like soggy pancakes because the ice cream was melting and the Hot Chocolate Sauce tasted like store bought chocolate sauce. There was nothing special about it.    Overall, I had a fantastic time at Midi. The service was fantastic. The washroom was kept clean. The portions were great. Definitely will go back but this time with a smaller group or just a romantic date! ;)"}
{"text":"Great little gem! I came in with my co-workers for summerlicious lunch. We got seated in 5 minutes. They had a strange waiting area inside by the washrooms. We liked the choices and the food was pretty good. We didn't come in with very strong opinions but the restaurant turned out to be a great choice. Service was very nice albeit slow. I felt sorry for her as she was the only one serving the entire restaurant! (Including bartending)"}
{"text":"The service was great, even though she was waiting all by herself. My steak was so tender (I like it medium rare and it actually came out that way throughout the steak!) it was such a great atmosphere...it reminded me of Paris. Intimate and quaint."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Absolutely flawless! Georgous, simple, intimate environment. The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star is the place open and closes whenever it feels like it. so no definite opening hours. a few times I've gone there, I had to turn back as they decided to not open that day or close early. Be sure to call and make reservations days/weeks ahead if you do plan to go there."}
{"text":"I had a Buytopia dinner voucher for 2 people with a starter, main, and dessert. The experience left a bad taste in my mouth and that includes the food!   The soup of the day had mostly carrot and little to no peach flavour. I ordered the Beef bourguignon complete with very dry tasting beef pieces. It seemed to have been thrown into the sauce instead of simmering in it.  The creme brulee was rather underwhelming.  The biggest issue was the hidden charges and gratuities added onto the bill for mediocre food. After doing the math, my friend ended up paying double the amount including the Buytopia voucher!  Midi Bistro used to be a great place many years ago for well-made French bistro food especially les moules. with the shady billing practice and sub-par food,  I can see why this place is mostly empty.   If you want good French bistro food, I recommend La Palette, Le Select Bistro or Le Paradis. You will get higher quality food and service."}
{"text":"Awesome rack of lamb and duck confit! But even better the salad with goat cheese and mushroom!"}
{"text":"My friend picked this restaurant out for winterlicious. It's close by her work and was in our budget for dinner ($28).   Yesterday was a cold night so we rushed inside the restaurant to be told our table wasn't ready yet and would be ready for our 7:30 pm reservation. We had arrived at 7:25 pm. The restaurant is small and was full last night. People were obviously in no rush to eat and get out of there as the crowd was joyous and boisterous. Since the restaurant was pinched, my friend and I decided to head to the Krispy Kreme, two shops away so we weren't lurking in the entrance.   When we returned to at 7:30 pm, our table still was ready but we decided to wait at the newly vacant bar and salivate over the delicious smells of the food being eaten around us. Neither one of us had lunch, so we were starving. We were eventually seated around 7:45 pm by our waitress.   My friend ordered the pate, veal chop and creme brule. While I ordered the escargot, seafood risotto, and decided to try a creme brule for the first time.  The escargot and seafood risotto were delicious. My friend's veal chop was good but a bit too sweet for our taste buds. As for the creme brule, it was nothing exceptional. I should've ordered the profiteroles instead.   Nevertheless, we had a lovely night drinking a bottle of their house wine while eating some good food and chatting the night away. Can't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious and service very warm. Very cozy ambience, almost feels like home. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It has been a couple of years since I wrote my original review.  It continues to be a place that draws me in, for all the same reasons  Great food, great service, reasonable prices, and an atmosphere unique and seductive if ( as I do) you love small intimate genuine and good.  We had dinner for the latest time last week.  She practices vegan discipline, and was ecstatic about the eggplant soup and her following Nicoise inspired vegan salad.   I, most assuredly a carnivore, devoured the house pate and followed it with a perfectly prepared and delectable lamb shank.   Wines by the glass were comfortably acceptable in accompanying the food.  In a small place like this the service is often the erratic part, fine or bored when things are slow, overwhelmed and distracted when they are busy. Not here.  Jenna, who seems to be the front of house manifestation of this place, juggles all balls masterfully, no matter what the load. It is not that she does it, but that you don't realize she's doing it until you're walking home and realise that the place went from two tables occupied to all occupied while you were eating, and you never noticed it in the service. All backed up by an awesome kitchen for sure.  This place is one of Toronto's gems. I hate I have to tell you about it. But I do."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick, light lunch at an affordable price!   The atmosphere of the french-style bistro is very welcoming and polished. The service really stood out, the servers were kind and attentive. The food was brought out quickly, we didn't have to wait for more than 15 mins.   The food was good, simple, but maybe a bit underwhelming depending on what you get. We split everything we got between 2 people. We ordered the the salmon quiche, which was probably my favourite. It came with a side salad and we added fries. We also ordered the Mediterranean tartine (sandwich contents on toast) and the Cassolette d'escargots. The tartine was good, but small. The escargots were good, a bit too much like soup for my taste. It was better shared because it has a heavy creamy flavour, too much for one person alone.  Overall, if you're looking for a light lunch at a good price in a nice french bistro-inspired spot, this is a great place to visit!"}
{"text":"Came here with a Buytopia voucher.  French food on a middle of the road budget.  If I'm in the area, I'd come back again, but I'd likely choose another place since there are so many I'd like to try.  Food & service were good.  Very stingy on the bread, my goodness.  We had to keep asking for it, and it got very awkward.  If your dishes have awesome sauces, ask your guests how much bread they'd like, instead of bringing 1 slice per person on each request!  Starters: Escargots - Never had them in a creamy like sauce, but this worked well.  If only I had... more bread!! Would've loved to sop that up.  A bit salty, but who cares.  I like cream sauces.  Salad - Nice dressing.  Can't complain.  Mains: Lamb special - Good stew, decent flavor.  Good sauce.  Guess what I would've liked more of with a sauce like that? Lamb shank - Meat fell of the bone, and the shank was a reasonable size.  We were both full at the end.  Again, had sauce with it, not enough bread!! Grrr.  Desserts: - Upside down apple cake and profiteroles.  Both very solid performers.  Overall, good food, fair prices.  Not every place in Toronto can say that."}
{"text":"I went to Midi Bistro last night for dinner during Winterlicious 2014 for a set course meal with a large group of friends and now I've been coerced, menaced and compelled into writing my first Yelp review. What can I say? Peer pressure works! First of all, a large group is probably not the best way to experience this place. Not that they had any issues handling us, but the bistro is relatively small and the decor, atmosphere, etc. make this place seem more suited to a quiet meal with a few friends or as a date restaurant. They did handle a large group well, however, and the bistro was comfortable, modern, and well kept. Service was attentive and polite. Starter was sautéed mushroom and blue cheese crostini (think bruschetta, but with a lot of mushrooms instead of tomato) and it was surprisingly delicious. I didn't think the mushrooms would be intense enough as a topping, but the blue cheese and other sautéed flavours worked well together with the mushrooms as a base. The main course, and clear highlight of the meal, was pork tenderloin with a sweet mushroom brandy glaze/topping. Usually when I get tenderloin it's cooked with some sort of apple based/or savoury sauce, so I was curious how this would turn out. The sweet topping/glaze was amazing and I'd go back here for this alone: it complemented the perfectly cooked and tender (haha) tenderloin. It made the vegetable mix taste pretty amazing by proximity too.  After a superb main, I was a little let down by the desert. I ordered the profiteroles pastry with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce. The pastry element was tiny and underwhelming...sort of like a soggy pancake. Also, the 'hot chocolate sauce' was more than likely nesquick. Meh. Overall, it was not mind blowing, but the food was all prepared well and I could see myself bringing a date here in the future. WHAT!? No half stars Yelp. Haha, fine. I'd be inclined to go with something around 3.5 stars, but seeing as how this is my first review (and on the strength of the pork tenderloin) I'll round up..."}
{"text":"July 26, 2015  It was Summerlicious 2015 and today was the last day of the event.  I was craving Spanish food but I didn't want us to spend $$$.  Midi Bistro was a good choice bcoz it was close to our place and their prix-fixe menu for dinner was only $25.   We had - Salad Midi that came with smoked duck.  The salad was a regular dish but came with duck. That is a good thing for someone who likes duck and doesn't want to pay much. - Provençal Escargot with sauté mushrooms.   It came with two slices of garlic bread. The sauce was little bit salty but it was good with bread.  This was my first time having snails!  It tasted like mussel. Interesting!  Oh! And I counted it..there were four snails in the dish haha :D  I like it though. - Seafood pasta.  At first I wanted to have Seafood Risotto but I changed my mind.  I felt like having pasta today :) The fettuccine and vodka sauce was tasty but the size of mussel made me disappointed.  They were very tiny!  You can't even see the mussel inside except the shell (--\") This must be because of the special price on Summerlicious I assume. However, Shrimp and Scallop were ok :) In average it was good. - Faux-filet grille.  The steak came in garlic vermouth sauce and sun dried tomato butter.     I personally don't eat beef at all so I can't really tell how steak is.  The opinion was based on my husband.  He ordered medium for the steak.  He said it was ok. - Vanilla cream brulle and Peach with vanilla ice cream. They were our desserts.   Service - Only one server took care of the whole restaurant.  I'm not sure if it's normal here or they are short of staff.  However, she did a good job.  She knew how to handle it.  The restaurant  - The restaurant is small size.  The tables are very close together.  It's cramped. Customers definitely need reservations ahead of time."}
{"text":"I've been here enough to say that the SERVICE will ALWAYS SUCK if its busy because they can only afford one waiter/waitress.  So go when its NOT BUSY so they can give you all thr love and attention you deserve (like please refill my water instead of me trying to track you down like a starving predator and begging you to do so when you serve me something drier than sand).  If you're going in big groups they won't tell you ahead of time that they include gratuity.   THE FOOD WILL TAKE AN HOUR OR TWO HOURS TO ARRIVE when over 3 people.   Food is consistent but I can only say that around 75% of their menu is great, the others are mediocre and worse than  non edible.  What I do recommend as a must get on a first impression:  Pate De Campagne Penne Rosa Seafood Pasta Risotto Aux Champignon Carre D'agneau  What can be ok:  Saumon A La Canelle Risotto Vegetariens Escargot"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I've been here once before for a regular dinner at this small bistro and while the service was slow, the food was excellent.  Yesterday, the place was closed down for a private function... mine!  My wonderful friends booked it for my bridal shower lunch and we had this restaurant all to ourselves.  So much love makes me a bit bias, but I truly have to say that this place does deserve its five stars.  The atmosphere is intimate and warm.  We had very attentive and friendly service.  The menu for the lunch included an appetizer, a main, dessert and coffee or tea.  There were about four choices for each category so there was bound to be something that everyone liked.  I got the pate for appetizer and a 'ploughsman' plate of proscuitto, pate, and salad.  Little did i know that the ploughsman plate was actually very much like the pate appetizer (had the same pate), but since it tasted so good, I didn't mind so much.  I got to sample my mother's spot on and very filling roasted red pepper soup as well.  For dessert, I had the creme brulee which along with the coffee was the perfect end to the meal.   I would highly recommend MIDI for both regular dining and private functions.  Parking is plentiful on the streets and in the lots surrounding the area."}
{"text":"Came here today for a summerlicious lunch.  The service was extremelyyy slow.  The waitress poured us some water after we already finished our apps.  I started with the midi salad and the portion was SO small.  legit it filled half a side dish plate that you eat your bread on.  For the main I had the Mediterranean Oven Roasted Eggplant Caviar, Roasted Red Peppers Sandwich.  Sounds amazing, but believe me, it is NOT.  The eggplant puree was cold, there were like 3 tiny strips of red pepper on the top, and it just looked gross. Dessert was parched pears with ice cream.  meh.    Also, after going to Paris earlier this year and having the most phenomenal quiche,  I retract my previous review that this place has the best quiche.  It is NOTHING at all like what a real quiche should taste like. Midi Bistro you do not know french food."}
{"text":"The service was rushed and rude and the food didn't really make up for it: Myself and two girlfriends went out for summerlicious; it seemed like a great menu for a good price so we made a reservation. I came 10 minutes early and was happy to wait for my reso, but then found that the staff thought we had made a reso for 2- there was no apology, instead they showed me a tattered book where our name and the number 2 was written. There is zero chance I made that mistake and I told them that; I was then seated and waited for my friends to arrive. One arrived at 6 and the other at 6:05 but not before the same staff came at 6:04 asking when the rest of the party would arrive because we are on a timed schedule. We reminded him we were 4 minutes into our \" scheduled time\"....and the restaurant was empty. The meal was ok- great portions, very tasty, the rest of the staff was polite but again- as one staff left us with the bill and we reached for our credit cards- the same problem waiter rushed over and asked us to finish up because there were people waiting for this table. Like HELLO WE GET IT WERE LEAVING. So aside from that dude who was hit a little to intense it was an average restaurant"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and the first time was better than the last.  Their Winterlicious and Summerlicious menus are not too experimental.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they don't change that much.  In July I had this amazing beef stew that had fruit in it.  Oh.EM.GEE it was the best thing I've had in a long time.  I like the cute, cafe feel.  In February I had a poached pear for dessert that I literally had to dig at while it melted ice cream all over the place.  So there can be some misses (we're all human, right?).   I def. recommend going, especially if you are going to a play at the Four Seasons Centre or seeing something at the AGO.  They are really quick.  Be prepared for some French 'tude, though.  I was so stuffed I couldn't finish my stew and he asked what was wrong.  I politely told him I was full but it was delicious and I'd love to take it home but I was going to the theatre.  He starred at me blankly and said \"if it was so good, why did you not finish?\"  All part of that French cafe experience, it is worth it."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Thursday night. It was almost empty but we couldn't understand why - the food was delicious, especially amazing for the price. We had escargot and salad for starters: great portions, and delicious. For mains, 2 of us had the steak, one had the tajine, and one the short rib special - all fantastic, but the special was the best meal: definitely should be added to the permanent menu. For dessert we had the walnut cake and the profiteroles. Both yum. Waitress was very friendly and helpful. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"There are many better, similarly priced, French restaurants in town, and many better non-French restaurants around the corner. In the 10 years since I was last here this place has become frayed at the edges and slack on quality. Today I ordered the burger - instead of coming out on brioche bun it came between two pieces of (shortly-thereafter soggy) brown toast. No explanation. Shredded cheese only half melted. They did offer something else but didn't have time to wait while my lunch guest ate. Sole remedy after that was free espressos. Not unreasonable but not what I expected given my disappointment with the burger. It wasn't the only issue though - food is all around just ok, chairs and tables are rickety. I usually love little French bistros and want to love this place again - but sadly can't. I'd probably give 2.5 if I could but it's not worthy of a 3. Time for an update Midi."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom and a friend who was visiting from overseas. I thought it would be a nice place because my previous three dinners here over the years have generally been good. However, it seems that the portions have shrunk and the quality of service has gone down significantly. It was a Tuesday night, and maybe they didn't expect a full house, so there was a single waiter serving the entire restaurant. This meant that we had to wait 20 minutes just to place our orders, and we waited another 20 for our apps, another 20 for our mains, and another 20 for our desserts. The bill, you guessed it, took another 20. The waiter was running around as quickly as he could, and we thought he was a good sport until we settled the bill and he asked if we needed change. When we said yes, his attitude went from professional to curt. When he returned with our change, he very rudely announced our exact amount of change, as if to imply that we are too cheap to give him a 40% tip, which is what we would have given him had we not asked for change. For the mediocre quality of service, the excruciatingly long wait time, and that rude comment at the end, he definitely did not deserve a 40% tip. The saving grace was the food. Despite that portions are less generous than I remember, the lamb shank and pork were very tender. My mahi mahi, on the other hand, was overcooked and dry. Flavour was still good. As much as I used to love this restaurant, I'll have to think twice next time about coming here."}
{"text":"Summerlicious, fifth and final round!  I have a hunch that people are too nice to tell me that they think I'm crazy when I explain how I make my list of 'licious options...and it's quite possible they're right.  Without going into the details here, when I made that list, I should have known that including a restaurant offering duck on their menu meant that I was definitely going to that restaurant with the boyfriend (aka the duck fiend).    We arrived in a very small restaurant...It had about 10 tables in all.  But it was cute, and I enjoyed it.  I do have a soft spot for anything French though so I'm slightly biased.  We were seated at a prime table by the window and presented with the menus.  I didn't notice until later but, strangely, some of the ingredients on our menus were not what was described online.  For example, the MIDI salad didn't have pine nuts, it had walnuts (if memory serves me, but it definitely wasn't pine nuts).  Also, the duck was served with a blueberry sauce instead of a mustard sauce, which if you ask me is a pretty big difference.  Personally I'm not a big fan of sweet sauces on meat, most of the time.    For appetizers, I had the salad and my date had the soup of the day - dairy free mushroom soup.  The salad was HUGE, a full size plate full.  It was very tasty though.  I didn't hear any praise or complaint regarding the soup.  For the mains, I ordered the fish of the day which was Marlin with a raspberry sauce.  Surprise of surprises, boyfriend ordered the duck.  The Marlin was very tasty, and I even liked the raspberry sauce.  The duck was also very good, but he didn't seem to like the blueberry sauce very much.    For desserts, the orders were crème brulee for me, and profiteroles for him.  The crème brulee was described as vanilla and cardamom.  Admittedly, I don't know exactly what cardamom tastes like, but I didn't taste any more flavour than usual.  Even the vanilla wasn't that strong.  It did have a nice crisp top, but the crème itself wasn't quite as thick as I usually prefer it.  The profiteroles went over very well.    All in all, a very cute little restaurant with pretty good French food."}
{"text":"Winterlicious round 2 tonight at Midi Bistro. Had been here for Summerlicious as well - funny enough, the exact same menu. The service was pretty standard, nothing spectacular. There was one server and as it got busy he became less attentive. The service was slow. The bread that was served was cold (a pet peeve of mine) but delicious.  Midi is a very small restaurant - maximum seating capacity is probably about 25 people.   I went with my family in tow. We ordered the escargot, Midi salad and soupe du jour (roasted red pepper) to start.   The roasted red pepper soup was very tasty. A fiery taste from the roasted red peppers with a hint of acidic tomato flavor. A great way to warm up from the chilly weather! The escargot were very yummy basking in a mushroom cream sauce. It was not greasy which was a nice departure from the oily, rubbery escargot from other dining establishments in Toronto. The escargot were very soft, not like the usual rubbery slime you'd get.  The Midi salad was served up with mixed greens, prosciutto, walnuts and vinaigrette. I found the saltiness of the prosciutto to be too overpowering. The vinaigrette however was very nicely done.  On to main courses... We had the confit de canard and poisson du jour, which was a cod provencale.  The fish was very tender and flaked off the fork with ease. The provencale sauce kind of tasted similar to my roasted red pepper soup lol. The vegetables were really tasty. It came with green beans and another pale yellow vegetable that tasted like bamboo shoot... I should've asked what it was.  The duck was perfectly seared and had a really nice roasted taste to it. The meat did melt off the bone, but not as tender as duck confit I've had in the past.   The desserts were a little disappointing. We ordered the profiteroles, Creme Brulee as well as Poached Pears.  When I think of poached pears, I think warm and soft. The poached pears at Midi were not poached to perfection. In fact it wasn't poached long enough. I had to fully attack it with my spoon to finally eat it. It was served with vanilla ice cream. A good poached pear should consist of a slightly warm pear that would melt the ice cream to make the flavors mesh together. The profiteroles were also a disappointment. The choux pastry was horrible. Not light and airy but hard and dry. Their profiteroles are also made with ice cream - not the soft, melt-in-your-mouth creamy centre. I would've enjoyed a frozen President's Choice one just as much. The only thing that was good about this dessert was the chocolate fudge sauce.  Finally the Creme Brulee, again disappointing. Not creamy or smooth enough for my liking, and bland.   The coffee was pretty good. Bold and intense coffee flavor. However, they didn't have any cream left so that was a downer. All in all, good value for what you pay but that's not really saying much. Perhaps I will try the restaurant again when Winterlicious is over. Their food is great, but next time I'll go elsewhere for dessert... And coffee."}
{"text":"'I want a light red, elegant and earthy' 'How about the Sauvignon blanc'  ? Calls itself a wine bar!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a very cozy and laid-back French restaurant. The server was relaxed and very friendly. The French Onion soup was mediocre - it did not have enough cheese, and the bread added to it had some unusual seeds - possibly flax - which clearly did not belong. This was followed by Dijonnaise mussels and fries. These were excellent! The Dijon sauce was incredible, and the portion was generous. The fries were crispy and accompanied the mussels appropriately. This certainly made up for the relatively poor onion soup.   It's surprising that a place like this doesn't serve bread before the meal is brought.  I would come back to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Came here for Summerlicious with a large group for a farewell lunch today. We were 14 people in total and another large group of 12. There was only ONE waiter serving the entire restaurant and it showed. He didn't smile once and was running around like a chicken with his head cut off. Unfilled water glasses, ignored patrons at the door, and the like. As you can imagine, it didn't leave a good taste in my mouth as a regular of Midi. I've probably been here more than 6 times.   My favourite part of the meal is the fries, but they were skimpy on the portion this time around. Also, they ran out of the salmon quiche and the guest of honour had to change her order. I don't understand why they don't just make more! This happens to us EVERY time we go!   The good: The pate appetizer was delicious and so was my open faced sandwich (Paris-Lyon-Marseille) a tad dry. Some extra mayo solved that problem (too bad I couldn't flag down the waiter until half my meal was over) and the mayo was also the perfect accompaniment to my fries. Raspberry sorbet for dessert. All the desserts here are amazing, so make sure you order one. The Caesar and Nicoise looked incredible (good portions and quality ingredients). Really, the well-made food saved the service for me this time.   I suggest that the owners plan better for busy lunch days especially when there are two large groups with reservations at the same time."}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious. We arrived right at opening and asked the server questions about menu items. Unfortunately she was uninformed and ran back to kitchen several times in order to get answers. I ordered appetizer of warm mushroom salad...got the salad but no mushrooms. Mushrooms arrived separately 5 minutes later in a bowl...I guess the kitchen staff meant me to combine into the salad myself. Mushrooms arrived cold and frankly seemed to be canned. My friend ordered the Moules in white wine and said she has definitely had better. Service staff asked me 3 times for my dessert order & 3 times I requested creme brulee...then for some reason a plate of ice cream was placed in front of me! My friends ordered the profiteroles and said they were stale. What more can I say, glad we didn't pay full price. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on the way to that momo sushi place and saw it was summerlicious, so decided to pop in.   Going on, I got the vibe that it's French/Italian, mostly because j'ai vu un mur couverte avec un poème or something like it. The menu itself has French names but it was mostly pastas in the entrées so I guessed it was some fusion thing.   This is definitely a cute date spot. Tables don't hold more than 4 and the dining area is tightly packed and dimly lit but I guess it adds to the romantic ambience.   I had this prosciutto salad with mixed greens and asiago cheese and it was fantastic. I'm not a salad person but this was a great appetizer. I loved that they didn't drown the salad in their dressing... Which I still can't figure out. It was light green with bits of herb in it. Anyway, they didn't give too much prosciutto but it was delicious. They sprinkled some walnuts in there, which didn't stand out too much but I guess walnuts are just mild.   My entrée was seafood pasta. It has tiger shrimp, calamari, and a couple of other stuff. When I went yesterday, they didn't give too many toppings. I don't know if it's because we ordered two.. Not that that should matter. However, that rosé sauce was great!   My dessert was a crème brûlée but an herb they added on there was too gingery. The sugar coating on top is really thick so you really have to your weight into breaking it up. I probably burned more calories eating the crème brûlée then ingesting it because it took so much energy to bite!   Service was nice and friendly. The ambience is top notch but I think they need to tweak their food a bit. I had some of their peach and ice cream and that was good, though! Taste is all there, but I'd have liked more toppings in my pasta. The pasta was chewy which I liked."}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars. Came for Summerlicious lunch today with a party of 6. Note: They ONLY have -licious menus available for lunch, i.e. no regular menus.  I had no trouble making a reservation one day in advance unlike at other nearby -licious restaurants, which might say something about either Midi's (lack of) popularity or tendency to overbook. The latter is probably the case since the place was packed around 12:30PM and since tables are relatively close together, it felt a bit claustrophobic, but manageable.  We were actually all pleasantly surprised by the Summerlicious food! The pasta/risotto mains were big portions, which we weren't expecting. And we all adored the pastas (seafood, vegetarian, vegan) and seafood risotto... Even the Italian in our group ;) The scallops were said to be amazing, very fresh and tender, though not big. The appetizers were A-OK with the vegan soup of the day (gazpacho) being fairly large and very refreshing and cooling, but the salad appetizers were disappointingly small and lacking in variety. The prosciutto in the salad received some love, again from our Italian friend, as it was particularly lean. The desserts were very meh, but the creme brulee was well-received.  Vegans, have no fear as Midi can accommodate you, particularly if you notify them in advance when making the reservation! I had my main modified to be vegetarian pasta with tomato sauce rather than pesto white sauce. I got more creative with the dessert, as all the options contained dairy, to substitute raspberry sorbet for ice cream, keeping the peach (comes from a can, kind of disappointing), and omitting the chocolate sauce.  Service- 3.5/5. Very nice and accommodating (clearly, as they were able to make great adjustments for this vegan here who stupidly came to a French bistro), but slow and unobservant. We never got water refills and 2 of our guests waited so long to receive cutlery and waters. Food came relatively fast though, but expect to spend 2 hours here for -licious."}
{"text":"Came for here Winterlicious dinner on a Friday with my dragon boat friends. I made a reservation for about 10 people but had to keep calling to change the reservation. The owner didn't seem to happy that I kept changing the number of people. When we arrived at the restaurant, I didn't realize it was that small. To fit a table of 15 proved to be difficult. It worked out in the end as my some of my friends were running late but they managed to clear the tables to finally sit the 15 of us together. It felt slightly rushed but I totally get that the owner was trying to move the reservations along so he wasn't backed up. Everyone ordered different dishes. For the appetizer, I ordered the escargots. The best part of my dining experience was definitely these escargots. It was very creamy and delicious. I would love to have eaten way more and have eaten a whole bowlful of it. For the entrée, I ordered the Moroccan Beef Tajine- Diced Beef Slowly Braised in a Root Vegetable, Mushroom, Dried Fruit & Red Wine Sauce. It was quite delicious, flavours were good and they a pretty good portion of the beef. My other friends ordered the lamb shank and thoroughly enjoyed that dish.  For dessert, I got the crème brule to finish off a delicious meal. Despite the large group size, the staff managed to do separate bills. For a 3 course prix fixe menu at $33, I thought it was worth it. Delicious food and good portions throughout the meal. Overall, despite some minor things, we still managed to have a positive dining experience. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch and I love it! It is an excellent winterlicious option!   Food : I've had the seafood risotto and the duck confit. Both are amazing. Duck came with lots of greens, as did their tartine, which a friend ordered.   Service : \"leisurely\" but very polite  Ambiance : cozy, feels very boutique, I think it would impress a date without trying too hard!"}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious and I found the food to be really good! I especially enjoyed my dessert - profiteroles with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce! There were a few things that I wasn't too thrilled about though - I found the restaurant to be very tiny and cramped. Conversations were somewhat awkward since I was sitting directly next to another customer. I also didn't find the risotto very filling which was a bit of a shame since I found it to be quite tasty! My overall take on Midi - good food with great prices!"}
{"text":"Most memorable feature: Lovely service  Midi Bistro never fails to impress me.  Came for summerlicious dinner with a few friends and we had very attentive servers.  The food is always consistently good and the atmosphere is what you would want from a French bistro in Toronto.  Come with an open mind and reasonable budget, and you'll be pleasantly surprised.  Dishes ordered: Pâté de Campagne, Salade Midi, Cassolette d'Escargots, Rôti de Canard Muscovy Confit, Veal Chop, Veggie Pasta, Crème Brûlée, Profiteroles, Peach Melba"}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious and really enjoyed it! The vibe was very laid-back and friendly, it was the perfect type of style for a small and intimate restaurant.  Had the Winterlicious Prix Fixe menu. Everything was very good, but the veal chop was particularly excellent...! Service was excellent also, as our table was not ready when we arrived but the staff was very apologetic and took care to keep us in the loop.  The only odd thing about this restaurant is that it's apparently named after a region of France, and not the MIDI digital music protocol. This would make perfect sense if not for the fact that the restaurant sign is nearly identical to the MIDI logo?! Check it out if you're a musician, you will laugh.  Whoever designed the sign either has a sense of humour or did not feel like working super hard that day. :)  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner after an AGO Exhibit on a Saturday.  Food: not fresh, frozen vegetables, slimy fish  Service: Unprofessional: waitress made intrusive comments to my husband and I. We were both taken aback by her unprofessional behavior and felt very uncomfortable afterwards.  Ambience: Besides the underpar food, and rude waitress  (inappropriate conduct), the deco and design of the place was cozy and quaint.   Will not go back if it was complimentary or recommend this place to anyone. Too many good restaurants in TO that serve decent food and have pleasant servers to waste your time and money at MIDI BISTRO.  I give it a 1 star for ambiance. The food and service get a ZERO rating."}
{"text":"after previous attempts to go to Midi for the past two summer and winterlicious 2013, I finally made it! Tucked away in Toronto's Baldwin Village, Midi Bistro may be not be fancy from the outside, but it has the ability to wow you with some of their popular French cuisines.  What started out as a reservation for 4, soon turned into 11 hungry individuals! The overal ambience gives you a sense of comfort, cozyness...much like a bistro!  The food is overall 4/5, here's the scoop based on the winterlicious menu:  Cassolette D'Escargots 4/5 served with a mushroom basil creme sauce, this small starter is delighful. The rich creme compliments, but doesn't overpower the taste of the escargot which is the real deal! would have been perfect 5!! but I think the escargot had some left over shells I was chewing on..hmmm..   Grilled Angus Striploin Steak: 5/5 Prepared Medium rare, kudos to the chef for cooking it perfectly! The garlic butter served with the steak heightens the taste of the steak as well adds versatility to the overall dish.  The lightly blanched beans craddling the steak adds level of freshness and overall presentation to the dish! well done! tres bien!  Poached Pears with Ice cream: 4/5 Though it was my first time having poached pears, not big fan however it was something different than the usual creme brulee..   Would I come here!! oui! great place, its small, and intimate...the servers were accomadating as well.  Great experience overall."}
{"text":"It was ok. Decided to try a French restaurant on my own. Tried escargot,duck confit and poached pear with ice cream.Not sure if everything was seasoned (maybe the French way of cooking) but I would say that the vegetables were very fresh, the duck was moist and the blackberry sauce was a nice touch to it. The waiter started to get busy but he had everything under control from my point of view. Will be back...maybe bring a friend along with me."}
{"text":"We parked on McCaul and walked up to a quant little place. I had to admit, I was expecting a slightly better place by the way they sounded when we made the reservation for 5pm. We were told that we should be on time as there were other reservations at 6:30 for our table. So we walked through an old school style door. We saw our friends right away as the place was so small, that it held about 8-10 tables. The decor was a vintage looking french cafe. We sat down and proceed to quickly look over our menu for the night. I had chosen the soup de jour as the starter and the chicken supreme for the main course. The pear dessert had seem to sound a little more special compared the other ones, which were kinda the norm, such as the creme brûlée. Our starters came and the soup tasted pretty good, but a little on the starchy side. My other friends found their starters to be tasty. At this point a cold drafty wind came through our table as other guests arrived. The staff quickly cleared our plates as we were done and our next courses came not too long after. One of the ladies had ordered the steak and the other ordered the Tilipia fish, we all shared to taste the different dishes. I really liked my chicken supreme and the tilipia dish, but I found the steak to be a little mediocre. Not so much the taste, but the quality grade of the meat. Again we felt the cold draft of the door, the fact that the top section of the enclosure between the two doors was not enclosed probably contributed to the lost of heat and cold drafty wind. Anyway we did enjoy our main course and moved on to dessert. When dessert came, I was a little disappointed, the dessert was very simply. It was a poached pear with some ice cream and chocolate syrup. Mind you, it was very good, and although I enjoyed my dessert despite being disappointed by its image. The feelings were a little mixed across the table, but overall we enjoy the meal and service that was provided. I give this a rating of 2.5-3 out of 5."}
{"text":"I love coming to Midi Bistro not only because of the food but also for the great service!  I have tried their regular menu as well as the 'Licious menu. The place is small but homey and reminds you of a French bistro.  For appetizer, you MUST try their Cassolette dEscargots. This is sauteed Snails in Basil Cream Sauce. The taste is extra-ordinary,  you won't even notice you're eating Snails.   They also offer one of the best melt in your mouth Osso Bucco in Toronto.  Don't let the other reviews stop you from trying this restaurant. I already dined at this restaurant three times and the service and wait is not that bad. Plus the servers are nice and friendly even under stressful conditions."}
{"text":"They clearly overbooked the restaurant for Winterlicious.  I was forced to seat so tight that I got a muscle cramp.  Eating here was like eating on a full bus: there are people sitting everywhere, and some are standing right next to you waiting for their chance to sit.   Foodwise it was average, except creme brulee was clearly premade and just taken out of a fridge."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on October 21st at 6:30PM for the first time with a Buytopia voucher.   My wife had a mushroom and leek soup to start which was good. 4/5. I had the escargot in a cream sauce to start which was also very good, albiet too salty. The escargot were not overcooked and the mushrooms they were served with were great. 4/5.  We both had the lamb shank for our entrees. It was tender and a good size and both the shank and sauce were good. It was served with vegetables and fries (frozen not fresh fries, but tasty, very similar to McD's). My only reservation was that the entire dish with the exception of the fries was lukewarm. It was as if it had been sitting out for at least 15 minutes prior to being served for us (or not reheated properly if it was previously cooked). I would order it again granted it came out hot. 3.5/5.   We both had the tarte tatin for dessert. It was great. 4.5/5  On a food basis we both agreed we would come back again without a voucher. However when we went to pay the server told us he could not accept our voucher as we did not tell him prior to ordering that we had one. We clearly told the man we spoke with on the phone 3 hours earlier when making the reservation that we had a voucher. The instructions on the voucher are as follows:  Instructions: 1) Call merchant for appointment or availability 2) Print out voucher and bring to establishment 3) Present to the cashier when ready to pay 4) Remember to tip on original value 5) Enjoy!  Not only did we tell them ahead of time (which is not a requirement per the voucher), we followed the instructions on the voucher itself. In the end after an argument and waiting five minutes the server decided to honor it.   The last thing that really added to our poor service was the server putting an automatic 15% gratuity on our bill based on a bill price of $89 (the \"full price\" quoted on the coupon). The regular price for our prix fixe menu that night was $25 each as it is a Monday - Tuesday special for a total of $50 + tax. Given the poor service I would have tipped less than $13 but I was not in the mood for a second argument.    NOTE TO MANAGEMENT: Don't argue with customers who are likely trying out your restaurant for the first time (especially when they are right). Secondly, don't put an automatic gratuity on a party of two, especially after giving poor service. We would have come back without a voucher but you've now lost our business forever; very shortsighted."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came here for the second time for one of our farewell lunches. I love this little restaurant.  Off of Baldwin Village, Midi is a wonderful French restaurant that serves excellent salad, tartines (open faced sandwiches), and quiches.  I had ordered the Eastern tartine the first time, which was delectable.  This time, I had ordered the Countryside tartine (prosciutto, spinach, dijon mayo, and pesto) with both the salad and fries.  Absolute must have as well.  Midi has this excellent orange vinaigrette that goes with the salad, which isn't too strong nor too light.  Fries are good too - however, it reminded me a lot of McDonald's French Fries (and I'm not complaining!)  A lot of my coworkers recommend the Midi Caesar salad - guess I'll have to try that soon time.  Definite recommend.  The great thing is that they also accomdated about 9 of us today, and the food was still served on time. I was quite impressed."}
{"text":"I went there for summerlicious.  Hours is misleading.  It says 11:30-10:30pm at the door.  I got there at 4:45.  My fault for not calling, assuming it's non-peak hour.  They're not open until 5pm.  I was willing to wait.  Call them and they need reservation.  Then, hang up on me.  Poor attitude.  Waste of time.  And update your hour."}
{"text":"My first time here, went with two friends. Location is understaffed for an event like Winterlicious. It didn't make sense to me that a second waitress later arrived to start her shift when the lunch rush was already over. One waitress being the hostess and looking after all those tables which some included large parties of people, it doesn't work. People are kept waiting even when they were on time in their reservation. If others were late to their's, like not by 5 minutes but by 15 minutes or so, it doesn't make sense to give them their reservation and make the people that came on time have to wait longer. People that go out of their way to be punctual should be rewarded.  After we got seated, we had to wait another 10-15 minutes just to have the menu in front of us. It is a waste of time, by that time we would have decided what to order. It doesn't take too long to bring us these mere paper menus, if you gave it to us, we'd be out of your way for the next while, while you can tend to other customers. I get it though that there's only one waitress, but that's on your end and not our's. I saw one chef come out, so I know at least there's one guy in the kitchen cooking. When there's a menu item that's not available for the day 'cause it's sold out, then you should say so when giving the menu to us so that we know not to choose it. My friend who chose that dessert had to think about it and pick it again.  Food took a while to come out, we were all pretty hungry. However, it was worth the wait 'cause it was good and the time in between each course coming out was just right. Not in a rush but not too long in between. It was well paced and there was no rush for us to leave either, as we like to take our time. Eating out is an experience. One thing though, I didn't want the fries that came with my main course and asked if I could substitute it with something else. Waitress flat out denied it. Too blunt. I've been a waitress before so I don't believe you can't do something about it. I'm not telling you to alter the dish, but what I asked was to change one of the sides on my plate which took up one third of it, you could have at least asked the kitchen and pretended. So I'm not pleased with the lack of accommodation, it could have been better.  For appetizer, I had homemade French country style pate, toast and gherkins. My friends had roasted butternut squash soup. Both were decent. My main course was Mediterranean Quebec chevre, roasted eggplant caviar, roasted red peppers, open sandwich on toasted country bread served with garden salad. I liked it, would give that four stars. My friend had Nicoise: tuna, hard boiled eggs, French beans, red skin potatoes, roma tomatoes, black olives and roasted red peppers. The tuna was shredded and looked identical to the canned tuna in stores, however, it was fresh. Another friend had the seafood pasta: fettuccini with black tiger shrimp, bay scallops, roasted red peppers, baby spinach in a white wine rose sauce. I think that one was really good. For dessert, I had poached pears served with vanilla ice-cream and chocolate sauce. I think it was the best course of the meal and deserves five stars. It is very cold to eat ice-cream in the winter, but I don't regret the choice. Each part of the dessert was equally good, the pear had a bit of crunch to it but was still soft, the ice-cream was very creamy which was better than I had expected because vanilla ice-cream had sounded plain and the chocolate sauce was the best topping. My friends had vanilla and cardamom creme brulee, which was good also but I liked the pear dessert better.  Overall, I'd say it was a positive experience. I would come again if anyone ever asked me to, but I don't think anytime soon. I like the fact that this place offers vegetarian options. Lunch is $18CAD for Winterlicious not including taxes and gratuities, so it's a way to try French cuisine for a low cost."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  It's not everyday where you can find an excellent French restaurant in Toronto at a relatively affordable price.  Midi Bistro is a French-style bistro on McCaul Street, within walking distance of UT and OCAD. If you wanna try French food for a lower price than places like Auberge du Pommier, this place does the job well. The ambience screams French, as well as many French words inside the bistro itself.  Their lunch specials are at a maximum price of $15, so it's definitely great value for what you get. The portions are reasonable as well, so you will likely be full once you finish. I came with my dad and ordered a french onion soup, escargots, seafood pasta, and steamed mussels with tomato sauce and a side fries.  The food surprisingly came out quick (although we were the only people eating there at around 3pm on a Tuesday). The french onion soup was very cheesy and had an excellent onion flavour, however the bread didn't melt in with the soup very well as it was still a bit hard. Everything else, however, was excellent, including the escargots, seafood pasta, and the steamed mussels with tomato sauce. I didn't end up eating the fries as I was full.  Service was excellent and efficient. I definitely think despite some reviews questioning about pricing, their lunch menu is of an excellent value. I would recommend  this to those with an under $20 lunch budget, and personally I will return next time I'm back in Toronto."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty good in addition to having a really nice atmosphere and looking really inviting from the outside. I passed it so many times meaning to try it. Pretty reasonably priced too. I think every main was $21.  I ordered the rainbow trout bouillabaisse. It was well done. My friend had the steak frites. Also quite good. Steak was nicely caramelized on the top and the fries reminded me of mcdonalds fries from the 80's (a good thing).  I'll be back. Good date place."}
{"text":"Lovely intimate little bistro conveniently located just around the corner from the AGO and behind all the big University Ave. hospitals. Stopped by for lunch with a friend this week. We were in and out in about an hour and lunch for 2 (no drinks) came to about $30 with tax and tip.  We both tried the tartines. I had the mediterranean tartine ($10) which comes with a thick layer of \"eggplant caviar\" (I was confused initially, but it's like purees eggplant), roasted red peppers, and crumbled feta. Bonus points for the option of getting half fries and half salad as your side. It's nice to be able to mix it up, especially if you're indecisive! Food was fresh, delicious, and nicely presented.  You can add a dessert and drink to make your lunch a combo/prix fixe for $17, but it didn't seem like that good a deal to me, and I was already quite full after the tartine.  Service was efficient and unobtrusive. The atmosphere is cozy and very French, and some of the staff are Francophone. Great lunch choice if you're in the area."}
{"text":"As part of the Summerlicious menu, I ordered the escargot, steak and  profiteroles for dinner.  Provencale Escargot (appetizer). The dish had a tomato based sauce, which was creamy and different from traditional sauces paired with escargot, which was nice. The sauce worked really well when used as a dip with the accompanied garlic bread.  Steak (main) - I ordered the steak medium and they cooked it perfectly. The steak was marinated very well and I could really taste the vermouth butter. However, the vegetables in the dish carrots could've been better, as the beans didn't have the fresh texture that I would expect.  Profiteroles (desert) - the profiteroles were absolutely amazing! The choux pastry was delicate, the vanilla ice cream was rich, and the portion size was good.   The customer service is also superb - I strongly recommend Midi Bistro and to try out their Summerlicious menu."}
{"text":"I've walked past this place many times without the urge to go in, but my roommate invited me to try the Winterlicious menu with her and I regret a little for not trying this place earlier. Maybe it's because I went with low expectation but whatever expectation I had, Midi has blown it out of the water.   Their food is delicious with large portion size. We started with the Cassolette d'Escargots and Salade Midi. The Escargots won out this round; it was perfectly seasoned and perfectly creamy. I wish they gave a few more slices of bread to soak up all that soup. The salad was good, and loaded with plenty of cheese, but not as exciting.   Second round we ordered the Seafood Pasta and the Lamb Shank. This one I would say was a tie, both thoroughly enjoyable. The pasta was loaded with seafood and the sauce is rich with flavor. The lamb shank is very tender, delicious with the sauce and mashed potato. I wasn't expecting to taste the cinnamon with the beets served with the lamb, not too bad but not how I'd prefer them.  Round three, desserts were nice little end notes to the meal. The creme bulee had the distinct cardamom flavor with crunchy layer of hard caramel. The profiteroles were smothered in sugary chocolate sauce. We were both completely stuffed at this point.  We reserved for 6pm on a Tuesday and the bistro was not too busy. All the food came out pretty quickly one after the other so we didn't really have time to digest before the next course was served. The chairs, tables, and decor could use a little revamping and a little bit more space between the tables would be appreciated. The serve staff were pretty friendly, no complaints there."}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing dinner we had tonight! Atmosphare is great, the food is awesome. Highly recommended (-:"}
{"text":"Went there for my first winterlicious dinner of 2014. We had a large group, and restaurant handled it very well, service was efficient and prompt, and a waitress was a wonderful young lady who alone handled such a big group with outmost efficiency and speed.  As an appetizer I ordered Caserole d'escargot which was in my opinion a highlight of the night. Mushrooms, escargot, and cream based sauce complemented each other well to create a perfectly balanced dish. Totally a must try! As the main course I ordered a grilled angus striploin steak, prepared medium rare close to the rare side and served with perfectly grilled vegetables. The steak was a little chewy but it must have been just a piece like that because it was perfectly prepared. Sun dried tomato and butter topping gave a steak a wonderful touch.  As a desert I orderes Creme Brulee which was tasty, but surprisingly cold, which was slightly disappointing.  Overall,  a very good experience,  and the whole 3 course dinner for only $25 per person was a true bargain.  Would definitely come back again!  P.S. this place is more suitable for a small group of people or as a date venue. It's very small, cozy,  and romantic."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious again, wasn't too impressed by the experience. Service was fast, a lil TOO fast. Food came within 10mins of ordering and there was less than 2mins between courses. Servers asked to collect plates when there were still food. We got the bill before we were asked. There were empty tables so I didn't understand the rush.  Escagots were tasty as usual, 1 extra piece of bread for the sauce would have been nice. I got the moroccan beef stew. It was fragrant and smelled of wine and vegetables. The apricots and carrots were lovely but the beef was a little dry. The whole dish also didn't have any form of starch so it wasn't very filling. Creme brûlée was good with a hint of ginger. The sugar top layer was very thick..like 5mm so I didn't eat it. Not the same enjoyable feeling you get from a thin layer of indulgence."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure to enjoy their Winterlicious menu. The overall experience was pleasant.  I ordered a French Onion Soup, which is sub par, not the best I had and definitely not the worst. I ordered their New Zealand Lamb Shank Braised in a Sweet Vermouth Sauce. I wasn't totally sold on the sauce, but I did enjoy introducing my taste buds to it. It might be what I'm accustom to, but I feel the sweet taste in the sauce was a bit too dominant to my liking. I feel it wasn't too complimentary as the sauce melt in your mouth, your struck with too many uncertainty as it tried too hard. It's not bad and definitely a surprise, but would I order it again...probably not. Their dessert was okay.  Given what I have wrote, for the price, I think it was extremely fair and reasonable. Would I visit again? I think I would. I definitely would like to try a few more dishes on their regular menu."}
{"text":"Really good choice for Summerlicious dinner, and the menu is only $25.00. Escargots and Duck Confit are really tasty and served fast (really like the sauces, especially the blueberry sauce for the duck), Profiteroles are nice but not so freshly made."}
{"text":"Ok. It would be 2.5 if available.  Went for a business lunch during summerlicious.  Soup was starchy, tuna was underseasoned and served with sickly sweet mango salsa and the creme brulee had a less than desirable texture.   Caesar said Veni, Vidi, Vici.  I say Meni, Midi, Meh."}
{"text":"Amazing food and very good service!  Our party of 30 had a great private function here with champagne and an amazing four course meal! Everyone loved their dishes!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and the portion sizes are quite large.  You definitely get your moneys worth.  Service is very friendly and a very good location.  We bought a Travelzoo coupon and the deal was excellent.  This is a restaurant I would come back to."}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood and have been wanting to try this place for ages, but could never quite bring myself to shell out $15 for a burger when I know I can get an awesome one for $11 at House on Parliament... So I figured Summerlicious would be the perfect time to give it a whirl. So I decide on lunch. I'll go later in the lunch period so it's not so crowded, I think. I call them to find out when lunch ends; no-one answers, but the voicemail says lunch is served til 3pm. I rock up at 2.35 and the waitress tells me they just finished lunch service, \"she's been meaning to update that voicemail message for ages....\"  Sigh. Frustrating, but fine, fair enough, I'll come back tomorrow. So I did go back, today; the place was packed, clearly, but I had made arrangements to meet my boyfriend there, and we'd both been wanting to try it for ages, to see if it could be our go-to local resto. So I thought I would ask the waiter. But I didn't get a chance. He charged towards me with a water jug and the second I said \"Table for two?\" he said \"Fully booked.\" and kept walking towards me--like, as in, he was walking INTO ME. I found myself being actually forced to walk backwards towards the door to avoid a collision, since he was not going to stop. I tried to splutter \"How long would the wait be?\" but he didn't give me a chance: he just repeated \"Fully booked\" two more times and kept backing me towards the door. Everyone in the restaurant was watching him basically physically push me out of the restaurant. Naturally at this point I wasn't about to hang around. I have never experienced anything like this. I get that the guy was busy and whatever, but seriously? You're actually going to back me up against a wall? That's how much you don't want customers?  Anyhoo, no biggie because we went around the corner and discovered our new go-to local restaurant, Bodega (check out the review). Five bucks extra for the prix fixe, but the service was superb, the food was great--PLUS they have a patio, which Midi lacks. And no-one tried to hustle me out the door before I could get a word in!"}
{"text":"It exceeded my expectations today. We went today because it was around the corner from visiting my grandmother.  We ended up participating in the summerlicious menu.   I would definitely go again"}
{"text":"Our party of five attended for a dinner reservation.  The service was the worst we have ever experienced.  We received no service at all for the first 30 minutes and it went downhill after that. Most of what we wanted off the menu was not available and the meals we did order were just barely acceptable and cold for the most part. It was clear that the restaurant tries to manage with a skeleton crew leaving the patrons to have to deal with bad service, poor quality food and a long protracted experience. You really get a sense that Midi does not value their patrons which translates in a frustrating and unpleasant experience.  There are many very good restaurants in the area and I would highly recommend supporting those that understand the value of ensuring a quality experience for the price that is paid."}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars based on an Average of two reviews. Came here actually first time during summerlicious, but don't remember much other than it being really crowded!  Came here twice recently both with Buytopia groupbuy $39 for a 3 course meal for two.  Came here yday, on a Thrs night which was similar to a Friday! Only about 2-3 tables! Made reservation so got out window table again! This time ordered the Escargot & appetizer of the day which was calamari with tomato sauce, striploin & fish of the day which was a red snapper with strawberry sauce done in the oven.  The appetizer was awesome! I loved the escargot, unlike usual escargot served in those little ceramic pots with 6 holes, this was served in a small baking dish with buttery cream sauce and mushroom! So delicious, there must have been like 10-12 escargots in there.  The calamari was ok, wasn't sure if it was fresh calamari or those frozen rings from the store.  The main, I was disappointed the steak didn't come with fries only a bit of veggies and salad, it was not seasoned at all. The red snapper was different, fish with sweet sauce, this was a first. Good size portions! the fish wasn't over cooked at all. Both mains could have used a bit more seasoning, as the steak had no sauce other than a wad of butter, and the fish supposedly savory with the sweet sauce, tasted somewhat bland!  The dessert we got the walnut chocolate cake which was done fresh, and the profiteroles with ice cream dried out and stale!  The waitress was very attentive and made many recommendations in compared to the previous dining experience!  When the bill came, with her fantastic service of refilling bread, water and overall asking us how our meal was a total of 4 times, had automatically added a 15% gratuity on the bill! She was superb!  Came here a month ago on a Friday night & it wasn't even busy, abt 1/2 half. There was only 1 waiter as it was a small enough place. He barely made any recommendations, when asked! We had the Beef carpaccio & charcuterie plate,  Beef carpaccio was tiny, 3 thinly sliced, charcuterie was decent size with salad and pate, followed by sausage and Proscuitto. The main we had the duck confi & mussels  with fries! I have always wanted to try their mussels as they have a list of different sauces! However was disappointed by the size! It was tiny & definitely was not 2lbs mussels, more like 3/4 lbs, size of mussel was peewee! Followed by Creme Brûlée & Apple Tart tartin with cinnamon ice cream. Funny thing is the waiter never asked us how our meal was yet he proceeded to automatically add 17.5% tip to our bill!  2.5/5"}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious, cute small restaurant. Food however was just average, and the salad was fairly bland."}
{"text":"A small place that seats thirty or so people. Me and my friends arrived at 8'ish for Summerlicious and waited around 30 minutes for a table. A group of four had been waiting longer than us but we got seated first as we were a group of five and it was one of few tables in the restaurant that could accommodate a group of five. The waitress gave them a free bottle of wine to tie them over until they could be seated at the next available table. Service was excellent albeit slow at the start.  The food was great. I had the escargot, duck confit, and creme brulee. The star of the night was the escargot - the sauce that came with escargot tasted like a tomato spaghetti sauce and it was delicious, only wish that it was accompanied with bread."}
{"text":"Well, as you can guess by the pictures, that is a decent place, but nothing stellar to expect - and I am very demanding for everything that is French, so harsh in my rating (cautionary note on my rating here). Ambiance and staff are nice (much much nicer than the Select for example!!), place is clean and the size of a real tiny Parisian bistrot, it feels good there; hence, as many other reviewers, 3.5 for the place, but a (quite) harsh 2.5 for the food."}
{"text":"Very pricey, and intimate little place. I was slightly offended the first and last time I'll be in here. After we sat I was looking in the direction of the bar observing the liq. Line up... The waitress walked up and asked me, \"are you looking for taps? We don't have taps\"... Referring to beer taps. Maybe I looked as if I was only interested in cheap pints. I had their mushroom risotto and it sucked. The French can cook but not Italian food... And ironicly the bottles of Stella Artois were old and skunky tasting as if they kept them in storage behind the fridge."}
{"text":"Dined at  Midi for Summerlicious with my friends. The food was great and customer service was outstanding.   We all ordered the mushroom salad to start(  I got mine without cheese). I was impressed by the customer  service because they accommodated my request without a fuss . We got the fish of the day main and the steak.    One of my friends had a question regarding  his steak dish .  he was wondering whether the Garlic Vermouth Sauce  came separately from the  Sun-Dried Tomato Butter . The manager came out and  explained   how the two were mixed together . I was very impressed at the managers politeness and willingness to explain how the dish was .  Midi is a decent place to dine and we will definitely be back  due to the excellent customer service.  My only concern   ( loss of one star on this review) was the presence of just one server for  the tables present. Please have at least three servers  or two at the minimum  scheduled to work  on the floor   during the busy periods. It was very saddening to see one server running around  when they would not have needed to had there been more servers ."}
{"text":"Food: good (seafood risotto) but not amazing for the price.   Atmosphere: very small restaurant, quiet, and so would not be great for larger groups. We were actually told to be quiet by neighboring group of individuals. Also everyone at this restaurant appeared to be 50+.  Service: friendly but slow. But I don't blame the server, they have only one server for the whole restaurant the entire night. This needs to change!   All in all, Baldwin st just around the corner has many more better restaurants that I wouldn't put Midi as my go to in the area."}
{"text":"This was my second stop on my Winterlicious food tour. I felt like trying a French cuisine and asked my friend to plan the event. We originally started off with 3 people but our party grew to 10+. The place isn't the biggest place as our party alone took up at least 70 percent of the restaurant. I found the decor to be welcoming and inviting. I didn't like where the door was situated. Every time it opened the entire table felt the draft. I think they should invest in either better insulation or more heaters for the winter time.  I was pleased with the options they provided us Winterlicious menu. I ordered the Salad Midi to start. It was a massive salad containing mixed greens, prosciutto, asiago cheese, walnuts and a pesto drizzle. I was satisfied with the flavours of this salad. It seemed like every component worked together. For my main dish I ordered the faux-filet grille. It was a grilled Angus striploin steak, sun-dried tomato & garlic butter. I would like to start by saying I was content with the amount I received but noticed some people at the table who also ordered the same meal got all different sizes. I didn't find the steak size to be consistent. I found the butter to be a nice added touch to the steak. I ordered mine medium well and was please with the way it was cooked. For desert I decided on the poire bell helene which was the poached pears with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. This was my first time I ever had poached pears and found it extremely tasty.   I was pleased with the service we received that night. Not sure if this is a great place for groups more for small inmate date nights I would think. Then again they don't have much privacy between table to table.   I don't know if I would return on my own, if I was invited to I would but I would go and make it my attempt to plan a dinner here."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious. Everything was delicious and the service was great. Atmosphere was super cute too. ^_^ Definately coming back !"}
{"text":"The first time was better than the last.  The menus are not too experimental.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they don't change that much.  In July I had this amazing beef stew that had fruit in it.  OMG it was the best thing I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Food quality is 2stars...I found the hollandaise sauce to be overwhelming... Poached eggs are slightly overcooked that there are almost no liquid in the eggs...Fries are just like what i can cook from frozen packages at home. I do like the cozy decorations, thus giving it 3 stars."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????18????3?????soup???????????soft drink ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Small place, great place for a causal sit down dinner. Had the lamb shank, good, a bit too hard to chew in some areas. In comparison, I feel like the seafood pasta on the other table looks a lot more attractive!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable! I was looking for an affordable French restaurant in Toronto and stumbled on this gem. It's cute and cozy. With French jazz strumming in the background the atmosphere felt authentic.   I loved that our server was knowledgeable of the items on the menu and actually spoke French. Our food was amazing and I would definitely return."}
