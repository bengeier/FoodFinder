{"text":"Great out door patio area with a large tv screen. Trivia on Wednesday nights is fun. Unfortunately I ordered the nachos per my servers recommendation. They looked tasty , but after one bite I could tell the cheese they used was the cheese you get with ballpark nachos. I was extremely disappointed. Would recommend going here to drink, but I do not recommend the food."}
{"text":"This place is really awesome! It's my new favorite place! The wings are amazing, you have to try them! There is ping pong and cornhole to play. Such a great environment with lots of room to move around. Can't wait to go there today!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. Open space with several different bars, games, TV's and so on. Beware of the bartender Barry S. He is a total jerk. He was unnecessarily rude to both me and the girlfriend, and it ruined our evening honestly. The other bartenders seemed fine. A place worth going back to, but I would never approach a bar with Barry S. as the bartender. I just don't know what his problem was."}
{"text":"Great spot heading into the summer season. The patio is great and dog friendly and is still nice and cool. It was fun playing ping pong while we were waiting for our food. Very excited to have another patio bar in old town."}
{"text":"The managers tried to grossly over represent our bill. So much so that we will never be returning to this shiesty representation of a bar. I hope the tab was worth it"}
{"text":"Should not be averaging 3.5 stars.  If you want fist pumping steroid fest, go down the road.  Great place to chill in Old Town without over paying for great food and drinks.  My only suggestion is they should bring back the saganaki and beer brats that were so popular."}
{"text":"Such friendly service and great food. My grandmother came down to visit and we decided to check it out for a nice lunch and couldn't have been happier with our decision. We got to sit were we wanted and we had a very nice and helpful waitress. She would check up on us and refilled our drinks without us having to ask also giving us a to go cup. For a bar focused grill the food was very good!! I'm not sure how it is at night but for a nice lunch before a day of shopping and walking its a relaxing and enjoyable choice! Defiantly will go back another time at night to check it out!"}
{"text":"Sat there 10 minutes without a single greeting, I will be right back, let me get you some water. Nothing. I was excited for the food but are you kidding me? There was no one to greet you when you walked in, so I asked a waitress if we could sit inside. She said anywhere you like with no smile or anything. We ended up going outside. 

Welp, their loss, we were going to meet up with a large party but decided to go elsewhere in old town. Thank you for weeding out the poor service so quickly, I would have been disappointed to give you my money with a start like that."}
{"text":"This place has a little but of everything for everyone. Whether you're 5 or 75, there's something for everyone. They have one of the longest happy hours in old town  (3-8 M-F) and have a great staff who enjoy their customers. I recommend to anyone looking for a family run local neighborhood bar and restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! Chelsea, Kelly, Matt, Luke... if I knew all of the staff's names I would list them all because they simply rock. Legit Bears bar, incredible happy hour and the food is truly sensational. Bears. Beers. Babes. Bags. Banging Burgers. Bad Ass.

Go. There. Now."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon and it was wonderful. The service was great and he made sure to have heaters out for us while we were playing games outside. The food was great and my whole party enjoyed what they ordered. I had the Mac and cheese and it was so yummy! There are so many fun games to play and a cool place to hang out! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"*NOTE* This review is coming coming far too late, and I apologize to the restaurant for taking so long to post this!

My husband and I had been driving for days and had finally reached our Old Town destination. We wanted someplace casual that had good food and drinks, someplace we could come down from our \"road buzz\" without a bunch of formality.  We could not have picked a better place to go. Boondocks was perfect! 

We sat at the bar and had excellent service with Kaitlyn, who was friendly, prompt and mixed a mean cocktail, exactly what you wish every bartender/server was like . For dinner, we chose several appetizers. The huge standout was the Duck Fat Fries. They were truly amazing, hot, crisp and light with perfect seasoning and dipping sauces. For those who don't like duck (I don't prefer it either), don't worry, they don't taste \"ducky\" at all! 

I strongly recommend this place. They have lots of great outdoor seating areas and games too. Boondocks offered a great dining experience for my husband and I but it sure would have been fun to have a bunch of friends there with us for an epic night of drinks and games!"}
{"text":"Boondocks has replaced what was once Spanish Fly, and has made fantastic use of what was once wasted pool space. I love the patio; games and performance space on the perimeter and plenty of seating. This place also comes with some of your favorite familiar industry faces which adds to the vibe. Alas, let's dig into the food shall we? 

The starters have a versatile range, but the Mac and cheese catches my eye. First, I've never understood Mac and cheese on an appetizer menu. A side? Absolutely. An entree? Sure. An appetizer? I guess I won't argue but it seems kind of off. Anyhow, I get the Mac and cheese that touts 4 cheeses, herb bread crumbs, green chiles and bacon. Yowza that's a lot. I'm expecting a powerful flavor combo, but it falls flat on my palette. I'm in need of a good strong central cheese flavor and less of the frilly add ons. I fear it may be a roux, which can really be tough for Mac and cheese because it can swallow up the flavor of the cheeses. 

Moving on I try the St. Pattys burger. I asked for it medium and it came to me well, however it is still fantastic! The Irish cheddar, with the mustard was just the right amount of zing juxtaposed with the fresh lettuce and tomato. Despite being well done, neither flavor nor moisture was lost on the combination of meats in this burger. So so good. Equally delish was the potato salad side dish. Fingerling potatoes in a heavenly creamy sauce with red peppers. I absolutely love red peppers in this potato salad to add that extra kick. 

I'm looking forward to coming back to Boondocks to enjoy their patio. While I'm at it I plan to try some of their tacos, and get into some of the red pepper hummus."}
{"text":"Been here before late night and loved it! Great food and awesome staff! Came for happy hour and was extremely disappointed. The food was under cooked and the bar staff was rude and inattentive. I strongly recommend rehiring the day staff."}
{"text":"This place has great potential.   But when the bartenders ignore you and it's impossible to get a drink on a Sunday night, that is defiantly a turn off.    If you want to order a drink here, make sure you look like the cast of jersey shore.  Also, they have three bar stations, but only one open with only two (terrible) bartenders working it??? We went the night before Labor Day, so it should have been staffed much more.    If they simply had decent bar tenders and enough of them for the size of the establishment, it would be great.    Pool, corn hole, and darts.  What's not to love? Work on your service!!!! Until then, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Great concept.  Have gone to Boondocks for over 10 times now.   Love that you can go inside when you want (summer) and outside for 9 1/2 months out of the year.  Also its a place that gives you option for activities.  Pool, Ping Ping, Sack Toss etc.... And provides the room to do it.   

Food is a little pricing for a lunch menu but worth it.  Beers on tap are interesting.  Mixing it up.  Really cool.  Service has been great.  No complaints at all.  Dog friendly is cool.  They take care of the patrons with dogs with ice and water.  Nice touch. 

 I read some of the other reviews.  Some of them either sound like they are auditioning for Secret Shoppers/Diners or they work for competing venues in Old Town.  

Thanks Boondocks (for being so new but a refreshing change to what else is out there)."}
{"text":"Totally the worst bar in Scottsdale. The owners have no respect for women and the bouncers are meat head thugs. From a foodie perspective, every drink tastes watered down. You have duck fat fries but no blue cheese stuffed olives. I rather spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Was able to get the tacos today (carnitas) love this place!!! I definitely recommend coming here on country bar night!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! The bartenders are very accommodating and make the drinks how YOU want it. The management genuinely cares about our visit(s) and makes sure we're taken care of. Me and my husband left El Hefe due to seriotusly bad service, not too far from Boondocks and truly got the service at Boondocks that we love. The food was awesome and our drinks were made for our pleasure. It's a great environment to hang out and meet new people!"}
{"text":"Didn't expect much for service here.  Sat at a table for 20 minutes and no one even came to our table.  After I stood on the table yelling does anyone work here, \"Sarah\" came over with a snotty attitude saying she was real busy.  90% of the table were empty what a joke!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst service I have ever received in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. We waited over an HOUR for 3 sandwiches while the bar was fairly empty. Our server had no idea what was going on and told us it was her 2nd day but they just put her out by herself so in addition to the hour wait for food we waited 40 minutes for our checks and check out. They didn't take off a discount card we had and then the manager came back proudly saying he discounted our champagne for us- looked at the bill and his \"discount\" was the price of the days special!! What a joke. Please save yourself from having an awful day/night and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Food, staff and TVs are top notch. Its a backyard party, the likes you've never seen't!"}
{"text":"If you are interested in slowing down on drinking and saving on a Uber ride drink here. If you aren't a servers friend you will get to enjoy chewing on ice as a second drink just isn't even a possibility.  I just don't get It. Such a great place but a staff that must get paid $20 an hour and doesn't work on tips. 3 times I begged them to give them my money, but for some reason they aren't in the market of giving people the opportunity to order more drinks.
Thank you for keeping the streets safe."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was to see the Rhonda Rousi fight. There is plenty of space to sit down in front of a TV. I ordered the wings which were good but I highly recommend the duck fat fries. It can get kind of pricey but it's well worth it.  I also like the location"}
{"text":"Soooo disappointed in this place. Used to bring all my out of town friends here to escape the Entertainment District chaos, but definitely not anymore! Trust me, this place has taken a turn for the worse. My girlfriends and I were there last Sunday and (1) Service was a complete joke (2) Food came out cold (duck fries) and was definitely overpriced (3) Good luck trying to hear anything over their godawful \"house\" music. Seriously no idea when this started, but now they legit blast dance(?) music that can be heard up to a 10-mile radius, which then attracts all the Entertainment District trash. Real winners at Boondock's these days! This bar used to have so much potential, it USED to be unique! Now it's just the same as the others. Such a letdown - will not be coming back."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in old town! Love all the staff they make you feel welcomed and safe no matter a weekday or the weekend. Matty with the blonde hair and tan skin is the best bartender in Scottsdale hands down! Much love for the boonies"}
{"text":"While patio bars and Scottsdale aren't really my favorite thing, this one is ok.  I prefer this concept to Spanish Fly, mostly because I'm not worried about me shoved into the pool if somebody stumbles into me.

Pros: 
Lots of things to do.  Large bar, plenty of TVs, bags (or corn hole if you're from the Midwest), couches and tables.  
The appetizers I tried were very good... the Whiskey Wings had a great, unique flavor-though I missed the ranch dressing.  The fried brussels sprouts were quite good, but almost too flavorful for a stand-alone dish... they might do better alongside an entree or salad.
Service was good, considering the crowd.  They were prepared for the busy night ahead of them.
It doesn't seem too difficult to get a seat ahead of a popular televised sporting event.

Cons: 
The setup of our table wasn't great for watching our chosen sporting event, on only one TV at the time.  We couldn't all sit on one side of the table so it was awkward.
The fan (that I acknowledge is necessary this time of year) was too high and too loud.  Men don't appreciate how annoying it is to have hair incessently blown into your face to tickle your nose no matter what you do.  I wasn't willing to sit in front of it for the hours we would be there, so the seating options were further restricted.
The TVs combined with music and talking were too loud.  Even for a bar.  It was too much.
The bills were delivered without the itemized copy. When the server offers to split the check, it should be automatic to itemize.  We weren't sure who got charged for which split items, and couldn't double check for accuracy."}
{"text":"My charity group hosted an event here a couple of weeks ago and they were really great; everyone had a good time.  I came back last Sunday because I remembered that they allow dogs on the patio and I had my pup with me.  I met a friend for a quick bite and a glass of wine and we had the best afternoon.  Not only was every single employee extremely friendly, they brought out cute little dog treats that looked like cookies and a bucket of ice water for my dog.  Our bartender even found an iPhone charger and plugged in my phone, which had died.  The food is much better than your typical bar fare and they have very reasonably priced wine on tap.  Overall, it was a great experience; I will be back more often!"}
{"text":"Best place in Old Town for playing games on an outdoor patio. Staff is fun and there is plenty of room for bringing a big group. That said I've come to watch a game by myself and ended up making several friends at the bar. It has that local hangout kind of vibe that makes it my go to spot for a casual beer.The crowd is pretty mixed and friendly. Wednesday night is county night and a lot of fun. There is live music occasionally with pretty talented musicians. Somehow ended up here on a Saturday night and the ENTIRE bar was singing Michael Jackson songs for some sort of retro night while dancing. Two other times a random pub crawl rolled through in costumes. Seems to always be something fun going on here. Oh, the Pork Belly BLT is AWESOME. Staff is great and seem to know everyone too."}
{"text":"Boondocks is my \"go to\" bar in old town Scottsdale. The alcohol is cheaper than the other bars in the area and the food is very good as well. 

It has a great atmosphere (both indoors and outdoors) where you can play cornhole, ping pong, pool, various arcade games, and jenga. It's the perfect place to watch sports or just hang out. I was just there for the Super Bowl and it was packed. 

You have to stop here if you're looking for a cool bar that isn't your typical old town nightclub. Ask for Joe the bartender, he will take care of you and makes great drinks."}
{"text":"Great live music, Corn hole, mimosa buckets and amazing drinks! Definitely a great place when you want a low key day/night away from the chaos of \"old town\"."}
{"text":"Nice bar! We came here for beers but there are games and good looking food. We would definitely come here again. Good music too!!"}
{"text":"Owner Tim was so nice, the food was incredible! Will be back to try out other menu items."}
{"text":"I've had several fun nights here, whether it be for a concert, out for lunch or a night out with friends. They have a nice selection of fun games to play, good service and decent drinks. Fun spot and always packed on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Four of us decrepit 45 year olds, went to Boondocks last night for the UFC fight.  Lots of TV's located throughout the place. The Inside is small, but they have a Great outdoor area with huge flat screen and several separate bar areas. .... After the fight, great dance music started..  We ate dinner and had drinks over a four hour period. 
The nachos were good, and Even though they used liquid cheese, the nachos were not drowning in a heavy vat of fake cheese, like most places serve them, and they were topped off with delicious,  fresh, house made guacamole. 
 The fried Brussels sprouts were awesome!  Pretzel was large and served hot. Burger was awesome, sweet potato fries were great.... All of our food came out fresh, hot, and rather quickly.  The guys ordered  several buckets of beer each.... ****YUCK ALERT!!!!****They serve Pepsi products.... YUCK! *****.   But I infiltrated my own Diet Coke, and the waitress gave me a glass of ice. I'm the DD, so it's important I have my Diet Coke!  
We got there around 7pm for the fight, stayed until around 11pm, before we walked around old town, visiting other clubs.   We left our credit card here, so ended up going back around 1am to pick it up, luckily, I had one diet Coke on reserve, so the guys ordered one more bucket of beer and us four old people sat there and people watched for another 45 minutes, thanking the LORD we were not young and broke anymore. 
The music was great and the atmosphere was fun... 
Nice mix of people, and a pretty even guy to girl ratio.... Nice looking crowd for the most part.  My husband said he doesn't recommend flip flops, You'll leave with sticky toes... And you won't be able to get into many of the other clubs in flip flops either....I"}
{"text":"I love Yelp and I use it everyday. Plus you have the hottest chicks working thereAnd the really smart to."}
{"text":"Don't bother wasting your time at this place!!! I wish i could give it negative stars because my experience was ABSOLUTELY horrendous. I called 3 weeks prior to my visit, spoke to a guy on the phone who was very friendly and assured my friends Bachelorette party of 16 girls would have to pay no cover, no wait in line and have my name on the list. I reserved this for St Patty's Day because i knew it would be crazy everywhere. 
When we got to the door these two door guys who had what we call \"chihuahua syndrome\" immediately spoke disrespectful and down to me. I told them my name was on the list for 16 girls, they're response without even making eye contact \"there's no list\" I told them about my phone call and one of the guys told me to meet him around back with $100 cash. \"I don't have any cash\" then he told me \"ATM's Work 24/7\" seriously dude? As I'm having this conversation a guy on his own walks out of the bar and this door guy takes the patron by the back of his shoulders and shoves him into the sidewalk screaming \"i hope you get hit by a bus\" honestly, had it not been a holiday and crazy everywhere else i would've walked away many minutes before. Thankfully another Bachelorette party showed up having the same problem and I had to talk my way into letting 28 cute girls into this bar full of douche bags, assuring them we were about to spend a lot of money inside and we shouldn't have to pay cover. This negotiation took insanely too long and after many disrespectful comments, they finally let us in. 
Finally we're in and i need a drink, stat! First bar we walkup to we hear the bartender telling a guy to (excuse my language) \"let's go San Fran, stop being a gay pussy and order a drink already\" cause he had a SF hat on. Along with that, the bathrooms were THE WORST I've ever experienced, anywhere. Puke all over that never got cleaned up, and girls just basically using the stalls to do drugs. So disappointed and will never. Ever. Return nor recommend this place to ANYONE."}
{"text":"Fun! Loved this place for my bachelorette party. They randomly have games and ping pong table, etc. Super fun outdoor area!"}
{"text":"I didn't really care for this place.  Too small to have a band as the noise levels don't allow socialization.  The bar tenders always have a sour puss face and really slow.  
We only ordered chips and trio dips so I am not sure how the rest of the food taste.  I will say our waitress was very nice and attentive. 

The environment was prepies in their 30's & 40's reliving their frat/sorority days."}
{"text":"Great dive bar for a night out. Pool tables and darts add to the fun. Also, food is a step up from typical bar food. I recommend the Mac and cheese (five different types of cheese, bacon, etc) or Cajun fried chicken tenders."}
{"text":"Love Boondocks! Staff is friendly, cheese curds are bomb, PBR tall boys always in stock. Great low key bar."}
{"text":"Boondocks is a fun, popular country bar in Old Town Scottsdale. You can go during the day and order food, but it's more lively at night. The drinks are good, but nothing out of the ordinary. 
The outdoor space is very open and inviting. There are large games (corn hole, jenga) and a water feature. 
It's a great bar for groups and you don't have to love country music to go. 
It's a little off the path of what is considered Old Town Scottsdale, but it's worth the walk. If you're looking for something a little more laid back or somewhere fun to go during the week- this is your place!"}
{"text":"Most everything about Boondocks is just OK.  
But there's one thing about this place that makes it 4 stars, and that's how FUN it is.

Ping Pong Table, Pool Table, 2 Corn Hole Setups, Jenga, Skee Ball...there's no other place in Old Town with that kind of fun atmosphere.

I honestly wouldn't recommend this place for Dinner, or really any other meal.  The food we had was just OK, as was the Service.  

Just come in for Happy Hour and play some games.  You'll have a blast.

ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Lots of entertainment, bomb food, & cool atmosphere. Mac&chz- awesome, fried fish tacos -spicy, perfectly breaded & so good, boon style dog- super delicious, & the double stuffed Oreo- wicked good. Def. A place to check out!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great drinks! Cane here kinda late, after 10 on Friday. Live band and great food. Can't see why to go anywhere else. I had the buffalo chicken pita, my husband got the tacos, and we shared the chicken nachos. This place is great!"}
{"text":"Go to Boondocks if you want the absolute worst service you can possibly experience in a bar. We ordered nachos and pepperoni bites, the nachos took over an hour and came out stone cold, the bites took another half hour and were black and burned to a crisp. We literally had to lean over the bar and stare into the bartenders faces to get their attention. I've been here a few times and the service has always been lousy. The staff just wanders around staring off into space or chatting with each other - it's hard to get a drink even when the place is mostly empty. I've given it several chances because the atmosphere, patio, etc. are all really great, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I usually stay at Aloft nearby and this place is walking distance. There's always a fun looking crowd no matter what day of the week. There's a nice patio area and on Tuesdays there's a taco truck parked there. The food is good from what I've had, definitely more pub food but I enjoyed their caprese salad!"}
{"text":"Very fun.... has it all.  Literally!  Great prices... band... every bar game there is... and I gotta honestly say I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Free Ping Pong and Pool.  Little more pricy than other bars but not bad for scottsdale."}
{"text":"Been sitting at the bar for 15 mins. No bartender has asked me for a drink.  They asked the Guys next to me who just walked in. Piss poor service and there were three men walking around which are no servers at all  only one bartender. I came in around 5:45 and left after being completely ignored. The people next to me had the same problem but when they asked one of the guys who isn't a bartender he gave them a drink then walked right by me."}
{"text":"I can only speak from a one time experience, but will go back there and hopefully update the review.

Was there for a company christmas party/get together; the patio was our location.  The atmosphere and decor is nice, fun and inviting.  The staff was polite, a manager that night was helpful with a silly price issue: the bathroom had signs of advertizing $5 shots of honey whiskey on thursdays; it was thursday and the company party didn't cover shots so we had to pay outta pocket. Ok.  I ask for one and the bartender somewhat rudely tells me \"no, that price is good only until 10pm\".  This is at 9:45pm!  So I told him the time & he replied \"well, you are part of the party so you can not get the promotion\"!!!!!!!! Wtf?  I asked for the manager, because it was silly, if I have to PAY FOR IT, who cares who I am with? Who makes this decisions? The manager wasn't all that happy to see me, looked at me and helped the situation as if I was drunk and crazy... Anyways, end of story, manager TIM gave me the shots for the $5 advertized price after mumbling some bs excuse.  

Hence losing a star here.  They could've handled something so simple in a polite manner and acknowledged their mistake.  I think he said the sign was old.  Well, the shots should've been free!  But overall, the place was nice.  They have games and comfortable sofa lounging areas....  Music was decent, drinks were ok, food was not great.  Hence the second negative star!  The staff wasn't frequent with replacement of the small buffet (mac & cheese, burger which was a sad thin patty, french fries, salad, pulled beef or something, couldnt tell cause it was never there, always empty).  

Two simple things, easy fixes I supposed; but the grill lost cool points with me..... Let's see what happens next time; if any. :)"}
{"text":"Our server Michael was amazing!  It was our first time there and got there right when it opened.  We brought our dog Teagan with us since they have a pet friendly patio.  Patio was huge and had lots of fun games if you so desired.  We each ordered the Bacon Bleu Burger.  I had a Orange Blossom beer and my boyfriend had the Double D IPA.  The burgers were delicious, they brought out ice water in a tin bucket for our pooch right away and Michael was very attentive and knowledgeable about their beer selections.  We will definitely recommend this place and visit again!"}
{"text":"Really can't beat the outdoor patio as the weather cools down at night. The big screen TV on the patio is always playing a major sporting event and happy hour runs until 8pm. They have about eight $5 appetizers and most beers are under 5 bucks whether it is happy hour or not. We tried the trio app with chips. The guacamole was the best of the three followed closely by the homemade salsa. It's a good outdoor bar atmosphere and they do have a newish menu also for about a year now."}
{"text":"I'm going to preface this by saying that I hardly ever leave reviews.  Tonight, I walked over to Boondocks with my buddy to catch the late NFL game.  As soon as I walked in the door, the \"manager\" immediately says \"you're not getting in here.\"  I did a double-take and said huh, why?  He proceeds to state that I look drunk, that my eyes looked red.  (I'm a type 1 diabetic that hasn't had a drink in 4.5 years)

 I tell him that I'm not and that I had just finished a cigar with my friend.  He says \"your not getting in here.\"  Again, I tell him that I'm a type 1 diabetic and I show him my Continuous Glucose monitor attached to my stomach and my Insulin.  Around this time, my buddy says hey this is discrimination.  

The \"manager\" says to my buddy \"wait, before you get all huffy and puffy and ask for the manager....I am the manager!\"  This goes back and forth for a minute until he says he'll let me in.  But then he says \"if I see a beer in your hand, your gone.\"   I didn't get his name, but he worked tonight, Sunday night 11/6/2017.  Once we got in the rest of the staff were awesome...just this guy who was apparently on a power-trip."}
{"text":"Spectacular Patio
Packed up the wife and the dog in the convertible and took a little spin from Gainey Ranch over to the Boondocks for Taco Tuesday. Huge shaded dog friendly patio with seating for a million. The Taco Trailer parked in front. Ordered 4 different types of tacos including an octopus taco. All spectacular. 2 margaritas, hold the salt please, and chips with guacamole. We did a little people watching and I noticed many young uns looking at us wondering who the geezers were, with no tattoos or pierced body parts, but they have a cool lookin dog! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been pretty excited to finally come in! If you have been to Spanish fly and Drift  you will see they kept a lot of the same things and made it their own too.
Which doesn't bother me, just makes me think of memories from the past! My first date with my boyfriend was at Drift! But if you are newly 21 you will not know the similarities! 

I really enjoy the openness of the patio- but I am afraid to come here summer time! It will be a hot one! I sat where the sun directly hit my eyes, which they need to get a shade for the bartenders & guests. 

The staff was pretty nice. And the security was even pleasant ! So that was nice to see smiles & noticed everyone was helping each other.

It was \"carb Sunday\" so we enjoyed their fries & macaroni. Both awesome, fries would of been heaven if they were cooked for a little bit longer.

The place does have some extra  Scottsdale annoyance with the people that go there- but you will find that anywhere in Oldtown!

They have a bunch if different games to play with groups which I noticed everyone loved.


I will be back, and I hope a lot!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago and Michael the bartender and bobby took care of me! Best customer service ever! Cutest bartenders!!!"}
{"text":"I use to come here regularly and enjoyed going here but Saturday night I was treated terrible. One of the \"bouncers\" was using racial slurs towards my boyfriend. And the server charged my credit card two times. I will not be returning here after being treated so terribly."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and ambiance! Cool during the day or night. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.  Plenty to do and really good food, staff and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Wish it still had the pool!  That way I would forget about the food that was served here and just keep having fun.  In its defense, if your looking for something just outside of the old town madness but still willing to pay a premium for drinks and so so food, this is the spot!  You are sure to get a seat here every time no matter the night or occasion.  Just be sure you remember the location if you plan on coming back in a year as this place will most likely be named something new.  Most places in old town try to revamp themselves into new and exciting places yet this one fell short again as did its neighbor.  In the 2 years I have been going out in old town Scottsdale these 2 locations will have been 5 different names between the 2 of them!"}
{"text":"This place was fun! Atmosphere was fun for all ages. The drinks were good and reasonable priced. The food was good bar food as well. They had a good happy hour. Music wasn't so loud that you couldn't hear people, which is good.it was still upbeat and fun. Great place to go and hang out."}
{"text":"I think boondocks  has a great concept it just fails on execution.  Since it is still relatively new I'm not going to be overly critical, because overall it was a good experience. 

Service: 4 stars - the server was very sweet and attentive. There were a lot of people working on a Thursday night but she still managed to make sure that we had everything we needed. 

Food: 3 stars- the menu was very intriguing it had a lot of unique options for a bar. Unfortunately when they came out while they looked pretty they lacked in flavor. It was like they just missed the mark on everything. 

Atmosphere: I think it's great that they covered up the pool from Spanish fly and opened up the area so it could be a more fun environment, with ping-pong and other games.  The problem is they really didn't update anything else. The bathrooms are still old and dingy and weren't very well-kept. 

Overall, I would compare this to a Gilligans... Kind of divey but a good place to go when you want to have a casual drink and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I thought this was a Cardinals bar.  Aside from the big screen, the TVs are featuring every other game. I'm here with a big group and we've asked multiple times for TVs within our eyeshot to be switched to the Cardinals game and they keep saying \"Someone else is watching the game so we can't change it to the Cardinals.\" Unless we go and sit under the glaring sun because they don't have enough umbrellas, I won't be able to watch the game. I won't be coming back here for Cardinals games in the future. So disappointing."}
{"text":"The Beer... The Food... The Games!! You really can't go wrong here and if you think you did, you probably walked in that way. Boondocks recycles their canned beers and donates the money to charity and drinking their drafts feel almost as good. Duck Fat Fries, Whiskey Wings, Ceviche, Mac & Cheese... Eat, Drink, and be Merry B*tches!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Kat did a great job. One of my favorite spots in old town. A completely different vibe from everywhere else. Plus... buckets of beer for $15"}
{"text":"Don't come here.  No place to sit.  Charged $25.00 and told we had seats.

We get here and placed orders. . And then after we received our order we were told we would have to stand the entire evening. 

Piss poor management. . Totally unacceptable. .

Won't be back. ."}
{"text":"They have poker on Thursdays!  Very cool.  The food was decent but just about everything is deep fried.  The cheese curds were solid.  The grilled cheese with bacon was a little too much.  Not bad neighborhood hang out and not as crowded as some of the other spots around here."}
{"text":"Boondocks is my new favorite hangout.  We were told about this place from a friend.  This place is such a fun, chill place. They had a huge patio which was nice to enjoy it before it gets over 100.  We enjoyed playing corn hole and ping pong. We would have liked to play jenga but there was only one set. 
The service was eh, ok. It could have been better.  Our server went at her own pace. Took 35 minutes to get a sprite.  She brought everyone else's drink but mine. I asked (reminded) her for my sprite 2x and eventually got it.  We waited about 10 minutes for our check after asking for it. 
They do have a food menu that I will try out next time. 
Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Great live music venue. Good food, good drinks. Stephanie is an awesome server. Kudos!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It is kid friendly during the day, and great for happy hour or late night drinks/eats with your friends.  

The menu, while not huge, is really well planned out. 

The staff is great, there are fun games to play, and good music is on all the time.

HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"Bartenders are rude, added drinks to our tab that weren't ours. This place isn't worth the time."}
{"text":"This place sucks I waited 25 minutes for a drink because all of the 3 bartenders clearly couldn't handle having 17 people at the bar. And somehow couldn't see that I was the only person without a drink. Thanks to the baldish bartender who finally asked after I decided I wouldn't buy anything here anymore for what I wanted to drink and jokingly denied me water for a few seconds. As for the bearded bartender and the older one with the spade tattoo thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"Boondocks is the most amazing place in Scottsdale. I had my engagement party there this past weekend and it was the best time I've had in a long time in Scottsdale. Scottsdale tends to be snobby and over the top, but Boondocks was the exact opposite. Scottsdale has needed a place like Boondocks for years and finally it has arrived. Everyone was friendly, atmosphere was open with plenty of room to spread out and enjoy your own space, food was fantastic with a wide variety and the best part was the live band and games. We played bags, beer pong, table tennis and dances the night away. We are from Chicago and all bars are like this out there so it was nice to see something in Scottsdale that has the same vibe as our home sweet home Chicago!  Thank you Boondocks for a night of wonderful memories!"}
{"text":"Great place! Had my friends birthday party here and the staff did a great job putting everything together and the owner stopped by to see how things were going. Food is good unlike most bars in the area and their drinks are priced good. 

Thanks to the Boondocks staff for making it a great evening!"}
{"text":"Boondocks is a super fun place to grab a drink or two on the weekend! I love their large outdoor space - there's plenty of tables and games to play. They also have a wide variety of specials and drinks, and a killer happy hour. 

The service is good and the bartenders make strong drinks, which is always nice because a lot of the time I feel like drinks get watered down. 

The food is decent! Granted, I've only had a few items (like their Mac n cheese or the fried Brussels spouts), but I've enjoyed it both times and it's better than typical bar food.

My favorite part about this is their dog-friendly patio, so be sure to bring your pups when you come!"}
{"text":"If you're coming here on a Saturday night, I would recommend getting there very very early as the line is massive! Didn't end up going in Saturday night because of how long the line was but it looked like a lot of fun. We decided to come back for dinner and to watch the end of the warriors/rockets game which was had pretty cool setting. There was a ton of open patio, tables, and TVs. Pool tables and shuffle board as well. Had a ragae band playing live music pretty much the entire time we were there. 

FOOD ORDERED:
DOCK RIBS/ SWEET POTATO FRIES: half off on Sundays which was an additional plus to them being fall off the bone good! BBQ sauce had a bit of a sweetness to it which was different but really enjoyed. The sweet potato fries with ranch and BBQ sauce was really good as well. Didn't imagine the ribs to be as good as they were. I would definitely recommend them if you're a ribs fan! Cole slaw was mediocre at best. 

SERVICE: Wasn't bad! The bouncer was nice and the hostess and servers were really cool and on top of the service. I thought everything was decently priced especially for the wings being half off."}
{"text":"Great country band on Wednesdays and lots of TVs for sports on the weekend. The pretzel is good and so are the duck fat fries. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place is great. Especially if you have a decent size group. I would highly recommend anyone looking for a good bar scene"}
{"text":"Everyone seems to be talking about this place! and on a dog walk we decided to drop in.

Well the ladies loved my DG and she sure did enjoy all of the attention on a very dog friendly patio.

Dad got his beer and DG crossed a few paws!

If the entertainment district has a dive bar this is it!!! I mean that in a very positive way. Prices are fair and service staff is cool and congenial, and that's refreshing for these parts."}
{"text":"Love this place! Stuff is awesome! Always full so if you are looking gor a place to spand great time with your friend it is perfect! Better than any club in OldTown"}
{"text":"Casual sports bar with large connected patio. It's a nice place to get away from the fancier Scottsdale bars. Lots of places to sit or stand, both inside and out.

It's easy to see the remnant layout from Spanish Fly, the previous bar that featured a large pool in the middle. I like what they did with the space - added more tables, an area for cornhole bean bag toss, and ping pong. The bar is large and wraps around with plenty of TV's. I've been here a couple times. The first was to watch a boxing match. It doesn't take long to have a drink in your hand and the standing room comfortably affords crowds. 

The second time was on a Saturday morning. A couple guys wanted to have a few rounds of beers and play bags. It was warm out, so despite the outdoor fans and portable AC units, we built up a sweat. We ordered a bucket of Coors light. You get 5 cans for $16. Later we ordered some Corona's. Again, we got cans. I'm not complaining, but glass bottles would have been a nicer touch. 

Sometime, I will try the food. My friends' tacos looked pretty good, and they've got a nice selection, though you can't mix and match. Overall, Boondocks is an average watering hole, with nothing particularly memorable about it. But that's not a bad thing! What it offers is a relaxed patio to grab a beer and watch some sports, preferably on a nice day. And sometimes, that's exactly what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Awesome and awesome.  The beers are in cans... They crush and donate the proceeds to local charities.  With being from Phoenix, more restaurant and bars need to follow suit."}
{"text":"Boondocks is a Modern Sports Bar that has a really Big Patio with High Top Tables, Ping Pong tables, TVs and other Games. Many but not all the drinks on the cocktail menu feature fresh squeezed Grapefruit Juice. 

They offer lots of interesting appetizers and shareable plates and they also have a Children's Menu. The menu had a wide assortment of sandwiches and all kinds of interesting burgers. 

Many things sounded interesting and I went with the Bibi Burger. I was sold on the Harissa and Raisin Marmalade and ordered it being not sure about ground turkey. But it was delicious! The Turkey was cooked like it should be but was flavorful and juicy and I really liked that spicy and sweet taste with the Turkey. 

My husband had the Sin Burger and it was really delicious too. It had Jalapeño Marmalade, Pickled Cabbage, Cheddar Cheese and a blistered Jalapeño on a four grind beef patty. For his side he picked the potato salad and it was good too.

The Burgers are very solid here.

I'm not sure if they offer any full dinners here as it seems to be just a very casual menu.

Service was very good.

They are open 7 days a week for 11-2am

I'd return."}
{"text":"I love this bar! I live at The Stetson which is less than 50 yards from it, so I'm here quite often! Food is definitely good - I order it all the time. The only major downfall for me is that they don't have many TVs to watch games on unfortunately. It's a great place to go with a huge group of friends nonetheless. They have tons of games to play, too... pool, table tennis, corn hole, darts, pop-a-shot, ski ball, etc! DEFINITELY come here for a bite to eat and some fun as well. #Boonies"}
{"text":"I love this bar in Old Town.  The outdoor space is fantastic and spacious.  The multiple bars cut down on wait times to get a drink.  With a great number of TV's, you can almost always find the game you want to watch.  Friday night is definitely the night to go if you want a large, diverse crowd.  Saturday night is fun for just relaxing with friends to get drinks."}
{"text":"Nice set up, generally cool staff, decent selection of drinks...haven't gone beyond the pretzles though food wise.  The prices are old town Snottsdale style but the people are what make it into Scottsdale classy but chill.   If they were like my usual haunt price wise, I might be  more regular."}
{"text":"This easily could be the best patio in Scottsdale, and the food is really good, too.  There are some booths inside if you want to get out of the sun. 

On a Saturday afternoon before the party got started I saw some dogs taking in the sun on the patio, too. It's a good place to hang out for awhile. Misters make the patio bearable in the summer.

I recommend either the burgers (there's short rib in the grind so there's a lot of flavor, and the one with bilstered jalapenos has a burn that's not over the top) or the chicken sandwich with goat cheese. The sweet potato fries tasted fresh."}
{"text":"Good music and a big indoor and outdoor patio area...

Decent band was playing when we were here night before last. The guy actually had a pretty good voice...

Ping pong tables and bean bag games are available....

Friendly staff and a bunch of couches and some pool tables give you plenty of things to do while you hang out with your friends....

Not a bad spot"}
{"text":"So we had a group of 8 meet here for MNF/welcome back to AZ HH for a friend. I got there 10mins early & sat at the bar. Not once did I get greeted or asked if I wanted a beverage. Then my friends show up & we seat our selves in the couch section w/ a tv. We wait 20mins for a waitress (KeriAnn) to greet us & take only our drink orders. Then another 30mins goes by still with NO DRINKS yet. Finally a partial drink order makes it to our table and then the other half of our drink order makes it 15mins later. We watch the game & order food. The waitress messed up my order of shrimp & grits with shrimp ceviche, REALLY?? I also ordered the CAB sandwich (that was good) My shrimp and grits came out way after the fact that everyone was finished. 
Ok-skip to the pay our tabs part....she then proceeded to charge me for the shrimp ceviche (that was more expensive then what I ordered) When I asked her about it she said \"My managers busy so I couldn't cancel it out, but it's actually cheaper for you\" WRONG. She finally did get the items fixed but also totally messed up on 2 other friends tabs (added drinks) and GET THIS..... Totally forgot an ENTIRE food order for someone & when asked about it she FORGOT AGAIN!!! He was served NO FOOD  the entire time we were there (3hrs) 
They have a nice \"game bar\" concept with bags and all (that we wanted to play & drink more) but decided to relocate to The Lodge (just down the street) due to the HORRENDOUS service. I'm SAD The Lodge will be closing soon. I wish it was this place! Never will I be back here, there are way to many other great bars in the Old Town area with way better food & great service (Kelly's, LoCo Patron, RnR, Bungalow, Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers, The Lodge, Bottle Blonde) Visit them 1st so you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"It's an AWESOME place! I love the pizza bites and all the beer they have there. They now are showing every Alabama game for the rest of the season, so I plan on being there ALOT!!!!! All the staff is friendly as well! ROLL TIDE!"}
{"text":"so this is the third time i've been here, but each time it's been a different bar! there is no longer a pool (thank goodness), but instead a giant dog friendly open air patio! love that. we only had a few beers here on a pub crawl, but it seemed like a friendly place...lots of good looking people. 

we'll be back with our pooch next time."}
{"text":"Our office is literally a block away, and every once in a while we like to have a long, relaxing \"business\" Friday lunch including a beer or three. I called ahead, b/c I brought Clyde, my Weimaraner to work today, and wanted to make sure Boondocks is dog-friendly. Jennifer, the bartender, answered and said, \"Absolutely!'

A two-minute walk later, Clyde had a big glass of ice cubes to munch (by request), and then a few minutes later, a big bucket of water  (unsolicited). Jen also brought him 2 dog treats as well. Nice touch! :-)

I'd like to make this all about Clyde, but my chopped salad was fantastic! The dressing was obviously homemade and well seasoned; there was chopped egg blending into the spinach and lettuce mix, portabella mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, and more. I added grilled chicken to the salad, and it was perfect! I couldn't finish the serving, and not for trying. I wouldn't pay $15 for a lunch entree every day (hard NOT to do in Sdl) - but this time, it was worth every dime. 

My co-worker had the pork belly sandwich with a huge portion of fries, and he also loved it. He remarked that it was nice to have a menu with a quality and variety of selections worthy of Scottsdale prices. 

Clyde perhaps, was not the \"perfect\" guest, as he barked to be given ice cubes. I was worried about his behavior, but no one seemed to mind...

Will be back! Thanks, Boondocks!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fun place to come at night to hang out and grab drinks with some friends! I didn't drink but my friends said their drinks were strong and reasonably priced. 

If you're looking for a good hangout with games and a pretty chill atmosphere this is your place!"}
{"text":"This bars good, maybe great. It perfectly fits a gap in the Old Town scene that was left when The Lodge shut down. It's outdoors, the food is good, they have games if that's your thing, and they draw a good crowd.

But they have this terrible bouncer. He's a tall guy, probably 300 pounds, he's not really muscular, has a buzzed head of hair, darker complexion. 

Friday night 3/23 I had a bad experience. I was just waiting in line to get in, but when I showed him my ID with my old picture from 2002, he said I should \"cut my hair like in my ID picture, it looks stupid now\". I appreciate a good joke, but this wasn't a joke. He was just taking a dig at me.

Then... once I meet up with my buddies on the inside, my other friend (who has a shaved head and is slightly balding) tells me that the same bouncer gave him a hard time too... for no reason mind you. just said: \"Looks like you're balding\"

I'm not going back there.
I'm going to suggest to my friends that they not go back there.
I'm going to suggest that strangers not go there either.

Just because of one bad attitude.

Yelp isn't just a place for people to complain, look at my reviews, there are plenty of positive ones. But I think it's a great place for businesses to look at what's working and what's not. This guy is definitely not."}
{"text":"Best service I have ever had! Abi is the best! I have been here many times and Abi is the absolute best"}
{"text":"Managers were rude to our group. Overpriced drinks and food, misleading pricing, Bill was predictively wrong and overcharged. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This bar is quickly becoming one of my favorite spots in Scottsdale. They have plenty of seating and multiple screens for the game. They have one huge projector screen in the middle of the patio. Did I say patio? They have a large outdoor patio with plenty of seating for everyone. Come, relax, have a drink, and enjoys your friends."}
{"text":"So much fun. Tons of activities on the patio. Lots of Tvs and one huge one for games. The staff is really polite and attentive and the service has always been consistent. Hands down my favorite bar in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Fun place a little expensive 6 $ draft beer's but lots of fun stuff and a good atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place is fun! Corn hole, Kenya and other games are available to play with. The food was excellent had a burger and it was made perfect. Drink specials are cheap and well worth it! Great place day or night"}
{"text":"I love the new concept of this place. Best place to relax and enjoy a real good time. I would recommend this play to everyone."}
{"text":"Look the fries are the bomb dot come. Margaritas for me feeling free. Great atmosphere great service and lightly battered fried pickles. Love it! Plus made new furry friends. The whole package!"}
{"text":"I love the layout of this place! There's so much room to hangout, lounge around or play video games and bags. They also have a ping pong table and ski ball. The night was a bit chilly but they had the fire pit going. It was great to sit by the fire and have a couple drinks. 

Majority of the crowd was the younger college crowd. I'd say between about 21-30's.  Not an issue at all, everyone was busy with their friends. 

The only hiccup we had was our first night grabbing a drink there we had a waitress who left without telling us. We waited and waited and wondered where she was so we could order another drink. Come to find out she had gone home and didn't close us out nor did she have another waiter take care of us. 

The second time in we had a wonderful waitress! 

I'd definitely hang out here if I lived in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I won't say for sure that this place is a racist establishment, but it sure seemed that way. I wish I could give it negative stars. My dad and brother were in town so we went here to grab some burgers and beers. The beer buckets came out relatively quick, but we waited for our food for OVER AN HOUR before deciding to leave for another burger joint. Yes, that's right, OVER AN HOUR and the food STILL hadn't come out. We ordered 4 burgers and I was starting to wonder if they had to go out and slaughter the cows or something, it was taking that long. The table to our right which showed up at least an hour after we ordered and the table behind us which showed up at least 30 minutes after we ordered both had their food brought out before ours and the only difference between those tables and us? Well, our party had 3 black people whereas the other tables were all white people. 

Like I said, I won't say for sure whether we were treated crappily because of race, but really, there should be no reason whatsoever for me to even get that impression. The waitress was ok (I think her name was Brooklyn), but she should have noticed that we had been waiting for our food for, again, OVER AN HOUR and she should have done something about it. I used to wait tables back in my college days and I never would have let customers just sit for over an hour. The manager (who I'm pretty sure was drunk) should have done more than just give us 50% off of the two beer buckets we ordered. They should have been 100% off considering the HORRIBLE service and experience we had.

My alma mater sometimes has alumni events here, but I will be contacting the president of the alumni association to ensure that future watch parties and alumni events are NEVER held at this place. I have never had such a horrible experience or been treated so terribly in my life. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Love this places outdoor atmosphere. We came here for a college basketball game and they accommodated our team. So we begin and ordering food, first appetizer was delicious. Brussels sprouts that are heaven to our sinful mouth then we order chicken nachos and wait..... And wait...... And wait.... And wait...... When we asked Stephanie (our server) she thought we ate them already, that's how long we waited! She actually acted like someone else had them, until we asked another server and the order was never put in in.... So the plot thickens.... They arrived cold and extremely underwhelming. Not sure if I come back but it's worth at least some Brussels sprouts"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Love the huge patio which had live music.  A great place for large parties!"}
{"text":"My Friday night spot. Great live music a drink snacks! Mini corn dogs! Kat is an unbelievable waitress she always gets me twisted"}
{"text":"I've been here twice every time the female bartender overlooked me for male patrons and had attitude we are ok on this place better funner places in old town to go to with way better service"}
{"text":"Decent bar in old town. They have a really awesome outdoor patio and usually have pretty good bands playing. Great prices on booze. The reason for the 3 stars are the incredibly disrespectful staff. Doormen have a Napoleon complex and are very confrontational. They will snap on you for breathing wrong. Just because you have a hat that says security on it does not give you the right to berate paying customers. This place should take a good hard look at how their employees represent their business. What I saw and experienced was disgusting. I really enjoy coming to this place but as long as a few select members of the current staff continue to work there I may be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Simply a great bar and a refreshing change from most of the stuff down in old town. Actually has good food and we'll made drinks with a nice relaxed patio with lots of fun activities."}
{"text":"Had The Blue Cheese Burger with egg and very good. Wie had the hot dog with coleslaw on it. She almost did not get the dog because of the slaw, but after tasting it she said was the best hot dog she ever had because of the slaw. Sat at the bar and it was a good experience all around."}
{"text":"This is THE place to play corn hole and ping pong while watching the game with friends. Later in the day, it turns, strangely, into a meeting spot for Scottsdale more mature crowd. Lots to do, lots to drink. Great hang out place. Only issue I have had, twice, is game watchers acting like idiots, yelling, fighting, etc. People who are very TEAM PROUD seem to have trouble with their mouths and tempers in open areas...

They have a jalapeno burger that will burn your face off, I think it was called the sin burger. The ribs and wings are good, best was mac and cheese...

Beer is in cans, prices are good. Service is usually great. Bring your jersey, and some brawn..."}
{"text":"The security guard named Jeff that works the front door is the most rude person I've ever had to deal with. He thinks because he is a security guard that he can bully people. Put someone with an ego in a position of power and that is what you get. He should be removed from the establishment immediately."}
{"text":"Have been to this place two times now and I probably will not go back. Drinks are expensive and seem to be lacking- you don't get the alcohol you pay for!
Went in tonight to try their food and catch up with a friend. Did not get any service for the first 10-15 min.  The server was nice, but seemed one fry short of a happy meal.
We both ordered the holy cow- which came out cold and both plates looked different. The meat was cut different than my friends and she had more slices. Not only that, the meat was ice cold! 
I could go on- but don't want to. I won't eat there again!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday with friends, waited forever to get our order taken at our table so we got up and ordered from the bar. They ran out of fireball throughout the day, and the bathroom had lights that were out making it extremely difficult to see, and there was no hand soap. After we told an employee about the bathroom, they informed the manager who didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"Visited this bar/restaurant based on a review in the AZ Republic.  The Republic had a better experience than we did, although we had a nice experience.  Had picnic table and Tiki Hut décor.  Cute.

Drinks were excellent, as was the service.  Our appetizers, however, were served cold.  The bar seemed understaffed.  

Nonetheless, we'll try this place again."}
{"text":"Such a great bar! Tons of games to play, great draft selection and even the food is awesome. Matt behind the bar is literally the heart and soul of this place and is always spreading smiles, even when he's slammed. Great spot for out of towners!"}
{"text":"We were here 730 on a Saturday night nobody even came over to ask us for drinks we were sitting at a table for 10 minutes worst service ever won't be back!  Wasn't even busy!!!"}
{"text":"Christmas decor & light blowout!!

Beautiful outdoor led lighted patio with fun yuletide lighted characters. Love the long fire pit. Easy parking, big toilet, in and outdoor seating and chill patrons. Enjoyable this night. Rock and country playing."}
{"text":"Brussel Sprouts w/goat cheese, Blue Cheese Burger, Hummus, Shrimp Ceviche, Pork Belly Sandwich W/Bacon, Macaroni and Cheese, Duckfat fries, are just a few of the delicious items I had on my last visit to Boondocks. This place is great. Service was great,  ambiance is great, music is great, drinks are great,  what else can I say. I will be visiting this place again very soon to try the multitude of selections on their menu!  Everyone should check this place out.  Daily specials are awesome!  Happy Hour is legit! Weekend entertainment is free and exciting!! Don't forget there canned beer to help out a local charity!!!"}
{"text":"I unapologetically love Boondocks. It's refreshingly unlike anything else in that area of old-town. The crowd is down to earth, the food is simple, and the decor is relaxed. Last Sunday my friends and I spent hours there to cool down after \"Sunday Funday\" at RnR. Such a good choice. The live band was amazing and we were able to pass the time by playing a variety of games, like bags. Great bonding. On Thursday nights, they have \"free\" poker. You're able to play for sport and without the risk of losing all your money! 

Love Boondocks. Go there!"}
{"text":"Was here during bachelor party golf weekend. Came on a Saturday eve/night. Bar staff were not very attentive and took forever to get drinks even when we had their attention. Finally getting a seat and it was filthy and not wiped down, then people in standing room areas were so close to our table it was like having someone's @ss right in your face. There's an uncovered area (outside) where smoking is allowed but due to the downdraft all the smoke comes inside and the place stinks. 

The servers in and around the tables were also not very friendly at all. Drink orders were wrong a few times, or forgotten completely. I was charged for a few drinks we never ordered and one of my friends' tabs took 45 min to close out...just a poor experience and a loud annoying one at that. Next time in town I won't waste my time here."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were really fresh and tasty  nice large screen tv great place to chill with a cold beers"}
{"text":"This is by far the coolest and most original bar in town. The management especially Matt Olms make this my bar of choice and the only establishment I will frequent in old town. The food has a broad menu from gourmet salads to burgers! I think I've tried everything on the menu and haven't had a bad meal yet! Ask for Matt and tell him brandon sent you!"}
{"text":"Don't go....they take your credit card....put it in with a hundred more cards...when your ready to go they say their receipt machine isnt working....then charge you a huge bill. I went with my girlfriend...came home and they had charged me a 240 dollar bar tab. What a rip off. So sad because it's was a fun place."}
{"text":"My first time coming into this place and was pleasantly surprised! 

There was only one bartender (Tim) and it was pretty busy, nonetheless he was on it for just about everything. Drinks, food and atmosphere was great, only problem was the misers made it cold once the sun went down but that's not a big problem. I love the patio and now open it is. 

I ordered the bbq bacon burger and I was completely satisfied with the burger itself and the crispy perfect fries it came with.

I will certainly return, especially if I'm day drinking! 

5/5"}
{"text":"First I would like to say the entertainment was great. Good live band. But everything else fell short of good. Service was extremely slow, about ten minutes for two drinks that were literally just liquor with a splash of mixer. If you asked for anything expect to ask two or three times before you received it. The food, the food was just straight bad. Succulent chicken was far from succulent. Burnt small piece of chicken, maybe 3oz at most, and I mean burnt. Almost no whipped goat cheese and a piece of canned red pepper. There were five onion rings, far from a side. And neither were seasoned, the chicken screamed for salt. The chicken wings were bland and needed seasoning too, although the buffalo wasn't too too bad. Barbecue was definitely no go. Tacos were basic and they forgot the cotija cheese and without it they needed salt too. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, to be honest and doubt I'll be back, not in an area that offers much better food and service."}
{"text":"Typical Scottsdale douche bag central. 

Bartenders are douches and slouches. Extremely slow and inattentive. The wait for a beer, even on slow days is painful. 

Crowd is of course 'look at me' lame. Beers are poured short and are expensive.

Patio is ok but will get WAY too hot in summer unless they shade it somehow.

Very limited tap beers. All other beers are in a can, which is supposedly for a charity thing but realistically probably getting dumped out back.

Yes there is Cornhole/bags but the bags are so poorly made they leak their pellets all over the patio. 

Hard to see this place making it in it's current form.

Unlike what Yelp reviewer Pepper said, this is NOT a \"sports bar\" let alone a \"modern\" one."}
{"text":"First off, I'm not one to complain much. But this time I had too. After waiting for a bartender for a few minutes I placed an order for the Sin Burger, I asked for it to be cooked medium well aka NO pink. The burger came out in decent time, but after cutting into it I saw that it was more like a pan seared tuna steak, Unbelievably pink in the middle. I was so hungry and had a guest in from town so I didn't complain, I ate around it. Told the bartender about it and she shrugged her shoulders and said sorry. I know it's not her fault but she could have done something instead of handing me the bill still asking me to pay full price. Boondocks is a great place to hang out and drink but the food service needs attention. I'll still go to the bar but I won't be eating anything other than French fries because you can't fck those up!"}
{"text":"pretty sweet place from what I remember.....whether it was the excess tequila or the place itself, I do remember having a great time. Lots to do (pop-a-shot, bags, darts, etc..) lots of space, good drinks, friendly staff. Will be back for another night to not remember."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Huge open seating, loads of comfy couches and viewing spots. Amazing cocktails, and you MUST try the whiskey maple peach wings, incredible! Service is fantastic."}
{"text":"Best outdoor patio!!! Food was okay but the service was so slow. This place is more for people trying to play bags, drink beers and watch a game."}
{"text":"Amazing food, so glad I came here on a Wednesday night once again.  Stopped by for the tacos and  have now found out they have an amazing country night on Wednesdays! Great place ,  keep up the good work guys.  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! The bartenders are ALWAYS extremely friendly and very awesome!! I would highly recommended this place! Awesome service !! For someone to \"NOT BE SERVED\" AND \"IGNORED\" ..they must have been biligerant and/or inappropriate."}
{"text":"Boondocks can be a great spot for live music .. but on an off night there's no reason why satellite isn't showing D'Backs or US Open ..."}
{"text":"Went here after seeing a movie @ Tempe Marketplace. Was recommended by a friend as a place for \"older\" (meaning late 30s & 40s) to go to dance. Was looking for more of a club, and all I found was a glorified bar with activities such as cornhole and ping pong. 

I've decided to give Boondocks the nickname  \"Secular YMCA for singles\".

Our table had a bunch of water on it when we arrived. Didn't look like it was cleaned off properly.

Glad to see there was a DJ, but no once was dancing. There really wasn't a dance floor anyways. Not sure the purpose of the DJ - why not just play music over the speaker system, save that expense , and put it into more marketing & promotion.

80% of the patrons were single. And those that were couples seemed to be there with other couple friends. Do not suggest going there if you are a couple out by yourself, wasn't too fun.

Wife's dirty martini was pretty tasty and reasonably priced for Old Town Scottsdale. I just had a water. 

It's a decent place, just wasn't for us."}
{"text":"Love this bar! They allow you to bring your dogs, and it has a very large patio with a huge TV screen in front. They have live music on the weekends, and it's normally the same band which is not the greatest in my opinion. They have great deals on mimosa buckets on Saturdays and Sundays. Really like this place! Only gave 4 stars because sometimes the waitresses are not very attentive. Overall, one of my favorite places to go and it has a nice laid back vibe."}
{"text":"The bartender charged an extra $10 in gratuity to my bill. Be sure to check your credit card statements."}
{"text":"Good place for a cocktail and some food after work.  Food is made with quality ingredients, something hard to find at a good place to drink as well. I recommend trying it out, PLT is delicious,  as well as the mac n cheese. Also the quinoa salad is a  perfect healthy snack. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Came here last night and it was a lot of fun.

Boondocks has a nice patio with cornhole, some pool and best of all it is Dog Friendly!
We came here for a happy hour and had some of the sleepy dog beer (so good!) and ordered some of the pretzals and I was happy with the service, food, and beer selection.
I also got some water for my puppy, and they gave me a nice dog treat for him (super cute!).

So - why 4 stars and not 5 if it was a great time? Bc I don't know what sets them apart. I need to try more thing sin their menu and really see the quality of their food. But the pretzals were bomb! And puppy enjoyed his treat!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Me and my girlfriend went their for the first time and, it will he the last. The place was not busy at all for a weekend night and thought it would be a good place to have a quick drink. After waiting at the bar for a few minutes (which is normal) the female bartender came up and asked us what we wanted. My friend asked a question about the ping pong tables they had, she abruptly answered her and then walked away without taking our order. The bartended then proceeded to service the men at the bar asking if they were ok and if they ended anything else.We tried to get her attention because we were ready to order but she never came back to us or even looked our way! We both stood there confused because we were ready to order and just because we asked a question before we order didn't give her the right to completely disregard us as customers. I don't know if it was because we were female and she didn't think she would get a good tip from us or if she just wanted the men's attention. Who knows! I will never go back to that bar and will not hesitate to let my friends know about the bad customer service either."}
{"text":"The staff in this place clearly don't know what customer service is they were all rude and full of bad attitude.
I probably would not go back there anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome to hang but be careful at the line. Daniel told me to put his name. Very offensive to women and used curse words. Fun area but Daniel told me to go fuck my self so I wrote this."}
{"text":"Had a great time at the birthday party I was at tonight. Called an Uber and while waiting I asked for a glass of water. Proceeded outside with the cup of water and the bouncer just aggressively took the water without any warning or, \"hey man you can't take that outside\". I would have kindly walked back inside and drunk the water, but no. It was a total f-u. Parched my whole way home, over a totally aggressive bouncer who could have just been normal for a moment and let me have some water. I could have cared less if I drank it inside or not. You just had to be a jerk, and hence your 1 star. For nothing and you deserve it."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Scottsdale Boondocks has been a popping place. The atmosphere is great for large groups with many personalities! They have darts, skee ball, and sometimes they even bust out the N64 for Mario kart!! The wait at the bars can be long and they seem to let certain people skip the line which can be annoying during busy nights. 
Last time I was there a girl slipped and fell and a bouncer came running up and proceeded to yell at the woman and kick her out without ever inquiring about wether or not the woman was injured. Her boyfriend then tried to calm the situation and was immediately cussed out by the bouncer. I can't say with certainty wether or not the girl had too much to drink but regardless after the fall she took I would assume the staff would ask if she is ok before proceeding to escort her out of the bar. Unfortunate experience to say the least. During all my other visits I've had enjoyable experiences, hope the next is as well."}
{"text":"I would never set foot in this place again. My wife and I stopped in on a Wednesday evening. The place was maybe 30% full. We seated ourselves, and waited 10 minutes before a waitress bothered to come by. The table top was filthy, and we asked if she could wipe it down and the waitress (Pink hair and lots of Tats) got a huge attitude. 10 minutes later she came back to take our dinner order, (we weren't drinking) and after taking our order demanded a credit card to open a tab. I reminded her we weren't drinking, and she said \"I know, but a lot of people dine and dash, and then I m responsible!\"  We eat out in Scottsdale several times a week for the past 25 years. I have never had anyone ask for a card to open a tab for dinner, again, we Were Not drinking. I was insulted by her attitude and demeanor. I walked up to her at the register, told her I was leaving, and wanted my card back. She then tried to give me someone else's credit card. What a joke. Keep on driving!!!"}
{"text":"BAD ASS!! Mike is so funny. Very kind and keeps you on your toes. Makes the experience great! Of course... extremely HANDSOME."}
{"text":"You can bring your dog here and the vibe is laid back, chill and fun. You can also play bag, pool and the music is pretty good. It's a great neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"I went to boondocks just the other day and had the wings and fries- they were absolutely amazing. I loved the vibe that the place gave you and the staff was beyond friendly and attentive. 

 definitely making this my new spot with friends :)"}
{"text":"Fun Hangout Spot 

Boondocks is a fun, unassuming bar that offers a nice break from the rowdier party scene. There are a number of bar games (pool, darts, skier ball, hoops etc.) to play with your friends, and the ambience is cool. I've had the hamburger, grilled chicken salad, and steak pita, which were all decent. The standard bar fare is probably your best bet. My friends and I frequent here a good amount, and we always have a good time!"}
{"text":"We stop in here every now and then and grab a bite to eat and a drink before we head over to Fox Cigar bar. The burgers here are great! they have a great spicy burger, of which my husband and I loved. The staff is always great, and friendly. Sam is a great guy and is always attentive to whatever we need. They have pool and darts inside, which are fun as well. We like this place quite a bit. Its situated outside of the main old town strip, so you're not getting all the drunken old town people all around you at all times."}
{"text":"The best \"regular\" bar in old Town. Such a chill place to go especially for anyone new to the area. Every time I've gone there is such a good energy and the bands they hire are really good."}
{"text":"I always have such an awesome time at Boondocks! This time around, a huge group of us came to get happy hour and sat at one of the couch areas. We constantly had people joining, and our server, Spencer, was always over to check on us and grab our joiner's orders. I am a server, and I know how hard it is to keep track of large parties if people are randomly joining, so I was very impressed. Thank you Spencer for being so on top of everything, we had such a great time!"}
{"text":"(Read in a shatter voice) Star date 12162016: a cool cloudy night with a windy breeze created the perfect atmospheric conditions for a great night. There was live music by a band from a foreign town and beers from mystic town. They had an excellent experience created for the patrons to enjoy. I find, what they call \"cornhole,\" to be one of the lost amusing games. They throw corn-filled bags onto a board and someone declares victory... astonishing. 

We have travelled many galaxies, but have never encountered such a place. If these fellow compatriots get  my message then you should make a stop to refuel on some liquid gold at boon. 

Update star date 957041.24 (Dec 19th)

Captains log, star date 2116.358 (xmas eve): after a long journey searching the last frontier, my crew was in much need of some relaxation. We found ourselves among Boondocks station located in the Milky Way Galaxy. This time we have found that it was a tranquil night; it must be due to the time of the year. We found ourselves playing some rousing games of pool while kicking back that Irish goodness they call Guinness. As we were about to embark on our journey, we were halted by an icy atmosphere that halted our ships from travel. Nevertheless, Boondocks indeed took care of us. This has become a great space station or, new home, for our rests."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! They have three different bars, The drinks are very good with fabulous bartenders. If you're looking for a good place to go on a hot day this should be your number one spot to check out."}
{"text":"I get it, we were 15 min. late to our reservation, we're not from here, we didn't gauge the uber situation right- it happens. But we get to the bar I tell them I made the reservation an hour beforehand, we were late. I let a super nice perfectly quaffed haired security guy know, he says let me see what I can do. A bald headed ass hat security guy comes to scold me about being late, \"I need you to understand you won't get a table, I can't guarantee anything. I don't look at reservations made within the last hour.\" I'm in the service industry, I definitely understand, there is just a better way you can go about it. We picked another spot instead hoping for a friendlier disposition when we checked in."}
{"text":"Sadly this bar is very typical of Scottsdale bars that charge high end prices for food but come up very short. Come in for Monday Football with a friend. Waitress came over within 3 minutes and suggested that it was Cheesy Monday, half off Mac n Cheese or Cheese Bites. Call me simple, who doesn't like a Mac N Cheese plate? Order a Orange Blossom, which tasted flat? I took a couple of more sips and yes indeed it was flat, waitress comes over after 10 minutes, and I tell her that the beer tastes flat, she tells me beer can't go flat? Having thrown a couple of keggers, I know otherwise. She tells me that she is going to ask them to change the keg (yeah right). I got another Orange Blossom and it still tastes flat. I deal with it. Waiting for the Mac N Cheese, I notice that the place isn't that bad of a place to hang out, it could be maybe be a decent alternative to The Lodge, this was before my next experience.  So the Mac N Cheese comes out, The first thing I noticed is that it comes in 2 small skillets, 1 bowl would make clean up a lot easier, but hey I like simple things. My friend and I notice that there is no real cheese sauce on the Mac N Cheese, so we take a bite to see if maybe it is at the bottom. Nope, there is a slim sauce on this so called \"Mac N Cheese\". We ask the waitress, if we ordered Mac N Cheese or some noodles? She tells us, \"we\"ll you don't want too much sauce it will ruin it\". Nope its already ruined. As the menu stated \"Mac N Cheese with cheese sauce, bacon and bread crumbs\" The bacon was fake and bacon that comes in a shaker, which I didn't think they made anymore. She brought out some more sauce, which made it ok. How can you ruin Mac n Cheese? Ask Boondocks because they butchered it. Upon getting our bill, I noticed that the waitress charged us $1.00 for the cheese sauce. Classy move Boondocks. I wont be coming back here, ever again. The menu prices don't justify the food they serve you, I can imagine how the $18 ribs are? No Thanks...."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday afternoon, and unfortunately for the restaurant, our group of 4 were the only people in the restaurant. The man working (possibly the owner or manager?) was so accommodating. It was cold out so he made sure we had heat right next to us while we played corn hole. We ordered our drinks and food and everything came out as ordered and was delicious. We each got something different and were all very happy. I hope that even though this place doesn't have 500 reviews, people will still give it a shot. Also, they have a Groupon that costs $14 for $24 worth of food!"}
{"text":"I love this Bar!! The service is always amazing. OMG the brussel sprouts are out of this world amazing, and I love the free bird salad ( its huge!! ). Matt the bartender is soooo attentive and helpful, he really completes the amazing customer service!! Its also really cool that they provide Free poker on Thursday nights with specials. Thats awesome!!"}
{"text":"So a small error was made in the event my debit card was accidentally given away to another patron, nightmare! However I was incredibly impressed how the situation was handled. Not only was my bar tab taken care of, Michael Kogan also gave me as well as my friends drinks as well as paying for an uber to go pick up my debit card from another bar and return it back to me before I left. In my opinion this is the epitome of customer service! So thankful the mistake was not only corrected but to feel like he really cared about returning my lost item. Fellow service industry worker approved."}
{"text":"I used to love this place until the bartender  tonight called me a bitch. I cracked a joke and he told me I was a bitch and we wouldn't serve me. He proceeded to pour himself drinks and chat it up with his buddies all night and no longer serve the bar after the moment we got there. I will no longer come back considering the amount of disrespect I received tonight."}
{"text":"We saw this newer place open a while back and gave it a shot.  It seemed like this place has too much space for what they are trying to do...it is really kind of random.  There are games thrown all around with little keep up.

The vibe is a mix between D&Bs and a scottsdale nightclub.  We hung out outside on the patio and were able to have a good time taking this place in while hanging out with our group. The beers aren't too bad, they have a nice selection and you get quite the glass.

If we stumbled in here again I wouldn't be mad, just indifferent, this place is meh."}
{"text":"I didn't know bars still allowed smoking in the main areas....what??

Tried to visit this Patio & Grill with my family including my sister who's currently pregnant and we had to leave immediately. 

Disappointed that it wasn't listed anywhere that there was smoking inside."}
{"text":"To be fair this is more of a 3.5 with serious potential. The atmosphere is great... Ping pong, corn hole, pool table, darts and music all make for a great time! The menu isn't bad either. I've had the chopped salad, grilled cheese bites, \"free bird\" chicken entree and the nachos. All great bar food! The problems: The wait time for food (I've been a few times now and waited 30+ minutes every time). The service in general is slow but this place is brand new and I don't see these issues being permanent. All in all it's a really fun place to hang out!"}
{"text":"Really nice to find a bar with people country dancing in old town. I went on a Wednesday night and it was surprisingly busy. They played country music 95% of the time, and they had entertaining dancing contests that kept me entertained. My friends all had a nice time."}
{"text":"This bar has the feel of a tailgate party. The majority of the bar activity occurs in is large, mostly uncovered patio. It has cornhole and other outdoor games and a huge outdoor projection screen for game watching. It gets particularly busy on Friday nights with mostly a 20/30s crowd. My only real compliant is that for a relaxed, outside of the main Old Town bar loop, they still charge a premium drink price."}
{"text":"I'm not much of an Old Town Scottsdale guy....at all...except when I have to watch a Basketball game at the depressing Majerle's becuase I don't have a TV at home.  Somehow I stumbled upon Boondocks which has formerly been many a bars.  

This place is such a surprise.  If you can get past what I call the \"Celebrity Service\" (Celebrity Service = when the servers think they are celebrities and care more about talking about themselves and what they look like than caring about the people they are serving), you have a winner.  

The atmosphere/games are bad ass.  It's very large and spread out.  Clean. And the food was pure shock and awe for me.  From the Moink Burger (maybe my favorite burger in town) to the Carnitas Tacos  to even the Broccoli appetizer....all winners!! 

Thank you for this place!!!"}
