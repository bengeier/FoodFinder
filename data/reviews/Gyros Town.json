{"text":"Great food!! We go here every chance we get. The gyro pita is excellent as well as the kafta kabob. Everything is made fresh and hot. If you like authentic Mediterranean food this place is for you!"}
{"text":"5 dollars for a side of chicken kebab.  That comes down to 1.25 for a 1 inch by 1 inch piece Of chicken ( photo is in the photo section).  I was really hoping to like this place since it's so close and I don't have to drive to 67th Ave. and Happy Valley for Ammos since I am right around the corner from this place.   Food was bland and when I asked why the chicken was so expensive, she said it's because it is marinated ."}
{"text":"It's really good stuff especially chicken, oh my God it's amazing lot of food you should try this place"}
{"text":"UPDATE 06/21/2013  UPGRADED TO FIVE STARS!  We went back and got pretty much the same thing as last time even though I really wanted to try something new.  The shawarma was even better this time (how is that possible?) and my wife and I agreed that this place deserved a full five star rating.  It was a Friday night and there was a steady stream of customers coming in.  Everyone looked happy eating here and I am hoping this place stays this good.  I wholeheartedly highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Not too bad...the service was friendly.  The bread was nice but my beef shawarma was overcooked and very dry."}
{"text":"*Love* this place; I want to put the Greek dressing on everything, it is so good. I did take out and didn't get the right food but didn't realize it till I left; came alllll the way back (not at all happy) and they made it right. They need help at the counter getting the orders entered properly; asked for fries with my combo plate and was charged extra for fries instead of getting them with my combo. Happens often; just check your receipt and order before you leave or just eat there! It's a very clean and friendly restaurant, with huge portions. Yes, it is pricey but it's a mom and pop place, with excellent food and huge portions so I'm happy to pay! I love the combo plate with steak shawarma and gyro meat. Comes with fries or rice and a Greek salad. I get an extra pita and share it with my daughter and we still have leftovers. Worth the price."}
{"text":"Great Gyros! I have always been a huge fan of greek food and gyros but sometimes it can be difficult to find a good place for greek food. I saw this listed online and really didn't think much of it but thought I would give it a try. It's a little restaurant in the middle of a shopping center. Maybe 15 booths and tables inside. They have a pretty big menu and lots of options. I got the gyro combo that came with a drink and fries and I took it to go. The tzatziki sauce is amazing and next time I will probably ask for extra since it was so good. Everything turned out perfect with my order and the person at the counter was so nice. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love that this place is close to home! I usually order a supreme plate (chicken kabob, kefta and gyro) with rice and additional Greek salad.  It is seriously enough food to feed our family of four! Great quick go-to place for dinner when I do not feel like cooking. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical when my wife suggested this place, because I really didn't like the last greek place we visited.  This place is very good, especially the traditional beef & lamb gyro.  The people are really nice and helpful, the service is good."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and the food is very good would highly recommend it if you like Greek food.....!"}
{"text":"Staff sucks.  The Ladies that work there are always sistting down.  Playing on their phone.  Food is great.  Like.  Today.   We waited almost 30 minutes for our food.  We were about to ask for our refund.  But.  Then someone's else did.  And got there food before we did cause they called the owner.  Serivce sucks!!!  The two blond chicks need need to be fired!!!!!   Never had such shirt service before.     (.  Get new employees)!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Clearly fresh and authentic food. People are friendly and the place is clean. I have the Gyro plate every time."}
{"text":"First time at this place.my wife and I ordered the Gyro plates.,one with fries ,the other with rice.The food was very good,the salad was nice and fresh,I later realized I did not get any onions with the gyro plates but we were done and it was not important anymore,( I love onions).The lady owner was very nice,polite and while here in Arizona,I will recommend highly this small,nice place to have a good meal. We are snowbirds from Wisconsin. The people of Wisconsin. May 8 2014"}
{"text":"It's a shame after going there for many years to leave a negative review. The food is pretty good, a bit greasy, but definitely not bad. It's the poor business etiquette that prompts this review. Online they advertise regular gyros for $5.85. I went in to order two of those (which I was going to make a meal for $2.50 more a piece), and a speciality gyro as well. But, instead of honoring the price posted online, the owner turned away a loyal customer's business over $1.30, and in this case he was wrong. \"Oh, I meant to change the price online, but haven't yet.\" (which is what he told me) isn't really a great business strategy, or excuse. If the owner's business acumen is this disparaged, then I really can't imagine where else he might cut corners in concerns to food quality and such. So, he lost a customer. The good news, there are plenty of other greasy ass gyros places around, just a little further drive. :)"}
{"text":"Gyros Town is our new, go-to place for chicken gyros with feta cheese!  We used to go to Roman's Gyros in Sun City, but they've since gone out of business! We usually get the chicken gyros value meal with fries and a drink. I get a baklava with pistachios as an added treat to this delicious meal.  The restaurant is noticeably clean, service is fast and friendly, and they have a wide variety of meals to choose from! Parking is terrible in this area. I recommend parking by the Dunkin' Donuts drive-thru, as it's so much easier to get in and out of this spot."}
{"text":"Really good food and really great prices and the place is always so clean and neat. Also I love the fact that the guys that make the food always wear gloves. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Excellent food at a great price, split the supreme plate with my wife, more than enough for two, baklava for dessert was excellent."}
{"text":"OMgosh as a transplant from Chicago i was hankering for gyros. Especially \"weirdo gyros\" (aka gyros with no pita). That's delivered. The owners were really sweet and the sauce. Holy moly the sauce. My new home town favorite"}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the food was fresh and delicious. We got the Philly cheese steak and a combo plate and everything was very tasty."}
{"text":"Great Gyros, chicken, and gotta love the pizza puff! A Chicago favorite. Staff is very nice as well. We didn't realize they closed at 8:30 tonight, walked up to the door at 8:25 and the nice lady at the register ran to the door to tell us to come in! That never happens! Always 1st class here and food is great!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food!  We have eaten here a half a dozen times and they do not disappoint.  Their Lentil soup is so tasty and good for a lighter dinner with a pita to dip in it!  Love their shawarma either chicken or steak, gyros, hummus!"}
{"text":"My wife and I go to Gyros Town at least once a week, we have been going for three years now and have never had a bad meal. I wish I could give this restaurant more than 5 Stars it's that good. All the food is fresh and very high quality for a \"Semi Fast Food Place\" I think they must grow there own vegetables, they taste so good. Can't say enough good about the food and the service."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food, and when this restaurant opened not far from my work a couple of years back I had to try it. Their food is very good. It's a bit pricy, but the amount of food you get for what you pay is more than fair. I've tried a bunch of different meals and I've found them all to be highly satisfying. Gyros Town is always near the top of the list when I am deciding on a place to go out to lunch."}
{"text":"Place is disgusting and service is the worst I have encounter.  After waiting for 20 minutes, ended up with wrong order.  Everything is dirty. A man comes in from smoking a cigarette outside, did not wash his hands to handle food properly. YUKE!"}
{"text":"This is your run of the mill Gyros place.  Nothing special here.  The food is fine and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Great tasting food! I especially recommend their gyros, chicken (GREAT flavor) and kafta(fantastic seasonings!). We are very happy this place is here to be a regular lunch or dinner stop"}
{"text":"Living close to Lake Pleasant Town Center, my family is always excited about restaurants that are new in the area. We have been at this restaurant a few times and each time have ha issues with orders. I have Celiacs Disease and am very careful about what I eat(have to). Most Greek restaurants are very accommodating and eager to understand the needs of the customer, unfortunately this is not the case here. When asked to keep all bread on the side, we were told it wouldn't matter if the bread was on top. Again we asked and the first visit the staff remade it reluctantly, but the second visit they did or would not do so. I would suggest that the owner 's and staff read up on allergies with food and learn about the needs of their customers. By the way of course I did not eat the meal. I enjoy Greek Food and the Greek people, a little sad that the true spirit isn't present in this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is like walking into my favorite kebab stand in Germany! They've got everything! Not fit big groups. Don't expect a break on pricing for large party orders though. He's definitely priced for the location, no doubt! There are some small tables a booths, seats less than 50 I think. Good Greek food, nothing fancy, just tasty!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought that you could find good Gyros in AZ? The gyros were cooked perfect and the tzatziki sauce was a feet nice flavor. Way to go Gyro Town!"}
{"text":"Used to eat at the one on 83rd and bell and the one three doors down from the current location.  Italian wedding soup is excellent.  So glad they have another surprise location."}
{"text":"I work near the lake pleasant towne center and just flowed my nose into this lovely little place. I've never been a huge Greek food enthusiast but this place has converted me it is delicious. I recommend it to every one. I'm still working my way through the menu but I have not been disappointed actually the complete opposite I'm always blown away. The location is very clean and the people are very friendly and nice. If your new to this food genre they are happy to answer questions an educate you on the menu items."}
{"text":"My top 3 favorites are the chicken souvlaki, veggie plate,  and the lentil soup, and they're always delicious."}
{"text":"Great place for Greek food. Food is fresh and tastes great! You can't go wrong here, but the Gyro special is a fantastic deal!"}
{"text":"I have planed on going to Gyros Town for a while but never had the time. So I finally made some time and went. I had a gyro sandwich meal. It was  filling and the gyro was one. I will be going back when I get the urge to eat Greek food."}
{"text":"Im recently a gyro lover, and this place has some good ones.  The 6.99 meal with fries and a drink is perfect.  The lady up front is very nice and takes time to ask you how everything was.  Fries arent the best youll ever have but they go well with a gyro, the meal was great.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very good middle eastern food!! We had the beef souvlaki and the beef shawarma wraps. The meat had great flavor and melted in our mouths. The staff and owner were very nice. We will definitely be going here more."}
{"text":"This place shouldn't even be real. Food sucks, customer service sucks. Can't stand this fake Greek spots. Can't find any good places I still recommend King Gyros but that's a little far from here. Try Greek wraps Also. I don't know how the owner even makes the food. Does he not care?"}
{"text":"We have take out from here. Best Greek food since I left Florida!! Home made dressing on the salad. Very authentic!"}
{"text":"Gyro shop located on the NW corner of Happy Valley and Lake Pleasant next to Chipotle.  I ordered the Fireman gyro.  It came with a lamb meat and beef meat along with some peppers and onions in a flat bread with tzatziki sauce.  I made it into a combo for another couple of dollars for fries and a drink.  Extra sauce is 55¢.    The gyro was tasty.  The meat had a good flavor and the peppers gave it a great kick of heat.  The bread could have been better and more toppings would have been acceptable for the price.  The fries were limp and soft.  Some of the weaker fries I can remember as of late.  Any fast food fries kill these easily.  On top of that they gave me maybe 12 fries total.  Looked like half an order on my plate.  My meal ended up being about 10 bucks with a tip and that is just far too much for the product.  It's pretty disappointing seems how there is almost no restaurants worth visiting in this area.  I was hoping this would be a go to spot.  But for the product, quantity, and value it just isn't worth another visit.  They either need to make better fries, give you more of them, and offer extra sauce or they need to lower the prices.  They simply will not survive if they don't make some adjustments.  Try Z's Greek and compare.  For less money you get a much better product and much more food.  Too bad it's so far away."}
{"text":"Don't go here expecting to get fries with your meal combo!! You pay extra for two fries. What a rip off!!"}
{"text":"Food was not good. You can't substitute any sides for another,and the service makes this place a complete fail."}
{"text":"Everything is so FRESH and tastes homemade. I got a million comments on it in the lunch room today at work. Had to fight people off with a stick to be able to eat my lunch :-)"}
{"text":"Had the \"value meal\" and yeah. Better than some Greek restaurants. (This is more cafe) and the best price I've paid in a while!  My belly's happy."}
{"text":"This place has my favourite Gyros thus far in my life. The regular is good but I go for the Chicken Gyro, no not the Shawarma, it's a Gryo! Thinly sliced chicken breast goodness!   The Pita is fresh, thick and pillowy. The Tzatziki is on point, the meat is tender and delicious, and the ratio of everything is perfect.   It's really depressing when it's over."}
{"text":"Oh man...their gyro salad is THE BEST! Great service, quick, the guys who work here are great."}
{"text":"I was a little surprised when my wife said she wanted to dine at Gyros Town. Not because she isn't a culinary adventurer necessarily, but because I didn't know she was interested in Greek food at all. Her reasoning was, \" We have been pretty lucky with trying new places and foods, let's try there.\" Alright then.  I am really glad I married my wife. She is smarter than me and it comes in handy like when trying new restaurants such as this one. It is a rather cozy little restaurant with booths on the sides and tables in the middle. We are a booth family and these were definitely booth family approved. There is a television, a drinks cooler, and a counter to order otherwise. Very simple, very effective.  My wife and I ordered a number one which is just a basic gyro with fries and a drink. I like to try the basic stuff at restaurants I am not familiar with so that I can get an idea of how they cook what should be their simple recipes. What we received was a very tasty gyro. The meat might have been a little salty but I really don't have a basis for comparison in this food genre. There was also a tasty sauce inside the pita bread that complimented the meat. If I knew the name of it I would say it, so for those of you who I just offended with my lack of gyro knowledge, I apologize. The side of fries was an afterthought but I don't want to short change them because they were pretty good. It was a good portion of food in the basket. It was just enough to top me off.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I received the impression that each customer was special to them. That each person in the restaurant was an opportunity. That sounds horribly cliche but I really mean it. The young lady who took the orders walked around and cleaned the tables as the patrons left and politely asked others if they were enjoying their meals. A little later another gentleman who I identified as one of the chefs came out to see how the food tasted. I responded with an honest,\"I am really enjoying it\". It feels like a start up even though it has been around a little while. I will be going back to support the fact I am thankful there are little shops like this that remind me that I need to try new things."}
{"text":"My boyfriend absolutely raves about this place and his food always smells and looks delicious, but I cannot speak for it. I called about GF options and they had no idea what gluten free even was. I'm totally okay with places not having those options for people with celiacs or allergies but at least try and know what types of food allergies are out there if you are working at a food establishment. She asked me if gluten free was a spice. Like I said, I've heard nothing but greatness from here but I wish I could experience the fun!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Saturday evening. Absolutely a recommended establishment. We had Gyro salads, the salads were very flavorful, fantastic fresh vegetables in the salad, and good sized portions. Staff was personable, and service was fast. Great hummus too! Very clean restaurant as well. We will be back."}
{"text":"This my first time trying this place and I was very disappointed. First I will say this is only in relation to the service and the salad - I have not tried anything else there. First I waited on the phone for over 5 minutes to place an order. When I picked up my large Greek salad, they said it only comes with one small dressing. I paid $1.50 for extra dressing and when I got home, they had only given me the ones I paid for and not even the free one that comes with the salad. I called back to talk to the manager and was put on hold again for another five minutes. The salad was decent. I am a vegetarian on a low-carb diet so there wasn't much in there by my choice but I was still not impressed with the presentation. The tomato and cucumber slices were large and I had to cut them when I got home before I could even eat the salad. Looked nothing like the picture on the menu. Quality and service are important to me so not sure I will be going back."}
{"text":"We live in both New York and Arizona and eat in Gyro Town often.  We've tried quite a few items on their menu.  Everything compares to some of the best Greek food in New York.  Extremely tasty and friendly.  Clean restaurant with cute ambiance."}
{"text":"This place is very good, not the best, but it has reasonable prices and good quality food. I had the lamb gyro, which was awesome on my first visit, but today I had the chicken kabob plate and while the rice was great, the chicken was just okay, mildly burnt. Definitely recommend trying this place and getting a side of Greek fries!"}
{"text":"So we decided to try this place for Taco Tuesday. It was busy as expected , waited in line about 20 minutes until we got to order. This was fine and then they put the orders together like chipotle or subway telling them what you want on down the line. Price was good and with their app we got another $5 off the total price.   The tacos however IMO we not all that good. The chicken and beef were very bland and not a lot of meat to boot. The pork one had some flavor but again very little meat.   Staff was nice but due to the taste or lack of taste of the food we won't be back."}
{"text":"Really good Greek food. A little pricy but matches the area. You get a lot for the money though. The plates can probably feed two adults."}
{"text":"Food was tasty. Loaded with gyro meat and fries were hot. They wouldn't take the yelp coupon which is one reason I visited. Said owner was no longer accepting them. So beware."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. I am a Gyro freak, so that is my major barometer for a gyro place, even those like this one which has a large menu.   Great Gyro sandwich, soft toasted pita, amazing tzatziki sauce, and red ripe tomatoes and crunchy onions."}
{"text":"If you like food that's been dropped on the floor and serve to you anyways then this is the place to go otherwise the food is really good."}
{"text":"Sad ... I had a Gyro platter.. Great service.. They gave a lot of everything. But with so much competition in the Greek faster food world the meat tasted like bland processed meat.    I would compare this to a chain in CA called daphne ..    If you like that taste than GREAT . This is the place for you..."}
{"text":"Great place to get a Gyro plate, and the salads are very tasty as well.  Happy that is joint is on my side of town!"}
{"text":"Very crappy service and cashier. Charged me extra and then when i asked her she said so you need 2 dollars back. I was like of course yeah. With prices so high they need definately provide some service than being rude and stupid."}
{"text":"My son asked for Greek food, I was pleased to find such a delightful spot close by.  The service was great, the gentleman serving made a recommendation that my son was very happy about and it saved me some money.  \"Win, win!\"    The food was delicious!  The baklava is off the chain.  We will come again."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times in the last several months. I start craving it! The food is always delicious and the service is always friendly.  We like the gyros, but I like the platters better, having a good variety of tasty items on the plate- and a salad too!"}
{"text":"My family and I get food from here all the time! They have good customer service and we really enjoy they're gyros! Will be enjoying there food many more times"}
{"text":"I will given them five stars for location and 2 stars for food. I didn't like the food. It's not up to the par of what I have experienced elsewhere."}
{"text":"Please check your takeout order before you leave. What a disappointment we ordered the chicken kabob plate with a side of soup and when I pickup I checked he had a salad in the house place of soup and beef kabob for chicken kabob. The rice was stale and dry what a Waste of time and money. The And the people are not that friendly too looks like a wrong choice will never be going back their again."}
{"text":"Excellent gyros, and salads . We have been taken out here a few times since moving here. The gyros are very flavorful and the salad portions are plentiful.  We just tried the Falel yesterday and OMG, the best falel ever. The Tazeki sauce is also good, I usually ask for extra. The only disappointment to me is spanokopita. (Spinach pie) too greasy ."}
{"text":"We were so looking forward to this place opening.   Ehhh, a bit of a disappointment.  Very clean, very friendly (counter) service.  But the food just...well let me explain.  I ordered a gyros.  Combo of beef and lamb and that's fine.  But the meat had way too much pepper in it.  60 minutes later I still tasted pepper.  The tzatziki was ok,,,something was missing - maybe a bit more cucumber?   My partner ordered chicken schwarma.  Her complaint was that the chicken was chopped up - heavily chopped up.  Hard to eat because the sandwich kept falling apart. She expected and would have preferred thinly sliced meat and more garlic in the garlic sauce.  We split a small greek salad.  Again, just ok.  The dressing was mostly oil and vinegar - not enough spices except oregano and probably no dijon in it at all.  Menu?  Basically a bunch of sandwiches in the $5-$7 range or add $2.50 and you get fries or rice or a small salad and a drink.  So would we go back?  Probably not.  If I start seeing better reviews, we might try once more.  Sure would like them to add a bit to the menu...like taramosalata, pastitsio, moussaka, or maybe souvlaki?  And for goodness sake, one of the fun parts of a greek restaurant is watching them shave the meat off the revolving spool.  Maybe Gyros Town doesn't do that, but if they do, they ought to bring the spool out from the backroom, so people can watch their sandwich being made."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!!! Best Greek food I've ever had. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Two words you must remember. Pistachio baklava. This dessert is done well here! There is also walnut, but only tried the pistachio one.  The combo appetizer plate was adorned with hummus, baba ghanouj (blended eggplant with spices, garlic, and olive oil), falafel, and dolmas (rice parsley, dill, and more all wrapped in grape leaves). I am already a fan of baba ghanouj and hummus, but dolmas are interesting to me because of the unique textures and contrasting flavors all wrapped in grape leaves. I keep ordering dolmas to see which one I like best, and so far I'm a fan of the dolmas here too.  The beef souvlaki and chicken souvlaki are full of flavor. However, the beef souvlaki was cooked \"well done\" even though we ordered it \"medium rare.\" The souvlaki was a bit drier than I'd like but I enjoyed it here better than some other Greek places I've had on the west side.   The restaurant itself is bright inside. The menu is very clear and easy to read when you order at the counter. Once you order, you can seat yourself anywhere and kick back and watch tv (like the BCS championship game for instance, which was playing when I walked in tonight to pick up food to go).   Call me biased based on convenience, but I am just so happy to have Greek food this close to me, so I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I could for that alone! (Even if my sole purpose was to get baklava only to go)."}
{"text":"Excellent food and Great selection!! Friendly people and a great selection of food. Will come back :-)"}
{"text":"Great I've always liked this place, one problem is some of the food like the Philly Cheese Stake does not taste the best and the bread is really hard so they should work on foods like that, but overall I think it's pretty good!"}
{"text":"It wasn't that good. Los ice is so much better. The fired were a waste of money. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Excellent place... Excellent food... manager corrected a billing issue with my card quick and swift"}
{"text":"Having been to Greece multiple times, I can say the food here is as authentic as you will find. The gyro meat is flavorful and well seasoned. The hummus and falafel are great. Big portions, you will not leave hungry. Definitely one of my \"go-to\" places ! Your order does take a bit long, but well worth it !"}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food for small place! Gyros are delishamf lamb is tasty and tender. They have a varied menu and decent portion sizes. I see alot of people call ahead for take out. Yummy food for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a local spot that my husband and I like to get take out from pretty often.  We love it!  I usually order the chicken kabob plate and my husband usually orders the combination plate and they are always delicious.  The rice is my favorite!  Great local greek food and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I stopped in today for  lunch. I had a gyro and it was very tasty. Great prices too! I will be back to try what else they've got."}
{"text":"I noticed we have a lot of pita restaurants, Gyro restaurants, Mediterranean restaurants in the area. I did the mistake of going food shopping hungry.. so after food shopping instead of just going home to make lunch I some how got sucked into coming here and getting a Gyro. The pita was so warm the meat was fresh. The tzatziki sauce that they put on the Gyro was super great a lot of flavor and really good when you dip it in your French fries. I also had to get some baklava when I was there. You can tell it's homemade it reminded me of how my aunts and grandparents made it when I lived in New Jersey. Overall this place is great for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Love the onion rings and gyros. Fast too. Got the order correct on the first call. Love the meat and they have good communication."}
{"text":"Place is less than stellar. I got the chicken kabob salad and it was less than stellar. Fries were gross and very soggy. Place is mediocre at best and they charge more than any other greek place around here. I wouldt go here again."}
{"text":"I am literally in this plaza twice a month and I have never seen this place.  It has a very \"chain\" feel to it.  Plasma tv menus, floor to ceiling Greek paintings, Greek colored everything.  I thought it would be very generic but the food was surprisingly good.  They use Kronos just like 90% of places you will go.  The pita was slightly over cooked like they didn't use enough oil but it didn't hurt the flavor.  They are a little too conservative on the Tzatziki for my taste so I would encourage you to order some extra.  The fries are boring, but I'm picky.  Overall they offered a good value if your in the area."}
{"text":"Great first time experience for both my pregnant wife and I. Both the fresh food and the service were amazing! I am definitely coming again. Ben was awesome at accommodating our orders."}
{"text":"Food was so tasty and fresh! The service was very friendly and the prices were reasonable. Would definitely recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Very Good Food :) I ordered the Shawarma Pita with Greek fries. Shawarma was very tender and had a very good taste to it. Greek Fries were really good as well. Priced well. If you're in the area definitely try them out..."}
{"text":"First time here and coming back, soon. Excellent. Meat was fresh, pita was not dried out, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I had a gyro sandwich is was good. Definitely better than average but not the best ever. Prices are a tad bit high."}
{"text":"The food was great, service was friendly and it was a perfect day to dine outside. Food was reasonably priced and prepared quickly. It's way out of the way, but if I'm ever in the neighborhood I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Alex W. - Seriously? I was there with my family eating. Your review does not add up to what truly happened. 20minutes? lol You made is all uncomfortable with your attitude. I heard you state you'll be making comments on Yelp that's why I was so curious to see if you did actually do it. Sadly, you did.   I've been going to this place for YEARS. Their portion for the price is great. I usually share my plate with my husband or kids...meat with rice/fries, hummus, salad, AND pita bread. The kids love it. Their food always tastes great and is fresh. They make it right there for YOU. No microwave or preheated food. This is not a drive thru fast food place. No employee in the area is allowed to smoke cigarettes in front of the store. I know because I live there. So your statement about not washing hands after smoking...FALSE!   Did you ever wonder how they got 'A' if they were so disgusting? That's right 'A' from Environmental Health Division.    Getting away from negative feedback/drama, I truly love this place. I truest their quality because I take my kids and people that visit me all the time. Quality and quantity is an A+. The cashiers have always been nice and friendly to us. The best part is, every time I order my favorite dish, it's the exact spices/flavor from my previous orders. So no surprises or disappointments there :)"}
{"text":"Food is good. 1 star based solely on the customer service. Keep going back because it's the only greek type place in the neighborhood. Have now visited 3 times, once as a dine in customer and twice for carry out. Every single time the order has been wrong. Now if they could get their staff in gear and get out the right orders this place would be a solid 3-3.5 for me.  EDIT: 4th time is a charm!!! Kind of sucky that 3 of 4 orders were wrong. But, we will be giving it another shot hoping we were just really unlucky. Food was good as always, tastes even better when the order is right!!!  EDIT #2: Seems like the customer service is fixed! Food has been awesome but more importantly the staff is paying attention to detail and doing a great job!"}
{"text":"Pita's are top notch.  I don't eat red meat and they have Chicken on a spit.  Their food is excellent and I go there as often as I can."}
{"text":"We just moved here and were trying various restaurants and saw this place.  WOW - we are going to be return customers.  Clean location, friendly service and the food was off the chart great.  The Gyros were just fantastic with great, great flavor.  I cannot wait to go back and try some of the other combination dishes.  You cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Awesome Gyros ! Nice selection ! Reasonably priced. $6.99 Gyros Combo Special is muy a la bomb ez vous !!"}
{"text":"I was heading into chipotle for a burrito and the line was crazy long.  This place is right next door and unfortunately for them, they only had one other couple in there. I ordered the chicken schwarma plate. It was delicious. I'm glad that I skipped the burrito- I feel much healthier for eating this. The burrito would have put me to sleep!"}
{"text":"I have too many good things to say about this place: - I got the veggie steak shawirma, (expensive for me but portions are huge). - I have been to Greece and this is some of the best Greek food I've had. - Super clean in lobby and they have an open kitchen.  - Cook brings food out to guests when he can. The cashier was genuinely friendly, helpful, and asked about my day.   So: authentic, delicious, great customer service.  The only thing I wish is that they sold pita bread and hummus in bulk!"}
{"text":"I order Gyro salad the tsaziky sauce was not a autentical sauce to sour ,tomatoes not really good ,the meat was cold, this is not Traditional Gyro I use to eat in other places"}
{"text":"We have been driving by this and thought it was time to give it a try.  I am so glad we did.  The staff was so friendly and the shop was spotless.    We both had the Gyro's and split an order of fries.  The Tzatziki sauce was great.  We ordered extra on the side. The portions are big...Everything was hot, and seasoned perfectly.  This is a great place to get a quick bite and relax.    We will be back."}
{"text":"As Good As It Gets .. For authentic quick and conveniently located Greek food this is it.  baklava it's just how it is overseas get some for dessert you'll love it."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars or maybe half a star. Extremely bad service. Ordered a hot dog for my daughter and the lady brought us a hamburger. Even though it was her mistake she said we'd have to pay another 6bucks to get the hot dog, even though my daughter won't even eat burgers and the hot dog was our original order. What happened to customer service? I mean come on! We already paid for the meal, and a hot dog probably cost them 25cents. We will never go back here, and it's a shame because we are always in this area for business."}
{"text":"There is a shortage of great places to eat in north Peoria (NoPo). This place helps! Super yummy gyros and fries.  We will definitely come back many more times!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty gyro pita, and the hummus is good too, especially on a fry with some tzatziki. Not the best Greek food I've ever had, but this makes for a tasty lunch and it's quick. Happy it's close for when I need my Greek fix."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Great customer service, staff was very nice & professional. I ordered the Firefighter plate, I was hesitant at first because it was not a traditional Gyro plate, & most of the time I try and order food as its normally served. The hot peppers & onions were amazing in this plate, they added a more bold flavor to the Gyro's. This will be my staple order on my future visits here. Good prices, good portions, great customer service."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. Customer service is awful and the food isn't much better. At best, this is the overpriced McDonald's version of Greek food. You'd be better off going to a real Mediterranean restaurant. They were blaring music in Spanish and we ate our food while taking in the smell of cleaning products as the cashier was cleaning toilets at the end of the night. Pathetic excuse for a dining facility."}
{"text":"Great little casual place. Beef and lamp gyros first rate. Philly cheese steak very good and chicken very good too. Most people take out."}
