{"text":"Excellent service good atmosphere not smokey and seemingly good crowd of people. Priced well and has CRT video poker machines which feel very nostalgic. Relatively quiet. AND a nice dining area if you don't want to hang out in the bar. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Rachelle and Crystal are awesome bartenders they make you feel like family.... bring your family and friends for some good music and good company"}
{"text":"You would never know how good it is until you walk into the bar. The people are great and the food is good. You rock Kristine!"}
{"text":"Let me put this bar on the map!  I absolutely love the local bar scene and it doesnt get more local than this place.  Loose slots and hot bartenders.. This hidden jewel is a great time whatever the time may be.  The adjacent cafe serves food from 9A till 11P for those gamblers who like a little food with there winnings."}
{"text":"Love this place great local bar food! and service was awesome! Denise was very friendly and even talked to us about her farm at her home she was very sweet and brought out coloring books and crayons for my 3 yr old super sweet!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza to go very light on toppings and sauce asked to reorder said no not very good customer service"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite neighborhood bar. Super friendly down to earth staff . The crowd is always awesome and mostly working class laid back people. Bartenders are accommodating and on point. Definitely recommend this bar for hanging out on a chill night with any sort of company! Especially love bartender Rachelle!!! She is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic good food and the bartender is the nicest bartender I've ever had she is so nice and caring she even offered when my friend got sick to help drive her home"}
{"text":"Don't ever eat at the restaurant here. I ordered a salad that was served to me with moldy cucumbers, old tomatoes and onions along with watery and soggy lettuce. Our server was nice but her foreign accent was so thick,there was a communication difficulty when I was trying to tell her the salad was basically crap. I asked her if it was fresh and she said it was! So I asked,\"Do you know how long it takes for vegetables to grow mold?\". I also ordered the chicken fingers with a side of ranch and a pepperoni pizza. I noticed that all three (Chicken finger batter,Ranch,and Pizza) had the same parsley spice mixed in them and thought it was very weird. The pizza and chicken fingers were good and tasty though. The experience reminded me of an episode of \"Kitchen Nightmares\"."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years! I love the waitresses, they know my family and always take good care of us. Burgers are the best!"}
{"text":"As long as you are playing the bartender will take care of you and what ever you want its done. The best drinks in town."}
{"text":"I placed a decent sized order here being we've had there pizza before and despite there bad customer service we decided to give them another shot. When I was on the phone placing my order the lady that usually answers was rude and had a bad attitude. she was rushing me through my order and made me feel like she didn't want to do her job.I thought maybe she was really busy but when I picked up my food there was no one there and again I got an attitude from her. On top of that she got my order wrong. We will not be returning to this place or ordering from them again."}
{"text":"This Place blows, unless you like piece of shit places to go to. Went there with NO ONE in the dining room area. Took 15 minutes to get a drink order. Waitress had friends come in and wasn't coming back over to get our drinks to us. Didn't know it took nearly a half an hour to get one water and one budlight. We decided to leave to poor service. Place need to clean house and get new staff. FYI the server was a lady with long blond hair, older with glasses. And this was on 12-13-15. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this place to anyone such a joke."}
{"text":"First visit today.  My husband had the burger and I had the grilled chicken philly cheese steak.  Both were yummy.  Waitress was very personable and the atmosphere was casual small-town.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered a fried appetizer combo plate, and instead of giving me a fair amount of everything I only got 2 mozzarella sticks and a few fried zucchini and the rest onion rings. They were out of mushrooms as well. I asked to sub mushrooms and got angry and said I get whatever I get. Not a good place"}
{"text":"By far the best wings in North Las Vegas! I order from here a few times a month. Their specials are incredible and delivery time is always 30 minutes or less!"}
{"text":"This place has horrible food.  Who can mess up scrambled eggs obviously this place can they were watery and made with what tasted like old recycled grease. The only thing that was good was the waitress she was very nice, if I was her I'd look for a better Restuarant, I think Denny's is hiring."}
{"text":"Im so Damn Mad right now I cant see straight I ordered lunch for my boss and I to be delivered and I got the fuckin short end of the stick! I had the BLT sandwich and it came with extra burnt bacon and rancid mayo. I called back and asked them to replace my meal with fresh Items the owner who happens to be the cook in her russian voice said no im not replacing anything...Really you dont know who you fucking. If you like eating here you wont for long. because im going to see to it that this place get every demerit thats coming to them."}
{"text":"Ordered the pancake sandwich.2 eggs, thick ham steak stuffed in between 2 large pancakes. Very tasty!! Although its attached to a bar its not bad. Theres a dividing wall. The service is good, reasonable prices and specials. Restaurant could us some renovating. Just adding some tv's & painting the ceiling would be a great improvement. I'd come back. They have pizza too..haven't tried it but would!"}
{"text":"Don't eat there, my wife got sick after eating there , danger, I have the UMC bill to prove it , danger"}
