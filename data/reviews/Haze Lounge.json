{"text":"Seriously awesome.  Ambiance is great. Shisha flavours are great.  Food is great.  Service is great.  On weekends it can get busy if you have very large parties, so I recommend reservation.  Otherwise I love going there."}
{"text":"At first the place was great. The ambiance was nice and classy. We got there around 7:00 and we were seated right away. Thats where the good stopped. Unfortunately,  the waiting staff was not good. We waited so long to get served which was annoying. Then to get our bill, it took 25 mins.  I understand it gets really busy, but as a first timer at this lounge, not a good first impression at all."}
{"text":"Great place. They just launched their new flavor (PAAN MINT) on 27 January and we were actually the 1st ones to buy that sheesha. And the server even mentioned this is the 1st one sold to you so in return he offered us FREE DRINKS. He took our orders but he never served us drinks which was quiet disappointing, the reason I am giving 3 stars else its a 5 star place"}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE! They are so rude and condescending. The food is hit or miss, portions are tiny, and most tastes packaged or canned. The staff are so blatantly rude and they don't treat you as a paying customer, more like they're doing you some favour by serving your table. Absolutely terrible, stay away unless you enjoy paying to be treated poorly."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm writing this review is because their service has definitely declined recently. A few of us went in 45 minutes before Iftar. The two of us that had arrived placed our order and told the server \"please come back when our other two friends arrive to take their order as they are fasting as well\". The other two came after ten minutes and the server was no where to be seen. She never checked up on us even once until one of us had to get up physically and ask them to take the orders. The fact that we had arrived 45 minutes early, yet the server didn't have the courtesy to check back even though we mentioned we were fasting is a bit ridiculous. At this point, two of us received our food and the other two didn't get served until 9:30 HALF AN HOUR AFTER IFTAR EVEN THOUGH WE CAME EARLY???? They didn't even seem apologetic and we literally had to get up two times to say \"hey we're fasting can you guys see where our food is\". The fact that they prestige themselves as a halal restaurant yet they couldn't even offer a glass of water or an appetizer (like other restaurants definitely do if their service is slow (read: bad) was highly disappointing. I've been to a plethora of restaurants in the GTA and I've never felt this way before. I get that it's a lounge and it's meant to be laid back and laissez faire, however, I feel that that should not take away from the professionalism and customer service of the restaurant. In addition, we had like three servers, which isn't what you expect in a \"higher end\" kind of place. It kind of felt like everyone was all over the place and could not care less about the customers. This kind of attitude is okay for the shisha lounge area, but I don't believe it's suitable when you're actually there to dine and sitting in the dining area. At the end of it, we had all paid our bills and didn't receive a receipt - at which point we realized we all paid a lot. Between the four of us we paid around $140, which didn't make sense considering the food and shisha we got. We decided to do the math and realized that we had all been overcharged. At this point, I decided to call them and let them know, but the \"manager\" gave me attitude, instead of being apologetic. We trusted them enough by not asking for a receipt, yet we felt like they exploited us. They charged us 15% gratuity on everyone's bill even though it was four of us - on top of which we also tipped. The biggest issue here is not about the few dollars in change, it's about principle. The server should have at least let us know before charging us for gratuity that is supposed to be charged on five people or more (so the guy on the phone claimed) WE WERE ONLY FOUR. I'm sure the server could count to four lol. On top of that, the service was way below average so we were nice to even give a tip. At any restaurant I've been to, they let you know beforehand about gratuity, instead of just charging you. We weren't even supposed to be charged it.... 

That being said, the shisha was good, so no complaints there. I would only recommend this place for shisha, not for food. The management should really think about creating some sort of an organized structure, instead of being so laid back in their customer service and attention to detail while charging people."}
{"text":"Wait time is long. Not enough seating. No reservations. The parmesan sandwich was not good. 

Calamari wasn't bad. Sheesha was good. 
The workers are super nice. 
Drinks were good. 
It should have a better system for seating people.
Lots of waiting on Friday night."}
{"text":"Horrible service!! Staff do not check on you unless you wave them down. If you're only going to give three coals you should make a note to check on your customers.

Food took an hour to come out...at least it was good. Don't bother ordering a pineapple head!! It was not carved out...they simple dumped a bit of flavor on top of half a pineapple and covered it up with fruits and flowers to make it look impressive...it was a joke. And when we took the foil off to check under, one of the servers told us \"you can't do that\". 

Servers walk around like they hate their lives...you almost feel sorry for them. 

Shisha is good, but not worth all the negatives to come here."}
{"text":"It's a good place with great options all around.

The only reason it is getting a 3 is because the staff are rude.  The host was rude and then the server pointed out that there was a tip option when handing the machine for payment.  For that, he received no tip.  

It is not my fault that the majority of your customers are high school/university students.  If that is your target market, expect very little in the way of tips, and deal with it.  When someone who is clearly older and well-dressed (in a suit), do not try and force me into tipping you, I will not."}
{"text":"Awesome place for brunch. I went with 3 of my girlfriends and we had a great time. The staff was super nice and the restaurant itself was really clean. 

The smoothies and milkshakes were very good. 
The food was really good  the Canadian Breakfast Poutine was so big! I wasnt expecting it.

Good thing to note they use beef bacon not pork so it makes the meal just that much better.

If you order the Belgian Benedict and like the york runny let them know or they will make the egg hard. It was still good overall.

Traditional English was good,  if you want a basic breakfast. Simple and yummy.

Only weird thing was the music was 50's and the restaurant is a hookah bar... oh and they were playing nascar on the tv... so if you go dont be surprised they arent playing more traditional music."}
{"text":"Firstly get there earlier on Saturday to find a spot as I wasn't able to get a table to I would not comment on the Shisha/ Hookah. They would have gotten half a star more if that stuff was decent. But i will update on that once I go their again to try some.

I did take a round to check the entire place out before leaving. The place looks and feels like a lounge which is quite good and they have made good use of every corner possible. Hence, too many people smoking and not enough ventilation. The staff at the door was quite friendly and tried smile as much as possible when trying to get people seated. The staff went in and out of the kitchen as the places was pumping down with customers. 

All in all if you are looking for an open space, this is not it as the place is quite full of smoke inside but if you don't mind the smoke then this is the place to smoke up some fruity flavored Shisha."}
{"text":"The service is great but the food is awful. Probably wouldn't recommend anything on the menu as I've been here multiple times and tried many items on their menu. This place is super packed every time we come in. You're lucky if they don't squeeze you in the corner seats next to the kitchen."}
{"text":"Definitely a Fan of this place.

Ambiance/Decor -- Great! Up class type, a bit fancy -- great for dates or even group hangouts

Shisha - one of the best you will get

Price: $$$ it is High. about $20-22 after tax (for regular shisha) --- i feel that the price is a bit high, even though the shisha is great - still, i would say drop a couple dollar - about 15 would be great.


Food: Also very good -- however, i have not tried everything. I have had Jalapeno Poppers, Club Sandwich, Chicken Parmesan Pasta, Chicken Parmesan Sandwich, Steak Sandwich and Oreo Milkshake (from what i remember) --- delicious

Price: $$ -- its high - but i think price is fair (for most things), their portions are big too -- like club sandwich -- was huge ! comes with Salad as well! 

However, when ordering Shisha AND Food -- the costs are HUGE 

We end up coming just to do shisha and not eat, since that by itself costs a lot. 

I feel like about $25-28 for Shisha + a decent meal would be good. 

Lastly,

Service: I feel its gotten really slow. Even in non-busy days sometimes shisha takes good 20-25 mins. Not sure why."}
{"text":"Service: Came here on a Monday night with some friends celebrating a birthday. Fairly busy even for a weekday. Our servers Omar and Darius went above and beyond and were nothing but hospitable. Even though it was busy they still made sure to check on us.  They even played some Drake on request. They initially put us in the dining area. After dinner we moved to the lounge. 

Food:
We were quite a a large group but our food came out quite quickly. We got the BBQ ribs which were so good with so much meat. The chicken shawarma platter was amazing too! Came with salad and hummus and fries.  For drinks we recommend the Ferraro rocher shake! 

Shisha: we had the spartan which is their take on the blue mist. Very smooth and didn't burn for the 5 hours we were there. 

Only recommendation (from my wife) please have an area with better selfie lighting"}
{"text":"Best spot in th GTA .Been coming for the past three years and I'm never disappointed. Thank you Waleed and the remaining of the staff for making every night a great night !!!"}
{"text":"Love this place specially in afternoon. Love the interior, shisha is very strong which gives me headache , service is pretty fast which is good . Love their chicken wings with peri peri yum ."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 stars because of the great atmosphere and the loungey vibe. Nice modern decor, they have little private booths, and 2 seperate seating areas. Food is good, not great. I've been here twice now, at it's always come hot and fresh.

What utterly sucks about this place is the waiters and waitresses. Yes, they're all good looking, but completely retarded. Slightly offensive, with minimal social skills. They forget orders, don't check up on you, make snide remarks like \"you're ordering too much\" etc etc. This place also makes you pay for water. I would pay for it, if they deserved to have such high standards. 

fire every server, and start from fresh."}
{"text":"Fun place, good hookah, yummy food, and the service is ok unless you have Ozzy and then the service is A+. The only reason I'm giving it 5 stars is Ozzy, take him out and it's 2-3 stars. This is the best place to pre-party before heading to The X Club."}
{"text":"The interior is lovely. Matte black and red; very urbane looking. Lots of shisha variety to choose from and some very exquisite and unconventional flavours aswell. Their chicken parmesan sandwich is very tasty. Service is lacking, however. Had to ask 3 times before getting a garlic sauce. Young and disorganized servers. Music is decent.

Also you can't pay with debit. How irritating."}
{"text":"The server spilled the drinks on me and my new js 
The chair or sofa is to low the music was ok the drink were amazing that and that alone is the reason 3 stars"}
{"text":"The food was great, the shisha was decent (I've had better) and the environment was cool. The music was too loud either. The best part was probably the service. The guy service us had a great attitude, was helpful with suggestions, and actually checked up on us a few times to makes sure everything was okay. I've been to a lot of hookah bars and people rarely come back to your table after you're done ordering. It's worth a visit if you're in the area, but it's not a \"go out of your way\" place."}
{"text":"Haze has great shisha flavours to pick from and I love the atmosphere but the main thing that they need to improve on is their service. The last time I went with a friend, we waited 25mins for garlic bread with cheese. Every time we've gone it seems like you have to wait some time before anyone attends to you when you need them, but that last visit was memorable because you would think someone would offer some type of discount to remedy the situation and nothing was offered. Overall, I will return but service needs to improve"}
{"text":"The place has a decent ambience, which is probably its only selling point. Service was mediocre, our food took over an hour to arrive. The food was overpriced for its quality, I ordered the quinoa salad which barely contained any quinoa and had way too much dressing on it. The sheesha was average, I have had better sheesha in Mississauga. Overall, the place is overrated. Will most likely avoid visiting again."}
{"text":"In terms of a hookah joint Haze is great. Almost all of the one's I have been to in Scarborough are completely run down with ripped furniture, and terrible service. The atmosphere in Haze wonderful and what I like most it's very clean and has a nice layout. The hookah was also great and the service was not bad either.

What threw me off however is that they do not offer to give you any tap water at all and you have to pay for bottled water, in terms of food I ordered a Philly cheese steak sandwich which was over-filled with sauce and it felt like the meat had been heated up in a microwave as it was only luke-warm at best. 

Overall I think Haze is a great place to hang out with a group of friends, I really liked the atmosphere and I will definitely be back, but this time I will just stick to the hookah rather than ordering food."}
{"text":"This is a great place for just hookah. Please don't expect much from the food - or the apps specifically. I remember this place having amazing food which really surprised me given that it is primarily a hookah bar. Things have changed.

We had the 
- Sriracha Fried Shrimp which weren't spicy at all given that they were fried in hot sauce.
- Chipotle Jalepeno Poppers were good. 
- Hummus was probably the worst I've tasted 

The place looks nice, its a nice date spot with really clean bathrooms. It is more of a younger crowd. We went on a Tuesday night around 9:30 and didn't have to wait - which is a rare thing at this place."}
{"text":"Been there couple of times but then stopped for about 6 months. I was in the area 3 days ago so i passed by and had the jalapeno poppers, steak , and grapemint shisha. Honestly everything was beyond amazing that actually surprised me. Portions are huge and the food is delicious and what a wonderful shisha right after your last bite. I recommend going there on weekdays and sit on the patio they have as there will be a waiting list in the weekends. Would go there everyday if i lived in that area."}
{"text":"The service here is quite poor. In the beginning while the restaurant was empty our server was quite helpful and was checking up on us. We got our starters pretty quickly but when we were ready to order our meal it took a really long time. They have this buzzer to press when you want to call a waiter after pressing it periodically for about 30 min our server came and apologized and told us that his coworkers buzzer watch was off and they didn't realize we had called. We may have believed him if he hadn't came by 15 min before and motioned that he would be with us in a moment. The food was alright, I had the calamari to start which was delicious and then had the chicken parmesan sandwich which was nothing special. Lots of places have great calamari that comes with much better service so I won't be back anytime in the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"BEST HOOKAH AND SERVICE IN TORONTO!!!

I recently visited Toronto and went to many hookah bars in the area. Since I smoke a lot back home, I knew exactly what I was looking for but just couldn't seem to find it..... Until I came to Haze Lounge! Very upscale and proper, this place is hookah at its finest. The staff there is so friendly and service is beyond anything I've ever seen! The manager there, Faizan, is what made our experience what it was. He treats everyone with respect and makes sure you get what you need. If anyone knows how to run a business, it's this guy! 

The last thing I have to add is the food, and I wasn't disappointed by that decision. Now, most hookah places will have good hookah and mediocre food or vice versa, but this place has BOTH! Even the food was better than any restaurant food I had while I was there! That says a lot since Toronto already has such amazing places to eat, but this one blew them out of the water!

If you're in the area and want quality hookah and food, Haze is where it's at! If I could choose one word to describe the atmosphere, hookah, service, cleanliness, and food; that word would be \"impeccable\"!"}
{"text":"Horrible wait times how ridiculous. Why should I be waiting 2 hours to be seated? Are your shisha's made of gold? Did the priest bless them? This is nonsense. There hasn't been a time I haven't come here and I haven't been made to wait for less than 40 minutes... You guys need to get a bigger place or start taking reservations for big parties because I just stood here watching maybe 10 diff people in different party numbers let in as we still wait. I work in the restaurant industry there is no precedence as to why you wouldn't take a bigger party above a few small ones."}
{"text":"Halal meat is served here, per verbal assurance from staff. Owners are also Muslim. Went here recently with a friend and was surprised how busy it was on a Sunday night (perhaps Spring Break?).  We had to wait at least 15 minutes for a table, but we ended up with a pretty good spot near the projection screen where they were showing the game.  We tried the Spartan Shisha (blue mist mix) as well as the grape-mint.  Both were good, although didnt seem to last very long (in terms of flavor).  We also had some snack foods like nachos (very good), jalapeno poppers (good) and garlic bread (also good).  Service was friendly and pretty good considering how busy the place was.  They have these \"call buttons\" at each table where you can press for service.  We tried it once, but it didnt seem to work properly.  Other than a few minor hiccups, we had an overall good experience here."}
{"text":"Avoid the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich. More mushrooms than beef, and no cheese at all. And it looked as if it came from a can or pre packaged meal on a roll."}
{"text":"Great place, great shisha, great vibe, great ambiance, and great food! So why is this 3/5? The service!! It's honestly a hit and miss. If you're lucky, you'll get your bill in less than an hour (I kid you not, we had to wait a whole hour to get our bill once-we timed it).
No pork. No alcohol. Just shisha and great food. 
Best of luck with the service though!"}
{"text":"I like this place alot. The decors trendy. Good hip pop vibe. They know the crowd.

Their mango smoothly is pretty good too :)

Recommend"}
{"text":"Its a great place to have shisha and hangout,  atmosphere is really nice too...  But the service is SOOOOO slow!!!  Even if there's 5 people in the lounge,  it takes the servers so long to even seat you.  I've been coming here for a long time hoping for a change before I put up the review but..  Now it's time!!!  People walk out from the back see you waiting and don't even seat you.   It's horrible.  Customer service is the key to success in this type of business..  And I agree with some comments..  Some of the waiters think too high of themselves and need to humble themselves. It shouldn't take 30 minutes to get a shisha.. I try to avoid going here as much as I can"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out although they're a little pricey (I almost fell out of my chair when I saw the $70 Shisha). Other than that the food is okay (once again a little pricey). Mediocre table setting ( the tables are lined with stones so they aren't a flat surface)-weird for a restaurant. Other than that I'd only go again if it was my last option."}
{"text":"How is this place always packed every time we come here? It's always a wait. But it's also always worth the wait. The shisha is always good and the atmosphere is always amazing. Though I would personally prefer a quieter place for shisha. 

I definitely recommend their oreo milkshake. I sometimes come here just for the shake!"}
{"text":"Like the food. The shisha is superb. They have a great selection of flavors and the staff is awesome. Came here with a couple of my friends and coming to relax is perfect. Awesome music playlist too."}
{"text":"I've had a horrible experience every time I've been there. I had a lot of hope for this spot. Let me start off by saying that their sheesha is over priced and not that great but their food is decent. I did however have a spider in my food once. Their customer service seems lacking but the people are nice. Their time management is horrible and the owner is not a nice fellow. He does not know anything about for customer service. The servers are the only reason the place is still running. For all these reasons I have to give Haze Lounge a 2. I hope that some day I can give you a 5."}
{"text":"Good food. Atmosphere is not bad. I just don't understand why they don't give customers tap water... If you want water buy a bottle. Even if you ignore the \"green\" aspect of not using plastic bottles, still doesn't make sense. Seems like they lack a very basic rule of customer service. Welcome your customers, seat them, offer water while they look over the menu.

Good option for late night food, and if you like shisha... But come on give your customers free water!"}
{"text":"I went here for a quick lunch during work. it was really good. the soups sounded and looked delicious however I went with the simple garden salad which was really good considering most places just toss the vegtables together. here everything was neatly placed from the spring mix to the cucumber. the salad was a little bit sour with the lemon juice but still tasty and filling. 
the restaraunt has 2 spaces to sit, a lounge and a dinning room. both are really comftorable however the lounge has shorter tables and boothes so if. you are going there to eat it should be in the dining room. Great service"}
{"text":"The hosts were nice. I liked the banana milkshake. I've had better chicken shawarma. Personally, I don't think shisha bars are for me. Im not a fan of people smoking so close to me. If I were to go back it would be to try the mocktails."}
{"text":"The ambience is OK, food is OK, shisha was good. This place is an overall OK place. I ranked it low because of the service. My group was of 5 people and we got there when the wait was about 25 minutes--no problem. We ended up waiting for 1 hour and 20 minutes and we didn't even get the area we requested. 

Food, drinks and shisha took forever to come out to us. The staff is extremely understaffed."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed by the service. The server was not very personable and did not check on my partner and I at all throughout our meal. 
I ordered the fajitas which were ok, nothing memorable and my partner ordered steak. Unfortunately they did not serve our meals at the same time. I received my fajitas and 15+ minutes later he received his steak. I realize we requested the steak to be well done which takes time, but the meals should have been better planned so that they could be served closer together. We asked a server where our steak was and informed him we had been waiting for some time. Instead of going to check on our order he first cleaned a nearby table and chatted with another staff member. I just feel he should have taken our concern with more importance and checked on our food right away. By the time he got his steak, I was almost done my food. I only started to eat before him to prevent it from getting cold. On a positive note the steak was pretty good and cooked like we asked.
Another aspect of the experience that I did not like is that the restaurant only serves bottled water which of course guests have to pay for. I think tap water should be an option, one for the cost and two because of the environmental impact. Only serving bottled water is not environmentally friendly!
Lastly, why are there only male servers? I would like to see a bit more diversity in that regards.
Positives- decent steak, nice ambiance, quiet enough to talk easily.
I probably won't return to this place. I didn't have shisha here so I can't comment on how good it is. If I want shisha I would most likely go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Just tried Haze Lounge for the first time this evening, nothing special about this place and the quality is below average, unfortunately.

To start off with the atmosphere, it's too dark, with some really dimmed light..and the ventilation system is close to none, to the point that everything around you is blurred,  so you're filled with smoke smells the second you walk in/out.

The hookah itself is way below average, the tobacco seems to be somewhat of a cheap herbal/organic brand. Which starts giving you headaches after few puffs.
Service is 'ok'..again, nothing special to make up for anything else..
We also ordered some drinks and sweets, again, all on average side.

I was actually given a \"verbal total\" for the amount owing when I asked for the bill, without even showing me a bill (which I think isn't even legal) , I paid by cash and I still do not have my bill/receipt.


Will not return to Haze Lounge!"}
{"text":"I would've have given this place 5 stars if the service would improve a bit. By this I mean the attitude of the staff. 
Let me start off with the positives, which made it get the 4 stars.
The ambience is amazing and very classy. I love the fact that you can order food along with the amazing selection of shisha/hookah flavors.
I love the way once you enter (after waiting in line for 20 minutes minimum) you are enveloped with a mixture of shisha aromas and all you see is this dimly lit misty room, filled with people that are well dressed.
The servers are also smart, with an all-black uniform. I did notice that they seem to hire their staff according to appearance. This is an obvious observation, which you will definitely agree on once you check this place out.
The first time I visited my table got the grilled cheese and shawarma. The serving sizes were ginormous! The food was good, but obviously the shawarma wasn't an authentic shawarma as you cant really expect them to have the whole rotisserie machine in their kitchen.  Another time we got the fried bounty dessert, which obviously would be good. The shisha was good and the waiter was very experienced with handling it. I unfortunately have never got the opportunity to try the paan flavored shisha, which apparently is the best but only served on certain days of the week.
So, the only downside I found was that the waiters seem to have a lot of arrogance. This bugged me a bit, but I decided to focus on the better things, such as the speed of the service.
Overall, this place is great for a date, or just a classy night out with friends. Also, apparently later at night a DJ would perform. 
I am glad this place opened up, as Mississauga seriously lacked good shisha places, whereby all other places seemed to be pretty sketchy."}
{"text":"I went out to Haze this past weekend for my birthday with family and friends. The service was amazing compare to other hookah lounges I have went to in the past. They accommodated our large group, we had a group of 12 and did not let us feel forgotten or overwhelmed. They have buttons on the table to get your servers attention instead of waiting a long period of time. Food was great as well, I order the Caesar salad with chicken it was delicious, they do have pretty large portions great if you like to have leftovers for later. Overall, great food, great hookah, and top of the line service. I know my guest will be coming here for they're future events."}
{"text":"I have come here several times over the years. 

To wrap it up:
- Coming past 8pm is a nightmare. Finding a seat in under an hour would be a blessing at this place, but overall? That's horrible. This location seriously needs to be expanded. 
- Entertainment could use some help. I understand the food is halal which is GREAT. But drinks should be available (i don't drink but it would still make the environment a little more cool bar-ish like & im sure a lot of others would appreciate that feature), belly dancers would make the experience more fun and lit too, also it would be kinda cool if it was like a fun feel like those shisha bars that you can mingle around the dance floor. 
- There's a lot of food complaints on this page.. I completely disagree, the food is great! I love it. 
- Prices are way too much. I mean they always were but especially recently the prices have been jacked up. The price of a regular shisha costs what a premium shisha used to cost.. wack.
- Shisha used to be pretty good, it's either become hella cheap, or it's herbal or something cause it's horrible now.. you can't get smoke out of it at all and it tastes so gross.
- EXPAND THE LOCATION. PLEASE. Seriously would help you guys profit so much too so why not!
- Service is so slow... you press the button 50 times and still don't have someone come to help you.. annoying
- Hire staff that doesn't think they're top shit lmao. I get it ur tryna look cute for the girls and guys but like.. ur at work. Relax. Act with customer service and elegance. 
- I love the look of the place, hella classy upscale look. I like the table tops (although the table r  kinda too low and annoying) and couches and curtains. I can appreciate the TV's as well.


I would def come back, it's probably one of the best shisha places but there is A LOT of room for improvement. It's a nice upscale typa chill spot with friends."}
