{"text":"The food is good, the service is slow. Our server took our drink order with the pizza special. Our server then set down with customers for 10 minutes. We never received our order until I told Lisa about my drinks. Lisa found my beer still sitting at the bar. I asked Lisa to find Our server. Two minutes later Server show up with the pizza while I was on my way out of the door. This is the second time for bad service with this server. I may come back, but she can't serve me Again.  Thanks Lisa"}
{"text":"Customer service will make or break you. In the case tonight, it totally broke them. The server I had was horrible. She was very impatient as if we were bothering her while she's doing her job, go figure. She brought our food and then I didn't see her again until I had to hunt her down for the check. The food was not good at all. The pizza wasn't anything to write home about and I've had much better potato skins. I remember going to Pacer's when they were on 260th and I had a much better experience I'm not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"I pass this place often traveling down or up I-90 and eventually I had to stop by right? They have a  \"Best Ribs in America\" slogan, so naturally I had to test It out. Overall the experience was good. The spare ribs pictured were not the best but also not the worst. Nothing about the rib stood out to me. Also ordered were Asian Chili wings, which I thought were great. I certainly enjoyed them more than the ribs. Overall the food was good and the service was good. The only reason this isn't rated higher is the setup inside. The place is a a lot smaller than it looks, which is shocking. The seating situation could use some help, it almost feels like ppl are on top of each other. With that being said the service was still great, but without calling ahead or hoping for a slower night I can imagine seating could be aggravating for a potential customer. But you can tell this place has regulars which shows you how good the food is. My only recommendation is to look into the furniture or seating arrangement to make better use of the limited space."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed while visiting this restaurant recently. We usually order our dinner to go and have a drink while we're waiting.   Our bartender, Suzy, couldn't have been more rude that night.  She was gruff, loud and short tempered.  She moved back and forth past us many times waiting on other customers frequently. Finally after sitting and waiting to place our order for almost 30 minutes, we asked another waitress if we could just get a drink. The other waitress told Suzy and she says loudly...\"You'll just have to be patient and sit and wait\". If I hadn't been tired from a long day and had felt like driving to another restaurant I would have.  The only thing that made up for her nasty attitude was that, as usual, the dinner was wonderful. That was the ONLY reason we will go back!! WE WANT OUR OLD WAITRESS BACK!!!!"}
{"text":"The service at the bar was very good. Reasonably priced draft beer and good selection. I had the spare ribs with Cole slaw and home fries. The Cole slaw was store bought. Nothing special. The homefries were good but undercooked. The ribs were cooked perfectly. Browned and tender. The ribs were well sauced but the sauce was bland to me. I would give 4 stars if I had liked the sauce more"}
{"text":"Amazing ribs!!!  Can't wait for next time.   Great bar to watch a game and enjoy some awesome food."}
{"text":"Great local place Always a winner in the neighborhood  Great wings great prices great place to watch the game  Plus it's happy hour prices from 4 to 7"}
{"text":"The burger was off the hook and the bartender Kaitlyn really Pleasant and nice she created me a nice drink I really enjoyed it I will come back here again!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but service was terribly slow. Visited at lunch time on a weekday and it took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive. I consider the Lakewood location to be much better. Seems to have a decent beer selection as well as liquors."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick burger & some awesome ribs!! Pacers has the BEST RIBS!!  You really gotta have them!"}
{"text":"Ok , food looks real good but didnt eat , drinks were made well"}
