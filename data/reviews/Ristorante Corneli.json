{"text":"This place was amazing! We were just trying to act like locals around Montreal and decided to give it a try since it looked really nice from the outside. The lady who received us, who seemed to be the daughter of the owner, was very nice to us and made sure to make us feel comfortable regarding the language barrier. All the waiters seemed to be in a very good mood, so nice and smiley. Always checking on us. 

The food was exceptionally good, so good we even wanted to come back in the night, but the kitchen was already closed. Would recommend the Margherita Pizza, Fettuccine with Cream and Chicken, and the Penne with Salmon. All great plates, and also very light compared to other Italian places. Such a great find!"}
{"text":"My rating is more 2.5. Food is decent, but service was pretty rude. Would recommend coming here on weekends, i heard they had better waiters on weekends. 

Came here with family and family friends.
We took some entrées salmon tartar (pretty good) and calamari (also good) and for main, pasta and pizza. 
The food was decent, the salty taste of the parma pizza was too overpowering on taste of the pizza. 

The service was not the best. The attitude of our waitress did not seem professional. The way she was addressing us and even the other waitress who came to give us our doggy bags was rude. I came here with a regular customer, and he told me that the service in the weekend is a lot more professional and overall better. 

The atmosphere is nice, great for family, friends, couples! Pricing is decent if not a bit overpriced, but i didn't feel like money was totally wasted."}
{"text":"We found this place when looking for somewhere to go in Little Italy. The restaurant has a prime location and parking shouldn't be a problem. The restaurant itself looks beautiful, very romantic, yet family-style. The seats are all upholstered, the walls are covered with countless photos from their decades of business, the room is spacious. Service is amazing, friendly and bilingual. The menu is great, with unique and classic Italian options. Their Caesar salad was basic and delicious. They have a variety of appetizer pizzas all of which are well-prepared. I ordered their gnocchi, which was an amazing dish. It was simple, nothing that really elevated it. However, that was okay because the flavors were traditional and the gnocchi was so soft. They nailed the texture and the authentic Italian flavor combinations. Their lasagna was so good. It was so thick and had a wonderful ratio of pasta to meat to cheese. Presentation was amazing. Portion sizes are generous and all ingredients tasted fresh. Their pasta with salmon was extremely delicious. This was one of the better meals I have had in the past year and I can't wait to venture back here when in the area."}
{"text":"You can't beat the location or the atmosphere and its heated terrace full of laughing people beckoned...

The food however is an entirely different story.

At best, it's bland (pappardelle) or over seasoned (soup/mozzarella di bufala) and at worst it's completely inedible as was the case with their pizza.
The margherita pizza arrived a steaming mess of gooey cheese and tiny specs of basil - fit for a .99cent slice place. It tasted like rubbery, bland cheese and undercooked dough with salt thrown in for good measure. 

I'm not the type to complain or send food back but when the waitress cleared my near full plate away and asked if I wanted a doggy bag I instinctively blurted \"no, thanks it's inedible.\" 

The service couldn't be faulted and I was surprised when the waitress brought my bill and told me that she didn't charge me for the pizza since I clearly didn't enjoy it. She explained that their chef returned to Italy and they had a new cook working and asked what I didn't enjoy in order to give him feedback. 

I've never eaten there under the previous chef so I can't comment as to whether there is a marked difference; however, if you're looking for good pizza I would go pretty much anywhere else. 

If you're looking for a great atmosphere in little Italy and pleasant staff and a great terrace, go here and don't order the pizza."}
{"text":"solid authentic Italian food in an old world setting.  This family restaurant has operated in the city for decades and they know Italian. I will definitely return for the wine list alone."}
{"text":"I found the food a little bland. Nice decor, good service but food needs work."}
{"text":"Great Italian.  I was craving pasta and Ristorante Corneli did not disappoint.  Get the polenta and mushroom appetizer, it's delicious.  The spaghetti bolognese was cooked just al dente but had perhaps a bit too much sauce.  It was also bit odd the be served with a meat ball, but none the less still very delicious.  The outdoor seating was very pleasant and the large umbrellas do a good job of blocking the sun."}
{"text":"We ended up here after wandering Little Italy looking for a pizza place. We were able to get a nice table for 2 by the window early on a Friday night without a reservation. The waiter quickly caught on to the fact that we were in no rush and gave us plenty of room to enjoy our drinks and appetizers. We tried the fried calamari and I had the Parma pizza (tomato sauce, mozzarella, prosciutto, arugula, and Parmesan). Although the Parmesan was a bit sparse on the pizza, the wood burning oven really brought the crust together. The Sangiovese red wine was quite a hit as well. 

Definitively recommend for Italian cuisine to please the whole family: a wide menu of options with authentic flavours. It does feel a bit more main stream than a mom and pop Italian shop (and the fact that it's right on St-Laurent would contribute to this), but still made for a great lively evening."}
{"text":"For an appetizer I started with a caprese salad that was ok. I then had the gnocchi with meat sauce rather than the standard tomato sauce. It was great. The place was constantly busy. 

Don't eat dessert here though.  Go next door for the gelato and espresso coffee. Both were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and tried both the pasta and the pizza. For appetizers I had the veal meatballs which were quite good. The portions are very generous so at least you won't leave hungry. The pasta is very good; homemade and flavorful. The pizza is a different story; the dough is heavy and soggy from all the cheese they put"}
{"text":"Delicious food and family atmosphere. I went here with my husband, child, and my parents. The cheese tortellini with rosée sauce was full of bright flavor. The lamb shank (ossobucco) was out of this world. Service was fast and friendly. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We went there on a thursday 'Ladies' night\" wanting italian food. The starters were blend, the pizze greasy beyond imagination, and the martinis full of so many other things you could even taste it. This was a real disappointment. If you want good italian (or just good) food walk further!"}
{"text":"The service here is impeccable. 
After reading several reviews on Yelp, we decided to give this place a try. We got there early in the evening, around 5:30 p.m. as waiters were setting up for a night of large groups for holiday parties. They rearranged tables in the bar area to make room for three of us so we could sit and stay a while. We ended up staying for nearly five hours!
The wine we ordered was delicious, and our server, Guillame, walked each of us through the menu. He was happy to translate French words for each of us, and made recommendations based on our hunger and preferences. 
Guillame also made the birthday girl in our group feel very special. He brought out a cake with sparklers on top, and led the bar area in singing \"happy birthday.\" Later he brought over a round of shots to the table and even took one himself. 
Overall really great service, delicious food (especially the chicken with veggies and goat cheese) and a perfect location. Other guests were fantastic as well and made the meal feel like we were at home!"}
{"text":"Loved the dinner and desert here - so delicious!  From the very first bite of salad to the last bite of desert, the food was outstanding. Well balanced, full, rich flavors without any heaviness. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Decided to try a new restaurant in little Italy.   It was a nice evening so decided to stop here and eat on the patio thats in the street.   Service wasnt that great.  Waited 10 minutes for my Moretti beer, only to be told they ran out???   Waitress also forgot to give us little bread sticks and oils to start, and they came by later with bread - we had to ask for - and she didnt even realize she forgot to give us some in the first place.   The Minestrone soup was good.   I had the Veal Parmagiana and past for the main course.   It was good, nothing special."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere were fantastic. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that service was a bit slow and disorganized. Otherwise this is a fine choice for Little Italy."}
{"text":"Really nice and spacious restaurant. Food was delicious. Staff was friendly, overall service was good. The four of us ordered a few dishes to share and sat outside in the patio. Highly recommend the bruschetta. It was perfect!! Also the Gorgonzola mussels were great. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Had a team holiday dinner there. Great food: fried calamari, mussels, pasta appetizer, salmon with avocado. The cannoli and coffee were really good. The place was a little loud, but was ok for a group of people. Good service."}
{"text":"Had the spaghetti  with meatballs.  It was delicious! 
Sat on the terrace on a beautiful  night. 
The service was generally  good but our waiter was an absolute sweetheart.  Very friendly  staff and great music. 
The terrace is basically on the street  but it's very authentic.  Reminds me of NYC. 
All in all very good. Definitely  a good choice especially in the summer."}
{"text":"Good food but not necessarily wow. The appetizer was great, I had the melted brie with honey and nuts, but my pizza was just ok. Make sure you don't order both for yourself since both appetizer and pizza are big!"}
{"text":"I was at this establishment for a b-day party with about 30 people on a Saturday night. Place was pretty much full, and being so it was very crowded to move around or to be seated comfortably. It was a fixed menu so I can't talk for the whole menu but what I can critic is what I ate. For starters Sausage was cut way to thin so over cooked on top of mushy rapini. The prosciutto was cut way to much in advance it actually turned brown from the cantaloupe juices. There were also over cooked calamari which seemed you had to chew for ever. The entre was a wilted Caesar salad. Which means it sat in the hot kitchen to long!  As for the main dish the veal lemon & veal Marsala were both very tuff not to mention the under cooked pasta. There's al denté but border line raw is a little much. Service was at best non existent. If you wanted something from the bar, had to wait 15-20 min. Unacceptable! Will not return, much better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I feel the meal was very overpriced for lunch. The food wasn't that good. After being in Little Italy in NYC last weekend it didn't compare. $5 per soda is too much."}
{"text":"We got there around 1830 on a Saturday night. We did not have reservations. That's the first thing they asked us, no problem. We were seated in this awkward space to the side of the hostess stand where people would constantly bump up against you when they went to ask for a table. There really should not have been a table there at all. Too much traffic. However, there was a light above us, so we could actually see our menu and meals. I saw other patrons using their cellphone lights to read their menus. 

Our waiter was very nice and not intrusive. He seemed very busy, though. There were several large groups that came in and they seemed to be the priority. Again, not a huge problem. 

The food, however, was pretty terrible. I opted for one of their table d'hote options, which was a salad or soup and a main dish. I also thought it was supposed to come with dessert,  but I never was offered any, so perhaps not. I got their osso buco as my main dish, upon consulting the larger menu, which said it was a house specialty. It came with either penne in a red sauce or vegetables. The osso buco was in a super salty brown sauce, although the meat fell off the bone. The penne was cooked well, but the red sauce lacked any depth of flavor, even with cheese sprinkled on top. My husband got penne with sausage and broccolini in a butter cream sauce. He also said it was one dimensional and lacking in flavor. There was nothing interesting in any of the food we ate, and I was especially unimpressed with the \"house specialty\". I saw a waiter walk by with a pizza that looked good, but dang. Overall, we spent $65 including tip on a pretty awful meal."}
{"text":"I wanted something light, so I ordered the veal, no pasta. I regret it. I bet the pasta would have been better. My order was basic; just veal with gravy. Wasn't bad but I feel like they have better options to choose. I did enjoy the vegetables and potatoes though. 

My friends ordered mussels and they were really good. I don't know what one of them was but the mustard flavored mussels were tastier of the two. 

Ordered a chocolate cake for dessert. It was scrumptious and well worth the calories

Staff was more than excellent"}
{"text":"Corneli is located in the heart of little Italy and has been in business since 1960. We went on a Sunday night, there a few tables full. We quickly got seated, I asked the waitress what was popular there but she said everything is good and wasn't much help in my decision. So I went with a typical Italian dish, veal parmesan. I also got a mista salad as an appetizer. The salad was very good, the dressing was just enough and the lettuce was fresh. As for the main course, the veal was very thin and topped with too much cheese in my opinion. At first glance when my plate was brought It looked like it was thick but I realized it was all the cheese on top, that gave this illusion. It also was too spicy. The side pasta was not cooked enough. I have tasted al dente pasta but this was veryyyyy al dente.

As for the angus steak, it was very average. But the mashed potato was cold and not season at all. 

All in all the experience was very average."}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely fantastic. The food and service were great. The pizza was amazing and of course, great wine. Will definitely come back on my next tip to Montreal."}
{"text":"This place has it all. Amazing atmosphere, food, drinks and service! Very welcoming and kind waiters/waitresses. I was very pleased with the portions of the appetizers as well (calamari is to die for). The service was consistent and the waiters/waitress' made sure your water glass was never empty. I could stay here all night!!! I recommend the gnocchis and raspberry monitor sangria!"}
{"text":"Très bon service! La nourriture es bonne aussi. J'ai mangé le minestrone et une pizza et les deux plats ont été très bons. Le prix sont un peux chers mais pas beaucoup. J'ai le recommande!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. Great atmosphere. Really enjoyed the experience! Would definitely come back. Nicolas was a great waiter!!!"}
{"text":"Moyennement bon mais la table d'hôte du midi n'est pas trop chère. Menu typique italien sans trop de flalfla mais pas super."}
{"text":"Like how staff are very friendly here, not overly nice but the kind of casual and friendly. 
Food was good too. Ordered a seafood pasta and the amount of seafood they give is impressive. 
Came to this place as tourist and after reading positive reviews online. It's worth a compliment!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner Friday night. the service was excelent. Our waiter was friendly, and explained the menu perfectly. We ordered a salade, piZza and three cheese tortellini in rosé sauce. Everything tasted really good. The salade was perfectly garnished with just the right amount of dressing. My pizza was tasty with enough toppings. Sometimes you go to a fancy pizza place a and they barely put any toppings. Not this place, cheese, sausage, pepperoni, vegetables all where tasty and plentiful. The tortellini was perfect, i was scooping up that rose sauce.mmm"}
