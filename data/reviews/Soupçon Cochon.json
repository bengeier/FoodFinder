{"text":"Let me start this off by saying this place is amazing! All the food is bought fresh every Sunday by the owner and every week the menu is changed according to what was bought. The staff is very friendly and the food is incredible.   One of the more notable features of this restaurant is that they have a stock of beers, wines (if i remember correctly) and soft drinks that are produced only in Canada, with all natural ingredients and little to no added sugars.   The price is quite affordable for what you get and the menu is full of goodies, although I cant say exactly what the best options are as the menu changes every week, i can guarantee that the food is delicious and thoughtfully prepared."}
{"text":"Le Soupçon Cochon est un petit resto fort sympathique spécialisé dans les dîners. Le service y est excellent et très chaleureux. Personnellement, j'y mange de 3 à 5 fois par semaine (et je suis loin d'être le seul à m'y retrouver si souvent) et ne peux pourtant pas me blaser. Le menu est constamment modifié, chaque semaine 3 nouveaux sandwichs, 3 nouvelles soupes et 3 nouvelles salades nous sont proposés (les plus populaires reviennent au menu en alternance irrégulière, mais possiblement avec quelques variations). De plus, du lundi au jeudi, un succulent menu du jour nous est proposé. La cuisine des surs Pelletier est savoureuse, audacieuse et bien relevée. Si vous passé dans le coin et avez un petit creux, arrêtez-vous y, vous ne serez pas déçu! :)"}
{"text":"A great little soup and sandwich place.  And of course getting the combo with a bit of soup and a sandwich of the day is the only way to go!  Apparently the menu changes with what is good at the market, so hard to recommend something as it will probably be different when you go.  But this is a cool little place with a nice selection of craft beer and some cool ideas.  The ginger soup was perfect for a rainy day.  If the Ruben is available get that.  It was one of the better Ruben's I've had.  Nicely balanced and not too much of any ingredient. One thing I'm learning is spicy things are really toned down in Montreal compared to my taste.  For example the cucumber and wasabi soup really had very little wasabi heat at all.  But lots of warning about it being spicy when we ordered.  But encountered that sort of thing at other places during my time in Montreal.  Don't be afraid of the spice Montreal!  Walk up to the counter, place your oder and enjoy!"}
