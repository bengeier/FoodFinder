{"text":"I'll admit it; I am generally happy to see Edo as an option when I am on the road & need a quick meal. The veggie udon is acceptable fast food, although every location makes it a bit differently & I find I need to add hot sauce & soy sauce to improve the flavour.   This location is on the way home from work for my partner, so he picks up a quickie dinner here maybe once a month or so. The udon here is a decent version. Unfortunately they don't do their full menu here so you can't get sushi rolls.   It's a food court so you can usually find a seat if you don't want take out."}
{"text":"SO. SLOW!  I went here for sushi tonight and I ended up waiting 25 minutes.  So long, that I missed getting my husband's dinner at Opa next door. They have always been a not-very-fast food restaurant but this is just ridiculous."}
{"text":"The portions are much too small and it's too expensive for what you get.  You would need to order 2 orders of any item to be full.  So basically, you'd have to pay 20 dollars to feel like you ate a normal sized meal."}
{"text":"This specific locations owner's should head over to the one in Chinook Mall food court and see how they do it.  Because this one on 61St Ave gives you miniscule portions compared to the guys at Chinook  - I've been twice so far and its almost half the size of the usual chicken & beef, but the food is OK."}
{"text":"The owners take pride in this place. Food and service are consistently good. Best Edo ive been to."}
{"text":"Edo Japan in Aspen Glen Landing is a simple and modern restaurant. The employees are friendly and respectful, as well as patient and efficient. A beef yakisoba bento with California rolls and spring rolls only took a couple minutes to be made. The yakisoba itself was very yummy, however, the California rolls were lukewarm and the spring rolls were a bit cold. Furniture in the restaurant was in good quality and whenever there was a break in customers, employees would clean tables or mop the floor. Also, the washroom was clean and there was a steady supply of toilet paper/paper towels. Overall, Edo Japan in Aspen Glen Landing has appealing d√©cor and great employees, but when it comes to food items such as sushi rolls or spring rolls, one may want to think again.

{"text":"Just got to Calgary on our way to Banff and stopped here for a quick bite before heading out. This place is clean, service is good and food was delicious. We are vegetarians and had the noodle Bowl and sushi roll-both satisfying!"}
{"text":"The manager is shitty when there are no outlet to charge my phone so likely I would use the closest one but it's still over the wall. I do so and the manager rudely told me to take it out, i did say sorry but still gave me this dirty look. Besides that the meal is just any standard edo japan place. Never coming back again due to bad attitude from manager even thought I said sorry."}
{"text":"I like the renovations, much brighter! Always find it clean when eating in. And that sauce!"}
{"text":"Teriyaki Chicken, less rice more veggies - add Sirachi yourself (provided on the counter) - this is heaven."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday and two weeks previously.  Both were absolutely disgusting.  The first meal (Beef yakisoba) was so terrible I couldn't eat it (especially the 'beef'). The second meal I just ordered rice and vegetables hoping it would be less revolting. It was not.  A co-worker got sushi and it looked like it was made last week."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and we were looking for an alternative to the McDonalds or Subway fast food shops. Parents and kids alike loved this Edo!  We had the beef yakisoba, beef udon and chicken teriyaki. Delish."}
{"text":"Edo Japan is amazing in general. However I wish to boast about this particular location. The staff are amazingly friendly! Come here often enough and you feel like you've made friends with Jonny, the owner. I just wanted to give this location big kudos for being a great place to come too in the middle of the work day."}
{"text":"Edo Japan is a very common sight in Calgary.  (By the way, did you know that the first Edo Japan was started in the Southcentre Mall in Calgary?  That is so awesome!)  Whereas Asian food in many other ubran centres across the country is dominated by independent Chinese restaurants, Calgary has over 25 Edo Japan locations stem to stern, and even at the Calgary International Airport (YYC).  Whether you are in the north or the south, there is an Edo Japan near you!  The location here in Seton (near where I live in Auburn Bay) is one of the newer locations, and even though it is a newer location it does not disappoint!  Some may complain that the food at Edo takes too long to prepare to be considered fast food.  I disagree with the concept.  Edo makes fresh food fast.  Like for me, I am having my Bento Box and it is being made to order when I want it, not having it holding in a hopper or under a heat lamp long before I come in for my order for my sushi to get warm and stair-fry to get cold.  That's why the food tastes so good compared to other fast food joints.  The cashiers at this location take your order quickly and with no nonsense.  In less time than it takes to check the latest posts on Facebook on my Apple iPhone, my freshly prepared order is up and we are ready to go.  That's right, even though it's busy.  Rock on, Edo Japan!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, with the same food as you would get a food court.  This location is clean and efficient. My only beef with Edo, is the lack of beef lol. It's kinda sorta hit and miss as to how much beef or chicken you can end up with.  I've doubled the beef on a few occasions (Paid for it), and it seems you don't really get what you pay for. The have similar type of places that have opened in the past years like Teriyaki Experience etc that seem to give you a little more in comparison. I guess you know what to expect when you come here to eat. I'll come back whenever I get the craving again."}
{"text":"They actually serve you if you stayed in! Amazing experience and great edo food as always."}
{"text":"A little while back I had the most awkward date here. Lucky for me, Edo Japan made the date tolerable. Ouch. Was that too harsh?  Despite the painful company (I promise, I'm not a biatch...it just really was *that* awkward), the food was delish. I liked that it was healthy, fresh and reasonably priced.  I like this location because it's right downtown, it's spacious, and it doesn't get overwhelmingly busy (at least it wasn't when I was there).  While the company was gut-wrenching, the food was gut-pleasing.   One for two... not bad."}
{"text":"Ordered beef, shrimp teriyaki with noodles and I was served rice instead. My wife orders pho bowl with noodles with chicken and she got beef instead. That's two for two for a screwup in one sale. November 26, 2017. We picked up this meal between 6:31 You lost our business, hopefully Edo reprimands this cook/server."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick lunch to go. Yes, I am always on the go these days.   Ordered up some sushi as well as a beef yakisoba. The cashier was really friendly. Made sure to add some utensils, extra sauce and napkins in my bag without me even asking. Food was made quickly and all tasted delicious.   Ample parking. Great service and fresh fast food."}
{"text":"Took my little guy for an early dinner since we were headed to a movie.  The place was steady and not super busy. Ordered at the counter and had a really friendly girl take our order. Ordered a bento box, some sushi and a kids meal.  Sat down at a table and waited for our order to be called. A few minutes later,the sweet girl who took our order came over with a tray. Nice surprise. She also asked if it was okay to give my son a treat since he was so cute. Awe how nice. She provided him a lollipop and advised him,it was for after his dinner. He was over the moon. Lucky kid.  The sushi was fantastic and so was my bento box of noodles and beef. My son enjoyed his kids meal, a little ninja pack. Too cute.   They have two kids options called \"Little Ninja packs\". Includes small rice,beef or chicken and a juice box. Super cute and perfect for the finicky little people in your life.  The pricing is excellent, food is hot and fresh and service was amazing. Will be back."}
{"text":"Wow! I was completely shocked (in a good way) by the quality of the food and its taste. This \"to go with seating\" style establishment really delivered awesome flavor and value.  I ordered the Chicken Udon in broth, Gyoza and Edamame. It was brought to my table by a friendly waiter. I will definitely go back.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because the seating area lacks any ambiance. If I was rating the value, it would earn a solid 5."}
{"text":"Food was good but they always always sneak an extra charge on the receipt.  I asked if I removed veggies and mushrooms will you add more yakisoba like all edo's allow for free. She said yes Then she removed my veggies and mushrooms and charged an extra dollar for more yakisoba."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Staff here are super attentive regardless of how crazy busy things get. They will keep you informed on the status of your food. Quality of food is excellent here, too. I'm not typically a fast food person but this location I will always come back to."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 orders, two sumo chicken and beef, one with yakisoba noodles, the other with rice. The third order was a regular chicken, and beef with rice. I watched all the other orders get filled that came after we did. We finally got our order, and took it home. The yakisoba noodles in the sumo order were under cooked, and very chewy. The regular order of chicken and beef I had specifically asked for extra sauce, it was dry. The broccoli was more crunchy then cooked. Its like they rushed through our order because they forgot.... I would not go back to this location"}
{"text":"Clean little spot, not too busy, and we arrived 40 minutes before closing (9pm). We got service with a smile but a very rushed smile and an attitude of \"Give me your money please and thanks, here is your food, now get out!\" Maybe she had a hot date that night, who knows. We ordered, got our receipt number and went right next door to a really nice Starbucks until our food was ready (takes at least 10 min). We ordered the sizzling shrimp on rice and the chicken on rice, 2 spring rolls (to die for) and a 6 pack of spicy tuna rolls. All that, not bad for $24! My shrimp dish was so good, you get about a dozen in the dish and the steamed rice is always perfect. Hubby loved his chicken - I tried it. Very nicely done. I am usually not a huge fan of Spring rolls but I could have eaten 5 of them - so good! \"Tight\" spring rolls is how I describe them where when you bite them they are firm and everything stays inside. I hate the long stringy loaded rolls that smell fishy! Bleh! THESE here at Edo are great! Will come back here - but not for dine in, ever. Very fast-foody feel to this place but I feel strongly that for a quick grab and go meal this is wayyyy healthier than say - Wendy's?I love Wendy's but hubby is addicted to hamburgers almost to the point of an Intervention so I am trying top wean him onto some nice, well prepared, steamed food and this fits the bill, right! Someone please send me a message if this place is proven NOT healthy! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Its the sauce - everybody loves that damn sauce.  This particular Edo is a well run sit down version of the food court ones you find. They appear to have a fuller menu with  sushi, bento boxes in addition to the \"classics\" most people order teriyaki chicken and beef. Being a vegetarian, I order the grilled vegetables. They aren't grilled so much as fried alongside with everything else, but still they are doused in that delicious sauce that keeps me coming back. The veggies offer up more of the broccoli and mushrooms etc than you would get in your meat based dish - The day I posted this pic, the owner was in and I seemed to get a much nicer looking meal than I have had in the past..hmmm.... oh well I wasnt complaining.  They have fountain drinks which are nice - so you can get free refills. The restaurant is always nice and clean and the food is predictable and tasty and the price point is reasonable for what you are getting and a more satisfying feed than a typical fast food meal.  The staff here are efficient, and its got plenty of parking - as well as a pokestop just outside the front door - if you are into that.  All in all, its a nice option and good value. I have a feeling that Edo will continue to do well for a long time."}
{"text":"First off let me say it looks the same as every other EDO but that's not a bad thing \"it's a fast food place\".  The staff here go out of there way to make you happy.  I always love the food and that of course hasn't changed either!  Great work seton EDO I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"* YOU CAN'T ALWAYS BE PERFECT!*  Just to start off I am a HUGE Edo Japan fan!  However this location lacks spark, their staff were tired and annoyed that I walked into the place to order something.... uh it's your job, stop complaining!  I had a craving for Salmon rolls and because Blowfish is closed I walked an extra 3 blocks to Edo for cheap Sushi and high expectations. The waiting time was 5 minutes (quick) but sloppy. The seaweed was peeling away while I was eating and the rice you could say was mushy and slightly undercooked.  But I was so hungry I at the entire thing. Would I come back for more? Probably not, however their Chicken Teriaki with Extra Mushrooms & Shrimp is to die for."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience ever at EDO. I ordered a veggie noodle bowl, and I ended up getting a bowl of just noodles. When I requested for additional veggies, the man refused. This place is stingy and over priced. Stay away from this place, unless you want to pay $11 for a bowl of JUST NOODLES and receive rude customer service."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to go to for Chicken Teriyaki! Of course if you are there between the hours of 12-1:30PM during the lunch rush you will come across very big lines of business men and women trying to get their lunch as quickly as possible. I have tried both the chicken and beef Teriyaki however I always opt for the Chicken Teriyaki as it is quite a big portion and I find the chicken to be flavorful. The team their is usually quick with getting the line up through as they prep chicken and beef before hand to make things easier.   If you are at this food court, I recommend trying out Edo Japan as they recently closed the one at the Scotia bank Plaza food court (I loved them) and the next closest one I believe is at the harbourfront center. It's too bad they don't have more locations around the area."}
{"text":"Pretty bad chicken teriyaki from this place in the North Hill Center food court. Looked good as they were cooking it in front of you but the tiny thin chicken pieces slopped with some lame chicken teriyaki sauce and wimpy vegetables did not do me right.  I've had so much better at other Japanese places at different food courts around the U.S.   Bottom line: Gives Japanese food a bad name."}
{"text":"I couldn't manage to eat the food, the sushi was not fresh and their egg roll tasted like cinnamon."}
{"text":"pros: clean, friendly staff, good atmosphere.  cons: small portions compared to similar type of fast food restaurants of this type."}
{"text":"service is great food is always fresh cooked mkt mucn else to say a average fast food joint"}
{"text":"Standard Edo experience here. As with the other restaurants in this food court, it gets quite busy at lunch. Everything is made to order and is fresh off the grill."}
{"text":"Wow - what a big disappointment for take-out food.  It was close to closing time when we came in - there were three staff on and one other customer.  I ordered Beef Yakisoba and my wife ordered Chicken Teriyaki.  When we opened up out take-out bag at home - there was a giant puddle of sticky sauce at the bottom and the containers were a hot mess.  My dish was swimming in Teriyaki sauce and had chicken instead of beef.  My wife's dish had barely any chicken and was also drowning in sauce.  So I might have given this mess of a meal two stars but the sauce was very bland and not very thick and also not very favorable."}
{"text":"Perhaps the cooked dishes are better, but we got sushi and it was possibly the worst quality sushi I've ever had. Tuna, salmon, scallops - all of it awful."}
{"text":"Review 19 of Yelp`s 30 Day Challenge 2012  This is probably the second place my husband and I visited when we first got here back in February. We did not know a lot of food places then so we just picked a place that wasnt packed, wasnt pricey and served food we were familiar with. We also wanted something quick as we were so tired from a day for viewing rental properties.   Since Edo is pretty much the same in all its locations, I`m just going to focus on those who work here. The people here are amazing. Not only are they quick at getting orders and serving food but they were also extremely helpful. Most of them are Filipinos and when they found out that we just moved to Calgary they offered us tips in finding an apartment, a job, opening bank accounts, etc. They immediately made us feel welcome in a very unfamiliar place. Compared to other locations, I find that this branch does not overcook their plates nor undercook them. They also do not give me a weird look when I ask for 4 scoops of their teriyaki sauce. They were so accommodating that we ended up eating there 6 out of 10 days that we stayed at Citadel. We went back a few days ago and find that the same people still work here and they still provide the same great service and experience we had a few months ago."}
{"text":"Edo is absolutely delicious. Made fresh to order every time. I've eaten many times and never had a bad experience. The service is great the staff all at once greet you the second you open the front door and as your walking out. They also come around to ask if the food is good if it's not overly busy and they are always cleaning the tables !"}
{"text":"Love going to Edo Japan my favourite is the bento box with the teriyaki chicken but instead of dumplings extra California rolls. YUMMM !"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy going here and now it has gone downhill.  The creamy scallop I got was tiny in comparison to before, the rice in the California rolls was dry and they didn't give me any sauce for my tempura."}
{"text":"The usual you would expect from the Edo chain. In a good way.  Consistent quality and fast service."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites franchises.. I like almost everything I have tried there!!..  I have had all kind of beef dishes and they are all good!!.. also, the sushi is not bad to be a franchise... and the service is really good...  I think I will keep going there everytime I have to eat in the area, because in my opinion is probably the best option around.. or at least, is the best I know until now..."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, really crappy shopping centre to navigate through. Somewhere in the middle of this maze you'll find Edo and you'll enjoy your 15 minutes there. Too bad it will take you twice as long to figure out how to get out of here."}
{"text":"Was in town for work and tried this place out as it was close to my hotel. It's a \"fast food,\" type of place but I was impressed. The service was fast and friendly and the food was good. It's also very reasonably priced. If you're close to the seton area definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"You'll find good food a nice interior and great staff at this location. Everything is cooked to order and the staff greet you everytime you arrive. Nice fast food experience."}
{"text":"I went to the franchise Edo Japan located inside sunridge mall in calgary, NE.  The cashier was male Asian race.  As he was serving another customer infront of me, he was asking me what I want to order.  I think if you are serving a customer, you have to give them 100% service.  He was so rude to the customer infront of me.  When it was my turn, I asked for spoon, and answered me with LOTS of attitude, I then said, \" you dont have to be rude!\". I couldnt understand what he answered back. The cook however saw what happened and apologized for his co-worker's behaviour and was nice to me.  This is why I gave it 3 stars.  If it wasnt for the cook, this franchise is NOT getting any stars from me, so watch out for that grumpy guy!"}
