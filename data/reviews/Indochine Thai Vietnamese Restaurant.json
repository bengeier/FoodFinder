{"text":"This place is completely revolting. Don't go. I feel bad saying this because they have really nice service but EVERYTHING, from the soup to the noodles to the tasteless chicken to the overcooked rice is just horrible. Blech."}
{"text":"This place is quite lovely.  The food was good -- not disgustingly salty or greasy like some Asian food joints -- and it's priced reasonably.  I left satisfied and would probably visit it again.  The staff is also really friendly, and the place is attractive and clean."}
{"text":"Indochine is a fine place for a quick Asian fix at lunch in the Bloor/Yonge neighborhood. They have a good selection of lunch specials, which include soup and a vermicelli/pad thai type of entree, usually with $1+ for a spring roll. I have always enjoyed the food there.
The service is only so-so, as they are usually quite busy and can't keep up. The servers themselves are very nice, so that makes up for it. I would not recommend going if you need a fast lunch, but otherwise Indochine is pretty good."}
