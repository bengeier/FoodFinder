{"text":"Love this place, the food is excellent, so much better than the Tempe location. I also like the chill atmosphere much better than it's predecessor. Friendly staff, good drink specials, can't go wrong with their pizzas or appetizers. Porco pizza is life"}
{"text":"Well first time there. Wife and I went art walk and then saw La Bocca, peaked in and said let's give it a try. Our greeter couldn't have mustered up a smile if her life depended on it. The atmosphere was interesting, large bar but a bit noisy. A common complaint of mine...maybe I'm getting old but I do not understand why music needs to be a part of so many eating establishments.  I digress. Our waiter was friendly and attentive...solid. we ordered a cheese plate to share as an appetizer. It was large with 3 fairly small cheese wedges and the rest was bread and crackers. Both the bread/crackers and the cheese were very good however. At $14 for way to much bread and crackers and to little cheese...i don't think so. We them split a garden pizza. It was tastey but a little to much crust for my taste. I think La Bocca has great potential but changes need to be made before I would go back. Poor management?"}
{"text":"We went to La Bocca for the first time on 11/5. Terrible front door hostesses. We're almost completely ignored. We decided to go elsewhere I'm giving it one star because I can't give zero."}
{"text":"We ordered bruschetta and truffle fries for apps and a pizza and veggie pasta entree (w/ chicken added) for our meals. The pasta came with salad- I got the Caesar. The bruschetta bread was very thick which kinda drowned out the toppings. It was just ok. The Caesar salad was good though it was a little too heavy on the anchovy taste for my husband. They didn't offer any black pepper for it. We never got the fries! They said \"they didn't prep enough that morning\"?! What? The veggie pasta was just ok- nothing to write home about. If they could figure out how to improve on their sauce it would be an excellent dish.  My husbands pizza was on the cusp of being horrible.  They serve it on a wood board which caused the crust underneath to get totally wet and soggy. The rest of the crust was not done enough...a little bit longer in the oven and it would have been crispy and good. The salami and black olives did not go together at all! And the salami had a musky taste to it.  Finally the drinks are soooo expensive. At least have a cheap beer alternative - the cheapest beer was $6. And the wine was $10/11 and up per glass. If your gonna charge drink prices like that- you had better be serving excellent food! I don't think we'll be back- and on top of that- it makes us not even want to bother trying their Mexican side :(

They should start tasting their own food- maybe they'll realize they have some work to do."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my friend today and it was awesome. Tiffany greeted and served us and we enjoyed every minute. We received great recommendations. I couldn't decide between a salad or bruschetta. Tiffany explained her personal favorites and after determining what I like with some questions, she  her recommended the beet salad and offered the bruschetta a la carte, which was perfect to get just the amount I wanted. I looooove that beet salad, with beautiful heirloom tomatoes and beets, along with candied nuts that provide a great balance of fresh, sweet, and savory. Also, I loved that Huss brewery was on tap, offering coffee kolsch. Great visit! Happy to see La Bocca in Chandler along with a favorite server!"}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in with another couple for drinks.  The service was slow but not terrible.  When I got the check I found that I was charged for my bourbon on the rocks ($9.) and another $3. charge for \"rocks\".  My wife had a scotch and water ($12) and there was another $3. charge for \"rocks\".  I know we are having a drought but really $3. per drink for ice!  What's next, a rental fee for the glass?  This was a preliminary stop to check the place out before going there for dinner.  That won't happen now!"}
{"text":"Except for the calamari appetizer (quite OK), the main dishes were definitely below mediocre:
my wife's mushroom pizza had only 3 very thin slices of the smallest champignlons we've ever seen, everything covered generously with spinach leaves... It took two requests to obtain some more mushrooms, and the servers didn't seem to be pleased. One couldn't taste no lemon(or find any capers) in the sauce of my mussels limone, or any garlic in the garlic bread! We asked for more lemon wedges (we got them) and garlic, but the garlic we got was toasted, not fresh, hence no more taste whatsoever! The jazz combo (bass & guitar) seem to be competing in mediocrity with the food ! Ultimately we got a small discount and an apology for the inconvenience, but the evening was wasted anyway. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, you're better off going to another location. Not sure what's going on at the chandler location but they need help. I ordered a pizza, I was given bread with pepperoni and burnt sausage on it. They didn't even put cheese on the pizza. When I arrived the staff was hanging around in the back nobody even up near the bar. The person in the kitchen needs to switch jobs and management needs a stronger presence at this location for business professionalism assistance."}
{"text":"Fabulous service, ambience and food. Went for dinner on Saturday night and was initially disappointed that the chicken dish I wanted was out but the vegetarian pesto pasta made up for it. As did the bruschetta, tiramisu and gelato trio! Great food! Prices, especially for happy hour were pretty decent considering the portions and taste. I will definitely visit again. Oh, also, our server Stephen was a sweet guy who took great care of us. Thanks, Stephen!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place the benefit of the doubt by giving it three stars. Our experience doesn't warrant that rating. I've always loved the la Bocca in Tempe so hopefully this place will get up to that level soon. Just some quick bullets:
*service very slow
* wouldn't allow me to make a reservation because they said they were booked up. But when we showed up the place was empty and remained empty throughout our visit.
* food is just not very exciting. Pizza was extremely greasy.
* staff was friendly and drink selections were good. 

Hopefully they just need to work out some kinks. It's only been open a few weeks. So maybe give it a couple months before you try it out."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Thursday date night special.  Fun live music and service that wasn't t over the top but attentive and apologetic when we had to wait. Really good food and wine!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Been there twice and loved it all. Atmosphere, service, food presentation and special service. We wanted to check out Modern Margarita next door but my grandson wanted their cookie in a pan, so James our waiter offered to send it over for him. Thanks James above and beyond!!!"}
{"text":"Disgusting. Calzone inside was cold. The dough was undercooked and soft   
Never go to this place
Bad food bad service"}
{"text":"Very cool spot for drinks and small plates but food is moderate at best. Lots of competition in downtown Chandler so hope they step the game up a bit.  That being said this is more a reflection of what is around than bad anything at la bocca, recommend."}
{"text":"Last minute on Mother's Day when our previous brunch plan was a disaster we celebrated at La Bocca.  Amazing service and food. Shout out to Drew who got us in. Much appreciated.  We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Went last night for happy hour. Did not have to wait too long. The chicken Caesar and beet salads were fantastic. Also had a margarita pizza which was also great.  The service was attentive and the food and drinks were delivered timely.  I would highly recommend this new wine bar in chandler."}
{"text":"Very good Margarite pizza and Calzone selection. The heirloom tomato and beet salad was a delicate blend of flavors with the balsamic vinagarette. Get the dressing \"on the side\". Very nice property, decor, ambience and great location. Gotta say...way nicer than \"Crust\" across the street. Quieter, better service and selection."}
{"text":"I was so, so excited to go to La Bocca when it opened in downtown Chandler. On Friday night, I went and...

...the good: the d√©cor is sleek, with plenty of seating and areas to have cocktails with a group of friends. Nice outdoor seating options, too. The drinks were between $7 - $15. I ordered a sangria and enjoyed it. The bartender was attentive and I got my drink quickly.

...the bad: I also ordered a pizza. It was more or less uncooked.  Soggy crust and raw toppings kind of uncooked.

La Bocca seems like a decent place to get a drink. However, with the number of options in downtown Chandler that have not only drinks, but good food as well, they're going to need to either lower their prices or up their game."}
{"text":"I love the food, it's delicious, albeit a  bit pricey, especially if you chose to create your own pizza. But you can't beat the sangria! One of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Handmade cocktails and some pretty fantastic bruschetta. Our bartender Alex was friendly and knowledgeable. Pretty chill atmosphere allowing for easy conversation. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I was going to go 3-stars instead of being an asshole and going 2-stars, but really this place is about a 2.5 no matter which way you go, and then I remembered I paid $12 for some of the shittiest bruschetta out there.

I realize downtown Chandler is trying to up its appeal as a chic place for 30-somethings to happy hour and hang out, so I understand that the prices are going to be higher than a dive bar.  But the prices are out of line with what they're serving.  $9 cocktails made by a standard bartender with not much expertise (our bartender and her manager or something got into a squabble over what should be in a drink) aren't exactly a value-add on a menu bereft of drinking options outside of happy hour.

This place is a beer and wine lounge primarily, with food that leans towards shareables and finger foods, though they do have entrees.  But La Bocca doesn't do anything particularly well, just insanely, completely mediocre - it's the Star Trek: Into Darkness of downtown Chandler bars.

Their pizza is kind of weird, it's like a thicker and not-well-executed neopolitan pizza.  Not a great value for the price, either.  You'd think for $13-16 you'd expect either a big pizza or a great pizza, but instead you get neither - a small-ish pizza that's floppy, undercooked, and oversauced or wet for some reason.  Just poor execution.

The bruschetta is outclassed in every way by Postino's, who also has a much better happy hour FYI (go to one of those instead if you want bruschetta).  Even the bread - lacking a semblance of toasting, being cut waaaay too big, not stand out in any way - faltered.  And it's bruschetta, there isn't much to it beyond the freaking bread.  The toppings were haphazardly tossed on each bread monolith.  That brie with marmalade was terrible, by the way-  is that shitty jarred marmalade?  Understand that usually when baked brie is topped with marmalade, there's a lot more brie to balance out how sweet that shit is, dear god I don't need the beetus!  The Spanish, with the manchego and olives wasn't terrible, though I don't know if that's in comparison to how bad the other one was.  The other two were so forgettable that I can't even remember what they were.  But for $12 for 4 pieces of blah bread and some wack toppings, it's again just not worth it.

I don't know if we just had 2 bad experiences that happened to perfectly sync up to one another, or if this is just how La Bocca is, but really...it's just kind of not worth it unless everywhere else in downtown chandler is busy and you need a drink.

Maybe if the prices came down a tad and they fixed their food quality.  If that happened, this could be a decent little joint, but for now, your money is better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"When I entered La Bocca for Thursday night happy hour and it was nearly empty, I knew its 3 star rating wasn't a fluke. I normally wouldn't choose to try a place with such average reviews, but my friends wanted to try something in Chandler.

I got there first thinking I would need time to snag a table, but that was unnecessary. I made an executive decision for our group of 3 to go with the date night menu since it seemed like the best deal. The date night special is a bruschetta, board, pizza and dessert plus a bottle of wine. I was excited about the Seghesio Arneis (a white) initially until I saw they were serving a vintage that was a little past its prime.

The bruschetta was cut into halves instead of fourths like Postino which we prefer for sharing. The Spanish with manchego and olives was decent, but the brie and marmalade was downright disgusting. The menu touts the marmalade as homemade. What kind of sadist is sending out something so bitter? Blech! The pizza was ok. Not as big as I hoped, and the toppings (garlic and tomatoes) sounded delicious but all tasted pretty average. We got a brownie for dessert, and it was definitely from a mix. Not a good mix either. Go for the Ghiradhelli's at least! The mint chip gelato was even worse. I could taste all the artificial flavors and color.

While the date night special was a good deal, I'd happily pay double the price for food that I enjoyed."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the bottle and pizza night (only $20!) Which is every Monday/Tuesday. We loved our chicken bacon pesto pizza and our bottle of Zin! Delicious homemade pesto! Great service! We'll definitely back!"}
{"text":"I. Love. This. Place. I'm so glad they're in Chandler now. I used to hate going to the Tempe location because of traffic. Now, I can enjoy this place in Chandler. I ordered a sangria here and it was refreshing and delicious. My friend and I started with the bruschetta and they were all delicious. The Spanish and pesto one were my fave. We then shared a pizza and the crust was delicious. I know, I know, I judge a pizza based on its crust. We went there for my friend's birthday and apparently you get a free dessert for a birthday. SCORE! So, we got the brownie pazooki and that was bomb.com. This place is seriously so good and I'll be coming back fo sho."}
{"text":"Love! Staff is amazing! Always so welcoming and helpful. Food is tasty and price point is appropriate. Great happy hour specials and the ambiance is perfect for any occasion. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went in a Sunday with our family of 4. A large party was seated at the same time. There were no other guests so it was surprising on how long it took for someone to take our order. Food was below average.  Service was too."}
{"text":"Went with a crowd, was planned ahead. Several people ordered calzones. They were served burnt. Pizza was over cooked. Chicken was under cooked. Meals took way to long to come out. Deserts took 25 minutes. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Sloooooow service. Went there on a Thursday and it wasn't crowded.  Food below average. Ordered a salad with salmon and got chicken instead. I don't eat chicken. Not a pleasant experience. Will not be back."}
{"text":"An amazing experience that stands out from the rest of downtown Chandler. Very contemporary and mellow.  The food was amazing. I especially enjoyed the mussels and the chicken ceaser salad. They have a very friendly staff that took great care of my girlfriend and I.  Malcom and Akala were our bartenders and they were superb. La Bocca is a must try. I know I'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"Beautiful space, terrible service. We sat down at the bar around 10pm and the place was pretty empty with no bartender in sight. Once he finally came back to work I ordered the vino cocktail by recommendation from the bartender. It was so sweet I couldn't even drink it. It tasted like a watermelon jolly rancher. It's pretty simple to incorporate fresh ingredients into your cocktails but this one used Monin syrup. Ick! The bartender went MIA again and never asked how our drinks were. Apparently he was more concerned with smoke breaks than serving his customers. It's also worth mentioning that the tequila bar next door was so loud and distracting we couldn't carry on a conversation. Not a relaxing ambiance we had hoped for to end our night. Needless to say, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went to La Bocca for lunch and a couple beers. We got the med platter and two sandwiches. The food was ok, not great. The Sierra Nevada kelleweiss was good, but the menu says $6 a beer and we were charged $7 per beer. We eat out a lot and tip well so there's no reason for an establishment to charge more than menu price. I don't like feeling taken advantage of because I'm in a trendy part of town. We won't be back to La Bocca."}
{"text":"We tried La Boca with some friends. We ordered the calamari to start, it was a little small for the price point I think. The entree round came next and the food was absolutely delicious!!! My recommendation is the truffle pizza (I added some meat to it). Also it's worth the extra $2 to split a salad because you pretty much get two salads and they are delicious! I think they were understaffed that night because our waiter brought us cold coffee and the waiter/food took forever, but the manager came in and comped some of our meal due to the long wait time. The manager is what will bring us back (and the food.. It really is great). They're new and I appreciate they called people in to accommodate being a little understaffed. Overall it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the service was incredible! Our server (wish I could remember his name) was on top of it, checked in with us regularly, and met all our needs! 

The alcohol was perfect as we expected. I got the pineapple daiquiri. Even though it was strong it was still smooth. My mom orders an apperol spritz every where we go and they were able to accommodate her.

After those positive I have to bring up the negatives. First off our where we were placed for seating was disappointing. We walked past open booths through out the restaurant before they placed us in an uncomfortable booth back next to the kitchen. It was behind an odd partition and made the dining experience not all that it could have been. 

We are regular patrons of La Bocca Tempe and absolutely love the food there. La Bocca Chandler food however was very poor. Everything over all lacked flavor and seasoning. My favorite pizza is the porco and it was nothing like the one I get in Tempe. We were very disappointed in our food and would not come back because of this. 

If you are looking for some where to grab drinks and a small appetizer (bruschetta plank). This place is great but don't plan on dining here for a full meal. Also make sure they seat you in a decent spot."}
{"text":"Went here w a large party. They set us in the back by the kitchen. While this was ok as we were separated from the restaurant it's by the kitchen. Meh. The food was very weak. The chicken as dry as a bone. You know the kind you sit and chew and then drink a glass of water to get down. The rice was worse than boxed rice. The bartender was rude. We asked for a shot of fireball, excuse me it's not top shelf , he says \"fireball not here bud\" and kind of puts his nose in the air. Lol a 25 year old that is an alcohol snob bartender. I get it haha. We won't be back. Mainly due to the pricing of the food and the quality. Ther are always going to be rude and condescending people out there. But food weak. No thanks."}
{"text":"Called in to order a tiramisu and creme br√ªl√©e (hey, we've had a rough week). Quick and efficient service, nice atmosphere..the main downside was, unfortunately, the dessert. Both desserts tasted like pure sugar out of some Betty Crocker box, actually whatever the generic brand of Betty Crocker is...tiramisu was topped with a Hershey's-like chocolate sauce and whipped cream, and the creme br√ªl√©e was actually a mix between bad flan and custard.

I'm definitely not tempted to come back. Bummer since we dine in downtown Chandler at least once a week. We'll stick to Vintage- a few hundred feet away, the Living Room- just a few miles away, or Postino's- in Downtown Gilbert, if we're feeling like Italian & wine."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks are ok. The atmosphere is really nice. I got the pizza, and the bruschetta platter which was delicious! Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"1st time there. Only their 3rd day open. The food was great. Sangria-- YUM! Nice atmosphere; cool decor.  A few hiccups but attribute that to their 3rd day, nothing they won't work out. Friendly staff. Overall, a nice experience. Note: they share a kitchen w/the new Modern Margarita bar next door. While the two places look distinctively different, the signage/front door markers were clearly confusing to people. We saw repetition w/ confused customers thinking they were at the Modern Margarita bar & wondering why the margarita choices were limited. Personally I thought it wasn't hard to figure out the two different entrances, but it happened so often it should be something they address w/better signage. Out of curiosity, we checked out their Modern Margarita bar-- looks fun! Will try that next time. La Bocca-- thumbs up!"}
{"text":"New to Chandler. I have gone to this restaurant for years on Mill Avenue, but have discovered it on Arizona Av in Chandler. I love this place. Had a great lunch recently with all kinds of goodies. Great Bloody Mary, too. Please eat the delicious pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"Pluses: The atmosphere was great, the music was cool and the fish bowl margarita did its job. 

Minuses: They were grossly understaffed on a Saturday, the tacos were super dry and the food just wasn't good. They're definitely overpriced for what you get, especially when you have to wait a while before getting service. 

I won't come again, but at least the margarita made me happy."}
{"text":"While there were some opening week jitters, overall the experience was quite enjoyable. Was going to have a beer, but the draft selections were limited due to \"keg issues\" so opted for a glass of a Malbec instead. I zeroed in on the turkey and saut√©ed mushrooms sandwich but didn't remember to make a side request - saw the table next to us got fries and they looked great so I flagged down our server, Lisa, to ask what side I would get by default - it was not going to be the fries, so I quickly requested that change - and boy howdy am I glad that I did - the fries were perfect, quite literally among the best I have ever had. The sandwich was exemplary as well, each element contributing to the overall taste. Will definitely keep this place on the docket for future meals."}
{"text":"Should have known there was something wrong when the place was nearly empty on a Friday night. 
Food was good but they were out of a lot of things on the menu. 

The worst was when they added an extra bottle of wine to our bill. We caught the error and they quickly fixed.

Too many other choices in downtown Chandler to have this kind of experience."}
{"text":"Happy Hour for vinophiles!!  Mostly Californian Reds, but some decent values especially with the $5 discount for HH. Cheese plate was OK. Needed a sweet component better than dried cranberries. Solid cheeses. Although I didn't order them the Bruschetta or the Mediterranean Plate were great (from bar mates) -  they looked great and big for sharing for $8 (HH). Great bar service. Super cool, calming atmosphere. Will come here again, no doubt."}
{"text":"Malcom made my family's experience here great. He offered some great cocktail recommendations and was able to answer all of my questions regarding the food. We felt like we were his only table, with the level of service he was able to give us, though we could see that we weren't. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good for wine, pizza or brushetta. Frequent the bar often and it is enjoyable.  However, tonight we thought we would try the entrees.  Very small portions and very bland.  We had salmon and the chicken dish.  The size was similar to a tapas plate with no seasoning.  We are not big eaters and we both left hungry.  Very disappointed in their entrees."}
{"text":"Home of the smallest glass of wine in the world. Add some really bad service-- one and done.  Go somewhere else in downtown Chandler"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The atmosphere is great, and the decor is really cool! The food was yummy, too! There are quite a few menu items that can be shared, so I'd recommend going here with a group. I ordered the bruschetta board, my mom ordered a pizza, and our friend ordered a salad. We all loved the food, and the pizza and bruschetta board were perfect to share between the 3 of us. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Party of 9 last night.  Nice welcoming male host, female hostess with resting B **** face, sat 20 after our reservation. No problem with that.  Server very attentive.  My biggest complaint was food was really lackluster.  Brushettas served on soft bread. Bland tomatoes, under seasoned.  Pizzas ok. Glad they use Shreiners sausages because that was the only flavorful thing on it.  Of the 5 pizzas we ordered 3 were undercooked.  Despite asking to re-fire one it still came out lightly toasted.  Not impressed with seasonal salad. I'd skip this place. Sorry."}
{"text":"I really want to give this a great review as it's right near my office but I've been three times and the experience keeps getting worse and worse. Molly and I went in a few weeks ago for happy hour and ordered a cheese plate, meatballs and some wine. There were only two other tables in the entire restaurant. We waited 30 minutes for our meatballs and finally asked the server who went and grabbed them for us. However, they were ice cold so we returned them to have them made again. We waited another 30 minutes with nothing being delivered. I finally just told them to forget about it. The waiter felt bad so she gave me a taste of one of their expensive wines which was awesome. 

La Bocca has one of the best wine lists in the area - too bad they can't get their food and service together."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time on a Monday for Happy Hour. We sat at the bar and the \"bartender\" wasn't professional at all. And he was talking really loud in a restaurant with 4 tables, so pretty uncomfortable. We ordered Bruschetta's and garlic fries with spicy ketchup. The fries were good but the Bruschetta.. The pieces of bread were really thick but not a lot of products on it and flavor. They were all cold, the bread wasn't even toasted. The only good thing was the happy hour on the wine, $5 off on the glass of wine."}
{"text":"Are you looking for a slick lounge with $12 drinks and $7 beers but due to your probation restrictions you can't go west of Arizona Ave to the well established Brickyard or Ostrich?  If so, I present you La Bocca!  

Let's call this what it is...it's a lounge.  It's well decorated and has plenty of comfortable seating to enjoy a drink as well as a decent patio.  I will not consider this a restaurant because then I'd have to take away another star.  The pizza, and I'm using that word loosely here, was as disappointing as it gets.  I looked at my wife during dinner and seriously said \"I think I'd rather have Domino's.\"  I was expecting her to give me the ole' \"you're being ridiculous\" look but instead she asked \"is it the raw garlic, raw tomatoes, or the wet crust?\"  It was all of those things.  The roasted garlic pizza had raw garlic.  Not roasted garlic that was then undercooked along with the dough...raw and crunchy.  They opened a clove of elephant garlic, cut it in strips and threw it on the pizza.  I do not think \"roasted garlic\" means what you think it means.  

I don't know what the issue is with Chandler and pizza but it just isn't working downtown."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for lunch one Sunday. When we showed up, there were only like two other parties in the entire restaurant. We started off with the calmari appetizer and it was bland and served with an \"aioli.\" which was just plain mayonnaise that was was really thick. We were very hungry and could not even finish the calamari. It took about forty minutes to get our pizza, which was shocking since they were not busy at all. The server did not introduce himself and was not very hospitable or inviting. I ordered a pizza that was supposed to have arugula on my pizza. They were out of arugula and asked if I would like spinach instead so I opted for that.  When my pizza came out, there was way too much spinach and it was  slimy and wilted so I took all of it off. I have had better pizza at a lower price. This place is way overpriced for the quality of food and lousy service. To top it all off, the server messed up our bill and charged us a dollar more for the beer. The menu said the beer was five dollars and they charged us six dollars. We had the server correct it and gave him our card. He ended up not running the card and gave us someone else's bill. My husband had to walk over to the bar to let him know. We will definitly not be coming back here as we frequent San Tan Brewery and prefer that. We miss when this place used to be Coach and Willies! The only thing we liked about this place was the ambiance."}
{"text":"Very mixed experience.

Nice location in downtown Chandler. The salad, pizza, and tiramisu were all good. 

And then there were the constant struggles. Overly loud live music to the point of it hurting our ears, the overly priced beverages for mediocre quality, the misters dripping water onto our table, the 30min wait to get our wine, and the $2 charge to split a salad without being told about it. This place needs to work on some things."}
{"text":"Great spot in old town Chandler serving wine, beer and wood-fire oven pizza. My wife and I visited on a Saturday evening for dinner and didn't have to wait. Although the place is a little on the small side they make great use of the space. The interior is wood/metal rustic with edison bulbs hanging from the ceiling and exposed beam ceilings. It works. 

Our server was friendly and helpful with the menu. There's a great cocktail selection with some fantastic looking concoctions- also a healthy wine selection and a handful of draught beers. Wife ordered a sav blanc that she loved, I stuck with Stella. The menu is simple and not overwhelming. There are some tasty looking apps (happy hour 3-6:30p daily), a few salads, several pasta dishes and then a large selection of pizzas. I had a sausage & basil pie and it was delicious. The crust is light and tasty- the red sauce is excellent. It's a good sized portion, I wasn't able to finish it all. 

There was live music while we ate- making it a little difficult to carry a conversation. The lighting is pretty dark but that's fine with me. After 2 drinks each and 2 pizzas we dropped $75 with tip so it's a little on the pricey side. The sav blanc was $10 a glass and the pours were painfully small. But overall, great food with a nice atmosphere. This can be put on the \"special occasions\" list and I'm sure we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Servers are very accommodating and courteous! We were served a different bruscetta than we ordered and before we noticed our server brought out an additional plate of what we originally ordered. 
They have a great date night deal which we love! And the food is delicious (this coming from a wife of a big Italian family!) Must try the tiramisu!"}
{"text":"Got together with a girl friend for drinks and decided to try La Bocca.  There was one table of about 6 and us.  Service was horrible.  What you pay even at Happy Hour is not a value.   First and last time there.   Decor was nice , decent wine list just not service oriented :("}
{"text":"We went to the Tempe location and had a good experience so we thought we'd give this Chandler location a try since it is closer to home.  We walked in and told the host we would like a table for 2 but he stopped us and asked if we would like to see the menu before he sat us. Somewhat awkward since he wouldn't seat us until we looked at the menu. We pretended to look at the menu and then told him we were ready. He sat us and our waiter took 15 minutes to greet us to take our drink orders.  Took another 15 minutes to come back to take our orders. Keep in mind that this was 9pm at night and there were only a few tables there in the whole restaurant.  Food came out pretty quickly, but once the food got dropped off, our waiter never came back to check on us until we requested our bill. Food was just as good as the Tempe location but the service here could use some improvement."}
{"text":"Last friday I was at 55Chicago for a Girls Night event that ended fairly early. So a friend and I decided to wander down Chandler and see if we could find something else to do. We stumbled upon La Bocca. So we decided to get something small to eat and a couple drinks. The place was pretty empty. It was about 10 pm. The atmosphere was still fun - I love the decor and the fun music they were playing. My friend and I decided to hangout at the bar where we met bartenders Todd and Malcolm. They were immediately joking around with us. They were very helpful and gave honest advice on the menu which was really appreciative. I ordered a Limoncello (which Todd warned me would be strong and it was..I didn't finish it). I don't remember the name of the drink my friend had. Looked like blueberries were in it. Whatever it was it was good. We ordered fries and bruschetta and those were good.
I can definitely say I'll be back. I'm happy to see this new addition in downtown Chandler. I've already started telling people to check them out."}

I love the one in Tempe. I frequent it often. This one is new and by my house. I've been three times now. The last time, yesterday, was disappointing. Service was painfully slow. They made mistakes on more then two of our party's checks. Food was just ok, manager was nice but surprised that he didn't notice how long everything took. Place wasn't busy either. I love La Bocca but don't foresee myself going back anytime soon. A shame really. I had high hopes.

Update - June 2017
My review was originally 3 stars. I've given this place 5 more chances since that time last year and every time they disappoint. I work across the street and this place is super convenient for our team. Well, today we had a table of 15, and were the ONLY patrons in the restaurant. They kept us there almost 2 hours and really ruined our order and the experience. They handed out old menus with old pricing, we ordered and then were charged more for every single item. I was charged extra for horseradish for a sandwich that said it came with it but didn't so I asked for it. This was the french dip sandwich. The waitress didn't tell me it was extra and I thought that was in really poor taste. I said something and when I did I noticed I was charged $2 more for my sandwich. Once I said something people looked at their receipts and they too had been charged more. We complained, and the waitress said that they were old menus and the prices had gone up because minimum wage went up. I didn't think that was professional AT ALL, and how about you don't make an obvious error such as not updating your menus with the correct pricing. It left a terrible taste in everyone's mouth. We also, after 3 times of asking for 2 boxes, could not get 2 boxes. We were all late returning to the office and will likely not return. I'm not really sure how this place stays in business. I've been there in a group and I've been there just with another person or two, and the outcome is always the same. It's also worth mentioning that right when I walked in and we had the group the guy working wanted to know how many people we had, I said 10 or 15, and he snapped \"well which one is it?\" Dude, chill, why don't you count us as we are walking in. Seriously so rude!"}
{"text":"Decided to try it after seeing it several times while in Downtown Chandler. Server was friendly and the drinks, salad was very good. One problem was the Salmon was overdone and you would think they would deduct one of the glasses of wine or free desert or something? Comfy booth but the table height was too low. Maybe go for appetizers or desert next time."}
{"text":"Went here after happy hour at modern margarita. Loved the pizza and wine selection was awesome. Todd and Bryce very attentive. Loved the ambiance. Very comfortable yet classy. Love it!"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY. 
Only tables available we're all dirty had to wait 10mins to clean one table off.
Next order 4 drinks took nearly 30mins.
Ordered garlic fries for app and 3 dinner entree's that took 55mins!
And garlic fries came out 10mins after the mains.
Pizza was ordered with no olives, was dropped off with olives. Was told by server, \"Sorry the kitchen is a mess right now\".
And to top it off, about 2 hours later got sick from the Bocca Trio....for hours."}
{"text":"We came in on a random Saturday at about 2 pm. Very quiet, as expected. We ordered the Bruschetta plank. Great choice... so many yummy options. Derek behind the bar, mixed up some amazing cocktails. Our only complaint was the music selection... so sleepy.  I know it's a wine bar and a bit more mellow, but it put us to sleep. 

Yummy food. Great drinks."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit to La Bocca. The first time we went, it was a Thursday and we were unsure if we just sat down or waited for a host. After standing there for about 2 minutes, I saw a server at a kiosk and I walked up to him and said excuse me, \"do you have the couples special tonight?\" To which he handed me a menu over his shoulder without even turning around to look at us. I was apalled by this behavior but another server came out and she smiled at us and said we could sit anywhere. The food that time was very good and if not for that waitress, we would have walked out. 

Now, for our most recent visit, we made a reservation for 12 people. The waitress was very sweet and gave us great customer service. Here is where this restaurant is severely lacking. It took over 20 minutes to get our drinks and even longer to get our appetizers out. We had to be sitting there for at least 30 to 35 minutes. 

On my end of the table, we ordered mussels and calamari. The calamari was taking especially long to come out and when we asked about it, the server apologized ans sais they accidentally overcooked it but were making us a fresh batch. She still brought the overcooked app out but it was completely unedible. I was also very disappointed with my $13 mussel appetizer as several mussels were completely sealed shut.

I ordered the tagliatelle with prosciutto for dinner and that was very good. They seemed to do well with the main entrees but not so good with the appetizers and length of time in getting our drinks and food out. 

The server was extremely apologetic as I don't feel it was her fault but more so the kitchen. 
Two people in our party also ordered the red sangria but said it tastes awful. Several of,us took sips and also agreed it tasted like cleaner. Lol Not sure what they use but it wasn't good at all.

They gave us complimentary desserts for the while table to try and that was very nice. We appreciated it.

I will most likely try this restaurant at least one more time but if we continue to have spotty experiences, we'll probably just give up altogether."}
{"text":"We just returned home from our meal at your restaurant in Chandler and I must say I am completely disappointed.

I get that you don't have your A Team working on a Monday night, but there were several tables in there along with three couples eating and drinking at the bar.  One server a bartender and three other guys were handling all the serving of food and clearing/bussing tables etc.  

Some of our friends had beaten us there as we were running a little late, so they had already started on appetizers and drinks.  We arrived and were asked quite quickly if we wanted drinks, so we placed that order and perused the menu.  

I ordered the Chopped salad and calamari, my wife had the Pasta Bolognese and our daughter ordered pasta with alfredo sauce...this is where the decent service stopped.  I look back at the photos we took right before we left, and see the appetizer plates still left on the table, along with most everyone's dinner plates.  I think back to the waiter serving my calamari and dumping it all over the table...our waiting a minimum of 10 minutes for our second round of drinks and then wondering where he was when everyone was completely dry at the end of the meal, typically where a waiter would do an upsell of dessert or after dinner drinks, but he didn't show.  

On to the food...the calamari...the pieces that were cooked properly were actually alright, but that was only half of the order.  My salad had a total of 5 blue cheese crumbles and the equivalent of a half slice of bacon chopped up and tossed in with the flavorless dressing.  The lettuce was chopped up so small that it may have well been shredded.  The whole thing was flavorless to the point I was adding dried chili pepper, cheese, salt, pepper...basically anything that would add any flavor.   The alfredo sauce was half and half cream mixed with some parmesan or asiago, and that was it.  If I were at Geno's pizza, I would have expected the same, but we were at some new exciting eclectic Italian place sitting amongst restaurants like the Brickyard and Vintage 95, so the 'authentic sauce' should be at least better than my 7 year old daughter can put together...even she knows about the balance of cream, butter and garlic and might even think to add some white wine into the blend if she was really trying to impress.  Ok...I get it, that was the meal for the kid (the one that eats sushi, pho and bulgogi on the regular...the one that enjoys her brussel sprouts with a side of pan seared pancetta)...so onto the other adult meal...the bolognese.  By definition, this should have been an amazing mixture of finely chopped onions, carrots, beef and pork, blended with an appropriate amount of fresh tomatoes, garlic and other spices so as to not have us believe it was from a can, however what we got would actually have tasted better had it started with a base of Prego.  It came out absolutely dry.  Additionally, for the price, it should probably be more than the 4-6 ounces of pasta that she received, although if it actually had any sort of palatable flavor, that might have been enough...it certainly was not compensated by the dry and flavorless bread.

Luckily some other folks at the table had wisely chosen the pizza, which as far as I could tell, they enjoyed very much.

Please, for the sake of those that enjoy flavorful food, change your sign to say Hot Pizza and stop attempting to create dishes your staff has no business serving.

Perhaps pass this onto your chef at the Chandler location...it looks like it has good reviews.

{"text":"Wow.. so genuinely impressed with the Chandler La Bocca staff. Coming from the restaurant industry and knowing how rare it is to see a team that is working together toward one common goal - It was so incredibly refreshing to see the teamwork and comradery I experienced here tonight. There is nothing that makes me want to spend money more than a hard working staff that keeps a smile on their face even in the lines of fire and clearly swamped. Not to mention the TO DIE FOR bruschetta plate (I don't know if Seattle can compete!) and craft cocktails that made it hard to sign my bill (Thank you Derek).. Thank you La Bocca for making a first timer to AZ a regular for life (might move here to stay true to my word)... I will be back as long as the live music from Tony P is still here and the blonde server with the braid and amazing work ethic is still here. #LaBoccaLifestyle #Impressed"}
{"text":"Stopped in to have a quick Drink and Appetizer. (actually trying to goto Modern Margarita, but went into wrong door) ... 

Very Clean restaurant, and awesome decor. Staff very friendly and great suggestions on the available dishes, etc.. 

KiltLifter on Tap . yum.
We went with the Bruschetta Plank / Pick 4.
Smoked Prosciutto _ A+
Salami _ A
Mozzarella _ C
Gorgonzola _ D
Ok, we read through the selections and picked 4, but will be back to try 4 more different ones.. The Smoked Prosciutto was top notch, delicious n flavorful. The Salami was pretty great and loved the Pesto they use.... Mozzarella was ehh about mediocre , but Thinking about a Steak Gorgonzola with the awesome Gorgonzola gravy/sauce, we tried the Gorgonzola , and let me tell you, this stuff is very pungent when all on its lonesome. The pear slice and balsamic helped kill it down, but it was still a little overpowering and couldn't finish.. 

Without taking away on my interpretation of Gorgonzola, as this would definitely have to be done per preference knowing its flavor.. my bad... 

STAFF and Decor, atmosphere make this a very relaxing stop when in Downtown Chandler.. 

100% will be back... (I'm not the greatest wine guy, so I don't throw my wine opinions out there.. I stick to Cabernet Sauvignon when needed)"}
{"text":"Came here for a date night and happy hour.   Place was pretty empty but quickly filled.  Had the Med Plate for appetizer. Pizza for main and gelato for desert.  
Drinks are fantastic and if you are Lucy you will have Todd as the bartender.    Great service and personality.  Definitely will be back.  Great addition to downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"Great wine bar, lots of wine options to choose from with a wide range of prices for every budget. 
Went there for Happy Hour, $5 off any glass of wine, it makes killer deals for some selections, as cheap as $5 per glass.
Appetizer prices at great to, 4/ bruschetta for $8 or 2/$4, cheese boards, olives and other great choices for $8.
The service was excellent too, our waiter was always tentative and asking us about our experience."}
{"text":"Heard about this place and seen it since opening.  Perfect location in downtown right next to everything.  The setup up walking in is nice and once inside the place has awesome chandeliers and a nice wine fridge to look at entering.  

Got seated and attended to right away.  Lucky we showed up at happy hour and the prices were excellent. 

The bruchetta is phenomenal and we also ordered a few pizzas which were really good.  

We will be coming back to this place to enjoy it more."}
{"text":"I just stopped in La Bocca  Urban Kitchen Wed night there was five of us ...Great friendly fast service , the food was great, and the entertainment made it a perfect evening ...We will be back and I will tell all my friends ...Cheers Bluesman Mike"}
{"text":"I usually do not give restaurants this rating, but was not at all happy with our experience.  Hubby and I arrived at about 4:45-5pm on Sat (8/28) and it was not busy, there were a couple of tables that had people and apprx 6 people at the bar with 2 bartenders. We were on a date and decided to check out one of the new restaurants in downtown Chandler and the reviews were good at the other locations.  Literally, we sat at the bar and it took 5 minutes before either of the bartenders even acknowledged us or looked our way.  There was no way you could miss us, we were sitting in the middle of the bar and the bartenders kept going back and forth, talking, doing things, doing everything else except at least saying \" I'll be right with you\".  It was amazing watching this because there were only 6 other people sitting at the bar.    We were finally acknowedged and given a wine menu and that was it.  The bartender walked away and I think literally forgot we were there.  Nothing said about the wine, food, etc. No waters no nothing.  A younger gal came and sat next to us and immediately she was taken care of with her drink order.  Once we saw that we decided that it was time to go, and the experience was certainly not worth staying for.  We had friends that were eating dinner in the booth behind us and unfortunately told them we were not staying and why we weren't staying.  The hostess at the front, super nice, and mortified that we were leaving tried to accomodate us, but unfortunately we really were really disappointed and just decided to go elsewhere.  
I know this is a new opening but the staff needs to be better trained.  There are too many good places out there and not sure if we will be back to give this a second try."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed, the wait staff here is slow and I am not sure why. It's busy but it's also a small place and not busting at the seams. We sat waiting for service until I went and asked for a waiter, then we had empty glasses and had to ask multiple people for napkins and silverware. The food was soooo good. If I was only giving stars for food they would have gotten a full 5. 
 We got appetizers and didn't need anything else it was very filling."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Our waitress was amazing and food was good. Advice, don't  sit in the back corner the light is waaaayyy too bright and takes away from the ambiance"}
{"text":"Good tasting and quality food but service is very slow during lunch hour. Always a 40+ minute wait until the food is out to the table.

Update to 1 star. Ordered salmon before and it came out raw. Ordered a salmon salad to go and they forgot the salmon!!"}
{"text":"Yuck! This place has totally gone down hill! They obviously are trying to cut corners and have totally changed the original pizza recipe and boy can you taste the difference. This sucks because we really loved it when we use to go down to the one on mill Julian used to own.  If they can go back to the original way I think it might help turn this business around and I would definitely be a return customer! I can tell according to the other reviews that others are feeling the same. The table next to us had the most boring looking bruschetta I've ever seen that didn't look the least bit appetizing. Our antipasta board which we loved at the original spot didn't even compare. Tasted old and expired and even seemed like the server knew that. Pizza is better at Peter Piper (which is certainly not a plug for peter piper)! Bring the old La Bocca back!!!"}
{"text":"These guys always treat us right. Monday and Tuesday special of $20 pizza and bottle of wine is a killer deal. The pizza is great and the wine selection is decent"}
{"text":"Went for lunch during the week just to try it out.  The ambience is cool, a little urban chic, but comfortable.  The wine prices per glass are on the higher end but not out of line for a nice selection   The bruschetta was good.  We tried the Ricotta cheese and honey, so good highly recommend.   We also ordered the roasted beet and the Mozzarella bruschetta, both were good.   We ordered a calzone and a 1 topping pizza. Sauce was good not great, needs more garlic and basil.  But the toppings were fresh and flavorful.  The only real complaint would be that the crust was a little underdone, which I find is a common problem in the valley.  Ask to have it cooked a bit longer and it was good.  
All and all a nice addition to downtown Chandler"}
