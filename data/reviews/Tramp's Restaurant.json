{"text":"I came to Pittsburgh for a trade show. I stumbled upon tramps just across the river and stopped here four nights in in a row it was always a pleasure pretty much a dive bar but the bartenders were great. Each night they had a very cheap menu item such as Wings Burgers and Tacos. I will definitely come back if I'm in Pittsburgh again! Shout out to the two barmaids,  Bria and Erica!"}
{"text":"Nightmare!! Steer clear. We were over charged 4 extra beers?? Sketchy and management sided with the bartender didn't believe us meanwhile they have cameras in the bar. Rude and ugly on the inside and out that goes for looks and personality. Should have stayed at village tavern better service and much friendlier adults not children."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to visit Tramps a few weekends ago after remebering my dad's rave reviews of the bar and their wings. Tramps is a diamond in the rough. I mean there's not much ambience and absolutely no view but it just works. 

Once inside, we were greeted by the bartender who was super nice. There were several patrons at the bar enjoying the game. It was a friendly crowd and I felt uber comfy here. 

The menu has a nice selection of offerings that I cannot speak on because I just haven't tried them...yet. After looking over the menu, we decided to go with the garlic butter and spicy bbq wings. They have a few TVs in the place which are all in areas that ensure you can see regardless of where you sit. After only minutes our wings arrived. They bring them in baskets with paper boats for the bones. I couldn't wait so I took my first bite (my tongue healed from the burn...LOL) and it was wing love at first bite. Omg! These are what you want every wing to be!!! Crispy, fresh and seasoned just right. The bbq was sweet and not overly spicy. I could taste some nice smoke from the sauce. Yum! The garlic butter was more mild but, once again, just right. I've been thinking about them since I left. Mmmm (Yes, I'm talking about wings!) Wow...why did it take me so long to come here??? 

Lastly, this place was very clean which isn't the case in a lot of divy type places around the Burgh. Needless to say, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Weird in 2015 you can still smoke in a bar..!?
Gross if you don't smoke, if you smoke you'll probably love it!
Bartender was not overly friendly but hot'!!!! :)
Got lost and ended up here, kind of an odd area/location."}
{"text":"Good place to relax and have a beer"}
{"text":"Cigarette smoke is way too heavy in here. I would like to support this local business more often but the smoke reminds me of a steel mill."}
{"text":"I suppose if you are a regular, it's okay.  If not a regular, good luck with getting attention for drinks or something to eat.  I ate at Tramps years ago when the Highmark Data Center was located on Greentree Road, and it was okay back then.  Decided to go back and enjoy a cold one and a sandwich, but it apparently has gone downhill since the earlier days.  The two female bartenders seemed to be preoccupied the entire time, and I finally ended up leaving out of impatience.  Never again."}
