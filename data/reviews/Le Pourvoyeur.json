{"text":"Ambiance agréable, un peu bruyant pour une bonne conversation, mais un endroit intéressant particulièrement pour déguster votre Gin préféré ou faire des découvertes."}
{"text":"On a été à cet endroit pour le brunch et franchement c'est très ordinaire et dispendieux.  Pour une bière et l'ambiance, non pour le manger."}
{"text":"If that wasn't already enough food, we also split an order of pogos. These weren't your ordinary, corn dog pogos. Battered then rolled in panko, the all beef sausages snapped and popped when you bit into them. This is definitely not your frozen supermarket stuff - not that I would expect it to be."}
{"text":"I must say I was pretty disapointed.  Shitty beers on tap at $7 a pint isn't what I'm looking for in a pub.  I guess its more a restaurant than a bar."}
{"text":"Le menú du soir est plutôt limité, mais par contre l'ambiance est bonne et les serveurs sont sympathiques. Je n'ai jamais pu essayer le menu du midi qui est plus élaboré, et la seule fois que j'y suis allée déjeuner mon plat était correcte."}
{"text":"The menu presents the concept of doing a few things well rather than having many ordinary items.
Nice presentation. Prompt lunch service with friendly (but not overbearing) staff member. Prices are fair. 
I would go again."}
{"text":"This review is for their NYE party, not the food.

I was not looking forward to going out because places like these overcharge just because it's NYE and they can. I stood in line and grudgingly gave them my $20, and they handed me two tickets. Figured one was for admission, but then my friends told me that it was for a shot and a beer! Woot!!! It just pretty much paid itself off, and from there I was ready to ring in the new year~~~

Got upstairs and they even had coat check. Music was bumpin and I danced so hard my calves and arms were sore the next day. Way to burn the poutine I'd eaten all trip long. When a friend went out for a ciggie, the bouncers even gave us blankets to wrap ourselves in. THAT is NYE service. 

Loved it! Had a blast! Sophie, thanks for choosing this place :)"}
{"text":"Plus j'y vais, pire c'est!

Cet endroit est idéal pour prendre un verre un soir de semaine. Les vendredis et samedis sont désagréables: la musique est trop forte et la place est bondée. 
Le service est sympathique, mais, pauvres serveurs, ils ne fournissent pas : pas assez de personnel pour la quantité de clients (ex.: Nous avons dû attendre 35 minutes avant de pouvoir simplement obtenir des menus.).

Côté bouffe, c'est décevant... Les portions sont minuscules (le fish and chips = 3 minuscules morceaux de poisson pané aussi gros que des fish sticks congelés) et la qualité des plats n'est pas au rendez-vous considérant le prix. Le seul plat qui était bien était la poutine. Par contre, à ma dernière visite, j'avais 42 grains de poivre non broyés (je les ai comptés!) dans ma sauce à poutine.... 

Habitant le quartier, c'est un endroit que j'aimerais aimer, qui a du potentiel, mais j'ai été trop souvent déçue, malgré les nombreuses chances que je lui ai données... 

Je n'y retournerai plus...."}
{"text":"Très bonne ambiance, service extrêmement sympa, de bons déjeuners , curieusement l'une des meilleures Poutine en ville, belle terrasse arrière en été qui donne directement sur le marché Jean-Talon. Une excellente addition au quartier."}
{"text":"We sat on the sunny terrace at the back overlooking Jean Talon. The ambiance was very chill, servers were very nice and bilingual and attentive. I'm not a fan of straight gin but they had a nice selection of gin cocktails. Food (salmon tartare) was well balanced and presented. I probably shouldn't have gotten the vinegar dressing side salad in addition to the Tom Collins - that definitely dulled my taste buds a bit."}
{"text":"Rien d'exceptionnel vraiment, deuxième fois que j'y vais en peu de temps et le service n'est pas  hot. La bouffe est ordinaire. Le vin et les bières aussi."}
{"text":"Très bien situé (directement sur le marché Jean-Talon), la bouffe est très bonne (sans être incroyable non plus) et c'est aussi un très bon endroit pour prendre un verre entre amis.

L'ambiance est agréable et puisqu'il s'agit des même propriétaires, on remarque tout de suite l'air de famille avec le miss villeray

À essayer!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to ruin a Saturday night. Unfortunately I've been in this place twice. 

-It's famous as a Gin place, but they don't serve Martini! 
-The beer selection is poor, expensive and mediocre (if you like Stella and Heineken you might disagree). I ordered a pint of \"a fin du monde\" on tap and the beer was spoiled in lines.
-They have a dance place upstairs and the D.J. know how not to play good music.
-They have some one whose job is to walk around and ask people where to put their stuff. The second time I was there he almost annoyed everyone in the second floor."}
{"text":"Late night dinner at Le Pourvoyeur on a busy Wednesday night with a friend.
We had been sitting for quite a while until a waiter showed up with the menu (which we had had since we had sat down). We ordered a pitcher of beer (22$) and a fish and chips. 
The fish was fresh and the fries were fine but for 14$ I was expecting more food on my plate.

Would definitely come back as the location is golden!"}
{"text":"Well situated in the Jean-Talon Market, it's a nice place to go for a beer, but also to eat a good, and tasty meal.

It was not my first experience at Le Pourvoyeur, but I went there for breakfast this morning with the Yelp Poutine Committee. Yes, you read it right, they had a breakfast poutine. As weird as it sounds, it was very good. It's basically everything you usually have in a regular breakfast: potatoes, cheese, bacon, sausages, gravy, and.... an egg.

The venue is great with a good covered patio in the back, giving you a view on the market itself, but at the same time, it makes it, in the summer, a bit noisy. I went there two times, and the service has always been good. Notice also that because of the market, it's hard to find a good parking near the restaurant, and the traffic is usually dense during the weekend.

Still a good place to go before doing some grocery shopping at the market."}
{"text":"Sympathique, mais je n'y ai pas trouvé que ce soit LA place à laquelle se rendre absolument! Si vous voulez tester une poutine matinale, déguster d'autres brunchs, siroter un café, vous pouvez vous y rendre, mais rien d'exceptionnel à cela."}
{"text":"Just popped in on a Sunday morning and there were still some places available on the terrace. I had a very good fish and chips. The haddock had a crispy batter with a  slight trace of curry seasoning . The potion size was perfect for a brunch .The  coleslaw was really good too,however it was served in a single use plastic container."}
{"text":"Good mood, nighttime there is only a small menu. I took the fish and ship and it was very good. So if you want to have a beer (they have a decent choice, but they don't do their own beer), and have a little snack  it's good !  

From what i heard their poutine is excellent ( will try it soon !). The staff is doing a good job to keep the mood at a good level !


Bon petit pub, pas beaucoup de choix de menu le soir. J'ai pris le fish and ship et j'ai trouvé ça excellent ! 

Donc si vous voulez prendre un petit  snack avec une bonne bière c'est un bon endroit à visiter. Le personnel aide le pub à avoir une bonne ambiance. Il semble que la poutine aussi est très bonne ( je vais l'essayer  bientôt !)."}
{"text":"The poutine is delicious! The cheese curds are big, tasty and fresh, and the portion size is  reasonable for a medium eater like me. They make veggie burgers as well. The variety of drinks and alcool is also a bonus. It's a cozy low key place with interesting people in it."}
{"text":"Food is excellent! I had a Salmon Tartare, well prepared and nicely served.
Their cocktails, out o Gin, it is a Gin Bar, are also really nice. 
I had a Pim,s and Gin cocktail, I'm into it from now!
The place is a pub with DJs, so not the best place to enjoy food and a nice talk for a date or a good chat."}

\"Fun friends drinking gin
Pourvoyeur Karaoke
Yes Hallelujah\"

I never heard of Le Pourvoyeur until one of the Elites mentioned he was a regular here for Karaoking. So a bunch of us decided to check it out. We made reservations for 7:30 pm Since Karaoke starts at 8 pm. We were seated on the main floor and grabbed a couple of drinks before heading up to the second floor for karaoke. I had the Botanist for 10$- I know nothing about gin being a whiskey drinker but it was neat to see this place has such a wide variety of Gin all over the world. Kind of like the Burgundy Lion of Gin! Since the bars were different -we had to close our tabs downstairs before heading upstairs.

There was a beautiful terrasse on the second floor that was too chilly for a September night. We were the only group upstairs. We were super happy to find 5$ food and drink specials for Karaoke Wednesday including 5$ appetizers (poutine- was decent sized but nothing exception, breaded chicken wings, mini pogos, nachos -tad dry but not complaints,etc) and 5$ gin & tonic (totally worth every dollar as they were generous with pouring the gin to tonic ratio!) We were getting impatient as the DJ, or the old sound system tech walked in past 9:30 pm. We had to type out our song selections since he couldn't hear us. They had 2 TV screens, a proction screen and 2 mics setup. Once the songs started rolling we had an awesome time. You could literally request any song- Thong Song-Sisqo, No Scrubs-TLC, Fill me in-Craig David, MIlk Shake- Kelis, Aladdin's a whole new world were some of my fave selections!! 

I wish the Karaoke started on time- unless I would've been able to stay longer on a work night.
Only disadvantage. But  great setup. Thanks Jon for the suggestion for the UYE!"}
{"text":"Best mini pogos, EVER? I think so. I'm definitely coming back both for the food AND drinks. I'm not normally a cocktail drinker, but I enjoyed many of their great concoctions. The beers looked delicious and perfectly chilled, sadly I didn't have the time to try any! The bartenders here are super cool, laid back, funny, friendly, and just great to deal with all in all. Great service is key, and Le Pourvoyeur exercises that!

I wish it wasn't so far from where I live, but I will definitely be making a return."}
{"text":"Pour une amatrice de bières, le choix est mince. Des bières commerciales un peu raffinées et c'est tout. L'endroit sent plutôt mauvais et la dernière fois que j'y suis allée, la table était terriblement collante. Il n'y a pratiquement pas de lumière dans les toilettes et l'odeur ne nous met pas en confiance. Le menu est restreint et la nourriture généralement grasse. Seul l'emplacement fait que cet endroit est fréquentable mais marchez un peu et cherchez un peu et vous trouverez mieux pour prendre l'apéro."}
{"text":"This place rocks for many reasons: central location, $5 menu upstairs and Karaoke.

I met up with some other yelpers and we threw down the gin & tonics and had a blast rocking out to Destiny's Child, Eminem and GNR.

The place itself is not too packed on a Wednesday night and the first floor is not loud.

The Gin menu is many pages long and I recommend making them a double.

Oddly enough the $5 special was the strongest drink of the bunch.

Food was standard bar fare (nachos, pogos, chicken bites, poutine) but at $5 bucks it was well worth it.

Superb service as well. Keep it up"}
{"text":"Avoid the brunch.

Service was extremely slow, though we arrived on a Sunday at 11:30 and the place was far from packed. My grilled cheese was nothing to write home about. My coffee was below average.

Sad truth is everything looks and tastes better at your run-of-the-mill Cora :("}
{"text":"Ceux qui aiment le gin vont être comblé. Ils ont plusieurs choix. Demander au serveur de vous aider sur votre choix. Le service est bien. Le bar aussi. Beau petit bar de quartier :)."}
{"text":"Bel amiance et juste à côté du Marché Jean Talon.  Si il fait chaud et qu'on a envie d'un petit cocktail au gin ou une bonne bière en fut c'est parfait. Après on peut continuer notre magasinage. On a par contre pas mangé mais on a vu passer des beaux casseaux de frites maison."}
{"text":"First time trying public Karaoke! 
This place has a DJ (if you want to call him that) and so you just tell him the song you want to sing and he puts it on the list. You present yourself to the mic when it starts. 

It's cheaper than a private room and if you get there early enough, you have it all to yourself so it's almost like a private room.

The karaoke is on the second floor and it's quite spacious and comes with lots of 5$ deals (all entrees and basic calamari, as well as a 5$ gin and tonic loaded with gin so definitely worth the price). 
They open the second floor at 8pm and the guy comes in at 8:30pm to start playing songs.   

Once more people show up, it does drag on a bit because there are more songs to go through before it's your turn. Also, if you're shy there's a bigger audience.

Loved my time here so much! They had great deals, the food was delicious (much better than you'd expect, I ordered the fried chicken and pogo's), and the service was fast.

I'd go back with friends in a heartbeat! 

Visited on 27th of September 2017 for an UYE"}
{"text":"Stopped by here to get a drink before eating out. The place was loud, very loud. Loud from people shouting at the big screens (not sure, something with men on ice skates!), loud from birthday parties all over the place, and loud from the loud music playing. 
It's mainly a gin bar, so don't expect anything exciting about their beer menu, but their gin and gin cocktails menu is attractive. We tried the one with the Quebec gin (Ungava) and maple syrup and even though I'm not much into gin, I really liked it (but then put maple syrup into anything and I will love it!)
It's a bit on the expensive side - 20$ for a beer and a cocktail (I will never, and I mean never, get around to having to add taxes and tips everywhere here!) - but the service was great. The waitress was obviously running between those big parties tables flagging here at every chance but still managed to take care of us in due time.
Glad I went as we've been meaning to try it since the day we moved in the area though :-)"}
{"text":"Le Pourvoyeur est un bar à Gin avec une terrasse sur le marché Jean-Talon. Mon expérience avec le Gin est relativement récente et j'aime découvrir les différentes variations de cette concoction de plantes diverse. Les variations sont multiples et Le Pourvoyeur en a une bonne carte qui contient des importations privé. C'est vers cette option que je me suis tournée puisque ce sont des variété plus difficile à trouver que celle qui se retrouve à la SAQ.

Nous étions pendants la période du \"5 @ 7\" mais malheureusement, pas de spéciaux sur les Gin, les promotions étant réservés a la bière. Dommage, cela ferais de moi une cliente plus régulière puisque c'est un excellent endroit pour prendre l'apéro avant un repas dans mon resto vietnamien favori qui est tout près!"}
{"text":"Gin, something about having this makes me think, why haven't I started earlier... what am I missing. Well, Le Pourvoyeur can help... with there millions of selections of gin (not exactly) but the variations are remarkable. I've been here before but I've never been here during a 5 a 7 period. The place looks more vibrant and alive with the terrace in the front and the open concept in the front of the bar.

I tried a gin I haven't tried before for England called Boodles and it was actually really good. 8.5$ a glass is a normal price for a gin and the prices vary from 7$- 12$

This spot also has good food. I had the bacon poutine, which filled me up for more gin, and I can say that it was good!

I recommend this bar if you're looking for something a bit different and/or to celebrate a birthday. I have to mention that they have an upstairs with a DJ so that the party can run until the AM.

Location is kind of hard if you come by car (only if you come for 5 a 7) after 8 you're fine!

 

Hope you like it!

 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"\"We're here for brunch, do you speak English?\"
\"I speak English but I don't take baby.\"  (gesturing to baby with couple behind us)   

We were seated in a sunny atrium overlooking Jean-Talon Marché and the beautiful people of Montréal.

BRILLIANT.  Wasn't our baby.  Popped in for brunch here with a girlfriend.  I had the Oeufs Bénédictine (Eggs Benedict) and my friend Amy ordered La Poutine Matin (breakfast poutine), but, really, we shared.

So the Oeufs Bénédictine were delicious.  Perhaps some of the best Hollandaise sauce I've ever had and there was this unexpected this slice of sharp cheddar under the ham.   The potatoes is was served with was divine.  Perhaps on the fruit salad was a bit disappointing.

The poutine was also quite exceptional.  The gravy was lovely and I'd imagine that means the regular poutine is lovely as well.  This one, instead of fried, has the roasted potatoes served with lunch, a poached egg, a bunch of tiny sausages and a piece of bacon in with the gravy and the cheese curds.   Divine.  The gravy could have been hotter because the curds never got melty but it was too delicious to matter.

The coffee here was also very good.

Despite the delicious food and charming atmosphere, where Le Pourvoyeur really excels was service.  We never wanted for refills on coffee or water.  We were left alone when we wished to linger and whisked away when we wished to leave.  And, when I was having trouble reaching a local Yelper/friend about meeting for coffee because my stupid American phone and my friend's stupid American phone both lacked service, our server stepped up and leant us her personal phone to reach him.   This was unexpected and we were grateful.

Le Pourvoyeur is a top notch establishment across the board.  (And they take credit cards!)"}
{"text":"Had a blast here last night!

I like the vibe of this bar on the first floor for a drink and a bite but glad we moved it up to the second floor, where the karaoke night took place. 

There weren't many ppl which was fantastic as it meant our group got to sing all of our song requests in rapid succession instead of the usual 20 song wait like at other places. 

The specials they had were awesome: $5 poutine, $5 nachos, $5 gin&tonics... etc. Fast service and very fun times karaoke-ing!"}
{"text":"C'est ma 3e visite au Pourvoyeur et je ne suis jamais déçue. J'adore le décor un peu brut et la luminosité dans la section arrière. Excellent choix de gins! Une belle offre quand même pour les gens qui voudraient boire autres chose. Plusieurs cocktails spécialisés également comme le Ungava pomme, sucre et rond en bouche. Un vrai délice avec le brunch.
Le menu n'offre pas une tonne de choix, mais c'est parce qu'ils n'utilisent que des produits frais. Un peu plus de roulement pour le menu de base serait apprécié. Les prix sont raisonnables, surtout en fonction de la qualité de la nourriture. J'ai adoré le \"sloppy Joe\" déjeuner, un plat que je n'ai jamais retrouvé ailleurs. 
Je ne suis jamais venue le soir, juste pour le brunch/lunch, mais je recommande cet endroit pour tous les amateurs de produits frais et d'alcools fins."}
{"text":"Nourriture dispendieuse pour ce que c'est, mais pas mauvais. Excellente sélection de gin avec un menu très descriptif (ce qui aide toujours)!"}
{"text":"Fun little bar in a cool and improving neighborhood. I always seem to go on quiet nights but I recommend you try it out. Two floors of drinking heaven await. Stay away from the cucumber GT. the waiter lied to me, it's not good, at all."}
{"text":"J'aime bien ce petit bar a tendance plateau, surtout car c'est a cote de chez moi et sur mon chemin. L'alcool est cher, mais bon tu payes pour la place a cote du marche jean-talon. Les mercredis c'est lady's night...par contre attention c'est bruyant! 

Coté nourriture, c'est assez bon. De la poutine au canard confit a la salade de betterave et feta, mium! Des minis pogos et grilled cheese avec une bière c'est parfait. 

Aucune idee pour les repas principaux..."}
{"text":"This is a great place for carpaccio, and by that I mean deer carpaccio.  I've never had.  They also have bison tartare.  The deer carpaccio is truly fantastic.  I'm giving 4 stars for originality.  Also, you can walk next door to the market and buy meats, cheeses, maple...deer sausage, whatever you want."}
{"text":"Wonderful addition to the Jean Talon Market neighbourhood! This 'Pub Festif' has a ground-level covered patio on the north side of the market, and a second floor with wide open windows overlooking the sprawling vegetable stalls and nearby church spires. The interior is simple and lovely. The staff are bilingual and super friendly. The fries and poutine are tasty, and the pints of beer are most welcome. The rest of the food is a little underwhelming - maybe the presence of all that surrounding local goodness made me set my hopes too high, but I would love to be able to go to this pub and see new items on the menu featuring seasonal goodies and shoutouts to the farms and craftspeople being featured."}
{"text":"My friend and I were supposed to go work in a café for some school project. It was 9pm, the Habs game was playing so we decided we would go elsewhere. We went to Le Pourvoyeur on the spot and we loved it!

My friend got a Gin Tonic and the presentation - Yes, presentation. On a Gin Tonic - Was very cool. The drink was also tasty and great.

My plate was yuuuum! I got the Porc Smoked Meat sandwich and I would say it was very, very good! The price was a little iffy, at 20$ for a plate with fries and a Coke, but I am not complaining one bit otherwise. The vibe was pretty chill and the music was appropriate.

To top it off, our server was extremely friendly and we loved our time! Would definitively go back there for a chill 5-7, or to work our Excel spreadsheets!"}
{"text":"Stylish wood and metal bar-pub on two floors, with loud but not raucous vibe and pleasant service. Our large party mostly ordered their poutines, which were inventive (shepherd's pie) if oversalted and sometimes a letdown (duck confit was a bit dry and not especially tasty, which is hard to manage when you're cooking something that fatty). The major disappointment was the range of mostly mediocre, occasionally terrible house beers. A promising \"summer weizen\" tasted like cough syrup - like with the duck confit, it was hard to fathom how that even happened. 

Unless someone is hosting a party here, there's nothing that would make me choose this place over El Rey del Taco next door for a meal, or Vices et Versa a few blocks away for pints."}
{"text":"A good place to get some good drinks at the Jean-Talon market. I had the red sangria and the pomme Ungava drink - both delicious. The crab cakes were a nice treat as well. Our server was very jovial and spoke English very well. A pleasant surprise! They have a nice covered patio in the front as well."}
{"text":"This place is great to have a beer or to get some upscale pub food.

Slightly expensive, but very tasty."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great place to take a break from shopping at the Jean Talon market, definitely venture inside. On a hot afternoon, I recommend the Gin tasting -- three different gins, paired with tonic or seltzer on the side. Beautiful that you can add no, some or lots of tonic/seltzer to your gin depending on your taste... 

The bartender was fantastic, explained each gin's variety, history and taste. She was friendly, welcoming and knowledgeable. I would give this place four stars based on the bar experience alone. However, since I didn't try anything off the food menu and can't speak about the food, I decided to give the establishment three stars."}
{"text":"Un bar à gin? Quelle bonne idée! Ici, je peux siroter un gin tonic sans me sentir comme une matante! 

La carte des gins est impressionnante; essayez une importation privée, car jamais vous ne retrouverez cela à la SAQ! Les cocktails créations maison ont l'air délicieux.

Moi, j'ai choisi un gin Barr Hill (Vermont), très doux, sucré avec un arrière--goût de miel en bouche. Très agréable avec le tonic! Ma tendre moitié a goûté au Saffron (France) un gin aromatisé au... safran! Il y a des gins pour tous les goûts! Super pour vous initier à cet alcool d'origine hollandaise!"}
{"text":"Blessed be, chicken and waffles are back on the brunch menu! Sometimes they are there, sometimes they aren't, you'll have to keep coming back!

 Thankfully the food is delicious: the eggs benedict are perfect with the salmon gravlax, the meat sandwich is humongous, but trailing behind are the avocado toast (good, but just that), and the cheeseburger, because it has Kraft cheese in it and NO. The place is beautiful, and if you come for brunch you might just be seated in the atrium/terrasse while they play some 80s grooves. Yay!"}
{"text":"Très bon brunchs, parfois avec des plats originaux, mais les portions sont malheureusement assez petites...
Le soir, excellents cocktails au Gin et ambiance sympa"}
{"text":"The drinks are expertly prepared, but the food is somewhat mediocre for the price.  Poutine was served warm and was a little pricey for the portion.  Great ambiance makes up for these shortcomings though.  Really energetic atmosphere."}
{"text":"We came here for the Piger Henricus gin tasting and ended up discovering an awesome spot. I'm telling you right off the bat though, that the reason I'm taking away one star is because the men's bathroom's door opens by itself and we had to constantly see guys peeing during our meal. Nope. No thank you!
The place is nice, like any normal bar. My friends and I like gin so we really enjoyed the gin list. The staff is great! Very aware and alert even though it was a total mad house.
Now, the food. Honestly, we didn't expect much and we were pleasantly surprised, in a very very good way. Everything was perfectly seasoned and tasted delicious. We took the pork cheek, duck confit, signature burger, Ungava gin gravlax and nachos (though we should have stopped right before the nachos lol!!! Yes, that's right, we ordered nachos AFTER our meal lol!!!)
I wpuld definitely recommend this place and would come back! :)"}
{"text":"Worst possible food ordered Pasta with Lamb and Vegetable Burger for my friend . Vegetable burger patty was dry and Lamb Pasta was a disaster."}
{"text":"Le Pourvoyeur is a neighbourhood pub located right next to the Jean Talon market.  It's your typical neighbourhood pub and prices are in line with what you pay elsewhere.  Le Pourvoyeur is a gin bar so if that is your alcohol of choice you will adore this place.  Don't worry if gin isn't your thing because you will also be sure to find drinks that don't contain it.

While I am not the biggest fan of straight gin I figured I would try the gin-based cocktails because it was a gin bar.  I ordered a couple of Negronis over the course of the night and there was a notable lack of consistency.  The first one was on point but the second one was way too potent and the gin had overpowered everything.  I enjoy the hint of bitterness that the Campari adds to the drink but I could barely taste it in the second one.

When discussing food once again there was a lack of consistency.  On this particular visit I ordered the ribs which were a little dry and not as tender as they should have been.  The fries  on the other hand were excellent.  They were crispy and had just the right amount of salt. 

This pub is okay but it doesn't blow me away.  If I am in the area I would consider returning but I doubt that I would make an effort to come here especially when you have other places nearby that are really good."}
{"text":"Véritable point de rencontre entre clients et travailleurs du Marché Jean-Talon, ce à bar gin nous accueilles dans son univers. Menu restreint mais adéquat afin de manger à sa faim. Match de hockey à la télé ou soirée entre amis , c'est l'endroit pour boire et se mettre à jour sur les derniers potins."}
{"text":"I wasn't really expecting the chicken and waffles to be good, but it was! The only downside is that my girlfriend asked for a vegetarian version and basically got no food on her plate, it wasn't as filling as mine, but I don't really hold it against them. I mean, that's what she gets for being picky! Just kidding. 

Location is really nice too, I picked the outdoor sitting because it just seemed too dark indoors, but some people might be into that, it is partly a pub after all."}
{"text":"Great vibe and location right by the market. Friendly hostess. The gin cocktails we had were well made. 
However... make sure you get the onion ring poutine. It is mad science."}
{"text":"Voyez-vous j'habite tout proche, donc ce bar c est un peu comme mon bar de quartier.

Avec une ambiance autant festive quand on veut oublier sa longue semaine de job, que Chill pour juste relaxer et jaser avec des amis le temps d'une bière ou d'un Gin.

Si jamais vous avez une petite faim, là aussi on saura vous combler, avec une carte variée et élaborée c est un tout autre type de bouffe de bar! 
On y retrouve des produits du marché, délicieusement mis en valeur."}
{"text":"loved the poutine au rondelle d'oignons !! pretty pricy but worth it !!! and the bloody maries are good !!"}
{"text":"Great place for a drink! Food is expensive but good. Try their seasonal lemonade - as refreshing as can be! Impressive selection of gins. Friendly service, all the waiters and waitresses we had were excellent."}
{"text":"Went in there big knowing much about Gin (other than Beefeater and Bombay, which lets be honest taste a bit like rubbing alcohol). Loved the comprehensive menu, it listed the flavour profile and feel of each gin. The staff is tremendously knowledgeable and super helpful. 
Each gin is served with a garnish to compliment its flavor profile. And the waiter recommended how it should be consumed (Tonic/ Soda) I even discovered a few that tasted amazing straight. Officially a gin convert. 

There is a decent food menu. Bar classics like pogos burgers, nuts, olives... classics slightly elevated without being pretentious! 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Aucune déception lors de cette visite au Pourvoyeur. Très bon service. Le goût était dans les assiettes. L'espace patio ouvert donnant sur les allées du marché Jean Talon présente un très grand charme."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. I had the hamburger from the lunch menu and my friend took the fish and chips. We were both pretty satisfied. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I am fan of almost any place that has a good beer list and is literally a stumble from the orange line. The place is cozy in the Winter and breezy in the summer; I love the covered terasse in the Winter as it's warm yet feels almost outdoorsy. The location cannot be beat, the wine, beer and cocktail lists are extensive and the appies are pretty decent. The bartenders are nicer than the servers, but that seems to be the trend at most places."}
{"text":"This is a fun casual place within Jean Talon marche. We enjoyed the fresh market salad with mixed greens, goat cheese, tomatoes, potatoes and corn kernels. Ice tea a little sweet but refreshing."}
{"text":"3.5

Some days, you just need a glass of wine. It was a chilly, wet day in Montreal and I was winding down my adventures. I had a hot date (more in a later review) to look forward to but I wanted to make sure that I was present and involved during every second of my trip. After all, I'd wanted to come here for years and, so far, the city had lived up to my expectations. Got it? Needed a place to while away some time. Chilly. Wet. I'm a drunk. Wait. What?

Consulting la reine et Yelp, I, first, wandered around a specialty grocery store that boasted cheese, beer, wine, and other goodies that were all local to Montreal in the micro and Canada in the macro. For an ignorant American, it was quite the education. But since I didn't buy anything there, I'm not reviewing it. Look for it while/when in the Jean Talon Market neighborhood. The window shopping had made me thirsty and la reine suggested just the place to warm up, chat a bit and get some wine.

She was right in all regards. LP's charming wood decor is, at once, both charming and hip. The upstairs is the perfect place for an event and the downstairs is where you'd want to take your friend/date/loved one to chat and sip. That's what we did. After having a chatty conversation with an earnestly nice bartender (the Miamian in me was not so trusting at first), we settled in with her recommendation for glasses. Not only was the glass poured with a stiff hand and tasted like buttery cherries, I couldn't help but be impressed by the cocktail menu. I wanted to try one but 1.) it was the afternoon 2.) I had places to be and 3.) What would the neighbors think? I don't know anything about the food situation but as a place to have a drink with a friend, LP is definitely digable."}
{"text":"Belle decoration, ambiance assurée, il y a une salle au deuxieme etage qui peut etre reservé pour evenements de danse, meetings etc, c'est bonne à savoir. DJ sur place. J'ai juste dansé donc j'ai aucune idée de la bouffe haha."}
{"text":"I've only ever had the pleasure of visiting Le Pourvoyeur during the evening, but every experience I've had thus far has left my inner-gin-sipping-elderly-man squealing with glee.

The first time I visited this bar my friend admitted to our waiter that she knew nothing about gin and was apprehensive. He carefully took the time to explain to her how to enjoy gin and recommended an easy-sipping selection that left her, at the end of the evening, a regular gin fan. I was impressed.

Also, the decor and layout to this place is tasteful yet unpretentious and I'm sure it gets better with daylight.

Seriously, I couldn't be more pleased that there's a good gin bar on the island."}
{"text":"Adjacent to the Marche Jean Talon, this place is a great place to stop for a beverage in between shopping for fresh food at the market. Le Pourvoyeur was highly recommended by a local and we really enjoyed the atmosphere, outdoor seating overlooking the market, and selection of gin. Quiet during the day and afternoon, but started getting busy around dinnertime."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée un midi, j'ai trouvé mon plat vraiment bon et original (gaufre à la bière, salade de pastèque (je crois) et ailes de poulet frites avec une sauce au miel). L'ambiance est sympa, le service est excellent et le lieu est agréable. Je ne vois aucunes raisons de ne pas y retourner régulièrement."}
{"text":"Excellent endroit à tout point de vue ou presque. Seul problème, le service que la compétence douteuse (je reste poli !) de certains serveurs / certaines serveuses rend très (trop) aléatoire. Aujourd'hui, après 1h20 d'attente nous sommes par exemple repartis sans manger ..."}
