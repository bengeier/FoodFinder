{"text":"Love this place!!! So excited that there is proper Mexican food in the area. Oh, I know the owners from my time in the area and they are the best. Say hi to Lupe when you're there. An incredible guy, Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. The tortillas are fresher and tastier than a place like Qdoba or Chipotle, and at similar price. Not too greasy either. Try one of the Jarritos sodas with the food; we tried the grapefruit soda and loved it. The place was busy but our service was very fast. The owners were friendly and were the best part of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Best taco place in Middleton.  My favorite are the pork tacos, my girlfriend likes the steak tacos and the rice.  Guacamole could be better but overall good food and a fair price.  I recommend this place over chipotle, qudoba or any other Mexican restaurant in Middleton"}
{"text":"We tried Lupe's today, excited for a new Mexican restaurant in Middleton.    Food - we had a cheese quesadilla, chicken burrito, and a few tacos.  Everything was very tasty, nice assortment of meat choices and toppings.  If you like a little heat, I recommend their hot sauce as a topping on any of their dishes.  The mexican rice isn't anything fancy, but tasted good too as a side.   This is counter service like a Qdoba, not a sit down restaurant, but we liked the simple menu.  Prices - in line with what you would expect for a smaller Mexican restaurant, perhaps the taco at $2.25 is a steal based on the generous amount of toppings.   Atmosphere - Like others have written, it is well decorated with bright colors and some fun painting on the wall.  The music was nice, the TV was a little strange as they had wrestling on which was interesting enough, then it switched over to some strange Mexican movie.  Opportunities for improvement - There are just a few things that need to be fixed up to get to 5 stars in my opinion.  One is that if you want some water to drink, you need to pay for it and get a bottle of water which is purchased from the nearby Copps.  There is no fountain soda service.  Also, there was very limited 4-top seating, almost all the tables were for 2 people though you could push some tables together if it isn't too busy.  Considering it just opened recently, the restaurant is on the right track and we will be back again."}
{"text":"Ok, I am officially addicted. This restaurant is exactly what the neighborhood needed. Fast, fresh, good food. A perfect complement to the other offerings on the street and my go to place when I need a quick, reasonable lunch.  Love the tacos with fresh corn tortillas. Made my own rice and bean bowl today, which was delicious."}
{"text":"Hands down the best taco's in Madison. Steak or Pork tacos made fresh with warm flour or corn tortillas. Very friendly and laid back place to eat in."}
{"text":"This was one of those places which my boyfriend was skeptical about, why? Because he is Mexican and he just wants to go to the places where he thinks it's closer to the authentic Mexican flavors he knows. Well, if it wasn't for me (I'm always insisting in trying new places) he would have never known if it was good or not. Short story, he liked it, yayyy for me because that means we will be back :)    As soon as you step in, a wonderful aroma of homemade corn tortillas captivate your senses and makes you walk even faster into the counter where you need to stand and order your food.  First, you need to tell them if you want tacos, burritos, tostadas, quesadillas, tortas, etc, then into the meat (shredded chk, roasted pork, picadillo (a mix of ground pork and beef), chorizo (it has cubed potatoes) and beef. It doesn't come with rice and beans automatically, there is an extra charge for those so it's up to you if you want them or not. Last but not least, you pick your toppings and what kind of spicy salsa you like.  Ok, let's get to the exciting part, the food!! we both liked their tacos (chorizo, beef and roasted pork) they were tasty and interesting because each meat had its own distinctive flavor, not like other places where you don't even know which one is which. Rice and beans were nice too. I loved their roasted tomatillo sauce, it tasted so fresh and not too spicy.   In my opinion, the food is a little bit expensive, but good enough to come back if you have a craving for homey texmex food like me from time to time :)"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and so good! Choose your meats and/or toppings on tacos, burritos quesadillas and salads. The salsas are tasty, especially the tomatillo. And the guacamole is to die for. The servers are friendly, and the dining room is clean and bright. I just love Lupe's!"}
{"text":"WE. LOVE. THIS. PLACE. The decor is bright, fun, clean, and open. The cool lucha libre murals on the walls were actually painted by one of the owner's relatives. The service was fast and super friendly. I had 2 tacos (one pork, one chicken), and my dining companion had a picadillo burrito. All the ingredients tasted fresh and were of high quality. I can't wait to go back to try more! This is the perfect addition to the other great restaurants in this little area."}
{"text":"Nice place simple menu and good service. Had the tacos, they were flavorful and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My ladies cycling group, Spoke Haven, hosts a Taco Tuesday the 1st Tuesday of each month and Lupe's has been on our list for awhile. I am so glad we finally made it! In fact, we cut our ride a little short in order to get to Lupe's before closing time. The restaurant is set up so that you can build your own (taco, burrito, torts, salad bowl etc...). Fillings include several proteins and typical taco toppings. My only disappointment was the lack of substantial vegetarian options...maybe include some sauteed vegetables? Lupe was incredibly accommodating to our group of hungry and thirsty cyclists. I could tell she loves what she's doing andvit shows in the food quality and top notch customer service!"}
{"text":"I love the simplicity of this place. 1. Clear cut menu.  2. Delicious food.  3. Clean, modest space with a lot of natural light.  4. Not overly decorated. Just a few bold colored chairs and some fun Lucha Libre murals. 5. Courteous workers.   I got chips, guacamole, and a giant chicken burrito. I didn't have to eat again the rest of the day. ¡Bueno!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time, and it was terrific. Fresh and flavorful - delicious!"}
{"text":"Quick, fresh, delicious, reasonably priced Mexican food. Convenient to get to and lots of parking. Very friendly staff. Comfortable and quiet seating, nice view."}
{"text":"My husband and I live within walking distance of Lupe's so we were excited to try it out when it opened. Honestly, we were underwhelmed our first visit, but I swear it's gotten better every single time we've been back. Now we go weekly!  I love the shredded chicken tacos and my husband favors the steak tacos. They are so fresh and the toppings are awesome--even fresh cilantro is an option to sprinkle on top. I love Mexican food and I would say this place is a great local option."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love going here for a quick and tasty bite. It's a small, family run restaurant and the owners are a delight.  Every time I get the exact same thing: 1-2 tacos ($2.50 each), flour tortilla, rice, steak, pico de gallo (a tomato/onion/cilantro mix), cotijo cheese (I highly recommend this over the other cheese they have; it just isn't the same) & tomatillo salsa - so fresh and perfect each and every time. The mexican corn as a side is also quite good. I'd pass on the desserts - head across the street to Menchie's if you have a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Consistently the best Mexican food in the area. I've been going here 1-4 times/mo since they opened, and I have walked away satisfied every single time."}
{"text":"Stopping at the new taqueria on the block.  Buritto bowl tastiier than Qdoba.  Light and fresh.  Delicious.  Soft shell corn taco or flour.  I also had the corn soft taco with the beef.  Tender and not greasy like other places.  Like I said, well prepared and thought out. My new favorite spot.  Wow...and a place that plays some Mexican soft music in the background.  A nice relaxing and yummy lunch and dinner spot."}
{"text":"With a four star average I had high expectations. These two stars reflect my disappointment.   Came in for tacos and opted for three different meat options. I selected cilantro, onion, cortijo cheese, sliced jalapeños and salsa as toppings.  When the resulting basket was put on the counter, I knew I would be disappointed.   Portion sizes were sad, and my chicken taco had about half of the meat compared to the other two. Picadillo and chicken meats were bland, steak was the only option worth repeating.   The corn tortillas were poor, they were falling apart but still thick, with a rubbery texture. This is the complete opposite of what I look for in a tortilla.   We also made the mistake of ordering chips and guacamole. For $4.50 we received a two ounce foam container of very acidic guac, and a paper bag of reheated bargain brand tortilla chips.   The hunt for decent Mexican in Dane county continues."}
{"text":"I Love this place!  The food is excellent and very affordable!  I would eat here everyday if I could.  Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Everything about it is great: the location, the concept, the food, the prices, etc.     FOOD:  I've been several times over the last few weeks and the food has been consistent each time.  The burritos are a great size (not too small, not overflowing and hard to eat) and have always tasted fresh.  Chips are seasoned to perfection and the guacamole is superb and easily some of the best I have ever had.    PRICE: I get a bean and rice burrito ($7.25) with a side of chips and guac which totals around $10 and change.  So, not a cheap meal by any means, but the quality is there and I think worth it and they make most everything from scratch that they serve.  INTERIOR: Nice and small with vibrant colors.  I've always gotten to-go orders, but it seems like a nice place to eat in at.  And in warmer months/days, they have outside eating areas.  STAFF: Always courteous and service is prompt.  There have been lines in the past, but they work through them quickly as the menu is not that large so choices are fewer and therefore streamlined."}
{"text":"This was good and they are very friendly but the Torta's are VERY small for the price . It's the size of a basic sandwich. Definitely not what I was expecting!"}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty ingredients prepared in advance, ready to pile into your salad bowl, taco, or burrito. Think Chipotle but local!   They had a few agua frescas available and we tried the horchata, which was sweet and cinnamony. My steak salad hit the spot but get it with beans, which I neglected to do. My lunch buddy said the burrito was the best non-Mexican burrito he's ever had, with good quality ingredients and well-seasoned beans like he might make himself at home. But then he was like, \"well, maybe it IS Mexican food, there are different regions in Mexico, what do I know about  authenticity anyway\" like any self-conscious millennial might say while chowing down on \"ethnic\" American cuisine. Two horchatas, a steak salad with guac, and burrito came out to about $20+.   The interior was full of colorful chairs and paint, with cheeky murals adorning the walls and a tv in the corner showing old wrestling matches on silent. Old school music playing in the background lent to a pleasant dining experience, fun for a small group of lively friends or the whole family."}
{"text":"Great vegan tacos!! Two kinds of beans, and all the veggies. Guacamole is free with a veggie taco when you don't order meat. Horchata contains dairy, but the hibiscus agua fresca is delicioso!"}
{"text":"Bam! This place! You'll definitely have to check out Lupe's--great little taco shop that you (probably) didn't know existed.   Service is pretty much like chipotle (but the food is better)--walk up to the counter, pick a shell, meat, toppings and beans or rice. Two fantastic tacos for five bucks! I had the pork and steak both were spot on. Salsa selections were also very good.   This is my kind of place, simple menu, fun atmosphere, and great service. And hey, you can even grab a beer!"}
{"text":"Went there last week. Cute little place with a limited menu like Chipotle/Qdoba.  Fresh ingredients with a good balance of spice with the meat dishes. We ordered pork, chicken and vegetarian tacos. They were all delicious.  Veggie tacos were a bit bland, came with 2 beans,  yellow corn and side of guacamole.  Wish they had hot sauces and sliced lemons available to help yourself with.  Will be back."}
{"text":"This place was a surprise--I expected ok, I got very good. Great food, clean/uncluttered, and fast (iPad checkout (tip option available)). I had 3 tacos (2 corn, 1 flour) with a chicken, pork, and picadillo meat and they were terrific! Great pico, thick salty chips, wonderful green salsa, loved the chopped jalapeño \"salsa\" on the tacos. Go here. I'm full, but I want to eat more; perhaps tomorrow."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed the burrito with beans and rice. It was comparble to something like Qdoba although with less variety on the menu but similar quality. The salsa was great as was the guacamole, next time I will try it with sour cream. The only thing I would say is for the salad get some darker greens rather than the iceberg. Seating is pretty limited, outside on a nice day - you better grab your table quick!"}
{"text":"I like this place! $2.75 for a very decent taco, that you can build the way you want it.  Hard to find anything at that price anymore.  I've tried the beef, pork, chorizo, and the mix.  I like the pork and the chorizo best.  Haven't had a burrito or some of the other sides, but everything is fresh and tasty. Obviously family owned, so they care what you think.  I also like the aqua Fresca and horchata. Great addition to the area."}
{"text":"Simple Mexican joint that has some basic stuff - burrito, taco, nachos, quesadillas. You can choose your protein and toppings. Pretty reasonably priced. I got a burrito with rice and black beans and cojita cheese. It was ok. The medium green salsa was very good. The hubby and kid got tres leches cake and both loved it. If you want something simple, fast and want to support a local business this is a good choice."}
{"text":"We were disappointed when half of our take-out order for our family of four was made incorrectly. Our daughter's burrito had no chicken on it--just rice, beans and salsa. I guess the price of disappointment is fairly high."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I have recently become obsessed with mexican food, and this place is the spot my boyfriend and I have been going to a lot recently. It's a small cute place with a really nice vibe. Their mexican corn is to die for and its hands down my favorite thing on their menu. The restaurant itself is a build your own type place, with tacos, burritos, quesadillas, etc. I would recommend this to any mexican food lover and just everyone in general!"}
{"text":"Just tried this location last week! The tacos are fresh and taste way better than the chain places around. Can't beat having fresh horchata with my lunch either! Prices are right on and I was more than satisfied with the value of my meal. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I got the steak burrito and I'm impressed. I like the flavor, yet it's not too different if you don't like trying new things. I just love this place and everyone is super nice! I appreciate that. If you haven't tried this place yet it's a must! Good fresh ingredients ! Please support this place I don't want this place going away!!  Super delicious!"}
{"text":"Best best best Mexican place in the Madison area. Very simple menu with authentic fresh food and friendly service. Hopefully it continues to be good."}
{"text":"Tried their chorizo and pork tacos. Just average. I've had better ones in Madison. Not going back"}
{"text":"I think Lupe's is great I had the burrito with roasted pork, pinto beans, rice, red sauce, and all the veggies for about $7.25. I'd rather go here than Qdoba or Chipotle; support local cuisine! There were people coming in and out the entire time I was there today around noon. The food is fresh, super tasty, and I definitely plan to go there again."}
{"text":"Compared to La Tienda Los Gemelos, and even Laredo's, this just doesn't stack up. The meat tends to be somewhat watered down, with flavors that didn't have all that much impact. If you're looking for al pastor you won't find it here, it's much more frill than substance.  The cook also asked me if I had been there before, and he arrogantly said \"Oh you'll be back.\" Well sorry Lupe's, but I haven't returned.  EDIT:  I still have not been back, as Gloria's has opened up on Junction Rd. If you enjoy good tacos, then there are much better options in town."}
{"text":"The four of us decided to have a family night out and chose this as our dinner before the movie we had tickets for. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed our meals. The boys each had a burrito and my wife and I had tacos. You choose the items you want in each and watch them make it right in front of you. Yummy, fresh and quite inexpensive. A great addition to Middleton."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food at a reasonable price! Had the corn soft tacos with pico and cilantro. Tasty! Will be back soon to try the burritos!"}
{"text":"Pork and veggie tacos both awesome.  That's all I've had.  Sauces, tortillas, and everything else are great.  It's a simple place with good food and fair prices."}
{"text":"I am a returning customer.  It is SO GOOD. You must have cilantro on it....  It just brings out the flavors.  You can always expect really beautiful,  fresh,  delicious ingredients here.  Beautiful  food.  Beautiful  people.  I love this place.  Horchata is wonderful to cool your pallette if you are like me. ( I always add a lot of jalapeños.)    if you haven't been there  you are missing out on a really handy place to eat in or even to grab food to bring home.  We really like it."}
{"text":"SUPPORT LOCAL!!!  Lupe has always dreamed of opening his own place, worked tirelessly at another nearby taco place and waited until his kids graduated high school and took the plunge. The food here is super fresh, very tasty, and support the  American Dream!   Please come out and eat at Lupe's. I know you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Years ago, the owners' family established the second-ever authentic, as in Mexican-owned, restaurant in the history of Wisconsin. This alone does not a fantastic restaurant make, but it does help to explain the obvious attention to detail put into the offerings of what from the street appears to be yet another choice among the many fast-casual, Mexican-style places popping up here and everywhere. Four stars because you can't get five without enchiladas on the menu, but no need to change for me. The salsas are fresh and handmade, unlike the salty, jarred or prepped-offsite products you get at Lupe's chain competitors. Ditto for the tortillas. I like that you can walk up and put together whatever you're in the mood for, choosing all of your own ingredients -- chorizo (ok), chicken or carnitas (great) or picadillo (their own pork/beef combo) -- and combining them into a taco, burrito, quesadilla, salad, bowl, torta or nachos. Add your choice of salsa (get that ranch stuff they just added!), fresh veggies and an ice-cold Pacifico, and you have yourself a fiesta buena that you can claim you put together yourself, in a matter of seconds, at a great price. Ole!"}
{"text":"Ordered a torta. Bread was wrong. It was like a taco got dumped on a bad piece of bread. Not authentic. Whitewashed garbage.  Totally understand they have to cater to their consumer, but it was just bad, not even as good as Chipotle."}
{"text":"The food is good and I went there several times.  I recommend trying it out for yourself.  It's set up like Subway, where you watch them put your food together and pick exactly what you want on it.  It tastes good.  I've had better, but I've also had worse.  The food is a little above average for Mexican.  The value isn't that great.  I didn't get any sides, just one item and a drink, and it's always $10+.  It's enough food for lunch, but I should really be full after paying that much, and that's before tip.......  I rated it one star less than I would have because of tipping.  They encourage tipping, but this is not a sit-down restaurant with servers.  I tipped a couple times because I felt pressured to, but then I just stopped going there and I think that's part of the reason.  Along with having a tip jar present, when you pay with a card, they flip the screen to you and tell you to \"choose and sign\".  There's options for no tip, 15%, 18%, etc.  For anyone wanting to call me cheap for not just shutting up and tipping, that's fine, but make sure you tip at Subway and McDonald's to avoid being a hypocrite.  They don't fill your drinks or anything, there are fountain drinks that you pour yourself just like at any other fast food restaurant.  So....yeah.  If you're in the area and want some quick Mexican food, give it a shot.  But if you don't, you won't live the rest of your life regretting it.  It's OK."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! They have by far the best Mexican food in/around Madison, no to mention that they are so friendly and have great prices!"}
{"text":"Moving from the West Coast, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to find an awesome burrito place in Madison. After eating here, I'm no longer worried. Seriously delicious. If you have a sweet tooth, try the hibiscus aqua fresca. Amazing place."}
{"text":"This is now my Go To place for authentic Mexican food - soul food to me. They even put papas in the chorizo like we did back home. The carnitas are always good and the rice has the texture and flavor I want. Glad to see it was the restaurant of choice for a lot of folks who felt compelled to eat Mexican on Cinco De Mayo. I toast you all, it was nice to see you there."}
{"text":"Great fresh ingredients. Tasty beef tacos and burritos. Fresh ingredients better than chipotle."}
{"text":"Beef burrito was great! Lots of flavor and fresh ingredients.  I like the idea of trying a local place instead of a chain."}
{"text":"Mom and I are on a mission to try lots of new Mexican food joints.  Lupe's came up and it was time to check it out.  Doing some research, I knew it would have the Qdoba/Chipotle-like \"watch them make your burrito\" system, so there were no surprises there.  I was tempted to go with three tacos instead, but I couldn't resist the burrito.  I went with the steak (shredded) and it was pretty decent.  I felt it was a little dry, but once I got to the \"wet\" toppings (sour cream, salsa), it was better.  With the build-your-own model, I liked being able to ask for a little of this, a little of that, versus just getting what they put on it for you.  Overall, it was good - I'd have it again, but with all the competition out there, I'm not sure I'd trek across town when there are other options closer to me.  Their location is great for the businesses and housing in that area.  Next time, I'll probably go with the tacos and see how that goes.  I feel like three stars is a bit low - it's better than that, but like I said, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to have it."}
{"text":"Not sure where in the world you 5 star reviewers dine. This is not a 4 or 5 star eatery. The food taste is okay, but getting this type of Mexican food in an assembly line ranks up there with Chipotle and that isn't Mexican food.  I hate to give low reviews, but this place underwhelms. While the food is okay at best, the whole process is not worth the effort. Some people like this way of ordering, I don't. The food temp isn't hot enough and who knows how long it sits there.   Please stop giving such high reviews to these places. You just skew the process Yelp is designed for in reviewing restaurants. This is not a 4 or 5 star restaurant. Maybe 3 on a good day.  There are much better Mexican restaurants in the area. Don't be fooled by this ranking."}
{"text":"Went with my husband to try it out. We both got 3 tacos. And they were pretty good. The chorizo was not burned like how they serve it in most places. It had good flavor and the Horchata was tasty. We will be back."}
{"text":"Raised the prices?  how can habaneros make a bigger better burrito for 6.25? 3 dollars less!!!??? Lupe's does not even have those nice pickled onions.  I mean if you have no car and cannot get to habaneros, I guess stop in but be warned, over 9 bucks for a simple veggie burrito!  Follow up, someone who clearly works at Lupe's messaged me letting me know this was a mistake so I guess you can just make sure you get charged right."}
{"text":"Let's get real here. The current rating on Yelp for this restaurant is 4.5. This is not a 4.5-worthy restaurant. It's a nice place. The people who work there are very nice. It's clean. The food is good. But it's not a 4.5, IMO. And the folks rating it 5.0 are clearly on drugs. The food is good. I had a pork burrito with refried beans, jalapeños, tomatoes, onions, cheese and sour cream. I had asked for lettuce but did not get any. When the young man making the burrito asked if I wanted guacamole, I said, \"Sure!\" Then I saw him pick up a plastic tube of guac and point it at my burrito. That's when I said, \"Um, no thanks on the guac.\" A 5.0 restaurant, in my opinion, does not have guac in a tube. Like I said, the burrito was good. Nothing earth shattering. The pork was moist. The flavor overall was fine. The price was fair. The only kicker (besides people rating this a 5 restaurant) was when I paid. I used a credit card and the restaurant has one of those new fancy iPad deals where you're able to sign your name with your finger and choose a tip. Choose a tip? For what? Making my food? I was taken aback when I saw the option to tip. I tip waiters at restaurants all the time. And if they do a good job, I always tip at least 20%. But I'm talking about tipping waiters that bring me water, drinks, dinner, dessert, extra napkins, ketchup, etc. I tip waiters that come back to the table to see if everything is okay or if I need something else. I don't understand why I would tip in this situation. I ended up clicking the \"15% button\" for the tip. I don't know why. I'm an adult. I could have chosen to tip \"None\" but I didn't' want to look like a jerk. As I was eating my burrito I thought about the situation and started to become a bit perturbed. Everybody wants a friggin tip these days. I'm sure some of you will message me and set me straight on why the guy who made my burrito deserves a tip. Go ahead. I'll read it. I'm not going to get in an argument about it though. So, overall, I had a fine experience at this restaurant. It is a solid 3, IMO."}
