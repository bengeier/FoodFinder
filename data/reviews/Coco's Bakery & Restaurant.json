{"text":"Love this place. It's the perfect place go when your hungry and want some  \"normal\" food at a great price. The service is the best,and everyone is so friendly."}
{"text":"A year ago my sweetie and I ate here a few times and were happy. Tonight we came with her two daughters and had a vile experience. The steak was horribly fatty. The ranch had lumps. The broccoli was actually moldy. We showed it to the manager Lisa. She acknowledged that it did not look fresh. She squeezed out an apology. She comped the dinner. I can only hope that a little girl does not get food poisoning later. Consider yourself warned. Oh yeah. The service completely sucked!!!"}
{"text":"Last week we were driving home from work very hungry at 4:30pm and wanted to try somewhere we hadn't been in a while. My fiancé said he used to eat at the Coco's in Chandler frequently before they closed and suggested this. Upon entering the restaurant I had a bad feeling. The interior was severely dated and decked out in hideous shades of orange from the late 70's early 80's. The windows carpet and booths could have all used a good cleaning. We sat down and looked over the menu and decided to keep it simple. My fiance' ordered the Chopped Steak dinner entrée (well done with no pink) and I went with a Prime Rib Mushroom Cheeseburger  (some pink). We received our beverages quickly which was welcomed on a hot day and waited for our food. And waited, and waited...45 minutes later after asking our waitress twice where our meals were she proudly brought them out. It was immediately clear we had made a huge mistake. My burger went back immediately because at first glance it was obvious I had not been served the burger I ordered. No thinly sliced prime rib and no mushrooms. The burger bun was stale and the burger itself was a cold severely overcooked frozen thin hockey puck. I was immediately promised it would be replaced and it was whisked off back to the kitchen. I then looked at my fiancé's Chopped Steak dinner and saw it consisted of the same thin 1/4lb hockey puck also severely overcooked with a scoop of masked potatoes beside it and GRAY Gravy slathered all over it. The waitress had disappeared (never to come to our table again and refill drinks) and four minutes later the manager arrived with my \"correct\" burger. The same burger and fries I was originally served was put in front of me and when I complained he said \"I took it back and had the sliced prime rib and mushrooms added!\" It was still cold, still overcooked, and had lettuce and condiments on it that did not belong! I demanded it go back and be taken off our bill and after seeing my fiancé's dinner opted not to eat at all. When we questioned the manager about the \"Chopped Steak\" he said they had been serving the same 1/4lb hamburger patty as their \"Chopped Steak\" since he began working for the restaurant. He took care of our entire bill and even offered a gift card to have us come back but we declined because if that was their standard fare we certainly were not coming back again. The pie's in the front case looked appetizing but this is not the Coco's food of old and I certainly would not even chance those. There are too many other excellent choices for dinner and dessert at restaurants within a mile."}
{"text":"Awful service.  Never saw server JC again after she took the order.  Nobody ever checked back to see I everything was okay and coffee was not refilled.  The check wasn't even brought to the table.  I guess all It must be poor management because all Coco's seem to have problems from CA to AZ."}
{"text":"Service was surprisingly faster then the last couple reviews. Maybe because there was only one other party dining in also? Service wasn't as friendly, why act like smiling hurts? I ordered the eggs benedict served with hash browns. Nothing to brag about. Don't think it was worth the $8.99 price. The hash browns were good, especially served with onions. The hollandaise sauce isnt as \"rich\" as they advertised. My daughter had the classic French toast. That wasn't worth  $8 either. The scrambled eggs and bacon that came with it was good and tasty but the french toast was so bland and tasteless, my daughter wouldn't touch it. All in all, the $18.90 bill wasn't worth the $5 tasting food..... I give 2 stars for fast service."}
{"text":"I have been coming to cocos for years now I still get the same thing, everyone nows me by name and are like my second family."}
{"text":"This is the second (and last) time I've come here. The service is slow, the food sucks, and the manager appears to be sedated on what I can only guess must be some sort of opiod medication.  It also appears as though the store has not been vacuumed in quite some time.  I'm actually writing this review live from inside the restaurant, and it took the staff longer to take my drink order than it did for me to write this review."}
{"text":"Took over 30 minutes to serve a fried appetizer and two salads. Salads were missing avocados. Only 4 people in entire restaurant. Truly ridiculous. Horrible service, horrible food.  Don't go here."}
{"text":"So we had just arrived in town, it was late and we needed to eat.  We were going to eat at the buffet, but it was too expensive for what you got.  We ended up just thinking we'd grab something at Cocos and be done.  The service was so slow, it was ridiculous. We were seated quickly, and our orders were taken quickly but then things got bad.   The place was not even 25% full, and we sat there for what seemed like an eternity. We had agreed that if our food didn't arrive in 5 more minutes, we were out of there and it was going to be fast food.  The food arrived at 4+ minutes.  Total wait for food was over 25 minutes.  Once it arrived, it was mediocre at best.  I would never go back.  Too many other options in a town like Vegas.  Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"It's ok! That sums it up. The service was ok...the food was ok. This location use to be so fantastic yet over the last 6 months or so, it seems as if they have lost their motivation to see repeat customers. I hope to see the return of the Cocos I use to know!"}
{"text":"Called the day before to order 2 peach pies.  Picked them up on Sunday morning.  Nobody knew how to run the cash register.  Took me over 10 minutes to get my change and be out of there.  Pies were the worst I've ever eaten.  Uncooked peaches (looked to me to be nectarines).  Crunchy and not ripe whatsoever.  Had to remove the peaches and modify and bake.  Hardly any flavor and the skins were tough and bitter.  We all got sick from it.  I will never return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Like a Denny's. Big parking lot and short walk to the door   Wait to be seated. The place looked unkept but the only waiter was quick to take our order and the food arrived fast. Can't complain about the price. A chef salad and deep fried shrimp dinner for $15."}
{"text":"Excellent service from jacquie. Food was served in a timely manner and was very tasty. Would highly recommend to all. Excellent experience :-)"}
{"text":"I'm slightly surprised to see the low ratings for this place. I would actually give it a 3.5 stars. This is a place I used to dine frequently. Mainly because they were conveniently located at Santa Fe Station which is down the street to me.  I agree their service can be pretty bad sometimes, especially more recently. Maybe it might be because they will be closing soon as the Grand Cafe will be reopening in it's place...  The food and the service used to be better but it really has gone downhill. Though I still enjoy their bakery. And their seasonal menu is still interesting. I must say I do enjoy their sweet potato fries.  Their croissant sandwich is also yummy.   Try to stay away from chicken or broccoli here, I have had pieces that were bitter. eww. But you can't go wrong with their desserts, they are yummy! From the cookies to seasonal pies, etc. I went there around 4pm to have breakfast one day (it is served 24 hours but you have to ask for the breakfast menu. But the servers have no clue have to serve breakfast and what it comes with). I was so excited to find they had red velvet pancakes! But it was such a fail. The flavor and texcture of the pancakes were not good. And because it wasn't a breakfast server, she didn't know about a whipped cream cheese that should've came with it. Overall just not good...  When Coco's is gone, I might miss it. Mainly for their bakery.  This review is long overdue and I can't even remember the details. Overall, though, I do like this place for a quick bite and some sweets when I happen to be at Santa Fe Station, but would not go out of my way to dine here."}
{"text":"Visited Sunday 8:30 am, like this Coco's best because I can go as a single person and not standout in a sea of families.  I always sit in the separate sitting are with the counter (and booths that hold 2 peope). Typically my food is excellent. Wait staff service is iffy on how fast it is, and if your coffee is refilled.  Wait staff are long timers and good, but the place seems to be short staffed all the time. Every time you check out--in my experience--there is a line at the register--it's either not staffed or the person is in efficient. On Sunday it took 20 min to check out and pay.  And it was the Coco's lady at the counter--not the customers.  The pie orders are very manual and take a long time.  The lady here today did not know how to process a coupon for the customer in front of me--she had to call a manager to authorize it.  She was also answering callers from outside--who were ordering those slow manual pie orders.  The line was still stacked up to 8 behind me (like it was when I got in line).  It's a backup line becuase it's so slow and inefficient.  The checkout needs help. The restaurant was maybe 1/2 full when I cam in, but all 5 of the booths in the room with the counter, were not bussed, and two seats at the counter too.  It took a long time to get my order taken, and my food was not hot when it was delivered (it was sitting up there.  The lady serving the counter room was also serving the dining room customers --same as last time I visited when this same scenario playyed out.  Not sure if people are calling in sick, they had a special big party, or they just are short staffed, or trying to save money on staff.  The assistnt manager that looks to be on duty, can help refill coffee and stuff, but moslty he's a little oafy in handlign his apparently new duties or fill-in duties at this restaurant--though people seem to know him--he is not very efficient at makign the restaurant run efficiently.  The wait staff seem to tolerate him, no appreciate where he does try to insert himself--I find him not a good manager.    THis is symptomatic of my 3 visits the past month.  I orderd pumpkin nut pancakes--very good--exctite that serving of \"pumpkin chiffon\" that seems to be flavored butter, but tastes like thick gross frosting that is pumpkin flavored.  It did not melt on the pancakes and was intolerable."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this coco's.  The service is is excellent. There has only been one time that we haven't received excellent service and the manager made sure to make things right. She comp'd our meal (we were in a group of 8) & gave us a free meal the next time we come (since we were regulars). Didn't expect that. But i assume its because we were here celebrating with family the fact that my hubby and I had just gotten married and were pregnant.  The next time we came we ordered an app, two entrees and drinks and it all came to be free. how nice!   Will always come back."}
{"text":"Ok party of five; 4-2-11  We should have walked out as soon as they said they ran out of rootbeer.   They are getting ready to close this location down so the staff there is not very attentive.  It seems that the chef has lost morale.  Our bread came burnt, and was informed that we would get more and didn't.  I wanted bluberries in my salad and didn't get them.  My husband ordered fish n chips....they ran out of fish......My moms asian salad was too spicy......my son ordered scampi pasta and he said it was too lemony,  my youngest son ordered a burger and loved it.    The whole time the waitress named Becca, said she was gonna \"get \" the chef.......whatever.......because she still served the food.......  BOO on them!  I love writing a good review........but my last couple haven't been.......I think I'm going to go shopping and cook at home!!"}
{"text":"We use to go to Coco's in Mesa 2 or 3 time a month, usually for a late evening meal on a long day that we weren't able to eat at the regular times.  One evening we found something cooked with the eggs and have never gone back.  The manager said it was just a part of a shrimp shell (even though it really resembled something that use to crawl around) , but my question to him was \"if your staff can't clean the pots and pans well enough to have someone else's dinner as part of mine, is this any place to eat\"?.  And that's the last time we did.  If you go to this place, examine what they bring you very thoroughly."}
{"text":"Cheap breakfast that is mediocre.  The service is mediocre.  The bathroom is stinky, I had to hold my breathe."}
{"text":"Weekend staff are nice and friendly.  I come here every Saturday and the experience never changes or gets better.  Come early for fast seating.  Late morning equals big wait. Great food"}
{"text":"I recently went here since I always past by it everyday. Well I was glad that I did. I was greeted with a huge smile as I walked in the door. I went in the morning and surprisingly it was not packed. I sat at the counter and was again greeted by this time my waitress. Breakfast was outstanding and service was great. I defiantly will be back."}
{"text":"I belong to a fairly large network group that comes here for breakfast every Wednesday morning.  We have the back room for our use.  I've always been happy with everything I've ordered here.  I pretty much stick to the same breakfast every time and our designated server, Jacque, who always knows what the regulars want.  She is amazing, has the biggest heart and cares about all of her customers.  She has been serving the group for over 15 years and we all love her."}
{"text":"After going here at least once a week for the past few months I guess it's about time I reviewed at least one of my experiences. Luckily I'm not the only one who has some serious gripes with the service at this location. Actually, it is a possibility that we had the same clueless, passive aggressive waitress who had no clue what was going on.  Seeing as this place is open 24/7 and has some really good combination plates for breakfast you can't really go wrong. A great tip is to order the Weekday Special(don't worry about what is written on the menu, not even the price is correct). Every time I order it they make it fast, delicious, and $2 less than menu price which sits well with my Jewish ass.   Recently we have been running into the late night creepy/awful wait staff but the fast, delicious food more than makes up for it. Their omelets are always fluffy and tasty and their pancakes really hit the spot. Just make sure to say your order slowly and clearly enough so that the half brain-dead staff can give you what you really want. 24/7 breakfast that doesn't make you feel like death(*cough*IHOP*cough*) deserves at least 4 stars but the subpar wait staff really drags this location down."}
{"text":"We have been going to this Coco's for several years.  About a year ago it started to not be as good, but then around 6 months ago things got much better.  Now we love the Service, Food, and the Prices are good.  They have greatly expanded and improved their Menu, and everything we have tried tastes great! The manager (Marcos) is very friendly and helpful, and all of the servers take great care of us.  Now we are visiting Coco's about 3 times a week. So happy that things have improved so much lately - we expect them to do very well now."}
{"text":"Just ordered 5 pies for Thanksgiving. TERRIBLE!!! Crusts were so thick and raw. Pecan pie filling was so chewy it had to be thrown away! They have lost a lifelong customer! Mary Hedges"}
{"text":"Dinner last night was fine for me but not so for my wife so I'll give it 2.5 stars.  I had a grilled chicken breast with bruschetta topping.  The bruschetta was seasoned nicely, and I thought the dish was OK.  My wife had a grilled chicken breast with a basil and garlic sauce.  There was no basil seasoning in the sauce at all and only a small amount of garlic.  She said the broccoli side tasted spoiled.  It may be better when Coco's goes and the Grand Cafe comes back.  I'll wait and see.\"}
{"text":"After waiting more than twenty minutes for service I walked out today.  I have never walked out of a place before.  This Coco's is an EPIC FAIL!  Skip it.  *It should be gone by May 2011*"}
{"text":"This place is flat out bollocks. I first came in here when I was visiting (in prep for relocation to Vegas). We popped in for breakfast and sat for 20 minutes before the waitress even acknowledged us. She stomped around, avoiding our gaze with a sour look on her face.  Eventually, we told the hostess that we wanted our check, paid for our coffee and juice and left without even ordering.  After we moved to Vegas, we decided to try one more time, giving them the benefit of the doubt -- maybe it was just that waitress. Oddly enough, it was the same hostess and we were sat in the same booth, but a different waitress helped us (Sour Puss was working, though.)  Our waitress was very nice, but seemed extremely frazzled, even though it wasn't that busy.  (though, she did have tables all over the restaurant -- not sure why they don't group the servers' stations more efficiently).  We were greeted right away and she did take our order, but after we sat for 25 minutes, she told us she forgot to put in our order and had just done so 5 minutes ago.  Another 15 minutes went by and I finally told her that if our order wasn't up, we had to go. (It was only two breakfasts, not a party of 10.) She disappeared into the kitchen and NEVER came back out.  About 7 minutes minutes later, the hostess came out and told us our breakfast was free if we wanted to wait (because it was going to take another few minutes to be ready) and that apparently our server didn't remember to put the order in the *second* time.  The food was fine. Nothing to write home about. I got the Denver Potato Pancakes and while the flavor was good, they were a bit oversteamed and mushy in the middle. Eggs were solid. Average food, overall.  No one ever came back to check on us, to bring us a faux bill, to apologize again... nothing. So we finally just got up and left.   I realize they work in a tourist industry and they're betting they won't see most of these people again. With service like this, they're right."}
{"text":"I ordered the Greek feta salad. I was very pleased with how fresh and tasteful it was! Everyone here was very pleasant and helpful when I came in too. All in all a very nice place to eat!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is always good so you'll have a short wait because they're busy. But it'll be worth it! Try anything on the menu it's all good.thwy even have gluten free items and healthy choices!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Tex Mex scramble and on the recommendation of my server the apple carrot muffin, which it turned out they didn't have so I chose the banana nut muffin.  The muffin came out quickly and was decent.  It was at least another 30 minutes until the scramble was brought during which time my drink was refilled once.  After I started eating the scramble, which was mediocre at best, I realize that it was missing at least the sour cream.  Unfortunately the server never returned to request the sour cream or to refill my drink again.  In fact I had to go to the register to get my check.  If all that wasn't bad enough as I left the restaurant there were two employees at the bench just outside the door smoking so I got a nice face full of smoke on the way to my car.  Needless to say that will be the last time I eat at Coco's."}
{"text":"We came here since our original destination had a grease fire and closed for the next hour.  Breakfast sounded kinda good so the BF and I grabbed:  Denver Pancakes- these were okay. They would be better a bit crispier since I like my hash browns crisp.  There was confusion on the ordering though. You can get a la carte and just get the pancakes, a combo which is \"served with two eggs any style and choice of: applewood bacon, sausage links or turkey sausage patty, or you can go deluxe which says \"served with three breakfast meats: applewood bacon, savory ham and sausage links or turkey sausage patty. Only $1 more to upgrade from a combo\". The server asked if I wanted it as a combo. I said no, I want to go deluxe and let me have sunny side and I picked pork sausage links over the turkey patty.   The meal comes out and I have sausage links and denver pancakes. I asked where the other meat and eggs and she goes \"oh thats why I asked if you wanted a combo\"....which I didn't because I want it as a deluxe and either way a combo or a deluxe has eggs and I did say what style of eggs I wanted and it was written down so she goes looks and realizes I did order it. So then she asked what choice of other meat I want for my deluxe and I said, it comes with all of them but then she just sounded really confused like and kept saying its a choice of and was getting frustrated like  I was not ordering right so I just said give me bacon. Choice of- combo, 3 meats deluxe....I don't work there, but I can read that right on the menu. She didn't charge me for the bacon or eggs, but it is still not what I ordered and I don't get why it was hard to get that the deluxe has a little bit of everything. The was the point- I wanted a variety and I didn't get what I sought after. Also she said something about the chef was missing so she apparently cooked it.... (that's kinda weird) the bacon was crispy burnt, the eggs over easy, not sunny side.   BF got corned beef hash which has eggs, home potatoes and then you get a choice of bread or pancakes. He upgraded to red velvet pancakes. It was all pretty okay, but nothing remarkable.   It's not the best breakfast out there, but late night it'll do. I would usually say  that it's a wide variety breakfast platter bang for your buck place, but not tonight. For the fact it was difficult to get something straight forward and on their menu I can't really give more than 2 stars, \"meh I've had better\" on a place that will never really have outstanding food so it really tanks when service isn't there.   She was nice enough....but that isn't enough to make up for the confusion. Just don't order anything \"complicated\" I guess."}
{"text":"This place is near where my kid swims, so we wanted to try this. My 8 year old ordered the turkey sandwich which was perfect. So healthy and yummy for a child. I had the country friend steak which wasn't anything special but I was craving it.   Problems I had were all service. It took FOREVER to even get the lady to show up to take drink orders. When she did, it took her FOREVER to come back to the table. I asked for their beer selection and she said they only have Miller or Bud or something like that. I opted for ice tea that was never refilled. Ugh. I'd try again (no, it wasn't packed) to see if it's better next time."}
