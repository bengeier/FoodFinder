{"text":"In comparison to the food options in Mac Hall (food court at UofC), this place gets 5 stars.  Everything is overpriced on campus, and although this is no exception, it's much better value compared to the other options (especially compared to extreme pita).  There are several halal/kosher options, as well as vegetarian or vegan choices. The food is fresh, or at least was freshly prepared in house and frozen to be cooked when you order it.  They offer you lemon juice and/or hot sauce on everything, and their selection of veggies and sauces is pretty good.    The owner can be pretty grumpy.  Just repeat what you want if he didn't hear you, and don't take it personally if he swears at the veggies."}
{"text":"In the major dining area for UofC, offering a variety of Greek and other foods. Not mind blowing, but the food is cheap and its one of the few worthwhile vegan options on campus. Falafel is pretty good even though the balls are microwaved. Veggies are fresh. They recently updated their counter and ask you for all the veggies you want, and are pretty generous. I always ask for hummus with my falafel wrap and they don't charge extra."}
{"text":"It's so delicious! I ordered a beef donair wrap last night for dinner. It was so yummy so I ordered another to go. Now, beef donair wrap is my lunch again! The ingredients are fresh and the beef was well grilled. Really like this on-campus spot."}
