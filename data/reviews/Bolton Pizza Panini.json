{"text":"I always place takeout orders. Fast, fresh and delicious. And the owner is fantastic! Love supporting local! Highly recommend the chicken parm sandwich with cheese. Mmm! And I hear their catering is amazing as well"}
{"text":"Nice little place near the Galaxy Cinemas to grab a quick bite before a show. We tried delicious panini sandwiches; veal and veggi.  The bread was nice and light, the meat tender and grilled veg was flavourful. Prices are really reasonable and service is quick. Takeout appeared to also be very popular.  Other guests were enjoying wine, coffee and dessert.  We had to run and catch a show, so will try it next time."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Period. Great fried panzos and great veal sandwiches for such a fair price point. The family that owns it is extremely nice and always comes by our table to say hi and chat. I've only been here twice, my girlfriend a lot more, but I am already a customer for the long run. No doubt in my mind."}
{"text":"I thought it was a good pizza. The lady that worked there was so sweet. She insisted I take a menu, She was like a sweet nonna. 

I need to try it again thin crust and well done to give a five star review so STAY TUNED. 

The sauce was actually the best part. I thought it was a very tastey sauce."}
