{"text":"Yum yum yum yum yum yum yum. Yellow curry is so delectable I licked the bottom of the plate. Yum. I don't even know what else to say. They deliver so you can enjoy from your living room. Everything we ordered was delicious. I have been craving more since we ordered last week. A plus."}
{"text":"not the cheapest but the quality is definitively present! i ordered beef basilic thai, very tasty, in large quantity, with on the side a delightfull sticky rice. nothing to say except that all was so fresh and good. i also ordered a soup cause i was ill, and the cherry on the cake, a lady call me to confirm my order and as she knew i was sick thay gave we extra rolls as a gift for a good recovery!! what a kind thought. i never thought things like this happenned again in such a large city. SO i can only state on the delivery but fresh and tasty food in large quantity and the delivery was fast as well. i recommand!"}
{"text":"Taken advantage is how I feel after ordering from this restaurant. Almost 80 dollars worth of food and it could barely feed 3 people. Portions are skimpy and food is ok at best. I wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"Yummy, standard North American Thai food (i.e. your favorites will likely be there) in a nice ambiance with good service. I will eat here again, though I may do take-out instead of dining in.

The details: We came in on a Saturday night for a simple, low-key meal. The place was nearly empty. We were seated immediately, and our server asked us if we had brought wine. Resto is  BYOB, which I hadn't known (my fault for not doing my due diligence), which is a major plus in my book, so I will remember that for next time. We didn't want drinks so we just ordered water, which tasted plasticky, like it had been in a plastic pitcher for a while...This detail is important for later. Our food came out ridiculously quickly--under 10 minutes for 4 main dishes. But considering what we ordered (pad thai=most popular dish; curry=prepared sauce; fried rice= quick), the speed wasn't alarming. Everything was cooked properly and was fresh. We didn't order dessert or coffee. Total bill was reasonable for the dishes. 

Attention: Take the chili pepper symbols (spiciness) on the menu seriously! If you do not like spicy food, be sure to ask what 1/2/3/4 peppers means; otherwise you may find yourself with your mouth on fire, in need of lots water to cool your mouth...and plasticky-tasting water is not ideal for that."}
{"text":"Fabulous Thai restaurant in the Plateau area! Had the vegetarian red curry and chicken Pad Thai and both were excellent. Service was also great! Our server was from France (didn't get her name) and was very knowledgable about the menu and extremely friendly. Good ambiance in the restaurant and quiet which is what we were looking for on this night. Will be back next time I'm in Montreal!"}

Occasion
Mercredi soir, on était la seule table et on était 9 pour fêter un anniversaire. C'est un Apportez votre vin. 

Nourriture
J'ai pris le plat de  1/2 Canard croustillant désossé accompagné de lychee et sauce hoisin épicé sur un lit de laitue. Le plat était bon, mais n'était pas original. C'était 1/2 canard, avec trois litchis sur des carottes émincés et de la laitue verte tranchée, accompagné d'un bol de riz et un bol de sauce hoisin sucré. Il aurait pu avoir un peu de légumes pour accompagner la viande. J'ai apprécié le plat. 

Mes amis ont pris du général tao, poulet sauce aux arachides, plat de crevettes, un plat de boeuf et un pad thai. C'est donc un restaurant asiatique adapté au goût du Québec et non avec des plats traditionnels chinois ou thailandais. Si vous prenez une table d'hôte, cela vient avec une soupe wonton, un rouleau impériaux et un ravioli chinois. Le genre de restaurant que mes parents n'aimeraient pas, mais que mes amis québécois aimeraient :) J'ai été serveur dans un restaurant avec le même type de nourriture sur la Grande Allée à Québec qui était bien adapté aux touristes. 

Loin de moi de vouloir critique la cuisine, mais j'aime mieux des restaurants avec des plats plus traditionnels. 

Ambiance
La salle est quand même sombre avec un éclairage tamisé et de la musique instrumentale. Peut-être une bonne ambiance romantique. 

Service
Service courtois et efficace. 

Il y a beaucoup de commandes pour emporter lorsque nous étions là. 

Prix: 
Avec taxes et pourboires, environ 25-40$ par personne. 

Je n'y retournerai pas, à moins que des amis organisent leur fête là et que je n'ai pas mon mot à dire."}
{"text":"I was surprised by this place I gotta say. It's on Mont Royal, which can be hit or miss, and it has an aquarium and sorta whatever decor, but comfy, and not the cleanest bathrooms in the world, but totally fine, and anyway the gent who picked it had been a chef at the Ritz and it was near the bar we were going to after so why the heck not. 

And as I said, pleasantly surprised. It's a BYO which is always nice, and the service was excellent, she was funny and friendly and had great suggestions on which meats to pair with each curry. I ordered a yellow curry with veg and sticky rice and the flavour was awesome, rich and spicy and sweet and so yummy. Everyone at my table - a group of 7 - seemed to be super happy with their picks and we relaxed and didn't rush and it didn't cost much - under $20 for me and I had a bunch of leftovers. Nice option in the area for sure!"}
{"text":"I only tried this place out because of Risa D's review and I found a coupon on Groupon so decided \"why not?\". There weren't many people there on the Thursday night we went but I over heard the waiter tell another couple that the weekends are completely booked for weeks.
My boyfriend tried the General Tao chicken and I took the Spicy Basil stir fry. I'm not a fan of General Tao chicken but this place??? The chicken is the best I have EVER had. It was SUPER crunchy deep fried chicken with a nice glaze on top.. the glaze was not too sweet or spicy. It was perfect! The basil chicken was EXTREMELY garlicky but very tasty. But not as good as the general tao. I would definitely go back. For the price? and BYOB... totally worth it..."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from here and liked the food so much that I went in to the restaurant. Oh my. 

TLDR; the food is great but the dining experience the exact opposite. 

When we ordered delivery, the food was fantastic. Not too spicy, flavourful and overall an enjoyable experience. We were so eager to then go in especially since it was BYOW and man we were disappointed. The aquarium, the strange blue-tinted lighting and plethora of potted plants contribute to a gloomy atmosphere. No problem though! We were excited for the food! The service was terribly slow and we were shafted into a corner and forgotten. We asked for our curries to  be mild and they came out firey! I think we needed to have emphasized how less we needed the spice level to be. Wish the waitress has made it clear how hot the food would have been! 

Overall my recommendation is get their food delivered or for takeout. The dine-in experience isn't worth it. Enjoy the flavourful thai food and if you don't like the spicy really ensure they know it!"}
{"text":"Ordered the green curry, coconut soup, and general tao tofu. We were very very happy with our meal. The green curry was SO good, we ate every last bit of it. The quality is definitely present here, and I would definitely order from the restaurant again. 

My only complaint is the price - it is fairly steep."}
