{"text":"Let me start by saying I am only ever at Mulberry's for Cleveland Plays sports, I probably would not be here otherwise.  The patio has a great view, but the bar and venue is disgusting.  The whole building smells terrible, bathrooms rarely have toilet paper or paper towels and I've received mixed drinks with fruit flies.  Bartenders are very nice and attentive, that's the main reason I gave them two stars instead of one.  The area is also not safe, make sure to lock your doors, I've had my car broken into while parked outside.  They do have a security guard outside most Cleveland Plays nights."}
{"text":"This random gem has possibly the best pizza I have had in life. We all know pizza is subjective but if you enjoy a thick crusted, highly flavourful pizza like I do, do yourself a favour and get down to this place immediately. The calzones and wings are also top notch. The prices are cheap. We've been here/ordered delievery at least 5-6 times and have yet to have any dislikes. We moved across town and still drive downtown just to come here. If you are into sports, this is an actual sports bar, not a bar that shoves sports in your face via tv, but where you come in shorts and actually play volleyball or whatever team sport is going down. It's fun that you can watch matches through a huge plexiglass view from the bar to the sport arena as well. I can't believe a sports bar offers bar food this delicious. It's almost offensive! Lol! The bartender/manager & cook are also a hoot. Good vibes."}
{"text":"A fun bar in the flats where you can play basketball or other sports. I will never forget playing dodgeball on roller skates, dressed as the hamburgler.   The patio has a beautiful view of the river and its bridges. It's what the flats could be again!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt THE WORST pizza on the planet.  Imagine a pound of salt poured on top of cheap store bought pizza dough.  There is absolutely no sauce and they are using the cheapest government issued cheese and toppings."}
{"text":"Bar service was good, actually.  They have a decent selection of beers although you won't find any Porter, Stout, etc.  The darkest beer is Guinness.  Nice volleyball courts and outdoor patio.   Didn't eat any food."}
{"text":"There are no shortage of pizzas places in town but I wanted to try a place a haven't had yet.    I have to to Mulberry's for basketball and drinks but this was a first for food  The pizza was very solid!  It's a thicker crust style and no shortage on the toppings.  I thought it could have used a little more sauce but still very pleased over all.    I also got a dozed of a buffalo wings was were cooked perfectly.  Again, they could have used a little more sauce but that's just my preference and will know how to order next time.   The bartender/GM Gus, was very helpful and amazing customer service.   I will be back often."}
{"text":"My experience was fantastic. The staff was courteous and inviting. And the food was excellent"}
{"text":"I'll give Mulberrys two stars for an innovative idea.  I like that I can play Volleyball and Kickball year round inside of their gym, but the service and drink prices aren't exactly what I'd expect for a place thats basically empty all the time.   If you don't have that many customers you can pull yourself away from the one guy giving your boobs attention and come give an over priced beer.    I wish they had open gym hours where you could just go and play, but they are basically reserved by Cleveland Plays Non-Stop.  Which is really the only thing keeping Mulberry's open in my opinion."}
{"text":"We went here to watch a volleyball tournament and the court is around mediocre. The bathrooms are sort of trashy, but the bar and the food is probably some of the best I've ever had. Normally I'm not a big fan of bar food, but the food here blew me away, in my honest opinion, I would rather eat the food here then go to a sit-down restaurant. They have large calzones and they are absolutely huge, the pizza is amazing also. I would highly recommend this place for a venue for different sports or also for a quick bite to eat. Hands down some of the best food I've ever eaten. The bar has a huge selection and also the bartender and cook are really nice people"}
{"text":"I come here for indoor volleyball and kickball and it's a great sports complex for those games. They even have a few outdoor volleyball courts. You wouldn't normally think of a sports complex/bar to have a great food but trust me, the food is so good, especially the pizza. I usually don't care for thicker crusts but they balance it so well between a crisper crust but fluffy center. I've even had a delicious korean burger special. The owners are remodeling parts of the bar and really stepping up with the decor and games. I would totally come here on a non-volleyball/kickball day to watch a game and enjoy awesome bar food."}
{"text":"This was a special find!!! So I've been living in Ohio for over 25 years and never really explored as much as I wanted to until a couple of years ago.  One of my friends were craving pizza and another wanted to drink and another wanted to play volleyball.  Well what better place to go to than this place!  The owner was so welcoming when we first came in which made each experience here very pleasant.  Not only are the drinks delicious, but the pizza is to die for!!!!  So far my husband and I have had the meat lovers and the Hawaiian pizza!  Both pizza have been very delicious and I don't usually eat the crust of my pizza but for some reason this place makes each bite so packed with flavor that I can't help but to keep eating.  Have you ever ate so much because the food was so good and end up being uncomfortably full?  Yeah this is definitely what happens to me every time I come here!  Seriously love the food and the sauce he serves the pizza with.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants delicious pizza or an awesome place to drink or just to be active with friends! This place has it all!"}
{"text":"I just had a pepperoni pizza tonight at Mulberry's.  It has great fresh made crust."}
{"text":"We stopped by Mulberry's on a bar crawl and I honestly had to be drug away!   The catered food we had (chicken strips, potato skins, nachos) was great!  The chicken strips were more like entire chicken breasts, but who am I to complain about quantity on a bar crawl!?  Scoff!    The waitress kept us happy and filled our pitchers plus there was an unmanned karaoke machine?  Puhleeze...I'm in heaven!    I've been to Mulberry's maybe once before, but having such a great experience, I might actually show up to cheer on some of my dodgeball/kickball friends in the future!  It's kinda awesome that there is a bar overlooking the playing courts.  Kinda Awesome."}
