{"text":"Make sure and check your bill! I went here a couple weeks ago and had a perfectly fine breakfast. The server brought the check and I checked it and all was fine. Went up front to pay with my card and the hostess ran it through. Screen pops up asking how much to tip, no prob. So when I get home I happen to look at my receipt and it was not my bill of fare. I called over and the hostess had some excuse about how they sometimes call 2 tables the same thing when busy (?) They were really not that busy. She said when I came back in she would just comp me $6 on my ticket.  I told her I really only come there a couple times a year. She seemed a bit put out but said she would figure it out and refund my card exact amount. A week later still no refund so I called back over. Now she was slightly snitty and told me she had done it. I can see from my statement she had not. I realize it was only $6 but it was MY $6! So folks, make sure you are paying for YOUR breakfast when you sign the receipt."}
{"text":"I always enjoy breakfast here, because there is a huge selection. This place packs up quick though and the staff/waitresses are not always A+.   I haven't found myself partial to most of the things on the menu, but I enjoy their baked omelettes, crepes, and hash-browns. It is also worth noting that they do use egg beaters as well which keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Meh.  Three hostesses, and yet they lost our entry on the waiting list.  Everything we ordered felt rushed. Poached eggs medium came with runny whites (ew!).  The hash browns were limp, despite having a brown crust.  Belgian waffle was dense and soggy.  The bacon was decent, and the coffee was respectable.  That's not enough reason to wait an hour and spend $13/plate on mediocre food.  They were once decent - not spectacular, but decent - on past visits, but I've noted a steady decline.  In the unlikely occurrence that I return, I fear next time the rating will be lower."}
{"text":"I have no idea why Pancake Cafe is the #2 breakfast in Madison-- I can think of plenty of places that have MUCH better food and provide a MUCH better experience.   I was there with my partner today and I had the blueberry waffle which cost around $7.  $7 for ONE plain waffle with two tiny scoops of blueberries which were shrivled and presumably defrosted.  I expected blueberries in the batter- nope.  I expected a tasty compote to go on top- nope.  Just wet blueberries. (and only one waffle...)  My partner had the 1-2-3 combo.  His bacon had hardly any meat and was nearly all gummy fat.  He upgraded to get pecan pancakes but what a bust-- we had to send back the first order because there were no pecans in the batter.  When he got a true order of pecan pancakes, they were doughy and visibly not cooked through.  The pecans were also very plain- not toasted.   My advice?  Don't waste your time or your money at this sterile, unattractive restaurant with sub-par food.  We will never go again.  We recommend Marigold, Lazy Jane's, Daisy's Cafe and Cupcakery, and Bradbury's for excellent breakfasts.  All have interesting atmospheres, better prices for what you get, quality staff (our server was a teenager with her sports bra hanging out of her shirt.  I shouldn't judge but it looked trashy) and most importantly- fresh, delicious food.  If a \"zero\" star rating were an option, Pancake Cafe would get it from me."}
{"text":"Order an omelet, get a side of pancakes.  I love it.  We go hear often when family is visiting from out of town because after taking them here once, they are hooked and want to go back every time.  It is a popular place and even though they have added a lot of space, you might have to wait during prime weekend brunch hours.  Usually its not too long though.  The specialty baked pancakes are really good and kind of fun.  And huge."}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed, especially for a Thursday at noon.  First, the waitress... it wasn't crowded at all, but it took her a good 10 minutes to bring his coffee and my tomato juice and take our order.  Once the food came, she waited the requisite 5 minutes, came to ask how everything was, then completely disappeared until she brought the check.  The food was... okay.  First, it was lukewarm by the time it got to the table, which I certainly didn't expect since they weren't busy.  I had the spinach crepes, which supposedly contain \"fresh spinach tossed with aged cheddar cheese sauce...topped with hollandaise sauce.\"  Aged?  No.  Cheddar cheese sauce?  From a can, maybe. Hollandaise?  Yes, but not much.  Also, the crepe batter was overly eggy and had a sweet taste that would have been better suited to the fruit or chocolate crepes.  Savory crepe dishes need a savory crepe - or, at least one that's not sweet.  The flavor combination was a little strange.  However, the dish came with 3 potato pancakes, which for $7.29 made it a good, filling value.  My husband's Belgian waffle, on the other hand, while quite yummy, was not worth $6.00, considering it didn't actually come with anything other than butter or syrup.  Maybe it's because I'm used to smaller-town establishments, but at $6.00 for one waffle, it should at least come with a link of sausage or two.  Speaking of breakfast meat, you can order it as a side.  But at $4.79 for a hamburger-sized patty of not-very-flavorful corned beef hash and $4.29 for three slices of thick-cut (yet tough and chewy) bacon, you may want to skip it.  A Belgian waffle and a side of bacon should not come to over $10.00.  I'm not ready to write this place off yet - I'll give it another chance, because I've heard such good things about it.  I'd love to see if maybe I just ordered the wrong thing."}
{"text":"I had eaten at this restaurant before and I remember having an ok, but not great experience.  It seems to be a favorite of many people so I figured the Groupon offer would be a good reason to give it another shot.  This will be my last visit to this restaurant.  I had a similar experience as another reviewer when trying to make the reservation to use the Groupon.  I called on a Sunday at several different times hoping to get a reservation, but I got no answer.  I also left a message on the answering machine, but still never got a call back.  I did call on a different day and got an answer right away and was able to make the reservation.  I went on a Sunday in the early afternoon.  We were seated almost immediately.  I was disappointed that there was no kids activities.  I have started to take for granted that there will at least be crayons and coloring page for my kids.  Fortunately, my kids are a little older now and pretty well behaved so they could amuse themselves.  One of the coffee mugs was dirty.  It took a while for the waitress to come back and get us a replacement.  All six of us ordered pancakes, but when our food arrived, the waitress only had a small amount of butter for all of us to share.  We had to request more.  The spinach omelette was ok, but the mushroom sauce looked like someone opened a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup and put it in a bowl.  By the time the butter arrived, my pancakes were barely warm enough to melt butter.  They did not taste very good either.  My only consolation is that I was using the Groupon so I did not pay full price for the food.  I felt bad for the people I had invited to join us for breakfast because they ended up paying for food they did not enjoy.  I still do not understand how this place is voted a Madison favorite.  I will stick to the Original House of Pancakes from now on."}
{"text":"I didn't like the first dish I tried, but the second time I ordered chocolate crepes. My order came with three big crepes, full of chocolate and garnished with strawberry slices. Two thumbs way up."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst breakfast I've ever had. The pancakes are leathery and tasteless. I ordered blueberry pancakes and I was able to dig out 2 blueberries per pancake. The scrambled eggs were awful, they didn't even taste like eggs and were bland like the rest of the food. My husband's corned beef hash was so salty he could barely eat it. The hash browns were ok. Overall, I would not go back because the quality of food is mediocre for the price."}
{"text":"Today, my girlfriend and I went here for brunch for what will undoubtedly be the last time.  We received what can only be called unrepentantly bad service.  After putting our name in, a half hour went by before a manager asked if we were waiting, apparently we had been forgotten.  Once we were seated, our waiter took our order and delivered our mimosas.  However, the only remaining times he would stop over would be to ask if we needed more water.  Afterward, he neglected to actually bring any water until at least 10 minutes after we had asked for some, far after we were done with our food.  Speaking of food, a significant portion of my order was burnt the point of being inedible.  Our second round of mimosas came in dirty glasses.  There really was nothing redeemable about this experience."}
{"text":"Ate here after looking for a breakfast place around Madison. It was in a strip mall but sometimes location doesn't matter for a good meal. This was NOT the case here. From the second we walked in and saw the FILTHY carpeting plus  the the two female hostesses with long, stringy hair and dirty clothes, we should have walked out. We stayed unfortunately and the waiter was dismal and rude. We wanted to order right away but he said, \"No, i will get you drink order first.\" When we all just wanted water, he still refused to take our food order. After bringing us the water, then he took the order. Never experienced that ever before in a restaurant. Usually the wait staff cheerfully says, \"Oh you're all ready, sure, I can take your order.\" Not this guy.The pancakes were tasteless and horrible. I kept asking myself, why didn't we turn around and walk out immediately? We all had pancakes and I ordered blueberry and he told me they were fresh. These were \"fresh\" out of the freezer pack they came in. UGH - the food was not good. The place was dirty - sticky tables, filthy carpeting, sent back silverware that was dirty - the other location is supposed to be good in Fitchburg but please do yourself a favor and avoid this place. If you think the pancakes are good here, you have never had a good pancake!"}
{"text":"I went to the Pancake Cafe this morning(Sat) for a group breakfast (11 people). Facility--A+ Cleanliness--A Hostess---A Service--C- Food--C+ Value--C-  Prices about 25% higher than scale for Madison Overall Experience--B  The only thing I didn't like there was that they add an automatic 20% surcharge as they do not trust people to leave a TIP on their own--I find this off-putting   The staff seemed very friendly but our server clearly had too many tops and did not have the time needed to even refill one cup of coffee."}
{"text":"I have been to Pancake cafe many, many times over the years.  I have always been satisfied with the food, but the service is very hit or miss.  I had a bad experience there on the morning on 5/5/14.  Our waiter was extremely inattentive.  He walked away after taking only 2 drink orders from our table of 3 people, forgot to bring out the butter or syrup, then seemed very short when I reminded him of it.  It took forever to get our check or a to-go box and he admitted he had completely forgotten about us.  It was a Monday at 11am and there was a maximum of 6 tables in the entire restaurant!  He then proceeded to tell us how he would rather be getting drunk that day.  It was so unprofessional.  Despite this, and probably against my better judgement, as we were leaving I made reservations for the Mother's Day brunch (I wrote a separate review for that, which was also a disaster).  I gave my name for the reservation, and our waiter said he liked my name.  I said \"Thank you\". And then he responded that \"He didn't mean it like that, he was married\".  What?!  I was thanking him for a compliment!  Again, so awkward, uncomfortable, and unprofessional!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had breakfast here a few weeks ago.  The restaurant is clean and new.  No one was around to greet us and several patrons stood around waiting.  Once seated the service was OK at best.  The food was not edible.  I ordered pancakes, eggs, sausage with a side of white toast.  The eggs were runny, the sausage was not cooked through, the toast was not toasted at all.  With a name like the \"Pancake Cafe\" you would think that they would have real maple syrup, but \"NO\" the syrup tasted like sugar water w/ food coloring.  My husband meal was OK, but nothing to rave about. We live relatively close to this place and looked forward to a nice family place to have breakfast, but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've eaten in a few times and had very mixed experiences.  On a weeknight we have had great food and great service and the same on a weekend.  However we have also had the polar opposite.  At it's best we were seated quickly and had an attentive and happy server, but we had two different experiences where despite calling ahead, our name was missed on the list, the host/manager/server were rude and neglectful and the food was lukewarm and lacking flavor.    I wish I could agree with the number of positive reviews but every time I have gone back expecting a different experience, the difference has been marginal.    I would recommend taking the 15 minute drive downtown to any number of great breakfast or brunch options.  Your food and experience with be much more consistent and unique to Madison."}
{"text":"Great selection of tasty breakfast items including some unique creations, plus good coffee.  I especially like the omelettes, cinnamon rolls, and buckwheat pancakes.   Friendly servers.  Gets very busy on the weekends, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Used to be better. Bad service now, resulting in cold food and no refills. Also, the bus boy parked a very dirty and reeking cart right next to us while he cleaned the adjacent table. After telling all this to the staff while paying (10-minute wait in line just to pay), they said they were sorry - that's it. I'll probably go somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"Talk about amazingly large portions. I probably could have used 3 hours to try and finished the food. And when we ordered coffee we got full mugs and the thermos.   The table placement could be rearranged a little to be more cozy and less open space but overall it is a great place to eat a large breakfast with friends."}
{"text":"Never a miss at Pancake Cafe! Great food, great service ... a family tradition and worth any wait you may encounter.  My guilty pleasure is the BLT, extra crispy bacon and extra mayo on the side.   I also appreciate the REAL cream they offer for your coffee. None of that sketchy oily based \"creamer.\"   Make this part of your weekend family tradition ... they won't disappoint.   Now I am hungry!!!!"}
{"text":"Love Pancake Cafe! Would go more if it weren't for a long wait on most Saturday and Sunday mornings, but it's definitely worth it when we do. I've never had a bad meal, but my fall back and absolute favorite is the strawberry waffle. The bacon is great, the fruit is great, omelettes too. I've never been there for lunch, but have heard great things about their portabella sandwich and various other lunch items. Service tends to vary, but the food generally makes up for it."}
{"text":"Food was OK,  not great but fair.  One person in our party had one of the fruit crepes and that was good. I had the Swedish Pancakes which weren't very good. Another had the Eggs Benedict and that was OK. Someone else tried a spinach crepe which was fair.  Bacon and Sausage were both good and the wait staff was very pleasant."}
{"text":"I have been regularly eating breakfast for the last month at this Pancake Cafe location, after having such a terrible experience at the West Side (Madison) location. I like to come because I have a Gluten food allergy, known as Celiacs disease. They offer their pancakes with an option to be \"Certified Gluten Free\", as printed on their menu. Now when I read \"Certified Gluten Free\", I still make sure to let the server know multiple times throughout my order that they need to cook the food in a separate area then where other regular pancakes are cooked, and they are never slow to tell me it won't be a problem..  Well between yesterday and today I have had the two most UN-Gluten Free meals that I have had in well over a year. I could not tell you what they did wrong in the kitchen, or maybe they just disregarded my instructions completely and took my concern as a joke. But I have NEVER been sicker from a meal \"Certified\" to be gluten free. I am VERY disappointed, and actually still am sick while I am writing this review. Tried going into work after breakfast as I had planned, and wasn't able to continue my day. Quite honestly am considering talking to my lawyer to ask the legality of PCC putting \"Certified Gluten Free\" on the menu, when it most certainly is not. Outside of the actual food, the host staff has always been great and very organized, and most of the time the wait staff has been great as well!  BUT or anyone who is medically Gluten Free or has any other food allergy for a matter of fact, I highly suggest to STAY AWAY!  I can without question say that today was my last time I will be eating my breakfast at Pancake Cafe, unless they can seriously get their act together in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Meh.  I've eaten in here a handful of times and more recently pick up take-out, as it opens early and trying to eat in public with a toddler is usually a disaster.  We live in Fitchburg, and it is one of the few breakfast options.  Every time I get their food, I wish I had just cooked at home.  The pancakes are uninspired.  The fresh strawberries topping them weren't very appealing, and even my toddler cast some of them aside saying \"Yucky.\"  The spinach mushroom crepes were soupy and bland.  I'm not expecting potato pancakes to be on par with those of my polish grandmother's, but these were hardly worth eating.  The best part of my meal this morning was a sausage patty, which I unfortunately paid $3 for.  Drive the extra miles and go to OPH.  I have never left there without a full belly and a smile."}
{"text":"This place is better than the exterior & decor would lead you to believe...it's in need of a makeover. We had the baked banana & pecan pancake, which was DELICIOUS! It was loaded with nuts and a caramelized sauce...worth the wait. They also gave us our own pot of coffee at the table, and the creamer is fresh in its own little pot (alas, no flavored creamers, though). I tried the hash browns, which were cooked to the perfect level of crispness. A good find while on the road!"}
{"text":"I ate that the pancake cafe in fitchburg about 5 years back and a very good experience. Today, I decided to try out this location. First thing I noticed is that there was great parking and the place was half empty. Next, walking in, the place looks tattered and run down. The greeting from the hostess was half-ass and as depressing as the atmosphere. Here is a list of the following that ensued: 1. The original waitress took our order wrong. 2. 5 minutes later, a new waitress comes out to clarify our oder. 3. 25 minutes later, we get out food. In that time our waitress checked on 0 times. 4. The food was mediocre at best. The cinnamon bun looked like a five cent dried biscuit with pasty cream and nasty cinnamon sauce - AND THEY BROUGHT IT OUT COLD!!!! 5. I had to remind them to bring out the following - my milk, English muffin, and cinnamon bun. 6. Waitress checked one us 1 time throughout the entire meal, and took 20 minutes to bring us the check.  This place needs new management or needs to go out of business ASAP!  One redeeming quality (and I mean the ONLY one) - they have FANTASTIC fresh squeezed OJ.  Recommendation - pick up some OJ to go and GTFO quickly!!!"}
{"text":"Pancake cafe has just about the best omelettes I've ever had.  Light & fluffy, with very flavorful vegetables and the right balance of cheese.  I also tried the sausage patty and it was delicious.  Fresh squeezed OJ, good ambience all around.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I usually visit the Fitchburg location however ended up visiting this location instead today. I ordered a 1-2-3 with bacon, eggs and pumpkin spice pancakes. As I started eating my pancakes something tasted very sour. My friend also ordered pumpkin pancakes and noticed hers were sour as well. After waiting forever to find our waitress, we flagged her down and let her know that something was wrong with our pancakes. She said she would \"take money off\" of our bills and was rushing to take the nasty sour pancakes back to the kitchen. My friend and I were obviously still hungry so we asked if we could have different pancakes (not the pumpkin ones). She took our new order and her supervisor came over to our table and said she would take some money off of our bill. The waitress then came back and said they had \"changed the recipe\" instead of apologizing. I had these exact same pancakes less than a week ago at their other location and they certainly didn't taste sour, so no, you didn't change the recipe, you basically served us rotten food and tried to pass it as a recipe change. Then we get our bill and the \"manager\" only took two dollars off of our bill. So, you not only served us rotten food, you also argued that it was a \"change in the recipe\", then had an attitude when we asked for a different pancake and proceeded to only take $2 off of our bills and not apologize? Never will I ever go back to this raggedy run down location. I'll stick with Fitchburg."}
{"text":"Love this place, but it gets pretty packed and slow on the weekends.  Their fresh-squeezed orange juice is wonderful (even though I don't drink much orange juice, I love theirs).  And the thick-cut bacon is really good.  I've never been disappointed with my food, just with how busy they can get on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Great food at typical Madison prices. The weekends are crazy and you can expect a wait, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Loved their waffles and kona coffee. Service was awesome."}
{"text":"We had purchased a Groupon to Pancake Cafe for my parents as a gift. They live 60 miles from Pancake Cafe, so we planned a day when we all could go and enjoy a great breakfast, with my parents using their Groupon. We followed the directions on the Groupon print-out, calling to make reservations. When I called, I got an answering machine stating the hours of operation. There was another number on the print-out in which I called and got nothing. We did our homework, didn't get an answer, so we drove to Fitchburg anxiously waiting a good breakfast.  When we got to PC, there was a note on the door and a sign when you first walk in, informing customers that reservations are needed for Groupon. I worked in the restaurant business for 8 years, as an assistant manager, so customer service is extremely important to me. When I put our parties name down with the hostess, I asked to speak to the owner. The owner came out within a few minutes, wearing a t-shirt and windpants! Who does this? My first thought was \"UNPROFESSIONAL!\" Then I thought that maybe he was at the store, just working on bookwork with no intentions working with customers. Nope, I was wrong! He was out in the dinning room working with customers in his t-shirt and windpants! Very unprofessional! I told him that I called and got an answering machine with one number and nothing with the other. He kept saying over and over, that its policy that a reservation is needed. He also said that he has never had a customer call and not get an answer. He said, \"we are really busy today. There was probably someone on the line making a reservation when you called. Usually people call back if they don't get an answer.\" How many times am I supposed to call back? I told him the stystem was not user friendly and that if an a customer was to get the answering machine that they should put on there that \"if you are calling for a reservation for Groupon, please hang up and try agian as we are on the other line making reservations.\" or something similar to that. I thought at one time during our convo, he was going to honor the Groupon, but he didn't. I was very disappointed that my parents couldn't use their Groupn, but they drove all that way, so we stayed.   After we got seated, it took 7-10 minutes before a waitress/waiter said one word to us. My dad had to get up and tell the hostess that people who got their tables around us after us already had a waitress.  BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE ALL AROUND! After our waitress greeted us, we were ready to order and got our food in a timley manner. Now we have to go back one more time to use our Groupon--not sure I'll be back after that. Customer service is important to me!"}
{"text":"I came with high expectations - and I left with a bad taste in my mouth.  I should start off by saying I am on gluten-free diet, not by choice. It took me 3 tries to finally get an answer as to what the GF pancakes are made of - and thankfully, on the third try, the wait person came out with the bag of GF flour that they use. They had said that there are no nuts in the GF pancakes, however, the GF flour that they use has almond flour in it. So, if you allergic to nuts - do not eat the GF pancakes!  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and my partner, who is not GF,  ordered the pecan waffles. I asked for ketchup - and out came this very generic brand. Call me a snob, but anything that is not Heinz will just not do. Heinz ketchup is really the only palatable ketchup that there is, and it is very delicious at that. I was enjoying my Huevos, until just about towards the end, I was getting a couple bites that tasted really off - like maybe the salsa was really old and past its due date. The hash browns are nothing to write home about. My partner's waffles were on the small side for what they charge. He thought they were delicious, but today, he is paying the price dearly, with a touch of food poison. We're not sure if it's because of the Pancake Cafe, but it is a strong coincidence.  The decor is very outdated, with old shabby carpeting. Service, however, was very good. We didn't wait too long for our table and food, and wait staff and hostess were very friendly.   I feel, however, like emphasis is not placed too highly on the quality of food that they serve - although, if you do want quality food here and you are not allergic to nuts, I would order the GF items. They use an excellent brand of GF flour."}
{"text":"Sooo... Pretty much one of the most fantastic places in fitchburg and I love it. Bacon Pancakes? Umm yes please. They have every type of breakfast food under the sun. Omlets and Pancakes, to Crepes O Chocolat. You can build your own or get something standard. It's in kind of in a hidden area so you gotta know where it is. Furthermore this place does get pretty busy for sunday brunch or brunch in general. The staff is SUPER fast (if your there at a good time and not when church lets out) and everyone just seems to have a blast when they're there. I love this little hidden Gem and everyone should go and enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I love that this is a local joint when so many breakfast places are not. We got their Apple pancake to share at the table and it was definitely more like a dessert. Should of added the ice cream! I also got the bacon pancakes and loved them! I was worried the bacon wouldn't be crispy enough but it definitely was. I was stuffed when I left! Would definitely recommend if your on that side of town."}
{"text":"Really a 3.75 stars.   Solid place to eat breakfast. Especially if you like the \"all-American\" type thing, but don't want to go to IHOP (this is better).  Environment: large tables and area, with additional sections. Lots of families, pre and post church, and the twenty somethings after their Gold gym workout.  Food: We've just about eaten everything here, but my fav is the sausage and egg combo (4 turkey sausage links, 2 poached eggs, hashbrowns vs fruit, and 3 small pancakes as the bread option). It runs me about $9, but it's a little bit of everything I crave: salt, sweet, mushy, crunchy. I like to roll my sausage into the pancakes and poke my yolk over the hash browns. The pancakes are dense yet fluffy; they pull apart. And the hashbrowns are usually the right kind of mushy insides with a crunchy exterior, and a flavor of medium salt seasoning (not from me).   The Swedish pancake is HUGE and skinny (not crepe skinny though) and the come with lingonberry jam - with is like a cranberry jam. It's fun and not too different from my American pancake taste, but I usually spend more money to make the rest work (adding hash browns, eggs and meat).   The chicken and waffle is boring, with the chicken being a \"strip.\" The Huevos Rancheros is mushier than other places, to me. The omelettes are baked. They are poofy, airy, and large. Not my kind of omelette. They add cheese, but it's a texture thing for me with this style of egg. If you like this, they are FILLED with the chosen ingredients. The apple pancake is LARGE for us two ladies. It's like a pie and a danish had a huge baby. It's good but too sweet as a stand alone dish.  The other favorite dish is the MONTE CRISTO. It has everything I love. Salt and sweet in every bite. It's worth the lactaid pill to me. Gooey cheese, turkey (comes with ham too), between french toast, sprinkled with powdered sugar and syrup on the side, with french fries. Technically it's lunch, but for us, it's brunch in the form of one item! Have I had better M.Cs? yes, but can you really go wrong here? No.  They can do Gluten-free and deal with dietary restrictions, somewhat.  Problems: They never seem to have enough staff. The water glass is hardly filled, the coffee comes out slow, the food can be luke warm, and even if you are seated quickly they find a way to suck about 1-2 hours out of your day somewhere.   Overall, I like it and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Probably the best omelette in town but the rest of the food sucks terribly.. it has a warehouse appeal with a diner feel."}
{"text":"I can't remember the food because I was so appalled by the sheer awfulness of the interior.   If the proprietors were aiming to let you experience the look and feel of a contractor's office in a double-wide trailer, they've succeeded. It's an interior that says \"I did it myself.\"   I'd rather stay home and eat in the garage.  That all said, the food is not bad. But we will not set foot in that horror show again."}
{"text":"Not bad for a breakfast place.  We had a large group of 10, and they easily accomodated us and did not care when we grabbed two more chairs off a nearby table when two more showed up.  I thought a few of their menu items were definitely original, such as the bacon stuffed waffles and some of their crepes.  I ordered the banana crepes and left stuffed and satisfied.  It was definitely enough food.  The price was about what you'd expect to pay- I'm trying to find a cheaper breakfast place that serves good food.  The service was a little slow.  We probably waited at least 30 minutes if not more for our food.  I was confused on payment- if you pay in cash, you have to pay up front and that was not explained when we got our checks.  Overall, I would try this place again."}
{"text":"Pretty dissapointing experience. Pancakes tastes super dry, service slow, cheap atmosphere, I honestly would rather go to Perkin's or Denny's. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Who would go to a pancake house for pizza?  This was the very best pizza I've had in a long time.  Starting with the crust, down to the hand cut pepperoni.    The crust was light and had great flavor, the sauce perfect, the veggies cut so it looked like a work of art.  Fresh veggies ~ red and green pepper and fresh mushrooms.  I've had breakfast here before, which was very good.  The pizza far surpassed my expectations."}
{"text":"Omelettes were better than their pancakes which is disappointing to me when they are called the \"Pancake Cafe\" :( I got the pumpkin pancakes with my veggie omelette and I was let down on the lack of pumpkin in my pancake.... I also was not a fan of the home fries."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and each time the food has been pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but pretty good. Here are my pros and cons:  Pros:  -the egg dishes are quite good, and you can get pancakes instead of toast, so it's a win-win -they give you a whole pot when you order coffee, and the coffee is decent. They also give you real cream, no fake creamer stuff. -big space, so you never have to wait crazy long to be seated, even when it's quite crowded -I've never had bad service here. In fact, when I last went, they have me a large baked apple pancake rather than a small because they claimed I had waited too long for it (I hadn't even noticed!).   Cons: -they must be renovating, and the last two times I've been there I've been seated in these weird rooms that feel like half-finished meeting rooms in a hotel...they need to take care of that because it definitely takes away from the potential coziness of the place. -a side of bacon is almost $4. It's yummy bacon, but nonetheless."}
{"text":"I showed up at the Pancake Cafe for a late brunch on a Saturday at 2:30 PM. There were a few people eating in the dining room. I stood in the lobby for about 7 min and was not helped or seated. Within this whole time, I did not see a single employee. I ended up leaving and going somewhere else.  I do want to try the Pancake Cafe sometime, so I plan on going back. I hope I can update my review with a more positive experience after that. :)"}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere is great. Clean and open area. People who are happy to serve you...  ...but when it comes to the food, it's simply bad. And the prices are simply unreasonable. $6 for three strips of bacon? I can buy a pack of the same bacon for $5 just around the corner, which is probably where they buy it.  We had an exploration of their pancakes, gluten-free and gluten-ful, and none of them were all that spectacular. And the gluten-free pancakes were not worth the extra money.  I would suggest you skip this place."}
{"text":"We found ourselves as guests at this pancake house.  It's a clean, bright restaurant and we had a cheerful, prompt and super attentive server.  The eggs and hash browns were just OK. Very nice bacon!   That said, there are about 10 better places in the Madison area to have a great breakfast.   Since the restaurant's name includes the word \"pancake\" I would expect them to be perfectly prepared.  Instead, my pancakes (and those of my partner) were very dry, tasteless,  tough and difficult to cut with even a knife.  The \"maple syrup\" tasted like an artificially flavored high fructose corn syrup.   Way overpriced for what you get!!!"}
{"text":"Pancake Cafe is a good and decent place for breakfast/brunch in the SW part of town. The prices and portions are very good.  My favorite is the veggie omelet with havarti cheese. I don't think I've ever been offered havarti as a cheese choice before! it is yummy and HUGE!  As others have stated, there can be very long waits on the weekends.  Also, kids eat free for dinner on Saturdays!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been here in a while, so we decided to make a trip into Fitchburg one Sunday morning to pay Pancake Cafe a visit.  We were surprisingly seated promptly, but unfortunately had to wait nearly 10 minutes for a waiter to come greet us.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy, my husband ordered the southwest omelet, and my daughter ordered the chocolate chip Mickey pancake.  Our food came promptly and was good.  We didn't see our waiter until after we were finished eating so even if there had been a problem it wouldn't have mattered.  It wasn't overly busy so I am not sure why there was such a lack of service.  Overall it is a good place but the service is definitely lacking.  It is a little expensive for what it is in my opinion.  Our bill was $36 which is expensive for breakfast."}
{"text":"Really solid place to stop for breakfast.   Their menu is a little larger than necessary, however you can really satisfy any craving that you want..so it's hard to complain. A large menu does make it a little difficult to settle on what you want to eat though.   Service was just fine. Our server was chill and played with us a little bit.   The place seemed clean and simply decorated.   There isn't much to say about this place. It's a very good, consistent breakfast, without all that corporate Dennys/IHOP bullcrap."}
{"text":"I ordered the huevos rancheros. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the corn tortillas added nice flavor. However I asked for light amount of cheese and they were coated with cheese. Also the hashbrowns that came with it were not cooked all the way.  Of all the places in Madison that I've been, our service here was the worst. She was not attentive, friendly, or efficient. We had to repeat our order to her because she didn't write it down. We asked for refills on drinks and she said she would be right back but bussed off all of her tables first even though we were the only ones in the place. We had to wait twenty minutes after we finished our meal just to be asked for the check."}
{"text":"fantastic glutenfree pancakes , my nephew has celiacs and was so happy to be able to order pancakes at breakfast. great food great service good prices"}
{"text":"Our waiter was Aaron, great server. Friendly and checked us on the perfect amount of time. Food came out in just enough time and their fressh squeezed orange juice sure tastes fresh."}
{"text":"The food is good... we used to go almost every Saturday but then the waitress started to recognize us and make weird comments and it creeped me out. The decor leaves something to be desired... I've seen more style in a Perkins. So depressing. But if those things don't matter to you, it's decent food for a decent price. But we won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Nice Breakfast place on the west side of town!  Recommend the apple baked pancake!  Totally worth the wait! :-)"}
{"text":"Is the food the worst there is? No.   Is the food worth nearly $10 a plate? NOOOOO.   For the money I spent there I could have gotten so many better meals across the city that would have been much much more worth it.   In the end it's not worth the price for the food you get, if they were $5 plates, it would be a different story."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  You get a whole pot of coffee when you order coffee that stays hot throughout your meal.  The portions are huge and fresh.  We got a fruit medley that was amazingly good and fresh.  The omelettes are baked and arrive nice and fluffy at your table. I like this location on Gammon Rd., it is more convenient for me.  They are also open all afternoon and evening so you can get breakfast until 9 pm.  They place is nice and clean if a little sparse, but the tables are also not squeezed in, so you don't feel overly crowded."}
{"text":"The food was fine and we got plenty of it, but I didn't really feel comfortable - We got a weird vibe from the staff."}
{"text":"As my fellow reviewers have written, the food here is decent and okay, not spectacular. This is a breakfast place that many families like to visit, another point some of the reviewers have made. The management likes to keep the tables served and turned over as they try to accommodate their customers. This would be commendable except for the fact that getting the table and booths clean. The table looked like it had had a cursory swipe with a rag, nothing more, as the previous diner's leavings were stuck on the table (no idea how old it was). You know how your kid likes to stand in the booth while eating and drooling? Well, we saw one little cherubs sticky marks left on the wood around the padded area of the booth that had probably been there for awhile. Being winter with the amount of sickness going around, I would not want to subject anyone with a fragile immune system to a partially cleaned booth. The service is exceptional, as well as the food being decent."}
{"text":"Was super excited for pancakes, but had a horrible experience. All the servers we interacted with seemed out of it or just like they didn't care much. Our order came quite late, but I'm going to assume that's because we ordered an oven baked pancake. I wish they would have told us it'd take an hour though.   The bacon is good, I'll say that. Thick and juicy. But their pecan baked pancake had unmelted sugar, which made it grainy, and the pecans were raw, not baked or carmelized. For a 10 dollar pancake this was so dissappointing.  Our server did not tell us refills on milk and orange juice charged another 3 something dollars, and offered us more like it was free. That was really frustrating. We could have gotten another dish with that money.  We tried the place despite some other bad reviews. Super dissappointed. :/"}
{"text":"Went there with a group late morning (about 10) on a weekday - so I can't comment on how crowded it gets on the weekends or anything.  My sister and nieces think this is the best place since the birth of Christ.  It's definitely wayyyy better than Denny's or Perko's or places of that ilk. It's not too small, enough tables to handle a busy weekend morning.  We were seated right next to the fireplace, which would be cozy in the winter (it wasn't on in July). My son noticed you can get half orders on pancakes and such, which is great, since the amount of food is otherwise obscene. I was supposed to share my Eggs Benedict with my husband because I wanted some of his Cherry Pancakes.  When it all came I took a bite of his and stuck with my eggs, they were great.  The pancakes just had a bit of cherry in the middle and you had to amp it up with syrup.  I was envisioning loads of cherry compote.  No. Good coffee and they left the thermal pitcher so you didn't have to flag them down for refills. One of us ordered strawberries and cream which looked heavenly and was gone in about 30 seconds (and NO sharing on that bad boy). The bacon is super-thick sliced, so there's really something to sink your teeth in to.  We ordered an extra side.  Unfortunately, there are three pieces to a side.  There were four of us.  Rock-paper-scissors never took on such significance. If I lived within 1000 miles, I would go back."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and to go. The restaurant is clean and has friendly staff. However, the food is not worth the prices they charge.   The last time we had to go, I had the spinach hollandaise crepes. The crepes tasted fine, but they barely put any hollandaise sauce on. There might have been a teaspoon for two crepes. The spinach on the insides looked brown and tasted old or frozen. We also ordered a side of sausage. We were charged $4.00 for 1 patty...that's ridiculous!    The strawberry pancakes were the only saving grace. There was a nice helping of fresh strawberries, but the pancakes were nothing special. I can make better pancakes at home.   Save your money and go to the Original Pancake House. You'll thank me for it."}
{"text":"They have GLUTEN FREE PANCAKES! !! Need I say more?? Absolutely delicious. I love this place :)"}
{"text":"This is the place to be for breakfast in Fitchburg.  They have an extreme variety of pancakes...might take a bit to narrow it down.  The coffee is great and the fresh squeezed OJ is a nice treat.  Contrary to other reviews, the hashbrowns  are great! Crispy without being greasy.  Only con is that on weekend mornings the wait can be a bit much."}
{"text":"This was the closest breakfast place close to us, so we came here out of convenience. The menu is nothing special, just your standard breakfast dishes. I found the prices to be a little higher at $9-$10 for a standard breakfast. I ordered the eggs and hash browns with wheat toast. The food is about average diner food--greasy yet tasty. The service was on slower side and the restaurant decor could use some improvement, but overall not bad."}
{"text":"I don't get the rave reviews for this place.  The food was eh, service was slow, the wait was long and the it's expensive.  Why are pancakes so expensive?  8 bucks, really?"}
{"text":"The food is great and the service is also great.  It is abit pricey but I think it is worth it."}
{"text":"We waited for 30 minutes for a table and while that's expected when a restaurant is busy, waiting an hour for subpar food to come out is absolutely absurd. The pancakes were dry, the eggs were flavorless, and the mimosas were flat. Will never return nor recommend to anyone. Waitress never checked in to tell us what was taking so long for the food and then waited until we were almost done to see how everything was."}
{"text":"Standard breakfast establishment. I mean, it's pretty hard to screw up most breakfast foods. Nothing special here. They do serve some cocktails which was a pleasant surprise but the Bloody Mary wasn't really worth it. I suppose this would be a decent place for a family but with many other delicious breakfast options, take a hard pass."}
{"text":"The Kona coffee is a personal favorite for my coffee for my hubby.  We love the banana crepes and Monte Cristo.  I also love the Chicken strip salad!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service!  Accommodated our large party and made sure we had what we needed. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Overall it's just another joint.  I have no problem getting breakfast here, but people seriously overrate the experience and the food quality.  The fact that it becomes a circus on weekend mornings doesn't help things.  The last time I went, the wait staff were completely overwhelmed.  Result: slow, hectic service.  People sitting all over the entry way, or just standing around waiting for seating.  Not a good way to spend a relaxing Saturday or Sunday morning.  There is nothing particularly wrong with the food, but let's inject a little reality into the hype.  It is nothing special.  A few items are yummy but then again, most breakfast restaurants have a specialty or two with some wow-factor happening.  Yes, I will probably return because there are few breakfast options like it in Fitchburg.  If there was, though, I would choose to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My wife and I love to come here on our way to Madison. It's our favorite breakfast place! We have never had lunch here before but out of all the times we have been here we have never been disappointed. The serving sizes are big, the food is tasty, tasty, the staff is courteous I recommend that you give them a try!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very cute. The hostess appeared to be preoccupied so we had to emphasize we wanted a both and show her an open one.  The menu is extensive but I wanted a waffle meal and it had to be ordered a la cart which equalled over $15 because of the $5.99 3 pieces of bacon! Booooo! The bacon was good but greasy.  My pecan waffle tasted very good until I put the house made watery maple syrup.  Then it became a soggy cake with pecans.  :-(   A staff member who appeared to be manager, because she did not introduce herself, asked how the food was. She has started to walk away before I was able to finish saying the food was \"disappointing.\"  She then came back and I told why I was disappointed and she apologized very nicely. But did not offer any compensation.  I do need to add my her food thought her food was better.  Overall I would recommend this place unless you did not have any place else to go. If you eat here I suggest ordering a combo instead of a la cart and getting food that does not require syrup.  This place has been voted \"Best in Madison\" for years,  o honestly wonder why but maybe I came on a bad day?"}
{"text":"They are great! I really like this place. The customer service is superb. Our waiter was knowledgable and funny. He gave us exactly what we ordered. The food was piping hot, like we like it. The atmosphere was busy but family oriented. Children, seniors, couples, groups, single diners...Everyone was there. It is a great place for delicous food at a reasonable price"}
{"text":"I love this place, i went twice this week! i got the banana nut pancakes, which were amazing! They are topped with bananas and nuts and bananas baked in the cakes!!! SOOOOO good!  The next time I got the strawberry waffle, which was topped with fresh straberries and whipped cream!!! Yum. My bf got the baked apple, which was like having dessert for breakfast.  Not a fan of the oj, it says fresh squeezed but did not taste like it. But you get a ton of food at a good price!"}
{"text":"This place has the best breakfast food.  And you don't have to wait if you call ahead to put your name in!  It isn't too expensive either."}
{"text":"We just ate there this morning. The manager stood around staring at all the women, ( which made my girlfriend uncomfortable) the entire time, while the waitress hustled around to keep up with the crowd. So if you want you wife, girlfriend or daughter's drooled over by the manager stop here, the foods pretty good and aside from the manager the staff was great. We won't here again even though we live 4 blocks away."}
{"text":"We were in Fitchburg for the first ever Fitchburg Flea Market on Sunday and decided to stop by the Pancake Cafe for brunch.  The restaurant was busy, but we were seated immediately at a large booth in the \"upstairs\" section (which is really just raised up from the rest of the seating. This was perfect for my family with 3 potentially rowdy kids.  My kids shared a half order of chocolate chip pancakes (three total) which was the perfect amount for them. I didn't try them, but they looked delicious. (I posted a photo...see for yourself!) I had the Southwestern Omelette which was pretty okay.  It didn't have a ton of flavor, but some salt, pepper and sour cream helped.  The hash browns were perfect, and I also chose toast as my other side, which was some very tasty sourdough or something of the sort - not your typical restaurant white bread. The orange juice was clearly fresh and had great flavor.My husband had eggs, meat, hash browns, toast, etc.  He, the man of many words, said it was good.  That's all I could get out of him. ;)  So - the food was decent. Not amazing, but totally acceptable.  What really stood out to me, however, was the service. Every single person we encountered working at the Pancake Cafe had a smile on their face. Our waitress was incredibly helpful. She brought our baby a dish of applesauce at no cost and was the one that informed us that we should probably just get half order of pancakes for our kids. She checked on us exactly enough to be helpful but not overbearing, and she was very quick with the check and the payment, which is always appreciated when you have lots of kids who are finished eating and ready to go!! The hostess was nice and waited for us as we slowly made our way to the table. A bus boy stopped by our table to compliment us on our cute baby. We even heard someone singing away in the kitchen as they cooked, which tells me they must be pretty happy at their job.    So - is the Pancake Cafe the best breakfast restaurant in town?  No - but it's a great place to take your family. They have tons of options and excellent service and the next time we are in Fitchburg we will probably go back."}
{"text":"Sure, there are better breakfast/brunch places other than Pancake Cafe. Service is definitely slow, but it's got most of the breakfast items you'd expect. Nothing original, but it's good nonetheless.   Pancake Cafe definitely doesn't stinge on the quantity per plate. You'd come out stuffed. The apple pancake and the German pancake are pretty good and huge in size. Their Belgian waffles are mediocre, as are their crepes. The regular breakfast items, such as eggs and breakfast meats, could be better, but it's not bad.  Overall, Pancake Cafe is average. It's not located in a busy part of town, so I'd say this  is probably one of the better places within a 10 mile radius. Just be prepared to slow service."}
{"text":"Can't say this is even close to the Best of Madison. We had awful service and our food was nowhere near best of anything."}
{"text":"I got the chorizo skillet which was just okay, but there was plenty of food. Shared some pancakes which where super good! Coffee was above average."}
{"text":"Traveling through Madison was excited to find a breakfast place as such, the menu looked and sounded great. I mean it was voted best in Madison for last few years.  I want to meet the voters great diversity on the menu without being page after page of options.  I had the spinach hollandaise crepes with potato pancakes.  I have never had a potato pancake I couldn't eat it was that bad.  Mushy tasteless obviously frozen and microwaved.  Actually everything had been microwaved.  My company had huevos Rancheros with soggy tortilla chips.  It said home made refried beans but they seemed to be the dry bagged sort with water added. My crepes were re more egg than flour which was obvobvious from coloring and flavor.  Inside spinach was slimy and the flavor seemed strange. please do not waste your money.  The service although friendly she forgot our oj and water three times.  Had to ask twice.  Plus the owner was talking business in the middle of the restaurant for anyone to here.  Not professional. Barely edible. Don't do it"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, and everyone I have been with loved their food. The omelettes are fluffy and huge! The Dutch baby is definitely a must try, but remember they take an extra 20 min."}
{"text":"The worst breakfast I ever had. Everything went wrong from start to end. The ambience is just average. Servers are running all over the place and they have no idea what they were doing. I ordered their signature banana crépes. That was crap. Had to ask thrice to get some water. The check came out wrong. All put together, that's my first and last visit...!!"}
{"text":"Long waits for Sunday brunch so expect to wait or get there right away if you want to be seated and have food on your table in a decent time frame. If you do end up waiting its worth it. The blueberry pancakes, silver dollar pancakes and most of all, the apple pancake are all to die for! Fresh, hot buttermilk pancakes with endless choices of fillers, batters and toppings. Prices are good, service is fairly quick pending time and day."}
{"text":"Standard breakfast fare not done well. Campy unprofessional service. Worn carpet. Food not special, not worth the calories.  Pricey."}
{"text":"Visited this morning on a whim, after hearing mixed reviews.  However, after eating here, i believe those reviews to be slightly in error.  Granted, the decor is quite bland and could use a definitely remodel.  The food however, was pretty good.  Three out of the four of us got breakfast omelets, and everyone seemed to enjoy their food.  Omelets were big and fluffy, with plenty of ingredients.  Sides were good, and the bacon was super thick and tasty.  Additionally, our waiter was quite friendly, attentive, and professional.  I was pretty surprised to see a Chicago Style Italian Beef on the menu, and as a self declared italian beef connoisseur, had to give it a shot.  Was actually pretty decent, albeit a little skimpy on the meat.  I probably wouldn't go out of my way for this place, but would eat here again if in the area and looking for good food at a good price."}
{"text":"Our family stopped in for breakfast on a Tuesday around 10:30, after a particularly emotional morning.   We were pleasantly surprised to find out they have a full bar, with Bloody Mary's on the menu!  Decent Bloody Mary's, not stellar, but the bacon was a nice touch. Portions were large.  The omelets were big and fluffy, hashbrowns were crisp, and the biscuits and gravy were good.  The main reason for the review today was the waitstaff, Roberto.  The guy was great.  He initiated with standard small talk and the food was served promptly.  It was what happened afterwards which was just what we needed...he asked if we like magic!  Cheesey right, especially for a table with the youngest was 28 years old! I don't know if Roberto picked up on our sadness, but magic was definitely what the doctor ordered.   He performed for us for about 10-15 mins(at 10:30am on a Tuesday, we were one of few in the restaurant), simple slight of hand tricks that left the table laughing and in disbelief.   If was a fun few minutes of distraction in an otherwise sad day. Thanks Roberto."}
{"text":"One order of the BEST swedish pancakes w/ lingonberries, please :)  Minus one star for the turkey sausage, it tasted a little weird, but overall a great breakfast place that leaves you full (and probably a little fat :)"}
{"text":"Hands down best place for breakfast! Whenever we have visitors, we always take them to Pancake Cafe for breakfast. The apple pancake is completely worth the wait! I am obsessed with biscuits and gravy, and this place has the best I've had in the Madison area. It's always so hard to choose a meal, because you really can't go wrong here! One thing I do find a bit odd is the large, blown up photos of the menu items. I feel like it takes away from the feel of the restaurant and brings the classiness down a bit."}
{"text":"I waited 1 hour 20 minutes on a Sunday morning....for French toast.  And holy crap, it did not disappoint.    Thick cut sliced bread, dipped in a sweet royale, served piping hot.  With REAL butter.  And syrup (not real, but sometimes life isn't perfect).  S.T.R.O.N.G coffee!!     Swift service.  Perfect French toast.  Lovely coffee.  (Bring the Sunday paper to read while waiting to be seated.  And hearing protection to save your ears from the cranky kids).  OH!   AND they serve mimosas and bloody marys!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not good. I came here for a birthday brunch and was disappointed. The menu sounded amazing, but the omelets were bland and rubbery. I had to douse my ham and cheese omelet in hot sauce and salt--something I'd rather not do. A few people in our group ordered the pancakes, which looked (and tasted) amazing. I probably won't be back, but if I returned I would be ordering the pancakes for sure."}
{"text":"Luke warm breakfast food slowly prepared and served. The kids loved the french toast and dad had the huevos rancheros all were tepid warm. The floor was rather entertaining, covered in garbage and food, I am sure it had not been swept for at least one day. I would recommend Dennys over this place."}
{"text":"Just OK.  Food is OK, service is OK, atmosphere is OK, and that's OK.  I wouldn't travel for breakfast here, but if convenient and you happen to pop in... Well, you'll be OK."}
{"text":"Pancake Cafe holds a special place in my heart,   I've been here several times and tried the famous apple pancake, bacon pancakes, pumpkin pancakes, and lately I've been really in love with their crepes.  They also have delicious thick cut bacon. I'm surprised people don't like the pumpkin pancakes because my boyfriend is crazy about them and gets them every time.   Speaking of my boyfriend, we went here on our first date.  To the Yelp-er who said that this is where people take their one night stands... almost fell off my chair laughing at that one.  We went back for our 1 year anniversary, we'll be back for number 2.  :)  My one caution is that yes, it is as ridiculously crowded as everyone says it is, so be prepared to wait or go on an week day."}
{"text":"The two star rating is actually pretty liberal and this is only because the coffee was good. I ordered the biscuits and gravy plate with extra crispy hash browns and over easy eggs. I realize this is not one of their specialties but in my opinion it should be good if they are offering on the menu. I am from the South and I have very high expectations but the gravy was so bland am the biscuits were soft but yet dense. The hasbrowns were not extra crispy in addition to being very bland. The entire dish was lukewarm at best and service was really slow despite them not being busy (5-6 tables at the most).  The music from the kitchen was annoying and so was the servers lackadaisical attitude! The server checked me out at the register but she was on her cell phone the entire time! Why did I leave her a $3 tip? Oh yeah, because she was staring at the receipt while I filled in the tip amount and signed it."}
{"text":"Worst service Ive ever had and rudest staff Ive ever seen!  Were it not for a understanding manager, this review would be even worse!    Waited over 30 min to be seated while people with same number in party who came after us got seated before us.  Then we get \"the owners daughter\" for our waitress.  After waiting over 30 min with no food yet we told her we would pay for our coffee but had to leave.  Couldnt wait any longer. Amazingly food came out 2min later and so did the waitresses mean, nasty attitude.  Ill never ever go back.  Food was good and portions large but still wont go back!"}
{"text":"Yes, the service is fast and food is usually good tasting... but the Food isn't good enough to endure the diarrhea and occasional stomach pain. Plus their bathrooms are dirty. Something needs to change."}
{"text":"Five stars for food. The sole reason for one star is the unappealing glaring cold fluorescent lighting in this place. My garage has a classier warm feeling!"}
{"text":"I visited PC this past weekend with my family and was overall disappointed.  I've been here before and would have given them a 4 before, but this last meal was just plain bad. There was something plainly wrong with everyone's dish.  Eggs Benedict: Poached egg? Try hard boiled egg.  Absolutely solid yolk.  Huevos rancheros: soggy, COLD, and underseasoned  Spinach Hollandaise: underseasoned and the potato pancakes were very greasy.  Pumpkin Pancakes: ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.  I don't know how they screwed these up but they were bitter, salty, and doughy.  I ate one bite and sent them back.  AWFUL.    They only good thing I can say is our server was nice and attentive.  It's a shame the food was so bad.  I don't know who they're paying off to the the \"best of madison\", but they don't deserve it at all.  That was my last time at Pancake Cafe."}
{"text":"Good: 1. Service. My waitress was very friendly and attentive. She boosted this rating by a star.  2. Coffee. Nice and strong. Probably maxwell house, but not weak at all.  3. Atmosphere. Nice and open.  4. Food served fast....too fast (see below)  Not so great: 1. Food. I got the eggs Benedict.  The poached eggs were overdone (hard yolks).  The Canadian bacon was fine.  The fruit was ripe. The English muffin was not toasted at all. The hollandaise sauce was acceptable but not enough acidity. The real killer was that the hash browns were cold and raw in the center and barely brown on the top.   I have visited this place when it was pc kitchen and it also had \"issues\" with raw cold hash browns. You just can't rush them and expect them to taste good.   I might try this place one more time before writing them off for good...maybe."}
{"text":"Upon arrival on this lightly crisp Friday morning, my son and i anticipated great things on our first visit to Pancake Cafe since they had left the University Ave location.(our prior visits there were exquisite) Not too heavily trafficked at 8 30 am, the seating was quick, and our server cheery. We received coffee in a hot carafe at our table before our seats even had the chance to get warm. After a short minute, Monica ( our server) reappeared and we requested a minute or two to scan the vast selections ranging from sweet to savory.  I was quite excited, scanning thru selections and decided what my taste buds were longing for. I chose the Oven Baked Omelet with Spinach and Feta (which comes with a seriously putrid mushroom \"sauce\" on the side),Rye toast, and a side of their famous smoked Bacon. My son chose the Eggs Benedict. We also had a accompaniment of 3 buttermilk Pancakes. HERE IS WHERE IS GETS SCARY The wait for our breakfast was a tad longer then anticipated (approx 20 mins), but not to the point of frustration.   After Monica brought our meals to us, we were excited to dive in, based solely on our past experiences with Pancake Cafe.  On my first glance at my plate i had noticed my Omelet was dark and dry, and sadly was. The 3 strips of Bacon (4.95) was cold. Another sadness set in. The Rye Toast had a BURNT EDGE, not dark but Burnt and was surprised this was bypassed and served anyway. This toast was like two dried pieces of cement chiseled off of a highway median. Sadly the rest of the meal digressed just as rapidly as the first impressions. The side of Pancakes reeked and tasted of the griddle oil the hash browns were fried upon, and the \"WHIPPED BUTTER\" possessed that \"old\" taste which accompanies dairy goods left too long exposed. THIS IS THE REAL KICKER My son's Eggs Benedict were a laughable excuse for authentic and poorly executed. Before he even cut into the Poached Egg, sitting upon his Ham Slice and Soggy Muffin, we noticed that the bright yellow, obvious packet made Hollandaise was coagulated and stiff. I was Shocked. But then even after THAT first impression, he cut into this traditional breakfast entree, expecting that gorgeous flow from the golden yolk. BUT  alas that moment never happened. The yolks were hard cooked. This was just too laughable at this point.( We will post photos of this exact meal soon.)  So all in all, service was okay ..food was a HUGE disappointment!! Bad Coffee....and horrible sweet syrup. For a Pancake Place, you would think they would have real Maple Syrup. So So Sad. We were very disappointed.   If you are searching for quality food for a great breakfast , I would highly rethink before you decide."}
{"text":"Standard breakfast food done well (what, they have lunch? Well, I'll never get that deep in the menu). Dependables for me are the strawberry belgian waffle, the eggs benedict, and the small apple pancake with ice cream (more on that later). To get beyond any of those choices, I need to go several times in succession. Haven't been there in a little while. The only drawback is that it's a little more expensive than I'd like for dependable, but not amazing, food.  A couple notes:  1) It's very busy on Saturdays and Sundays, but you can call ahead 2) The fruit plate is huge. A half size will be plenty to share for a table of four in most cases. 3) Get get the *small* apple pancake *with* ice cream  Apple pancakes: It's not just a pancake. I don't really like pancakes anyway. It's kind of a very substantial baked dutch pancake with apples baked in. It's a dessert breakfast, no doubt about it. Getting it with ice cream is a MUST. Also, unless you're a linebacker for a professional sports team and haven't eaten in a week, there is no way a single person can eat the large apple pancake, so don't even try...it takes 45 minutes to bake anyway."}
{"text":"If one is lucky, the trajectory of a new restaurant goes from \"has promise, but needs to work on several aspects\" to \"everything is running smoothly, I enjoy coming here.\" After having returned to Pancake Cafe, I have to say that the restaurant is going in reverse. On this occasion, I arrived with a companion on a Saturday at about 1 p.m., after the earlier brunch rush. There were maybe 15 customers inside, and I saw our first bad omen: a group of customers who disliked their food so much that a manager was attempting to calculate a refund for them.  When we walked in, we weren't greeted at all, and there was no host(ess) present, so we took a seat and waited. After the manager put out a few (metaphorical) fires in the place, we were seated at a booth... after passing another booth that had clearly contained a family with young children. The floor of that booth was covered in partially-chewed food and utensils. Not the most appetizing thing to see when you're about to start eating. Our server brought out mugs of coffee for us - I guess that pot of coffee the server gave me on my first visit wasn't standard protocol. The half and half separated in the coffee, with some unappetizing oily beads floating on the surface. Getting our server to refill our mugs required herculean effort - we were completely unable to get her attention, and only got them refilled when she came with the check. Meanwhile, we were watching more problems play out at the register. Apparently all of their computers and credit card readers had ceased working. Customers who didn't have cash were just being comped their meals, whereas those of us who had brought cash were not. I'm not saying I just expected a free breakfast, but it's naturally bothersome when someone who ate the same breakfast as you did gets to skip out on the check due to having no cash, so to speak. I've seen this happen in other restaurants, and they always have a backup plan. There are even credit card reader programs for cell phones, and I was a bit surprised that they had NO back-up system. They could have even written down card numbers to run for the bill amounts later, but this did not occur to them.  Just about the only thing that wasn't a problem was the food. I ordered the egg and spinach naan. While it was in a menu category stating that it came with hash browns and a biscuit, toast, or pancakes, the server informed me (after I'd ordered the side I preferred) that it didn't come with toast or pancakes because of the presence of naan. Okay, would have been nice to know before I ordered (seriously, a small note on the item description would suffice), but I shrugged and went ahead with it anyway. When the food came, I learned that hash browns were apparently not included either - something ELSE that should be noted on the menu. This place isn't exactly the best deal when not ordering off the early bird special menu, and I doubt I'd pay that much for this meal, given the number of things the menu promised that were not included. The naan wasn't really naan at all. True naan is an excellent mix of crispy and chewy, cooked in a tandoori oven with little air pockets throughout. This was just flatbread, and not so much chewy as tough. It was quite difficult to cut. The eggs, spinach, and bacon were prepared correctly, and either the bread or the spinach had a delicious garlic flavor that vastly improved the entire dish. My companion ordered the huevos rancheros, and found them to be surprisingly tasty, though he was unable to taste any refried beans on the plate (though they were in the item description). It was a generous portion, enough for him to take home for another full breakfast. I really hope that this location gets its act together; it's in such a convenient location, and its parent restaurant is so good!"}
{"text":"This place was exactly what it was supposed to be. Basic breakfast food-omelettes, pancakes, eggs, and all of the usual. The corned beef was surprisingly awesome! Actually tasted like corned beef which is not always the case. Apparently they make it fresh in house every day. The rest... take it or leave it. The service was good and it's definitely a good place for families!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has gone down hill, in my opinion. Years ago I remember really enjoying the food without fail every time. The last two times my food was cold, pancakes were small/rubbery, and hash browns undercooked.   I forgot to order the bacon... So can't comment on how that may have gone down hill but I will agree with other reviewers that $6 is a little pricey for 3 pieces of bacon.   At least our sever was nice and received good service!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this establishment. My family and I got dressed early and got there at 730am. We ordered the banana crepes, a signature item the hash, another signature item and the pigs in a blanket. They all sounded good. But here is the thing the pancake cafe had chewy pancakes yuk... Plus the syrup was gross. It tasted like generic sugar with fake butter flavor. The crepes were to thick and eggy. Yes crepes are supposed to be eggy but not thick making the sweetness of the filling conflicting..  If the food was not bad enough the server forgot our catchup and every other table sent thing back as well. The topper to the meal was the horribly done hasbrowns. Stike 3. This is a breakfast joint.."}
{"text":"Stopped in for what we thought would be a quick breakfast. The restaurant was nearly empty as it was mid-morning on a week day. The service was terrible. It took nearly 40 minutes to get our food, and our waiter abandoned us after that, as he was sitting at a table with some other people in the restaurant doing card tricks. My daughter requested a drink refill that never materialized, and 15 minutes after we finished eating, I had to request our bill from the hostess.   We probably won't return."}
{"text":"We have been to the pancake cafe several times over the last four years. After today, we will never return. The place was filthy to say the least. We left without finishing our meal because it was so dirty after we watched the waitress \"clean\" the booth. She left behind more food then what was on the table to being with plus added some hair and a hair band! The slop they called food came out, I ordered the fruit parfait which used to be fresh fruit, granola and yogurt in layers. Not anymore! Now it is a bowl with some yogurt, liquid and some freezer burned fruit. Mmmmmm gets your mouth watering doesn't it. My other half order his usual omelet which is usually good, this time it was undercooked an raw in the center.. Delicious! But the best part was the excellent breakfast conversation we had listening to the wait staff in the kitchen complaining about their jobs, the patrons and going into detail of their previous nights excursions..... Needless to say, we will never return!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened, they used to be so good when they opened a few years back. My boyfriend came up this weekend and I suggested this as the place to go for some good pancakes. It was surprisingly slow for 10am on a Sunday, and we were seated immediately. We ordered our food as soon as the waitress came by for our drink orders, and we still waited a good half hour for 2 plates of pancakes and a side of bacon. The bacon came out inedible, it looked like it had been forgotten on the grill and was a few seconds away from being black. I'm not joking. I have no idea why the waitress thought this was okay to serve to someone. When we asked to have it taken back, she argued saying she thought my boyfriend had asked for it crispy. He hadn't, but even if he had, this bacon was so \"crispy\" it could have been crushed and snorted. The pancakes were alright, but between the mediocre service and meh food, $35 was unacceptable."}
{"text":"I meet friends here about once a month and the food quality and staff seems to have good times and bad times. Some of the staff are knowledgable and very friendly. They are on top of refills and always checking back to make sure the food is good. There are other staff that don't know the menu and aren't sure what ingredients are in the food.  One of the individuals in our group is gluten and dairy free. As the menu is large, she's always able to mix and match things to accommodate what she can and can't eat."}
{"text":"The service here was fairly poor. We had to change tables twice before being seated acceptably (first in a separate room even when the main room was not even half full and then next to the kitchen). After we were finally settled, the waitress was nice enough, but the seating issues ruined the service overall.  The food was also only mediocre. In fact, considering the high price (up near $10 per plate), it was pretty bad.  Overall, I wouldn't go here again; there are better breakfast places around Madison."}
{"text":"This place has one of the greatest breakfast/brunches I've ever had--consistently.  You get HUGE amounts of food for $10-15.  Want an omelet?  It's big as hell and then comes with either three pancakes or toast, and hashbrowns or fruit.  Holy crap!  I wouldn't pass up getting their amazing, melt-in-your-mouth pancakes with an omelet if it's your first time there.  Be a glutton.  Go on, you deserve it for coming here.  The OJ is fresh squeezed.    Yes, there's almost always a 20 minute wait.  But there's plenty of space to wait and you get free Kona coffee.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I'm afraid Gwen needs to get out of Cuba City a little more often, and find some better examples of pizza. My wife and I went last night on a Groupon. I'm sorry to say we had \"issues\" after. It tasted ok going down (Ok, but there's better to be found), but the fallout period was a strong deterrent.   Pancake Cafe has some good breakfast options, but their \"PC Pizza\" moniker is not ready for public consumption. I generally avoid for breakfast as the service is usually delightfully slow, allowing much time for contemplation as to the compensation package you intend to offer you the service staff."}
{"text":"We went there this morning.  This was the third time that I have eaten there for breakfast, and I have to say, I am always a little disappointed.  To be specific, I want their hash browns to be brown and for the pancakes to not be chewy.  I think that the establishment is clean and sunny, but the bathrooms could use a little more attention.  Now that I went and got myself all revved up, I may as well mention that we had to wait 20 minutes for a table and the coffee is pretty bitter.  Their bacon is thick and AMAZING though!!!"}
{"text":"Really, I don't understand the excellent reviews. While the service was excellent, the food was beyond blah. Average would have been a compliment. Our table of four ordered banana crepes, eggs benedict, pecan waffles, and the Swedish pancakes, and none of the dishes passed muster. The pecan waffles were so sickly sweet, they were cloying. The eggs benedict were not cooked properly (the yolks ooozed) and the  was... weird. The sour cream inside the crepes had a consistency I had never seen before and gave the crepes an odd flavor. And there was nothing \"Swedish\" about the Swedish pancakes - they were so thin and bubbly that they were almost non-existent, with little flavor. Disappointing. The ligonberries came straight from a jar, the syrup was fake as fake could be, the strawberries were not ripe (despite us still being in berry season!), and the ham came out cold. Again, kudos to our wonderful server. Too bad they're making her serve crap. Cannot recommend, unless you enjoy mediocrity."}
{"text":"I can see how some people are fooled into thinking this place is good.  It sort of has the feel of being a good place.  That is how I felt when we first went there.  The place is very neat and clean but ultimately they have to have good pancakes, which they don't.  We didn't enjoy our first visit as the portions were skimpy and the quality was sub par.   We decided to try them again a while later just to be sure and our experience was reconfirmed with the same bland food, odd tasting fruit salad and skimpy portions. It has now been 1 year and 3 months since we stopped going to this place.   From the reviews that have been posted I can see that the management has their head up their oven hood.  I drop them another star. Places like this that can't get their act together do not deserve to gobble up the market share of other restaurants that know how to do breakfast. Check out Hubbard Diner or Three Sisters in Middleton or The Egg and I on the West Beltline or Original Pancake House for much better food and better service."}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  My yardstick, if they have it, is corned beef hash, and it wasn't the best I've had nor the worst.  Satisfying.  My co-diners had crepes and pancakes which they raved about.  I especially liked that the crepes requested weren't on the menu and they were more than accommodating.  A little pricey for breakfast, and as mentioned in other reviews, the interior is really awful.  Not warm and inviting at all."}
{"text":"Visited this place on a sunny Sunday noon with friends, classic American breakfast/brunch/lunch place with fast and friendly service, clean and casual atmosphere and decent food. May be coming back in future :)"}
{"text":"Great find here!!! Ordered the German pancake and shared it with the table - absolute yummy!! Portions are perfect and absolutely yummy. Service is quick and the server was very attentive"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst breakfast place in the whole Madison area. Even McDonald's pancakes taste better, and at a third of the price! bottom line, one star food at two dollar signs price. If you are looking for a better place at a reasonable price in Verona, go to the HyVee restaurant (just next to the HyVee grocery store)."}
{"text":"The food was delivered quickly and was very good. Rob was our server and was very attentive even though he was also serving a large party."}
{"text":"When family ask to go out for pancakes for breakfast they name this place. And I think of a place in Nashville where people stand outdoors in line for an hour, before making it to the indoors line where dozens of pancake variations are served, and I wonder when will I next get back there?!  And that we need more authentic breakfast places on the west side!   With pancake in the name I expect varied selects. Don't count on it here. The sausage patty is the best thing available food wise. I only give in to the family on the \"breakfast out\" request so I can get the fresh squeezed orange juice. 2 stars for that!"}
{"text":"Living in the area(and loving breakfast) I totally wish I could like this place.   I just can't do it.  I feel that Pancake Cafe is a more quantity over quality establishment. Yes, you get a crazy amount of food...but it isn't even good enough to make me want to take my leftovers.  It weirds me out that the omelets  come out so toasty brown. By the time an egg gets brown it is wayyyyy overcooked. The puffy, dry texture is strange. I like a light, airy, MOIST egg. The veggie crepes I got were filled with a heavy, fake tasting cheese sauce--and were supposed to be covered in hollandaise but I thankfully had asked to get it on the side. My crepes would have been soup, and the poor spinach and mushrooms were already having a tough time of it in their cheese goo. We also got a side of crazy expensive bacon--which was so thick that it was more chewy than crispy and not worth the cash.  Maybe I should try the pancakes?"}
{"text":"This place deserves a five star review because the food was awesome and the waitress was very friendly. What more do you need really?  In our table for two, we both ordered the Country Fried Steak, eggs, potatoes, and pancakes.  A huge breakfast and all 4 parts of it were perfect.  They offered this monstrous meal for only $9.99.  Also, I love when diners do this, they left the big pot of coffee on the table for us to refill ourselves.  Very convenient.  If I find myself in this neighborhood around breakfast again, I will be sure to pop in."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  We had to wait a while (which was a little odd because it was a late Monday morning) but the food was good.  Good portions for the money."}
{"text":"What in the world happened to this place?    The food was never that spectacular - the standard Denny's or IHOP menu with better quality ingredients.  Now the line for the place is out the door as people wait for mediocre food.  The worst part is that the wait is SOLELY due to poor wait staff.  The service is just about as bad as it can get.  It literally takes 10-15 minutes to take and fill a drink order.  Then another 20 minutes to fill the food orders.  People should be flying through a breakfast diner since the food isn't difficult to prepare and should be extremely fast.  Instead this place is bottlenecked by poor service.  If you're looking for a breakfast joint, don't think that you're getting a better experience or extraordinarily better food because of the wait.  Hit up an IHOP or, better yet, if you're in the City by Camp Randall, check out Mickey's Dairy Bar."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad. But there's really nothing that makes it any better than any other breakfast place. It's like an overpriced IHOP... Not that I'm dissing IHOP, I like it just fine. There's just nothing special. Pancake Cafe does have great thick cut bacon, but a lot of dishes don't come with it and its super expensive if you get it a la carte.  The wait at Pancake Cafe on a weekend morning is borderline unbearable. Expect a 45 minute wait on a Sunday for brunch.. And it just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Well the best thing I can say about this place is it has super fast service, even on busy weekend mornings. The eggs benedict are also halfway decent. Everything else is typical breakfast food and you will not be impressed. The German pancake and the large apple pecan thingy are huge so get the small ones if you must, but I don't recommend either. Don't be freaked by the 5 in the 5 egg omelets, they aren't as enormous as you would think"}
{"text":"One of the worst customer service places I have been to since Hubbard dinner. Waited 10 mins for a server and 20 for pancakes. Average food"}
{"text":"Yep, the Pancake Cafe is where it's at on Madison's west side for breakfast on the weekends. Everything they make is a.) huge and b.) delicious. Families with kids go there. Old people go there. Hungover college kids go there. People bring in their one-night stand (you know who you are) for french toast and the short kiss goodbye. That's because it has this great ambiance of absolutely casual and really good. They freshly squeeze their own orange juice. They serve coffee (decent) with heavy cream, not half and half in garbagey little plastic containers. Frankly, I think their cheeseburgers are the best in Madison as well. These are just examples. The list goes on and on - it's a quality establishment.  Source of amusement: a fireplace in the waiting area that has a sign on it reading, \"Caution: Hot.\" Hee hee!  Listen though, the Pancake Cafe is a zoo on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Get ready for a seriously long wait. It can even be out the door sometimes. People aren't stupid, they know delicious french toast when they eat it and fresh strawberries and unbelievable apple poufs as big as your goddamned head. Go!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here! The food is great and the service is amazing! Fast and very friendly!"}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time this morning, what a disappointment, they served me raw eggs and when I complained the waiter was pretty nasty about it. He took them back but he took a long time to bring me new ones and they where burned. If you're in the Madison, WI area, find somewhere else to eat, this place is a disgrace."}
{"text":"Looks like I made another mistake by trying this place out again. This establishment is absolutely one of the worst in all of Madison.  I arrived with a party of 4 at 10.15 am, the restaurant was practically empty, yet after 45 min we had not yet been served and every dish was eggs of one sort or another. The waitress explained when I asked to talk to a manager that he was working at a different location and they only had 1 cook on duty and they were going as fast as they can. She then proceeded to bring out 2 of the 4 orders, then a few minutes later the 3rd of the 4th order, and then NOTHING!. When she finally arrived with my order, I refused it as everyone else were almost done with their breakfasts. The quality of the 3 orders that were delivered, were sub par, to say the least. None of the eggs were cut as ordered.  This restaurant is a prime example of a restaurant owner who cares nothing about his customers, the service, or the quality of the food that he serves. I'm sure that cleanliness of the back of the house most be disastrous as well.   Nobody that was working in this restaurant today gave one wit about what they threw out on the table. Pancake Café is a must miss, don't waste your money, they should shut it down, its a disgrace!"}
{"text":"The other Yelpers are correct about (1) the Groupon issue and I followed every rule; (2) the pancakes have a gritty batter; (3) the kid would not recommend this place only days after our 1st ever visit but said she would go again (Look! I don't get that at all). Maybe it's to get something else (I did wanted to try a burger).   In the end, I'm good.... as in I'm good with never going back. The Dayton Street Grille in the Concourse Hotel has locally sourced, hand-cut bacon, Marigold has decent waffles & if we're in a real pinch IHOP is a locally-owned and operated franchise on University Ave. I will acknowledge I liked the bacon but I won't take chances for bacon.  Went last week Friday morning at 8:45a as RSVP'd. Met by an indifferent hostess. Looks like a teenager that doesn't want to be at work. No soap in the ladies bathroom. I went into the men's room and was watched (by an older server) as I entered and exited. No one spoke up so I spoke. \"HELLO. How are you this morning?\" Got an answer. Then proffered when I was questioned: \"there's no soap in the ladies restroom.\" THE PLACE WAS NOT BUSY AT ALL & THERE WERE 5 SERVERS PLUS 1 HOSTESS. What gives?  They overcharged me. I had to call in to get it straighten out. I wanted to believe it was a mistake but nope!"}
{"text":"Okay place for breakfast.  Ate here on 3/29/16.  Was surprised how few customers.  Waffle was far from special.  Okay, but certainly expected something better."}
{"text":"You can't really go wrong with The Pancake Cafe!  The food is always good and the staff is nothing but friendly.  I came here last weekend for breakfast and got the corned beef hash with eggs, hashbrown's and pancakes for like $9.00!  The food was good and the service is consistently good.  My buddy wasn't so happy however!  He ordered the corned beef hash also but he ordered the Swedish pancakes instead.  We laughed because the pancake looked more like pancake skin instead of actual pancakes!  On the plus side the berries on the side were really good.  I have tried a few other things on their menu such as their bacon pancakes and their ham and eggs and love both items!  They also seriously have THE best orange juice ever!  It is fresh squeezed and never sour!  I come to The Pancake Cafe every few months but don't go too often because the wait is usually really long.  They offer Groupons pretty often so I think that definitely contributes to the long wait times.  The trick here is to go really early to avoid the lines!"}
{"text":"A group of us went here at a friend's request. The wait was ridiculous and the food was pretty terrible. Frankly, if you're looking for good breakfast or brunch in the area, you've got other options."}
{"text":"The pancakes are delicious (the best I have had in the Madison area so far). The western baked omlette with chedar cheese is just about the best omlette I have had in my life. The south west omlette was a miss for me...a bit bland, yet spicy. I have eaten here 3 times, so far. I can't wait to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"THIS BACON WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!! The hash browns and eggs were good and the pancakes were ok, but the bacon was legitimately the best I've ever had at a breakfast diner. There are literally not words to describe this bacon! I'm not a huge bacon fanatic but the waitress told me it was the most popular menu item and her recommendation did NOT disappoint. This will be my go-to breakfast venue solely because of the bacon. I know some think the menu is a bit expensive, but you actually get a shocking amount of food for the price--$10 purchases three large pancakes, hash browns, bacon and two over easy eggs."}
{"text":"The service here has always been great but the food itself is just okay. The atmosphere is bright and lively. Since a lot of families like to come here for breakfast, it's very busy in the mornings so expect a bit of a wait if you're coming in at that time. The prices are pretty reasonable, too. But, ultimately, the food being as average as it is means that this is a place that I'm happy to come to if my friends want to go but not really a place I'd crave to go to."}
{"text":"So my sister prefaced our visit with a, \"so when we get inside, it's going to look really weird and dumpy, but the food is really good\". I'd say it was a super accurate description. The interior tries to be nice and bright with some yellow paint on the walls. They got into the holiday spirit with a tree and pictures wrapped like presents on the wall but it still just didn't feel like it was tied together.  Our server was super soft spoken to the point where we actually wondered if she said anything. We still received decent service it was just more the silent type. Food was great. Their pancakes are fantastic and accompany the omelettes if you choose to order that. I ordered a bacon cheese omelette and was pleased with it. The environment and lack of verbal communication causes this review to lose a couple stars, but the food is good."}
{"text":"Quick service but food was so so. Not quite that homemade feel to the food so it was average. The place was near our hotel so we stopped in but will look for somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"A fine place for their ... well, everything !  I've had pancakes, waffles, & omelettes; all are delicious & satisfying.  Their bacon is unusually appealing - thick and well-cured.  Each tab or table has its own pot o'great coffee, too.  The Gammon Road restaurant might be too bright for some folks, but there's no faulting their breakfast fare or space for diners.  I've never felt as if other diners were too close, either.  There's a WSJ on the counter (there's a breakfast counter w/moveable stools !), a happy manager who LIKES her job, and great servers to round out the appeal.                                           A N D  Off-street parking !  Mickey's is tasty, but parking there leaves me cold.  I guess I just like-a me some Pancake Café bacon and waffle w/pecans  ~  IJDGNB !"}
{"text":"Apple pancake, fresh squeezed orange juice & thick crispy bacon make this place worth going to.   So good!"}
{"text":"Just moving back to Madison and wanting to get out of our normal routine of food chains I noticed this place while driving to woodmans. They boast quite a few Madisons Best awards so we headed on over.   Coffee is great!   Pancakes were more on the dense side with a good flavor.    Staff was sweet and got everything correct on the first go.   I ordered the eggs beni.  Im a eggs beni snob. This was damn good.  The hollandaise can make or break it and this was perfect. Eggs were done well and the set up was well put together. Ive seen some sloppy eggs beni and this was not one of them.   Husband snagged the corn beef and hash and I of course snuck a bite.  Again..  Pretty tasty.  The only down side was our hashbrowns were under done and not seasoned at all. Im guessing this is their pref to let guest season them on their own.    All in all a solid breakfast spot tucked away at the end of the parking lot.  Well be back."}
{"text":"Went in for a half hour lunch break and ordered some pancakes and a breakfast burrito to go. The woman who helped us was very kind and we ended up getting our food and leaving quite quickly, especially for it being noon! An excellent breakfast and lunch menu with reasonable prices. I got the pumpkin pancakes and did not regret it--they were fluffy, flavorful, and overall incredible. Amazing breakfast burrito for the fiancée, too. I would love to come here again, the atmosphere looks warm and inviting!"}
{"text":"Food grade: B+ Good food. Good presentation.  They could use some re-training in preparing eggs. The waffle with fresh fruit is great. I love the fresh squeezed orange juice!! Service staff is nice and polite!"}
{"text":"The layout of this building is strange. You enter through the door, and you kinda have to make your way around to get to the table where you stand there awkwardly until someone realizes that you're there to eat. I ordered a Very Berry crepe dish. It was out within a few minutes (which I thought was very, very strange considering crepes usually take quite a while to make) and it was a soggy mess with powdered sugar which looked like someone just quickly threw it on the crepes, and berry juice all over the bottom of the plate. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Before I even ate the crepes, it looked unappetizing. And the maple syrup: it had absolutely no flavor to it and I felt like I was just eating a soggy mess.   I left very unsatisfied. Even Denny's is better than this place. For any day except Sunday, I'm just going to stick with Yola's Cafe. I don't know what it is about this area, but this place and the burrito place in the same strip mall have the worst food that I've ever had in Madison."}
{"text":"As a disclaimer, I've only ever had their omelets (low-carb eater here) and they just aren't amazing for the price.  Friends who've come with me order a variety of things and while the consensus was that the food was good, it wasn't out of this world and not really any better than other breakfast joints around.  Go to the Curve if you want a killer omelet. Go just about anywhere else for more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Atmosphere:  Standard diner type layout.  Not particularly busy but not empty (Saturday afternoon).  Booths are very poorly assembled, scooting forward will pop the entire booth seat up everytime, really irritating.  The place was clean, jam holders refilled and clean with decent options instead of just a bunch of sticky \"Mixed Fruit\" that you see at a lot of diners.    Menu/Food:  Lots of selection from several different kinds of waffles, pancakes, crepes and omelettes to sandwiches for those in your party that aren't feeling breakfasty.  Food was great.    Price/Portions:  $8-15, depending on how much you get.  Prices on entrees are somewhat on the pricy-side for a diner ($4 for bacon??), especially considering most dishes don't come with entrees.  Omelettes, pancakes and specialty dishes are nicely sized.  Waffles are disappointingly small.    Service:  We were seated right away but it took awhile for the waittress to come in and check with us.  Kind of inconsistant service, as she would refill some of our party's glasses but not others."}
{"text":"My husband loves the apple pancake for some reason. I, on the other hand, do not have a favorite meal here. The place is less than average (for ambiance and food) and I'm surprised at the weekend lines at the door. My 19 year old can make better food than what I've had here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I went there for brunch today. I got the chocolate crepes & he got the chocolate chip pancakes. His pancakes were good but my crepes, not so much. They just tasted funny. I've been eating crepes since I was a toddler, & something about these just taste off. The chocolate milk also tasted watery. We got a cinnamon roll to go & that wasn't bad."}
{"text":"So they just redid some renovations with their space and menu and I think it makes the place feel nicer. We have been customers for a few months now and really enjoy their brunch. Though the prices are slightly above average, the serving size is definitely 2 standard deviations above average. I got the steak and eggs, which also comes with 3 gigantic pancakes on the side for $14.99. The steak was beautifully grilled and cooked which was a slight surprise since I was expecting just a pan seared thin slice of steak. But it was a thick and flavorful cut of steak. The pancakes were fluffy and delicious. Come hungry bc the food here will definitely fill you up."}
{"text":"I love their pancake. It's close to my house and I go there almost every weekend."}
{"text":"Great place to meet with a larger group for breakfast or lunch.  Food was good.   Waiter was good with our child."}
{"text":"Came here because I had a 50% off groupon for 2. Overall I was not impressed. There was a 30min wait, typical for Sunday brunch in Madison. Coffee was weak, pancakes were rubbery and looked processed, and the omelette was so-so. It was brown on the surface, which is never good IMHO. BF got the corned beef hash, which also looked processed and was packed into a patty. It was okay, but way too salty. Hash browns were probably the best part of the meal. The portions were certainly large, but who cares if the food isn't any good? If we hadn't had the groupon, I would've had a worse opinion of the place, as our forgettable brunch for two would've cost ~$30 with tip.  Definitely not coming back here given the plethora of brunch places in Madison, most of which offer better food and better prices."}
{"text":"This place gets four stars because of the bacon. When we walked in, the host team was smiles and bubbles and rainbows, good thing too, because our server was not. She was a bit pushy and took my SO's plate while he was still eating. \"Do you want a box or can I get that out of your way?\" There was definitely a third option. But this place had magical, beautiful bacon.  Thick and juicy, beautiful bacon."}
{"text":"Ugh. Just, ugh.  Avoid eating here.   We stood for 4 minutes in an empty restaurant waiting to be sat. Ok, fine, whatever.   Got sat, ordered food. I got eggs Benedict he got a teriyaki chicken sandwich.   Let's start with him. His sandwich was butchered grilled chicken. Like, the most mangled piece of chicken I've ever seen. I can only assume the \"chef\" kept cutting into it to make sure it was cooked. Teriyaki was bland and the sandwich itself came with basically nothing on it. Best part, it was on a bun that McDonalds wouldn't even claim as their own.  Mine. I could not eat this thing. It was an abortion of eggs and hollandaise. The eggs were sour, like rotten sour. I got all of one bite in before I couldn't even. I'm sure that one bite is going to make me suffer later too.   Service was good all things considered, but dear god, why would you eat here?"}
{"text":"had a wait a while, but it was sunday morning.  the BLT was the thickest bread and bacon i have ever seen.  it looked almost comical.  the freshly squeezed orange juice tasted like sunny-D, but i was reassured that i was wrong.  overall very good place to have brunch with your girlfriend's parents."}
{"text":"The only reason this place got one stars because I can't give it zero stars... I have given this place a chance several times. Let's talk about today's visit... I walk in the place is in that busy I'm by myself I get put in a corner with a menu... 10 minutes goes by, I have not heard from or seen my waitress I haven't got a glass of water, I haven't been offered coffee... However there is a waitress that is tending to a guy kitty corner from me about 6 feet away that came and checked on him three times and never once said hi to me. This place sucks when you get your food it's not cooked right, they don't charge you correctly, and they don't care about your business. Don't waste your time go somewhere else.  Also, the last three visits I made here we're all bad experiences with waitstaff and food. this is an ongoing problem with quality in Madison."}
{"text":"I've been here many, many times for Saturday breakfast after roller derby practice. We usually have a large group (8-12 derby girls) and they never have a problem accommodating. Even with such a large group, we typically wait only 5-10 minutes for a table (except Groupon weekend...).  The Pancake Cafe has a HUGE menu, which can be overwhelming. As Kara W mentioned, they have some original menu items in addition to breakfast staples. Their omelets are good, oven baked, and they offer a nice variety of cheese choices for the omelets. Plates are bountiful and prices are reasonable for the quantity of food. Nothing is gourmet or completely WOW, but you know you'll get a solid breakfast.   Service is friendly but slow at times. Ask for a pot of coffee for your table to \"refill your own.\""}
{"text":"Good brunch. I'd probably choose like 10 places downtown before going out to the west side though. The bacon is great and the staff is nice."}
{"text":"Omelets are my favorite breakfast and the Pancake Cafe has my favorite of all-time. The rest of the food is also great. Big restaurant so wait times are never terribly long."}
{"text":"The food is good and in my opinion fairly priced.  My only issue is the service.  Very slow and most of the staff seems to be high school teens with no training."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this location. I guess it is worth the wait at Fitchburg location. Dry and unappetizing would describe my experience. Terrible presentation of Swedish pancakes. Couldn't even eat them. My hope the Stoughton location will be better!"}
{"text":"Surprised by all the good reviews. I've been here only a couple of times and have been disappointed each time.  There just pancakes...what's the big deal? And why are they SO expensive. Perhaps I should have tried their \"famous\" pancakes. I think I had strawberry pancakes the last time I was there - nothing exciting, nothing to rave about. And I was short 10+ bucks after the meal...no fun!   The dining room is plain. Actually, I can't even remember what this place looks like, that's how plain it was.  I prefer Monty's or Hubbard Ave for a great, cheap, yummy breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is a step above Perkins/Denny's. They have great service and a standard breakfast menu.  My only gripe if they bake every too many items on the menu. For example a baked omelette. Doesn't taste right.  Pancakes and coffee are great.  My real gripe is with the thick bacon. I like it thin and crispy so I'm always sad when I can't get it.   Anyways my family loves it so we go frequently."}
{"text":"We had a chance to eat at PC Kitchen on South Gammon Road in Madison.  What a fabulous breakfast!  And you simply have to order the bacon!  Service and food was so good that we went back again--we were only in the area for five days-this time for lunch. I ordered the BLT and my husband had chicken. Once again, the food was excellent and service courteous.  I hope that the people who were not happy with the service at pancake Cafe will drive over to South Gammon and give PC Kitchen a whirl.  These Californians were very happy with both food and service."}
{"text":"Food is very good! They lose points in the restrooms. A little on the not so good side there.  That leaves a different impression on the whole experience. Having said that their food really is pretty good."}
{"text":"good selection in breakfast food and nice atmosphere. Good for family dining and very kid friendly (large boothes to accomodate wiggling & worming). corned beef hash and eggs plate, add on the pumpkin pancakes!  Service is hit or miss, unfortunately. Not rude at all, but, the attention to detail and pace of service could be improved. Still best place within 10 miles of me to have breakfast with the family.   My rating is in comparison to similar chain establishments (denny's, iHop, etc) that specialize in breakfast."}
{"text":"So I got the 1-2-3 combo which included fried egg, two slices of bacon, and three small buttermilk pancakes. That's my usual combination and I've gotten it the few times that I've been to this Pancake Cafe in Fitchburg.   The fried egg was decent tasting, and the bacon was a thickly crunchy, but the buttermilk pancake was disappointingly small and dry. Even with syrup (which was on a tray that was doused in syrup that dripped over and made it difficult to lift up the syrup container), the pancake still tasted dry.   Keep in mind that a side off 3 slices of bacon would cost $5.99 (that's $2 a slice for bacon which is quite outrageous). Additionally, we ordered a liter of orange juice to share and that was $9.99 for the bottle (again fairly pricey for juice that didn't seem like it was freshly squeezed, don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad orange juice, it just didn't warrant costing that much!).   Maybe it's just me but somehow all my meals today was disappointing but the meal that my boyfriend got was fairly delicious! I ended up picking off of his plate since his meal tasted better than mine."}
{"text":"Most used place for my family's weekend breakfast. Usually I would get good food with minimal service so I considered the lack of service a norm here. It used to have a slower speed in getting the food ready which has improved a lot recently.  There is not really anything standing out other than the fact there are enough things for you to choose from the menu. However, I heard their soup&sandwich is good for lunch so people may give them a try."}
{"text":"This is my last time here. Working in the food service industry, I can understand getting behind but there's no reason to not get an order of Swedish pancakes and an omelette in a reasonable amount of time.. It took 40 minutes to get the food and it wasn't even busy. The pancakes came out cold. The bacon had a burnt slice and 2 semi raw ones. I sent back both.  The server seemed really busy but again, not a lot of customers. Not really sure what was going on.  My boyfriend's omelette was decent but he was so hungry that he didn't care and ate it all. This place has become a disappointment and we will never return."}
{"text":"I had a great time at Pancake Cafe. It's not a classy restaurant, and that's totally fine. It's a step up from Denny's but it is no brunch on the Square, if that helps put your expectations in check.  We were served fairly quickly. I ordered coffee. I believe they brew Kona Hawaiian coffee. It's nothing special, but they didn't charge a lot for it. It was watered down, but I wasn't disappointed.  I got a half order of Chocolate Chip Pancakes - three pancakes. At first, I was unsure about them because I was expected melted chocolate. Once I realized it was chocolate sauce, I was pleased with my food.  I also got a side of hash browns. They were pretty comparable to Denny's hash browns, so I enjoyed them."}
{"text":"Not aweful and a strong step above a corporate chain but very hard to compare to the other stellar options in the area.  If you like a baked omelet this is your place!"}
{"text":"Pancake Cafe was our favorite place to eat Breakfast when they were in Sun Prairie.  We found the Fitchburg location while taking our daughter to UW-Platteville.    We ate there a few times and were never disappointed.  I have tried something from just about every area of the menu and have never been disappointed.  Now, my daughter graduated about a year ago.  We have not had the opportunity to eat there since then as we live too far away.  It is sad to see the more recent reviews.  I hope management there reads these reviews and puts Pancake Cafe back in the same place they were over a year ago."}
{"text":"Good breakfast but horrible brunch. Ruined our Mothers Day. The quality of the food was beyond sub par with powdered eggs frozen hash browns boxed donuts canned veggies and chicken too dry to eat. When asking the manager why the food was not the same quality as the restaurant she began to argue with us. Even the waitress seemed stunned that we thought the food would be the same or similar to the restaurant. We paid $72 for 4 people. My daughter ate 3 pancakes and my husband had 1 piece of ham. I had literally 4 bites and couldn't eat anymore it was just too nasty. What a bait and switch! We love the restaurant but will never ever go to the brunch again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  The eggs were honestly the fluffiest egg whites I have ever had.  I loved that they had such a large selection of breakfast items to choose from.  For brunch eaters, this is a great place.  I wasn't impressed the layout and they were a little pricey. The service was excellent though!"}
{"text":"This location is surprisingly different than the Fitchburg location. The coffee tastes different as well as the food. I didn't like the tableware as it looked like it hadn't been thoroughly washed at all. If anything I'd recommend users to stick to the Fitchburg location. I am very disappointed in Pancake Cafe for opening a secondary location and not representing themselves in a good way at all."}
{"text":"On our first visit, Mother's Day no less, we witnessed the owner rudely interacting with a table nearby.  In addition to his unwarranted and unprofessional decorum, the food was overpriced and just so-so.    Despite our poor introduction, I decided to give PC another chance. With a $20 Groupon, I visited with my 4 year old for a quick bite to eat.   After carefully scanning the menu to choose a meal to meet my Groupon, I picked out a blte for me & chocolate milk and a pancake for my child.  (The Groupon just covered these sparse items).  Not a lot of food options for the $20; and once again the food was average.    Here's the part that really rubs me wrong. As we were two steps out the door--my 4 year old son carrying the individual wrapped of crayons available at the hostess desk--was hustled down by the owner who hurried after us to confiscate the crayons from my son.  The sad look on my son's face said it all. We will not be back to the PC."}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day brunch. Had a reservation at 11:15. The reservation lady could not find our reservation, sent us over to the main entrance claiming we must have a reservation over there. Go over there and find out they are not even doing reservations and reservations are only for the buffet. We didn't even bother to stay, it was so unorganized. Also would like to note that there were at least 10 open tables with about 25 people waiting for \"buffet reservations\" Not quite sure who was running this today, but it was so unbelievably organized.   Initially I didn't really care for this place but always went because my fiancé loves everything about this place. Was very disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been a Pancake Cafe regular since I moved to Madison. They captured me with their great service and awesome crepes.  Sure, it's not a fancy restaurant, but it is warm and homey. We often have the same server and she is nice and attentive.   I originally ordered the spinach crepes, and realized it wasn't for me. They were happy to hook me up with the Blueberry Sour Creme Crepes, and OH HOT DAMN! I dream about those crepes. They are refreshing and delicious. The price is just right for how stuffed I was after eating just part of my crepe plate. They were so amazing, I couldn't stop eating- and I needed to be rolled home afterwards.   Their coffee is simple and a good compliment the the sweet breakfast foods I enjoy. I just tried the Cinnamon French Toast and would recommend  anything that comes with the cream sauce, because that was delicious.   Things that didn't impress me- the cinnamon roll is lack luster, and the sausage links aren't the greasy, spicy breakfast sausage that I like to indulge in.   Overall, good place, good food, large portions. Try it out."}
{"text":"I visited mid-morning on a weekday and had no problem getting a table. It did begin to fill up as the lunch hour approached. Pancake Cafe has a very cozy interior, which is just the way a breakfast place should be. My group ending up lounging and chatting for almost three hours. Our server was very gracious, kept the coffee coming, and never pushed us to leave.  My last visit was in the fall. I got the pancake of the month--pumpkin pancakes! They were good, but only slightly pumpkin-y and otherwise your standard pancake. Next time I think I'll try something with a filling or a topping rather than a flavoring. The hot chocolate was mediocre, definitely not homemade.  The menu is varied enough to satisfy anyone--from sweet to savory, breakfast to lunch, German pancakes to Belgian waffles. Very large portions for decent prices--you can order a half serving for $1.40 less."}
