{"text":"left this place pretty disappointed.. The person that took my order wasn't kind enough to explain to me the difrence between a box combo and watts on there menu wich with box combo you get more for your money then having to buy all the sides separate. She said I haft to tell them (OK  ) the whole trying to figure out issue takes about 5 minuts of my lunch break and embarrassing moment as there is people in line waiting to order. Finally I get my order to go and on my way out I decide to check my order and it's not all there here we go again pretty disappointing i payed with a 50$ gift card Im not shure if I wanna go back to this kind of customer service ...  didn't even get a sorry !!!"}
{"text":"So recently it was my birthday, so I did one of those birthday deal searches on Google and this place came up... So I joined there website Yoda Yoda.... I got a coupon for signing up with them and another coupon for it being my birthday... 2 ham sandwiches, and it was awesome because they weren't buy on get one deals either... 2 honest to God coupons...  Sooooo the food was phenomenal!!!!!! The best ham sandwich ever, well... That can be purchased at a restaurant. The ham was delish... Also there sides are yummy, and well obviously you can just about get any kind oh ham there, they also offer all types of meats, ribs, bacon? Chicken etc, etc.  And the building is pristine, was treated well by staff, even spoke with the owner who was a cool guy. Definitly worth yelping about."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to HoneyBaked Ham for lunch on the weekends. They make great sandwiches, and once in a while I pick up some of their sugar bacon.   Walking in I was promptly greeted. It took a few minutes for me and my friend to decide what we wanted, but the staff were very patient and nice. They had some samples to try of the Ham, and the smoked turkey, which was a great little treat before ordering. We each got a Ham, Smoked Turkey, Cheddar Cheese on a Bakers roll. The only difference was I added bacon, lettuce and tomato. For a side, we had the fruit salad. The food came out quickly, but I always forget to ask for it heated. The sandwich is still very good as a cold cut, but I prefer mine warmed up. That was my fault not theirs.   During this trip the Ice maker with the fountain sodas was having some issues. I thought it was out of ice, however it turned out it wasn't working, and the staff just said you need to keep trying and it will work. I looked at it and saw how the mechanisms worked then figured out how to get ice, but it was just an odd experience trying to get ice.  The cafe also had religious music playing. I am not going to say if that is good or bad, I am just adding into the review for completeness. I have been to places where unsensored heavy metal music was playing, so I just want this to be as a complete review as possible.   Overall, they have a ton of sandwich options for lunch, and the sandwiches are always tasty. While you are there, I also recommend picking up a package of the sugar cured bacon...it will increase your breakfast cred a few point."}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful. Delicious sandwich that tastes homeade. Ham and mustard were both great. Potato salad was fresh. Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Good Sandwich's at a Fair Price  From the moment you walk in the door at the Honeybaked Ham Company Cafe you are greeted with friendly smiles. I have stopped in for a quick sandwich on several occasions and have always had a good experience. The Honeybaked Ham Company Cafe offers good sandwiches at a fair price.  Thr cafe is small however, the Honey Baked Ham has  a wonderful selection of sandwiches. The most challenging  part of your visit  is selecting a sandwich. There's the stacker, tavern club, ham salad, and my favorite the chicken salad which is always a good lunch choice.  If your looking for a quick bite to eat, stop by the Honeybaked Ham Company Cafe  the food is always good and the staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Love the \"Make your own sandwich\" option. Not a cheap lunch, but so fresh it's worth it. Friendly staff and quick service. Great place for lunch"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here and got the BBQ smoked stacker and the ham classic with a potato salad. It was really good, the sandwiches are stacked with ham. The facility was also very clean. For a semi fast sandwich, this was a great choice!"}
{"text":"A great place to eat a good sandwich, this is a franchise and the owner's are extremely friensly, offering up all kinds of taste tests in the minute or two that you are waiting for your food.  I turned my company on to this place and this is now an office favorite when we order food in!  Try the Club sandwich, with the original sliced honey ham...it just feels so right!"}
{"text":"A little known fact is that HoneyBaked Ham sells sandwiches and other lunch-type fare.  Take advantage of this opportunity.  They use their own mouth-watering, thick-sliced meats and really take the deli sandwich to a new level.  I had their classic ham sandwich and it was great.  The ham was fantastic, especially when paired with their dijon mustard (and I don't even like mustard!!).  The loss of a star here is because the bread was a little tough and roughed up the roof of my mouth.  Ouch.  Other than that, it was great and they have a lot of offerings from hot and cold sandwiches, soup, etc.  Check it out, you'll like it."}
{"text":"I like Honey Baked Ham. I did use a Christmas gift card to get some goodies. I have been told there was turkey and ribs sold here. And there is.  I never knew that there were other meats other than ham. I ended up getting some ham and turkey pulled pork and some white bean soup mix that I am going to make this weekend.  The turkey is very good nice and moist and has the brown sugar on it that the ham does. It comes sliced so you can make turkey sandwiches. I have not tried the pulled pork yet that will be for a quick dinner one of these days I will update that later. What I did like was the friendly and patient employee that took her time with me and didn't try to rush me out the door because they were almost closed by the time I got there. Thumbs up for being very helpful tool.  I did save some of my gift card so I can make it for lunch here one of these days. I bit pricey but good for special occasions."}
{"text":"Looking for a high quality, quick, sandwich, potato salad, lunch?  This is the place!  My favorite is the ham ole (it's a special menu).  Every sandwich I have had has been great!  The meat and ingredients they use are high quality and full of fresh flavor.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great lunch at Honey Baked Ham Cafe. I ordered the Ham & Turkey Deli Stack (with swiss & cheddar on a European white roll, no lettuce, tomato, or honey mustard). I also made it a combo with the baked beans. We thought their iced tea tasted weird (earthy?) so I got root beer instead. The sandwich was delicious. Their meats are always fresh and yummy. The bread was soft and good. The beans are very good as well. The meal also came with a pickle. It was more than enough food and I couldn't finish it all. The cafe was quiet which is a nice alternative to many of the places we eat."}
{"text":"First time in one of these stores, Very busy today for the holidays, pleasent staff and clean looking in store."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast, and fresh. Great customer service. Delish sandwiches and the price was very reasonable. Clean. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Bad service model and rude management and owner.  Corporate did not care enough to follow-up with the customer.  I would never go to another Honey Baked Ham store now after being a customer for 30 years."}
{"text":"I did not know the honey baked ham store served lunch, but my husband and I were at Costco across the street so decided to try it.  Pleasantly surprised!  Staff was friendly. Food was good.  Lots of ham and turkey on our sandwiches. Only $7.29 for a sandwich and soup or salad.  Very clean.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that we wanted salt and pepper, and then later I also needed a to go box (because it was a big sandwich) and the staff was back in the kitchen area and with no way to get anyone to help us had to wait until they came back to the counter.  I suggest a \"bell\" on the counter."}
{"text":"This place has great food the service is always first class and will do what it takes to make you happy.  I love there club their para to soup is amazing. Stop by for lunch it is worth it"}
{"text":"Best quality meats for sandwiches hands down, when you compare it to JJ's or Subway around here.  I usually get their club on croissant and man, it's so good!  Their sides are always fresh and you can tell it's made on location, not made in a factory and shipped in plastic bags here.    They're kind of hidden in the corner, so I think that's the only reason more people don't know about HBH."}
