{"text":"Inexpensive, friendly, tasty diner. I was in town last week, and my friend suggested we meet up at the Country Cafe. I got the cinnamon roll french toast with a side of sausage links and coffee. We spent about three hours talking there (all the way from breakfast to lunch!) but the servers were completely gracious about it. Our grand total after downing a ton of food was a little over $12 for both of us. Yay for specials!  From the outside, it is not the most scenic of  restaurants, but inside is what counts!"}
{"text":"Classic diner - without the heartburn! Our family loves this restaurant. My daughter is addicted to the cinnamon roll french toast. My son loves the cheeseburgers and I LOVE the Deluxe salad with amazing french dressing (yes, it's that good!) The ranch is good too (with chicken strips of course!)"}
{"text":"First time here. Very dissapointed my waitress was very rude, my food was wrong, coffee was nasty. Could have been a bad day but will never come here again. Threw up in parking lot right after eating. If I could give zero stars I would...."}
{"text":"This is now called La Fogata.  They still make your all american breakfast right which is great because that's what we came in for. The bacon was very meaty which I like and pancakes where tasty. My husband ordered a Mexican breakfast and thought it was exquisite. Thx! Gave it a four star because I can't do 3 1/2"}
{"text":"I want to give Scott D. a great big thanks for the photo he posted of their steak. It was his photo that drove me to this place. There are few diners/cafes in my area that can put sear marks on their steaks as well as this place. The char marks can elevate an otherwise ordinary piece of meat to the next level. Under char and it's only window dressing without the complex enhancement of the flavor. Over char and it's just a burnt piece of meat. Do it just right and it becomes heaven on the end of a fork. Proper charring is fairly common in mid to high end steakhouses, but somewhat rare in my experience at a diner. My steak was of very good quality and perfectly trimmed of fat. Those little bits of fat when charred crispy is what really takes the steak over the top. Low end chain steakhouses can't buy the well marbled cuts or it would price them out of their category. No amount of perfect charring or saucing can save a substandard cut of meat. It's like putting an expensive saddle on a dead horse, you're still going nowhere fast. The magic only happens when the fat within the cut renders down and hits the hot griddle. Country Cafe selects cuts that are normally outside of their category to our great advantage. Hats off to them. I always order my steaks on the rare side and most diners don't have the burners turned up hot enough to give it the proper grill marks without overcooking the steak. Just as a cook/chef can have a random \"off\" day, he or she might have an occasional \"good\" day. I went back the next day to test if my meal the day before was skill or luck. I am happy to report, the man responsible for my meal is a Grillmaster. The reason I couldn't give this place 5 stars, rather than the 4.5 that I can't post, is because of the location. It's a bit out of the way for the average tourist, but is still so well worth the effort."}
{"text":"Just dined here for breakfast. On a busy Saturday morning, was able to get a seat and asked what I'd like to drink and served very quickly. Service was on point and spectacular, and the food was great! If you're looking for a cafe with great food, priced right menu and a great service staff, try this locally owned family restaurant in the northern Madison area in Sun Prairie. Check it out, you won't be disappointed! Thanks to Tammy and Cassidy for the great service! Will be sure to come back again."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS SERVICE!! I was excited to try this place after good reviews on Yelp and eating at the same location when it was Manuels, the Mexican place. However, when we arrived, we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. It then took an additional 10 mins for our waitress (the oldest lady there) to even acknowledge us and get drink orders. After placing our order, we finally received our food after a 20 minute wait. To add insult to injury, our order was all wrong (ie No gravy included on the chicken dish, tomatoes when none were requested,etc). The final slap in the face was paying $50 for a family of 4 to eat there. Your better off going to Dennys or IHOP."}
{"text":"Seat yourself at this friendly restaurant.  Good burger.  Peach cobbler ala mode was good.  Might want to try the apple pie next time."}
{"text":"Growing up I always loved their giant cinnamon rolls so while visiting Sun Prairie, I thought I would return to see if they were still as good. The outside of the building is falling apart, which should've been our first clue that they really didn't care about their image. After we got seated, we waited and waited to place our order while the 3 servers on duty stood across from us chatting. Finally, one of the other 3 tables in the restaurant had to interrupt them to ask for more coffee. We sat waiting for a few more minutes for someone to take our order but finally got up and walked out. No one said a word. I'm not even sure they noticed. Skip this dive and go to Sir Hobos. The service at Sir Hobos is always prompt and friendly; their food and menu options are great!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years!!! The staff is soooo friendly and the service is top notch. The food is very good and the portion sizes are fantastic for the price. The country fried steak and the ranch are my wife and I favorite meals. I love that it is family owned and they treat every guest like family. Such a great atmosphere and everyone is always helping or doing something. If you are looking for a great meal at a reasonable price and a good Family atmosphere this is definitely your place!"}
{"text":"I have been in Vegas for about 4 months and have been in search of a local restaurant like what in California. This place is near my home and I had read some good reviews but, unfortunately, it was a disappointment.  I had the open-faced turkey and mashed potatoes. The turkey was mostly dark meat - which I do not like - and it was dry. The mashed potatoes had hardened a bit, like they were left under a warming lamp. The vegetables were dry and tasteless. I ended up leaving most of the meal uneaten. It was a shame because I so love turkey and mashed potatoes.  My husband had some kind of scramble - eggs, hash browns, bacon, etc. He said it was not very good and he also left most of it uneaten.  Overall, it was just a bad experience and one I will not be repeating."}
{"text":"Stayed at the hotel across the street and found this place. Wound up going twice. Good service, pretty decent food and definitely inexpensive. It was overall a good find."}
{"text":"This restaurant is good to average. Better than Pine Cone truck stops. AWESOME country fried steak but not many if at all gluten free choices."}
{"text":"Good southern-style country cooking, just like the name implies.  People are friendly, though waitress was a little slow.  Okay - a lot slow.  But at least she was friendly.  Be forewarned, they stop serving breakfast early, like around 10.  The neighborhood is a little sketchy too - park so you can keep an eye on your car.  Oh, and the owner dude was trying to show me a picture of a whale shark and was telling us it was a giant catfish.  Doesn't anybody read anymore?  I mean, who can't tell a whale shark from a catfish?  People are getting increasingly stupider.  But at least these dudes can cook."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I agree with the 2 previous reviews on food, price, atmosphere, I could see some of Heather's silly description really happening.  Not the healthiest place to eat, with low fiber bread, etc.  Good oldfashion greasy spoon that really cares about their customers.  No modern smoke and mirrors here."}
{"text":"Good inexpensive cafe food. Pleasant waitresses. Things on menu you won't find in franchise restaurants."}
{"text":"Country Cafe is a Sun Prairie staple. It's affordable,  consistent,  hearty,  and pleasurable comfort food. The service is good, and friendly.  They are accommodating and patient.   The food is basic diner fare. There's something for everyone and you won't leave hungry. I've eaten l breakfast,  lunch,  and dinners here for over 20 years with my family and never had a bad meal.   Some of the standouts are their waffles,  fried chicken,  fish dinners, and homemade soups. But really I can't think of anything that I wouldn't order again."}
{"text":"food/service was ok. nothing special imo. i had a chicken sandwhich with hot sauce. id like to of had a beer with my lunch but they only had rootbeer. and the place did smell a little odd, kind of like a bathroom maybe it was the cleaning products?? it would be a lot nicer if they served beer and had the place smelling like the food theyre cooking. although this nellis location is closer, i liked the older location better."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened here... service was aketchy,  booths were filthy (could you vacuum the crevice of the sears??)  Prices were up, buy the food was good...  might be better places to stop ..."}
{"text":"My next-door neighbor, who is 84 and has lived in Sun Prairie all her life, recommended this place for breakfast. It has some very kitschy decor (basic small-town breakfast restaurant style) with lots of gingham and wooden chickens, but I didn't care.   Nothing on the menu looked very exciting, and it seemed like everything cost a dollar or two more than I would have expected. But the waitress was extremely nice, the coffee was good, and the food (I got the mushroom and cheese omelet) was great. My omelet had three (3!) kinds of cheese and lots of nice 'shrooms inside. It was terrific and also came with hash browns and my choice of toast/pancakes/muffin. I got the rye toast, as always.    We got there around 8:30am (on a weekday) and almost had the place to ourselves but more people kept trickling in as we ate."}
{"text":"I live in Colorado and was returning home to Wisconsin for a wedding. So happy to find this amazing little diner off of Highway 151. A hardy old-fashioned breakfast with real food and friendly service"}
{"text":"Being in a strange town.....Sun Prairie, WI thought I should eat a good breakfast. So I found the Country Cafe. Typical coffee shop with locals gathered at the counter swapping stories about farming and hunting.  Got seated and ordered the Early Rise breakfast....2 pancakes, 2 eggs, and 2 bacon strips. Had coffee while waiting and the waitress came by three times to refill before my plate came. Pretty good service I think. Food came and it was just right and tasty!  Nice place very clean and well lighted with lots of parking. The waitresses were all wearing Green Bay Packers tshirts....go Packers!  Reasonable prices too...out the door for $8.50 not bad! I have no problem recommending the Country Cafe!"}
{"text":"Comfy place, decent service and great service. Not outstanding but very consistent all the time"}
{"text":"Well how-deee ya'll!!    Are you 90 years old?  Do you live in or around Sun Prairie?  Well then you must hang out at the Country Cafe!  Everybody from the old folks home was here tonight.  Most of the time, I love old people, and here is why.  They are old enough now, that they will say what they want and not think twice, you know why?  Cuz they are old, and what are you gonna do?  Take away their walkers?  Take the brake off their wheelchairs?  Hell no you ain't!    I am drawn to slightly inebriated old ladies and goofy old dudes who spend the evening talking at length about mosquitoes and hip replacements.  Hey look!!  There is a guy over in the corner with all his teeth on the table, and another dude with a dog hidden under the table.  That man over there is pushing an empty wheelchair around in circles!  It's like a geriatric wonderland, and I am Alice!    The food here is just ok, but the prices are very cheap, and the service is excellent.    I wanna be awesome when I'm 90.  *crossing my fingers*"}
{"text":"Family run diner-Good food -good service-fun & friendly atmosphere.  We ordered breakfast-I had the 12oz NY steak breakfast special,the wife had potato & onion pancakes with applesauce and the boy had biscuits & sausage gravy.  Like having a home cooked meal.Only better-No cooking or dishes!!  The food was better than expected-the potato pancakes were \"to die for\" and the biscuits & gravy was fresh. The steak was charbroiled to perfection(medium rare). The coffee was strong & fresh.  SOLID 4 stars!:)"}
{"text":"Solid little country diner in my opinion. Don't go in expecting glitzy decor or anything fancy. The food was good enough to take me back to high school when we \"ruffians\" would hang out at places like these. The service was good too. Fast and friendly, what you'd expect from this sort of place. Yes, it is a magnet for the seniors, but really, what diner isn't? Plus, it's not like grandma and grandpa aren't going to be able to find good, yet inexpensive food."}
{"text":"Great place for great breakfasts and service. Home cooked and friendly competent staff."}
