{"text":"My god, the hot pastrami. The latke's with applesauce and sour cream. Too bad the Bay Area Max's chain isn't this good."}
{"text":"No Smelly Deli!

THE UP-SIDE:  A hip deli with lots of room and tasty grub.  Big servings and great tasting dishes make this place a long-standing favorite.  They even serve beer!  Plus, the desserts are FRIGGIN YUMMY!

THE DOWN-SIDE: Sorta gets old after a while.  It is, after all, just a deli in nice wrapping.  Plus, the service - while speedy - is usually quite impersonal.  

THE SUM-IT-UP:  A great little deli with a hip atmosphere and good food.  Definitely save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I miss Maxs..  They had the best matzo ball soup and pistrami!  The desserts were HUGE and they had pretty decent beer selection!!"}
