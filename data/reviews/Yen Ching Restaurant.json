{"text":"YUM!: This place is great. It's not commercial chinese, it's got great flavor and a wonderful atmosphere. I've been going there for the past 13 years of my life. The sesame chicken there is the best I've ever had (and I've tried at least 20 restaurants all over WI and MN) and the rice dishes are great. My boyfriend loves to get beef dishes and they are fabulous. The food is worth the price ~$8 a dish I think. It's a cute place, go check it out!  Watch out, closed Mondays!"}
{"text":"I am very sad that this place close but they did open up a new restaurant in Hilldale Mall called the \"Dumpling Haus\" they don't have all of there classic dishes but they do have most of their soups along with some very very good noodle and dumpling dishes... check them out!!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that we have this Chinese place in Madison!  Being an Asian, who has lived in various international cities, I believe my experience with Chinese cuisine is quite substantial. I find all of the Chinese places in Madison dreadful, if not offensive. But Yen Ching is the exception.  They do a good job. Friendly staff and decent dinner menu.  I'll keep going back to this place!"}
{"text":"GREAT food, good prices.  Really nice staff.  BEST Sesame chicken we have ever had. Definately NOT fast food chinese"}
{"text":"After searching for places in Madison for some good Chinese food, Yen Ching by far was the best.  Their Mongolian Beef cannot be topped and service was fantastic.  Too bad their delivery area does not reach my house but who cares, it is worth the drive to dine in or take out for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Not the best I had...As a previous reviewer said they also took at least an hour to deliver our food (though in all fairness we were a little out of their range)...Though when we got it it was still hot...Otherwise this was just run of the mill typical Chinese food.  For Madisonian it might be some of the best but for a Chicagoan I would say not..."}
{"text":"I had my doubts, but it was great. The food is made fresh. Appetizers were my favorite part. Pot stickers and egg rolls - delicious!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the service :)  We visited this place right off of the Beltline on a cloudy Sunday morning for the very reason that they offer Dim Sum, which brings to mind for most Chinese small plates of pure joy and deliciousness. However, knowing that this is Madison and having experienced other smaller cities, I wasn't expecting this place to be going all out with carts after carts of hot food.  And I was right. The so called \"Dim Sum\" here was just a changed menu offering traditional Chinese breakfast I grew up eating and loving: You Tiao (fried dough stick), Dou Jiang (sweet or salty soymilk), Doufu Nao (best thing ever! :), pork bun, shrimp shumai, marinated beef slice, etc.  So if you're craving traditional Chinese breakfast dishes like these, this place is a very good choice as the only other place I know that offers them in Madison is Hong Kong Wok. But the most memorable thing about this place is the service. The waitress we had was very friendly, especially if you speak Chinese :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here after reading the high reviews and were REALLY disappointed. We visited on a rainy day and they had buckets all over the restaurant to catch water from the leaking roof, and the bathroom was even worse. I've seen cleaner dive bar bathrooms. Serious. Aside from the buckets and bathroom, the food was mediocre at BEST. The sauces tasted like they came out of a can and the egg drop soup was terrible! We won't be back."}
