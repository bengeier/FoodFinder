{"text":"The food at this spot is so fucking excellent. Went with a group of buds and had the Hundy P - it was great value for money, everyone was stuffed and we basically got to sample the entire menu which was awesome. When you get to eat so many delicious things in one meal it's near to impossible to call out what was best. We were 5 people so here are 5 different things we loved in no particular order.... beef brisket, jalapeno cheddar sausages, mac & cheese, smoked chicken and frito pie. If you are reading this you should probably just eat there. Don't waist your time with my dumb yelp review and just experience it for yourself."}
{"text":"Been here a few times in the last few weeks, I get a craving for this type of food. I've tried most of the menu, Everything I've had is banging! The Dry rub ribs, the brisket, the smoked chicken. My faves have been the Bama chicken sandwich, the house made jalapeño cheddar sausages and the mac and cheese. I know the chef does Jerk chicken too (which i've had at one of his pop ups) but only on certain days. please go!"}
{"text":"Went there with a group of friends and had an amazing dinner. We got there before the dinner rush so were seated right away. The waiter was friendly and gave us time to go over the menu. The menu was short and sweet which is what I look for shows that they are always working with fresh ingredients. Loved the food! The collards were the best collards I've ever had! All the dishes were such home feel cooked feel. Will definitely visit them again"}
{"text":"Wow! I can't believe how blown away both hubby and I were by the food here. We happened to drop in when looking for a new place to eat on Dundas. The waitresses were very nice and just the right amount of attentive.  We ordered the \"Trey Deuce\" platter for two with Mac & Cheese and Watermelon salad as sides. Also got a side of beans.  First of all, the ribs were perfectly cooked. One bite was all it took to say, \"this is how ribs are supposed to be cooked\". So juicy and tender with a very distinct flavour that reminded me slightly of a pepperette.  The beans were good. A little bit sweet, not too dry, very meaty. I am a picky bean eater that prefers the Quebec maple brown sugar flavour, but these were nice too... mild.   I am not a fan of the watermelon salad.  Though watermelon is always refreshing, I found the oil really took away that element that I was anticipating.  I can't forget the Mac & Cheese.  I try and try, time and again to find great Mac & Cheese  with that yummy breadcrumb crust on top. There have been so many disappointments.  The great news is I can stop looking. Smoke Signals BBQ has the best, most satisfying, cheesy delicious, Mac & Cheese any restaurant has ever offered... at least that i know of. Sooo yummy.   I saved the best for last.  I've never ever, ever had beef brisket that even remotely compares to the melt in your mouth, thick, tender, seriously buttery brisket from Smoke Signals BBQ. It had a wonderful bark and I still can't believe I wanted to eat the little bit of fat through it. .....Shh....i ate it....don't tell hubby.  We can't  wait to bring family here."}
{"text":"This was my third visit and all three were consistently awesome.  Came for lunch, had their brisket sandwich, fries, beans, and buttermilk pie--all were generous portions. The brisket was browned & crisped, giving it great texture and the sesame roll was super fresh. Nothing  was overly salty. I'm typically not a fan of thick cut fries, but these are cooked perfectly. Beans were smoky, and super meaty, but not too sweet. The buttermilk pie is SO delicious and decadent...  somewhere between cheesecake and lemon curd. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"Best BBQ we've had in the city to date. $38 for a platter for two: two 1/2 pounds of meat and three sides. Took home leftovers. Nice service, staff, and atmosphere! Loved it."}
{"text":"It's been 12 hours since I had dinner at Smoke Signals, and I'm still full. This isn't \"I had a big dinner full\". I'm talking \"3 thanksgivings back-to-back\" full. The Mac and cheese? So good that you don't even care about the million calories you just ingested. The brisket? Life changing. The frito chilli and the ribs and the chicken and the pickled veggies? You need them in your life. When you inevitably come here for dinner, bring a big squad so you can order everything on the menu. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Super tasty BBQ. I'll def be returning. Delicious. Unpretentious and chill vibes. BBQ done right."}
{"text":"Very nice little smokehouse. We were a group of 10 and between us we ordered the brisket, smoked wings, pulled pork, Mac and cheese, Frito pie, and mashed potatoes. All of the food was delicious, especially the meats.   The service was excellent. We were greeted with smiles every time. I highly recommend this restaurant for those who enjoy real smokehouse barbecue."}
{"text":"Delicious! It's rare that you'll find me eating meat without a sauce.. The meat is melt in your mouth good. The brisket is especially tender. The platter for $100 is a total steal if you're eating with a group.  Loved the potato salad & Frito pie.  Long tables - good for groups. Good atmosphere. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Typical west-end Toronto joint: take a classic comfort food, make it decent-enough, put it in a hip, well-designed locale, jack the prices, and people will come.   Some friends took me there on a whim and overall I enjoyed it, but not sure I'd go again. It was decent, but I've had way better BBQ lately, even from friends' backyard barrel smokers.  We ordered quite the spread off the menu - brisket, half-chicken, smoked wings, beef rib, slaw, mac n' cheese, potato salad. The meat was all of good quality, but overall, everything was pretty bland tasting. Not a lot of smoke or spice, so no real depth of flavour. My favourites were probably the wings and slaw.  Now I gotta discuss where this place loses marks: the beef rib. This is listed as \"market price\" and we ordered one. It was a good size, probably had 7-8 oz. of edible meat on it, and was decently tasty, although like I mentioned before, bland. When we got the bill...the single rib was $47 f'n dollars! I started laughing. The price of a nice dry-aged rib eye for that? I've had similar beef ribs in the past that weren't even half that cost. It was pretty absurd.  Despite that nonsense, overall, I dug the place. Quality meat, good beer, nice atmosphere, but I didn't feel I got any value for my money."}
{"text":"We ordered the plate and everything was yummy. Sauce was a bit on the sour side which I like. Sausage was dry though."}
{"text":"Had the Holy Trinity which was more than enough for two.  Great value for $48.  What I would rate as some of the best brisket in the city.   Tender and very juicy!  Ribs were large and finger licking good, and the sausage flavourful.  Potato salad side was the best, savoury with a nice crunch.  Potato chip on top was a surprisingly nice touch.  Red cabbage slaw was decent, while the beans hid a chorizo sausage.  More meat!  OMG, the kimchi brussel sprouts a friend ordered (not part of the Trinity) was unbelievable, with a nice smokey flavour that changed it from a side to avoid to a side to seek out.  My new favourite veg! The staff took our party outside to see the smoker which was fun and a nice touch to the evening.  Only disappointing part was the 18% gratuity they included in the bill, which wasn't a problem since we had a large group and the server did a great job, except that if you don't take care to review your bill you might tip on tip.  Diner beware though a reminder is always appreciated."}
{"text":"Finally, Texas style BBQ in Toronto. I've eaten their food at the Sunday market and loved it. Now I can have it whenever I get the cravings. I would also recommend the frito pie and the mac n cheese. Last time I went I tried the sausage. It was great."}
{"text":"Just got the Trinity from Foodora.  The good: Killer slaw, excellent mac&cheese, decent sausage  The Bad: Brisket had a nice barque but was dry.  The pulled pork was a puny portion and lacked much flavor, and had no BBQ sauce on it.  Beans were so.  Might try again but had far higher expectations, could've been an off night."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying a new BBQ spot, particularly one with such strong brisket reviews. Due to my order, I had less variety than usual when I hit BBQ. Beef ribs were available, so I ordered one. Keep this in mind: Beef ribs are $30/lb. Each rib is around 1.5 lbs. That's $45 for one rib. Yes, that's pretty nuts, but here I am with rib in my belly. That's a lot of moolah, so it had better be good. Here is the issue: It was just OK. I liked the meat. It was moist and fatty. It had a good rub. It just wasn't as tasty and smokey as I like my beef ribs. To me, a good beef rib has a real smokey flavour and tastes like campfire. This one was really light.  My second dish was the brisket. Almost exactly the same storey here, except that the brisket price is more reasonable: Good, fatty meat (lean brisket.. blech). Good barque. Just not enough smoke and flavour. I not quite as bothered by this since brisket is commonly (in my view) more lightly smoked.  The BBQ sauces were just OK. The beef sauce had way to much of a dominant molasses flavour. The Carolina sauce was pretty good, but I had no pork. Cole slaw was boring. Not special seasoning. Cabbage and vinegar.  Will I go back? I don't know. The wings may be really good. Pork ribs might be OK. I certainly won't drop another $45 on a rib."}
{"text":"I agree with the user (Will T.) below. I don't really understand the hype behind this place, as their BBQ is mediocre at best and nothing special. I can't comprehend the warm meat they serve, either... Shouldn't it be piping hot?  Anyway, my partner and I bought two sandwiches - the El Chapo & the Bama White. For $12 each, I didn't get bang for my buck. The sandwiches were room temperature, which was unpleasant and were quite dry. The chicken inside the Bama White didn't taste smoked or seasoned either.  This place is overhyped and overpriced.   I should have gone to Porchetta and Co instead :( sigh."}
{"text":"Best freggin BBQ north of the border hands down. I've been here 4 times. The beef brisket , beef ribs are amazing and juicy. They recently added some cool fun things to the menu like the bao, fries supreme and burger.  Really well done.   They do the best pork ribs in town. It's the most tender I have ever had. Server tells me the owner actually did bbq in Texas and visits often.  By far beats out the other competition. Great chill too. If you are looking for quality over quantity. Go here. NOT Adamsons."}
{"text":"Smoke Signals catered my wedding on June 3rd and they were absolutely AMAZING. I had contacted them last summer in regards to catering as we were looking for a BBQ spot that fit our (small) budget and they were in the process of opening up their restaurant. Once we decided for sure on our date and budget, we contacted Nick, the owner, in March and him & his associate Paul were super communicative, easy to work with and made us feel very at ease. We loved that we could basically order by the pound for the meats and they had a great selection of sides and the pricing couldn't have been better. We ordered the brisket, smoked chicken, jackfruit sandwiches for our veg/kosher guests, mac and cheese, brussel sprouts and potato salad.   The day of the wedding, Paul and another guy (I forget his name sorry!) showed up right on time and worked with the small kitchen in our venue without any issues. They were so nice and helpful. Now, the food was INCREDIBLE. The meats were SO juicy, cooked to perfection and very tasty. Those who had the jackfruit sandwich seriously raved about how good it was, saying it was super flavorful, and most had never had jackfruit before and now I think they'll start eating it! The mac and cheese was so good as were the brussel sprouts, but the potato salad was out of this world. Our guests couldn't stop saying how good all of the food was and kept asking us where we got it from. We had some leftovers (as our guestlist ended up being less than we anticipated) so many people had seconds and our families were able to take some home.   We couldn't have been happier with how professional, efficient and AWESOME Smoke Signals was for catering and we highly recommend them! Hopefully next time we are back in Toronto, we can stop buy! Thank you again!!"}
{"text":"Made a random stop in for a quick beer and a sandwich. Went with the \"El Chapo\" which is a bun filled with a mix of brisket, pulled pork, sausage, and slaw for $12. Gotta say, this sandwich is pretty awesome. It's flavour filled with multiple tender tasty meats which makes this a winner. It comes with a side of potato chips, which I'm indifferent towards and can't help but think a proper side of fries or even potato salad would've made this a 5 star winner.  On the beer tip, there is a small but decent selection of tallboys and a single beer on tap which is a \"Smoke Signals Lager\". It's clean drinking and pretty cheap so I'd drink it again.  A sandwich and a beer came to less than $21 post-tax / pre-tip which I'm pretty happy with, and I look forward to coming back and eating more of their tasty smoked meats in the future."}
{"text":"I came in with high hopes and the food did satisfy. Ordered the platter for two for three people (brisket, pulled pork, 2 mac and cheese and the frito pie) and added a few sausage links and we had a lot leftover. Must have: the mac and cheese, the cheese filled sausage links, and brisket. Disclaimer: never tried the ribs because they were sold out by 7.  Good canned beer selection, one Great Lakes lager on tap.   The problem was the service. They all seemed nice but we didn't have our order taken for a good 35 minutes. We kept trying to flag our server and she was gone. I went to the bathroom to see she was chatting and eating in the back. We ended up ordering from someone else who then seemed to become our server. When we asked for the bill it came quickly but then I asked for change and the next server again- disappeared. In the end she walked away with an enormous tip cuz we didnt end up waiting.  Sad because I really wanted to find a close staple BBQ joint. I may give them another chance but this experience was kinda disappointing."}
{"text":"The smell of smoke was what brought us in. Ordered two orders of the Holy Trinity platter and 2 orders of smoked chicken wings. Holy Trinity consisted of beef brisket, pulled pork, sausage (one was regular and the other was stuffed with cheese), pineapple coleslaw, baked brown beans, potato salad, pickle slices, pickled onions and a slice of Wonder bread. I personally loved the lean beef brisket with the slaw. Loved their habinero sauce, I bought a jar. Super friendly hostess/server. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Went to Smoke Signals to try out as we always walk by. It looks small but it actually has seating all the way to the back.   We got the Jackfruit Jerk Sandwich and Bama White sandwich. They were out of fries so we ordered the Mac & Cheese as well. Mac & Cheese was great! However, the Jackfruit Sandwich was a bit bland and Bama White tasted pretty good (aside from the large bone inside but I understand that's hard to avoid).   All in all it wasn't as amazing as we thought it would be but I also realize we didn't get the brisket or pulled pork or anything that is likely what this restaurant prides itself in - so I've left the rating at a 4.  UPDATE: We returned and this time had the smoked types of meat that Smoke Signals is known for and it was amazing!!! The food was so good. Portion size was no issue, that's for sure. I'm changing this review to a 5."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome. We've tried the chicken, pulled pork, ribs, fries, beans, and slaw, as well as a variety of cocktails, and all were excellent. The pulled pork in particular is among the best I've ever had. The service is always friendly and the atmosphere is laid back. And the prices are extremely fair!"}
{"text":"I came here because I red some reviews and looks like a really nice place with good food.  The result was very different... The food was good but not exceptional and the service was very cold... The waitress was totally unhelpful with the menu.   We order one of the specials (holy trinity for 2 - $37) and I think they should say that is a platter for 1.5 and not for two.  The platter has a medium size and the portions of meet are very regular.  The only big size is the sausage, the bread and the salad..."}
{"text":"It's decent, for Toronto.. Anyone spoiled with great USA BBQ, knows, had much better. Also Toronto prices, HIGH."}
{"text":"I recently had dinner here with a large group. They had reserved 2 communal tables in the back. Every diner that arrived was immediately served water by the server. Nice touch that they were on top of a large group.  I ordered the brisket, potato salad and the IPA. The brisket was so tender. The smoker took care of giving it its seasoning. No other sauce was brought out - thank goodness because I am not a sauce fan. I didn't particularly care for the potato salad; unfortunate since I love potatoes. The meal was served with a slice of white bread, pickles and white onions. This is apparently, traditional in Texas bbq.  There was barely any wait time for the meals to arrive. Most everyone in my table ordered the brisket. Everyone was satisfied."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a group of people.  The six of us got a platter called \"pick six\".  It consisted of brisket, sausages, ribs, smoked wings, potato salad, red beans, bread, fries & pickles.  We substituted slaw for fries.  The platter has a little bit of everything. My favorite  was the brisket, ribs and red beans.  So good!  It was a lot of food.  I was very full.  We couldn't finish everything.  Some people took some food home.  The restaurant is bit of a small space.  Bench seating so a bit cozy.  The bill came out to be $25 plus tax plus tip.  As usually there is an 18% gratuity for large groups.  Eating BBQ is good once in a while not everyday.  This is a real BBQ joint."}
{"text":"Great Carolina pulled pork! Tasty drinks and a good atmosphere. Service could've been a little better with the amount of people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm always looking out for a great BBQ joint here in Toronto, so it was inevitable that I'd make my way to Smoke Signals.  We arrived around lunchtime on a Saturday and the place was completely empty. Nevertheless we took a seat at a bunch and perused the extremely spare lunch menu.  I quickly landed on the El Chapo (\"brisket, pulled pork, sausage, slaw\"). And when it arrived, it sure looked great (and hearty). But one bite told me that looks can be deceiving. It's not a terrible sandwich by any means; the barbecue sauce is quite tasty and the whole thing was assembled quite well (ie it didn't fall apart after two bites). But it was in the meat that the El Chapo let me down, as it was all just so dry and tasteless. There was a lot of chewing involved, lets put it that way. (There wasn't a hint of smokiness, either, which is par for the course with Toronto BBQ joints, admittedly.)  But the accompanying fries were good, at least. And I should also mention that my dining companion, who got a different sandwich, enjoyed his meal a lot more than I did mine."}
{"text":"Was here with 3 friends and we ordered the Hundo P to share.  They were out of a few things (ribs and bbq chicken) as we came a bit later in the evening.  However from the recommendations from our server were great!  We got the wings with the lemon pepper and it was absolutely delicious.    My only issue with the place is the rather dark lighting.  It was not easy to see my friends even though we were at the same table."}
{"text":"So, being from Texas I am a harsh judge of BBQ places in Toronto.  That being said, this is hands down the absolute BEST BBQ place in the GTA.  From the brisket to the pulled pork and the hush puppies and collard greens you cannot go wrong.  The price points are spot on for the quality of food.  The service is friendly but not over-the-top.  The space is typical BBQ joint feeling.  And the food is true Texas style BBQ.  Would recommend this place to anyone and everyone I meet.  LOVE!"}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper at Smoke Signals Barbecue.  We ordered a few things and shared ... beef brisket (fatty), pulled pork (with the BBQ sauce on the side), smoke wings (with the sauce on the side) and mac 'n cheese.  Gord's not a fan of sauce so that's why we got them on the side.  The pulled pork was moist and flavourful and didn't need the BBQ sauce that would have been mixed in.  Everything was good and we took a bit home.  Gord also got some smoked pepperettes to take home.  Shada was our server.  She was friendly and helpful and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ. The \"Hundo P\" is more than enough for 4-5 people to share - the only thing it's missing is the ribs. As well, this place probably had the best mac n' cheese I've ever had. Good for small groups!"}
{"text":"Easily the best brisket I've ever had in my life.    Went to Smoke Signals last night with a group of five and ordered the Hundo P.  We got to try all meats available, including a jalapeño cheddar sausage they had as a special for the day which was definitely a highlight.  The brisket was the star.  However trying the chicken and pulled pork with the amazing in house BBQ sauce were close seconds.    Not done yet - with the platter came 4 sides - we stuck with the refreshing slaw and collards but added in the must have frito pie and mac and cheese to round out dinner.  It's great that a smokehouse has almost perfected their authentic Texas sides as well.    Their namesake house lager was just right to pair with the smoked meats.    They change up every night - but definitely ask for dessert - their buttermilk lemon pie was off the charts.  Overall smoke signals is a unique experience that the city was waiting for.  We went at 7 and everything was available, but their most popular items do start to sell out.  So get their early and you'll leave happy!"}
{"text":"Came here expecting some awesome BBQ. Came out here disappointed.   Ordered the holy trinity and split it between bf and a friend. It was alright. Nothing offered on that platter stood out to me and nothing I would ever want to try again.  The beans weren't very flavourful. The potato salad was meh. The brisket was DRY (???). The mac and cheese was good, but not $9 as a side good (wtf?). I'd probably pay up to $4-$5 for it.   I think the only items I would THINK about trying again is the pulled pork, which honestly still isn't even that memorable. Maybe the sausage. Which was actually decent.  And holy mama, it is not worth the price! No wonder it was empty when we came in. The food is nothing to write home about.   STACK is many times better than this place for some quality BBQ with all the fixings at a similar price.  Avoid this place unless you're completely okay with mediocre BBQ."}
{"text":"What's the perfect way to celebrate a day for Turkey... beef!  I've often walked by the store and finally got my chance to try it out.  I've had some really good BBQ when I worked in Dallas so I was hoping this would keep with my past experiences.  Walking in feels like a good ol' rustic feel that calls up 'country bbq' in your mind.    The place is clean and though there is a big window in the front, it rarely lets in the light beyond the front room.  When I went they organized the front area to be 3 really large tables (8+) so it can fit a big group.  There were 3 wait staff moving about and though it wasn't busy, we did have to flag them down and they weren't the most communicative.  We decided to get their 1 person brisket platter with a side of cheddar jalapeno sausage.  This would a $30+ meal all in.  The cool thing is that they have a very sturdy big box for take out and they do wrap everything or give a small plastic container to hold it.  Minor rant but it would be good to include napkins and utensils as part of the take out.  We got none and that sucked.    Brisket - I would say that the brisket just warm when it was handed to us so if you're gonna travel a bit far to your place to it, it's gonna be barely above room temp.  We got a fatty piece and it was very tender but I found it low on flavour.  it was just tender sponge... very light on smoke or beefy flavour.  The BBQ sauce had to be used to give it any flavour.  3/5    Cheddar Jalapeno Sausage -  This was interesting... the cheddar cheese oozes out as you take bites.  Its greasy but has a decent flavour.  For $8 a link... it feels a bit pricey but it is a decent size.  3.5/5  Potato salad & coleslaw - Potato salad was a good dill rendition that wasn't too creamy and had a good chunks.  The coleslaw was a different take as it had a lot of pineapple chunks that made the whole salad very sweet.  Unique and perhaps not my favourite... I like the sour bite with the occasional apple thrown in if I really wanted sweetness.  3/5  Overall, it's not bad but I wouldn't say this is a solid choice for BBQ especially when you have other options not too far away."}
{"text":"Smoke Signals is finally a brick and mortar restaurant! Now you can get your BBQ on without waiting for their next pop-up! Only thing is you better arrive early before their signature dishes run out! I'm talking about the brisket but even items like ribs and pulled pork get gobbled up early by their loyal hungry customers so be forewarned!"}
{"text":"Not overrated. Not weird that it's not \"piping hot.\" BBQ is smoked all day and as such is warm, not hot. Portions are rather big, prices more than fair, and service excellent. Very nice restaurant too. They should consider putting sauces on the tables instead of what they're currently doing. People expect a bunch of sauces in a sticky caddy on the table and it's a fun part of getting this type of food. Annoying to have to ask--and then ask again when you invariably don't get enough--for everyone involved, probably mostly for the servers. Brisket is fantastic (tried to add 100 emoji but I guess yelp doesn't do emojis). A very good place, as authentic as it gets for a city that doesn't naturally have this culture."}
{"text":"This place is OVER-RATED!!!  Pros: - good portion sizes (huge ribs!) - modernish deco - clean washrooms  Cons: - food was slightly warm - not hot (come on, warm BBQ?) - flavours not that remarkable, needs a kick - service was inattentive, had to ask for BBQ sauce  Would I go again? Probably not."}
{"text":"I wanted some great BBQ Ribs, and so I thought I'd try this place out. Unfortunately - I regret doing so. The restaurant was busy, but there were tons of free tables and so I thought it would be a great place, and my gosh did it smell amazing. Unfortunately, the service was sub-par.  The waitress sighed, rolled her eyes and was unpleasant when she asked what I wanted to drink, and when I asked for a Cider on the menu - they were all out, and mentioned she only had 1 Beer bottle left and to take that if I wanted something off the menu. I just stuck with water as nothing else on the menu seemed like it was in stock.  Come dinner, I ordered the ribs and half chicken only to be told that at 8pm... they were OUT OF CHICKEN? 8pm? How could that be? Fine, so we took the ribs.  They came out so quickly, that I was sure they were just sitting there on a warming plate, as describing them as \"warm\" would be an overstatement. I won't complain about the ribs, as they were very large, but not very saucy at all (which is how I like them) but I know that's preference. If you are looking for terrible service, a tiny selection of foods and beverages (they couldn't even make me a Long Island Iced Tea), and saucy ribs - this is not the place for you. Will definitely, definitely not be returning back here again."}
{"text":"HOLYYYY. Tonight my friends Jover, Christina and David took me to SmokeSignals BBQ, which is owned by a fellow AE86er named Nick.   The BeefBrisket here is the SOFTEST, most tender brisket I've ever had in MY LIFE, and I've eaten A LOT of brisket from all over the United States, even Texas and the Dirty South.   The brisket doesn't come with any sauce, it's just a bad ass dry rub. Soooo good!  When you try to pick it up with a fork, their brisket falls apart like the interior of a 1980s American car.   Damnnn, I can't wait to come back and I'm still sitting here.  # #YelpToronto #EatToronto #The6ix"}
{"text":"look, i'm a pretty forgiving food enthusiast. but do wrong by some ribs, and my generosity disappears. i had greens, 1/2lb ribs, and a beer for $30 after tip. that's p expensive for some meat that you still have to pull off the bone with your teeth and some leaves.   i know ppl who love this place tho, so maybe try for yourself? idk. maybe it was an off day? i was so depressed that i'd wasted a good appetite that i came home and ate another meal after."}
{"text":"came here the other night for some dinner, and I was salivating at the mouth just from the smell from the parking lot. when we arrived into the establishment I couldn't help but notice how dark everything was and how loud everyone was from just from the ambiance of conversation. right away we were greeted and brought to the very back of the restaurant right by the kitchen, it was dark but very quiet which was perfect. taking a look at the menu can be a bit confusing and I would later learn this when I went to order. I went for the chicken, the pork and mac and cheese. when I ordered I was promptly corrected that the chicken and pork were not just pieces but on a sandwich, that's totally fine with me. the food came and it was pretty majestic looking...small in portions, but majestic. I was quickly given a run down on the hot sauces, green = jalapeno and red = habanero. the green jalapeno's flavor was off the charts for depth and flavor, HUGE fan of it, the habanero was good, but not \"extremely\" hot as it was \"sold\" to me. all of the food that I ate at dinner was absolutely outstanding, from both sandwiches and fries, to the side order of mac and cheese. my only complain about everything was the portion size, would love to come back and grab a platter or something. I decided as well to grab the pie of the day, which ended up being blueberry, wasn't a fan of the crust/pastry but the filling was fantastic with a lemony bite to it.  the service was outstanding, as the lady serving my friend and I was super bubbly and very quick with the food delivery and taking away plates/trays. very impressed.   parking is available in some common municipal lots around the area. transit options are the 505 Dundas streetcar/bus and the 29 Dufferin/63 ossington  cant wait to come back."}
