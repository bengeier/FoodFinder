{"text":"Ordered food for delivery and all 3 meals were missing items. Both pitas were missing sides and dressing for salad was incorrect. When I called to get corrected they offered to have me drive over to pick it up.  Not  cool when I already paid for delivery. Instead of offering help the owner was just rude and hung up. Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This place has seriously changed! When they first opened they used REAL fruit and veggies in there smoothies to make it authentic like Jamba Juice now they use fruit concentrate in the smoothies!!! They were out of spinach and kale and the kid who was working didn't even pour out all of the smoothie from the blender even when I ask him too!!! Don't waste your money and time. The change they made was a major mistake just to save $$on the real thing. So disappointing and fake!"}
{"text":"The idea is nice, but the rest leaves much to be desired.   One worker at 530p on a weekday left us waiting and waiting. We waited probably 10 min to place an order, and 20 to get our food/beverages.   The boba is gross. It's definitely not fresh. The tea itself isn't great either. My husband's smoothie was okay, but overpriced for the size and quality.   We each got a pita, both were mediocre at best. We split a salad that was unexciting and had a pretty gross vinegarette. Definitely wasn't worth the price for either amount or quality.   If you are going to leave your restaurant shorthanded, and from other reviews this is consistently and issue, your food and drink need to make up for the wait, and justify the price. Here, they certainly do not."}
{"text":"I enjoy having this shop right at my front door of my home (walking distance) , the smoothie was great and flavorful, cost was reasonable for the size, and the breakfast pita was yummy!  Now how to get in contact with the owner or managers is anther thing, especially when trying to communicate business propositions for THEIR business! I'll change to 5stars if I can get some full on communication."}
{"text":"Great pitas, and the number 2 smoothie is the best best. Clean and good customer service."}
{"text":"I got a large smoothie (number 3 I wanna say) and a cupcake. Cupcake was okay but the smoothie still has giant chunks of ice in it. It really has no flavor and about an hour later its still  pretty much ice. I can't speak for the food since I didn't get any but I figured the smoothies would be great. Not worth it at all."}
{"text":"I'm only giving 4 stars because my order was incorrect. I was the only person in the cafe and I ordered my smoothie and a Baja Chicken Salad to go. The gentleman went as far as asking if I wanted my chicken served hot or cold over my salad. My smoothie was perfect but I was surprised when I got home to eat what I thought was a salad, ended up being a pita. Not a Baja Chicken Pita but a Chicken Cesar Pita. I mean it's a wonderful tasting pita but I was so confused how my order was mixed up if I was the only person in there. Maybe check your to go orders? I'll be back, hopefully to order and leave with a salad."}
{"text":"Great service and great smoothie! Owner is full of suggestions. As far as smoothies go I think the banana is their best. Definitely going back, great service is hard to come by and much appreciated."}
{"text":"I got the spinach, cucumber and banana smoothie. It was really good. But, It tasted really sweet, especially at the end. I can't tell, if they add sugar or coconut water or any other sweetener. If it's sugar free and no coconut water, I will come back. If it has sugar, I don't want any of it."}
{"text":"I tried a sample that they had in the front the other day and it was delicious. They told me it was the number nine with mangle pineapple and orange.  So yesterday I went down there and I ordered a 32 ounce number nine and it did not taste the same. I called the store and spoke with the manager and he told me to come tomorrow and he will take care of it.  I went over there today and I spoke to the manager and he made me another number nine complementary. It tasted awesome.  Very tasty, its a good alternative to my favorite strawberry, banana, pineapple.  I will definitely be back a few times a week for a little pick me up vitamin boost."}
{"text":"Seriously the best smoothies and so healthy. I barely started going this week and have been in there more than 2 times to try a new smoothie and all are extremely delicious and refreshing. This is definitely my new to-go-to place. Love it!!!!"}
{"text":"First and probably last visit.  I should have written this review when the visit was fresh in my mind, however, I don't this this would have made a difference as the visit was not very memorable.  I had a jerk chicken pita.  There was hardly any meat on it.  The taste was just ok.  I also sampled a smoothie and it was super sweet.  The place was also lacking atmosphere.  It was like it was part of a franchise but they didn't quite make it to the goal line.  It looked as if they also wanted to market the cafe as an internet spot as well, fail.  There was a hodge podge of computers and most of them were off.  It was very unclear if they were for customer use or not.  Overall, a less than flattering first impression was made by Smoothie Run."}
{"text":"Dropped in here out of curiosity and the homemade Hummingbird Cake attacked and wouldn't let me leave until I devoured half of it and swore my allgience to the bird. Wow! Best cake I ever had! Very generous piece for $3.99 and worth every cent. Tasted a kale smoothie and a peach one that they had out for samples. Both were delicious. Very much a community atmosphere and great service from the 2 young people behind the counter. I'll definitely be back. Nicely done, Smoothie Run! We Laveenites have been waiting for you a long time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot, especially since they deliver between 11am - 2pm.  Their pitas are awesome and their smoothies are amazing.  Their customer service client centered and they even go the extra mile if they make an error (which doesn't happen often).  Marcus and the crew are a shining example of what good service and a good \"grab-n-go\" meal should be."}
{"text":"Love it! My boyfriend and I go there about 4-5 times a week. The smoothies are really good, the employees are really friendly and it's all reasonably priced.  I really enjoy the buffalo chicken pita. It's a cool little place. Nice atmosphere. Bright and happy, that's for sure.   I noticed that somebody commented on the paint scheme. I'm just not quite sure how that has any effect on the business or the employees?... but it's bright and catches your attention!  The owner is really nice and checks in on our food and drinks whenever he's in. Yeah, sometimes it's busy and you have to wait... big deal? It's called life. If you're really going to complain over a wait or a line... you should probably just shelter yourself for life.  It's totally worth a shot! Everyone has their bad days. Probably shouldn't judge it just from one bad experience.  Try the #23, mango, blueberry and kale... it's amazing!"}
{"text":"I've had the #16 spinach and pear smoothie with a multivitamin boost twice now. It's really refreshing and tasty. It's right up the street from my house and I'll be coming here more often.  It's right next door to the Halal restaurant I reviewed not too long ago. It's been empty both times I've been here, so I hope more locals come in and support this place. Only negative I guess is that the computers here look pretty janky, but I don't come to surf the web.  There's free WiFi, so if you do want to surf, maybe bring your own laptop.  This place does seem like a good spot to hang out and work on the internet, all of the chairs are very comfortable.  Hopefully, soon, I'll be able to try their wraps and salads.  The caesar salad wrap looks very tempting.  The only reason I don't go for 5 stars is just kind of the low budget feel of everything, old computers and kind of shoddy construction on the tables, etc."}
{"text":"I am only talking about the smoothies when I rate this spot. That was all I purchased. Me and my family went in there and after a 30 minute wait with only one person in front of us, the smoothie was terrible. It was completely watered down as if it was only made with fruit and half melted ice.  Needless to say I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today, and I wish I had checked it out sooner. They use real fresh fruits and vegetables in their smoothies, and they have anything you could want. For the base you can use juice, yogurt, or almond milk. I got a smoothie with spinach, pineapple, mango, and avocado with almond milk as the base. May sound weird but it was delicious - similar to the one Tropical Smoothie Cafe has. Also every 8 smoothies you get a free smoothie, just give them your phone number. Add your email and get another punch."}
{"text":"Love this place, JUST moved to this neighborhood and I'm so glad this is down the street from the gym and my home.  Staff is super friendly and nice, their kale mango is so good!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place. However, I placed an order on Uber Eats and it was an extreme disappointment. They made my Pita incorrectly, the order was missing the chips, and the rice crispy treat was awful. The only decent item was their fruit salad. And even that was just subpar. This place lacks good customer service and lacks an eye for detail."}
{"text":"Nice alternative to all the fast food places in Laveen. Lots of places to sit and use up all that wifi! I got the veggie pita (plus turkey) and built my own smoothie. As with all smoothies you can make them as healthy as you want- low/high sugar, fruits/vegetables, protein, energy boosts, etc. Pita was good, pretty big, but it had way too many bean sprouts on it. I love my veggies but the mountain of sprouts was a little ridiculous. Looking forward to going back and trying some of the other pitas other reviewers have raved about!"}
{"text":"Officially obsessed! Yesterday I tried the #9 smoothie and loved it! Today I ordered their combo that's around $9. It came with a pita, smoothie and side (I forgot to get my fruit side). The smoothie I'm having today is strawberry, kale, banana, with almond milk.... Amazing!! Thanks so much for bringing a healthy place to Laveen!"}
{"text":"I wouldnt say this place was the worst but it definitly wasnt the best. Guy behind the counter was not friendly at all. I got a smoothie and a pita and got charged 14 dollars for it. That wasnt the issue. The pita had shredded up lunchmeat, big chunks of red onion, and the romaine mix lettuce you see at walmart on a giant dry pita. No sauce at all to help it. The smoothie was all concentrate and despite me getting a peach mango kiwi smoothie he did not put in the kiwi. On the way out i saw what i ordered plus a bag of chips for around 9 dollars. Which is way cheaper than what i paid and the cashier said nothing. I also found it wierd how they magically had my phone number after me paying without them even asking for it. Cute place but..... man with a menu that big its just ridiculous. Over 50 items i would have been there all day reading that menu! Wont be going back. I wasted 14 dollars on something i could have made at home"}
{"text":"#9 pineapple, mango, orange. One of the things I really really like about this spot is that the base is a fruit purée instead of dairy products. However If you prefer that it's an option as well.   Super kid friendly and free wifi and computers/tablets. Although I didn't grab lunch there are plenty of healthy looking items in the menu.   I would recommend the smoothies for sure. Staff is friendly and the establishment is clean."}
{"text":"Smoothie Run is a great addition to Laveen because of the healthier options. They also reach out to local schools, which is appreciated. The chicken used in the jerk chicken pita is not that flavorful and processed, so that was disappointing. I also tried the mango, pineapple, and smoothie which was good but for price less concentrate and perhaps more frozen fruit would be better. The service is extremely slow if you happen to go during lunch time and only one person is working. The young lady who was there was kind. She had to juggle doing the cash register and making the orders as they backed up."}
{"text":"Dang it, I really wanted to like this place!  I moved out to Laveen about a year ago, and even though it has its occasional issues, I LOVE Laveen!  I really like it here, so when I see a place that is local I want to go there and support local business.  I saw Smoothie Run advertised on one of Laveen's Facebook pages yesterday and we decided to go today.  Raspados are delicious!  And growing up near the border, I know what a good one tastes like.  This was NOT a good one!  Not just because of our drinks either.  First off, there are young kids working at this place, good for the owner to hire local kids.  But they are obviously not trained well.  And after a few minutes of the employee not being able to figure out how to ring us up he asks a slightly older employee to help.  She comes over to help and someone else (I assume the manager or owner because he was the only adult there) yells at the girl to \"go on\" and shooed her away.  The guy fumbles for a while longer but with the little time she was able to help, most of our order was entered.  We paid.  He fumbled, and it took way too long, but we paid.  Not one other employee acknowledged us.  Then 2 of the 4 employees that were there made our drinks together.  2 drinks and we were in there for well over 10 minutes.  The older guy left, leaving 3 employees.  We got our drinks and left, and as soon as we got in the car my 12 year old said her strawberry raspado tasted like alcohol smells.  I tasted it and the fruit had fermented.  I took it back in, explained to them what happened.  The older (maybe young adult) kid said, well, we put it on ice so I don't know what happened.  I asked more questions...   Me:How long does the fruit stay out?   Employee: we leave it out from open to close but it is on ice. Me:  How often do you change the fruit throughout the day? Employee: whenever we run out.  I mean, we can't tell when the fruit goes bad so thanks for coming in and telling us, we do put it on ice.  Umm, I'm pretty sure there are food regulations and rules for restaurants that specifically tell you how long to leave food out.  And, having something on ice doesn't mean that the whole thing stays cold.... Just the part that is touching the ice.    I won't go back.  I can't trust that their food is safe and properly handled- that sucks!  And I don't like the way the guy treated his employees and he didn't even acknowledge us as customers.  Bad business practice and bad food do not belong in Laveen."}
{"text":"What a great find!!!! Owners are great, very nice and very friendly. The smoothies are amazing! I had a smoothie with kale, strawberries, and peach and it was one of the best smoothies that I've ever had. They also had gyros and other snacks here as well. Super awesome vibe! It's also a free computer bar! They also had computers that you can use and that your kids could play on!"}
{"text":"We are in town for a wedding and didn't want to have a heavy lunch so we stopped by smoothie run for a hot pita and smoothie to share. The service was awesome! The woman who took our order was so sweet and helpful. I'm a little sad we don't have something like this back in Corvallis, Oregon! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Totally awesome and super friendly staff. The let me call in my order ahead of time and i just walk in and pay and leave with a delicious nutritious start to my day."}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast and lunch. I ordered a breakfast pita with bacon, sausage, egg, and cheese and i really enjoyed it.  I went back a couple days later and ordered a Baja chicken pita and I have to say I'm pretty disappointed. My pita is literally dripping sauce, and although the sauce is pretty tasty, it is WAY too much. I've taken out the green mix and added my own but I just can't enjoy it.  On a plus note, both my smoothies were awesome."}
{"text":"luv this place!!!! awesome place with awesome food!!! i wiill be a loyal and frequent customer! !!! highly recommend this place! !!"}
{"text":"Last night I had the ham and turkey club pita....It was delicious....As I waited with my son for food he had found a kids area with stocked with coloring books and toys...what a great idea...will definitely be returning in the future!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today to get a salad.  Only 1 person working and it was busy.  Tried to pay with my credit card and it was not accepted (although I had just used 10 min prior).  I ordered the Southwestern Salad with chicken to go.  Per the menu it should come with: Romaine lettuce, chicken, corn, black beans, roasted pepper mix, colorful tortilla chips with their southwestern sauce.  MY salad was missing the corn, black beans and roasted pepper mix."}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience here! We were the only ones in the store and it took probably 20 minutes for them to make 2 8oz smoothies, a sandwich and a veggie pita. Neither the sandwich or veggie pita had any dressing/condiments on them, and there were no chips given with the sandwich. Our smoothies were supposed to be 12 oz and we're given to us in water cups, not even full. One of the smoothies had flax seed substituting granola (because they were out) and we were charged an extra dollar. They didn't even give us kids that fit, so we took our smoothies home hoping they didn't spill. We paid $25 and didn't even receive half of what we ordered. There were three employees and only one of them was working, and they were out of basic ingredients like bananas which are in most smoothies. We won't be back.  Edit: my pita is hard, and it turns out they close in a few minutes so the absent employees just didn't want to work and we couldn't go back to complain anyway. Edit 2: Added a star, as the owner refunded us and asked for more information."}
{"text":"I love Pitas, so I tried the Jerk Chicken.  I loved the mango sauce on top.  I had the pear/Gorgonzola salad another day.  I just wish the pears were fresh they seemed like they were from a can, but other than that, it was really good and I will be back.  I tried a sample of their raspberry smoothie (forget which number), I don't usually like raspberry, but it was really good mixed in the smoothie.  I can't remember which smoothie I tried bc there were so many I wanted to try, but it was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I had a smoothie here the other day and I thought it was awesome. I think it was the number 3. It was strawberry, banana, pineapple. They had some sample with some mango in it and my 3 year old son could not stop eating it while we waited."}
{"text":"My kids and I come here every couple of weeks. The smoothies are so yummy! I haven't tried the food here yet, but it looks good! The employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is so cute, you can tell they are really trying out here in Laveen.  They have the benefit of being the only somewhat-healthy place around, but their food is seriously lacking.  Yes, I  know the place is called \"Smoothie Run,\" but they do tout lunch specials which include a smoothie and a salad.  The salad choices are pretty limited.  The employee recommended the chicken caesar but I went with the BBQ chicken salad, and to put it nicely - it was mediocre.  The \"grilled\" chicken strips tasted like they came straight out of the bag and heated in a microwave.  The dressing was a bbq sauce that completely overwhelmed the whole salad. The smoothie I ordered (peanut butter banana) was just fair.  The employees were very friendly and helpful, so that was a plus. I'm not in Laveen very often, but if I find myself down south again, I may swing by and try another smoothie (fruit-based this time), but I'll skip the food, it really left a bad impression :-("}
{"text":"Ordered the combo: pita, smoothie and side. All were horrible. After a few bites and sips I threw everything away. Nothing tasted fresh. The smoothie tasted like concentrate, sugar, water and ice. I bought a groupon that has 2 vouchers. I probably won't go back with the second voucher.  Disappointed"}
{"text":"Smoothie Run is a cute little place where you can select something more healthy than a burger and fries. It offers an Internet cafe and the prices are reasonable.  The menu offers smoothies, sandwiches, salads, chips and soup. I ordered a chicken ceased pita that came with kettle chips, cup of tomato basil soup and a water. Although it had good taste, the chicken had the texture of being processed and formed.   The staff was friendly and upbeat, and the place bright, colorful and clean.  The also offer delivery via Grubhub."}
{"text":"So I have been to this place twice. My first experience was amazing, so today I was going to take my fiance. I got the kale, blueberry and mango. Got in the car with my smoothie and took a big sip to find out they put peanut butter in my smoothie (mind you, I have deadly peanut butter allergy). Had to bust ot the ol' benadryl and hoping i dont need to use my epipen. The guy taking orders didn't even have a answer why he put the peanut butter..."}
{"text":"This place looked heathy and there isn't much around here. But there is only one person working and over 30 min for a quick salad?! Never again"}
{"text":"Stopped by at 12:30pm and there was only one employee working. This is a busy time and it took 10mins to order. Then 30+ mins till we received the order as she was still fulfilling the previous orders. Hire more employees please! Smoothie Run you used to be a great spoke for lunch."}
{"text":"Great little spot. I highly recommend the combo with a kale and mango smoothie, spicy jerk chicken pita and fruit"}
{"text":"In this horrid laveen area filled with fat cancer causing foods I'm so happy to have this little smoothie / health food. It's really hard to get vegan smoothies area the Phx area let alone laveen. Anyone who isnt super pleased probably is use to prepackaged service from McDonald's. Making a fresh smoothie takes about 10 - 15mins I had a smoothie that I made myself and it was pretty good. The great thing about it is they will add things to your specifications! I will be walking over today"}
{"text":"Very unhappy... I got the hummus cold pita, which was the same price ($7.25) as the chicken Caesar pita, and other pitas with meat on them.  I asked how much to add chicken - $1.95 - so I skipped that.  When I got back to the office, I opened my pita - which is supposed to have avocado -it did, but 3 small pieces; and the hummus, was literally a spread, like mayo on the pita.  The pita was not fresh.    There was only one person working - and during lunch hour??  I spent almost $8.00, didn't get a good meal, and will NEVER go back.  I would give it 0 stars."}
{"text":"Brand new Internet cafe that has a great setup, they serve pitas, salads, and smoothies. The smoothies are amazing! I used to go to Jamba Juice all the time but now I will be having my smoothies locally and supporting a local business"}
{"text":"I love this place! Smoothies are huge and tasty and the pulled pork pita is delicious."}
{"text":"Love the smoothies and the atmosphere. Plenty of computers to hop on, even has a tv with a little lounge area for kids. Average prices as far as smoothies go. I've only had the chicken Caesar pita (which is huge) but I wouldn't really considerate it a \"go to\" food spot. Breakfast sounds good if I ever get up for it. Lots of yummy icecream choices and they deliver!"}
{"text":"Love it! the smoothies are healthy and delish! so nice to have a healthy option in Laveen!!!!"}
{"text":"Smoothie run is close to home so we stopped by one weekday for a quick lunch. Just a few others there and many who come in and do take out. I ordered their 2 slices of pizza and a fruit smoothie (note to self: don't get the pizza again. It tastes like cheap box frozen pizza, just skip it.) However, the smoothie was great. I'm happy to see they actually are using real ingredients and not a ton of sugared concoctions, my strawberry, banana, pineapple, almond milk sugar was just that. I also like you can add things to it like protein powder and choose your milk type or juice so an A+ for their smoothie selections. Also, an A+ for their potato salad, my friend got a chicken wrap that looked very filling and delicious and she gave me her potato salad so yay for me :) We'll be back. I'll be getting a wrap next time and trying some of their other smoothies. Also, girl at counter takes your order, answers phone, and makes your food so be patient! She was great :)"}
{"text":"I went when they were open for several months, hopefully in time for them to have ironed out any snaffus.. Wrong. The experience was mediocre at best, and I found the atmosphere laughable. They could have used a consultant for interior ideas and definitely should have splurged on NEW, MATCHING computer equipment. The machinery was all old and refurbbed-looking, and all mismatched. For a place labeling itself as an internet cafe, this i pretty comical.   The smoothie was subpar. I opted for a pretty basic strawberry-banana-pineapple blend and was shocked when I saw concentrates being pumped into my cup from the back. I'm totally cool with frozen fruits used in smoothies, but concentrates? Oh hell naw.   The server was not very personable and looked disheveled. Very much so less than professional. He wasn't unfriendly, he wasn't rude.. Just kind of robotic.   We probably wont go back. It was a lot of money to drop on a smoothie made from concentrate."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good, excited to have this place and hope it does well as its a nice alternative to all the fast food crap that plagues Laveen.  We need more places like this.  I will definitely support them.  We enjoyed the pita, salads and smoothies.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Always friendly. Smoothies are good and the pitas as light and filling. So glad I have a decent smoothie place in Laveen now."}
