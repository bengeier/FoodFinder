{"text":"This is better than average mall food, and I love the cookies and muffins. There oughta be a yellow caution tape around the establishment, though, because its ultra-centralized location forces way too many cream cheese brownie breaks and those clothes I'm trying on are not gonna fit me after all. I do have to wonder if the portions for salads and sandwiches are getting smaller. A customer next to me griped about it to the cashier, and lo and behold, my tasty pasta salad was a little on the chintzy side."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. Three people at the cash register and only one person making the actual orders."}
{"text":"Not that I don't love Paradies because I do, it's just that I will not attend this Paradise ever again. Paradise gets busy, but when you have been waiting for your meal for 30 minutes, and people that arrive after you get their meals before you do, that is a problem. Then to make matters worse, the young girl that worked there gave me a bad attitude for her miscommunication error. She also snapped at her co-worker in the presence of myself and other patrons. That was not professional. She then tried to rectify her mistake (with attitude of course), so I just left, and decided that I would not go back. I use to frequent this locatioin because it is 10 minutes away, but too many times I've had to wait a rediculous amount of time, and watch others that arrive after me, get better service. Needless to say, I will drive to any other Paradise, but this one."}
{"text":"I love the food at Paradise Bakery, but this location can be hit or miss with the quality. I've given up on calling in orders to pick up because the majority of the time they are incorrect, missing items from my meal, or not even made upon my arrival. Recently they extended their business hours, but often are out of items near the end of the day. When the food is good, it is great though. Just gets frustrating with the quality when things aren't prepared right, especially since Paradise isn't cheap."}
{"text":"Worst coffee I've literally ever had ever. And whoever is baking for them needs to take some culinary classes. It was absolutely disgusting and the woman was really really rude to me, and didnt get my order correctly at all and i had to be charged again because she wasnt listening, YOU HAVE ONE JOB LADY!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did.   I've been at Paradise Bakeries in other states and they were always decent places to eat, but not this one.   S-L-O-W.   And expensive for what you get.  Their coffee comes from a pump pot.   Their tea... they give you a cup and point you to a counter with a hot water tap and some tea bags.  If you order a specialty coffee -- allow minimum 15 minutes (one time it took 30 minutes to get one Chai tea.)   And it wasn't busy.   Workers sort of hanging out, but not taking care of customers, the few customers they had.   Been there three times and it's always a frustrating experience.   What this place needs is a good dose of supervision, and that's sad in a \"Who is John Galt\" sort of way.  If you're in this area and looking for some good coffee/tea, I recommend you to try Hava Java, about 10-12 minutes away on the NW corner of Camelback & 32nd St.   It does get busy, but they have better coffees and teas, and really good service.  I discovered Hava Java here on Yelp, and all the user hype was dead on.  Their house tea is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery is AMAZING!! I love that place and love their food. They have many different healthy items to choose from. They have great service and it's never over the top packed."}
{"text":"I hate this Place....Seriously, I can not go here with out a Cookie.... Love The Thai Chicken Salad & Tomato soup, That's my go to meal. If you love the Club Sandwich, just have them add cranberry, you'll love me later.  This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. They ran out of the soup we ordered. We had to wait 5 minutes. Not a big deal and didn't complain. Next thing we know they are asking us for our credit card and receipt so they can give us a full refund. Very unexpected and very nice."}
{"text":"Our meals came without the cookies. When I asked the server she said, \"Oh yeah, we are out of chocolate chip cookies.\" It was 11:15am on a Sunday. When I asked \"All day?!\" the server said \"Well, yeah.\" What? How is this possible? Go bake more. Seems to be a common theme at Paradise Bakeries as of late, though. Never make enough product and run out by late afternoon. Didn't think we would have this problem at lunch time, however."}
{"text":"Always love a good sandwich and soup, but Paradise Bakery clearly disappoints.  We had the half soup/salad and sandwich.   The French Onion Soup was very average, the  chicken on focaccia was  sub-standard, and was surprised that the focaccia bread was underbaked.  I had the Thai Chicken Salad...which to me was a step up from a McDonalds salad and the Pannini (Cuban) was over done.  I have generally had their muffins and baked goods as a take out and they have always been excellent but there are far better places to spend your money on a soup/salad and sandwich."}
{"text":"My mom and I ate here tonight for dinner, just wanting something quick and easy, both just had soup, it was 7:15 when we were eating, 45 mins til they closed, and 3 or 4 employees started sweeping and mopping, doing closing duties, which is fine although strange to start the closing process when you still have 40 minutes and guests still coming in..anyway, all the employees start shouting at each other from across the restaurant and just being really rude and inconsiderate of the fact that people were trying to enjoy their dinner and relax. The worst of all was the loud mouthed manager who was all but yelling at his employees to sweep there, mop here. So I was annoyed and asked them if they could stop yelling so we could eat our dinner without yelling and shouting and going on. They said yeah sure except some girl Joyce (pretty sure that was her name) made a snarky smart-a$$ remark that I didn't quite catch because her coworker friend said \"Joyce be quiet\" anyway, just a crappy experience with mediocre overpriced food and a loud manager and rude employees. P.S. Joyce-don't work in customer service if you are going to be rude, also the girl who took our order was extremely sweet and professional, think her name was Kayla."}
{"text":"It never ceases to frustrate me that restaurants which offer potentially vegetarian and vegan menu choices insist on defeating that option by creating the food with animal derived / based ingredients... for instance, Panera, er, Paradise Bakery offers up six soups on a daily basis- typically at least one of them is labeled vegetarian safe, however, selections such as Fire Roasted Tomato, French Onion and Baked Potato, one imagines being able to order those soups- which would otherwise be vegetarian- yet are not- because they're made with chicken or beef stock. Yes, soup base holds together better when they're made with chicken or beef stock (and arguably tastes better), but any reasonably good chef can make a soup base with vegetable stock and still provide the same results... not to mention opening up more menu items to a larger consumer group (more revenue anyone?) Grrr... Are you listening, Panera... er, Paradise Bakery?"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this location when you are wanting to go to Paradise. Staff is not great, to say the least. They are not accommodating. They seem put off by the simplest of questions. I was very disappointed. I have gone to other Paradise locations where the staff went above and beyond and was so wonderful. I hope they do something about the awful customer service here (or lack thereof)"}
{"text":"Why does the bakery keep discontinuing the wild berry smoothie?   It is a great smoothie.   Bring it back!"}

{"text":"I apologize for inconvenience you Port ordering food that Hispanic young man was so rude just threw his food at me like I was a dog"}
{"text":"Randy is the heart of this place, and the reason I keep coming back. He's so genuine and sweet, great at his job, and anticipates needs like nobody I've seen before. All of my experiences have been great when Randy is working, and I'm always glad when he's there."}
{"text":"Medical assistance in a Bakery?  Great bakery service.  I've come here for meetings in the morning about 20 times.  Staff are friendly and you never feel rushed out even when you didn't order anything.  I was with a friend that had some medical problems and ended up on the ground.  Staff came around more than once to help out and to see what else they could do.  Food has always been good and consistent."}
{"text":"Food Quality and Selection - 4 star Atmosphere - 4 star Value - 3 star Overall Experience - 1 star Overall Rating - 1 star   I just tremble each time I walk into this place because their ordering process is so darn convoluted.   On my recent visit there the guy in front of me was departing from his ordering group (I think that's the concept) to come back in the flow to try to put a sandwich on his order.  We did the whole polite 'you go - no you go' thing back and forth and my family ended up ordering next and I felt like I was cutting in front of him.  Were we?     My family then ordered and I then proceeded to order the advertised Chicken Tortellini and Side Salad. We moved down the line and I told the salad person that I just wanted a basic side salad at which point she said 'which one'?   To which I replied 'oh just a basic one here in the photo'.  She then tried to continue to explain the menu to me.   As this conversation evolved, I realized that my Chicken Tortellini - the one that was pictured - was not a soup but a pasta.   After noting this error on my part - I decided I didn't want to have to leave my 'ordering group' to go back to the beginning of the line and ask to barge in to the large group behind us to re-order and the pasta is 'more food' than soup and not wanting to be a glutton asked to cancel the salad.  That then became this huge ordeal as I may have already ordered the salad (did I?) and my wife was like 'well get one if your paying for it!' and I am like 'huh? - that doesn't make sense - I don't want one'.  I spent the rest of the meal trying to explain to my family that Paradise stood nothing to gain in 're-inventing' age old ordering processes.  That their process is fundamentally broken and that I would guarantee that I am not the person with complaints about the process (Yelp is full of these sentiments - btw).  I also explained that common ordering processes are characterized as a set of synchronous processes (where one in the group steps up and completes, the next goes and completes, and so on, and if a change is needed it's made, it is done, and so on, and when you are done, you pay).  The person who designed this for Paradise wanted to achieve efficiencies by designing as what is essentially an asynchronous process where different things in the same order can happen all at once (like when your kids run over to bakery when you are at sandwiches and your wife is trying to order at salads) - and that this does work in cafeteria style ordering processes - but they ended up what seems like somewhere in between.   I would bet that it is as confusing for employees as it is for customers and that employees are probably not even really trained to the process effectively because it is so broken.   As such, the prevailing attitude becomes 'wing it' and it's no big deal and by the time you reach the end of the line the employees and customers end up hating each other.   Then when the next good customer comes through the line, the employee takes out all the prior frustrations of the day on the next victim.   In the end, the employees - who started out as 'good people' - just start to dislike their jobs and their customers a little bit less and less each day - which kills employee retention.   And in the end, the bizarro ordering process makes the whole world a worse-off place to be.     My family, of course, just thought I was making a big scene and made comments like 'Dad - your just getting old and grumpy' and tried to explain the salad ordering processes.  My assertions that this is about much more than a salad order fell on deaf ears and my wife stated was acting like my mother (that is a 'major slam' btw).   The experience is fixable.   Panera has a similar menu/similar concept and I have never had an issue with Panera.   Jason's deli has a similar ordering concept.   In both cases, you figure out what you all want.   Order and pay.   Pick-up some of the food at the end and the rest comes out later.   It's simple, streamlined, and easy to understand.   Alternatively, they could go with the cafeteria style ticketing process.    They need one or the other, but the two don't mix.  Ok - all that being said here is the menu item that brought all of this to a head.  The picture on the web it is more clear that the Paradise item is a pasta and not a soup - but from a distance I was thinking it was a hearty soup.   It's an honest mistake - but one that was clearly compounded in this case by the multi-faceted ordering process.  Chicken Tortellini Alfredo (the item advertised by Paradise as neither soup nor pasta)       http://paradisebakery.com/whatnew_menu_items.php?random=1277419851957.1  Chicken Tortellini Alfredo Soup...       http://allrecipes.com/recipe/tortellini-florentine-soup/"}
{"text":"Love the food here but this location is rarely ever staffed well so it takes a long time to get your food, especially weekend mornings. So if you're in a rush in the morning, you may want to pass. Downside is that there's not a lot of good breakfast places around here so I can't offer an alternative."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've ever been to this place and they were very helpful and nice and courteous. I'm most defiantly coming here on every pay day!!!"}
{"text":"$8 for small bowl of Vermont Mac and Cheese.  Take out a loan, travel to Vermont yourself, or trade in your house.  Worth every penny in bizarro world."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first and last PB visit.  Have heard about it for a while from family and friends of family.  Talked up a lot by young moms in the area.  So why the hate?  First and foremost I was underimpressed by the food.  Not sure what those who rave about it eat normally but for my normal diet, this was nothing special, including the chocolate chip cookies.  The blue cheese crumble salad had a barely perceptible blue cheese flavor.  The pulled chicken in the pasta was sparse and looked like it came from a can.  The ordering process is confusing for first timers and honestly I felt like I was at the deli counter at AJs, Sprouts or Publix.  I went at dinner time and was disappointed that it is mostly lunch-like fare (sandwhich, salad, light pasta, soup).  Was also disappointed that the first three items I tried to order were all 'sold out' for the night.  With such a disappointing selection it didn't leave many options.  It was the opening night of the 2nd Hunger Games movie and the staff blamed it on that.   Considering this PB has been next to the theater for a while you'd think the manager would properly plan for the demand on opening night of big movies that draw in the PB demographic.  This place just doesn't resonate with me and I fail to see the attraction.  Might be just ok for a quick lunch sandwhich."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it is amazing !!! I love their coconut chocolate chip cookies :) I ordered their croissant sandwich with all sorts of meat (kind of like a BLT) and it was sooooo tasty. This particular location can get pretty busy around lunch time so if you're in a rush make sure to give yourself the extra time !! Waiting is so worth it. Prices are average :) highly recommend."}
{"text":"food is hit or miss. This place never seems to have clam chowder.  But the service is awesome.  I usually get the fire roasted tomato soup (kinda tastes like marinara sauce!! lol) and southwest chicken salad. Its alright, not the best things I have ever had.  The cookies are okay, I personally think the one on mayo makes way better cookies and wonderful soup."}
{"text":"This place has taken a turn for the worse if you ask me.   Over the past few months Paradise has changed!   They switched up the menu and it appears that they are making everything at a low low cost.  Salad's used to be great and you got what you paid for. Not any more, they have officially followed the trend on cutting corners and making everything at a lower cost.   Sorry $30 bucks for 2 adults and 1 kid, I expect more.     Example: BBQ chopped chicken Salad, used to be like 6-7 separate ingredients that they mixed in a big bowl and then after a nice toss, placed in a bowl.  It was a great salad!!! Not any more, no more mixing bowls, they mix the ingredients in the small bowl that you get your salad in.   And its only 4 ingredients, salad, corn/black bean mix, dressing, chicken, done! The salad is just...whatever now.  This is the second time in three weeks I have gone back, both times, the salad was disappointing.   Its something new that the company has adopted, no more mixing bowls.  I can understand the cleaning of each bowl can take its toll, but for the amount of money they charge...suck it up Paradise.       Management at this establishment was non existent this evening.  It seemed like no one knew what their responsibility was, again no change from three weeks ago.    The rewards program is good, every 8 entrees you buy you get one free, that's the only thing that keeps me coming back.   And the cookies."}
{"text":"I had the scrambled egg breakfast it was great. Then I bought one of their muffins to take with me for a mid morning snack. My sister had the oatmeal and it is completely gone"}
{"text":"It's owned by Panera. So essentially they have some shared items. They also share the same hefty prices for fairly small portions.  Lets be real here, the illusion of healthy food is all that you are really getting. As other reviewers have said, the cookies melt in your mouth, here's why: they are made primarily of butter. So is everything else in the place including the breads. Everything is very high in calories (even the salads), so if healthy food is your goal you should definitely ask to see their nutrition info first, although if you do you might need to find somewhere else to eat. Avoid the cookies at all costs at nearly 300-400 calories a pop. Yes that's one cookie. Note the grease stain it leaves when you set it on any clean napkin.  That being said, the food is okay. The place is always busy and the staff is nice enough. Salads are usually fresh enough and sandwiches can be customized to your specifications. Bagels and muffins in the morning are usually fresh as well, but stale by the afternoon. Really it's just the illusion of \"healthy\" food that gets me here. One of their \"meals\" is topping 1000 calories if you eat the \"free\" cookie."}
{"text":"Whenever I make a trip out to AZ, I always stop by Paradise for the cookies. The cookies are soo good, even the nibblers."}
{"text":"I work right nearby and have never had an order incorrect in any way. It's always busy, especially this morning, but they work pretty fast and you are never waiting too long. One staffer there named Ciara always remembers my name, what I like to order, etc.. she does an amazing job and so does the entire group. Thanks for all the great lunches!"}
{"text":"I'm not getting what drives so many people into this place.  Went in there because the other restaurants around this place (strip mall) didn't offer any healthier options.  I tried to eat decently so I ordered the Asian Chicken Salad.   Paid $6. Waaaaayyy overpriced.  Got a small bowl of somewhat brown cabbage.  A few crispy noodles.  A few little chunks of chicken and 5-6 edamame.  Nothing to it for $6.  The dressing was decent tasting but paying the prices they get for \"nothing\" does not make me want to come back."}
{"text":"This place is now PANERA. It has gone from bad to terrible. I ordered a turkey/cranberry sandwich on flat bread. The very thinly sliced turkey was gross, smelled bad and tasted terrible. Was with a group so no time to report the problem. But will never go back."}
{"text":"We have utilized Paradise Bakery at Desert Ridge repeated times for treating some of our  referring offices to lunch.  Their catering manager has consistently met all of our needs with good follow through and efficiency."}
{"text":"Dont come here unless you like bland food, indifferent service, all the booths camped out in by businesses conducting loud meetings or singles playing on laptops. The only reason I gave them two instead of one stars is that their bathrooms are very clean"}
{"text":"While the food taste the same here as any other PB, the portion sizes are ridiculously small for what you pay.  I ordered the scrambled egg breakfast for $6.99, it was less than 1 egg with a tiny, tiny cup of fruit, a small piece of toast and was missing the bacon!  It cost them less than a dollar for sure!!!  The yogurt parfait was $4, and was one very small scoop of yogurt a few pieces of granola and 3 berries!  The service is VERY slow, the Manager on duty did NOT look or act like he wanted to be there and SHAME on him for making fun of one of the workers behind her back in customer ear shot!  Disrespectful!!"}
{"text":"Well, I used to love this place.... All last year their soup & sandwich combo was delicious .... This time I went in for there new Turkey Panini & it was HORRIBLE... Bread was soggy, hardly any turkey, couldn't even see any cranberry sauce... It basically SUCKED... So much for Paradise Bakery"}
{"text":"There has been some turn over at this location but I used to come here all the time and the staff was excellent. I can't speak to the recent changes that some people have been experiencing. Within the last year or so they have also done a pretty major overhaul to their menu. If you haven't been to a paradise bakery, it would be worth checking  out if your a fan of their style of fare."}
{"text":"Yum! The line was out the door but it moved quickly and the food was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Second Paradise Bakery I've been to with same problem.  24th street and Camelback in Phoenix is this one.  Ladies' rest room had no toilet paper, seat covers, soap or towels.  Reported it to manager.  (I always have \"supplies\" in my jacket.  He said they check it every 1/2 hour.  DOUBT that all these supplies would be used up in 1/2 hour.  Cannot give it any stars.  I HAD to give it a star, according to your rules, but it deserves NONE."}
{"text":"The coffee cake was so delicious and moist, had tip buy the whole coffee cake to take home.  Coffee it's great food food selections and they prices ate fair."}
{"text":"I enjoy Paradise, but my experience at this location wasn't as positive as other reviewers or compared to other locations I've been to.  I ordered the Roast Beef sandwich with avocado and no horseradish. I received my order and there is horseradish plastered all over the bread and no avocado. A curse word starting with \"F\" was said! Now I have to go back and wait again to get the right sandwich. I know this location is busy, but my order wasn't a hard request to get right. Nothing irks me more when your order is messed up!  My correct sandwich was made within a few minutes and then I enjoyed the sandwich with my cookie. The roast beef sandwich is pretty good, but not quite as good as the Wildflower roast beef sandwich (my opinion). I would eat the sandwich again without hesitation.  The cookies were not as moist and tasty as the other locations I've gone to in Tempe. The outside of the cookie was extremely crunchy and the inside moist (how the cookie usually is). That was a bit disappointing because I think Paradise cookies are awesome.   Maybe this was just an off night. I was just frustrated that the cookies were not the usual awesome cookies and had the hassle of the wrong sandwich order.   Don't fail me next time Paradise..."}
{"text":"Katherine is the best employee. It's not often I find great customer service anymore, and Katherine never ceases to show the best customer service. She's always on a good mood, remembers my name and order, and always takes the time to give information about ingredients and how the loyalty cards work and such. She also never fails to compliment me when I'm paying.  Seriously, give Katherine a raise. She deserves it for constantly being happy in an industry where it's so easy to break down."}
{"text":"I have been to several Paradise Bakeries across the valley, and I am usually very happy with the food and service. So I tried this location thinking that I'd be just as pleased - not the case. There were plenty of staff members,  but no one willing to help. I stood in line for several minutes, watching two staff members chat behind the counter, before even being acknowledged. I ordered a \"pick 2\" (turkey sandwich and soup), with an added cookie. The guy helping me had a major attitude,  and the cashier was acting as if I was an inconvenience to her. I asked for my order to go, and I left. I learned my lesson in not checking my food before leaving,  because when I got home,  I realized that the sandwich was wrong: ham and cheese, not turkey. Also, the soup tasted as if it had been sitting out all day,  and the cookie was as hard as a rock. Such a waste of money.  Never again."}
{"text":"I asked the waiter if this cafe made good bacon and eggs. He assured me it did. Take my advice, have them microwave your flip flop and eat that instead. It would taste a lot better."}
{"text":"We go here at least twice a month (ok, sometimes weekly!).  For those who haven't been here, it is cafeteria style where you walk through and place your order and get a number.  You pay at the cash register and then within a couple of minutes of getting your drink and finding a table, your food comes out to you.  Love their soups and salads and their chicken walnut sandwiches are absolutely amazing.  With most meals, you also get the most decadent chocolate chip cookie - mmmmm!  Great food and customer service."}
{"text":"Half of my grilled cheese was not even grilled ... warm bread on one side. how hard is it to mess up grill cheese?!?!"}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich place in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. The chicken walnut sandwich is great..huge portions. The salads are all great. They have good ice tea and the mini chocolate chip cookies that come with the meal are yummy! I love their cookies..the snickerdoodle, sugar, peanut butter, chocolate chip with nuts..they are all good. You better go early...this place is always packed around the lunch hour."}
{"text":"You know what I'm going to be honest . The food here , absolutely great! But the service , it could be better: at lease In the salad department. They always seem to have an annoyance look on thir face. But all the other areas are super friendly. Don't get me wrong; I'm still gonna come here, because of the food. I just wish they would work on a little more customer service there.  I do definitely recommend the broccoli chedder soup(in a bread bowl) to anyone trying this place out. Super yummy."}
{"text":"Love all the food here.  Steel cut oatmeal is great.  Hibiscus iced tea is also a favorite.  Awesome cookies!  Great service at this location too!"}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery & Café is a enticing quick order sit down restaurant which offers a delicious menu. The overall take on Paradise was well meet for a quick service restaurant."}
{"text":"Blech. This is my 3rd and final visit to this or any Paradise Bakery location. I'm a fan of Panera which is infinitely classier. Here, everything is served in paper bowls with plastic forks and spoons. The cookie I received was very underbaked.  Chaos behind the counter as only one of 3 staffers had any idea of what to do. There was a constant annoying high pitch squealing noise in the restaurant, which hadn't been cleaned or attended to in many hours. Just pitiful all the way around and not worth my $13.43 for a salad, cookie and small iced tea."}
{"text":"Now I know why this place has a 2 rating. Just moved to AZ and was looking forward to an alternative to Starbucks. I've come here every weekday for the last month and I can't tell you how many times the coffee has run out and then I have to wait for it to brew in the back - upwards of 10-15 minutes. This morning takes the cake. I decided on tea and there was only a small amount of water left in the container. I gave it to the counter person to take it to the back and fill it up. She comes back and says she has to wait for the coffee to finish brewing before getting any hot water. It's now been 15 minutes and no hot water. This is the last time!  Einstein Bagels here I come!"}
{"text":"Strawberry, poppy seed, and chicken salad entree was very good.  The employees were very nice as well. I would recommend this Paradise Bakery to anyone looking for a quiet place for a nutritious meal."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and never been super impressed. But today i paid $9 for a sandwich that was covered in rotten avacado!!!! If i hadn't gotten it to go and went straight to work I'd of taken it back, but no time unfortunately :(  how would you not notice that you are loading a sandwich with rotten avacado.  For real though!"}
{"text":"This is basically the same thing as a Panera Bread, so it's nothing special, but not bad either.  Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Clean and friendly.  Although I like Einstein's better for their bagel selections and tastes - Paradise is okay. Nice selection of pastries and coffees. Seems to be very popular with the wi-fi folks."}
{"text":"Thanks Trevon for a fast and friendly service. You have great customer service and we felt very welcoming trying to decide what to eat. You made the whole experience fabulous!!  Thanks."}
{"text":"I went in to get a salad and a sandwich. I did the half salad half sandwich. While the girl was making my salad, she didn't even seem friendly at all. I would ask if she had a specific item and she said yes, but she didn't even put it in my salad. On top of that, when I asked if I get a cookie with my food, the girl said no you do not get it. That is the first time I have heard that. It always comes with it if you get the half and half portions. On top of the my sandwich was awful it didn't even have the lettuce or tomato on it. Everyone working there didn't even seem like they wanted to help me at all. Worst experience."}
{"text":"I go here often. This is my kind of place for a leisurely coffee and roll. Big, open, airy, warm atmosphere. Only downside is it gets too crowded. So find your own place for coffee, this is mine!"}
{"text":"My experience here was pretty much sub par. I came here with my family, we ordered a bunch of coffee and salads, and to our surprise they had run out of coffee. Even after telling the workers there that the coffee had run out, they did not refill the coffee pots during our stay there. A pretty much disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Limited choices of breakfast.   And our orders came in cold. They seemed to run out of people to clean the tables.  My friend added that they always run out of coffee.  I mean, it is definitely not place to start your day but a place for emergency."}

{"text":"Went here for a quick take out dinner of soup and sandwich.  Looks just like Panera Bread, same menu and it is owned by the same company.  My expectations are that I will get what I order for the same quality as Panera Bread.  No.  Great veggie soup as Panera but the sandwiches are not as good.  I ordered a tuna salad sandwich and it looked like it had better days as the bread fell apart when you picked it up.  The cookies are suppose to be the best in the area, however, I don't eat cookies.  I'm going to stick with Panera Breat strictly and give Paradise three stars believing that once they totally transition over, it will improve."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner recently. Very disappointed with the changes. The food was processed and no longer fresh. Children's grilled cheese tasted bad. My child asked for a plain piece of bread because of how bad his food was, they charged us $1.50 for the plain bread after we told them he wouldn't eat his grilled cheese. The soup was bland and salad old. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I am a loyal fan!!!!!   This place is amazing for breakfast or lunch.  Lately I've been going for breakfast more and more.  I love their bagels and cream cheese.  My wife and I like going for lunch as well.  I usually get the pick 2 combo so I can get a sandwich and a soup.    Staff is very friendly and always willing to help."}
{"text":"Looks like a cool place (a lot bigger than it looks on the outside) with a pretty big menu.  Food was pretty average and coffee was as well.  Service was really friendly though."}
{"text":"I'm hooked on this place! I've always encountered friendly people working and never had to wait in line too long. Food is always great! I recently discovered their breakfast menu and love it!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst paradise bakery in Arizona. I always try to give it another try because of the good location, but time and time again it highly disappoints.   The food sucks, very unorganized, ran by a bunch of kids. So bad, and I love paradise bakery.  Dry cookies, wet bread, dirty tables, rude rude employees.  Avoid this place.  So sad because I love paradise and like to visit others often."}
{"text":"Absolutely great food!!!! The soup and sandwiches!!! Love the cookies and pastries!!!! The kids really like it and I love that most of it is healthy for them!! Would take this place over any fast food or pizza any time!!!!"}
{"text":"I got the turkey cranberry and the garden vegetable it was  expensive but so delicious I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my family and it was very busy because it's Sunday afternoon. My food was great but had to wait for someone to clean off the tables. Otherwise this location is always nice and clean."}
{"text":"Great location, but wayyy overpriced! For a Paradise Club Sandwich, small Southwestern Salad, and a cookie it's 18 bucks! And that's not including a drink! Three stars for that reason. Other than that it's always clean and the employees are always nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"When I travel to Phoenix for work I always hit this place up.  They have the absolute best cinnamon rolls I've ever had in my life!  They are huge, have tons of creamy topping, and they even heat it up for you.  Their quiche is also very tasty, along with their southwest breakfast wraps.  Their tuna sandwiches are decent but not worth $7 IMO.  They also have very soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies.  Decent coffee too."}
{"text":"Need to watch out for un-asked for upgrades. Read the menu carefully. Be sure to check the bill."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Wouldn't recommend the unsweetened tea though, it's a bit bitter."}
{"text":"Ate there yesterday, I love the vegetarian sandwich and the cookies can't be beat.  Only complaint is that the system for getting food and then drinks is confusing and not efficient, too many lines. Just doesn't flow well"}
{"text":"Clean and friendly, and fresh fare that is always good.  I like the new fuji apple, gorgonzola, grilled chicken topped salad.  Also the Asian chicken and BBQ chopped salads, and lemon, chocolate chip, or snickerdoodle cookies..."}
{"text":"Very unhappy with the service and quality of food. They have changed the ordering process and it is very confusing. Why change something that worked so well? My boyfriend ordered a half a panini for $6 and it was done in 2 bites. Needless to say this location we will not be returning to."}
{"text":"#ParadiseBakery #PaneraBread SMH! Management AND corporate made me feel like the roach in my salad is no big deal. Paradise Bakery 2970 E Germann Rd, Chandler AZ 85249. I was eating my greek salad on the go and was halfway finished and thank God I looked down before taking another bite. There was a dead roach mixed in my salad. I immediately spit out what was already in my mouth. I took it back and the manager gave me a hard time ...saying I need a receipt to give me a refund for this $4 salad and kept telling me they wash their salad 3 times and inspect it. First of all if you wash and inspect then there shouldn't have been a roach in my salad. Also I don't care about a refund on a $4 salad...I want you to do something about your establishment if there are roaches so this doesn't happen to someone else. She offered me a replacement salad. Really?!?! Ok so you really think I want another salad after I find a dead roach in the first! Sick to my stomach. Then I called corporate (Panera Bread) and the representative said..\"what's your email address I can send you a $10 gift card\". You think I want to ever eat there again? Really??!! I never even got an apology."}
{"text":"7 a.m. Opening for a bakery?  Lol.  Wtf?  Lazy ass west coasters.  Real bakeries open at 5."}
{"text":"First time, last time.  Evidently the employees are assigned a station and they do not veer from it. The guy making Salads was all over it, but when the bottleneck occurred at the unmanned soup station, he was unable or unwilling to step over the Soup-Salad line. There was one woman slowly frosting cookies. Two women cashiering, one went to help cookie girl and the other went in back to replenish a soup container... Thought she got lost when it took forever for her to come back. The food is fine, but the service was horrible and inefficient.   I will not return."}
{"text":"Second time in the past 45 days with poor service and attention from staff. Ask staff about Hazelnut coffee...several staff tell me \"Im sure it's on it's way out (bringing a new thermos full out)  After 8 minutes I aske again and get the same answer and tell them I tired of everyone saying same thing why dont they go find it (in the meantime 4 people are stadning visiting after telling me \"its coming\" This staff does not get the idea of customer focus. I have client meetings in places like this and will have to refuse this lcoation,"}
{"text":"Still The Worst Restaurant In Goodyear. Nothing Has Changed Since The Last Time I Was Here..."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! I am in love with paradise bakery! I could seriously war there everyday. I've had just about every one of their soups and they are all good. My favorite salads are the southwest chicken ceasar and the greek. Oh and those cookie are beyond fab. They just melt in your mouth. Two thumbs up paradise!"}
{"text":"That one star is one too many!!!!!!! I would give it minus five if it were possible!!!!!   Boy! I hope lots of people get to read this!!!!!  I was a rather frequent customer thereat and usually had some \"interesting\" experiences (meaning not necessarily pleasant at all... But!!!! Today tops it  off!!!!!)  Was treated like shit in so many ways!!!!!!! I think people need to know and I think they need to know what could be behind this as well!!!!!!!  The rep yesterday had allegedly, \"according to a manager\" and a real bizarre employee who head dresses her hair like a twelve year old\", told me wrong..! They have had  so many other inconsistencies in that place that I am not surprised only I have a huge sense of observation and was able to decipher that they have had a chance to undo this  reward yet will most certainly not admit to it!!!... Even if some of their outside terrorists friends did it for them (public sector I mean!!) Ya!! Seriously keep reading I will get to the motive!!!!!  So! the manager who's a real asshole, (glasses, scruffy look  with a tad of an under-bite.. etc) in passing, claimed as  I said that the young lady who'd been so kind the day prior while explaining the reward was actually wrong.. ..and had (don't you know it!!?) miss-read/understood this reward..!!!!!!  I called it witchcraft to their faces but anyway!!!!!!! Yet since they recently became a Panera it made sense because I'd had this exact reward before with another one in Chandler as well...   When they begin as a restaurant they will offer a free coffee or tea or soda for a whole month! Well that was not the case so they now say!! Hmmm...!!!!!! Wow!!!!!! They hand pick their customers...!!!!!!!  How about it?????!!!!!  Anyway! My observant mind also caught on to a crew of sick folks in the place who were there to instigate the incident, along side the employees...!!!!!!  Now that is the part that gets real interesting yet if a reader  is not a whistle blower this may not seem possible; ho!! But if y'all only knew what it means to stand up for what is right in this country, you'd be amazed what our world is sickly able to do..!!!!!!! Me Oh! My!!!!!  I will explain: I am a whistle blower on sex crimes especially  in the church industry of America (so any church!!!!) and I had as a matter of fact a chatt about the ordeal in this  state with that very asshollee manager therein hmmm, again!! Maybe I ruffled some feathers, hey!???? What was this  then today: some retaliation on his part..????? So!! I was saying: I noticed some interesting shit going down btwn several three outsiders inside the place watching and  doing their thing in that joint! One happened to be on his phone and so I approached him after he was off it as I could tell he was a deviant man just by his laugh, demeanor, his general affect; some of us have a sixth sense, is how it is called.... Sure enough he works for pharmaceutical companies of sorts and they do do so.. so.. much damage in MANY, MANY lives as we know especially with the shit they pull on teens who end up committing  suicide because they mess with their brains with meds that make 'em worse not better!!!!!! --Meds they do not need but rather validation for what they have been through often in the home or in their churches or both etc...!!!!!!!   Anyway! I told him my opinion of that shit without the exact whys to the comment (now I just did up above) and it is this too: they medicate people who are hurt  rather than making sure they are compensated as  victims of abuse as it is the case so often and this  way rather than the victims receiving what is due them everyone makes money off of them..: and the culprits to the crimes upon them serve no time in prison where they belong!!!!! Of course those who prescribe the meds to shush victims with the false labels make a profit off of all that is given the poor victims who need not labels but rather freedom from the sick mother fucking aggressors who belong in the slammer for raping their own off-springs in some many cases (especially out this way!!!!!!!!)  So I can't help but wonder if today at that Panera, I  got to receive what this manager wanted done  because I am frank and honest about truths that  many with testicles should be doing something about and they know many women out there are unaware  of how much exploitation to their children is really  taking place and don't you know it, that is an epidemic in the freaking church industry of America!!!!!!!!  In being specific re. his behavior: got cut off at every word while trying to talk to this a-hole, as he wouldn't let me share what was said yesterday by the employee telling me of this awesome reward, now removed from my account as a regular cust. Seems we need to do some boycotting; if it happens to one, it can happen to others!! Maybe even if they are not whistle blowers; could be a religious deference next time, skin color or ?? Who knows? Discrimination is real.  Anyway!! Thanks for reading folks!!!"}
{"text":"Peach/blueberry smoothie looked good but merely tasted like water. An icee has more flavor. Sandwiches okay tho"}
{"text":"Always delicious!  I like the salads and tomato or broccoli cheese soup. The cookies and muffins are yummy.  The croissants are perfect! The hot chocolate is yummy and I drink the black tea all the time! The staff here is awesome!!! In the food court, give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Don't know what to say here. This paradise bakery has changed the ordering format and you can no longer see the food you are ordering. Staff is friendly but got most of the order wrong at first. They promptly took care of it. The food is the same. Still tasty and wholesome but the old format was much much better. Wish it hadn't changed"}
{"text":"I had never been to a Paradise Bakery and Café before this morning. I had some errands to run at Scottsdale Fashion Center so I cruised by to grab a small snack to call breakfast.  The line wasn't long since the Scottsdale Fashion Center had just opened so I knew I had some quick decisions to make. As I scanned the pastry case, I was surprised they had so many options and was feeling pretty good about my chances to choose a delicious pastry. However, the more I looked the less impressed I became. I'm not saying I'm only happy if a place has a chocolate croissant but I will say it's usually my staple at other places. I scanned and scanned and really nothing popped out at me, demanding I eat it so I went with a safety -a blueberry muffin. I also ordered an iced vanilla latte because the temptation was there. Gregory asked me what kind of milk I wanted. I asked for whole milk which they didn't have. Disappointing. I paid, got my muffin and left. It wasn't until I was about to check in that I realized I didn't have my phone. I went back to Gregory who said it wasn't found.   I went home. I attempted to eat my blueberry muffin which was burnt and terrible on the outside and gooey and under cooked on the inside. The latte was okay, nothing special. We called paradise bakery and café back and asked to speak to a manager who confirmed that yes, they did have my phone. I went all the way back to retrieve it.   A disappointing experience at Paradise Bakery and Café for sure. Customer service and blueberry muffin gets zero stars. The latte is what gave them one star because it was at least drinkable."}
{"text":"Hey the food was good and prepared correctly but the restaurant was disorganized and dirty! At 2:30pm on a Thursday  and I had trouble finding a clean table.  I counted 11 dirty tables around me and it wasn't until I left that someone started cleaning them.  It wasn't that they didn't have enough staff.  Well, they had enough managers anyways.  They just stood talking and looking at a disaster of a dining room.  The drink station wasn't kept up either.  I know Paradise Bakery is better than this!"}
{"text":"Very nice location with fresh food. I work at a Paradise Bakery myself, and I always enjoy going to Dana Park! Their GM is awesome, and the staff is always really helpful, and polite (even when I'm clearly a Paradise Employee as well). Being totally unbiased, Dana Park is truly one of the best locations in Arizona, not to say all Paradise Bakeries aren't awesome.... But Dana just does it really well!  If you haven't tried the strawberry rhubarb minicakes (and they're still in season), you HAVE to try one."}
{"text":"From out of town & I stopped by here before an interview at a company near by. Was not impressed. The dining area is crammed and the staff weren't very welcoming. Definitely agree with another review stating its a \"poor man's Panera Bread Company.\" Chicken Noodle Soup lacked flavor and my turkey on my sandwich had a slimy taste to it. Not sure what the big deal is with the cookies, the one I received was hard and not very tasty."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in AZ. turkey, bacon, avocado sandwich with broccoli cheese soup, and a box of lemon chippers to go."}
{"text":"West side, way to disappoint again.    Service over here on the west side continues to be sub par....the food is the same...sort of. Same ingredients, no care, no love.  If that's ok than I guess that's ok, Paradise take a look at your franchises.  This place is falling short."}
{"text":"Love to come here for breakfast & coffee. Had a frozen mocha & shared the breakfast burrito. Very good. It's s great place to go & bring your dog to enjoy the patio with you."}
{"text":"My friend and I have gone here for several years every week to meet up for lunch. The last month the place is so dirty. But the bathrooms are soooo filthy you can't use them. We told the manager 2 weeks ago.. No response. So today we went into the restroom and it was so bad , toilet was so discussing we could not use it. The manager just happened to come in when we were looking at it, we told her. She looked at it and said \"really\" I don't think so! The one toilet had bomit all inside outside etc.. She chuckled at us, gave us a your dumb look and walked out! Was telling a worker about us when we left. I am going to go by and take  pictures tomorrow and I will post.. If they don't care about this.... I can't imagine the kitchen where we can't see!'Don't go there anymore!!! GROSS!!! Also they never have olive oil.. Lame"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try the cheddar, turkey and apple sandwich. I won't be eating here again. After picking up my sandwich and traveling home, I began to eat. After a couple bites I realized that there was a piece of paper inside the sandwich. Some of it was missing, so I'm sure I swallowed it. Absolutely disgusting! If someone can miss a piece of paper when they're making a sandwich, how many other mistakes are they making? My husband called the store, and was told we would receive a free meal the next time we went in. Since I already paid for my meal, and I couldn't eat it, I should have received a refund. Since I'm not planning on eating here again, the free meal doesn't do much good!"}
{"text":"Oh man, this was my favorite place, loved their soups and salads. Recently in the past 2 years, their menu items  has increased but the taste is gone. Their salads have become small and do not taste the same. I ordered their southwest chicken salad and chicken rice soup almost always when I am there. But now my visits have been disappointing. I hope they work on their menu and how they make their foods, I would love to go back to good old Paradise Bakery.. their service is good, servers are very polite. No complaints there. Please work on your menu and how you prepare them, would love to revisit and review my experience on yelp."}
{"text":"I really enjoy fresh healthy food. The salads are great and aways have a great variety of daily soups. The chicken walnut salad sandwich is my favorite sandwich and usually get 1/2 sandwich and cup of soup. It gets really busy around lunch time daily, so you may want to get there no later than 12:30pm if you have a group of two or more."}
{"text":"We walked into the restaurant before 8pm. The staff will not let you sit down assuming the customer knows they can't sit to eat. So they immediately packed our food. At checkout both cashier and soup server would not let us add more ingredients to a soup!!  In my old days I also worked on the food industry and did not rush customers to leave the establishment until the last person left their table.  Let this be a lesson to the company.  Please have signs or let customers know about the closing hours take out policy and not rush \"stress\" customers to leave.  The food was great, the overall checkout service was lacking and very rushing. Terrible.  Paradise Bakery Cafe 610032 1/10/2016 7:57:26 PM Cashier: Brittney"}
{"text":"I like Paradise Bakery for their sandwiches. Their pasta salads are okay. However I find them to lack flavor. The cookies are baked fresh daily and I have tried the chocolate chip cookies, oatmeal raisin, and peanut butter. All three are good if you are into sweets. I am disappointed in the fact that they do not offer a herbal tea. They have three different tea flavors and none of them are herbal."}
{"text":"Inconsistency at its finest. I really hate when you have to pray that one of your favorite menu items comes out okay. I came here because wildflower was too busy. My salad was literally tossed together and my sandwich was microwaved for too long. I was thinking the cookie would help me forget about that considering they're usually good, except I was given some stale excuse of a baked good. I wish I would've waited at wildflower where the food is fresh and worth the money. Will not be back"}
{"text":"Called in a big order spoke with Connor.... he's awesome at taking orders on the phone I tell ya! When I went to go pick up our order Elisa greeted me, she seemed confused and didn't speak up I could barely hear her since it's a little loud in there. She also began to charge me for a different order then I explained I think u are charging me wrong I have a big order which made her even more confused. I asked for Connor and he came by and cleared everything confusion over!!! Whoop whoop! Connor u r awesome.com!"}
{"text":"Staff was very unprofessional. Wasn't greeted when I walked in. Barely even got any eye contact. Sandwhich maker glanced up at me and in a monotone voice asked, \"Sandwhich\". Couldn't tell if it was a statement or a question.   Now, the manager in a black polo with gold name tag. I lost track of how many things she \"leaned\" on. Very disinterested when ringing me up, but then sees a couple co-workers a minute later and becomes the liveliest person in the store.. Not sure why she couldn't be just as friendly with me.   Enforce dress code as well please.. I find it hard to believe that a backward baseball cap, an untucked shirt, and no apron is the dress code standard. Very unprofessional environment. Sad thing is, I saw managers everywhere. What did they do about it? Nothing.."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill big time. Unfriendly. I could almost see the chicken on my sandwich. Ran out of cookies...uh isn't that kinda what you are known for?!?  Disappointing because it used to be great"}
{"text":"The cookies and breakfast pastries are to die for.  Just for those two items they deserve four stars.  Everything else, however, is just OK.  The rest of their foods are good but not great.  If you've ever been to Wildflower, I think their food is better there but dang, I can go to Paradise and just pig-out on their cookies!"}
{"text":"Paradise is a 3 star in my book.  They have the SAME salads and sandwiches all the time (I occasionally note they change a bit up, but nothing new to add to the repertoire), so if you eat there often (like I used to!), you get bored quickly.  This particular location is decent and clean and fairly quick and friendly and hasn't messed up my orders before, so that's a positive note.  Their nutrition online totally sucks and is always down or 'under construction'.  Also, they are a bit tight with their chicken portions and if you do extra chicken to your salad for added protein, it can add up quickly.  Paying $11 for a salad to me is rediculous.. but that's just me.  If I'm paying that much, it better have LOTS of ingredients and be big and of course have a heaping helping of protein (in the form of meat)."}
{"text":"I always receive great service and great food, and the twins that work there are adorable.  :) :)"}
{"text":"Another Panera Bread knockoff. The cinnamon rolls were identical as was the two for one menus. Well at least the pastry was fresh unlike Wildflower Bread."}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating at Paradise, and I have to say it will be my last. I took my mother out to lunch and neither of us had been there before, so we were a little unsure of the ordering system. When I told the first girl who greeted us that we'd never been there before she looked irritated and didn't say anything except, \"What can I get you?\" I proceeded to order the lobster roll, which on the menu clearly states comes with 1/2 a salad or a cup of soup. When I told her the type of soup I wanted she told me I couldn't get the sandwich with soup. When I tried to point out what the menu said, she angrily snapped \"The lobster roll only comes in 1 size and isn't available for a pick 2.\" Again I tried to point out that I wasn't ordering a pick 2, and on the menu it says the sandwich comes with either a soup or salad. She tells me no again, and moves on to my mother. My mom tries to order a salad, and the girl, in an outrageously rude tone said, \" I SAID, any other SANDWICHES?\" Again, we had never been here before, and already made clear that we were unsure how the ordering worked. My mom looked at me overwhelmed and quickly changed her order to a sandwich. We moved down the assembly line and I asked for my cup of soup. When I got to the girl on the register I clarified that the lobster roll did include a cup of soup, and she said yes. When I told her what the sandwich girl had said her response was, \"Oh, she doesn't know anything, she's new.\"  We got drinks and sat down and waited for our food. When it arrived everything was decent. My mom got a turkey avocado BLT (not what she originally wanted, but no one clarified the steps of ordering so she could get what she did want) and I had the lobster roll and a cup of broccoli cheese soup. While the food was OK I would NEVER return, at least to this location. With such a rude and unhelpful staff it was an incredibly uncomfortable and frustrating experience for us."}
{"text":"They make a tasty chicken walnut sandwich.  Their cafe latte was good today as well!  Busy today but quick service."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE their low-fat tortilla soup. It makes my day every time! I can honestly say that I've never had a bad meal here. My only complaint is that their food is kind of spendy."}
{"text":"I swear to you when I walk into a Paradise I feel like my IQ sinks to around 17.8. you can call me stupid but I feel like an absolute idiot trying to figure that place out -EVERY TIME. Do I order here or there? Do I pay  you here or there? I already talked to that person and no I don't want soup. Where do I put my dishes - do you take them?   GOOD LORD THIS PLACE IS CONFUSING.  The food is great but the experience of ordering food, waiting, and being questioned (I must look confused) is daunting to me enough that I don't really enjoy it. I'm always paranoid that I will do something wrong and that makes the experience more difficult.  I am sure that other people are all good with ordering there - they are old pros. However, I find it hard to believe that I am the only one that finds the ordering process to be too crazy.  Food: 4/5 Experience: 2/5"}
{"text":"Decent food. Slightly above average staff. Okay for the money. I have had better everything they offer for the same price or better. But in this area they are one of the few decent eaterys."}
{"text":"I am sad that everytime I go here the service seems to be getting worse and worse and the quality of the food is diminishing as well.  This use to be my go to fave and now I feel like it is just a waste as I am never satisfied like I once was.  Why oh why do they have to change and make things worse? I also have noticed it is not quite as busy as it once was, which also makes me believe others feel the same way."}
{"text":"Always good.  Every location I have been at I get the same quality of food.  I love the Fuji Apple Chicken Salad sans the cheese.  I loved the pesto pasta.  Their regular soups I find lacking in flavor so cannot wait to try the new broth bowls they have."}
{"text":"Love the tuna and turkey/cranberry sandwich!  Possibly the best chocolate chip cookie ever!!  I dont care for their heavier soups - or some of their garlicky salad dressings and/or pastas, but overall, this is a great place for a quick bite!!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service. No one in line, had to wait to order because employees were too busy talking. Waited 15 minutes before they realized I never got my sandwich. Then another 10 for them to make it. Not even an apology. Manager should be fired as this is an ongoing problem. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Go to Panera or wildflower this place is terrible.  Not sure how you screw up this bad being owned by Panera bread but this place is horrible. The ordering system flat out sucks and dosent work. The food is gross and not up to Panera bread standards. Mixed greens were like eating garden waste and the sandwich was like something you get a 7-11. Will never go back.  Just drive the extra couple minutes to Wildflower or Penera"}
{"text":"Cookies Cookies Cookies!  I dropped in for lunch yesterday for the first time.  I had pure intentions of a healthy and well balanced meal......One of each cookie and a cup of yogurt and granola later I had so much sugar that it was hard to stand still for the rest of the day!  They each had a very unique flavor and that original recipe taste.  The granola was delicious with just the right crunch.   Very clean, and friendly service.  Now I that I got the goodies out of the way I'll have to go back for an actual meal."}
{"text":"I live in San Francisco, but  wanted to send some cookies to a Phoenix customer.  I spoke with Barbara, who totally accommodated me, even though I didn't hit the order minimum.  Amazing customer service!!!  Now...if I could just get my hands on one of their cookies!!"}
{"text":"As another writer mentioned, we too stopped by this morning to find that this location no longer exists, probably as it has become the new Panera being opened at AZ Ave and Ocotillo, which looks to be soon. Just a surprise to one not tuned in!"}
{"text":"I want to come in, recite my order once, pay, and get out. However, the design of the queue is infuriating for a quick experience, especially when ordering for a family of 5. Want a 1/2 sandwich and soup meal for Dad, Mac n cheese for the kiddos, and a salad and soup meal for mom?  Well, give your sandwich order at the first counter for Dad, the salad order for Mom at the salad counter, the soup orders for both Mom and Dad at the soup and pasta counter, and then be told that the Mac and cheese order (a pasta dish if I am correct) should have been ordered at the sandwich counter, not the soup and pasta counter... There is no guidance on what is ordered where, and frankly, when ordering for 5, I can't keep track of which component is ordered at whatever respective counter and maintain my sanity at the same time.   And what is this business of not including a cookie with the soup and salad meal?  Apparently you only get a cookie with a sandwich order or kids meal. They cost the same, so what gives?  If nothing else, make it clear for me to know that I need to order a cookie for a salad meal... It's disappointing to get home and realize it isn't included.   In short, the process is far from intuitive. The queue is not designed for a family meal.   I will not return for an easy take home meal for my family at the end of a busy day."}
{"text":"In the grips of a wi-fi withdrawl (while visiting my grandparents in Sun Lakes) I drove through every godless stripmall in the area hoping to find a internet cafe.  I was lured into this wi-fi oasis and have setup my headquarters here.  The tea sucks hard but the cookie aren't bad.  It's a big place that gets really busy around lunch.  5 stars for www dots and for not kicking me out yet."}
{"text":"Love love love the snickerdoodles!  Oh yeah and the chicken walnut sandwich and the barbecue chicken salad are really good as well.  Great when you want fresh food fast."}
{"text":"Paradise bakery is very good.  Good selections and excellent pastries."}
{"text":"I love this place. The good Is always so gd and fresh and Ofcourse healthy. The staff are so friendly here!! This nice gentlemen who works there ran out to hold the door open for me ! So nice of him to do that"}
{"text":"I really like this place! Their salads and sandwiches are really good and the employee's are always really nice, which I love. Sometimes I can be one of \"those\" customers, always changing stuff around. Each time they are totally fine with it and don't seem to mind. I appreciate that! Plus they give you a cookie with your meal... who doesn't love that?!"}
{"text":"Terrible value for mediocre food at best.   Small portions with lazy staff.    Will not return."}
{"text":"The 5 stars is for the great customer service we received yesterday by the manager.  1 star for Cashier with an attitude of \"I really don't want to be here!\" It's sad as people without a job would love to be in her post ringing diners. Everyone from from group noticed it.  4 stars for the food. Some items we ordered were a bit on the salty side. But manager remedied it by offering us food that may be less salty. I hope he tried the soup and other items we returned so he can adjust the flavour.  Place was clean with a couple of tables requiring attention. 3 stars.  Will return here again. Will recommend spot to others as well."}
{"text":"While I don't know that I'll ever recover from the removal of the Cubano from the menu, I've found the Frontega chicken a second favorite.  Today I tried the new Pasta Primavera Salad and was pleasantly surprised. It has very good flavor. Mixing a bit of everything, the spinach, pasta, pesto sauce, carrot, and squash...delicious!"}
{"text":"I waited in line for 6 cookies. Got to the car and i only had 4. Had to wait in another long ass line to get the other two. This place sucks. Omg she charged me for them! After all that inconvenience. Paradise can choke on the $1.61. I'll never return."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have a loyalty card because I go here so much. Every location is the same, amazing food and great customer service. I always get the Greek salad and half sandwich of turkey/avocado BLT and they make it perfect every time."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever!!!! Especially outside of the lunch rush. I was also denied fresh cookies because \"the ones over there are just as good\". Frankly, I should be able to select any cookie I want in the display in my opinion. Guess customer service is NOT a priority and managers are too busy in the back to see what's happening in the front! The food is about average, so if you find that plus poor customer service enticing, then this is the place for you Try Wildflower Bread down the road - same concept, better food, and good customer service."}
{"text":"I was scheduled to sightsee in Sedona and the grand canyon on my recent trip to Pheonix on Presidents Day 2016, but ended up here at the Paradise Bakery Cafe the morning of instead. Life's weird like that, unfortunately.  Maybe it turned out to be the best though, in a depressing weird way. Saved a bunch of money by not going north and ended up meeting a couple of friends here at the Paradise Bakery Cafe, who lives in Scottsdale for the first time, both of them are ultra marathoners and crazy travelers - kind of like I am. I was steered into the Paradise Bakery here at the Desert Ridge Marketplace by the recommendation from my friend and her husband. I got here around 9am and waited 20 minutes for them. In the meantime, I also had gotten breakfast here, from the $20 a friend loaned me. The bakery itself was pretty cool, almost like a Starbucks, but without the coffee shop smells of a Starbucks. Yes, they do sell coffee, but not like Starbucks. Luckily, there is a Starbucks nearby. The restaurant has a nice seating area and has free wifi, along with outlets to plug your devices in and Chillax. The plugs are against the wall near the floor. Not sure if there was real air condition here, but it did not feel cold at all.   The Paradise Bakery Cafe is pretty neat little bakery, almost like a Panera Bread, but a little smaller. Wish we had a Panera Bread in Honolulu, but you know how that is, and I'm digressing a little bit. The restaurant itself has a sizable seating area, as aforementioned with the Starbucks comparison, and is reasonably clean and organized. There is also free wifi to hang out here and the booth seating is quite comfortable. The Paradise Bakery is located at the Desert Ridge Marketplace shopping complex in the desert ridge culdesac of Phoenix, AZ at 21001 North Tatum Boulevard. There's plenty of parking here, since Paradise Bakery Cafe is nestled within the Desert Ridge marketplace shopping complex. I was pretty lucky to find parking here so close to the shop on a holiday. There was plenty of kids and families hanging out at the fountain common area around the corner, which made me happy and forget about my problem for a little bit.  The prices here are competitive as any breakfast pit stop. Drinks, breakfast options, and a whole host of soups and sandwiches, as well as other options to quell any hunger pangs that had gotten you into a frenzy. I ended up getting a ham and cheese omelette and couple of blueberry muffins on the side. The scones took pretty awesome too, but I did not get them. The combination of cheddar cheese and the eggs intertwined was very good and delicious. The blueberry muffins are really soft and moist, like they came straight from the oven, just for me. It was great and sinfully delicious! Wish I did take photos of my meal, but I guess I was just preoccupied with other things that morning, like how to get around with a rental car without driving it without a valid driver's license. The ambiance was quite nice and definitely welcomed the quietness of the morning, up until my friends came to hang out with me.  The Paradise Bakery cafe is in a few states, not just in Arizona, so that's comforting. They're in many areas of Pheonix and they make sure that your satisfaction is well worth it. The service here is friendly and terrific. They really know how to brighten one's morning. I'd recommend this place for your alternative to Panera Bread and Starbucks - if you need a break from either or both of them.  4 stars!  Support local!  B+"}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place. I enjoy the soup and 1/2 sandwitch and cookie as much as the next guy, but not something I crave. I usually stop here if I'm in the mall or otherwise in the area and dont feel like going far for lunch. My favorite cookies are the lemon and the peanut butter."}
{"text":"I like this location for mingling and talking with friends. It's one of the few coffee house environments in the area between Central Ave  and the Biltmore Plaza at 32nd Street & Camelback RD. I have stopped in twice and it's always busy. The cookies and bread I have tasted here is very good and fresh.   However I have made purchases from the Paradise Bakery in the food court at Paradise Valley Mall and the brownie was so had I had to return it.  I was refunded my money and given mircowaved blueberry muffin that was probably heated to hide that it was not fresh.  It's all on the pricey side for simple baked goods coffee drinks and sandwiches so I have yet to make this a place I go to regularly."}
{"text":"This location might be considered a bit outside of usual walking distance for a \"quick lunch\" for others in my building. However, on a nice day like today, and when I'm wearing my comfortable shoes, I love talking a walk down Washington to visit Paradise Bakery.   I know that many folks are anti-chain and although Paradise is a chain restaurant, their service and food have always been consistently good in my experience. I can always count on high quality, fresh ingredients, a great iced tea, and the PERFECT chocolate chip cookie. I have never been disappointed by any meal at any Paradise Bakery. P.S. Their pesto is to-die-for!!   My favorite lunches include the Greek Salad, Blue Cheese Salad, BBQ Chicken Salad, Tuscan Chicken Sandwich, Roast Beef Sandwich, and the Thai Wrap. I also like the small salad and 1/2 sandwich combo. Oh, and the Fire Roasted Tomato soup . . . very yummy!! I could go on and on . . .   A note about the salad, they are very generous with their dressing so I usually get it on the side.   Today I had to wait a little bit longer than normal, but it was the beginning of the downtown lunch rush, so wait times are to be expected. Each person I interacted with was very friendly (salad assembler, sandwich artist, and cashier).   In short, I'm a fan of Paradise Bakery!"}
{"text":"It's okay! I would prefer breakfast club but it's a great place to get a quick bite! But it's very confusing to order. It is a healthy choice tho"}
{"text":"Very cute, pretty good sandwich and coffee.  This is a pretty good place to stop in between shopping sprees.  They have really good/healthy sandwiches and good coffee drinks.    *Service = really fast and nice *Food = good and healthy *Atmosphere = relaxing and cute *Brownie = yummy :)"}
{"text":"Literally, the worst location. I only go to this location is I absolutely have to. The employee's are so slow (3 people in line, it'll take 20-40 minutes to even order), the food never tastes that great, the manager knows NOTHING (he isn't able to even run gift cards, employee's had to help him), and the manager is so mean to the employee's. I witnessed an employee (maybe 16) ask the manager for nuts as he was making a salad and the manager leaned in, took the employee's arm and angrily said something to the 16 year old. The manager walked away and the 16 year old employee looked so hurt and angry. I was in SHOCK. If Panera ever decides to take control of this location, I suggested restaffing the entire store. I try my hardest to avoid this location as much as possible."}
{"text":"Went to this location and placed a carry out order of sandwiches, pasta and soup.  We paid for everything - got our large bag and were told to \"have a good day\".  No problems.  However - the soup lids were not on properly and leaked all over my lap on the way home.  We also did not receive any of our sandwiches.  When we went back - they said \"Oh did you forget to take them?\"  NO - YOU DIDN'T GIVE THEM TO US!!!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere. modern comfortable setting. The customer service was great. They had a cheerful young lady running the register. But the person who actually took the order wasn't the best. Kinda blah. They had a new guy making our sandwiches and they honestly didn't come out very good. It wasn't proportioned well and was SO dry. They don't put anything on the bread. Everything else was good. Yummy cookies!"}
{"text":"We love going to Paradise Bakery and now we have one even closer to us in the Goodyear Centerpoint (Pebble Creek & McDowell).    Their food is very good, plenty for your $$ and different items on their menu.  Staff is normally friendly and they have a fequently visitor card to earn points too!  This location has outdoor seating and free Wi-fi as well!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location since 1998.  Morning breakfast.  Mandarin Orange muffin and a large Mango ice tea everyday for nearly 5 years when I worked at the office building next to the mall.    Cookies are awesome.  Soups are great and sandwiches are wonderful.  I highly recommend the club sandwich and tomato soup.  If you need a snake size sugar rush, grab a box of chippers.  Comes in 15 or 6.  Also makes a great gift for your sweetheart.    I've never tried their decorative party cookies, but the look amazing in the case.  Free refills on sodas and tea.    Almost forgot,  try the lemon zest cookies.  Never found anything as close to perfect as this cookie."}
{"text":"The service and food are exceptional! I love coming back to Arizona knowing a get to have lunch at this place! I had the pasta and a turkey sandwich. Doesn't sound like much  it is definitely worth it to go here!"}
{"text":"What a rip!  They changed their salad containers to a small box that barely has a cup of salad in it for $5.29.  Are you kidding? How much can lettuce cost you guys?  You use to be a decent value but not with this.  I'd stop serving salads if this is what you want to deliver."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and the food is always good. Drinks are another story. Haven't been back since over a period of a month, I went in on three different occasions and their machine was broken so I couldn't get my hot drink. Nice service with a smile here."}
{"text":"From the perspective of a celiac: their cookies still aren't gluten-free, but some of their salads (sans croutons) are definitely A-OK."}
{"text":"I had to give this place two stars because I came once and it was good and once and it was terrible.  The first time was right before closing so they were fast and wanted me out of there. Efficient and he girl gave me a free drink.  I came at 4PM during the week and they had an ancient lady workings the cash register with 7 people in line. I finally asked for another cashier and they brought out an equally old cashier. I'm sorry but when you are busy then you need quick cashiers.  It was painfully slow. The only reason I stayed is because I wanted a cookie.  Get your act together."}
{"text":"Worst sandwiches ever. You can get the same quality of sandwich at your local grocery store. Not very innovative when it comes to the sandwiches. The only reason they get a couple stars is because the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"PANERA RUINED THIS PLACE. This used to be my favorite part about visiting Scottsdale's Mall. We purchased a dozen cookies and a cinnamon role yesterday from a rude woman with no patience or communication skills. The cookies were DRY and disgusting like the ones you usually find at Panera, nothing like they used to be at the real Paradise Bakery. The best part was the crappy variety, whereas you used to have about 8 or more cookie choices at paradise. I was told to pick from just one tray of Dry brittle cookies that resembled their former selves but only visually. This place makes me sad, and I won't be back until Panera stops ruining it with its dry corporate bland ways."}
{"text":"I was at the mall this morning killing time.  I really wanted a kale smoothie and none to be found at this mall.  The employees here said they'ed make me one.  It was unexpected and made my day.  All of you were awesome thanks to the shake maker for creating it for me and the gentleman in black polo for suggesting it!  You guys Rock!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Paradise for awhile, but their salads are still awesome. Alexa was the cashier and she was very friendly and helpful when I had questions about the nutrients of some of the dressings. Need more great employees like her!"}
{"text":"Giving this place a star only. Came here around 10:30am for breakfast only to be told they stop serving breakfast at 10!!!(even McDonalds serves breakfast all day now) Ok so decided to get something from there lunch menu and ordered a steak panini. They gave me a chicken panini instead!! Told the lady they ran out of half and half and she didn't even care.  The place is not even busy but there are tables that are not cleaned. Wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"My friend wanted the strawberry salad from here. It was her birthday so I thought \"why not\".  I am not a real fan as I feel all the salads have the same underlying taste   What a surprise I received when I opened my take out box and ate the salad. I don't tend to use dressing as I think it covers the flavour of the ingredients in a salad.  My friend on the other hand thought the poppy seed dressing was good. This was a refreshing salad to eat. Each bite I could rate the brilliance of summer fruit.   Would highly recommend this salad   Lucky we ate this as my friends Josie as there was no cutlery in the take out bag that the server passed to me. So check you bags to make sure you have what you need"}
{"text":"Someone please, please tell me why these places are so popular.  I really don't get it.  The food is very, very average.  The place has no edge and nothing sets it apart.  Why would anyone go to these places?  Why not find a good deli or local coffee shop?   To be fair, they have good iced tea but that doesn't exactly require a master chef.  I hate how poeple frequent mediocre establishments in this town just because they are everywhere.  Support local, everyone...please..."}
{"text":"We ordered a full steak and white cheddar panini. $10. It was disgusting. The sandwich had just as many onions as the meat   Wish we would have known and ordered without. After removing the onions and trying a bite the first reaction was \"what's that I'm tasting cause it ain't good\". So much horseradish  sauce that it totally overwhelmed the sandwich. Couldn't even taste the meat. I tried taking a price of meat out of the sandwich and it WAS the meat. Slightly sweet with a heavy handed dose of horseradish .  Damn. Couldn't even eat it. Horrible. My wife was having the same experience so we pushed it aside and tried the corn chowder soup. It was okay. Run of the mill, nothing special soup. But at least we were able to put something in our bellies. At least the complimentary cookie was decent.  The caramel latte wasn't  bad either. Stay away from the white cheddar steak panini. Blahhhh. The only thing that would make happy is to get my money back for the awful sandwich"}
{"text":"Overrated. Overpriced. Underwhelming.   The cashiers are nice and friendly, but that's as good as this place gets.   Their sandwiches are pathetic. They are also not worth what you pay for.   I recommend going to a better place for your food.  I'm going to use my \"never again\" card for this one."}
{"text":"Terrible service. No clean tables in the section near the bathrooms and no lids for the small size cups.  Seriously."}
{"text":"So, I've been going to Pardise since it open, what, 7 yrs ago? They have one of the best managers they've ever had, now. Mason, is the best. He's always there when I come in and is the nicest and most helpful manager I've seen EVER. You can tell he's good as all the employere are nice, smiling  and go out of their way to just be pleasant. It's the best feeling to go in here after a hard day at work, so nice!  4 stars? - that's Panera's fault. As they now own Paradise, no samples anmore. Health dept. my foot, that's just Panera being cheap.   Otherwise, great work, guys - you make it joy to come here!"}
{"text":"Another restaurant owned by \"Panera\"  The atmosphere is nice and the line is short  Their cookies are amazing. Everything is good on the menu and this place is good for kids and adults.   Come here for casual dining. There is a park right by there and you can go eat there."}
{"text":"Best customer service I ever got, without buying a thing.  I came in, carrying a satchel and looking fairly disheveled.  It was cold outside, probably rainy too.  I sorta sat in the food court for a while, then without saying anything to her, a girl came from Paradise and handed me a hot apple cider and said it was on the house.  Doesn't matter she possibly thought I was homeless, that's still the nicest thing a person's done for me."}
{"text":"This is my new Panera for lunch.  Came in with a friend... got the 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad.  Both were yummy and filling and you even get a freshly baked cookie with it.  My husband has told me that the staff room at his worked always has a box of their cookies out and now I know it's because the cookies are awesome.  They are the crunchy around the outside and soft and gooey on the inside like fresh baked cookies your grandma makes.  I like it a lot and will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Always awesome cookies.  Avoid the lunch-time rush though!"}
{"text":"Get me a slice of paradise, please! Heard this is better than Panera even though it's owned by same company.   Located in the mall. How convenient.  Pastry is AMAZING, even as simple as a chocolate cookies is so good! I heard the lemon cookies are tasty too!   We also tried Apple and turkey on a cranberry bread was pretty tasty too! The cranberry bread made the difference! It was not stale at all by evening hours."}
{"text":"Panera Bread has made a HUGE mistake in their handling of the Paradise buyout. Most of us that grew up with Paradise loved it for various reasons. The Chicken salad sandwich with their sweet bread was to die for. And, you got a free chocolate chip cookie. Well, no more! Panera has totally screwed up the experience. Our chicken salad sandwich was very, very salty and didn't even taste like the original. The bread has now been substituted with some inferior crap of Panera's design - TERRIBLE. The west is a niche environment and should not be treated as a typical \"takeover\" investment. As far as retaining old customers, Panera will fail. These idiots need to know their customer base before waving a wand and ruining the experience. This will be our last visit."}
{"text":"Tasty and fresh. The ordering process can be a bit confusing and takes time to get used to but it's worth it. Tomato soup and fontina grilled cheese was perfect for cool cloudy day. Caesar salad was also good. Disappointed they were out of the mango tea but they have a few tea options to choose from (personally choose to go back to basic unsweetened ice tea). Would LOVE if stevia was sweetener option. I'll be back. My husband on the other hand, doesn't love their sandwiches and prefers to join only on a buy one coupon occasion."}
{"text":"One of the best run Paradise Bakeries I have been to.  They are generally pretty steady, but usually don't have crazy long lines and poor service like some of the other locations in the area.  They do tend to be really busy for brunch though on Sunday mornings when the weather is nice, so avoid it then.  Tables are usually bussed quickly, and the staff seems to care more and be more helpful.  Shop is pretty clean.  The cookies are delicious!"}
{"text":"Don't let the full parking lot and long lines fool you.  One or two slices of meat and cheese do not make a proper sandwich.  Add that to the dry bread, little or no mayo/mustard and what you get is no better than a factory-made sandwich from 7-11.    Shame, it's so close to my new residence.  I guess I'll be adding another 5 minutes to my drive from now on to get a good deli sandwich from Jason's."}
{"text":"Typical Paradise Bakery Clean restaurant. Great Food. Great Service."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here several times.  He even gets catering orders from here once and a while if his customers request it.  A couple times they have left out a thing or two on his catering orders.  The reason I am giving it 2 stars is because I find the quality of their food to be at or below average.  The food tastes processed to me and does't seem fresh.  The tables and bathrooms could use a good scrubbing.  Occasionally, they have been out of their chocolate chip cookies or the cookies were hard.   One good thing:  The location is great because it is by the Desert Ridge fountain where your kids can play."}
{"text":"I have to say that I've really never liked this place.  It was the \"go to\" spot for lunch at the Gainey Ranch location when I worked in that area, and I always dreaded it when my team suggested it.   It feels like an over-hyped, somewhat overpriced sandwich place that just doesn't hit the mark for me.  I'm not a big sandwich person anyway and their salads leave something to be desired. They are soaked in too much dressing, odd tasting chicken with a somewhat slimy texture and I don't like the set-up of their counter service.  My mom was in town and she likes PB, so we shared a southwest chicken sandwich on a ciabatta roll and a southwest ceasar salad, maybe too much \"southwest\" in one meal, but it all tasted over dressed and the bread was tasteless.  She looked at me and said \"we should have gone to Y.C.'s Mongolian BBQ for the same price.\"  I would have to agree.  I would actually give it 2.5 stars because I have enjoyed the quiche muffin when I'm in the mood for a protein snack (and there are no better options) and my friend swears by the breakfast croissant sandwich."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and soups, great cookies and a nice selection of drinks.  When you look at other Yelp'ers reviews of Paradise Bakery, there is a noticeable drop-off when they switch to the new menu.  So far, they've resisted that change here!  What Paradise does best, is to offer a good sandwich, half or whole and bowl of delicious soup. Whenever we come here it's our go to meal, that is ... healthy. But that has never stopped us from turning our noses up to one of those soft and tasty chocolate chip cookies. Their Onion Soup is almost as good as the one found at Zinc Bistro, but without the melted Gruyere cheese. LOL  Well, not really. But it's very good.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I work in the office building next to the mall and hit the food court about once a week, and this place gets my money almost every time. (unless I can't pull myself away from the wafting scent of Panda Express Orange Chicken, but that is another review)  Their chicken walnut salad sandwich is my favorite, served on a delicious honey wheat bread.  Their soups and salads are fresh and they have different options daily.  But do not leave without a couple of their chocolate chip and snickerdoodle cookies.     Also, check out the cookie samples on the corner of the counter."}
{"text":"Mmmm - they have a great vegetarian sandwich that I just can't resist!  The bf and I went for lunch on a Sunday and were happily surprised to find that they weren't busy.   The guy taking lunch orders was super friendly, and didn't mind that I'm a picky vegetarian - a big plus in itself!  Always had a positive experience here!"}
{"text":"The cinnamon roll is delicious. My family ate here while on vacation. It had good breakfast options, reasonable sized portions and reasonable prices compared to most breakfast places. Don't expect to get the oversized portions that you receive at most breakfast places."}
{"text":"Not pleased with food handlers not wearing gloves. Every time I go there to go get a salad, the person that makes my salad is without gloves. Everyone that serves food should be wearing gloves especially while working the salad counter."}
{"text":"I love PB, this one in particular. I worked there in High School (eons ago).  I really feel like this location tries harder than the free standing stores since there is so much competition in the food court.  The cookies are better, the sandwiches just taste like more care was put into their making, and the staff is friendly and efficient.  The salads are more carefully crafted and are not drowning in dressing.  I don't know if it is the training or what, but I feel like the effort the staff puts out shows their commitment to good food, and their pride in their work."}
{"text":"it's literally PARADISE. I'm obsessed with it. If i ever move to arizona, the only reason would be to be closer to paradise bakery. I go to arizona once or twice a year to visit family who live in Scottsdale and honestly all i really care about is coming here to get my banana chocolate chip muffin. I'm obsessed with muffins, and finally i found the perfect muffin on the planet. All of the other ones are great as well, and so are all of the breads and sandwiches. Actually, basically everything is delicious. And it's a gorgeous looking bakery. man, i hope i'm going to Arizona soon."}
{"text":"Bread bowls, salads, sandwiches  and COOKIES! What more could you ask for?!  Beware of the Booth seating...this place gets"}
{"text":"I have been a patron at this location for a number of years.  It was has always been ok up until the past year and it has done nothing but gone downhill.  The new ordering format is not welcoming to customers.  The staff used to be great, but now are not very friendly or helpful.  It is disappointing that somewhere I used to enjoy going for relaxation has declined."}
{"text":"I agree with previous posters... the service here is terrible! This place needs new management. We were in line and received our grilled cheese sandwich, and had to wait at least 20 minutes in line to get our soup after that. Trouble is, there was hardly anyone in line! The employees move at snails pace, and because the soup lady had to get something in the kitchen, no other employees would step up to help the station. By the time we sat down, our cheese sandwiches were stone cold. The employees don't act like they care that people are in a backed up line for a very long time. Why on earth can't anyone fix such a simple problem?"}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I used to love this place but over time the prices have increased while the food quality and portion sizes have gotten smaller. The employees don't seem as friendly either. They took my favorite sandwich off of the menu, which was the only reason I went there in the first place. I ordered something similar but it wasn't nearly as good. It had pulled chicken which obviously wasn't drained from the liquid it was sitting in, and caused the ciabatta bread to be soggy and messy, when it's suppose have a crunch to it. I used 5 napkins while eating it.  It's pretty pricey too. I paid $19 for a sandwich, a half sandwich and a small salad with a tiny container of dressing. It wasn't even enough to moisten the entire salad. I'm completely over it."}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning to meet some folks for coffee and it was closed. The lights were off and the sign was off the front. There was no evidence that a Paradise Bakery had ever been there. Unfortunate."}
{"text":"They have a lot of options but nothing really stands out as amazing to me... Definitely not worth price..."}
{"text":"People loves PB, but I don't understand the hype. In summer the place is hot as heck. It seems no air conditioning.  Very uncomfortable inside and outside. The first thing I asked when I arrived was are you still serving breakfast?  I got a yes, but then was told no more breakfast.  They did do it for me afterall, but i wish now they didn't.  They have no business being in the breakfast business. I paid 12 for bfast, incl soup.  I'd say that's pricey, but after they forgot my bacon, they put together a bunch of pieces left over. I had to ask them,  why are you giving me bacon bits? But they just let me take that to the table.  At nearly $5, the price of their cup soup is comparable or more than any brand restaurant,  yet their chicken noodle soup is mostly water. I had to return. The eggs were terrible. I had to go get something to eat after I got out of there.  Not good."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 Asiago bagel sandwiches and all three of us got violent food poisoning a couple of hours later.  I finally had enough energy to call Monday and they seemed like they didn't care.  I told the lady, Kelly, that they should look into the ingredients or the employees working to see what the source could be.  She was like, wait, you want us to do what, look at the ingredients?  I said just to make sure no one else gets sick.  Yep, they did not care, just said ok thanks for calling.  All three of us had to take days off work because of this and that's the kind of response we get.  I'm not supporting that restaurant again."}
{"text":"Best place in the food court, hands down.  Great service, superior food and AM-A-ZING cookies!  (It's true..they really are.)  Being that I work in the mall, it's my go-to spot for a Diet Coke or a little 3pm pick-me-up. Free refills too, which is a nice little perk.   They've always got a line (especially Fri-Sun), so make sure you know what to order by the time you get to the register.   I highly recommend the Tomato Basil pasta salad, the black & white Chippers, the Chicken Walnut salad and the peach decaf iced tea!  The manager, Jessie, is also a doll. Very nice."}
{"text":"Paradise has changed so much of the menus over the last 5 year it's a totally different Resturant. I ordered a tomato mozzarella panini and was given a tomato mozzarella flatbread - without notification that what I ordered was no longer available. The flatbread was soggy and it seems they forgot the mozzarella part of the sandwich in addition to the panini bread. So disappointing because this used to be one of my favorite lunch spots but after more than a few sub-par encounters my family will not be customers any longer."}
{"text":"If I were rating on the food alone I would give it a 4 star. I enjoy the food served here. Unfortunately the service is subpar. The cashier was very rude. My wife asked if they had tea and the cashiers response was \"Ya we do, I have no idea what kind though, it's over there you can go check it out\" after ordering the tea the cashier handed my wife a steaming glass of water. We waited for our sandwiches, finished eating and it is STILL steaming, way too hot to even sip still."}
{"text":"Screw this place. It used to be good until Panera took them over. I spent 15 minutes trying to get through to make a phone order and kept getting hung up on. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"It was my first time to Arizona and the first meal I had in the state was at Paradise Bakery. The place did not disappoint. I ordered the eggs, bacon, toast, and fruit combination. I also ordered the strawberry waffles. Both did not disappoint. The meals seemed very basic, but taste wonderful. Definitely a place for breakfast and brunch."}
{"text":"I only go here for their Walnut Chicken Salad sandwich and cookies. I should probably reverse the order of that because the cookies are the real treat. We used to come here regularly on Saturdays until we moved closer to the location on Scottsdale Road. The sandwiches are relatively expensive and it is hard to get out of there for under $10, so I limit my visits. If I get a two for one cookie then it is close to $12. I will go to the less expensive sub shops for a turkey sandwich, etc. I used to get salads here too but since Panera bought Paradise I do not like the changes they have made to the salads. The broccoli cheese soup is still great and I sometimes get that to-go. Lunch time is busy so I usually try and come here after the rush. It is nice to sit outside on their patio when the weather is good. We used to hold our annual HOA meetings here in the room in the back. It was a perfect venue. They require a $150 food/drink minimum to use the room, which worked out just fine and the homeowners loved the bakery yummies. If you feel like splurging a little bit and your sweet tooth is acting up, this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. It is the worst paradise bakery in Maricopa County. The food is prepared with very little care at all and nothing is ever hot including the soup. They use paper plates and bowls rather than real dishes. When you get a bowl of soup it is half of what you would get at another paradise bakery. The staff is always completely disorganized and they don't even bring you your food. What's the point on giving the customer a number for the table?"}
{"text":"Wife and i visited this PB last night with some coupons we had for dinner. We arrived there around 7pm. The place had very few people in it which was nice.  We sat down in one of the booths next to another booth that was dirty. The place was dead but none of the employees bothered to come out and clean up the whole time we were there. They had music playing over the speakers and every 4 seconds the music would skip like a broken record. This drove me insane. I got up and went over to the counter and asked the girl cutting meat if they could either fix the music or turn it off. She looked at me like i was crazy or something. One of the other employees came up and i explained to him that the music needed to be fixed or turned off. He said the music has been like that for weeks and it didnt bother him. Well it bothers me and i wont come back there until they fix it. I told him to ask the manager for me to turn the music off or fix it. I sat back down and waited for a manager to come acknowledge us but no one ever came. No one bothered to care. From now on i will be going to the other Paradise Bakery off of Germann street and will never come back to this PB. I am finding a lot of the restaurants close to Sun Lakes area suck!"}
{"text":"I keep going to Paradise Bakery expected to be impressed or at least enjoy the food more than I do: I've had the chicken salad and paradise club. Both are eh. I'd rather go to Port of Subs or Jimmy Johns. The cookies are good but super sweet -- so much sugar. The soup is kind of gross -- I had the chicken and wild rice and had the texture of soupy jello.  I'll go here if i have to but it's certainly not my first choice. Maybe I just need to find something I like here."}
{"text":"I can't complain about the prices, the cleanliness, or the staff all of which were great. But I am not happy that they don't have the BBQ chicken salad at this location, the drink stands are behind the counter and they serve your dine in orders in plastic bowls.   Now I don't know if they get a bunch of rowdy high school students in here and they do things differently than other PBC's concerning the drinks and the dish-ware, but how hard is is to make a BBQ chicken salad? :-(  This location is small and really does have limited items on the menu. You would be better off going to one of the other locations unless it's a super emergency and you really need a chocolate chip cookie!"}
{"text":"This is the third time my family has gone to this location only to find out that they've made our sandwiches incorrectly, or forgotten ingredients. Staff is not helpful when you ask for corrections to your sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place is good for their assortment of sandwiches, soups, and salads. You can even pick up an assortment of muffins or donut dots for a meeting or two. This place reminds me of Panera. Only one thing, I was surprised to notice that they are not very allergy friendly even though their image is of a healthy, wholesome, organic place to eat. Most everything on the menu had an allergen such as eggs, milk, or peanuts which are the top 3 allergens for kids. It was very difficult to find something to eat without these allergens and the staff mostly had very little suggestions to help."}
{"text":"This place is the best Paradise I've been to.  There was no wait (so unusual) and the staff was incredibly kind and let my partner try every soup on hand. The fruit salad was fresh, the cookies were amazing and the bread was soft - but I don't expect less from Paradise.  The only thing that's hard to handle are the hours... I'm craving Paradise for dinner and can't have it!"}
{"text":"This is a frequent dining spot for me. There are not to many options in downtown Phoenix, however this place has a great variety. I am not a sandwich gal or a fan of deli's though Paradise Bakery has a great variety on their menu to offer for all types of eaters. Everything is fresh. They have daily soup options and tasty crisp salads to go. As far as the deserts (cookies, brownies, etc) All I can say is YUMMY!   The staff is always friendly. The management team is always upbeat and greets all visitors who walk through the door.   There is indoor and outdoor seating. This place gets busy so they offer call in to go orders.   For a healthy option this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Looks like the Paradise Bakery (Panera) location has permanently closed. Enjoyed this location, sorry they closed."}
{"text":"I'm giving this paradise bakery 2 stars, because 1 every time I go in there their staff is never friendly. And on top of that, today i placed a to go order and they gave me the wrong soup when I got home. I love paradise bakery but this location is terrible."}
{"text":"This is one of the newer Paradise Bakery & Cafe's. When you enter, you encounter the bakery and coffee bar, but can go ahead and skip to the sandwich counter or further down to the salad and soup station depending on what you are craving. The service I've had here has been quick and friendly. The only downside is that it can get packed pretty quickly, leaving you with few outside seating options to choose from. Many times, you will find that a table of four is being occupied by a loner on his/her laptop, grr.   Anyhow, the food is always delicious and on the healthier side (as long as you stay away from the cookie that comes with the sandwich). I've had salads, soups, and sandwiches from here and they all have tasted fresh. You can also do combos of either a half of sandwich with soup or a small salad and soup, which I always take advantage of! The coffee is good, but super expensive (I'm sorry, but did I just step into Starbucks?!). Another bummer of this location is the parking, it can be a challenge depending on what time of day you go, but when you finally do park and enjoy your meal, you'll found out it was worth it."}
{"text":"HOLY CRAP. They have these ginormous cinnamon roles for a measly $2 something. My fatty mcfattiness had to cut the blasted thing into four pieces.   Since I only saved one star for when I get to try something beyond the coffee and muffins/pastries, I can't add one. But fudge it all. add a halfsy. Hot damn that roll was big."}
{"text":"Usually I don't come into this location because I've had bad experiences in the past, but it was convenient as I was shopping around Desert Ridge. As I've said before, usually service is lacking, but my cashier relieved this predisposition that I had. Thaddeus was the worker who helped me, he was knowledgable and helpful, and knew what he was doing. He greeted me with a smile and helped me figure out what I wanted. Keep him around!"}
{"text":"Because the menu has been completely changed to a Panera menu (which has much less variety than the PB menu) I decided to try out something new.  Ordered a turkey sandwich to go. Got home, opened my sandwich and realized they gave me a roast beef sandwich! Different toppings and everything; a completely different sandwich! My only consolation would have been the cookie they usually give with sandwiches, but instead I found a loaf of bread! Who gives a loaf of bread as a side with a sandwich?  TLDR; new bad menu, bad service. Never coming back to a PB location now that they've all changed to whatever this bad food is."}
{"text":"Pros:    Very similar to Panera Bread    Clean    Nice Service    Good Cookies Cons:    Was good but not great"}
{"text":"I like this location.  It's your usual Paradise Bakery fare.  Nothing different than any other location, in terms of menu.    For those unfamiliar, the menu consists of fresh salads, sandwiches and soups, plus baked sweets.  Nothing out of the ordinary, but in this day of fried this-and-that, it's nice to get a fast, tasty meal that doesn't involve deep-fryer immersion.  It can be very busy but the employees keep the tables clean and available.  There is an obvious effort to making orders accurately.  The employees are friendly.  This kind of place appeals to people of all ages and walks of life.    Last week I took a day off to spend with my 10 year old, who was on Spring break.  I let her pick our \"going out to lunch place\".  She chose this Paradise Bakery.  She enjoys the fresh food selections, and sitting on the patio.  There were business people eating lunch, seniors, ladies lunching, all kinds.    Apparently it's good place for a first date! An older couple who sat near us were on their first date, matched up on E-Harmony.com, according to my daughter over overheard this exchange when   I ran to get a tea refill.   They have AWESOME fresh brewed Iced Tea, which is a big PLUS in my book.  They also have free WI-FI, and it's a great place to meet a friend for a snack and a visit.    GO AND GET A Ginger Molasses Cookie!"}
{"text":"Came by hoping for some cookies and bread around 745 and when I walked in I was told they had no pastries left and were closed. I saw them putting away pastries before I walked in. Sign states they are open until 8. Hmm..."}
{"text":"So, I want to first say that we love the food here and we come here at least twice a week. My issue is with the queue. It is very confusing and frustrating and 90% of the time they don't bring us our food. I never know if I should wait at the front or if they are going to bring it to the table. They give us a number so I assume they are to bring it to us, however they ALWAYS forget a part of our order. SOOO frustrating! Please work on this! I always go up and let them know, and they don't even apologize. We love the food, and will still continue going, but it has become a joke between my husband and I...what will they forget this time."}
{"text":"This is not specific to this location.  I am finding all Paradise locations are 2-star.  They aren't BAD, but they aren't really great either.  The staff here was friendly enough, and was even calling some customers by name (I assumed they were regulars).    On this occasion we got bagels, scones and cookies for a meeting.  OK...the scones were really good.  I gotta give them credit.  They were very popular at the meeting.  If it was just the scones they'd probably get four stars.  The bagels were \"just bagels\", and they didn't offer us any cream cheese (we made the mistake of assuming it was included, so didn't think to ask for any).  The ones at Einstein Brothers are better, and they include the cream cheese (though you do pay a little more for their \"baker's dozen\", if you buy the cream cheese at Paradise it's about the same).  We ended up getting cream cheese at Einstein because the Paradise was too far away when we realized the error.  They should have asked if we wanted any at Paradise when we were buying the bagels.  Maybe 2.5 stars for the bagels, but deduct a star for neglecting to mention cream cheese.  The cookies taste manufactured.  That's the only way I can express it.  Not like fresh homemade cookies.  Like a machine's interpretation of what a cookie should be.  I am not impressed.  And this isn't the first time.  I think I am done with their cookies.  One star there.  So, overall, that's an average of 2 and 1/6 stars.  Or just 2."}
{"text":"The location is nicer than most. The parking lot can be a disaster with all the old folk and paradise valley mercedes/bmw peeps trying to find the closest spot so they don't have to walk 20 yards.   I normally have good experience here and this time was no different when it came to the customer service. That's always good.  This time the food was terrible. It tasted terrible and my stomach was very very angry with me starting in the car ride home and not ending until I'd spent at least 20 minutes in the bathroom.  New chicken soba noodle whatever the hell...NOT GOOD. It tasted like shit but I forced it down. During my meal I burped and almost threw up. I thought it was bc I was too full of nasty tap water tasting broth. Nope. I'm pretty sure that was my stomach telling me to stop eating it. I didn't listen...and I paid dearly when I got home.  So...if you go, get a salad or a delightful sammy; perhaps a pasta dish. But do not...I repeat, DO NOT get that new broth bowl. What little flavor it had was terrible and the only thing worse was how it made me feel."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch! I usually get the club half sandwich or the Caesar salad. The tomato basil soup here is breath taking! I haven't tried breakfast here yet, but one of these days I will have to. I can never seem to get over the fact the cookies that come with your meal are so delicious and make for a great dessert snack during lunch."}
{"text":"I like to come to Paradise Bakery occasionally because I like the food there and find that you get a lot of it for your $$. This last time we went I tried a salad that I haven't had before and I am in LOVE with it! I had the chinese citrus cashew with chicken salad and a cup of turkey chilli. While the turkey chilli was a bit bland, the salad was everything and then some! It is a perfect blend of fresh and sweet. My husband had a 1/2 roasted turkey, apple & cheddar sandwich and a cup of creamy tomato soup. He liked the sandwich but didn't like it falling apart constantly - too messy to eat, but loved the creamy tomato soup. He had a bag of chips and a soda with his mean and I had baguette and a water. The portions are HUGE, no way is their \"cup of\" a actual cup and the half salad sized are really big too. For $23-ish dollars I cannot complain."}
{"text":"The Ranchero Omelette is what I always get. The sausage is always fresh and the eggs nicely cooked. I'm not a huge fan of franchise breakfast places. However, when in the run, and in new of a quick-nicely and freshly done breakfast, Paradise Bakery does the trick ;)"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and got their salad / 1/2 sandwich combo. Salad was a standard chicken caeser, nothing to write home about. Got the turkey and cranberry sandwich, which was really good. It's kind of pricey (paid just over $11 for the meal with a drink). It's pretty standard food. Nothing super special, but not crap, either. If invited by someone else, I'll go back, but I probably won't be the one to suggest it."}
{"text":"If you're at the mall and hunger strikes, Paradise Bakery is a great option!   First of all, they have cookies that melt in your mouth. I don't know what they do to them but they are perfectly cooked and uncooked all at once. They have just the right amount of chocolate chips or whatever garnish the cookie includes.   Second of all, they have excellent (and huge) sandwiches. My favorites are the club, turkey chipotle wrap, chicken walnut sandwich, tuna and turkey cranberry. Each sandwich is on soft and fluffy bread and has a good assortment of toppings.   Third, their breakfast. Between the yogurt parfait, breakfast sandwiches, granola and muffins, there is something for every appetite. My favorite muffin is the pumpkin chocolate chip.   And fourth, their soups and salads. Their salads come in different sizes and my favorites are the Mediterranean and Southwestern Chicken. Their tomato soup is the perfect option on a cold day."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. First time coming to this restaurant. Ordered a Flatbread and was told they were out. Then ordered a bread bowl of soup was told they were also out of bread bowls. It was only 6pm on a Wednesday. Then everything there is Panera, including the uniforms but they will not take Paneras reward card?? Like seriously. Not worth the trip."}
{"text":"Salads are fresh! I recommend ordering from scratch though. However, if you happen to get there at brunch, you'll have to order a salad off their menu because the line isn't ready for personalized orders."}
{"text":"I love love love, Paradise Bakery. I have had problems before with my phone orders but nothing that couldn't be fixed with a FREE box of cookies.  Customer service is always great and the food is also very yummy.   Being that I'm pregnant I am obsessed with the Turkey bravo BLT (antibiotic free Turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomatoe, on sourdough bread) and a side if their white cheddar Mac and cheese. So yummy!   Be aware that during lunch time it does get very busy and you might be waiting a little while in line.  Take an extra person so they can grab a table before you order.  Also,  since you might be waiting in line get on their free Wi-Fi and check out their menu."}
{"text":"I like lunches there... too bad their coffee is horrible. Someone needs to tell them to stop brewing their coffee at 170F and to get some decent beans to use. You must wait 10 minutes to be able to drink the coffee just ot get it to cool down... they are clueless."}
{"text":"Great food, free Wi-Fi, and friendly folks - can't beat it! Give the Mediterranean Egg White sandwich a try in the morning, great wake-up dish!"}
{"text":"Great service,  awesome food! Love being able to meet for business & dine with Wi-Fi! Great for business!"}
{"text":"well, where do I begin...I work in the mall at Fashion Square and went here every day.  My average bill was 6.00 a day and my co workers as well went there each and every day for work.  we were pleased that they opened early as we do at times for store set up...well, we are offered free refills all day and this particular day I started work at 730 am and one of my co workers went to get our drinks...when I went back at 930 to get my refill the gal Andrea whispers something to the sweet gal Daniel right in front of me an then approaches me to tell me that she will have to charge me because refills are only on the same days.  I said well, it is the same day and she said well I have been here since 530 and you never bought a drink today.  I said that I did and actually my drink was still half full...it did not even dawn on me that I had to explain that someone else bought it for me...boy, was I insulted...I immediately asked for my refund for my coffee and parfait and vowed never to patronize their store again.  How terrible that I was humiliated in front of other people.  Why don't they come up with a more civilized system to assure people do not attempt to get a refill on another day and those whom are legitimate are not felt as if they stole something.  TERRIBLE!!!  Andrea, please- learn to speak better to people.  You and your manager on two separate occasions have shown very poor customer service.  I feel as if you both are very prejudice to me.  I am sorry,  but I took it very personal."}
{"text":"It's nice, like most Paradise Bakeries. Parking anywhere in the area sucks though."}
{"text":"Feels just like the other Paradise Bakeries I've been to. Nice, clean, food tastes the same."}
{"text":"Always good tasting food here, but the ordering is something to be improved upon. Ordering at this Paradise is very disjointed and because of this the employees can seem a bit rude. I recommend to the management to have one spot to order rather than 4 different areas to order without great signage."}
{"text":"I have loved this place for years, but I may never go back after tonight. I ordered 2 adult meals and 1 kids meal to go, and it took FOREVER. When I got home, I discovered they didn't give me any dressing for my greek salad and they shorted me a cookie. I was not happy at all!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Their sandwiches are some of the best. The salads are filling and always fresh. Even the soups are great. Portion size is awesome and the price isn't too bad, a little on the expensive side but pay for what you get."}
{"text":"I am officially throwing my Paradise reward card away.  I have never in my life seen so many rude and unhappy employees.  I felt I was putting them out by being there.  Between the \"I only take the sandwich order\" and \"I don't do the soup\" with an attitude, to the cashier treating us like we were stupid, I can find many other places to spend my money.   The food was maybe 3 stars but for what it is, it is way over priced.  The only friendly employee in the place was the busboy.  The place is busy but I fail to see why."}
{"text":"COOKIES!! Most likely you'll only find yourself at this place if you're in downtown Phoenix on business or at the convention center for a show, but they have these incredibly delicious chocolate chip cookies.  A coworker brought us a bunch back and they were soooo good!  Bottom line: Great chocolate chip cookies are a weakness of mine and the cookies from this place are like kryptonite to me."}
{"text":"For me, Paradise Bakery is a poor man's Panera. I don't think it's nearly as organized, friendly or tasty as Panera, although the price is much better at Paradise.  Paradise Bakery is disappointing in a few ways. First, I really really hate when places just have pictures of sandwiches on the display board and provide absolutely zero written description. Oh, I see I'm just supposed to guess what is on that sandwich that has a picture in the most inconvenient spot in the whole freaking place. Wonderful. Second, the caesar salad is horrible. I took my first bite yesterday and instantly remembered why I swore I would never order another one from Paradise again. I managed to choke most of it down, but seriously what is wrong with their caesar dressing??? It has a very funny, and not in a good way, taste to it. Also the croutons are not very tasty either. Third, they completely use too much dressing on their salads. Excuse me, but can I have some lettuce to go with that dressing?? And finally, for a bakery, I don't particularly find the cookies and pastries I have tried to be all that amazing. The chocolate/white chocolate chip cookie I tried yesterday was a bit on the dry side and not very chewy/soft at all. Boo.  The two bright spots are 1) the price...my salad and medium drink was $6.23 which isn't a bad deal at all and 2)the number of tables outside this location where you can escape the office to enjoy a nice, leisurely lunch on a beautiful Arizona day. But if you are craving a salad or sandwich, there are better options in the downtown area."}
{"text":"10 months later, this place is now Panera and I went in to give it another shot.  I thought MAYBE with Panera taking over there would be new management in place and things may improve but I was wrong.  I gave it a try today, went in at 11:35 (before the lunch rush), ordered a salad and soup and AGAIN it was slow, slow, slow it took 25 minutes for me to get my food and get out of there!  It's unbelievable how many people are standing around when there are long lines of people waiting (at least 20 in line).  What made it worse is that the ONE person who was running the register was also the same person who was serving up soup which was incredibly frustrating and SLOW.  What is the problem?  Why can't they get it together here?  I love the food but the whole experience of ordering and getting it is horrible.  So disappointing."}
{"text":"I visited this spot twice on a recent visit to Phoenix and it was pretty good.   -Breakfast Croissant Sandwich - very good.  It's really hard to go wrong with buttery bread, eggs and cheese.  They give you a good amount of egg, which is also nice and makes it quite a hearty sandwich.  -Hot Chocolate - very good as well.  They basically use milk and Ghirardelli chocolate and it was actually pretty good.  Adding whipped cream on top made it a bit too creamy of a hot chocolate and lost a bit of the chocolate flavor so without whipped cream, this was a great way to have a warm and sweet drink.  -Chocolate Chip Cookie - this was okay.  It honestly didn't taste too original to me and it had a lot more sugar than was necessary.  I'd be curious about trying the other cookies...the Chocolate w/ White Chocolate Chips looked pretty good.  -Yogurt Parfait - this was alright too.  It was a bit too sweet - sweetened yogurt with sweetened granola.  I think most places have it this way, but I prefer less sweet or plain yogurt with sweetened granola and fruits.  Also there were only two small slices of strawberries in my parfait...adding more would have made it better.  This place has a ton of options and is in a great location inside a cool shopping area."}
{"text":"How do you run out of all your brewed teas at dinner time (5pm) on a Saturday? Food was as expected, service was so-so. Looks like the other reviews were right on. This location could be better kept to keep up with the rest of the brand. I won't be going to this location again."}
{"text":"I've been to several PBs in the Valley.  They are always pretty good and very consistent.  I liked my mandarin orange muffin Sunday morning.  I wish they'd get with the trend and offer a green iced tea option at some point."}
{"text":"Went in with my two young boys and got two kids meals - the grilled cheese and mac and cheese meals.  We've had these at other Paradise Bakery locations and it's great.  Here, the portions were very small.  When I picked up the order I made a comment about this and the employee said, \"Yea, we use different sized cups and bread here.  Other people have mentioned this.\"  I asked to speak with a manager, was told that one was there, and then sat down.  My 2 year old finished the $5 mac and cheese meal quick and was still hungry.  The portion was not adequate for a 2 year old.  The cheese sandwich was small too. The manager chose not to come to our table."}
{"text":"Good spot for lunch or when you need to kill some time and need free wi-fi. I'm addicted to the soup in bread bowls. Tends to get backed up and crowded at lunch time, but that's to be expected."}
{"text":"Stop by for the occasional cookie.  Being a cookie snob, Paradise had one of the only decent cookies I'd eat.  Found out they've changed to a Panera, but a sign on the door said they had the same Paradise cookies.  I think not.  Cookies were severely lacking, and definitely not the same caliber.  I think they're messing with the ingredients to cut costs/increase uniformity.  The famous chocolate chip cookie tasted like something from Costco.  Not impressed, and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my second visit here in 2 weeks and the last. I have had the same cashier Amanda twice. First time I was here, we gave her our order she repeated back and somehow a sandwich was missing from order. I had to go back up and buy the grilled cheese again which now wasn't in a combo and cost almost 7 dollars and was tasteless. No apology, just a dead stare. Today we order. Her again. No smile, no hi. We order, pay and she takes off. No drink cup. Someone else finally gives it to me. Our food comes and the coffee drink my niece ordered still isn't her. The guy says he will tell them. He doesn't. Almost done with our food and my niece goes up to ask about coffee. They say they will bring it. 10 minutes later Amanda comes out with drink that isn't right. I don't even bother to say anything. I just will never come back"}
{"text":"I seem to be hanging out in chains lately... and none of them are blowing me away!  This location of Paradise Bakery has one special thing going for it - they have frozen yogurt!  (I don't think any of the other locations have fro yo).  Other than that, this Paradise Bakery is pretty standard.    Located right near the fountains in \"the District\" area of Desert Ridge (not far from the AMC Theater), you can get consistently ordinary sandwiches and salads here.  I usually go with the walnut chicken salad sandwich or salad - their multigrain bread is not bad but their salad dressings and additional toppings are not anything special.  Pretty average actually...  Paradise Bakery is getting an extra star (increasing my rating from 3 to 4) because they offer cookie cakes that are awesome!  With a couple of hours notice, they will customize your cookie cake and it's always a hit at a party... recently, we ordered a cookie cake for my friend Shauna's birthday - it not only looked adorable, but tasted great too!  Go for the cookies - not necessarily the food!"}
{"text":"This is one of their nicer locations, with outdoor seating around a lovely fountain.   Paradise Bakery offers fresh, well-priced sandwiches, soups, and salads.   Oh, and bakery items.  I love the walnut-chicken salad and the pasta salads. The cookies are just OK in my opinion.  Last time we were there we made a meal of the pesto dip and a whole loaf of crusty bread. Delish!"}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery &Cafe at The Falls at Ocotillo is always -- always -- busy. That's usually a sign of greatness in a restraunt. Unfortunately, in Southwest Chandler, it's more a sign of the dearth of quality eating establishments... but I digress.   At Paradise Bakery, all of the menu items are made fresh daily, and it shows. The service is generally good, although sometimes the staff still seems unprepared for the crowds. My favorite menu item is Irish oatmeal served in an oatmeal-cookie bowl. Try it. It's much better than the overrated croissants and muffins."}
{"text":"Quality of food has changed drastically.  The Sierra sandwich looked like something you make at home with packaged deli meat.  The baked potato soup had zero taste. It's just a white soup.  It was gross.  I was really disappointed with this lunch.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Paradise was my go to place when I wanted a great sandwich or cup of soup, but lately their sandwiches are very mediocre.  They're pretty tasteless, messy and twice they couldn't make the sandwich I selected because they didn't have the right bread or some of the ingredients.  My hubby ordered a sandwich and asked for bacon, which they did charge xtra for, but was not in his sandwich when they brought it out to him.  There location in Goodyear is pretty run down too!  Booth seats are very worn, the soda bar area is not as tidy and clean.  I think its time for a major revamp, please don't be another restaurant that has fallen by the way side.  With a new Harkins around the corner you want to bring in more customers who will keep coming back.  Shape up!!"}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery has been going downhill in recent years and this location doesn't offer anything to change that perception. They do seem to stay fairly busy at this location, which unfortunately means there are often long lines for service. That service can be hit or miss, and the quality of the salad or sandwich you end up can vary greatly depending on who makes it.  Although they stake their reputation on their baked goods, I've never really been a fan. I especially dislike the cookies. Some might describe them as moist, but I they seem overly soggy to me and I prefer a crispier texture.  I used to like Paradise Bakery a great deal when it came to their breakfast menu, but that is no longer the case. They changed the menu a couple of years ago and it seems that they also dramatically changed the quality of their food. If you order a meal with bacon, be prepared for two dark strips that may be bacon or fried shoelaces - your guess is as good as mine."}
{"text":"This location is now Panerra Bread and the customer service is now horrible. Myself and my girlfriend stood in front of the register while a manager tried to get someone else who was busy to try to help us for like 10 minutes. When she finally got someone that person was so irritated that she had to stop what she was doing to help us that she shoo shed me when I tried to make my order because she was not ready!!! I almost lost it!!"}
{"text":"This half decent sandwich place has gone from so so to bad in terms of food quality and quantity after Panera bought it. Expect to get sandwich that is about 2.5\" square when you order you pick 2 and pay about 9 bux for it. the three different soups we ordered were super salty.  Staff were generally bad when we went - may be lull after the busy lunch... they medded up all three of our orders. They were not very helpful, nor they offered to fix. Let Panera know, got a boiler plate that they take my comments very seriously.. whatever, I am not going there again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's Paradise Valley Mall or Paradise Bakery itself but it seemed kind of run down.  I was super excited to eat here since so many have switched to Panera.  I always order the chicken salad sandwich.  It wasn't as good as I've come to expect.  The girls behind the counter weren't very organized either.  This sure wasn't what we've come to expect from Paradise Bakery.  Next time I'll go to Subway."}
{"text":"Love their black ice tea and cookies.  Chocolate chip is my favie.  Their sandwiches and soups are great too.    Con - It is pain looking for a seat after you get all our food."}
{"text":"Was trying to sneak breakfast in before heading to work again.  Got the basic breakfast sandwich and an ice tea.  The ice tea was probably freshly brewed so the ice melted quick.  The sandwich was very bland.  I remember they use to have yummy tasty food.  Oh well.  Back to work..."}
{"text":"This is like a Panera, has mostly the same menu as Panera, yet I did not like it as well as I like Panera.  I had a half shrimp soba noodle salad. Usually the half salads are pretty big, but not the case here. It came in a small cup. The soba noodles were dry and gummy. It came with 4 pieces of shrimp and cost $7.99.   Ordering was difficult. If you're getting a sandwich, you have to give your order to a sandwich order taker, who writes it on paper. If you get a salad or soup, you have to go further down the line. This was confusing especially because the woman who took our sandwich order was not clear about what we needed to do, as though this is standard operating procedure at all restaurants. So, I had my son two stations down ordering soup, my daughter and I at another station ordering salad and then trying to get a kids' order and a sandwich order from the sandwich person."}
{"text":"Ambient - Casual   Service - Quick, Friendly and Easy.  Food - I enjoy their chocolate chip cookeis and their Chicken Walnut Salad Sandwich.  Although one thing that I do not like is that their soups are not made their fresh.  They are good, but somehow I expected that they made their own soups. :-/"}
{"text":"I went here for a light breakfast with one of my friends who is a frequent visitor. We order the crossaint sandwichm strawberry yogurt parfait and chai tea lattes with soy.   I really liked the parfait and the chai tea. The crossaint was good but nothing you could not get anywhere else. The neat thing is there is a loyalty program for frequent visitors."}
{"text":"A good coffee shop should have good coffee and tea, good vibe, and good treat and sweets. At this Paradise Bakery the coffee and environment is good and they have a good selection of teas including english breakfast, earl grey, mango ceylon, peach ginger... Also they have a wide selection of healthy food including sandwiches, salad and soup. Unfortunately the selection of sweets are mostly cookies, muffins, and scones, overly sweet and nothing exotic. There are some annoyances like their machines show they accept Apple Pay but the POS is behind the counter and the server didn't even know about it, or I asked for hot tea but the water in tea flask was lukewarm. There is a backroom if you want to study or a quiet place, and outdoor seating for cool days too."}
{"text":"Keifer was the saving grace when we visited. He was the only person to greet us of about ten front counter workers and that includes two obvious managers. He apologized for our wait as they were organizing orders and getting prepped for the day.   The people immediately behind us (4 people) and the couple behind them walked out before ordering due to the wait.   Oatmeal was good - had it plain with cinnamon topper. My fiancee had the croissant breakfast sandwich. Croissant was light and fluffy while the ham had a smoky flavor. The cheese was what you'd expect cheese to be but the egg was a touch on the dry side. Overall a good breakfast option - definitely re-order worthy.   Note: when they brought food to the table they did offer us complimentary cookies for waiting in line and for the food. So that helped bring it back a notch!  Overall: B+  will come back"}
{"text":"I dropped by for lunch yesterday.  DIsappointed.   Clearly the line was slow, but no effort was made to send in more salad makers.   Or to say, 'sorry folks'.  And then suddenly the check out is backed up too! I started asking if they could bring in another checker. I was ignored. On my third request, (when I asked for a manager) a girl said they had trouble with their computer.  And she said the manager was busy.   It wasn't just the slowness, it was the lack of apologizing or management concern.  \"management?\", it appeared there was none.   Just a bunch of kids doing their jobs, but no one looking at the big picture.   Appears to have gone downhill since the effective merger.   PS- Salad girls: a smile would help!"}
{"text":"come here a lot for lunch or sometimes for dinner if we are in the mood for a sandwich... usually it doesnt take long to get your food (i get it togo most of the time) but there are times where i have waited way to long for my food and is not even a lunch time rush. i really think they work harder and faster only during the rush. Went there a 2 weeks ago for a gift card for my boss and i decided to get a sandwich and salad while i finished my christmas shopping. it was not packed at all and it looked like all the employees were 16 years old and training. it took over 15 minutes to get my to go food and all i ordered was half sandwich and salad and a kids mac & cheese. it wasn't even packed and i was waiting right by the counter the whole time. most of the time its fast but this was just horrible"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a snack, so I'm only reviewing based on their cookies.  The place reminds me of a Panera Bakery for some reason. We went in to get a snack and we saw the nibblers? or whatever you call the small cookies. oatmeal choc chip and choc cookie with white choc chips. These little cookies were awesome. We only ordered a dozen but we somehow ended up with over 20, the worker just didnt care of felt nice.   I also asked for two white choc macadamia large cookies. Much later, I was disappointed to learn they had given me peanut butter cookies. disgusting..  so the extra cookies and the cookie swap cancel each other out and I am not upset."}
{"text":"Easily the worst experience I have ever had at paradise bakery. Went here for lunch with my husband and 1 year old. About 4 to-go people in front of me waiting for food when we walked in. Placed our order and then proceeded to wait 28 minutes to get our food. Only 6 orders (both to-go and diners) received their orders before me, so it wasn't like there was a long line waiting for food ahead of us. There were also 8 people behind the counter, 3 taking orders and 5 making the orders, but the people making the orders seemed to run into each other, and kept making orders and then realizing the order was already filled, and then throwing away the food.  This used to be a quick spot to grab a bite to eat during lunch and get a semi-healthy option for our toddler, but definitely no longer. I would not recommend anyone eat here unless they are prepared to wait a half hour or longer. The line to place orders was out the door when we left."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Arizona on vacation for a wedding. The food was better than the average deli and they give you a free cookie with your order too. It is a shame they don't have these in malls near me. Although I read on their website that they have one at the Galleria which would have been nice when I lived in Davis, CA for college.   Shopping really works up an appetite and this satisfied it well. and light enough not to ruin a dinner as we had a wedding to attend later that evening."}
{"text":"They have the most unhappy employees that I have ever seen in my life. The restaurant was filthy and I couldn't find a clean table to sit at. After asking a cashier to clean one nobody came over so I cleaned one myself with a napkin. Meanwhile I noticed 5 employees sitting down chatting in the restaurant and watching me clean the table. Management needs to make their employees have pride in their job because everyone is miserable. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I can see I'm not the first one to have felt that way."}
{"text":"Over priced, over rated!  $50 dollars for soup?! Wow The lines to order are very confusing, customer service is not that great. They have been bought out by Panera now, but it's not an improvement."}
{"text":"Man this place is good!  Bring it to Vegas, please?  Came for lunch, ended up getting a bunch of cookies, too.  Their cookies are soooo good.  Everything is very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place used to be a 5, I used to tell everyone if they go to Phoenix you have to go to paradise bakery. The portions are generous, the food is good, and the cookies are great.   Not anymore.  Someone must have bought this company out because it has corporate greed all over it now. Ordered a half salad. The bowl was half full and it ha a quarter of an avocado. Tr soup was barely 3/4 full and the bread it came with was borderline stale. They also charge for \"premium\" stuff, and literally everything on the menu is \"premium\".  It is maybe average Panera quality now there.   Really disappointing. I used to really like this place."}
{"text":"Menu changed. Why change something that Was good. Roasted tomato basil soup is now flavorless creamy tomato soup. Yuck! Won't be back."}
{"text":"Owned by Panera, this place has all of the things I love! Soups, sandwiches, bagels, treats and decent pricing. Clean, easy to get in and out of, the only issue I found was where do I order? Where do I pay? Do I leave my dishes or do they clean up behind me? Maybe I missed the signs but it seemed they could do a better job of directing traffic so to speak?"}
{"text":"The staff at this location are more than a little helpless. They don't know how to ring up purchases, don't properly order your food and are less than friendly.   I was there for lunch just now and was shocked by the lack of service. My friend ordered mac and cheese with her salad and had to ask three different times about the mac and cheese to no avail. The mac and cheese finally came out about fifteen minutes later! That's just crazy.  When checking out, the cashier did not know how to ring up our food and was unable to locate the appropriate icons for the food. And we didn't order anything special or extraordinary... everything we ordered was straight off the menu without modifications.  To top it off, the location is a little out of the way if you work downtown, and the interior is cramped and poorly laid out. Don't expect this to be a quick lunch stop... the line moves slow and the staff even slower.  The only person in the entire restaurant that knew what was going on was a nice man named Brian. He was the one that had to help the cashier figure out how to ring up the food and personally made our mac and cheese. Without him we might have perished for waiting. He should get a promotion to trainer! Excellent customer service and attitude. He even offered us free cookies for the wait!   Paradise Bakery is moderate food to begin with, but pair it with the poor service and mediocre location and that food becomes overpriced nonsense.   There is obviously an issue with poor management, otherwise this wouldn't be happening. This location really needs to work on properly training their staff and improving the efficiency of the \"line.\"  Until they do, they get one VERY GENEROUS, nay, yelp protocol obligatory, star."}
{"text":"I love Paradise Bakery, just not this one. On too many occasions have they messed up my order or not had key ingredients for main sandwhiches. I keep returning based on convenient location to my home but no more.   Save your money for another location or different restaurant."}
{"text":"Always great sandwich and salads. A bit pricey for kids meals. Quick ordering. Nice and clean. Service good"}
{"text":"I just paid $8 for a grilled cheese the size of a hotdog bun. I couldn't get the half because they were out of every side. The service was pretty awful as well. I understand it's an airport and won't be inexpensive, but Panera should be embarrassed that they own this place."}
{"text":"As they make the change to the new business model, the customer service is getting worse. The wait time times are longer, the staff,  less pleasant, the mistakes, more frequent.   No longer are you greeted with a smile and a hello but with dissatisfied glance and then they turn their back to you.   I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Affordable, fresh and delicious.  Like Rob said, everything is sooooo reasonably priced, a nice find in this area of flashy new resturants.    The breakfast croissant was HUGE and yummy and their chai latte beats my fav starbucks.  The breakfast wrap is a great low carb breakfast and the yogurt parfait was very good.    Service was beyond helpful.    Ambiance surprisingly reminiscent of  Panera Bread. Same designer?  Phoenix, you are so lucky!  Please let us have one of these in the Bay Area?  Heck, please let us have one in every city!  Such good food for the money.  A definite must."}
{"text":"What happen paradise bakery was such a great place   Meat on the sandwiches  1/3 less Bread is day old Cookies have a different taste Everything is less quality and less value A favorite of mine for 10 plus years  Now in search of a new quality lunch spot in Scottsdale  Really a shame I don't know what happen?"}
{"text":"How tough can it be to make sandwiches in the airport?  Out of tuna salad?  Then a guy skips the line, walks in front of me and asks for an iced tea, cash. They jack around behind the counter and finally give the jerk a free iced tea and he walks away smugly. After that I wait 15 minutes for a chicken salad sandwich.  Service was surly, food was overpriced. Other than that I had a great experience...  To be fair, the sandwich was good sized (see photo below), but the chicken was not cleaned well and I encountered an unchewable piece of gristle. Ewwww."}
{"text":"What a complete mess. They have several people behind the counter to \"assist\" you with your order and make sure you get through fast, but they have ZERO personnel clearing and cleaning tables. There is a table I am staring at as I have been here for an hour that hasn't had anyone sitting in it since I've been here but hasn't been cleared or cleaned. This is completely ridiculous how they have so much staff, yet so inefficient in how they staff. The management and parent company need to review their staffing."}
{"text":"The food is usually good  and most of the staff are friendly.  Had a bad experience with a counter person there once, she was very rude, if you hate your job, you should quit.  But other than that the low-fat raspberry muffins are my fav.    **Update:  Went there today and had their new summer salad.  Might as well have gone to mcdonalds for a salad, not great.  Service was better this time."}
{"text":"They have the best oatmeal cookies.  It is not your typical oatmeal cuz it's more crispy and have a lot of texture.  Their soups are soooo hearty, especially their chicken noodle soup!! Not those bland watery soup tasting ones!!"}
{"text":"I work in Scottsdale Fashion Square so I frequent this location often. The service is usually pretty good but of course during the lunch rush the lines can get very backed up. Sometimes when this location gets unexpectedly busy and there is only one person on sandwiches and soups the wait can get pretty long, I'm talking 10 to 15 minutes for your food which is a long time when you only have a half hour break.   Paradise Bakery has fairly healthy options depending on what you get. I enjoy the half bacon turkey bravo with a cup of chicken noodle soup. The broccoli cheddar soup is also very good along with the paradise club on a croissant. The salads have some what gone down in quality since the menu has changed in the fall. I do not like the way that the chicken is just plopped on top of the salad in a to go box and the chicken looks stuck together and not appetizing. Overall it is still the best choice for healthy on the go eating in Scottsdale Fashion Square but it has it's hits and misses."}
{"text":"Normally I love this location but today I ordered a salad and the women was so rude!!! She laughed at me while ordering my food, will probably never go back."}
{"text":"Ordered the tuna. Was told there's no option not to get a cookie. Really, not even a carrot stick? Ordered a side of fruit. Didn't get it. The tuna was watery brown mayonnaise goo. Had a similar experience here a couple of years ago."}
{"text":"I spend work time here at Paradise Bakery Desert Ridge - I like its free wifi, (even though PB has started clamping down on lunch work - 30 minutes only between 11am-1pm). Its food is always tasty and the coffee is scrumptious.  But last Friday, during a long chat with a pal, the Desert Ridge associate Dillon was awesome during our visit - he offered us coffee and tea refills, and brought us back each in new cups - very unexpected and very welcome (we were in a long work discussion). Kudos to him for friendliness and service! Highly recommended.   One drawback? The room has only 1 (maybe 2?) outlets to plug in laptop work. But then again, it's a cafe, not Gangplank, right? :-)"}
{"text":"Back to this location and more issues. Here's the thing, even if you're not on soup duty, when you see people waiting in line for soup, don't walk past them and go into the kitchen. Help the customers! All these teenagers are always coming in and out of the back when it's busy."}
{"text":"On our way to the movie theater, we decided to grab a quick breakfast. Fortunately, it was late enough (9:50am) that there wasn't a line. Since I normally do not eat breakfast at Paradise Bakery, I had to hang back and take in the menu. Luckily, the employees were really nice and waited while I decided. After ordering, our food came quickly. I ordered the Asiago breakfast sandwich - bacon, egg, and Vermont white cheddar on a bagel. I subbed for a plan bagel with no hassle. It was relatively inexpensive and filling. I'd order it again if I was ever in the area for breakfast. My husband ordered a slice of coffee crumb cake - it was delicious! Soft and tasty with a nice crunchy topping. This is a great place for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Love some of their food choices and that they have wifi so I can study here. For the most part the employees are friendly, efficient and hardworking. I'm not as impressed by the fact that the teen children of one if the employees are here every time I come in seated in the best booth in the house, or worse, in multiple booths EATING FOOD FROM OTHER RESTAURANTS!"}
{"text":"Three of our group in here this morning for breakfast. Everything was ok. Nothing great. Two of us had omelets. I had a ham, swiss, croissant. Nothing great here. I did have a real good Americano drink. Would not return for breakfast."}
{"text":"I prefer wildflower, but recently had their grilled cheese and tomato soup and it was delicious!!  Will be back for that combo!"}
{"text":"Great for breakfast or lunch. My experience at this Paradise Bakery has always been good with service and food. I've met up with friends, taken kids, had meetings here. Works all the time."}
{"text":"3 out of the 5 times I've come here, they have taken  way too long to make a sandwich. I had my soup and salad while I was paying and my boyfriend and his kid's sandwich took almost 20 minutes to be made and brought out. It's. A. Sandwich."}
{"text":"Finally got my best friend to go to the gym with me but her pre-workout meal was a gas station donut so needless to say we needed sustenance pronto once we were done. In the spirit of health we decided some salads from Paradise Bakery would probably be among our best options for lunch.  There really wasn't a line when we arrived at noon on a Wednesday, maybe 1-2 people so we were helped right away. My friend decided on the Sesame Chicken and she's quite the picky eater so she had several changes she made to the salad but the person helping didn't give her a hard time about it. I ordered for myself the half size Fuji Apple Chicken salad.  Once we got to the cashier I noticed they had smoothies that looked pretty good from the descriptions. Since I've been busting my butt lately to lose weight I've been very conscious of calories so I asked if they knew how many were in the smoothies. Rather than just guessing the girl actually went and found the nutrition facts for me so I could see everything. I was so impressed that she went out of her way to do that when most people would have guessed or not even tried to figure it out. Kudos to her, wish I'd caught her name!  The salad and smoothie were AMAZING!! If I wasn't in a public place I probably would have licked the bowl clean. The sweet and savory flavor combination in the salad was so different and delicious. The super fruit smoothie was nice and refreshing without being too sweet and you could taste a hint of the yogurt which I personally like.  Overall I was very happy with not only the good but the service at this location."}
{"text":"Nice place with good service.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich with the seasons jalapeño and cheese bagel, I really expected a bit more punch. After all, when you go jalapeño your venturing on the wild side... Not the mild side."}
{"text":"Rolled in from out of town and just wanted a simple bagel and coffee. I didn't know that this was under the same \"umbrella\" as Panera bread. Nice surprise. Delicious and consistent however keep in mind a little pricier than, Einstein bros. for example. But nice inside, clean etc."}
{"text":"I met up with several ladies here during lunch to discuss some party planning ideas over the weekend. The back room was the perfect location. Free wifi to pull up some pinterest ideas on our tablets, just quiet enough for us to talk comfortably, and we didn't feel rushed. FIVE STARS!  After a bit, we all got up and ordered our food. Two of the ladies ordered the Big Kid's Grilled Cheese and were surprised. That sandwich was definitely NOT for big kids! No special flavors, no fancy bread, and isn't there supposed to be bacon? Both were disappointed, specifically my mother-in-law whose sandwich was half burnt, half not grilled at all. ONE STAR.  I got the Paradise Club and I felt like I was kind of gypped with the small amount of deli meat on my sandwich, but was still satisfied. TWO AND A HALF STARS?  Deep in discussion, we didn't even notice when an employee came by and cleaned off our table and plates. I love when that happens. FIVE STARS.  Overall, I'll give you guys three stars. Maybe I'll stick to the PV Mall location."}
{"text":"They have changed to Panera.  Everything is an extra charge.  The food is okay at best. I loved the chocolate chip cookies from Paradise, they don't taste the same.  Super disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Why would I rather spend an afternoon here than the JW Marriott Desert Ridge Resort and Spa?  Because they have FREE wifi here!  The baked goods aren't bad either.  Yes, as I previously mentioned, the resort wanted me to PAY for WIRED internet.  Instead, I drove across the street and bought an iced coffee here (roughly 4 bucks) and enjoyed free wifi.  Even though I didn't have anything really important to do (in fact, I think I wrote a review while I was there...) it was nice feeling connected.  So that's what an addiction to the internet feels like.  I got some sort of frozen mint chip coffee.  Nothing spectacular, but nothing terrible.  The bakery is in the middle of the outdoors mall there.  Across the way is a Starbucks.  Odd that they can cohabitate, but both seem to be doing good business.  I did not try any of the sandwiches or salads, but I'm sure they would have tasted fine.  This chain reminds me of Panera bread in San Jose; they basically sell the same things.  There are some bar tables near the register and booths in the rest of the dining area.  Just be forewarned: if you are bringing a laptop, be sure to have your battery charged.  There is ONE outlet near the outer door next to the bathroom that you could reach from a table, but not the booths.    My friend who came with me had his laptop die.  Me, being the GRACIOUS friend, allowed him to use my laptop to finish his homework assignment.  That's just the kind of buddy I am =)"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this place, I promise myself that I'm not going to waste my money here anymore. But it's just so darn convenient to where I work and it has wi-fi so I can do schoolwork over my lunchbreak.   Pros: Wi-fi. Healthy options. Great cookies. Close to my work (but you don't care about that!)   Cons: It's way overpriced. When I first moved to AZ I loved this place because the sandwiches were crazy-huge and the salads were overflowing and they had free cookie samples! It could be because I used to visit a different (Central Phoenix) location, but I think that general management has cut portion size by a LOT. My salads don't even come close to filling up the bowl now, much less to overflowing, and you're lucky if your turkey sandwich has as much meat on it as a Subway sandwich. Also, they're constantly messing up my order. And I'm not talking about picky orders, I'm talking about getting mayo when i ask for none, or being charged for a whole sandwich when I ordered a half because they wrote it down wrong (I order the half and half special!) These aren't big deals really but it's annoying when at least half of the time your order isn't right.  I know, I know. I should just stop coming here, right?! But, like I said, it's way too convenient to drive a couple of minutes and get some homework done so I can actually have some free time (what's that?!) in the evenings.   If I have extra time to drive to the Wildflower at Chandler Mall, believe me, I do."}
{"text":"Thank You ASHLEY in catering. Called in this morning with last minute lunch order plus needed delivered by 11am and she made it all happen seamlessly. Then she called me to tell me it was delivered and set up( i was not on site)...amazing service. This Paradise will marked as fav for ALL orders in the area."}
{"text":"love paradise bakery. but it seems to me everyone that works at this location is high....just saying lol"}
{"text":"What bad things could I have to say about a place that gives you a yummy free cookie with your order? Pretty much nothing darn straight! Umm did I mention cookie was one of my first words?  Most Paradise Bakeries are located in shopping areas around the Valley, and they make a healthy option to any ones hunger pains in the mall. This location IS ALWAYS BUSY! I swear every time I go or see it people are swarming around. Paradise Bakery offers sandwiches, salads, desserts, and soups. I have to say everything I have tried has been delicious! The combo of half a sand which and soup or salad is a really great deal. The portions are nice and filling which means me and my boyfriend can eat here and he won't leave hungry!  I also love their free samples located on the side of the ordering booth by the stairs. Another int resting tidbit of information: they also have a paradise bakery cafe located on the other side of the food court!  My Suggestions: Albacore Tuna Sandwich combo with tomato soup Club Croissant Sandwich Tomato and Mozzarella Sandwich Southwest Caesar Salad  Also you can customize the type of free cookie you get, just ask!"}
{"text":"I have been to PB before for lunch.  The salads  were good as  well as the sandwiches.  Tried this location  for breakfast. Bagel, stale. Sausage egg cheese on ciabatta...sausage so  bad i took off the sandwich after one bite.  Egg cheese fine. Cookies were still good. Avoid PB for breakfast."}
{"text":"This location is the most frustrating to go to it doesn't matter what you tell them when you order it they make whatever is the standard no apologies just have to keep showing them your receipt until they get it right managers are no help only place to go for lunch if you want to get a hard time and get stressed"}
{"text":"Update.  Even though I had to return to this location to receive a full refund, the manager on duty acquiesced and offered me a free dinner.  I did not accept any free food, but I did receive an email from Panera informing me that they would be more than happy to mail me a gift certificate as a \"gesture of goodwill.\"    Even though their initial service is less than stellar, it appears as though Paradise/Panera is committed to improving their customer service.    Their attempts to rectify my issue are admirable."}
{"text":"Awesome!  The best run Paradise in the Valley.  Everyone that works here is so helpful and courteous.   The menu is super diverse and not too pricey.  I've ate lunch there several times....love the 1/2 sandwich and soup combo.   Great value and just right amount of food.   The cheese broccoli soup is super."}
{"text":"We've been here quite a few times, and it's a pretty good location. I'd say it's about the same as all of the other locations I've been to, though... nothing special, but it's nothing worse either.  The only complaint I've had is that their iced tea doesn't seem that good here. I'm a tea snob though, as I love all types of tea hot and cold. Could just be me... but the same flavours at other locations seemed to taste better, and this has been several occasions that I've noticed.  Also, as for the changes at Paradise, that is happening at all locations... another company bought them out and are changing things slowly but surely. Oh, and I still don't like their cookies.... and I love cookies! I just have never liked Paradise cookies for some reason, even though everyone always claims how delicious they are :P"}
{"text":"It's a Paradise. Friendly service and consistent food as per the average Paradise. Perfect for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This is a good pb. You can get healthy food such as soups, salads and sanwiches for a pretty good price. My wife and I and my two kids ate for 22 bucks. My wife and I split a large salad and a half panini and we got two kids turkey and cheese sandwiches. 4 drinks and 3 cookies, which are delicious."}
{"text":"Today was our 154 visit to Paradise Bakeries and perhaps our last. Since they were purchased by Panera Bread everything has gone down hill. Today the coffee was tasteless and weak. Why purchase a great restaurant and change what made it a success?"}
{"text":"I love paradise bakery but this paradise bakery always gets something wrong. First time the person in charge of making food forgot to put chicken in my salad. Second time I got Mac and cheese (which I absolutely love) and it was really gross compared to other times I've had it at other paradise bakery locations. The Mac and cheese was really oily. :( I guess no more paradise bakery in a while until I don't feel grossed out anymore."}
{"text":"Love Paradise Bakery! This location is great. Always fresh and delicious food. Tasty cookies and muffins as well.  My only advice to management is please get regular cream soda instead of diet. Or at least have both."}
{"text":"No more Ranch dressing. No more croissant clubs. No more two for 1 cookies. Smaller portion sizes, same prices. Now that Paradise Bakery is gone. Won't be coming back.  Very disappointing. Use to LOVE Paradise Bakery. This location on a Sunday at noon use to be packed! Now I can see why it was mostly empty."}
{"text":"I like Paradise Bakery, but if you have been to multiple locations or ever the same location multiple times, you know it can be hit or miss depending on who is making the salad. This was the first time that the same person made salads and they were drastically different.  I met someone here for an early dinner/first date and spent time talking and getting to know each other. The restaurant was not busy and provided a good setting for a meeting. After about an hour, we made our way to the line and ordered salad.   The soup maven had to go in the back and fetch the salad lady. My date ordered Greek salad with no onions and no olives, but add chicken. The lady struggled with the successful completion of this challenging  order. She started to add onions until my friend stopped her - then she started to add the olives, again being foiled. She neglected to add the chicken until reminded. My friend's bowl was about half full when completed. She made her way down the line when the salad lady asked for my order. I stuck with an Asian chicken salad (no substitutions or alterations), but then she discovered no tongs - so into the back she went and emerged three minutes later. When completed, I had a heaping bowl of salad.   By this time my date already hit the register, paid for her own salad, picked up the drink and sat down to begin eating. Normally I would have paid for both meals, but the salad delay thwarted my chivalrous attempt... My check out was uneventful and I joined her at the table.  Another issue with the restaurant was the temperature. I can appreciate that this is Arizona and you need AC, but it isn't that hot out now. The temperature must have been set for the dog days of August in the Deep South. It was chilly and she was noticeable cold and shaking. That made for uncomfortable eating and conversation (I am sure it wasn't my company). She finished most of the salad and I maybe hit half before deciding to leave and head for warmer ground.   I know it is a small treat, but the signature item at Paradise Bakery is the chocolate chip cookie. It is a bakery after all. Try the 2 for 1 cookie, stuff your face with a few bites of each free sample or take home a dozen. They are definitely worth it and provide an excellent happy finish to an otherwise healthy meal.  A little more consistency on the salad portions, some fine tuning of the timeliness with the salad preparations and a reasonable temperature would have made the evening more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I like to come here for a light breakfast or lunch. I love the soutwest ceasar salad. Also at times, we like to get a few bagels and make sandwiches at home. But dont come past 9am hoping for a bagel that isnt sweet or a good selections of muffins to choose from bc it wont happen. We have tried several times lately, through the week and on the weekend! No choices past 9. And Im not sure what you would order if you went between 10 and 11, they stop serving breakfast at 10, 10 really??? Yep, reallY!"}
{"text":"This location has gone almost completely Panera, so manage your expectations. I came in for my favorite Paradise Bakery Peach or Mango iced tea, which Panera does not have, and for chippers, which they had but were dry and unappetizing (which was for the best, as I do not need them anyhow)."}
{"text":"The paradise bakery chain is good. But as a former employee there, its because they load everything, including the bread with sugar. At the end of the day they throw out hundreds of cookies, which I would donate the day old cookies to underpriveldged families.  If u call ahead of time, the employees will save the day old pastries and cookies for u if u intend to donate it or contribute it toward a good cause.  All paradise bakeries are busy! The amount of kitchen and walkway space behind the counter is so crowded and gets messy fast. Because it was so busy, we would wait until we closed to clean the dishes. Because we did it all at once, the dishes were cleaned in disgusting brown water. The rags we used to clean knives, tables, chairs and counters were soaked in dirty brown water of \"sanitizing\" buckets on the floor with bits of food floating in them. Because paradise bakery is open so late, until ten or eleven, the workers want to get out of there and would sabotage your food if you came in close to closing time. I saw the workers drop their bread on the floor and soak the plastic salad bowls in the brown water of the \"sanitizing\" buckets.   I stopped working there because I found a job with better pay, but after seeing how gross the conditions were, I never ate there again.  Overall, its unclean, over priced, busy and loaded with sugar....but the food is good."}
{"text":"I love love lava love paradise and panera and I'd definitely give them one more shot but this is my third time getting a frozen drink (Frappuccino) and they charge me almost $5 and don't fill it to the top. They leave it about a whole inch down and try to cover it up with whipped cream :/ I love this place but cmon paradise bakery don't turn into one of those places that completely screws us."}
{"text":"Disappointed that this place doesn't have ONE clean booth to sit in.  And it's far grom busy."}
{"text":"This is nuts. We got into line and ordered sandwiches. We moved forward and asked for soup. The soup guy was a bit rude and told us we should have already ordered soup. We got to the cashier and ordered our drinks. She took our money and told my son that he needed to go back to the front of the line and they would make his drink. His drink took another 15 minutes. We had our food, we had our table and my son spends another 15 minutes to get his drink. It would be so much easier if they had a person at the front if the line taking orders. Food was great. The bizarre ordering process gets this place one star."}
{"text":"I go here all the time...and the fire roasted tomato soup is the most amazing thing ever....and I hate soup.  Go figure.  Anywho, the funny thing that happened today made me realize just how ignorant some of the help could be.  I asked the girl at the counter what comes on the Chicken Artichoke Panini Sandwich and she looked at me strangely and said \"chicken and artichokes.\"  Ok, duh!  Anything else?  Like cheese, tomato, dressing?  \"Oh, let me ask.\"  So she asks the guy that makes the sandwiches what comes on it and he said, \"um, I have no idea.\"  Are you kidding me?  So the manager finally came over and told me everything that was on the sandwich.  Thank you smart lady.   So, while the service is not the best...the sandwich was amazing.  And I always love my free cookie...."}
{"text":"We had dinner here recently, not too busy.  One other customer in line ahead of us.  Our sandwich order was taken very quickly and efficiently by a knowledgeable and very pleasant employee (sorry I don't remember her name).    I've never liked the way you have to go through the entire line before reaching the cashier, even if you are just getting a sandwich, you still have to pace thru the drill at the salad and soup area.  I think the customers in front of us were the reason for the extremely slow service, or maybe there was a new cashier.  Anyway, the wait was starting to feel excessive.    Right about that time, a very sharp manager (Adrian) came to the rescue and opened a 2nd cash register.  I didn't have my Paradise Bakery reward card and asked if he could enter my phone # as alternate id.  Adrian said they are now Panera and all the PB info was gone.  (BTW, big store sign outside and even some inside still say Paradise).  Ok, whatever - I'm ready to pay and move along.  And then I am told by Adrian that he comped my entire meal to make up for the defunct PB reward card.  Wow, that was completely unexpected.  And he even issued a new Panera rewards card to me.    Thanks Adrian, great customer service!  You gained my loyalty and I'll be sure to bring my Panera card with me next time."}
{"text":"I typically like Paradise Bakery. They are usually good for a quick lunch and have healthier options than most of the other \"fast\" places in my area.   This location however, needs some work. The service as always is good, but the food leaves much to be desired. The iced tea is atrocious. I can't exactly pinpoint it, I think the container/brew filters need to be cleaned because the taste is stale. In addition to that, it is completely watered down so you can't taste the mango at all. I actually did a taste comparison to ensure I wasn't losing my mind. After lunch at Paradise Bakery I went to PV Mall and tried the tea at the location there and it was great.   The chicken salad was also huge let down. The strawberries and pineapple were not fresh, they came in heavy sweet syrup. Needless to say I was not in Paradise and will probably pass this place on my way to Wildflower going forward."}
{"text":"Meh I came in on a Friday around 645pm.  Paradise used to be very good but in recent months this location seems to be failing.  Employees yelling across the counter to other employees on break sitting at the table, I ordered a bagel and it was so stale must have been there from yesterday.  Edible but so stale and chewy.  The only other comment I would make is paradise should come up with some sugar free desserts too!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy going to Paradise Bakery and I usually eat there when I'm at Desert Ridge. I'm not sure if that location is going through a transition but the service had gone down. The last few times I've been there my order has been wrong and servers have to ask you multiple times to repeat your order. I was there yesterday and two orders had to be fixed while I was there. I really hope they can turn things around at that location."}
{"text":"Been here a dozen times but been a while since I been here last. I was happy with the food and reminded me this is a good place! I had the half frontega panini and cup of chicken noodle soup. Food came out fast and soup was nice and hot! I also got chocolate chip cookie but I will say it was ok just wish it was more fresh and chewy. Other than that I might come here again soon!"}
{"text":"This location is inside the Scottsdale fashion square. I come here more than often because i work in the mall so for lunch it's perfect. I honestly go through my panera (paradise) cravings.   I usually get the pick two, where you have the choice to pick a half sandwich half soup, or half soup half salad or half sandwich half salad. I always well almost always get the Fuji chicken salad with garden soup. The Fuji salad is actually really good I highly recommend instead of croutons they put apple chips which to me make the entire salad.   Their bagels are really good coffee not so much I don't like none of their coffee selections (I'm picky on my coffee). Their smoothies are good I like their green one.   It's a great place for a quick light lunch and breakfast. They also provide a discount for mall employees which is a huge plus since mall employees tend to eat there a lot!!!      Service is quick as well!"}
{"text":"I like Paradise Bakery and have been to this location several times. Unfortunately I get the name 2 things: garden vegetable soup and blue cheese salad. The reason I get these 2 items is because it's gluten free. I'm shocked and disappointed that Paradise Bakery does not have more options for their GF customers."}
{"text":"I used to love Paradise Bakery. They had such good salads. But the last few times I've eaten there I noticed their food has gone way downhill. It's so bad, I won't be eating there again. Too bad :("}
{"text":"Come here all the time. Never disappointed with the quality of the food, service, and environment. Love the chocolate chip cookies that come with the sandwiches. Always looking forward to each trip to Paradise."}
{"text":"Never going there again. I worked there over 20 years ago. We have enjoyed paradise bakery for over 2 decades. I went tonight and they changed their classic signature muffins; we go for the amazing classic muffin tops. We walked away with nothing tonight and I don't ever plan on going back."}
{"text":"When I got off the light rail this morning, I felt like doing something different.  I've been meaning to come here, but well, I'm tired in the mornings, so I kept blowing this place off.  And its not like I can go after work becuase they close at 4PM!  (WTF is that all about? LAME!)  Anyways, went here and the place is on the second floor.  Had to take the escalator up one flight.  The place is actually pretty big on the inside, with lots of outdoor seating.  I saw a thing that also said they have free wifi? hhhmm.  Interesting.  Anyways, I just wanted something light, so I stood in line. I dont have much time in the mornings to grab anything of serious substance, and I like to keep it light.  They had a nice variety of muffins, crossiants and the such to choose from.  I didnt see any bagels nor did I ask if they had any.  I went with the banana chocolate chip muffin, and it actually tasted pretty good!  They have coffee here too, but I passed.    I dont think they have much else to serve for breakfast besides a few pastries and coffee.  Worth going to again for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I have to find a new friend to go bike (Schwinn, not something cool like a Harley) riding with. This is the second time I have been dragged to a Paradise Bakery at breakfast time. I can't take it anymore. There was a review for another location where the reviewer says it looks when you step in the door that Paradise has promise. That is so true.  When you first walk in and are looking at the bagels, the baked goods, the menu, the purple lights, you almost forget about your last, horrible experience. Have no fear, once the food is served, you quickly remember. I ordered a croissant breakfast sandwich - no ham, and a medium coffee. Seems simple enough. They brought me the sandwich WITH ham. I didn't know when I first bit into it. This ham is still alive, it is so tough, I am sure this is what Wilson rejects for their footballs. What is wrong with you Paradise? Why would you stick a huge slab of tough ham inside a croissant. A croissant that wasn't even toasted. Which brings me to my next comment. You stick an egg on a croissant and you make no attempt to toast the croissant? Even Dunkin Donuts toasts the croissant. You have no clue how to make anything. Even after Panera acquired you, they couldn't impart any wisdom into you? And coming from Panera, that would be little wisdom since they have a terrible menu, which you made worse.  It was good to taste the same bitter mud, er, coffee, that Panera serves.  Paradise, you owe me more money for this disgusting crap you served me, but why can't you try to improve? You clearly can't think this food is good? You remind me of the fat girl in school who boys would tell her, she had a cute face just to get some action out of her. Someone once lied to you and told you, you had a cute face and you believed them. The fat girl was fat and being used, and you don't have a cute face."}
{"text":"I have been eating a lot of sandwiches lately, I can't help it tho, they are good.   Paradise would rank somewhere in in the lower half of my preferred sammys. I must explain tho....   I eat there quiet frequently, as they are conveniently located in just about every mall, and down the street from anywhere I would be, BUT the convenience and decent food is the only reason I pick PB. Their Wall-nut Chicken Salad sandwich is my fave, tastes good and pretty filling. My mom had the Chinese Chicken Salad the other day and said bland was an over statement for this ordinary blah salad, \"It needs something.\" is how she described it, even after she added cranbarries, salt and papper and more dressing.   I will say tho, I almost want to add a fourth star for their chipper cookies. So yummy! Perfectly moist and the perfect size for a quick sweet bite. Great price too, I think it's like $4 for a dozen or something.   Overall PB is good, fast service and a decent mean, but use it for your second choice or backup plan."}
{"text":"I'm a usual paradise customer. Today I tried this place and it was horrible. The general manager was too busy talking to actually care about customer needs. I asked for extra dressing for my salad and he was to busy to get it himself. Also my salad looked like the lettuce was old, mostly brown. I usually love this restaurant chain, but won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"The workers here are SO friendly. The minute you walk in the door you'll here a \"Hello, welcome to paradise!\"  and if you stay to eat/study/chat you'll probably hear it every few seconds.  I love coming here to study. They have lots of chairs and booths that welcome it and the staff, of course, does not care how long you sit.   Food is decent. There are better bakeries in general but I can say that their cookies and salads are worth trying."}
{"text":"One of my 2nd offices. Never disappointed. Employees happy to help. Incredible food. Free wi-fi :) Free refills. Lots of table choices, Ideal location. It's a winner - go there"}
{"text":"The ordering setup for this place is extremely awkward. The glass cases virtually make it impossible to communicate effectively with the person taking your order. That may be why my order got messed up yet again. Then after you have given your order, there is very little room to wait for your order without getting mixed up in the line that has yet to give their order. Online ordering would greatly improve order accuracy."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, salads, soups and of course the cookies. Great service for quick lunch. Love the chicken salad on dark molasses bread, a real winner."}
{"text":"I think it's odd that this is a coffee shop but they don't have fresh milk, cream or half and half.  The only thing available is the individually packaged ones that don't require refrigeration.    Free wi fi and decent pastries, muffins and cookies."}
{"text":"I used to love paradise bakery and frequently got my lunch there. Once they were bought by Panera in 2009, the restaurant started to tank.  I stopped in for a salad today and asked for half spring mix and half spinach. I ended up with half romaine and half spinach- needless to say I hate romaine lettuce. I got home before I noticed and to top it off- they gave me maybe a tbsp of dressing for 2 cups worth of lettuce. So here I am, eating a dry salad full of romaine lettuce.   I hate you Panera, you've killed the dreams of paradise bakery lovers in Arizona."}
{"text":"Another pleasant surprise on my trip to AZ. I was trying to find a place for lunch and I had some time to kill before catching my plane- so I ended up in a shopping center...I expected Panera (which I really like) but this was so much better! Great selection of sandwiches/soups/salads and friendly service. I wish they'd open up in Chicago!"}
{"text":"I've been to a Paradise Bakery before that was great but this one is terrible. It was 30 minutes before closing, so we were the only customers at the time. The person making sandwiches was carrying on a conversation so he didn't want to be bothered with us. The sandwich he made me literally had one slice of turkey on it. I asked for a salad and he said to go to the next person, so I did. This person was clearly not capable of making salads since she made me wait for another person to come back to make my half salad. For each person we had to repeat what we wanted multiple times. I was so frustrated that they had over complicated making sandwiches and a salad when there were no other customers. After we got our food, another couple came in and the same girl who wouldn't make my salad made their salads no problem. We will never go back."}
{"text":"I love to come to this restaurant every time I am in rush for lunch. As usual the service crew is giving their out most courtesy which is an A-. I should say it doesn't diminish. Love a roast beef sandwich and their cranberry turkey sandwich. The cookie? hmmm...irresistible. It's a beautiful DAY :)"}
{"text":"the service is terrible every one looks so unhappy and i felt like i was annoying them by being there. im a vegetarian so i orderd the chicken cobb with no meat. I drove 30 mins home then noticed they put bacon on it. i went back the next day and got a free salad from the grumpy manager with NO APOLOGIE. the salad was not fresh and i found the stump of the lettuce in it. Their food is over priced as well. I will not be returning and i wouldnt recomend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Had a line of 7 people yesterday (I was one of them), and they ignored us for quite some time. One guy finally blew and made a scene. Today standing there  by myself. Nobody acknowledged me today, so I am not impressed."}
{"text":"Looks like this Paradise bakery was bought out by Panera, and it's going downhill. Horribly slow food service, a change in menu that is resulting is less value, many menu items have disappeared, and the staff looks less than enthused to be helping. The cashier was busy talking to her friend instead of helping and they served bad and rotten avocado in my husbands sandwich. Hopefully Panera will come save this place. The manager refunded our meal after we complained about the rotten avocado... avoid for now until Panera fully takes over."}
{"text":"A great chain restaurant option  Simple dining proposition with no surprises: Good pastries, soup and sandwich combo, reasonable pricing, free wifi, and quick-casual service that is consistent.  Staff is friendly and they keep the place clean.  Very much like a Panera.  The cinnamon rolls are very soft and uber yum.  Have some good soups, too.  Kids menu and selection of sweet-sweet carbs works for the younglings."}
{"text":"I have not tried anything else except the Chicken Walnut Salad Sandwich (and side), which to me is worth the price.  Cookie that comes with it is really good too!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Paradise for a while now.  I decided to telecommute from there today and I have to say I am not happy.  Lets get the food out of the way.  The food is and has always been amazing.  There is not one thing I can bad about this place when it comes to their food.  Today i found a seat near a power outlet and fired up my laptop.  I found out that they have free wifi that is filtered.  They will block any site they deem not family friendly.  Ok so I get the reason why but come on..  The item that pushed me over the edge today was when an employee decided to open the blinds on all the windows.  The area was a nicely shaded and was not too bright and not too dark.  When she opened the blinds, blinding light hit my eyes and as I struggled to adjust to the brightness the employee walked by and scowled at me for making a funny face...I couldnt see give me a break.  Sorry for the rant there, in other words I recommend getting the food to go."}
{"text":"WOW! So I always order a breakfast sandwich even when it's not breakfast, I just order it with chicken instead of egg and they're always accommodating in making it for me. Even though I always throw them for a loop with my order haha. Seriously it's so good though they need to add it to the menu.   Also, their customer service is fantastic! I had ordered my special sandwich just yesterday and one for my sister and took it home with me after work so we could eat before we had to leave for an evening conference. Well, when I got home and opened the box it was no where near the sandwich I had ordered - no spinach, no tomatoes and it had ham on it for some reason. We don't eat red meat so I was pretty upset and disappointed. We thought we were left with just pasta salad to eat for dinner. I was so tired I didn't even want to deal with it, but my sister said she would call for me. So she did, and explained what happened and let me tell you, not only did they fix our order and make us new sandwiches, but they delivered them to my house!!! (I'm just down the street lol) We were seriously dumbfounded at the fact that they just offered to do this! We told them that it was okay and that they could just issue me a credit or something, but they insisted on \"making it right.\" Jerry, I believe is who brought us our corrected order and we were so grateful. So amazing, they went ABOVE and beyond!"}
{"text":"Hmmm. The layout of this Paradise is weird. I imagine because it's a \"mall\" version, but it leaves a little to be desired.  I for one very much dislike ordering over the tall glass display counter, I'm short so I have to yell over it, which is annoying. You can't self service your drinks, also annoying, especially when you just want water and have to wait. We decided to sit outside and actually questioned how we would know if our order was ready because they didn't give us numbers, but we figured that one out shortly after when each of our names were called over the loud speaker. Meaning they were also calling out other orders the entire time we were there, so when you're trying to have a conversation in between you're getting: SARAH ..... JOHN ..... MAX .... also annoying. Oy vey! lol.  The food was good, but they need some revamps here."}
{"text":"No more...terrible service Arrived on a Sunday, 1pm..ordered food and sat down  It didn't appear that crowded but the staff seemed overwhelmed   Waited 22 minutes for food, asked for it too go, we were in a rush so we didn't check the bag.  We ordered 1 sandwich, 1 soup and 1 half  sandwich half salad.  We get back to the office and check the bag...1 sandwich...1 salad.  They left out the soup and half sandwich as well as the cookies.  So we paid 24.00 for a sandwich and half salad. They sure didn't forget to charge us, they just seem to be unable to deliver what the charge you for  NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO BACK"}
{"text":"Disappointed, ran out of food I wanted to order, but free cookie!  I wanted to order a flat bread sandwich and the cashier said they ran out. Instead, I ordered a Chipotle chicken panini and fire roasted tomato soup. When they called my name I was eager to eat but instead the lady at the counter told me they ran out of the focaccia bread that is intended for the panini. She told me options for bread were sourdough and another one (I can't remember). The \"panini\" and soup were a good pair, and I was surprised they gave me a cookie for desert. That topped it off!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches here!  I had the chicken walnut sandwich and really enjoyed it.  You can tell that they use fresh ingredients and everything is hand made.  The chicken salad was very flavorful, super cold and served on rye bread.  The little chucks on walnut make a huge difference.  With every sandwich purchase you get one of the \"famous\" cookies.  It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Food is good but customer service sucks when they're not busy. Was behind a large salad order and 7 other employees stood around watching the guy making salads and seriously not one helped him. Waited 10 minutes with no other customers around to get helped.  Several employees looked at me but not one acknowledged me.  Watched them stack bowls, talk about their weekend plans, and stare at the cookie machine like they were waiting for it to do something unique.  I just saw some other reviews below about the poor customer service and I'm guessing no one from management who cares is reading the reviews because the same complaints are being posted over and over and no one appears to care."}
{"text":"The sign still says Paradise bakery. But it is in fact converted to Panera. The menu is not as good. I had the southwest chicken Caesar and tomato soup. Barely any chicken, way too much cheese, dressing flavor was off. Maybe the dressing is just me? Tomato soup had too much garlic. Tasted like I could have poured it over spaghetti and it would've been delicious though. So if a bowl of spaghetti sauce is what you were after. Go for it. I wanted tomato soup. And they got rid of their delicious dinner rolls. They now give you a piece of a baguette. It is not as good. And it is tough to eat.  Also ordered cookies while I was there. Got home and realized that recipe has changed too. They are not nearly as good. Overall disappointed with all of the changes. It is a shame to see Paradise bakery go away after all these years. It will be missed."}
{"text":"It reminds me of Panera back home - as a matter of fact, there are undoubtedly ties - but their lack of Equal sweetener is a perplexing omission.    More annoyingly, the employees at this particular location are absolutely cloying - circulating the room like hawks to clear away whatever plate or speck of dust they can find - often to the point of distraction.  A good soundtrack - Neil Young?  Really?? - but the random internet downtimes and 30 minute restrictions simply make Wildflower a far better choice for my needs."}
{"text":"I love this nice quiet location to sit and chat with a friend while having a bite to eat.  However, my walnut chicken salad sandwich was disappointing.  The chicken salad was salty and so heavy with the mayo that it dripped all over the place.  I may go back, though, to try their salads."}
{"text":"I love paradise bakery there salad & sandwiches are really good & fresh. If you like ice tea paradise bakery is the place to get ice tea. There prices are high though."}
{"text":"A nice alternative to Panera in my area, I really enjoyed to quick service and good little salad and sandwich here. The cookie they give you with combos is what pushes it from 3 to 4 stars!  : )"}
{"text":"Best effing oatmeal raisin cookie I've had in my entire life. Even if everything else on the menu sucked, this cookie alone would warrant the 5 stars. Fortunately everything else doesn't suck. Try it and see for yourself.  My other favorite is the turkey cranberry sandwich."}
{"text":"PB is a great all round any time any occasion place. I've been probably over 100 times throughout the valley over the years.  Clean, fresh and consistent.  If you are new go for the pick 2 ($10 on average).  Get a half Sandwhich (note sandwiches get you a free cookie) and 1/2 salad.  The half salad is nearly a meal in Itself if you choose one with chicken.  The pick 2 you can combo up on 1/2 sandwhich, bowl of soup w/ dinner roll, 1/2 salad, bowl of pasta, they have Flatbread options too.   They continue to add new selections to a solid lineup.  Great cookies!!! Get a loyalty card if you like it.  They keep it clean and it's quick even during busy times.  This location is nice.  Free WiFi."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my family and some friends from out of town and it was kind of busy but easy to find a table. The line went fast which is awesome, and I didn't have to talk loud for the cashier guy taking my order to be able to hear me. Cookies here were amazing as usual. I got the Corn Chowder and it was so so good! Could have been a bit bigger for the price though. I think the prices went up a little bit which is a bummer but worth it since the food is so good. I tried the Chai Tea here since i'm obsessed with Chai and surprisingly it was not that good. It tasted very peppery which was not that appealing to me but I drank almost all of it just because it was a little bit pricey. Employees were nice and didn't have to wait long for our orders."}
{"text":"Cookies are great as usual but the kids working there aren't friendly at all. They were too busy chatting with one another behind the counter while the place was filthy and quite a few tables were dirty."}
{"text":"I've never been unhappy with my service or food! Love the fuji apple chicken salad and the cookies, pastries, and coffee, yum-oh!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, the service was good, and the space was clean. I was in Scottsdale for an event and my colleague took me here because it's one of her favorites!  I had the Cranberry Turkey Sandwich and a small Chopped Thai Chicken Salad. Both were very good. I'd have them again and it might be hard to try something different because I enjoyed this selection so much.  Breads are baked fresh and you get a cookie with your meal! No complaints."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery - the name describes it perfectly.  Paradise Bakery opened about the same year I moved to PHX, many moons ago.  They have numerous locations in the PHX area.  Over the years, I've eaten there more than a hundred times and the food is consistently great.  It's not fancy, in fact, you stand in line with a tray (think grade school cafeteria line) and as you move along you can order freshly made to order sandwiches and salads.  They mix your salad ingredients together and toss it right in front of you.  In the short time it takes to create your salad, your sandwich will be ready.  Although they have many sandwich choices, my favorite, is their chicken walnut salad served on dark whole grain bread.  My favorite salad is the crumbly blue cheese with dried cranberries and sunflower seeds, so refreshing and tangy.    Each sandwich or salad comes with one chocolate chip cookie.  If you'd prefer different cookie flavor, just ask.  Paradise Bakery also sells dozen cookie combo packs that make a special treat for a friend, or even better, for you."}
{"text":"Love, love,  this place. I'm here at least once a week or more:)  Great sandwiches, fun place...great cookies, nice folks that work here.  Just don't be in a hurry a lunch time....it gets really busy here between 11am and 1pm."}
{"text":"I am the manager of a Nail Salon across the street from this location. I always come here for lunch and I order the southwest chicken Caesar salad, French onion soup, chocolate chip bagel, and chai tea"}
{"text":"The French toast bagel is delicious! Even when I was trying to avoid ordering a pastry or cookie, I decided on this gem instead. It satisfied my sweet tooth! I like to sit here and get some work done after a snack. I did bring my boyfriend a steak panini and he didn't like it. Not sure what he disliked about it, but at least it came with a cookie!"}
{"text":"Came here to grab dinner before my flight because the world knows how expensive a bag of chips is on Allegiant Airlines ($6!). As soon as I approach the counter, the cashier leaves. When she comes back no smile, no greeting, totally unhappy to be working kind of attitude. I order my food. The staff here is a little unprofessional and immature. A potential customer asked if there was a sit-down restaurant and one of the employees answered that there was possibly at the end of the Gate. The potential customer says Thanks, I'm going to look and may come back. The employee then corrects his previous statement saying that the other place was not sit-down, but order at the counter and then says, \"I wasn't sure what you were asking\". I think you should know what kind of place you work in whether it's drive-thru, sit-down, order at the counter, etc. if you work in a restaurant. The cashier calls my number apparently several times, I thought she would be bringing it to me because I have never been to this kind of place and she didn't say she'd call my number or what my number was and for $9 for my meal, I'd expect slightly better service than a fast food place. She calls my number again and I finally look up and she looks at me like \"Finally, come get your food\". When I come up to the counter she is talking to another customer and a bunch of orders are on the trays next to the register. I go to grab the tray and she gives me my sandwich and soup (no cookie). I then get back in line to ask for some water and hear that employee asking his co-worker, \"I can't believe that guy asked me if there is a better restaurant than ours? What am I going to say yes?\" He didn't ask for a better restaurant he asked for a sit-down restaurant. If he can imagine travelers just want to take a break and get some quality service then he'd understand why this potential customer asked this question. The potential customer did not come back. A few minutes later they call the same number for someone else's order, several times again because they do not yell out loud enough! My garden vegetable with pesto also did not contain any pesto. On the plus side, they did give me ice with my free water and the half panin was a good portion."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location because we have a group that meets here once a month. I am not really a fan of their food. I much prefer Wildflower's choices, And the attitude of people behind the counter has always been like- I'm doing you a favor by making this sandwich or salad or whatever."}
{"text":"Sadly Paradise Bakery is making the transition to Panera Bread.  They claim that they will still have the cookies and muffins we are used to with Paradise, but I wonder.  I hope it is true.  The place looks like a hot mess, and the service was off.  I asked for a lunch menu, and no one could see to find a paper menu.  It just looks pretty sad in there."}
{"text":"I only wanted to buy some cookies. I went in and waited for about 10 minutes then I was asked what could be gotten for me, I said I was going to need a few cookies. The rude man talking to me said \"you mean you would like some cookies.\" I was shocked. All I wanted was to order and leave but I waited patiently asked for what I wanted and this perfect example of bad customer service decides I need an English lesson?? AND I wasn't even asked about my rewards when I watched him ask the two women in front of me if they did. I should have listened to the reviews. This place is AWFUL. Go to a different location and please actually enjoy your visit elsewhere. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Since switching to Panera, this whole place has gone down hill. But, Emily is the sweetest thing and is the only reason I'd give this location anything higher than 1 star. If I was just rating her customer service it would be a 5. All other employees don't bother to try to show any interest in you."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery is a good place to grab some lunch. It's not my favorite place but it surely gets the job done. Their new flatbreads are pretty tasty, I tried the BBQ chicken flatbread today and enjoyed it. The one thing I do absolutely love from Paradise Bakery is their cookies. All of them are soft and delicious!"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. It's conveniently located and has sufficient help during the busy times so I can get in and out quickly when I'm on the go. So for the food has been great. I've always been greated with a smile and occasionally some of the staff remember me because I'm a regular there. The only draw back I have is that when the younger crowd is working the music can be a little loud and not exactly to my liking. I have in the past asked them to change the music and they did. All in all I take out of town guests here for soup and a sandwich."}
{"text":"Great service, good atmosphere, free wifi, and employees who seek to better the customer's experience.  Also, Hannah gave us free drinks. Boom. Thanks Hannah."}
{"text":"This was my first and most likely last visit to at least this location.  Our party of eight people including for adults and four kids between ages 4 and 11.  It took some time five minutes or so to order but it wasn't a big deal because there wasn't anyone else in line.  I ordered a whole Chipotle Chicken Panini sandwich. They said it came with a cookie.  I asked to substitute a bag of chips but the person taking the order said that it can't be done.  After our party placed our order we went to sit down.  There was only two other parties there so we practically had the place to ourselves.    They brought our food or to us in a reasonable amount of time BUT they messed up on five of the eight orders.  It wasn't as if they were swamped with business since our order was the only one they were working on after we ordered.  Our table ordered a couple of salads with chicken- there was NO chicken in either salad.  We also ordered a couple of kids meals with soup-they got both of the soups wrong and didn't include one of the kids meal stuff the yogurt or the cookie.  I ordered the chipotle chicken Panini-there was only six thin pieces of chicken in the sandwich-I was only able to taste bread and no chicken.  Paying $8 for a sandwich with very little  meat is a ripoff."}
{"text":"Collier Center  The best way to get in and out of this place is to call your order in and pick it up.  If you don't work in the Collier Center or anywhere near, parking can be a real pain.    The sandwiches are always good, the cookies are always tasty.  The staff can be a bit iffy but it's obvious that the place gets slammed at lunch time and it's a bit of chaos.  It's only opened M-F 6:30a-4p"}
{"text":"First timer!! Went here with my sis & friend. Sandwiches were good soup was great and the cookie was moist n melted in my mouth. I would definitely do another girls lunch here."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Paradise Bakery and all I can say is YUM! It was so good, I went back for lunch the next day. The dining room is very pleasant and clean, the service is great and the sandwiches are super yummy. I love having this fairly close to our house!"}
{"text":"After a couple hours of shopping, paradise was the perfect spot to stop and get a bite.   I got the 1/2 turkey BLT sandwich and 1/2 Fuji Apple chicken salad. They were both delicious and filled me up!   My girlfriend always orders the Fuji Apple chicken salad and loved every bite of hers. We also love that they give you a free chocolate chip cookie with your meal!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this Paradise often when we lived in Chandler, especially before the \"new\" one went up on Germann/Gilbert.  But now -- I'm resorted to only visiting 2x a year when I go for my dentist appts near by. :)   Yes, that's right -- I love Paradise's sandwiches and sweets so much, that even after a dentist visit I'm still picking up some sugar.   The staff has always been friendly here. And this location has a nice, comfortable feel to it. There even are a few leather sink-in lounge chairs  - - so it's perfect for surfing the internet w/ one of their cookies and some coffee."}
{"text":"Never eating here again. First, there was plastic left in my salad. The manager gave us a credit for a free salad on our next visit. Then, today I get chicken and rice soup with a spoonful of slimy texture about a half of the way through which made me wonder if someone had spit in the food. And toward the end of the bowl, I found a fly in my soup that blended with the rice. I only noticed it because of the wings... disgusting. After taking the bowl back to the front, the manager was sent out and he asked whether there was something he could help me with. I sent back my salad because my appetite is now gone. Apparently he had not even been told what happened. Once we told him what happened and asked for a refund, he gladly took care of it. So, points for customer service. None for the food."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time. It is a great place to meet, hang out, see friends and always have a cookie!"}
{"text":"Love to eat here, but the prices are getting a little too rich for my blood. Not sure how a sandwich and soup cost $16...? I had the Italian this time, I wasn't a huge fan. I wouldn't order it again. You can't go wrong with the Brocc and Cheese soup, that's a staple of Paradise/Panera. I was still hungry afterwords and spend quite a bit of money for a casual lunch, that would probably stop me from coming in again."}
{"text":"Eh, I didn't like my food here.  I ordered the asiago roast beef. So it says Asiago right? But there wasn't asiago on my sandwich, it was American cheese. Is this a mistake or is this what the sandwich is suppose to have? Anyways - besides the cheese, the bread is a little hard and there's not much flavor to the sandwich. It's not that great....  At least it comes with a free cookie, that was good.  Service was slower than I expected - maybe because I thought it'll be super fast food but it's not super slow either.   I am not coming back. I don't like the sandwiches."}
{"text":"The food is great but there is a guy behind the salad counter that moves slower than molasses! He was very unfriendly and took his sweet time making food for people. I could have pumped out more orders behind the counter in 5 minutes than He did in 20 minutes. But back to the food...very inventive menu and nice atmosphere. Much better than Panera Bread!"}
{"text":"Wow this place has crazy prices for a sandwich come on get real I don't understand what justifies paying so much for a soup or a sandwich and the portions are extremely small do yourself a favor and pass unless you have money to blow"}
{"text":"What more can I say!? This place is fantastic for a chain. They are very friendly and the have a great business model! The food leaves something to be desired, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. They are a bakery after all!"}
{"text":"Oh wow! The employee here was very snippy today. I asked if they still took paradise bakery rewards card since I haven't been here in a while. She replied \"we don't take that anymore\" but it's how she said it as if I was inconveniencing her. My friend next to me gave me the look and whispered \"what's wrong with her\". She couldn't keep my order straight either. I had to repeat it multiple times.  I can see why other reviewers keep mentioning rude teenagers working here.  Our salads were good though. However, they don't give a cookie with your meal anymore, so we had to purchase them. The olives in my salad was off tasting but everything else was ok. Hope they do something about the staff though."}
{"text":"I decided to stop by for a late lunch there (inside Scottsdale Fashion Square @ food court) last week after having had a big busy day within the areas of Arcadia and Scottsdale, and I had to boost my energy before returning a long way home.  I ordered: chicken soup w/ turkey rye sandwich combo that came with (freshly-baked) chocolate chip cookie, bread roll, Panera-brand orange juice (plastic bottle), and their limit-edition tulip cookies (pink & yellow icing) to take home.  The young gal taking my order was courteous- she even glanced over at me taking my first bite to see if I liked it.  I like that they wore gloves to prep the food.  I dined in.  The soup was nicely hot and the sandwich was nicely prepared- the portions were classic lunch size.  The chocolate chip cookie was medium-sized and chewy; the tulip cookies were shortbread soft and tasty (the royal icing was not so sweet and just right)- so soft that you'd have to sit and eat them because they crumbled easily.  Tab was $16 (tax incl). You get what you paid for.  It was a treat for me at the moment because I am more of a home cooker/baker and eating out was an exception (locally), especially after a busy day.  Thanks, Paradise Bakery & Cafe ;) I may be back in the future next time I visit this mall..."}
{"text":"I love eating here, I just wish it was a little bit cheaper.    I always get the same things: Half Sandwich and Half Soup Deal (PICK 2) and comes with a chocolate chip cookie (perfect amount of food for me) Sandwich Favorites:  Chicken Walnut, Tuna Salad Soup Favorites: Brocolli Cheddar, Fire Roasted Tomato (ask for a roll and dip it in the soups)  I have personally sampled all the soups, and did not like them as much as I like the above ones.  All their pastries, in general, are very delicious.  I especially like getting their chipper cookies because I like to have little bites of all types of cookies when I eat my dessert."}
{"text":"Running errands on a Sunday afternoon, decided to stop in for a healthy salad. The menu they have hanging in plain sight only gives the names of the menu items, but doesn't give any details as to what ingredients are in these salads/sandwiches. At a place like this, where I believe they thrive on the fact their menu is diverse and there are a lot of great ingredients in these yummy menu items, not being able to read about the items is somewhat frustrating. I wanted the \"Mediterranean Quinoa\" salad but wasn't sure what ELSE it had in it besides quinoa. When I asked the guy who took orders he said he didn't know because he's \"never worked in the salad department before\". So finally I asked for a paper menu which described the salad.  The salad was OK, very skimpy on the quinoa which is why I got it in the first place. The coffee is very good.  The place is nice and big, very spacious, and would be a great place to meet friends, sit a while, linger over coffee and a book or do homework or work. Not the cleanest in regards to the fact there is some trash on the ground/floors need to be swept. I'll come back here because I like the atmosphere and for the most part like their food, I just would like to see a more visible full menu and a little better customer service"}
{"text":"If you have experienced the cookies at Paradise Bakery you're probably hooked.  While you can find several locations throughout the valley, the one on Germann and Gilbert is by far the best.  What sets this location apart from the rest is the staff.  It is apparent that they love their work, and they greet you with a sincere smile.  In this day and age it is rare to find employees that consistently offer superior service, and make you feel that they are truly honored and grateful that you choose their restaurant.    As for the location itself it is well kept and clean, and the food is fresh and always top notch.    So the next time you have that rumble in your tummy, treat yourself to Paradise Bakery.  And don't forget to take home a few cookies...the one that you get with your meal will have you craving for more when it's gone."}
{"text":"Hit this Paradise for lunch with a friend- it is conveniently located for both of us. I don't  go to Paradise often, but when I do I order the same thing, half a club and salad. I had heard the mac and cheese was super delish so I gave it a try.   I have never had a bad experience with the food (again I order the same thing every time so take that into consideration).  The mac and cheese was pretty tasty and the bread and meat are always fresh.   The lack of a full five stars is due solely to the fact that every time I am in a Paradise I seem to become stupid all the sudden- lol.  I never know where to go to order or who is giving me what and then pay who and which line?  Not a big deal but seems to change each time.  I think they are trying to figure out the best plan for dealing with the big lunch crowd :/   Not a deal breaker and almost more comical on my end.  Our food did arrive at the table- took a bit longer than I expected- but tasted great!  If we could do half stars I would say 4 1/2"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I love the club sandwich. My husband and I go here for the food and the atmosphere. It is quite homey, I dont like coffee but this would be a perfect place to read the paper and sip a cup of Joe. The cookies are the best if they are cooked right. I find that they do not cook them all the way sometimes. Most of the time I have to get something other than the chocolate chip just because I do not like eating dough."}
{"text":"Great place for sandwiches and soup.   Would say more of a lunch place with salads, soup, panini, flatbread,  pasta, pastries and of course awesome cookies.  I ordered the steak and white cheddar panini and french onion soup. Both were good and tasty. The amount of meat was thin and the soup was luke warm. They did not have any more panini bread so they asked about caibatta bread, so when my wife order her caibatta they ran out of caibatta bread.  Remember you always get a cookie with your meal.  The best part of the restaurant are the cookies and chippers.   If you leave without having a cookie, you should put a bag over your head. The chippers are just smaller cookies so try a variety of different kinds."}
{"text":"they have pretty good cookies, i know there are allot better options in my neighborhood for some cookies. but if i'm downtown in the mix and they are open, i might grab a snickerdoodle or a Chocolate Macadamia"}
