{"text":"Thought the food was awesome for a quick bite to eat when running errands through the mall. Would suggest the sesame chicken!"}
{"text":"My family came in to visit from New Mexico. We ordered a 2 entree, and while the food tasted great.. we asked for a water cup. When we asked for more water for a 4 oz cup they said they \"don't do refills on water\" because \"his boss said\". I have never been denied water anywhere. That is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Just go to Panda Express. The quality and portions here are not great. The BBQ pork looks better than it tastes."}
{"text":"Ordered the beef noodle soup with a teriyaki chicken as a side. Honestly, the taste is not bad, but it would be better if they can add more beef to it. There are only 6 - 7 tiny pieces and that is definitely not enough. The chicken is not as tender as you can get from a restaurant due to the fact that these are pre-made, but the teriyaki sauce kinda soften it a bit, so I think that is acceptable. By the way, this is not a purely Japanese food, it is more like fusioned Asian."}
{"text":"Maybe a little hole-in-the-wall-ish for the Fashion Show Mall... but the food isn't too bad. Be wary, although this is \"food court food,\" Las Vegas strip pricing bumps up the dollars a little bit more. They have a la carte pricing and also two-entree plates which are the better deal, IMHO. The plates come with your choice between a side of rice, noodles or half/half. Sadly, they didn't have labels on what the food was, so I had to half guess and mostly point. Nonetheless, it wasn't too bad. Here's the breakdown:  I got the two-entree plate with noodles as my side and this chicken, mushroom, zucchini medley which had peanuts and orange chicken as my entrees. MIL got the same two-entree plate with half/half noodles & fried rice & teriyaki chicken & a Mongolian style beef (?) as her entrees.  Both agreed that the NOODLES were absolutely delicious! They honestly don't look like anything special & the veggies were huge chunks, but the flavor was so good! I also enjoyed the orange chicken & the teriyaki chicken was yummy per my mom. Have the say, though, that the noodles make the review..  Don't knock it 'til you try it! I just wish they would put labels on the food so you don't have to guess. And the sizes for their ala carte items are a little small for the prices they charge, but again it's the Strip pricing."}
{"text":"Food was old and dry. Garbage.  Food may have been prepared days earlier. They definitely need to do something about the quality of food here"}
{"text":"This will be short and sweet. These folks will dish you out some Japanese food in a hurry... and for cheap.  Even my vegetarian friend found something to eat."}
{"text":"I looked forward to a tasty Japanese noodle. Not!  They started by having me wait 10 minutes for a quick noodle soup. (She forgot about order) I had to chase her down, where is my noodle soup?  The soup had no resemblance to the soup in the picture. Chewy noodles with Tiny pieces of meat. Did not finish both orders, kinda bad.  The mango grapefruit tapioca dessert was a drink thru a straw not to be eaten with a spoon. Just a so so drink with many options around us.  Don't think I will be coming Back here again."}
{"text":"For a restaurant that prides itself on being fresh the meat was surprisingly cold. If you were to taste the noodles in a blind taste test you would probably assume they were skinner pasta with cabbage mixed in. By and large everything was exceptionally under-seasoned."}
{"text":"Tried their chicken and shrimp lunch special. Typical chinese fast food, nothing special. But the food tasted good and it was worth the buck."}
{"text":"Quick bite to eat. The price was great! And it was fast too. I paid only $8 for two entree meal with rice. The mushroom chicken was great, the pepper steak is another story, pretty much inedible. Should have ordered two chicken entrees. I sampled teriyaki chicken and that tasted great."}
{"text":"The picture of food on the menu does not correspond with the actual meals. After l finish my order, the staff told me the order had been sold out. This is a Japanese restaurant. However, the flavor is much close to Chinese food. Under such a price level, Definitely, you have any better choice in this shopping mall."}
{"text":"I know,  I know. Food Court food. But don't stick your nose up at this place. The Chicken Udon is quite tasty. Some vegetables would have been great, but Udon for under $6 is not a bad deal. There's a beef soup as well. The main dishes didn't appear as authentic."}
{"text":"This place is located in the food court. They had noodle soup, so I bought one.  It was served in a plastic bowl, so it turned my friend off from eating it due to her allergy, but I felt it was fine since I had no reaction to it. It tasted good as far as the food was concerned, and the price was decent. Not sure about the quantity, though."}
{"text":"service was quick and easy. employees were super nice! had the teriyaki chicken with fried rice which was so so delicious"}
{"text":"Friend and I discovered Suki Hana over a year ago and I have been addicted to their pepper chicken ever since!!! I have tried to recreate it at home and just never comes out the same. I have tried their other items, but it's the pepper chicken that I want.  Its chicken, onions, jalapenos cooked in perfect harmony! It's a great place for a fast quick lunch down at Az Mills Mall. Yea I'll be back lol."}
{"text":"The customer service was excellent. There were two people working behind  the counter. One took the order anf one range up the items. Food: The chow mein noodles are spaghetti. Gross! However the beef noodle soup was good. Not the udon noodles only the broth and beef."}
{"text":"Employees were rude. Noodles were spaghetti noodles with no sauce, chicken was okay but nothing special. The guy told me larges come with 1 free refill but when I went back to refill he said no it's $1.00! What a joke :("}
{"text":"This is a fairly new offering inside Northlake mall food court.  I don't know why it took so long but I'm glad I stood on the line to try the food.  The offerings include typical hot plate fare like Bourbon chicken, Pepper chicken, etc.  You can do 1 or more entrees with a side (rice or lo mein) and a vegetable (a sauteed cabbage mix or carrots) . If you want teriyaki dishes, this is prepared fresh to order and you can add onions and extra spicy if you like spicy.  I tried shrimp and steak teriyaki which was pretty good, fresh, hot and a healthy size portion for less than $9.50.  I plan to be back, I like this option than some of the other \"fast food\" options there."}
{"text":"I do not appreciate stingy service nor do I tolerate it but because we were hungry we settled. The orange chicken actually isn't bad but I did not know that until I tried it. Here's where it started. I asked the little, old, asian lady if i could sample the pork and the orange chicken so I could decide. She said \"only one\"... (wtf? How will i know want I want if I've never tried your food?)  Me: \"why's that? I would like to try them both\"  Her: -sassy \"only one.\"  Me: \"I want to try the pork\"  She gives it to me but doesn't shake the grease off and it got on my shirt and jeans.... then I asked to try the orange chicken... She swayed her head with irritation and hesitated to give it to me making me reach way over the counter to accept the sample from her....  So I told her what we wanted. Although I should have just gone else where. And then at the end she gave the two of us 1 fucking napkin, spoon and fork.  1 for 2 people!!  Boyfriend : \"ummm can I have some more napkins and forks\"  Her: -rolls eyes, hesitates and sighs\" and gives him some more napkins.   I don't understand what the hell her deal is or why she is so stingy but that was really rude and upset me. 1 fucking napkin???? 1 fucking sample!?? Smh.  Do you want a sale or not?  As for the food, it's actually not bad. More real tasting than panda."}
{"text":"Great portion for lunch. Sesame chicken is great! I am so love the tomato salad!"}
{"text":"Trapped in Arizona Mills during a drawn-out shopping experience, I had no choice but to make a beeline to the Food Court for some long-overdue sustenance. I chose Suki Hana because I wanted something with seafood in it, and they offer shrimp stir-fry along with other entrees.  I was mistakenly under the impression that since this was Japanese cuisine, it was less likely to be greasy than Chinese fast food. Not only is the food a bit on the oily side, but the chicken stir-fry dish contains chicken meat that should've been trimmed better of the tendons, fat, and connective tissue. I spent some time pulling apart the chicken to remove the largely inedible parts.  It's not the most unappetizing fast-food experience I've had. The food here satisfied my hunger pangs and kept me going so that I could complete the endless march to traverse the Arizona Mills rotunda (honestly... they could've added one central corridor to avoid having to complete the entire circuit every time). However, if you need a change of pace and some greasy chicken with noodles and rice, you've found your Food Court vendor here."}
{"text":"This food was not even edible. The fried rice tastes like it's been sitting for 2 weeks. Bleh. Will never waste $8 on this stuff ever again."}
{"text":"The sesame chicken looked good. After sitting down to eat I opened my food box and the smell was off. The taste was bad and I could not eat the lunch.   I love Japanese Food and this was the worst I have ever tried. I told the nice lady working and she offered to give me a different meat which I turned down. Never eating their food again."}
{"text":"I am very pleased with the price, quantity and quality of the food, so was my wife, who is too picky on everything. Ordered orange and pepper steak with side of noodles and my wife eat chicken triyski , Kong put chicken with side of fried rice. Awesome, much better than the treasure island buffet last night."}
{"text":"I posted before I realized I had the wrong restaurant name. I don't know if this one is still around, but it's not in the food court."}
