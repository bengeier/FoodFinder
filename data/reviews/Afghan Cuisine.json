{"text":"For Afghan/ME food this place is very decent.  Clean facilities.  Portions are good.  Prices are are acceptable.  This place is better than Joe's Hamburgers."}
{"text":"Food was average. Non-lunch prices are steep for the location and food quality. Only thing that stood out was the slightly more classy decor and seating."}
{"text":"Good eatery! Okay food. Okay price

Only issue is this place is near to the noisy (but the best) Bamiyaan Kabob. If you chance - less people and place to sit - I would still prefer to go to Bamiyaan though :-)"}
{"text":"Went in today with coworkers for lunch since in the past we had a good experience at this restaurant and food is good and affordable. But the service today was REALLY BAD! A coworker of mine ordered a chicken wrap, i know for a fact that she ordered chicken since she was young she never ate BEEF because of her religion so there is no way in hell that she will ever order BEEF. So she got her wrap and she started eating it. Since its a wrap unless you disassemble it you would not know by the looks of it whether it was red or white meat inside so she took a bite and ate it. Never in her life she tasted beef so she ask us taste it since it tasted weird for her. So we disassembled the wrap at this point and tasted the meat inside it. It was beef!!!!! At that point my coworker talked to the cashier and informed her that instead of giving her chicken, she gave her beef. Instead of apologizing, she raised her voice to my coworker and told her she made a mistake on her order which was not true at all. Unfortunately  we don't have a proof since the receipt just says lunch special. She did not apologized , she did not even offer to give her a replacement. At this point my coworker even though clearly upset but hungry  ordered another chicken wrap despite us telling her not to do it and we can just transfer to another restaurant. I was well tempted to just really make a scene but We don't want to stoop down to her level. The 5 of us and all other people that we know of swear never again to go back to this restaurant!  I understand that the reason that the cashier would have not  admitted her mistake was that it might end up that she foot the bill. But what I don't understand is why she needs to raise her voice to my coworker.   A simple hint of humility could have been ok. If there is 0 stars, i will definitely give this place that. Also the beef tika i ordered this time around was dry. So food quality is not consistent."}
{"text":"Gave Afghan Cuisine a try as Bamiyan Kabob in the same plaza is packed with people.  We ordered the dinner combo and the chicken kabobs had great flavour was nice and tender. The restaurant also has a nicer environment and more spacious than Baniyan."}
{"text":"Great service and the food is delicious .. Try the kebabs and the best is, there isn't a long line up ... People are friendly and the servers are sweet."}
{"text":"Its not anything special, but their prices are decent and service adequate (although lacking if you want server type service since they call your food order number and you have to come back from your seat to pick it up). Its similar to the style of nearby favorite bamiyan kebab (which also boasts afghan cuisine). It has ample parking for everyone and quite a bit of seating even though it was packed when I went but we didn't experience any problems obtaining one on a Saturday night around 9pm.The food was adequately portioned and tasted a-ok!"}
{"text":"First time customer here. The ambiance is modern, there is a lot of money invested in renovation. The food we tried was good. I love Afghan pillow, and mostly came for it, it didn't disappoint. Stuff was patient with us as we didn't really know all the names for the dishes, so we just pointed to what people had and they explained what it was and how it was prepared. Good place to have a quick lunch or to order take out.
The only minus was a salad - mostly shredded romaine lettuce with two bits of greenish tomato and mayo. Would stick to meat and rice next time."}
{"text":"Amazing well-cooked food. We came here since we like Afghan cuisine and we really enjoyed our meal. I order mantu and the rest orderd qubailee rice with chicken and ground beef. Their pudding was tasty too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good service and very clean! The only thing I wasn't impressed was is the food, since the meat isn't cooked properly!"}
{"text":"Loved the foods. I bet it's one of the best places where you'd actually find some halal foods that will fill not only stomach but your heart. I am saving one star for the next time may be."}
{"text":"Food was good but not great. The yogurt drink was so watery. Clean, nice decor, nothing so special about it though."}
{"text":"Had a chicken wrap and the lamb chops here. Both were excellent. Seasoned well. The naan was soft and the wrap held together as most do not. Give it a try, you'll likely be glad you did."}
{"text":"One of my favourite place for a sandwitch. The prices at this place is reasonable and parking is available all times. Clean and tidy place."}
{"text":"Went there today and I really like the food. The sizes of the meals are great. They definitely not cutting corners to save money.. And the prices are fair. 

The place looks like a very expensive restaurant... I like the interior design, the girl I brought here a couple of weeks ago really liked the food and place. She said she was surprised by the quality of the food and the very low prices. 

This is way better than bamiyan restaurant. Definitely worth checking it out."}
{"text":"I like Afghan Cuisine a lot. It is a competitor to Bamiyan Kebab which is close by. I think it is probably just as good. I like to order the Chicken Korma which is, I think, 5.99 and comes with a chewy flatbread they call naan and some salsa-type stuff. The korma swims in a sea of grease and reminds me of Hungarian food."}
{"text":"I've never been let down by Afghani cuisine and this place is no exception. Although, Naan at this place are extraordinary. So 5 stars just for that. 


(Just a suggestion to the management, the space, though well-designed, can be a little cramped. Especially for a family of 5 or more)"}
{"text":"The food tastes amazing here and the prices are decent too compared to bamiyaan kabab. However the service is terrible."}
{"text":"Used to like it at first. Now when I go, the service is terrible. Mostly the mean women at the front. The young girls and cooks are nice. And few months ago I found a hair in my rice. A different time the salad was ice cold, like literally ice in the salad and it was so soggy. Its still okay to go to in emergencies as they are open really late, but it's a last resort"}
{"text":"FatCat try few dishes at this place before and was planning to give 4 stars for food. Yesterday FaCat try lamb shank - yummy!.  Immediately upgrade rating to 5 stars for food.

Fatcat wishing he become sentient earlier in life. FatCat not realize how much good food humans eating in restaurants. 

Things FatCat Like
- food is good
- service is good
- place is clean
- prices are more than fair - especially for quality and quantity of food

Things FatCat not Like
- Location is too close to gangster neighborhood of Flemingdon park.  FatCat risking one of 9 lives every time he want to try lamb shank.. But totally worth it. FatCat is very very versatile cat. FatCat start listening to more rap music to understand gangster mentality so FatCat know how to handle himself in gangster neighborhood. Problem solved.."}
{"text":"Visited recently and enjoyed the food. This is a counter service format restaurant, so you place your order and grab a table and wait for your number to be called. The Chapli kabob and mantu were quite good, without the prices of more formal settings. They also carry some indo-pak dishes, and the chicken korma (boneless) was very tasty. I look forward to returning and trying more dishes."}
{"text":"So the kabab karahi was good with the naan. Lamb shank was mostly good. My kid found it chewwy and not juicy enough. A pleasent place to sit and share food as there was lots of seating most of it empty. Food took abit more then 15 mins to prepare which felt longer then we expected. We didnt try desserts. 2 dishes were big enogh to share w 3 ppl."}
{"text":"Omg!! Service was reaaaally slow. It's a serve-yourself fast food place, but it took them 25 minutes to make a kebab combo! The food was alright but very oily. The salad was just lettuce with a gross amount of Cole slaw dressing that got all over the meat and the rice, and quite frankly made half of the dish inedible. I'm so disappointed. It's been a week of bad food for me :("}
{"text":"This place looks lovely inside. I was looking for rice and salad and some vegetables. I asked if the dinners come with rice and salad, and the person taking my order confirmed. So I ordered the mixed vegetable dinner. When it comes out it's a large container of rice, naan, and a side of curried vegetables. I asked the person who took my order about salad and she said the mixed vegetables doesn't come with salad, only the meat dinners come with salad. She said she could give me more rice. What they had provided was already probably 3 servings of rice. I noted that I specifically asked for salad when I ordered, and therefore was not interested in more rice. She did nothing to make it better which was disappointing. 
The hot sauce they serve is great, like a pickled spicy condiment. The (abundant) rice was tasty, and the curried veg was satisfactory, not something I would return for. I really just wanted some salad. lol 

If the owner reads this I would make the following recommendations: 
- more clarity on the menu to what constitutes a \"dinner\", perhaps more training for employees about customer service 
- tell the girls up front to chat less, and pay attending to making customers happy their priority. There was me and another couple in the restaurant. When their food came up, instead of bringing it to their table they just yelled out the number. If I can tell who's food it is, the people working the counter should go the extra 5 steps and just bring over their food
- when a staff coughs or sneezes into their sleeve, they should still go wash their hands instead of continuing what they're doing 

Overall, I would give this place another try and be VERY clear about what I want and what I'm getting."}
{"text":"Low quality food. I don't know why I came here for the second time. Won't come again."}
{"text":"Fantastic addition to the \"afghan cuisine\" in the area.   Bamiyan kebob is a staple in the area and are very good and consistent at what they do. 

Afghan Cuisine is a healthy competition, their food is also very flavourful and delicious.  

I hope they keep the quality consistent as it is the key to their success. 

They have combo's and family packs for those who want to share and sample different items.  

Fantastic and will visit again!"}
{"text":"This is a brand new restaurant in Ajax. It offers a variety of meal options that are 100% Halal. Their combos are reasonably priced and have a few family deals advertised on their menu. If you have a smaller appetite you can purchase kebabs or sides a la carte. The restaurant itself has a friendly atmosphere with spacious seating.  It is in a strip mall and the parking lot is shared with a Costco and The Keg. Spots can be hard to come by. It is definitely worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Food was ok. The service by the staff was really slow and the cook in the back was yelling constantly"}
{"text":"A spontaneous stop-in after my mom's art show in the area served as my introduction to Afghan cuisine. This unassuming place is in a strip mall but isn't the only afghani kid on the block; the apparently well-known Bamiyan Kabob is in the same complex. I haven't tried this place but Afghan Cuisine was a straightforward and tasty takeaway spot. Apparently they have good deals for lunch.

Highlight:
Combo 1 (Beef tikka and Sheesh kabob). Tasty!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing meat choices and for me that's important,  the rice and salad is great"}
{"text":"I would say this place is a solid 3.5 stars, but I will round up.

I came here yesterday night.   Service is good and portions are good.   You get a lot of rice and a baked naan, some salad (too much sauce though) and a meat.   I had the beef tikka.   I recommend this dish.   Meat was seasoned perfectly and was nice and moist.      Wish there was more though.   1 skewer for 11.99 is fair but the meat to rice ratio is a little off.   

My friend had the pork chops and a mango lasse .   I felt the 4 pieces were a little on the over done side and were quite thin.   Not worth ordering that again.   The mango lasse was tasty but you get a pretty small glass for $2.99.

The place is very clean and staff is friendly.   Would go back to try some of the other items."}
{"text":"Not so long ago, this restaurant would have scored 4+ stars from me.
But lately, there have been serious issues with their customer service and reliability of home delivery.
Also, the flavouring, texture and portion size of their meat dishes e.g. karhai beef seekh and spicy tandoori chicken cubes, have deteriorated noticeably.
Their naan, bolani, vegetable dishes, sauces, and firni are still some of the best around."}
{"text":"I ordered the Sultani Kebab dinner and a mango smoothie. The dinner was very yummy. It was a lot of food. I was not able to finish it all, so I got a take out container for the rest. 

The mango smoothie was very delicious. I absolutely love it! 

The restaurant is set up like a fast food place. So you order, sit down and wait for your number to be called. It's very noisy, so probably not the best place for a date. But enjoyable none the less."}
{"text":"This place still rocks! Lunch special choice of Beef Tikka, Chaplee Kabob, Shish Kabob, Chicken Breast Kabob or Tandoori Chicken with brown basmati rice, salad and pop for $8.99 from 11am to 3pm weekdays. 

Meat was very tender, great flavour. Afghan Naan is not included in the lunch special, but I decided to get it. Made fresh to order, very warm and extremely soft.

Bamiyan across the street burns their naan and serves undercooked kabob, I had a bad experience. Fair warning."}
{"text":"Lunch special is now $10.99. Not a good deal for lunch at all as they see giving only $1.00 off the regular price. The tandoori chicken pieces are so much smaller than Bamiyan's and too much rice. Small basic salad with few pieces of small tomatoes and cucumbers and swimming in dressing. Does not come with a naan. I think next time I'll be going to Bamiyan since its only a dollar difference and their salad alone is to die for."}
{"text":"I work across the street from Afghan Cuisine. There is a daily lunch special for $8.99, includes meat, rice and salad. A noon can be substituted for rice or add for $0.99. 

Place is always clean, staff will be friendly if you are otherwise you can expect dry to the point service.

There are a few different varieties of meat, seasoned and cooked well. 

For $10 it's certainly a bang."}
{"text":"Great cuts of meat for the kabobs and very nice seasoning.  Naan is always fresh.  Dining room is a bit messy since the owner is working out the new location in Richmond Hill.   My pick up order has be messed up twice but was addressed with no fuss, but I have heard this does happen often so double check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"The food is good, however there were many flies in the restaurant and it's very frustrating. Some landed on my naan while I was eating and I've to throw it out. We told the lady at the front about it, and all she said was ok ok."}
{"text":"Excellent Afghani food. The have a number of vegetarian choices - all of them excellent. Their spicy red relish us a good zinger. Make sure to try their dogh (lassi, Afghani style)."}
{"text":"Very large and spacious restaurant with nice decor. Portions were large. Food was decent. Kind of weird that customers eat fast food style (no wait staff) since Afghan Cuisine is not fast food."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I like better than the more popular bamiyan kebob in the same plaza. Big fresh meat pieces, fresh salads and naan. Standard afghan prices"}
{"text":"Good family place to eat. They are friendly and welcoming every time. Also their food is delicious"}
{"text":"Thank God for this restaurant so close to my home...its become a staple for me. I especially like their lamb shank, their beef tikkas, the rice and their naans (flatbread). The meat is cooked perfectly and neither under nor over spiced. The beef karahi was nowhere near as good as everything else they have...in fact...dont order the beef karahi...it misrepresents them. Yes, it does take quite a while to get your order but if you order in advance on the phone, it will save you the hassle of sitting around for 20 minutes and then you'll really appreciate the food. I can't imagine it would taste as good if they made it in much less time."}
{"text":"My first impression was how clean and well kept the restaurant was. The lady working there was helpful in answering our questions about the food. Everything was prepared quickly and came in large portions.

I ordered tandoori chicken and my boyfriend ordered the lamb shank. 10/10 for the lamb shank, it was super juicy and tender. Both dishes came with rice and salad. I liked the flavor of the rice and the hot sauce that came with was good too. Would not get the tandoori chicken next time but would try a different meat!

Definitely very worth it for the money and would go there again!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and inviting. The food quality, quantity and taste is an \"A\" the meat is tender and juicy, the complimentary bread they give you is oven hot and yummy."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic really good taste fresh hot but the service is shit hope they get their happiness on then I will probably give it a five-star"}
{"text":"Ordered take out and portions were extremely small. The containers were half filled and the chicken kebab dinner was so small it must have come from an anorexic chicken. We also ordered the vegetable stew  which was basically half a container full and filled with 1/4 \" of oil... Yuck. The bread was good, but one cannot survive on bread alone. The menu said that the dinners come with rice and salad, but never received any salads....rice was good and flavoured with a lot of cumin. Decor seemed nice and clean and the wait time for take out was minimal. Would I go back? Probably, but only if I was dieting and allowed minimal food."}
{"text":"I love AfG kabab, especially with \"Afghan cuisine \"as I've been many time and I try most of their food test, lamp, chable kabab, soltani kabab ."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've tried Afghan cuisine and I was happily surprised. We ordered the chicken kabob lunch special, $8.99, as an easy introduction to Afghan tastes. Perfectly cooked, juicy and nicely spiced. The rice tastes like it's cooked with cinnamon, but when I asked I was told it's not and that it's a combination of afghan spices. The rice is really good. Salad was lightly dressed and refreshing. The hot sauce was excellent, not too hot and very flavourful. 

This is not a fast food restaurant it seems that all the meats are cooked fresh. So have patience, I think it's worth the wait.

The restaurant is newly renovated, modern and very clean. There is lots of seating available with many booths.

Next time I'm going to be more adventurous order something I've never tried before."}
{"text":"This humble shop a few doors down from Bamiyan Kabob is a quaint restaurant that provides an ideal setting for a small to medium sized gathering (1-10 people).

The interior can be compared to big-name family friendly restaurants. And they have a good number of booths and tables. At 6pm, on a weekday, many tables were available. The menu focuses on their meat offerings; however, they have a good number of vegetarian dishes as well. 

I ordered the chicken kabob combo that includes 6 chunks of mildly spiced meat accompanied by a salad and a bed of rice with a side of naan bread. The chicken was very juicy and tender. The salad is primarily shredded lettuce with a few pieces of tomato, onion, and cucumber. Basic but delicious. The rice isn't the traditional Afghani rice but very aromatic.

I think the biggest accomplishment is that this place converted my ever-skeptical dinner companion. Although he was curious initially about the \"new flavors\" that were testing his palate, by the end of the meal, he was looking at the menu and telling me about what he would order next time. I consider this a significant win.

Service is friendly. You have to go up to a counter to order and pay at the beginning of the meal (as appears to be common with Afghani restaurants) and then they will call your number when it is ready. However, it is served on appropriate dinnerware. They are efficient at cleaning up after customers finish and appear flexible to accommodate customers not familiar with the cuisine.

Price point is higher than Kabul-Tehran but the portions are about equal. I feel I must point out that Afghan cuisine charges an additional $2 for rice. All in all, I would definitely return to this place in the future. Delicious!"}
{"text":"After receiving a massage in the plaza I dropped by for a quick bite. 

First, this isn't a place where you MUST go. If I was not in the area, or next time I am in the area I won't be returning.

Secondly, there is plenty of parking which is always good.

Lastly, the service was good as the ladies behind the counter are kind.

I had the tandoori chicken and my date had the 2 types of chicken. The portions were loaded with rice and salad and a side of meat. Admittedly,  I don't go to many afghan restaurants but I struggled to find the identity as it resembles many falafel places but was missing the tahini sauces and the dips for the bread.

The chicken was the star of the meal, but you would be confused as it seems the rice is trying to take all the glory.

The bill came to about $40 for 2 meals and a yogurt drink. If you like yogurt you would love it."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Both quality and quantity wise excellent. Family environment. I would recommend this place to everyone. I came here with friends and decided to eat at this place, I am glad we had food here. We had different kabob dinners combo 2 and combo 4 were very good. We also tried lamb shank and it was very good."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick chicken kabob pita sandwich to go and it was a ok.  Not sure why the decor is so over the top at this place (think fireplace, dark dining room, crystal balls hanging from the ceiling...etc) since the menu doesn't strike me as a fancy, sit-down kind of joint.  

They have extensive take out menu which I may try out sometime.  The take out menu is not all 
\"Afghan\" and I'm not sure if that would make the quality of their food suffer.  L.A .short with fries from Afghan Cuisine?  I'm not so sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Afghani food I have ever had, and not to mention the worst customer service I have ever experienced. 

This all started when I talked to the order staff regarding my meal as the chicken in my order was very dry. When I told the girl at the front,she retorted \"Well that's too bad\", a little surprised at this I asked her if she can replace it with the Chaplee Kebab (spelling might be wrong there) she said \"How do you expect me to replace it after you ate it?\", once again a little surprised by her response because if there is another way to tell if my chicken is dry without eating it I would like to know! Regardless I had a little battle with this girl and I ended up getting it replaced with one piece of kebab alongside my old rice from my previous dish I complained about. I was sincerely disgusted by the level of service and the total disregard for customer service this restaurant displays. I will recommend you don't visit this restaurant unless you like being treated poorly by restaurant employees. 

I forgot to add they have the audacity to ask for tips even though you have to pick your own food up!"}
{"text":"Living in Mississsauga, Afghani places are in abundance and I have probably been to most of the places here.  So instead of the chain Bamiyan, I decided to check out this lesser reviewed Afghan Cuisine.

It was probably the most forgettable experience that I have had.

The bad?  Trays upon trays with dirty dishes greet you as soon as you walk through the front doors.  Not a great impression.  Clientele was also a bit depressing, people with sullen faces, eating alone.  Whereas at some place like Watan, usually I see large groups dining, and most of the time, they're smiling and laughing.

The good?  The food was decent, good value at $7.99 for a select dishes for lunch that lasts up to 3pm.  Again, food was good, but forgettable.

If I was in the immediate area, I wouldn't mind coming back here, but it certainly wouldn't be my Top 10 choices."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant that recently opened. It's in the same plaza with Costco and next to Bank of Montreal. It offers several meal options that are Halal and pricing is reasonable. We have come here a few times and ordered the chicken kabob wraps. The wraps are well made with chicken breast kabob meat marinated and grilled with salad and garlic sauce. The meat inside is moist and tasty. The staff warmly greet you when you walk in. Hopefully they keep at it so we can continue coming :)"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is always empty, but I've been here a few times and the food isn't that bad.  It's not as great as Bamiyan Kebob, but still a good spot when hungry and in a rush.

Portion sizes are huge and very filling, with the Tandoori kebob being my favourite.

Staff are friendly. 

If you haven't tried this place out, give it a shot next time you're hungry."}
{"text":"Love Afghan cuisine so decided to try this out.
The food tastes great. The server helped me choose options that saved me some $$ based on the substitutes I wanted."}
{"text":"Durham region is quickly changing. The diversity and culture in this region is nice to see. With all that culture comes the food of course. 

On a Friday night, tired of the usual, decided to try this place. I have always had good experiences with other Afghan places , such as Bamiyan Kabob in Scarborough and Maimana Naan down the street. I love afghan food so it should be a win..win.

This place wasn't very business. It was clean and the decor was quite nice. I ordered the Beef & Chicken Kebab dinner. My wife ordered the Beef Seekh Kebab. The girl at the counter told us that one dinner wouldn't be enough for two people. We did want to share, but after hearing her advice we ordered two. Big mistake!!! Or a good mistake depending on how you might look at it.

The portions are huge!! But it was also very tasty, we ordered the dogh drink as well. It's a must have in a place like this.

All in all I can't complain, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Large portions... decent pricing... well cooked meat... 

The salad can use a bit more veg... It was on the bland side of the plate... but other than that the tenderness of the meat was lovely and for a late night bite; this place is not a bad choice."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here.  I had the Karahi chicken with the salad and naan.  It was very flavourful and you get a lot in one plate.  I also ordered the yogurt drink,  I really enjoyed it.  It was very cooling and perfect for such a warm day.  The place overall was very well kept and quite comfortable.   The service was also friendly and efficient.  They also have takeout if you prefer.  I would  definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Afghan Cuisine offers lunch special before 3 pm.

Tandoori Chicken Leg Kabob ($8.99) which includes a pop sounded like a good value. Sadly the kabob tasted bland and dry. 

The wait time for my lunch in an almost empty restaurant was long. I do appreciate how each order was made when order but 15 minute wait for a fast food like setting? Luckily I was not in a rush.

I do love the deco and spacious interior. Just wish the food could be better!"}
{"text":"When this place is on point, it's honestly amazing. 

While I've been here so many times where it was 5* amazing, there have also been a few instances of 4* Great and 3* ho-hum average.

Regardless, 9 times out of 10 it's epic.

Must tries:

Chicken Seekh Kabob (ground chicken grilled on skewers)
Beef tikka (tenderloin steak)
Chapli Kabob (spicy burger style patties)
Tandoori Chicken Tikka (marinated & grilled pieces of chicken breast)
Grilled Chicken Tikka (marinated & grilled pieces of chicken breast - not spicy)

Also their Firnee dessert is amazing if you like rice pudding or custard type desserts. 

Some people love their lamb shank, i find it fairly pedestrian.
Their Kabli Pilau is just ok.

Avoid their salads. Afghans are not known for their salads. lol

Nice ambience. Parking in that plaza sucks because of all the different restaurants.

Lastly - yes, this place is better then Bamiyan.  Avoid the rush and headache of Bamiyan and eat here instead."}
{"text":"Good place to eat everything freshly made meat, bread and rice. I comes here very often and my favourite dishes are beef skewers, tandoori chicken and Lamb shank dinner. I am so lucky not live close to this location or probably end up eating every day :)

Try the mango shake at the end of your meal great finish to your meal"}
{"text":"I hate to give a place with such amazing food such low marks, but the service here is horrid. The people taking the order have no customer service skills. When we asked for water they have glass, but will give you insulated cups instead when you are eating in. 

The restaurant itself is lovely and seems like a good place to eat, but I would recommend take out only. 

For the owners, please teach your staff some basic customer service skills."}
{"text":"Excellent quality ingredients. Everything is made fresh to order. The portions are generous. I recommend 5pcs tandoori chicken dinner."}
