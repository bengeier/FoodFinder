{"text":"Don tortaco has the best carne Asada fries! My only concern is their guacamole never tastes the same. Sometimes it's good and other times it's not so good. It's a gamble. And I've heard that in groups when people are talking about this location the guacamole flavor always comes up. Also they need like a house salsa. Not just a red and green or pico, have a nice salsa to go with the chips. Other than that everything is tasty. Definitely better than faustos."}
{"text":"OK so the restaurant is kinda scuzzzy, but the food is very very good.   I actually avoided this place for the past five years I lived in the area, but the service is friendly and quick; and the food did not cause heartburn!   It was a great value for the price paid, and tasted good.

Damn, been back to this place 3 times since first review... I love it, more than Lindo"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim while driving into the city from Lake Las Vegas. Ended up going two other times on our trip. Amazing food - friendly staff. My new favorite Mexican joint-"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos.. in town.. head there on Tuesday for breakfast burrito special.  I am so glad I live about 5m from this spot.  The guacamole salsa is to die for."}
{"text":"Got here right before they close at 9pm. My husband and I are staying at the lake Las Vegas resorts and were a little hesitant to eat at the resorts due to the high prices. It's definitely a hole-in-the-wall place but it's really tasty, authentic Mexican food. The men were very sweet and quick. Ordered a Carne Asada torta ($4.95) and my husband ordered an Al Pastor Burrito ($5.40) Very reasonable pricing. Definitely can't beat the prices compared to eating in the resorts. 4 stars, not 5 due to cleanliness."}
{"text":"3 dollar quesadillas for the kids and they are HUGE! The carnitas are bomb. The super chicken nachos are the best in town. This is my go to spot for great, fast, cheap Mexican food."}
{"text":"Blink and you might miss it.  Tucked behind a 7-11, this little taco shop dares to impress.  The carne asada fries and chili rellenos are exceptional. Bravo! The kitchen is clean as well and in full view. Definitely a plus."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. $7.50 got me two chicken tacos and two beef enchiladas. The food lacked spices and was a bit bland but not bad enough to complain. The guys seemed fun and good music playing and TV."}
{"text":"Roberto's Fausto's and Santa Rosa's are all about the same! Good So cal style Grub! 
Rolled Tacos are a staple for me, great bean and cheese burro and 3 hot sauces that all pack a different level of Heat. 
Fast easy and filling! Hey Whittie  try something besides Taco Bell or Dell Taco! I hate seeing best of LAS Vegas Tacos ,AND THE WINNER IS TACO BELL"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Polite and quick service, but the food was very mediocre."}
{"text":"Well, we went to this location because the location off Basic was not operational due to no electricity. This was around 3pm today. So, we decided to go to this location and let me just say...NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL. Ordered nachos and rolled taco supreme. The portions were small and not pleasing to the eye but the BIGGEST complaint that caused us to throw away $14+ of food in the trash was the fact that the rolled tacos were piping HOT. So HOT that it completely melted through the bottom and sides of the styrofoam container. There was no protecting sheet/aluminum foil under neath and it was the HOT oil that didn't feel the greatest on the skin. The nachos had a sheet but still had melted styrofoam in areas. Didn't feel the need to search nor eat around my food to avoid certain areas. So, there is my honest experience at this place. Customer service was not the issue. Unfortunately, it was the preparation and appearance of our meal that caused this a low rating."}
{"text":"For nay one that has had New Mexico food there is different taste and here in Vegas it's hard to find that style. So this is not bad"}
{"text":"I got the carnitas plate and horchata. It was awesome. This place has some of the most authentic Mexican food I have found in the Las Vegas area. So happy I decided to stop here"}
{"text":"Really good legit Mexican food and reasonably priced, love the atmosphere too! Wish I could take this place back to Texas! They even have fresh homemade sour cream and a salsa bar with fresh salsa!"}
{"text":"Cheap, quick, and pretty good mexican food.  The guys working here are usually very friendly and provide quick service.  It isn't exactly the cleanest place, but I never eat in anyways, I usually just take it home since I live close by."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this place in years. Happen to be close by when I was hungry so I figured I'd drop in for a burrito. Still the same great food. The prices have gone up by about a dollar which is understandable because the years have passed. If you like Roberto's style Mexican food this is the place for you if you're in Henderson. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"F this place seriously! I have given this place chance after chance because they are right next to my house, the first time I went there the food was ok, but every time after that it has been horrible, constantly getting my food wrong, one time i got a chile releno and it was seriously burnt and disgusting it tasted like it had been in the freezer for two years then they took it out and put it in the microwave then they have the nerve to charge someoe for it!Also they have seriously rude and incompetent employees. But today they pushed me over the edge, the girl at the register was being so rude, when I was ordering my food she kept stop listening to me to talk and laugh with the other employees and when she gave me my food I asked for a plastic bag because I walked there and she gave me a attitude and threw the bag at me didn't even put my food in it. After I struggled to put small paper bag of food in the plastic bag with one hand because my other hand is broken and in a cast she just stared  at me and didn't ask to help and then i asked her for help and she stated at me with a attitude and didn't help! I've talked to the owner about his employees and food before and he did nothing! I'm so sick of this place and never ever going back!!"}
{"text":"Tasty food at a good price. Salsa bar. I really like the chicken tacos and bean and cheese burritos. My son likes the carne asada fries and chicken fingers."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and super nice employees! Love love love!!! (This location is the BEST!)"}
{"text":"Authentic taqueria in Henderson! First time here, it's nothing fancy and this is why I love it. Quality food, clean atmosphere, and reasonably priced makes for a great establishment."}
{"text":"ive been eating here since i moved in to town 10 years ago. 
i must say the food is great and the deals are awesome. 
i would bring my family from texas and they would say  \"its just like back home\""}
{"text":"I love this place this is one of the hole in the walls mom And Pops Mexican restaurant I would definitely recommend if you're in the mood for Mexican food (702Ro)"}
{"text":"They have two locations, but only one I can conveniently walk to! When I am out, their drive-thru in BOTH locations are super handy ;) Love their traditional food, especially their breakfast burritos...plus they're nice guys to boot! 
P.S. #2 location is just East of Water Street, on Basic."}
{"text":"One of the best Taco Shops in Vegas. It's definitely one to come back to. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! Can't believe I found this place Hidden Gem fucking killer specials everyday.. super friendly staff"}
{"text":"Looks a little scary from outside. Cluttered but super clean inside. Tiny eat in area with a few booths. The food is AMAZING. Fresh fresh fresh. Hone made taco shells loaded with well seasoned chicken, greens and cheese. Creamy refried beans. Ignore the building - go for the food!!"}
{"text":"Was a fan until a bad experience. Attempted to call in an order for pick up, no answer. Placed order through drive thru. Was told that they're out of rice. Really? Mexican restaurant out of rice? Got home to find out that my order was incomplete (they forgot to include order of french fries), one of the combos was ordered no lettuce (lettuce was not held), and the side of nachos were old, stale, and cold.

Will not risk this place again."}
{"text":"This place is a hop, skip, and a jump from my house. It looks a place you might not want to go at night, but it's totally cool and safe. Recently somebody graffiti'd on it \"Be Free\" so there is definitely a hooligan or two roaming about, but it's a positive set of hooligans. Henderson's answer to Banksy, I tell ya.

Anyway, this place far surpasses any Roberto's, ever. Cheese enchiladas to go, plz. The enchilada sauce is super flavorful, if lacking in the spice department. I cover it in the salsas that they give you, but also the guac. The guac is more of a sauce than a dip, but it's really, really good. 

Also, the roll-up tacos. Delicious. And Dr Pepper? Don't tell anybody, but I indulge in the occasional alcoholic beverage, and Dr Pepper and Mexican food are my hangover cures. Santarosa does the trick every time. 

If you're on your way to Lake Mead or Lake Las Vegas, it's worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Nice family owned Mexican place, like the food.  Stop by on your way to the lake!"}
{"text":"Mexican Food, as the signage states, is actually another Santa Rosa Taco Shop that serves up some fantastic and inexpensive Mexican grub. I am a huge fan of the other Santa Rosa Taco Shop in Henderson, but this location is closer to my house so it has become my go-to stop for quick tacos, tortas and burritos.

Blink and you may miss it, as it's tucked slightly behind a convenience store, but even if you pass it this is one stop worth making a u-turn for. The employees are friendly, the portions are large and the prices are right. Santa Rosa serves up my favorite breakfast burritos in town.. just as large as the other places in town, for less money, and the cheese is always fully melted. (That's my breakfast burrito pet peeve, unmelted cheese.)

This isn't the classiest joint, the ambiance is a bit lacking... but the food is legit. The sign outside should really be revised to say Best Mexican Food. It's that good."}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem. Great food and wonderful staff"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast burrito! Dinner is good as well for the camarones al mojo is really good too. It's a small run restaurant and food is made fresh after every order. Can even order drive through but you will still have to wait for your food to be made."}
{"text":"The SantaRosa Taco Shop is a little hole in the wall kind of place - but that is where you often find the best food. This was no exception. I had the BEST carne asada I have ever eaten. So tasty and tender. Prices are very reasonable and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"This place is about 2 minutes from our house, and we have been coming here for 3 years.  We only found out it was called \"Santa Rosa Taco Shop\" after we had been at least a dozen times, when we finally used a check card to pay and got a receipt with the name on it.  We call it Mexican Food, because that's what the sign says out front.

This place is excellent, and you get a lot of food for the money.  We get chimichangas and enchiladas frequently.  The carne asada fries are excellent.  But, I recently started getting breakfast burritos and I highly recommend them.  Better than Roberto's.  This place is well worth finding."}
{"text":"The best tacos we had on our journey out west. This is a family owned business and you can taste it in the food. Don't let the bars on the windows deter you. We popped in a little after 10 am and shortly after all the tables were full. If you're adventurous and like to experience authentic meals, Santarosa will fill your taco, burrito, and menudo needs."}
{"text":"I've passed Santa Rosa many times in the past and have wondered if it was good. When Jessie B told me how much her husband and herself loved it I knew I had to give it a try. 

If you aren't looking for Santa Rosa you just might miss it. It's a tiny building in between a 7-11 and a boat shop. They even have a drive thru. Inside is your standard Mexican taco shop. I immediately saw they had a pastor Chimichanga that came with rice and beans. I also ordered a cheese enchilada and chicken taco combo for my mom. The pastor Chimichanga was crispy and covered in guacamole and sour cream. The pastor was tender and full of that chili lime flavor that I love. The beans and rice were perfect too. My mom's order was cheesy which she enjoyed. Her chicken taco also had great flavor.

If you aren't feeling like getting out of your car Santa Rosa even has a drive thru. I can't wait to go back for another chimichanga. I've also heard they have a killer breakfast burrito! Yay for Santa Rosa! Yummy food and at prices that won't break the bank! Plus, it's right in my Hendertucky hood."}
{"text":"So being a Native from Arizona and Latina .. I'm pretty picky on my Mexican food. This little hole-in-the-wall, which is been here for years, is seriously what brings him back to my Mom's Kitchen. The food is definitely authentic. The people cooking the food definitely must know my mom. LOL. If you are looking for great Mexican food in Henderson, that tastes like your mom's, THIS is a place to go to! The beef wet burrito is to die for! (And I meant to say that with an accent haha.) The Caldo de Rez is also amazing not to mention the Menudo. I can go on and on and on, but I don't think Yelp will allow me to write a book. If you're in the area definitely stop in and try this place. I've been yearning for great Mexican food since I moved here 4 years ago and this is the place where it's at."}
{"text":"Looks a little questionable from the outside. But honestly I was blown away with how good the food was. Tried a carne asada burrito and both pork and carne asada tacos. I want to try more things just because it was so good!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the one on basic but was closer to this one. I ordered my usual carnita asada fries and it was a disaster. Asked not to put a lot of pico and they did the opposite by adding extra. They also forgot the guacamole and sour cream :-( the area also looks a bit scary."}
{"text":"The owner Cesar is a very nice man. I would come back just because he is the owner. Great food also."}
{"text":"Simply put 3 days in the area, 4 trips to this restaurant! Just plain good food made fresh. Breakfast was a great start and dinner was great too. Will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Real Mexican food. Reminds me of home, San Jose CA, city where the best Mexican food is served outside of Mexico. They use fresh meat, the owner is very friendly. Carne asada, pollo, and pesco is good! Try it all!"}
{"text":"My dad and I debated the food rating, between 3&4 but we agreed we go back.  Cleanliness, price and friendliness push it to a 4.  Perfect quick simple bite to eat.  Given the dozens of eggs racked in the cooler, this must be a great breakfast burrito stop I'm the morning."}
{"text":"I've never had a problem my family loves this place when ever I'm in the area I stop by and the cooks are always pleasant and they work very fast"}
{"text":"Price is on par with other taco shops in Vegas. This place even has a few daily specials. 
- chips way less greasier than most places
- guac almost exact same \"pudding-ish\" texture as other places
- salsa bar has about 2 extra choices compared to others


My torta was good, but not great. I've had better. The bread fell apart half way through eating it. Had average flavor, with nothing jumping out that I needed to try it again in the future.

$.99 Taco Tuesday chicken taco was good but smaller than Roberto's Wed Taco Day.. but both tasted about the same..

Edit: Tried chicken strips this time. They looked nothing like the photos. They were VERY thin, and I had to look at the inside of a couple to make sure they weren't fish sticks, as that was their consistency.

Also, I need to mention that this is literally the loudest restaurant I've been to in a long time. We're not talking Italian family spaghetti joint. We're talking about the only dude working here yelling and streaming jokes and comments in Spanish. It honestly doesn't bother me, as I'm loud, but it would bother any date I could bring here."}
{"text":"First time there. The food is mediocre. The meat is a low quality cut. Not skirt steak. Chile relleno was hard. Rice was old and flowery like dough.  Still haven't found a good place here in town salsa is watery very watery"}
{"text":"I'm so happy to be back within a mile of this hidden gem!!!!! Blows Robertos out of the water"}
{"text":"Santarosa is a wonderful and authentic hole in the wall Mexican restaurant. The portions are massive and the price is incredibly cheap. I ordered the bean and cheese burrito with pico de gallo and guacamole - it was delicious! And the largest burrito I've ever ordered. Make sure to come hungry."}
