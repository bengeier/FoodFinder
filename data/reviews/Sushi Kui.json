{"text":"Not the best of the best, but a good, competitive shush location. I have eaten in previously, this time I ordered to go.   Service is usually good. They're not always the fastest, but the staff are polite and friendly enough! The decor is dated and kind of kitschy.   This round of ordering to go, I got the green dragon roll, shrimp sushi and seaweed salad. The salad was great, the portion was definitely exceeding expectation.  The rice was cooked a little more than I'd like in my green dragon roll, but was good with my sushi. The tempura in the roll was soggy by the time I got home 15 minutes later. That with the rice and mayo made it a soggier roll than I've had at other locations.   The prices were either the same or less than other locations, and I was in the area, but I'd recommend other locations if you're able to, as it wasn't my fave. The extra $2 a roll goes a long way at other establishments."}
{"text":"For all-you-can-eat... it did its job. The food came out quickly. We had an issue with something we ordered and it was dealt with accordingly."}
{"text":"Went to this place on Canada Day for their all you can eat dinner menu and it was a horrible experience. Definitely wasnt worth the 25.98 .  Layout First of all, the seating arrangements are ridiculous, they have tables set up in unreachable corners and expect ppl sit there, they have a table hitched onto a side piece of the wall, a table of three for that matter with the third person sitting in the middle of the aisle facing the wall.. one table that's in the corner is too close to the window with the open sign plug dangling on your arm and the drapes probably go into the food. Also, the washroom is in a stupid place, its as if someone is going to the washroom on your table, they have squeeze behind you and then you a whiff of whatever they did when they open it.. the table should be somewhere else.   Service It wasn't even busy when we got there, yet we waited half an hr just to get our orders and our complimentary orders which should have come first, they offer two complimentary dishes and we only got one, their excuse was that it was busy in the kitchen so it would probably come out later on, but it never did. We waited forever to get a refill on our water, we had to wave someone down for that. They only give one napkin each which we also had to beg for. It just took way too long to get anything.. we ordered 3 times and we didn't even get most of our stuff from the first sheet, and again their excuse was it was busy in the kitchen so order it again. Also, as we sat there we saw many ppl come in for take out but they also waited about an hr to get their food and still left disappointed.  Food Everything wasn't horrible, but most things were. the beef teriyaki was chewy, beef rib had too much fat, spicy salmon roll was not like it should have been, it was made like a salmon salad with chives and some kind of sweet mayo which was disgusting! they are stingy with their fish pieces, i got rainbow roll and the pieces of fish on top were so thin like a little piece of paper. The shrimp and crab tempura was so greasy like it was literally a bowl of grease.. The shrimp skewers tasted like it came out of a sand pit.. we ordered that on our first sheet and didn't even get it until an hr later. the chicken was good which was probably the only thing. We got mango and strawberry ice cream which was the highlight of the whole visit along with our departure.  if it was possible i would have only given them half a star.. we definitely will not be coming here again unless its free (maybe not even then)."}
{"text":"There are many sushi restaurants in Aurora and New market but this place is hands down one of the best. The servers are friendly, the food is great and the restaurant is clean. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because the chairs are in need of replacement."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and every time I come here, I'm disappointed with the food. I love spicy salmon rolls buy their roll is mushy.  It doesn't have distinguishable bits of salmon and why is it seeping out of the roll as I pick it up with my chopsticks?! That was the biggest thing for me. Otherwise, I just didn't find the price worth the quality of food.  I've been to a lot of other AYCE places that charge the same and the food is a lot better than this place."}
{"text":"I am a big, big fan of Sushi Kui. The sushi is the best I've ever had. I have friends that drive up from downtown Toronto because they also feel that it's the best Sushi they've ever had.  Beautiful ambience and very friendly staff that has been incredibly sweet and good to my now 4 year-old daughter ever since she was an infant and joining me on my Sushi excursions. When she was a baby/toddler they used to ASK me to give her ice cream on the house. Very, very sweet service that makes those of us dining with kids feel more welcome and comfortable."}
{"text":"I'm pretty shocked that there are so many bad reviews and rating.  I've been going to Sushi Kui for about 6 years now and I swear they have the best sushi in town. I don't know anybody personally who has gone and not liked it.  It can get very busy around lunch time but I've never had to wait super long.  The only time I have had to wait is when I do pick up (I know, I know sushi taboo) Plan to come pick up your food 10 min after they say it will be ready."}
{"text":"Not only is the food delicious and presented beautifully, but the service in this restaurant is impeccable.   Orders are always taken in a timely fashion with a very friendly and welcoming attitude.   If you order an alcoholic beverage they offer you a free dish that is not normally included in the all you can eat menu. The food comes out fresh and fast. They are ready to take your order again, and never keep you waiting. Garbage and empty plates are removed before you even realize it and your water glass will never be empty. The all you can eat menu is very reasonably priced.   The restaurant is very clean and well maintained and overall the experience is always a good one.  I highly recommend this restaurant to any of my friends."}
{"text":"It was really quite terrible.  The sashimi was so tiny.  It looked like they cut up a regular size sashimi into halves and served that.  The salmon had no taste.  Surf clam looked mangled up.  The rainbow roll had a very skimpy piece of salmon and white tuna(?) on top of a California roll that was mainly made of rice.  The beef teriyaki was very tough.  Beef short ribs were dry. The spicy roll was drenched in spicy mayo.    Only good thing I can say is the do a good job deep frying the tempura and agedashi tofu and the green tea ice cream was soft.  I definitely will not come back."}
{"text":"my experiences here in the past have been pretty underwhelming, if I am being honest. I believe that going here for dinner is a different experience than going here for lunch. I had only been here for lunch. And while I've never had a BAD experience here, I've never felt particularly enthused to go.  My opinion on Sushi Kui has shifted from what I'd consider 3 stars to a now very generous 4 stars. I went here for a work christmas party, and the food and service was not what I'm accustomed to from this place. By which I mean it was far better.  We were a large group so I have nothing but respect for service staff that have to deal with any party larger than four. They remained patient, polite, and friendly throughout the evening - not the nonchalant service I'm used to here (again not BAD just not great).  The food was fantastic. There were a few people from our party that were having sushi for the first time, and I'm glad the quality was where it was at that evening, so that they had a good first impression. They also gave us a few starters on the house for us to nosh on before our orders arrived. A really nice touch that I'm sure is only reserved for large parties, but still greatly appreciated nonetheless!  I know that sushi pizza is nowhere near authentic and is a product of refining cuisine for different pallets, but I just really love it. And the one I had that evening was as good as any I've tried.  I have a feeling that they take more care in the evening, and that more things are cut/fried/made to order. If I have dinner here again that was as good as this recent experience, then I'll feel that the 4 stars is deserved and not me being generous. We shall see!"}
{"text":"Before the arrival of AYCE sushi chain Aji Sai, finding decent AYCE Sushi options in Aurora were a little difficult to find. This is an predominantly white town where people like their fish battered and fried as opposed to raw and on rice.   It wasn't  long ago that Sushi Kui decided to open it's doors in a most unique venue choice. Nestled in the center of the courtyard of the St. Andrew's Plaza located at the corner of Yonge and Orchard Heights. Entering from Orchard Heights is a rookie move and it will take you 2-3 times to figure out that if you enter one street north of Orchard heights that you have direct access to the restaurants front doors.  You think I'm joking but I've been walking through the courtyard and seen people looking around lost and when I ask what they're looking for... well you know where this is going.   In terms of Sushi, I find this place to be hit or miss but they tend to er more on the side of hit rather than miss. Their rolls are fairly good and aren't overdone with rice. The fish is fresh and cold when it's served and the cuts are always more than fair for AYCE.  Definitely worth checking out if you find yourself caught in Aurora, afraid to venture further north and too lazy to cart yourself back to AYCE sushi heaven in Richmond Hill/Markham.  Hot tip: They offer 10% discount on certain weekdays (Lunch and Dinner) call ahead to find out what days are being offered that week. Winter time it's Mon - Thursday  Eatcrest Outtie!"}
{"text":"I came here with a family member for AYCE dinner. Sushi Kui charges $23.99 for adults which I found to be a bit high (relative to some downtown joints which charge $20.95 or less). The maki was excellent (the spicy rolls were delicious - the rest were still a cut above average in my opinion), but what really stood out to me was the service. The manager was very kind - he paid close attention to our table and even asked if I needed a phone to call a parent to pick me up (I'm in university but I suppose I look younger than I am!). Again, it was a bit pricey but I thought the care that the restaurant pays to both presenting its dishes well and making patrons feel welcome was wonderful. It's an elegant restaurant that is worth a visit if you're in the area - if not, I'd recommend you take advantage of the 15% cash discount on take-out orders!"}
{"text":"Just an ordinary all you can eat ($18 for dinner). In fact i would say the menu choices are less than most other all you can eat. Service was okay. Food was okay. I really enjoyed the onion beef. Nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"It's okay for all you can eat there not a lot of options  ... after our first round they asked us if we were done lol. I' didn't like it I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO!!! Terrible! I would not give any star if possible. A total rip off! A love boat for two cost $35.95 and out of the 16 pieces of sashimi, we get 6 pieces of IMITATION CRAB MEAT! Poor quality food, horrible presentation. I haven't had such bad Japanese food for a long time!!! Garbage!"}
{"text":"I love this sushi place. Awesome service and the sushi is super fresh. Location is beautiful too. One of the best AYCE around."}
{"text":"I have had dinner here on a few occasions over the last 2 years and I have enjoyed it every time. The service and food are really good. They also feature complimentary special items if you do AYCE. I will revise my review later to include specific items that we have ordered and enjoyed but I usually get the same things: dynamite roll, spicy California roll, etc."}
{"text":"I love sushi kui AYCE!  On Tuesday nights I believe it is 10% off and it's worth it even at full price.  We usually sit in the back room and it's always a full house.  This place has really good spicy salmon rolls and tempura rolls.  The sushi is fresh and it never smells funny here at all.  They have specialty rolls too like green dragon and red dragon included in the AYCE.  They also have a variety of pizzas - we always order the crab pizza.  It's good because the crab is shredded on top, not just sticks of crab."}
{"text":"Sushi Kui was pretty good. It is pretty inside and even has a patio! The food came out at a good pace (which is essential when you're doing all you can eat). We did find a bit too much rice on their green dragon rolls. Their spicy salmon did little for me, but their philidelphia rolls stole the show. Dang. I'd go back and only order those next time. They're so creamy and delicious.  Lunch on a Sunday was $14.  A Shirley Temple (which was amazing) is $4.99.  Aurora has great weekend prices for all you can eat sushi!  Also: They charge 50 cents for uneaten rice supposedly."}
{"text":"We had a sit down dinner as well as got take-out once. The place needs some renovations and furniture replacement, but overall they have a pretty cozy interior.  Food is tasty but we found it greasy (or too much fat - like a lot of mayo in some sushi), but it depends on what you order, it's up to the guest.  Cleanliness is so-so (may be it looks that way because they need renovations and some organization inside the restaurant)."}
{"text":"Coming from Markham where dozens of AYCE are here. I was personally not very impressed with the quality, service and seating area.  First off,  there was barely light in the restaurant.. its too dark inside and the tables are so close and small to each the next.. comfort level close to none..   Secondly,  the choices were really limited and I really didn't like the fact how some rolls are 6 pieces and some are 1...I know this happens at other AYCE 's but there are leaways in that @ most other places...   Thirdly,  service wasn't great...waters not being refilled until asked, plates kept on piling up and we literally had no spot on the table to keep empty dishes...so service is a big NO NO...   Now the most important part, the food...the rice to toppings ratio was not very well put together.. way too much rice to stuff u but not enough toppings...e.g. spicy salmon roll, green dragon roll and etc...too much rice...   $1.99 for a can of ice tea.. seriously?! most places includes drinks.. at least during lunch...I know dinner is usually not included but lunch alot of places already included...   At the end of the day, couldn't finish the food was charged $6 for uneaten food...alot of places do specify of such but if its not a huge amount..they let it go mostly.. I had like maybe 6-8 pieces left...so I was quite unhappy with the overall experience..   I can only say due to being in Aurora where sushi choices are so limited...hence the 4**...ppl, come to Markham and eat!!"}
{"text":"I was clearly on a sushi kick last week as I decided to get lunch takeout.  I decided to check this place out as it wasn't too far from work.  It's in a plaza that has several other stores that you can wander around - but it's in the middle of the plaza so you need to walk in...you can't see it from the parking lot which was why I was a bit confused trying to find it.  Once I did I walked in and noticed it's a pretty big place.  They were pretty busy for lunch time which I thought was a good thing. Ordering for takeout is done at the counter - unfortunately this took longer that I had hoped.  Finally I ordered the salmon bento box - if you pay cash it's 15% off!  Sweet!    I got back to work and opened my lunch up and was disappointed - the saddest looking salmon on some tired looking rice.  The 2 egg rolls were so soggy b/c they had been sitting in their chili sauce.  The miso soup was ok.  The pieces of sushi were tiny.    Not impressed at all.  Maybe the dine in experience might be better but I am not going to try that out any time soon.  Much better places elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is really good overall.  The all you can eat is pricey but generally speaking its sushi is fresh and the service is good.  The layout of the restaurant is tight and if you go when its busy the seating can get a little uncomfortable for families with kids.  Some days we order ala carte and if you aren't gonna eat a lot its a good idea, I would say its one of the top in the area and the location is nice."}
{"text":"***WARNING***  DO NOT GO HERE!!   We found 2 worms in our Sashimi!!!! When we informed the waitress she was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional and quickly took away the plate! I wish we took a picture but we didn't. The service prior to even finding the worm was HORRIBLE! I don't even know how this place is in business! It's so old, run down, DIRTY and just a major turn off of a restaurant. They didn't compensate us in anyway for the worms in our food. disgusting place do not go here and do not let anybody you know go here!"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi in Aurora.  I've been here several times and it never disappoints.  Reasonably prices with excellent service.   Try the tex-mex roll!"}
{"text":"I came here for salmon sashimi to take out for lunch. Very well presented, quick in preparation and very nice employees who greet you right away!   The sashimi was very good and tasted fresh and just right!  They have an outdoor patio too!!!!   I will definitely be back. And will dine in!"}
{"text":"Was a bit nervous about an all you can eat! Portions were good, food was delicious, price was great!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I think I've been to too many AYCE sushi restaurants that if a space only offers standard items on their menu it's getting a mediocre rating in my eyes  At Sushi Kui you order off of a list of items on the paper. Unfortunately they don't include any pictures of any of the items, but some of them do tell you how many pieces is in a serving.   I went for weekend lunch, which was $15 a person, you could also opt for the more expensive dinner menu for $25 at lunch as well. Most of their foods are alright, nothing stood out in particular for me. Though I gotta point out that they don't use the proper round sushi rice to make their nigiri and rolls. The rice they end up using is kinda rough and feels undercooked. Portions wise I'm not a big fan of how little fish they give you on the rolls, it's basically just eating a chunk of rice with some cucumber and avocado.   Btw if you order enough items they might serve you in a boat, which is a really touch that I don't usually see at many other AYCE sushi restaurants.  I probably wouldn't come back again, but for anyone looking for a decently priced AYCE sushi restaurant this place isn't too bad...Didn't get an upset stomach afterwards, which is a plus :P"}
{"text":"I'd like to start this review with something positive.  I have been here once in the past around Christmas and they offered a special festive roll which was delicious. The service my friends and I experienced was fine. The flavor was great and at that time, the portions were small which is a-ok with me.  I returned in summer and was thoroughly disappointed with the experience. The flavor was okay and the service was pleasant at first. I found the portions to be massive and so I started to pick off heaps of rice. I don't mind paying extra for unfinished rice, in fact, I knew I would and was 100% okay with it because less rice is my personal preference. The waitress told me I would be charged and I accepted that and continued to eat. When I went to place a second order, she asked me if I would be \"finishing my food this time\". I told her to please charge me for the unfinished rice and to process the next order. She told me she wouldn't be able to unless I committed to finishing the entire order. I explained that I understand there is a charge and am okay with paying for the left overs. After a few exchanged words, my friends and I asked for the bills since we weren't getting anywhere and I wasn't \"allowed\" to put in another order.  Needless to say, I will not be returning. This place had potential until the customer service went down the tube.  See ya never, Sushi Kui."}
{"text":"I often pick up or request delivery from here and the service is very fast. Kitty who is always working is very warm and welcoming. As far as the food goes, it conforms to the tastes of its customers. I would recommend the Spicy Tuna or Spicy Salmon hand roll/maki. Their spicy mayo is perfect!"}
{"text":"Really terrible Japanese restaurant. Ordered $11 sashimi bento for lunch, sashimi size is terribly small, over all food quality is below average, no recommend."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times. Excellent ayce. Fresh and plump portions. Great service. Cute, cozy atmosphere (front room better)."}
