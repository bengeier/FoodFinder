{"text":"I generally like Majerle's.  I've used the Cotton Room for my birthday celebration a couple of times.   Food is good, it's a good central location and its convenient when we go downtown for a game, D'Backs, Suns or Mercury or shows.   
Very disappointed in the service/attitude of the staff tonight.  We were seated in the back section,  we were the second group to be seated back there.  Several other groups came in and were waited on much faster.  Groups that came in after us, had drinks and food before we got drinks.  The groups were leaving when we finally got our food.   NOT happy with today's service and the fact we sat there for sometime without service.  Food was good, no problems with that, I think the waitress was inexperienced or just lazy."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly, the food is tasty, and there are so many tv's. I highly recommend this place for a game, dinner, or a drink."}
{"text":"had an opportunity to go to majerle's sports bar after work as a company farewell event for one of our managers who was relocating back to cali.  we sat outside and it was hot. dont recall if they had outdoor ceiling fans or misters but if they did, they definitely didnt turn them on.  maybe if we were indoors my experience might have been different.  tried their chicken quesadilla and it was very tasty.  their chips and salsa were okay too.  our waitress was attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"Last night I stopped here for a bite to eat had never been before and was very disappointed with their lack of service and terrible food. After sitting at the near empty bar for 10 minutes I finally decided to reach around and get myself a menu, I was never greeted or welcomed. The bar tender was nice as I placed my order. When the food arrived (Filet Mignon sliders and old school nachos) the extremely thin slice of meat on a huge bun was over cooked and the nachos were more like a small bowl of chips with some olives green chillies and lightly sprinkled with unmelted cheese. The most pathetic display of food I've ever seen. I asked for more cheese but by the time it came I realized there's no way I was going to pay 12$ for those nachos I honestly didn't want to pay for the sliders either since of the 4 I really only had enough to meat for one and ditched 3 of the buns but went ahead and did anyway. When the manager came to ask what was wrong with the food I told him and he argued with me saying they brought me more cheese and tried to negotiate a discount rather then removing the item that I wasn't even going to eat because of how bad it was. He eventually decided to remove the item. This was a terrible experience and I wont be back nor will I refer anyone to this establishment I don't see them being in business much longer. On a side note the bartender did apologize and was really polite so of course she still got a 30% tip."}
{"text":"Nachos are chips with Taco Bell meat and obvious nacho cheese from a pump. The beer selection is weak at best. Noisy and the atmosphere is more dive bar than lounge. Will avoid in the future."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here wondering how long it'll take the server to come by. She's spent most of her time talking around the front desk. I guess if you want to pay someone to just stand around you have the right people. If you want service don't come here.,"}
{"text":"Went here for a few drinks after the super bowl and ended up ordering a few rounds for some ladies we had met there.  When I got the bill, it was $250 and we were there for about a half hour to 45 min and had 5 rounds of washington apples.  I couldn't believe it, and I didn't feel like that was right, and was going to try and maybe negotiate the bill down some with the manager.  Next words out of his mouth were either pay it or I'm calling the cops, just an a-hole about it...total clip joint and highway robbery...Whatever I paid it but probably will never come back here"}
{"text":"I went yesterday to watch the Chicago and Houston football game with some friends.  I arrived after they have finished eating, but the food left on their plates did not appealing.  So, I ordered a Long Beach Tea, which is similar to the Long Island but instead they put a splash of cranberry on top.  I liked that drink, but the waitress did not come back with my change (after I gave her a $20.00).  When she finally arrived back to the table, I had to remind her that I gave her a $20.00 a needed my change, she apologized.  I must say, that that type of stuff does happen especially when a place is busy.  

For food I went to enjoy slices at the two pizza restaurants just around the corner (see reviews)

At the end of the game they switched some of the tvs over to 80s videos, which is throughly enjoyed and started to do my signature Sexy Robot move to!

I do not think I will be back.  I will just check out El Hefe next time.

Cheers"}
{"text":"Best food in the area for sure. They serve till two am on the weekends. The girls here have great personalities. Management is super nice. Great service. Great prices."}
{"text":"Food was great!  Loved the burgers!  Plus, we were there on a Friday night and got to dance the night away with the Marley Taylor band, we had a fantastic time!  Live music at Desert Ridge!!  We came in for dinner & stayed for the party!"}
{"text":"I have gone here a couple of times for a pregame to events at US Airways Center.  This time was no exception. 

I would describe the place as a upscale sports bar.  The service was great, I always had something to drink and the food has always been tasty.

I had the Buffalo chicken wrap with French fries. I would definitely order this again! It was absolutely delicious!!  I also had a spicy bloody mary which was standard, as well as some mimosas.  The mimosas were delicious and came with a mini bottle of champagne in its own little \"ice bucket\".  Which was just one part of an ice shaker with the mini bottle nestled inside, but it was genius :)

The happy hour looked nice but was not valid during event nights, which was disappointing.  I will definitely visit again :)"}
{"text":"Terrific sports bar. Good food Re4asonably priced. great atmosphere"}
{"text":"They did have unique items to Majerle's, but for the most part typical sports bar grub. The service was outstanding!! The best I have had ina long time.... Well worth the visit..."}
{"text":"I was having drinks and lunch on 5/21/16 @ 2pm with my sister at this location. My experience in this establishment was absolutely amazing. Our waitress Marissa was amazing in every sense of the word! She was fast with service, recommended a great burger, and was very personable with us. Her personality is awesome and she made the whole experience perfect. Another waitress would come by my table to make sure we were doing good while Marissa was taking care of other patrons. Her name is Summer and she as well is an awesome employee! Very personable and polite. Because of Marissa and Summer I will come back to this establishment!!! Both of these ladies are assets to this company! 
Thanks Marissa n Summer for a wonderful time!

{"text":"Came in here for a bite to eat for the Cardinals game.  Ordered the taco salad with spicy beef.  Wish it would have been served in a tortilla shell, but the salad was good overall.  They have White Ale on tap which was delicious. Bf had the teriyaki chicken and rice - pretty good.  Friend loved the grilled chicken sandwich with sprouts and avocado.  Overall great atmosphere and service. Will return."}
{"text":"Hello Yelp Family,

I would like to share the experience I had at Majerle's Downtown Phoenix.
My girlfriend and I attended their MLK event held on Saturday, January 14, 2012. My first issue with this establishment was the parking or lack thereof. Now I am new here to Phoenix from California and I am familiar with dining downtown. However, most establishments will validate your parking if they do not provide parking and your only option is to use the parking garage. I paid $12 to park in the parking garbage situated adjacent to Merle's and was advised upon arrival that they do not validate parking. I was also advised that the entrance for the MLK celebration was a block down on Washington??? That was a little weird for me especially during a MLK celebration....what are we in the 50's where blacks enter from the back???? That did not sit well with me. Another  issues I had with this place was the DJ. He came over and introduced himself as the DJ from Chicago. He was by far the worst DJ I have ever heard. The music was from one extreme to the other. There was skipping and long pauses between songs. I think Connor Cruise (Tom Cruise's son) would have done a better job. Lastly, the drinks were watered down. It was the first time I had a long island ice tea, that actually taste like ice tea with no alcohol. I will give Majerle's 2 stars. One because the food looked appetizing, although I didn't eat anything and one star because it was the first time since I've lived in Phoenix, that I encounter other black professionals over 30. I am still looking for a place where upscale professional black people over 30 mingle."}
{"text":"We were down the street and wanted to grab a bite somewhere new. As soon as we got there, there was a bit of confusion because the hostess was not present. When she finally showed up we told her that we wanted to sit outside and she directed us to a table that had not yet been clean and told us to sit while someone came over to clean it up. Eventually she took on the duty, but never introduced herself or asked us if we had ever dined there before. Khris and I looked at each other and just shrugged our shoulders and made nothing of it.

Later our waitress arrived and took our drink orders, but a pattern emerged as she also failed to tell us her name or greet is in a kind manner. When she came back we ordered our food and both chose the Sweet Cajun Burger which was amazing! The patty was spicy, the sauce was sweet, and Khris enjoy the bread the most. Though thin, the fries were very tasty and were plentiful as well.

We give the food the highest compliment, but the service was subpar. Given that it's a well known restaurant and a highlight in the downtown area, we expected a bit more."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Friendly staff.  Had a great time playing their Trivia game (Tues nights)."}
{"text":"ever been to dick's last resort? you know, the restaurant we're the servers are intentionally angry and mean because its funny (kinda) and its the theme? well, this should be majerles theme cuz the service is horrid, horrid, horrid. ive never had even mediocre service there. in fact, most of their \"servers\" seem to lack a pulse...something that should be manditory for the position. how these people survive on tips is beyond me...americans are just generous people i guess."}
{"text":"I think this place stays in business only because of Majerle's name.  The food is terrible. Had a Reuben tonight and the corned beef had been grilled until it was rubbery.  Mushy 'kraut and the unfortunately ubiquitous marble rye (for people who don't like rye bread!) Had a French dip earlier this yeatat the downtown location. Meat was also rubbery in that sandwich.  Both were overpriced given the quality and portion size.  This location was better when it was Wolfley's. It looked almost the same but the food was far better, even though it was just average.  The service tonight was also very inattentive. I guess they get decent tips from beer-drinking sports fans, so why work hard?"}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars only because Carissa, our server, was friendly and attentive. Had the French Dip for lunch. It was awful.  The beef was rubbery and had an off flavor. The au jus was flavorless.  I tried to perk it up with black pepper, but the pepper was old and flavorless. The shoestring fries were crispy but barely warm.  This was the worst lunch I've had in at least a year, and it likely was the worst French Dip I've ever had. The place has lots of televisions, so if you just want to drink beer and watch sports, it's probably fine for that. If you want a decent lunch, there are plenty of very good places within a couple of blocks."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. This was my 3rd or 4th time here and it's had been the same good service and quality each time. I even came for a UFC fight and they had it on all their tv's. Overall very good experience and will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Good place to watch a game but the food is terrible.  Went there about four times and had to send the food back every time because it was cold!"}
{"text":"So I eat here a few times a month, never any complaints, however, ate there yesterday (4 Oct) and had big wills salad( my norm), ate there today, price went up 3 bucks, so now the total is 977 w/ tax, seriously, its a salad!!, lettuce tomato croutons and some other items, 10 bucks for a plain old salad, I am not on a business lunch and a bigger salad ( plain) is still just more lettuce tomatoes etc... no longer a good deal for a good lunch"}
{"text":"The service was good but the food was awful. The nachos were terrible. The bun was extremely soggy on the chicken burger. The Cajun chicken on the chicken Caesar salad was essentially chicken covered in an extreme amount of raw spices that weren't cooked onto the chicken. I couldn't even eat it."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Majerle's several times. Overall the food is decent for a grill, although nothing on the menu is spectacular. 

Our service is good and the myriad TVs to watch sports on can't be beat. 

Our last meal at Majerle's was on a lazy Sunday afternoon and the service was very good. Our waitress took care of us and our food was reliable as usual. 

Majerle's is a great place to hang out and watch sports or to grab a quick bite. There are other grills with better food, but Majerle's makes up for it with atmosphere."}
{"text":"Thought I would try Majerle's Sports Grill for lunch. I haven't been there in about 12 years. I've always liked the atmosphere and it's still nice. Sat at the bar and based on the reviews I've read, I was expecting some great things from the staff. While the service was prompt, it wasn't very friendly. I'm a pretty plain eater, so I had the turkey sandwich, with mayo on the side, The meat was excellent, but the bun was a little disappointing. If I go back, I'll ask for it on white sandwich bread. The prices are a little steep, but with such a location, that's expected (Convention Center across the street and the Suns and Diamondbacks just one block south). For a Monday afternoon, there was quite a crowd there (mostly businessmen and some convention attendees)."}
{"text":"I could not resist the temptation to swing by this restaurant after someone reminded me that Majerle has been experiencing the perils of the restaurant business. The restaurant is big and there are huge screens to watch different sports events. The vibe is nice and the atmosphere similar to places like TG Fridays or BJs. I think Majerle's Sports Grill is a good place to go with a group of friends but always keeping in mind that is a casual, very casual restaurant. Both my drinks and food were a little disappointing; the cocktails were served with little pour, they were so weak that I felt I was drinking lemonade. Then I ordered the Majerle's wings which were cold so I had to ask the waited to place them in a box to take home. I left a little disappointed and that's a bummer because Majerle was one of my childhood idols due to his golden years in Phoenix. Unluckily, the restaurant did not remind me of Majerle's great years in Phoenix, it reminded me of Majerle's performance in 2001 when he was about to retire."}
{"text":"The food is overpriced and so are the drinks. The atmosphere is not casual and the place is not very inviting. The hostess was not friendly and neither was the staff inside. I did not enjoy coming to this place and I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I actually really love this bar. My friends and I like to come here to watch football. The happy hour is pretty great and for bar food the food is actually pretty good. My one complaint and why I give it less stars is we tried coming here for Thursday night football but they have a live radio show airing at the same time. We Come to watch the game since it's nfl network and instead they do a radio show and no sound for the game!!! We would be coming back for the games but with that broadcast we will be going elsewhere where they have sound."}
{"text":"This is a REVIEW ON THE REVIEWS... for crying out loud people, I am looking for a SPORTS BAR, not a damn restaurant. NOT ONE review was about how the SPORTS were able to be watched. How many TV's what is the mix? There are bars in Denver where you can see the game from every seat in the place. WHAT is the Status here... I have no idea, the freaking bar offered ONE photo with the Beer Taps in front of it? So it looks like CRAP. I've 20 people looking to watch a game downtown, I hate chains like Hooters and Tilted Kilt, but it looks like that may be where we are headed."}
{"text":"Food and service was good. We went during lunch and sat in the bar area. Our server was very nice and attentive. I had the potato skins with chicken- delicious! My husband had the Mac & cheese burger- loved it! We would definitely stop here again we when visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"We went last Friday evening, during happy hour...  'happy hour', where the 32 oz mini pitchers were $10.  The bartender tried to make that seem like a good deal, but when Zipps has 32 oz mugs for $3.75 (HH) and Pranksters Too charges about $5 (HH), why in the world would we go to back to Majerle's?  There were only about 6 other people in the place, and now we know why.  Nice enough place, but just not worth it."}
{"text":"It was a great spot for some quick delicious food and beers prior to heading to a D-Backs game!"}
{"text":"Food is not very good but the people that work there and their service are outstanding! Very friendly good place to hang out!"}
{"text":"One star for service and overall nice atmosphere. Came to watch football game. Unfortunately, food was awful; beware!"}
{"text":"Try to play an order over the phone and I was sent to voice mail twice and the third time an employee picked and told me \"quit F**kn calling here\"  I was blown away at the grade A customer service I've received at 11:50pm. I'm glad to know these guys hire people who go above and beyond."}
{"text":"Same Majerle's menu as the other locations.  Decent food (especially wings), but high prices for both food and drink.  Good service -- even overattentive on my last visit.  Great setup for watching football games."}
{"text":"We stopped by Happy Hour this past Friday.  The place was about half full with quite a few open booths/tables.  Very nice hostess led us to a booth (#33 I now know). Our drink order was taken and was being delivered when we were asked if we would mind switching to the booth \"next door\" (which I now know is #32).  We were sort of confused but figured there must be some real reason for it and of course obliged.  
Just then a \"management-type\" with blonde Pippy Longstocking braids (the type a 7-year old MIGHT wear if her mother insisted), brandishing a big phony grin, descended upon our booth (#32) and gave us a lecture about how we were inadvertently placed at the sacred #33 booth by an in-training hostess (she did her job very well) who didn't realize  that booth was RESERVED by a family of 3 who have been coming to this restaurant for a very long time (by the way, as have we), and expect to be able to sit at THAT BOOTH (#33) every time they come in!   We honestly just stared at her.
Pippy swept by our table several more times (on her way to kissing up to these mysterious self-described VIPs at #33), but ignored us the rest of the evening.  The waitress was very good and efficient and the food was good as well.  Just this weird treatment by \"management\" was very strange."}
{"text":"This was our first stop upon arrival in Scottsdale and we were welcomed by two great people Sam & Katie. They were very friendly, serving great beers and food. We will definately be back - Pete & Shazz (UK)"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Its a neat place to hang out, relax, eat some really tasty food. I must be fair and say that I am stuck on 2 different sandwiches. The Jared Dudley, and the Joe Klein Burger. I suggest ask if they can butterfly the chicken breast on the Jared Dudley because it can be sort of thick without, and I usually ask for an extra side of blue cheese ( I like it with the fries too) adding a little more to burger. The blue cheese is really good, and the buns they use are like the Hawaiian dinner rolls everyone eats at Thanksgiving.... The meat is really good too. my favorite burger now. Check my other posts to see that I don't say that about everything."}
{"text":"Good happy hour prices. I enjoy a patio seating area, but every time I sit out there the service is really slow. Bartenders are attentive and quick so if you do go it's best to sit at the bar.

I like the corn hole, it's fun to play games when out with friends. Trivia Tuesday is also attractive. Normally there aren't a lot of people there after dinner hours. If you want somewhere to mingle and meet new people this is not it. If you have a group of people who just want to drink beer and watch sports on TV this is better for you."}
{"text":"We have been going to Majerle's for years. The atmosphere, the food and the service are always good. The prices have always been reasonable."}
{"text":"Went in on a very slow Wednesday night. The place was fully staffed, though, no one wanted to acknowledge us. There were only about 7 other customers. After 5 solid minutes of being passed by, I finally got my own menu. The server who FINALLY came over couldn't have been more rude and obviously didn't want to be there. The food was good, which is why it's getting any stars. The experience itself was awful! Every person working there should be fired! Even the couple sitting next to us came over on their way out to ask how our server was! They wrote her \"comment\" on their bill. Lol . If your desperate for food while downtown then go for it, but otherwise, stay away."}
{"text":"Such a horrid experience from the moment we walked in the door!!  Ignorant and inexperienced reception staff and inept shift manager were completely out of synch with general principles of modern customer service.  They won't miss me at this disgusting place, but I won't miss them either."}
{"text":"Great sports bar.  New, but has the feel of a place that's been around for awhile.  The quesadilla is good, and the sunday drink specials are great!  Thanks Thunder Dan for opening one of your joints in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We had a great lunch! Highly recommend the Rojo Diablo chicken sandwich! Loved the fries too!"}
{"text":"Lipstick on a pig.  Nice atmosphere, attractive staff.  But being cute only goes so far in life and in the restaurant industry.  I gave the bartender (Marissa, I think?) a second chance after she was a snob on my first visit.  Strike two and Majerle's is out.  Getting conversation out of the barstaff is like pulling teeth unless you have a popped collar and a Jersey Shore tan.  Exactly what a bar should NOT be."}
{"text":"I stopped into the downtown location of Majerle's while in Phoenix on business.  The food was good but nothing to write home to mom about as it was just your typical bar grub.  However, the joint was clean, the beer was cold and the wait staff was friendly and hot...this place is A-OK with me lol"}
{"text":"We went here with some friends after a movie. I got the $10 chef salad. It was gross. For $10 I was expecting the ham and turkey to be from real whole pieces of ham and turkey, but instead it was chopped up cold cuts. Salty and cheap tasting. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Terrible service disappointing experience. Took my daughters there on Sunday.  There were three other occupied tables in the entire place, and at least as many employees as there were customers so it's not like they were super busy. Ordered drinks and that's the last time we spoke to our waitress until we paid our tab. The restaurant was virtually empty but they still seated a group of people directly behind us instead of spacing it out a little. Waited about 20 minutes until the group behind us got their first round of food and we still had not seen the waitress to place an order. Said we were done and wanted to pay the tab and leave and the waitress and hostess were unapologetic and frankly couldn't care any less that they ignored us the entire time we were there. Used to be a great restaurant but they really spiraled into a sad empty place with terrible service. Went down the road to Black Angus and had a lovely time with great customer service and delicious food. We won't be making the Majerle's mistake again. It's sad to see a promising business lose sight of something as basic as customer service, and fail. Now I know why the place was virtually empty."}
{"text":"Judging by some of the reviews, maybe I went on good days because I've enjoyed my trips.  Good food and good service.  

The last time I went, I sat at the bar for lunch on a Sunday, ordered an All~Star Burger with BBQ sauce and enjoyed some sports.  The bartender was nice and the food came quick, which was good because I was hungry (I inhaled the burger).

I'll be returning on a regular basis once football starts back up."}
{"text":"Make sure that if you use a debit or credit card to check your receipt & bank account because the waiter sure likes to add a additional  tip and help themselves.I had to call my bank and dispute the additional charge . Such a disappointment for a well known bar.."}
{"text":"Great place to go for something to eat after being downtown either for a game or concert. Waiters Waitresses and Bartender's are polite and show good manners. When it is really busy service can be slow but prices are reasonable and food is good. If you are close by stop in and check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and very attentive. So far, the Ruben is my favorite. All in all, a great sports bar/ grill."}
{"text":"It's usually a ghost town at the downtown Phoenix bars, but when a game and/or concert is happening, suddenly the bars are bustling. Such was the case last night at Majerle's, former Phoenix Suns player Dan Marjerle's sports bar. With the Beyonce concert across the street at the arena AND a D-backs game at the ball park, Phoenix was a hoppin'.

My friend and I stopped into Majerle's, which I've been to a few times before, for dinner and drinks before going to see Beyonce. I had a cheeseburger and Cesar Salad. While I realize it's hard to mess up a Cesar Salad, my salad was seriously the best Cesar I've ever had. And my burger was packed with flavor. No wonder AOL  named them Best Burgers two years in a row. We also had a wonderful chocolate martini (with Vanilla Vodka, not creme based) here. And on Fridays if you're in the mood to really start the night, the bar offers a Corona or Pacifico with a shot of tequila for $7 as part of their Sizzlin' Friday special.

My only complaint was that our waitress suddenly went M.I.A for about 15 minutes when we were trying to close our tab so we could go to the show.  But I'm still going to cut them some slack because this is one of a few fun places to drink in the downtown area.

HOT TIP: A second Majerle's will be opening in Chandler in the fall."}
{"text":"Not good for happy hour. A $7 beer????? Come on.

All there was at this joint was loud friends of the waitress sitting at the bar (they were talking about their previous nights activities) and how they started drinking at 2pm (it was 5)."}
{"text":"Eeewww!!! Skip this place!! The food is gross- no seasoning on anything!! I got a pasta dish - so bland and pointless to eat. My boyfriend got a burger that was way overcooked and the bun was too large to even eat with the meat! Garlic bread was way spicy (why I don't know... Wouldn't expect that to have a kick but my mouth was on fire). I got house wine to drink which seemed like it had been uncorked for a month so the next glass I upgraded which was a bad idea because I could only take a sip of because it was so gross. Never again!!"}
{"text":"6 of us Visited for Monday Night Football. Ordered Medium burgers that came out dry and well beyond medium. Wife ordered a wrap which didnt arrive until 20 minutes after everyone else was done eating. Manager was aware and never came over to visit. Waitress provided lame excuses. Only a small discount was given, wrap should have been comped. No need to ever visit again as our business was certainly not valued and the food and service was awful."}
{"text":"A very good sports bar - it is quite amazing just how many flat screen TV's they can cram on every wall. Also I was very impressed with their \"gorilla\" wings - you get 13 for $9 and have to say they are some of the meatiest wings I've had in a long time!"}
{"text":"I visited this location with a couple of friends and we all enjoyed our food.  It was nothing spectacular but nonetheless good.  Cinnamon was pretty cool though, was not overbearing yet was there when needed.  I would go back just due to cinnamon."}
{"text":"Excellent Hang out sports bar. My Mamas Burger was full of flavor and the very attractive Marie gave us excellent service. The atmosphere is a nice mix, with the patio and inside. Plenty of TVs and they broadcast the audio for the game.   

Fairly reasonable prices especially considering the service"}
{"text":"Good food, but the atmosphere is really loud even for a sports bar."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game must try the boneless tc wings they are amazing and so is there blue cheese definitely a must try and on happy hour they are on special"}
{"text":"The food is an absolute abortion of epic proportions. I'd honestly should've went to the Pizza Hut inside Target, at least it's cheap and it doesn't disappoint. Fuc this place and its proprietor!"}
{"text":"A colleague and I came early evening on a weekday, with no sporting events going on downtown, so it was not at all crowded. I had the jalapeño burger and the guy I was with had a different burger. We also had bbq wings and hot wings. 

The food was awesome and so was the service. 

This will be my go to spot when I am in town."}
{"text":"Food was cold and took over an hour to come out. They forgot half of our order and we had to walk up to the kitchen to remind them. AWFUL SERVICE - terrible place"}
{"text":"The place had a fun atmosphere,  friendly servers but the food is horrible here. Wings, fries, grilled cheese sandwich,  all just not good. You can tell the food here is an afterthought"}
{"text":"Every sports town should have a bar like this (just outside the arena). It's the first stop for conventioneers wandering into town (for a drink, post show). This ain't the place if you're looking for a quiet spot.. However, if you're looking for a lively and well furnished sports-bar, with attractive waitstaff, this place is great. The back room has huge leather booths. The outdoor seating is nice too--it can get a little wild after the events let loose."}
{"text":"I can not speak to the quality of the beer/drinks but as far as the food goes this is a serious thumbs DOWN. My first time visiting I was encouraged to get fish tacos by the bartender and a colleague. Nope, not good. Who puts cheddar cheese on fish tacos? That should have been my first warning. The fried fish was way nasty. I'm not even sure I can describe the horror.Second trip just today and I got the grilled chicken sandwich with bacon and avocado. Chicken was, dry,dry,dry!. Shoestring fries where not hot upon arrival. I went over lunch so it was a bit busy both times but come on. The water has a sanitize taste so maybe someone is going crazy on the sanitizer rinse. 1 star because the service was average. Third time will not be the charm. I'll pass on the next invitation to this place, that is for sure."}
{"text":"We live downtown and have been coming here on a regular basis since 2012. The service and food are pretty good, as are the prices. I especially like that they have burger substitute options... the turkey patty is amazing! Lots of TVs (for sports, or whatever), and good atmosphere on the weekend. A good neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"They do not have the same food at all locations, why? We were bait n switched last week when we went specifically for happy hour but were told happy hour was taken away for the comic con event across the street. The burger was great, I get it a lot. Servers were energetic and it was a nice hang out.

It's a nice location downtown. However desert ridge location is better in my opinion."}
{"text":"Love the decor. Staff is pretty good. They have the best chicken tacos around. The shredded chicken is tender and scrumptious."}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars because the food was delicious, our server was so sweet and accommodating. She always kept drinks coming and checked on us frequently. We moved to the bar afterward so as not to take up her table.  We were greeted by a bartender that was such a snob, i get it you have a bitch face but that does not entitle you to be one. She snarls as she takes our order. Demanding id which i couldn't find right away. She instantly assumes we were never carded and proceeds to tell the busser and other bartender. As i frantically dig for it she barks, who was your server. Ok whatever quarrel you have with your coworker does not involve me, why don't you focus on your customer. I finally find it and she ignores us the rest of our stay as if we ruined her chance to reprimand a server. Fucking awful bartender service. Period. Dot dot

Ps my Id was out of date dumbass"}
{"text":"I went to the Clippers' and Suns' game a few days ago in Phoenix (from California).  Since I am an NBA Lover, especially of the 90's, I had to see Thunder Dan's spot before the game.  I ordered the Sir Charles Chicken Sandwich, named after the Suns' legend...The food was good, just like anything you can get from a sit down restaurant and the service was great.  The waitress Leslie took good care of our group.  She knew we were visiting from California, so had some great recommendations for us.  I would come here again and I suggest you do.  Thunder Dan has a great spot; no wonder this place has been in business since 1992!!!!"}
{"text":"Thunder Dan... Get down here and teach your staff some hustle! Or maybe just some courtesy. A waitress (\"Cheeky\") seemed annoyed by our presence. Turns out she just wanted to chat to a group of her friends at the bar. When the place is this empty (past midnight), we can all see it happening, and it's rude. A party at the next table over came in and sat down, then left because no one came by. Yikes."}
{"text":"Server took almost 10 minutes to come to table then blamed it on hostess. Sunday evening, not busy. Ordered reuben. As far as Reubens go it was ok but they don't have slaw. Who doesn't have slaw with a reuben.  Also, no kosher pickle. In fact, no pickle. REALLY?"}
{"text":"Worst services/server I've ever experienced anywhere and I've been to some shitty ass places. Ordered and 40 minutes later we get the food and it's cold, plus no explanation from the server she just dropped the food off and left. Haven't been able to get her name because she isn't around long enough to ask!"}
{"text":"A few months back, my friends and I stopped by Majerle's on a birthday pub crawl.  It was a Saturday night, and was not really crowded, yet it was apparent that the two very young blonde bartenders were struggling to keep up.  

Although half the bar was empty, it took more than 20 minutes to get the bartender to take our order.  She made us repeat the order twice, and still failed to get it right.  It was a mixed drink, a beer, and a glass of water.  I was the one looking for the water; it was hot and I needed hydration.  Of course she brings everything over but the water, and as she turns to walk away I try several times to stop her, with seemingly offensive terms as \"Excuse me,\" and \"Miss.\"  While she continues to ignore me, I throw my arm up in the air, waving my hand, still trying to get her attention.  Finally I start snapping, which instantly gets a response.  I ask her, nicely (even though I'm seriously annoyed at this point) if she could please get me a glass of water.  You should've have seen the look this girl gave me...straight out daggers.  She pours my water, slams it on the bar and says\" DON'T EVER SNAP AT ME AGAIN!\"  turns around, and storms off.  I was so stunned, I actually was speechless for a solid minute, and anyone who knows me, would know rendering me speechless is quite the feat.  Apparently I have a lot of nerve asking for the water SHE forgot to bring in the first place.  

I drank my water and we promptly left.  With attitude and service like that, I don't know how this place will survive, but best of luck to you.  I'll be busy visiting the surrounding bars where I can actually get a drink, sans the ridiculously bitchy attitude."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Drinks were made incorrectly and the food wasn't that good. Walk across the street and go to hi fi or whiskey row"}
{"text":"Majerle's Sports Grill is perhaps one of the best sports' themed bars to go to in the valley. Yes, I know one must be confident to utter such words, but just take my word for it.

Call me biased - being an NBA fan, both of the Phoenix Suns and Thunder Dan (umm, owner of the restaraunt), the environment is awesome. The place is literally packed for every weekly events, from NBA, NFL, NCAA games, to major pay-per view events such as UFC. As you can imagine it can get quite loud at times, but I dining with good food, live sports, and interesting people is more than one could bargain for...

As for the food itself, I have tried many items off the menu, and you can bet the food is great. Burgers, salads, and sanwiches are all recommended here. I strongly recommend the fries. The waitresses are another highlight as this has to be one of the best establishments I have gone to without any \"Waitress Incidents\". 

So what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Wait staff needs to pay attention to their customers and less watching the games.  Waited 10 minutes and until I finally flagged someone down to order. 
It seems this sports bar is losing customers, not very busy for Sunday football. Maybe the service?"}
{"text":"i had a great time here; waitresses/service was good- no complaints! i had a burger which tasted straight from a grill n homemade, wasnt a fan of the stringy fries tho, loud music that might bust ur ears if u heard it long enuf,... thr are lots of tvs to enjoy any game on :) all in all i wud come here another time... too bad i didnt see thunder dan"}
{"text":"4 stars only for the Happy hour experience. Awesome service from the front door to the bar...yay!  Generous happy hour food menu and yummers on the Cocktail specials.  Watch ANY game you can imagine on all the Tv's. Plus it is kind of a sausage fest for us women...just saying :)"}
{"text":"Service was Excellent ... food was OK and a bit pricey.

Jamie D. and Madison did a great job from a service perspective!  

As for the food, the mozzarella sticks were not the greatest, and were pricey for what I got.  The  burgers are large, but the one I got had little flavor and was a bit on the dry side.  Expect an upcharge if getting anything other than fries with your burger.

Plenty of TVs if you are going to watch a game, and even have plenty of games on from other regions."}
{"text":"I went last night to Majerle's to watch the UFC fight. It was one of the few places that I thought wouldn't be packed to watch the fights. There were not alot of people there so it was an ideal environment to watch the UFC. However, the first thing I noticed is that it feels more like a lounge than a sports bar. The clientele is a mixture of people expecting a lounge experience with people expecting a sports bar. Confused identity? 

Food and Menu: The menu is probably one of the worst menus I have ever tried to order from. It was an expensive menu that lacked creativity or anything that seemed original or unique. Can't justify the cost when many sports bars offer more for less. I ordered an appetizer, Potato skins. Can't screw that up, right? No they did. The skins were tough and dried out It tasted microwaved. The portion was almost half the size of most sports bars and twice the price. I then ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich and a friend ordered a veggie burger. Both were horrible. The veggie burger tasted too much like meet. It tasted like it was grilled with the other burgers. The Cajun chicken was nowhere near Cajun anything. 1 star.

Service: When we arrived we had a waitress who was attentive and also noticed that we were unhappy with the food. She did a great job. Then she told us she was being told to go home and introduced us to our new waitress. We cashed out to allow her to get the tip she greatly deserved. We were there 2 hours after wards and the new waitress only asked us once about a refill. This would have originally been 5 stars for service but easily ended at 2.5 stars. 

The good thing about Majerle's is that minus the service, food, and cost it is a great place to watch sports. It is nice how the tvs are placed and the variety of sports shown. I was able to keep an eye on the Stanford game while watching the UFC fights. However, if I wanted a place only for the TV I'd stay home. I forced myself into 2 stars."}
{"text":"I like this place. I don't get there often, but it's a nice place to hangout to watch sports."}
{"text":"Was excited to go to this place when I was in town because I grew up watching Dan Majerle in the 90's.  I liked all the old Suns references on the menu and on the walls.  Food was pretty typical for a big sports bar.  Good to place to chill and have a beer."}
{"text":"My husband and I were there tonight when they were showing  a UFC fight. We had been there for 2 hours before it started. The bartenders were great but asked if we were staying for the fight. We said no. Then the fight started but we had planned on having dinner and more drinks. We had no interest in the fight. The bartender then asked again-are you staying for the fight? I said-why? She said it's a $20 cover per person to stay. I said-well, then no. Cancel our food order. Talked to the manager and told him the story and he said-sorry, we do this once every 2 months and that's how it is. Pointed out to him that no one was waiting to get in. He didn't care. And as we left, so did 10 others. Bad business.... You never let people leave your bar when they're spending money. Been there several times but will never go back after this experience"}
{"text":"Great sports bar atmosphere. Great service, burger was delicious, and the cookie dessert was to die for. Choose this place!"}
{"text":"Everything was great except for the tap water...order a bottle water if you are a water drinker. Food was excellent and full of flavor!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced tasteless food with a poor beer selection. It doesn't quite fall flat on its face just based on the fact I didn't get sick and the atmosphere was OK. The service was OK too, but it wasn't busy at all. 
There are like 50 TV's in here, so I imagine if you like a bud light and a bar to sit around and watch whatever sports there is going on, then it is the place for you. Just don't order the food."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic.  Love the buffalo chicken wrap.  Service is great.  Bar staff smokin' hot.  Manager/Partner is actually Dan Majerle's brother, could pass as his twin, and is a really engaging guy.  When the person running the bar is happy to be there, it's an infectious attitude that has a positive impact on the staff.  They have an employee dedicated to the plasmas to ensure all the top games are on.  And it helps that they're partial to my Sun Devils, while catering to transplants.  Overall, Majerle's is a great sports bar with a fantastic staff and fantastic menu.  

I just wish they could find a way to keep it busy and stay open late because Tonic across the street is the only nearby option after the sporting events conclude."}
{"text":"Always get the Mama Majerle Burger, NEVER disappointed, service epic! My wife loves the Gorilla Wings (extra hot). Being a  connoisseur this is a favorite of mine no matter what location we eat at the Mama Majerle Burger is consistent with the amazing sweet bun (that melts in ur mouth) and the cheese always is melted perfect! I will return!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice, laid back bar. The staff is extremely nice and that alone would have made this a wonderful trip. I had a few liquid marijuana shots and an order of their cheese fries. Both were good."}
{"text":"It is pretty loud in here, but other than that I like the food. The chicken sandwich and the fries are great."}
{"text":"The food is good, but don't go on an \"event day\". They have an event day menu that features a smaller selection yet they bump the prices up on everything. I mean, $24 for potato skins and ice tea (that includes a $4 tip, I figure it wasn't the help's fault)."}
{"text":"Not bad. Came here for happy hour before the Dbacks game, where Majerle's is ideally situated a few blocks away. Got wicked strong margaritas and some decent, although not memorable appetizers, all at a very reasonable price. Beer menu was slightly lacking in my opinion. Service was attentive and friendly too, and good outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Update: the food has gone down a bit since my last visit. I ordered my burger \"medium\" but I still got a dry hockey puck. The fries arrived cold and bland and the soda was flat. At least the Buffalo Chicken Pizza is still on point and the service was good. 

However, the worst part of dinner was not the food....

It was the lousy DJ known as DJ Ray Ray... he screwed up every song he played with terrible \"scratchin'\" that was ridiculously off tempo and inappropriate for the music selections. The volume had a wide disparity between selections. One song would be at a low volume and the next would be so loud your ears would bleed. This so-called DJ must be a friend of the manager because he is that bad.... we couldn't enjoy a conversation without having to yell over the racket of bad scratching (mind you, I grew up on ol' Skool rap, funk and R&B..... Roger, Michael and Tupac are rolling over in their graves from what \"DJ Okie Doke\" has done to their music.

Normally I would stay after dinner and have drinks with my friends, but this crappy DJ made that impossible. 

I will give the venue another shot, but not as long as \"DJ Tone Deaf\" is there."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch at Majerle's yesterday. Fast service. Immediate seating. Friendly and attentive staff. I had the jalapeño burger. It was very tasty but has a bit too much bun. I asked for medium on the burger and was made well done. Still very good. Loved the fried jalapeños and Chipotle mayo. Not a big fan of the stringy fries though."}
{"text":"Majerles is a great place to watch a game.  I primarily go Tuesdays for Thunder Trivia and sit in Ines' section.  She is one of the best servers I've had.  Then I go Friday and Sundays and see Jen at the bar.  Both make my time at Majerles every time I go there.  The food is good, the housemade drinks are delicious, and the happy hour prices are unbeatable!  Not to mention, there are televisions everywhere and they will put on any game you need/want to watch."}
{"text":"Very limited menu, and nasty food. I had a grilled chicken breast sandwich, the chicken was tough, and had too much tendons and fat in it. My friend had a pasta dish with chicken in it, I kid you not, she could only find two or three small little cubes of chicken in the entire pasta bowl. Way overpriced, even if the food was better.  But when you're paying this much for crappy food, you feel ripped off.  Maybe this place will do fine selling just drinks, but nobody in their right mind would go back here for the food.  Yuk!"}
{"text":"Chelsea (name on ticket 8/17) was amazing!! Super sweet, attentive & friendly. Definitely knows what she's doing (I've been a server for years lol). I'd love to have her as a server again. Fiancé and I both acknowledged how great she was. 

We ordered wings, mozzarella sticks, & cheeseburger sliders and they were all delicious!! I also ordered a few margs (love the frozen). 

Manager (we think?) was also walking around and it was apparent that he was involved and making sure the guests were being taken care of.

We love majerles!! This location is so nice and classy, we will for sure be back"}
{"text":"Good food.  I had the Rojo Diablo chicken sandwich.  The wing sauce has a good kick.  The fries left some to be desired.  They're the smaller cut variety like those served at Steak and Shake.  On the side I was given a small cup of ranch.  Even that was good.  Not cheap watery stuff like I've been served at other places.

One pitfall to my visit was service.  It was slow despite an abundance of waitress' and not many customers.  It was Sunday morning prior to kickoff and the place was just beginning to fill up.  To make matters worse a different waitress assisted every step of the way: one took my order, one brought the food, another went for my refills.  My friend had to ask two different girls for our check.

Had I not been occupied with a game I would have been annoyed at the service quality and wait.  

Majerle's should also take a look at their satellite boxes.  Two or three of their screens were frozen.  Not a good thing to have happen when folks come in to watch games.  One tv was frozen the entire duration of our stay.  Other places I've been to are always on top of malfunctions.  If you can't get one game to come in then change it to another.

Go for the food, not to watch games."}
{"text":"I understand that it's a sports grill, but it was so dark that I couldn't even read my menu.  Thank goodness there was an enormous TV hanging over my head so I could hold the menu up to its flickering blue light.  And don't go if you want to actually hear what your meal-mates are saying.  We were in an out of the way spot, and still had trouble hearing what was being said at the other end of the table.  At some point I think we just stopped trying to converse and started shouting and making hand gestures at each other.  A knowledge of sign language would have come in handy here.

I love Ruben sandwiches.  I try them almost every place I go to that serves them.  The one I got at Majerle's was not good.  Not good at all.  I've had hundreds of Rubens, and this one had some very weird, off-tasting spice in it that should not EVER be in a Ruben.  I still can't put my finger on what it was, but I've never tasted it in a Ruben sandwich before and hope I never do again.

The soda I ordered tasted like all carbonation and not much syrup.  Reminded me of Alka-Seltzer.

I would have given it one star, but the sweet potato fries were pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great atmosphere, cheap prices on drinks and food, and really tasty bar food. The cotton club room is the best!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the drinks were weak and seemed overpriced for what you get. I had to order extra to compensate for the weak drinks. The manager couldn't even take the time to come to the table to listen to concerns."}
{"text":"Went there last Friday for Happy Hour since we always go to Ef Hefe for football games on Sunday's...  This place blew our socks off in comparison to Ef Hefe.  First off the bartender introduces himself and shakes out hand - nice Jesse.  They had pretty fair happy hour prices and selection of food; we had wings and chicken fingers - both good but the string fries were the best : )  The bartender was very attentive and friendly chat, something that never happens next door.  Now I can see why this place is packed on Sundays especially if you are a Cardinals fan.    Cheers to Jesse for the great service."}
{"text":"Came in to watch the first game of the season....fun right....WRONG!! Sat at the bar with a friend and the bartender (Tara) was clearly overwhelmed and not able to manage the light flow of the customers....she didn't make an effort to acknowledge us when we sat down or even give pleasantries as she did take our orders....they even charge you an extra $1 to get a drink on the rocks :-/ 

The bar hand (Chris) was however wonderful....he made sure that we at least got our order put in and even helped out a friend for an outlet to charge her phone...

They should have more than one bartender or one that can handle the crowd better.....

However, the tempura shrimp was good!!! So for Chris and the shrimp 2 stars...."}
{"text":"Great prices for drinks and food! Definitely a place to stop by on Sunday Fun Day if your in Old Town. Definitely try the buffalo wings and fries...but ask to make them extra crispy haha."}
{"text":"Awesome sports bar- and this coming from a girl who doesn't even like sports! Came here before a D-back game, and on a couple of Pub Crawls. Each time, the place was packed, yet each time, still got excellent service. Very friendly waitress and bartenders. Drinks came fast and good times were had. Decent menu, similar to other sports bars, lots of burgers and wings. Great choice when your downtown."}
{"text":"Your standard sports bar fare, reasonably priced and served with a smile.  Good for a beer and a sandwich while watching a game."}
{"text":"Bar comfort food which is usually very good. Fish & shrimp tacos are delicious! No complaints with the sandwich selection (the French Dip is awesome!) appetizers are healthy-sized potions.

Plenty of TV sets all over the restaurant so you can pretty much catch any game on. Only drawback is limited beer selection. At least at this location. Other locations seem to have expanded their draft choices but not here and the half empty bar and restaurant may reflect that. Personally, I'm Ubering over to a competitor to catch the next game and enjoy a better draft selection. Blue Moon just doesn't cut it!

Finally, it's very annoying to have music played during the games. Probably a licensing issue but most sports bars find a way to not annoy customers with obnoxious music being played instead of commercials. Add a DJ in the patio to the mix and your game is ruined. So I'd skip his place if you are intent on watching a game as it was meant to be seen.. good beer in hand and commercials during breaks!"}
{"text":"Wow, this is very disappointing, when you spend $10-12 per meal, you expect more than canned nacho cheese and frozen fish sticks. Time to step up your game."}
{"text":"Food is less than average. If you just want to watch a game and have a drink, it's fine. Though most cases you won't be able to listen to your game you'll only see it."}
{"text":"Lots of fun. Great service and fun staff. Rather limited menu, but great happy hour specials. We go every weekend."}
{"text":"We had a great experience! Went for lunch on a Saturday. My wife had the club sandwich and I a pico burger cooked mr. Both were wonderful, fresh and tasty. Crystal our bartender/server was very attentive, not to mention, a cutie.  very nice facility, would like to come here with friends on a weekend night for a game and fun!"}
{"text":"Good drinks. Not sure on food. We only had an appetizer. Chili fries were ok. Beer and service was great!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere- quick walk from downtown and a great place to watch basketball playoffs with friends. It wasn't too dark or too loud in there that you couldn't hold a conversation. We sat at the bar and food came out relatively quick. I got the Majerle's chicken tacos- 3 of them with lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and pico. Perfect size and the chips & salsa were a nice addition. All for $10.83 with tax (although the prices might've increased a little since then). A few others in our group had also gotten some form of tacos and all remarked that they were very good"}
{"text":"Came here because Cooperstown was closed. Got a seat quick, sat for 20 minutes and not 1 damn waitress, with 2 or 3 walking around, came to our table. We just got up and left. For a place supposedly owned by a former Phoenix Sun, it lacks to impress... would rate it no stars if I could."}
{"text":"My Partner and I flew into Phoenix last week for the Christmas Holiday and we stopped here for lunch before heading out to the family.    I was fairly impressed with the cuisine and the ambiance.

I had a burger with all the trimmings and it was prepared perfectly.  I would have liked a few more fries with the burger, but I probably didn't need them.

I have to say the 80's hair band music videos playing were a little weird though.

If I find myself back in Phoenix, I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Pretty decent sports bar.  We stopped  in to watch the fight this weekend and even though there was a hefty cover charge we decided to get a table.  The night turned out to be pretty pricey but we enjoyed ourselves.  Food was ok we enjoyed the sliders and nachos were just meh.  Our drinks were great and our server was busy but kept  everyone happy.  We were seated in a weird section called the Cotton Club? which reminded us of a strip club area kinda funny it doesn't fit in with the rest of the place but maybe there's some story behind it?  Anyway glad we stopped in."}
{"text":"Majerle's serves the best bacon cheddar burger I have ever had.  Crispy on the outside and pink inside.  And their shoestring fries are crispy and delicious.  The servers are great.  And I have their 15% discount card which includes a free lunch at the end.  It is a sports bar and has TV's all around featuring various games and a music channel as well.  I go primarily to the one at Desert Ridge outdoor mall, as well as the original downtown when attending ball games at either Chase Field or Talking Stick Arena or the one in Old Scottsdale (which is unfortunately off the beaten path and harder to find).  I highly recommend Dan's restaurants."}
{"text":"Had a great time with the Schmooze crew. Non profit discussions over dinner and drinks. Great food, company and customer service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Solid, good time! Grab a beer and bar food and it's a good night"}
{"text":"Me and my wife go to Majerle's often we have always found it to be a great place, a little pricy sometimes,  but we like the great service and atmosphere.    It has very good food,  lots of great sports on the many Flat Screens.   Its a good dependable place to go.   And Dan Majerle's brother that runs the place is a nice guy and always will have a word with ya if you try.   We like to sit at the bar which could have been a little bigger.  But what do I know.    I'll take it the way it is."}
{"text":"Pretty chill place. Good views of tv's. Likely to recommend to watch a good game. Go Avs!"}
{"text":"It's a very nice place, good menu and prices, and the quality of the food is above average.

Where this restaurant excels is in customer service where the hostess makes you feel welcome, the managers are always asking how things are, and the bartenders are very personable - especially Marissa and Jordan.  These two have given me great food recommendations to go with my beer, and that is always appreciated.

Parking is not the best and the lighting could be a little better but other than that, I always have a great time here."}
{"text":"I like this place quite a bit. Good food and good people. Bar staff is on point and  DJ Klassik keeps the energy right. Will definitely make this my go to spot"}
{"text":"Popped in for dinner on a Sunday night when not much was open in DT Phoenix.  The food itself was fine, nothing to write home about.  Decent beer selection and friendly helpful staff made up for it."}
{"text":"Been to the Majerle's in Phoenix, but this review is for the new place in Chandler - as I can't remember the last time I visited the downtown estab.  The bottom line.  Avoid like the plague.  A couple observations:
- The place was total sausage fest.  Like 20 dudes to one girl.  During happy hour.
- Worst fish and chips imaginable.  Now what place on earth serves up cookie-encrusted grease-soaked cod with sugar-laced french fries???  Yuck.
- The tartar sauce to go with that?  Nope.  Just all mayo.
- Hot wings, surprisingly, we're okay.
- Philly cheesesteak sandwich - ick.
- Cole slaw, more like sugar slaw.

Place blows.  So many other great places in the East Valley to visit with your hard earned dollar.  Vote elsewhere."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch. I had mama majerle burger. It was very good. Fries were good too. My gf had the Reuben with sweet fries. Both tasty as well. Our server Hailey was friendly and attentive. We had a great overall expirence and will be back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years for lunch, dinner, Birthdays and other celebrations. Family friendly with great food...UNTIL NOW!  Ordered gorilla wings last night and got \"chimp\" wings instead. Staff says management changed the wing style and supplier recently. Now they are smaller with less meat.  My kid's French fries were hard also. Staff was very nice and accommodating but we come here for the good food.  Not big on drinking. So now we need to find new place for good wings.  #Bummed"}
{"text":"Went for a couple of drinks during happy hour. Half priced appetizers and drinks specials. I get a $50.75 bill. The bill states gratuity of 20% was included and with this party of 10 people... Yes, we split Bill'S and kept our own.  I can understand the 20% gratuity.  What I don't understand is the math! $50.75 x 20% = $10.15........total should = $61.00 
Yet my bill was total $72.17
Called manager over, MAJERLY's brother...he states...\"gratuity is charged based on full price of drinks and appetizers.\"  Which is not \"BASED ON THE BILL.\"     I would have been happy paying this tip but the shitty service I had wasn't worth it! In other words...\"MAJERLY's ripps people off\" on the gratuity!!!!  Tv's are great."}
{"text":"Food was pretty okey. The fish tacos which I had were nothing too special. At least is was edible. Their drink choices were a mess and the menu was a disaster."}
{"text":"Been here several times and it's a solid sports bar with good bar food.  Service is good and the staff is friendly.  Great place to catch a game on their many large screen TV's.  Close to work, so it's convenient and close."}
{"text":"By far the worst marjerles in the valley. Not only was the service horrible the food was cold. The waitress was unfriendly and disengaging. They have very limited beer selections and it took so long for our food to come out that every one of our plates was cold. I will never go back to this location again. Worst marjerles experience ever."}
{"text":"danielle was our waitress tonight and she was wonderful. we were from out of town and explain the troubles of the bars/clubs to get in. she was super nice and took care of us, i hope her manager reads this and gives her a raise of our welcoming her present was. the djs was also great music and bought drink in appreciation. will be returning before i leave town."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner between shows, mainly because we could watch some football. This place turned out to be a great find! The service was friendly and spot-on.  The food was excellent! 

I had the chicken tacos. The flour tortillas were fresh and delicious. The chicken was perfectly grilled and flavored. The home-made salsa was PERFECT! 

I enjoy visiting Phoenix, and this place is on my list to come back to every time!"}
{"text":"The boneless wings, medium sauce are the outstanding!"}
{"text":"This is your run-of-the-mill sports bar that caters to the not-so-blue-collar 30something crowd of Chandler.  The ambiance is nice, darker, big screen TVs everywhere... the waitresses are attractive (a staple at these types of places) and they are friendly and attentive... ours was on this very day.  

It's Beer Week in AZ this week and they had just hosted a SanTan event (pub crawl) today as part of Beer Week, so they were understandably out of SanTan Devil's Ale and the place was quite quiet when we arrived at 5pm. We got seated at the patio where the have a nice little Bocce ball area and it was nice to enjoy the great Phx February weather.

Alright, so we ordered burgers as we were both in the mood for a sizable piece of beef, hopefully topped with bacon and other yummies.  They did a pretty good job for being a sports bar, but not impressive. They claim their meat is fresh ground, though when that's the case, the patty has a different type of form and is less flat and compacted.. okay, maybe they grind it in the AM and then stockpile patties for the day.. that's fine.  The bacon (I ordered the #9 All Star - cheddar, bacon, beef) was lame... thin, a bit stale-tasting, and not crispy.  The cheese was fine.  I did like that the meat was char-broiled and so it has a good taste to it.  Also, the inside wasn't over cooked and the bread they served it on was kinda sweet and giant... tasty, actually.

The sides were blaaaah.. cole slaw was really boring and had literally 3 ingredients (white cabbage, carrots, sugary mayo) something I would expect from Chili's or Denny's.

Well, the burger hit the spot but the rest was plain and boring.  The Stella was not as cold as I prefer.  Our staff was very good.  So far, an OK place to visit, but a 4 star place is somewhere I will likely go out of my way to visit.. this didn't make the cut."}
{"text":"Horrible. Just horrible. Bartenders are rude. They dont greet. Ended up leaving after not getting our food for 30-40 minutes. The places wasnt even packed. Knowing this place gets busy after games this place should be more fun to be at... 

Theres one star because Yelp wouldnt let me continue."}
{"text":"So i would have rated this higher except I found that a bar/gtill having a kids birthday there was too of for me. 
 The service was ok nothing special...
However the fries! So good.  Shoestring crisp deliciousness. 
I had a salad it was tasty... Cobb if i recall correctly."}
{"text":"The old town, nightclub area of Scottsdale needed a sports bar/restaurant and Majerle's fills the bill. Food is good, prices are reasonable, and flatscreens are everywhere so you can watch any game that's on. I'm sure it gets crowded at night, but for a lunch spot its not too bad.

Oh, and like almost everywhere in Scottsdale, the serving staff is very attractive, but don't be that creepy old guy who moves to a different seat at the bar to get a better view of the bartender bending over in her tight shorts (yeah, I heard you dude... and so did she)!"}
{"text":"Great service, okay drinks, bad food. It's not fresh, homemade, or exciting. It's bland, and tastes similar to cafeteria or fast food. My fiancé had the \"Stash's Spicy Sicilian\" and it tasted like a frozen \"Freschetta\" pizza, seriously... took me back to high school. I had the \"Burns & Gambo Basic Burger\", and it was definitely basic. I ordered it medium, but I ate an under seasoned, well done burger. The sweet potato fries I had with it tasted like they were made from a bag out of a college kids freezer.  What ever happened to real, homemade, fresh, and flavorful food? When I go out to dinner, I don't want to eat frozen store bought crap I would of thrown together when I was a kid. On a side note, they do have a lot of TV's and will put on any game per request, which is a plus."}
{"text":"Kids meal was $6.50 for 2 sliders and the smallest amount of fries I have ever seen in my life!  Seriously.....is there a potato shortage??

Club sandwich was $12.50 and it was just meh!

Way too pricey for bar food.  There are too many places in Desert Ridge and City North that are a better value overall.  

Service was good, but that is not what will make me come back again.  Sorry, I won't be going back until prices go down OR food quality goes up."}
{"text":"Great service, food was outstanding from the bbq pizza, outstanding wings, chicken pasta and an outstanding burger"}
{"text":"Meh...been twice now. First time not bad. Greek salad flavorful though chicken was chewy. Chicken selections seem to be tough. Cannot cut it or chew it. My daughter had the gorilla wings that she found tough as well. I'm on a grain free diet. I asked if the Cajun chicken had a coating or breading of any kind. The waitress said it was blackened, no flour. When I got it, it seemed to have a cornmeal base with the blackened seasoning, in addition to being tough. Maybe the burgers are the way to go. In any event, not very impressed."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Majerles and I was disappointed because I was meeting a friend from out of town after work and we were looking for a place with a good happy hour...this was not it. I called them to check to see if they have a happy hour before going and the person I talked too said it went until 7 pm and included a whole list of things $6 apps and $3 beers. When we got there we asked if we had to sit at bar for happy hour and they said no. We sit down and ask what the happy hour is again and the waitress says we have $5 long islands...I was waiting for her to give us the rest and we got nothing from her...I asked any beers? No not right now...okay. Get our beers at regular price and then when it's time to order I ask what food is on your happy hour...nothing right now. Wth!? The staff needs to be better prepared and knowledgeable of menu and specials. We specifically went here for a happy hour and their wasn't even one! I wish we went to Zipps.

The only reason I am giving this review 2 stars is because the Mama Majerles Burger was good."}
{"text":"Majerle's serves a wicked reuben: that melted swiss, sauerkraut, and thinly sliced corned beef gets you to that point where you food coma out after your lunch break and make for a very unproductive end of the workday in downtown Phoenix.  Go Warriors!!!"}
{"text":"The manager, a younger white girl asked me to move out of her way tonight. I looked behind me and there was plenty of room for her to go around me as I was pressed up against the bar already. I am the DD tonight so I was clear with her that she could go around me. She looked at me and then told the staff that I had to be removed from the bar. They kicked me out after my friends have have spent hundreds of dollars tonight and tipped very well. That manager is clearly using her power to do what she wants to any one she wants. Clearly not management material. I own a business and I would never want someone like her managing anything for me."}
{"text":"$8 for a well vodka/tonic at Majerle's? Are you serious? 

I haven't paid that much for a well drink except for fancy resorts and pricey bars in LA or NYC.  That drink and a tall Blue Moon last night came out to a ludicrous $16 before tip. Perhaps this is special highway robbery pricing for unsuspecting NBA All Star visitors?!

TVs are awkwardly placed, but the exposed brick lends a time-worn atmosphere to this cozy sports bar.  $16 just isn't worth it though. Too many other bars in the vicinity to waste your time."}
{"text":"The strawberry and feta salad is superb! Great blood Mary and an extremely attentive and friendly bartender. I stopped in Friday afternoon for a quick lunch. Good times!"}
{"text":"We went here yesterday before the baseball game for lunch. I had a bacon burger, my mom had a french dip, my step dad a reuben and my daughter a cheese crisp. I also substituted my fries for cheese fries. 

Positive: the bacon on my burger was AMAZING!!!, the fries were crisp fresh hot and they gave you a lot of them, the staff was super nice, we could sit where ever we wanted (but there wasn't many people there yet), they had a good variety of things on their menu and drink menu, they had pretty good drinks specials. the au jus for the french dip was tasty, my step dad recommends the reuben and my mom agreed (I didn't taste it because I dont eat sauerkraut) 

Negative: the cheese fries stunk... I think it was the cheese they used (a kind of cheddar) but I wished I had just got regular fries after they came, the cheese crisp was over cooked and cold, my mom did not like the sandwich part of her french dip (just too boring and she even added mushrooms and onions), and the prices were well kind of over priced (I didn't think my burger was worth 9 bucks) 

It was good, but I think I would only go back to drink alcohol."}
{"text":"While food is not bad and service is acceptable, the place is over priced.

Don't bother making reservations either.  The manager will take the reservation then when you arrive, inform you they cannot honor it.   Of course by then it is too late."}
{"text":"For so-so food, it is way overpriced.  Definitely not a place to have more than a beer or two at their prices.  Service is acceptable though.

They claim they accept reservations, but fail to write them down anywhere.  They regularly overbook and those who show up early are fine, those who come on time, well, too bad."}
{"text":"We visited Majerle's to kill some traffic time leaving downtown. I came with no expectations and only wanted a drink and some downtime to cap off the evening. Well, this was accomplished! And well might I add. 

We sat at the bar, were greeted prompty and served politely. Both bartenders were personable and efficient. The crowd around seemed upbeat, business casual and relaxed. Decent, though not overly crowded scene for a Saturday night. 

The menu looked diverse and varied drinks available. Decor was clean, modern, and comforting. Prices were on par for the area and venue. 

Really not a ton I can comment on as it was one drink (It really was, too!). No, not \"two\", TOO! 

Seems like a nice place to relax when downtown. Would I drive here just for Majerle's? Nope. Would I pop in if downtown wanting a drink or some food? For sure."}
{"text":"We love this place!!! The food and Service were great.  Nicole at the Avondale location is the best!!! We love her."}
{"text":"+ 35 minute wait was 10 minutes
+ Waitress was really friendly 
+ Exposed brick!
-  A little on the small side...even with the back room its small for a sports bar  (This seems to be an ongoing thing here...cram as many tables as possible into once place leaving no standing room)
+ There were 4 huge LCD tvs within 10 feet in each direction
- They were clearly showing a stretched out non-HD broadcast
+ Sam Adams on tap
- Sam Adams is an \"import\" and $4.50 a pint, not $3.00 like \"domestic\"  (Boston is that much further than St Louis or Milwaukee?)
+ The place emptied out when the Suns game started
+ They kept playoff football on the TVs even though there was a Suns game going on simultaneously
Weird - The Suns game was on the TVs in the bathroom
- The \"medium\" burger came out completely disgustingly charred
- The bun was HUGE and the burger itself was meager - for $9 you expect at least a 1/3 or 1/2lb juicy burger, not a charred Happy Meal sized patty.
- I don't understand bacon in Phoenix, this is the second time it's been so totally overcooked it's brittle and hurts to bite into
- \"Rum and cokes\" turned into \"Captain and cokes\"

In summation I would say that it's a good place to go for a drink and watch a game but get dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to any Marjele's. They have good drinks as well as good food which is something you can't say about every bar.

They also have various locations so if this Marjele's doesn't suit your taste, another might will. This Marjele's is smaller so if you don't want to be bombarded by an obnoxious crowded bar where you can barely move around then this must be your lucky day!

If you come for happy hour be prepared to pay for parking unless you're coming by another means or you know a secret free spot before the meters are free.

I always enjoy the music at Marjele's and of course whatever game is on.  Marjele's has a nice vibe so if you haven't been or  you're looking for your next bar, you should definitely give Marjele's a shot ;)"}
{"text":"Crazy as it sounds, I LOVE the chicken teriyaki bowl!"}
{"text":"Majerle is the cheapest restaurant owner in town. Thought I would give the real food a chance and was in the mood for a burger, but not in the mood for a frozen patty that they get delivered once a week (bartender admission). Cmon Dan, really, does this make you happy. We know you are just in it for the profit and don't care about the food.  At least upgrade your burgers, but I realize that the drunken Dbags don't care what they are shoving down their throat, but some folks care. They are still a nice staff and will turn on any games you want, but I will never be eating there."}
{"text":"I will not be back. Turkey chili on rice was dry, over spiced and was not chili. Wings were ok. My burger was ok. As a sports bar yes, go and watch sports and have a drink. It is great for that. Plenty of TV screens. But as for food....eat before you go."}
{"text":"First time odering delivery

Last time ordering delivery 

Pros: Food came relatively quickly.  Temp was warm...ish.  The eggrolls were not bad, got greasy from being cold. The sandwich though...omg...the sandwich.   AWFUL!!!

They put the round outside on the inside with a teeny smear of mustard (thanks guys ).  Did i mention the bun was wrong side out?!! On both sides!  Who does that except to be intentionally mean?!

Cons:  i am not returning.  Bun gate made that clear.  Take pride in your work people"}
{"text":"Very friendly bartenders and hostess. 
Attentive to everything we needed, not asking too much either. They did their jobs well and me and my buddy really appreciated the quality service."}
{"text":"The service was ok. She didn't check on refills. The table was a little dirty when they sat us. The menu is kinda bad, they need more of a selection!! The roll they use for the burgers are awful! Who wants a roll bigger than their burger? They have really gone down hill."}
{"text":"Rated high on sports and cold drinks. Falls a bit average on the food. It's not bad, but I come for the sports and environment. Food is a full on afterthought. 

Sorry the review is short. Not much else to say."}
{"text":"Stopped by with my wife for a quick drink and appetizer during happy hour. Worst nachos I've ever had, basically about 25 chips in a basket with a bunch of jalapeños. They brought my wife's white wine in a warm glass. The prices for a happy hour are a joke except for beer and a house margarita. Will never stop here again. There are so many better options."}
{"text":"Had an excellent burger that was served to me quickly. Manager was very nice when he stopped to check in on my meal, I think his name was Juan. I will come back to this location in the future."}
{"text":"We like this place to watch games and when we lived close, we went here about once a month. We have tried most of the appetizers and a few of the entrees, such as the French dip and the strawberry fields salad. Both entrees were nothing special but a few of the apps we have liked a lot-gorilla wings (non-breaded, white meat, boneless chicken in yummy sauce) and used to really like the cheeseburger sliders until they seemingly changed the rolls. 

The ambiance is clean and classy and there are screens visible from every seat for big games. Kid friendly during the day but at night, the crowd is definitely adult, as are the music and music videos they play on the TV. There is comfortable lounge seating (and regular tables/booths, too)  and outdoor seating with a fireplace. Service is always friendly but sometimes hard to track then down for refills or the check, a bill which adds up really quickly here. With so many sports bars near us in Mesa, not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Sports bar with sports food and sports beer. They show music videos, though, which is...neat? We had two servers - one was great, the other was very mad that we wanted to order our drinks before happy hour ended."}
{"text":"Food: huge chicken strips for kids! My 3 year old and 1 year old split the order and couldn't finish. Fries were amazing to me, oily to my husband. Burger had no seasoning and tasted like pure cow. Couldn't finish it. Bun also tasted like a potato bread base which made it squishy and chewy. 

Service: fine until we got our food and then she disappeared. No refills. Not enough napkins. No check back on food quality. Once we saw her again we let her know my husband couldn't eat his salad, that our drinks were empty, and asked for garlic bread and the check. It took ten minutes for her to come back with the check and the manager brought the bread out, we told him we had to leave because our daughter needed to sleep, and he boxed it up for us. $37 for the girls to eat, and us to munch on fries.

Environment: awesome.

Probably won't come back unless a group is coming and invites us."}
{"text":"I was super excited when Majerle's had came to Old Town just blcoks away from my place.  Its a great place to walk to and get drinks or get some food.  I had never eaten at a Majerle's before it came here, but I heard good things.  They did not disapoint.  I have been there several times now and liked everything.  My favs are the buffalo chicken pizza and this one chicken sandwich with the sprouts and bacon... I forget what the name is.  Good atmosphere.  I am surprised it is not more busy.  Everytime I go there are always plenty of open tables.  I hope this place does well.  I will continue to go here."}
{"text":"I'm not really fond of writing sub par reviews. I really covet being wowed, I like being pleasantly surprised, and I can have a perfectly merry day with a run of the mill meal. Unfortunately, there are some experiences that don't fit in to any of my \"I will return again and again or at least recommend to friends\" template.
 
 Majerle's is one of those experiences.

I know that I should definitely give this place another try but only because I had such a bad time I think that it must have been entirely abnormal because it would be out of business if it was run this way daily.
 When I arrived on Sunday afternoon (right as the Cardinals game was about to start), there were several content tables already enjoying their beer and bar fare. I must say that the food wasn't terrible. I wouldn't classify it as anything special or something that I would crave on any particular day. But the wings were crisp, the salad was fresh'ish' and the burger was prepared to the temp I ordered. This is where the one star came from. Decent food (good temp, tastes like what it's supposed to, sans hair, ect) deserves some credit.
 
   If I could give negative stars for service, this would be a -5 Stars type of place. Our server was either hung over or was just entirely uninterested in doing ANYTHING that her job description calls for. She greeted us about ten minutes after we sat down (although it was a Cardinals game day, the bar was probably about half full). She took our drink order and returned with our drinks ages later (well, another almost ten minutes). I was starving and ready to order food but wasn't able to because she slammed the drinks on the table and left again. I flagged down another server and he was so kind as to send ours back. FINALLY I ordered. Again, the food was fine. It wasn't, however, fine enough to cancel out the fact that our appetizer was delivered 20 minutes laster followed IMMEDIATELY by our entree's. Ok. Fine. But, the salad was wrong the first time (Note: When your guests are ordering, it helps to listen to what they actually want. It is NOT a good practice to forget and then just 'guess' what they said). And our server didn't even deliver our food so we couldn't order another drink until we flagged her down again. We ordered another two beers and waited. And waited. And waited. I saw our beers sitting on the bar and our server chatting in the corner to another associate. We couldn't get her attention so my dining companion/boyfriend went to the bar himself to get them. In fact, we didn't see our server again for the rest of the meal. I was so irate at this point that I wanted to leave immediately and spend our Sunday afternoon football watching/beer drinking pennies elsewhere. I flagged down the same server I asked to find my server the first time and had him do my bidding again (he seemed to be working, why couldn't I have sat in HIS section?) She came over, mumbled some apology about having to get our own beers and dropped our check. 
  Bright points: They have a great tv set up for football watching. Multiple tv's tuned to every single game you could imagine. 
Not so Bright Points: For me, watching football at a sports bar has necessary accoutrements (steady flow of beer, timely delivery of food, ect) to make it enjoyable. This mark was completely missed due entirely to the complete disregard our server had for her job. Or her guests.
Downright Dim points: Well, this review pretty much sums it up.
 If I'm in the area and kind of desperate, perhaps I'll try it again. Probably Not."}
{"text":"Everyone knows Majerle's is overpriced and doesn't feature the highest quality food (frozen burger patties)
That being said, it wasn't a bad three hours spent here watching football on a Sunday morning/afternoon. They need alot more food specials (they had one), but the drink specials, including $3 domestic drafts, were up to snuff. Every single football game was on one of the TV sets and they featured the Cardinals volume. It just depends on what you order and your price points in your head to determine if you made a wise dining decision. The chicken tacos were very wise with three chicken stuffed tacos served with incredibly fresh chips and some salsa. The place mostly filled up by 11:30am and service was great as well. Lots of regulars saving seats at bar (AKA the older drunks), but friendly crowd and shout out to the poor older Bills fan who still is a passionate fan despite no playoffs in like 20 years."}
{"text":"Bocce ball, bags in the backI. Make a night with friends! My giant gets their pizza every time he goes and it is amazing."}
{"text":"Great spot when El Hefe and everything else is packed! Drinks are priced well, my only complaint is service is fairly slow...I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt since its spring training and rather late. Not bad, but not great."}
{"text":"A coworker and I were ignored by the staff and I haven't been back. There were no other customers in the bar, only the bartender and we could see other servers in the back walking around. It's not like they were busy. After sitting there for a few minutes, someone came by to give us waters. By the time our water was gone, we still had not seen our sever again to order. We just left and went to Hard Rock Cafe."}
{"text":"Great spot to watch sports - especially with the cooler weather, sit outside! They are really accommodating with tv game requests too. Service was quick and attentive. They have a breakfast menu served until 1PM. Try the $4 spicy Bloody Mary HH on Sunday! Cool atmosphere, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my third and second favorite of all the Majerle's locations. I went to watch football with a bunch of dudes. It was fun! The screens are fancy, the waitresses were on top of their game and the bathrooms were clean. I'll definitely hit up Majerle's again!"}
{"text":"Located within walking distance of Bank One Ballpark (MLB's Diamondbacks) and US Airways Center (NBA's Phoenix Suns) Majerle's (owned by three-time NBA all-star and local icon Dan Majerle) is a great place to go before and after a game. 

Weekend afternoons--game day or not--are relatively quiet, which means quick service and an attentive wait staff.  And while the food is typical of most sports grills (burgers, sandwiches, and fried appetizers, for example), it's a great place to unwind or to escape the Phoenix heat.  There are the requisite large televisions tuned to the day's sporting events and plenty of memorabilia lining the walls.  Despite these sports bar staples, the place is actually quite cozy and quaint.

But while Majerle's is good in the afternoons, it absolutely rocks after Suns or D-Backs games.  The place is typically packed and it's not uncommon to find local or visiting athletes sipping beers on the narrow sidewalk patio.  The bartenders are personable and charming and it's not unusual for one of them to grab the mic and wander the restaurant singing karaoke (and singing it well).  The spontaneity of patrons singing duets with the bartender or serenading their dates to late-'80s pop ballads makes for a great party-like atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hit Majerle's on the way to a Dbacks game yesterday thinking we'd get better and cheaper food than at the game. Boy was I wrong!  The wings were okay, but the chef really needs to work on his/her knife skills. I ordered the chicken sandwich with sprouts and avocado. It came without any other condiments. This was a problem since it was the driest piece of chicken I had EVER attempted to eat. Luckily the waitress hadn't cleared the wing plate and I was able to use the ranch to get 1/2 of my sandwich down. I would have returned it but our waitress had disappeared after my husband didn't order a second beer.
Speaking of my husband, he ordered a burger that also came without condiments. He waited patiently for 15 minutes for our waitress to reappear, finally asking some other server for mayo. She also refilled our drinks. When our waitress returned with the bill and to clear the dishes no apology was made for her lack of service nor were any questions asked about the food remaining on my plate.  I would have given it one star, but they have really cold beer and great thin fries. 
So, remember if like something besides catsup on your sandwiches you'd better ask, and stay away from the chicken."}
{"text":"Went to Marjerle's at Chandler Fashion last night for a birthday party and here's a list of things that went wrong:

1. Our reservation information was incorrect. We reserved a party of  25 people and they only put us down for 10. They also had the time wrong by an hour. Thankfully, they weren't busy.
2. We had to argue with the server more than once in order to add more tables onto ours even though they weren't busy and we were seated outside which was practically empty.
3. Our server had a bad attitude almost immediately and when we asked for a different server our request was ignored. We were given attitude whenever we asked questions about the menu items and she never once smiled. 
4. We inquired about a Chambord vodka shot and we received Chambord liqueur shots instead. When we sent them back unconsumed there was attitude from both the server and the bartender as well. 
5. Finally, when we decided to speak to Jeff, the manager, he was condescending and tried to discount our complaints with an argument for why his staff behaved the way that they did. He didn't listen to everything we had to say before he jumped in and started defending them. He then told us that the staff complained about us as well which is very unprofessional. Our request for a different server was finally honored and she was lovely, but it was much too late to salvage this establishment's reputation as far as I'm concerned. 
6. Lastly, when I received my bill I had been charged for the shot that was returned and one person was charged $3 more for the same beverage that several others had been served throughout the evening. There was also 20% gratuity already added to all the checks. 

This was my first and last visit to Majerle's."}
{"text":"Sports Illustrated rated this place as one of the twenty best sports bars in the country.  While that's probably a stretch, the food and grog here are very good, and there is always a TV nearby featuring sports.

I'd be torn between 4 and 5 stars for Majerle's, but one time I was here eating a salad at the bar and Thunder Dan himself came up and asked how I was enjoying everything.  Very outgoing and friendly guy, so let's give him 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very nice bar tender, Michelle! Super sweet and attentive.

But the food is meh. So bland and ordinary looking we didn't bother to order food.

Beer selection is lame. No imagination at all. As if they allow the distributor to make the beer menu. Are there no local craft brews in Phx? If there are, they aren't in tap here.

Sports? If you need a sports bar, walk a block or two to Coach's Corner. If you want a wanna be Hooters? This place sort of works?"}
{"text":"Fun place to drink & hang out, but the food is typical bad bar food. I like the music they play and love the giant glass windows that open out so on a nice day/night it feels very indoors/outdoors. If you're with a large group, it can be really hard to hear each other because the audio they play is a little too loud for before 9 pm. I was very unimpressed by their Happy Hour, which other reviewers have called out as well, and the food was disappointing. 

- Nachos: Terrible. The \"cheese sauce\" was little better than the canned orange stuff. Not much in the way of toppings other than a few olives and jalapenos. Probably the worst nachos I've had at a bar in AZ yet.
- Strawberry Field Salad: I've had pretty good luck with salads at sports bars in Scottsdale, but this was not the case here. A light layer of lettuce covered in mediocre feta cheese and bruised strawberries. Just not that good.
- Margarita Pizza: This was the best thing I ate all night. Good crust, good toppings. Pretty hard to mess up pizza so this is a safe bet.

Trivia on Tuesdays is fun here but the food and $6.50 for a Coors Light sort of kills it for me."}
{"text":"Hamburger bun too big and should be toasted. Meat patty too big for bun and not enough flavor.   Fun and great service"}
{"text":"Sat down at 6.50 waitress did not come over until 7. I told the waitress I would like to order I said make sure that they our extra crispy chicken wings for an appetizer when I got them just by looking at them they did not look crispy at all by that time said had walked away.  I thought well let me try them well the skin was not crispy it was mushy so I sat them aside for her to take back she disappeared for about 10 minutes after 7 I had Eaten a couple because I was starving. We also had empty drinks for a awhile. Then my nephew ordered grilled chicken salad it came out with crispy chicken salad when she sat it down my nephew said it was supposed to be crispy SHE SAID I KNOW well if she knew why did she even bring out his order to him that just showed me she did not care about our food or serve at all."}
{"text":"Great stuff here, not your average sports bar food.  I would call the burgers more of a \"Grommet Burger\" and their Buffalo Wings are better than you'll get at any Buffalo Wild Wings or Hooters.  Lots of beer on tap too"}
{"text":"Ohhh my goodness, I know that I live here and I KNOW that this is a crazy time in AZ, but I had no idea how crazy Old Town Scottsdale would be at 6 PM (I thought it was a late night scene, no?) Uhg, I must be getting old! I told my friends from out of town to meet us here to watch March Madness and it was CRAZYYY! If I didn't have a headache, I would have probably been way more into it! ;) 

We ended up sitting at the bar after waiting for a little while, not totally ideal but we were hungry! Apparently they DO reserve tables (regardless of the size), which is great to know when coming to watch future sporting events here! 

Ok, onto the food. It is definitely your typical 'bar food' type of place. I ordered the house salad with grilled chicken + ranch & buffalo sauce. For $7 (before you add the chicken), it was REALLY small! I definitely thought it would be bigger than a side salad due to the price, but nope. They also forgot the cheese and croutons, but i'll give them the benefit of the doubt since they were busy! The beer was ice cold and the bartender was VERY friendly! I'm assuming we'll be back since it is in the heart of Scottsdale and a great place to watch sports!"}
{"text":"Ugh - stopped in here before a Diamonbacks game and quickly left after a beer. It's tiny, cramped (but not in a fun, packed house kind of way), and so very dark. It was kind of a mood killer. They do have a patio but didn't have the misters on and weren't serving out there. With all the beautiful weather we get in Arizona, I hate being cooped up in dark small places."}
{"text":"First time there and visiting from out of state. Place was packed on a Saturday evening. Maybe because there was a D-Backs game at Chase Field, as this is a sports bar. Somewhat limited seating. We had a large group so ended up sitting outside, mind you this was summer time so very warm. There were misters on the outside patio seating area but the misters faced the sidewalk so didn't do a good job of cooling the patio area. Ordered a draft beer for $6 and a salad for $13. Yes, a salad from a sports bar. It was ok, nothing special. I would recommend this place more for the great bar ambiance."}
{"text":"Majerles will not be on my list of go-to places the next time I am in the Phoenix area.

Ordered a Caesar salad with grilled shrimp and a side of avocado.  I feel like this is one of the few things you really cannot mess up when dining out anywhere, but the plate I had at Majerles was supremely subpar - there weren't many pieces of shrimp on the salad.  It was mostly a big plate of green with a few shrimps and they weren't well-seasoned either.  A few pieces of shrimp were really bland and then some were over-seasoned with whatever spice they threw on there.  The side of avocados was not a pleasant sight, they actually gave it to me on a small plate and the slices were half-browned by the time the plate arrived on the table.  Sure, I occasionally eat partially-browned avocados at home in my own kitchen, but I wouldn't serve it up to someone if I owned my own restaurant!  

The service was attentive, but not overbearing.  Our server was really nice.  I'd be much more interested exploring the other dining options that are available in the area instead of returning to Majerles next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday, nice quiet bar with exceptional food value.  Try the shrimp tacos- cilantro and sauce are delightful.   Pork tacos are huge for a $2 Street taco.   Plenty of menu options and the location is excellent for pre and post game/convention meet ups.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Alexis was a great server. We had an awesome experience!  We definitely will be back. The chicken tacos were soooo good. My husband loved the rojo diablo."}
{"text":"I want so bad to give a good review, because we have eaten here a lot. But it's always hit or miss. Depends on server. But today, my dear family dog died, so like any fun people, we go to happy hour to celebrate her life. And had the worst experience. First the server seemed annoyed, and wanted to deny my 27 year old boyfriends Id because the film started lifting in the corner, and then got a manager who wanted to double check? It's an Id!!! Legally they need to take it regardless. One server who we love said \"omg I have had you guys so much it's fine\" just went and got the problem fixed. Then the busser that works here is such a jerk, I mean jerk, my boyfriends chicken wings came out, he asked for blue cheese and said hey I'm sorry is this blue cheese or ranch and he said \"looks like ranch\" (sarcastically) and then when my boyfriend asked about receiving 7 chicken wings instead of 8 ( it says in the h.h menu 8 but comes w 7, later explained that's an old menu and doesn't count) but anyways, the busser was such a jerk belittled my bf and said dude I'm just a busser you need to asks your server dude. Plus some. Anyways I just had to review our rude awful experience today on such a sad day. But normally just hit or miss.

This was my first review that when I came to review it I read and remembered this.. so fast forward a year we've came back several times. We're pretty happy here- again... hit or miss. But recently we realized that the drinks are WEAK.. and I mean weak.. for my paying that much for a vodka drink I shouldn't taste just soda (and even handed to my
Friend who doesn't drink vodka and didn't taste it) . Idk if minimum wage is causing them
To be smarter with pours or if it's the bartender dark long hair, fake eyelashes, but they should fix that issue. We always choose Here for happy hour and drinks but sadly cut our dinner here short just to go drink at lucky lous because the drinks are half of the price and you can tell they put alcohol in there. Oh we also ordered two shots because thendrink was weak and well it's date night so we wanted to have fun and the shots were little to nothing. Just a tip for management and bartenders! But foods amazing! And when you get the right server- great experience"}
{"text":"Super overpriced for less than mediocre food. Also dirty, we had to ask for clean plates and silverware. I just spent $11 on a burger that was just meat and a burnt bun and had to pay extra to add cheese...very strange. maybe a good place if you're only drinking and watching sports but don't even bother with the food, we will definitely not be coming back."}
{"text":"Just finished enjoying one of the BEST burgers I've had in a long time! I had without a bun, cooked medium, delicious!

The whole table enjoyed their meals and sharing the GIANT warm cookie desert topped it off! 

Great service, friendly staff, even Jeff Majerle visited our table a couple of times! Well definitely be back to this upscale sports bar with too many HD TV ' to count!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of bar food, especially when it's not all meat and cheese. The buffalo shrimp is to die for! I need to check myself into buffalo shrimp rehab. 

I just drooled on myself on accident as I was writing about this. It's that good! It is the perfect appetizer to order on a date or with friends. 

I really enjoy the atmosphere here. It doesn't have the hustle and bustle of the rest of old town. Sure, it's loud, but it's only like that late night. When my girlfriends are dancing their butts off across the street at the club, you can find me here with a basket of sweet potato fries and ranch watching the highlights on ESPN. 

They have something on the menu for everyone from kids to vegans. I highly recommend this for late night grub!"}
{"text":"Normally I have great service but I'm a little taken back tonight.  After being seated, I waited over 12 minutes before I got up and asked if someone was going to take my order.  This is unacceptable when the place isn't even busy.  Again, not the normal service I get here but very frustrating."}
{"text":"Back yet again..the best drinks and burgers and fries ever!! Marjelrita with grand Marnier..this will always be a favorite great place to come to chill talk with my love."}
{"text":"Great sports bar!

Beer on tap selection is meh.. but I've learned to not expect much from sports bars.

The wing secret sauce is a MUST-HAVE. It's the perfect amount of spicy and sweet.

Here's what we ordered and how it was:

Rojo Diablo - it's fried chicken breast dipped in the special wing sauce and mozzarella is added. The flavors were all there! The bread is mildly sweet which was a nice touch. The chicken was a bit a dry but I ordered wing sauce on the side which helped.

Sweet potato fries - If you like sweet potato fries, these will do the job. Nothing to crazy, just your average sweet potato fries.

Gorilla Wings in Mild - think Native Newyorker Wings. This is the quality. It does the job and is much better than the Hooters down the street

Gorilla Wings in Secret Sauce - DO IT.

Fries - If you're not a shoestring fries fan, then don't get them! They are just your basic shoestring fries.

Fish Tacos - I didn't try them but was told they did a great job.

Potato Skins - Good!

Cheese Fries - They're basically fries with cheese melted on top.  Sooo yeah. They're good though! At least it's not processed cheese. 

It's bar food. So expect bar food quality. It's a great place to watch the game. Some of the loudest most active fans come to this location so be forewarned.

The customer service was great! They messed up our order twice but we got a free beer and free order of fries so, no complaints here. Plus they were super busy so no hard feelings."}
{"text":"No silverware, STILL, and we're checking out. Reminded waitress several times that we didn't have utensils to eat with, or napkins. Finally went to the bar for bar napkins and ate food with my hands. Appetizer took 45 min to come out, we cancelled the rest of the food because who knows how long that would have taken. It wasn't even that busy. Will not ever come back."}
{"text":"I know its a sports bar but they have the best cosmos ever! Sweet Potato fries are a must. The Nachos were ok. Good happy hour prices and a lot of indoor and out door seating. Always go when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times, but this was by far the best experience I've had. It was two Sundays ago, myself and seven friends wanted to watch the early games and get some food and drinks. My friend called ahead and made a reservation. When we got there, we had a big table reserved right in front of all the TVs. Our waitress was very attentive, friendly and quick. They had a bunch of beer bucket deals that we all took advantage of and had a great time watching all the games, enjoying some beverages and eating some food. Their breakfast burrito with chorizo was fantastic and it'll keep me coming back. See ya next Sunday, Majerle's!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Hostesses and waitresses went out of their way to make sure all customers could watch the football they wanted.  Our table had chips/salsa/guac, sandwich, and a burger.  All great.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"PASS...

Very mediocre food when surrounded by a lot of great options.  I can't believe the food network came here?!"}
{"text":"Cool sports bar. It was the only place that I could find with some atmosphere when I was in Phoenix. Everyone parties in Scottsdale. What's up, Phoenix? Why don't you like to have fun downtown?"}
{"text":"Oh yum. $3.00 cocktails with an old friend and chicken tenders. I vote yes on all counts. They did a great job of handeling the March madness crowd too. I travel to Chandler a lot for business so this will be my new place to poke in and grab a drink and some yummy food. I love the patio also nice combo of outside/inside seating. Word."}
{"text":"How about those Suns? Well like our favorite basketball team this season Majerle's Sports Grill missed the mark. The Chandler location can be found just outside the Chandler Fashion Center and sounds like a great place to stop by and have a burger after a long day.

Unfortunately, the menu did not live up to the lovable Dan Majerle. Let's start with the fries. On the menu they are called MegaCrunch Fries but they couldn't have been more bland. Where's the salt? But the fries weren't the worst part of Majerle's. That honor goes to the coleslaw that they must have borrowed from a school cafeteria. If you are planning a visit order something that states on the menu several different toppings! That way you don't have to worry about dying of food boredom.

A much better use of your money would be to head down to Fleming's Steakhouse during their happy hour and trying their Fleming's Prime Burger. It's only 6 bucks during their happy hour from 5-7.

If you were going to hang out with a group of friends for the night and order a lot of beers this might be the place for you if you don't care what you're snacking on in the mean time.

Sorry Dan."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Friday evening.  I got to say that the burger was delicious,  had the #9 all star burger and it was cooked perfectly to my liking and the hamburger bun was so good.  Shoe string fries were nice and crunchy. My son had the Jared Dudley's Grilled Chicken which he said was good.   Our waitress was attentive and kept our glasses refilled. Will definitely come again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but what can you expect from a sports bar that is mainstream as well as a chain in the valley. I's say the downfall of the joint are the prices on drinks and the food that is only okay :/ Perhaps it is the proximity to the stadiums that make them think they can charge a premium, but in the end they cannot for long as many will not return to a spot that they find to be marginal at best and expensive."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I started meeting friends for NFL Sundays here and I'm definitely a fan.  Good drink specials, great wings and a ton of TVs. The servers are friendly ..... no complaints :)"}
{"text":"Hamburgers, wings and cold beer - it doesn't get better on a hot hot day in Phoenix   Still a very typical noisy sports bar in downtown PHX. Good place to grab a bite to eat if you are stuck in the PHX excuse of a downtown"}
{"text":"They have a very good happy hour during the week. Almost all appetizers are half price. You can make a nice meal of sliders, chicken tenders, wings etc. I would recommend as a place to enjoy a quick informal meal while watching a game."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give them a star at all.. service was HORRIBLE the waitress was rude. Our food came out after a long wait & was cold of course & it was not busy.. We then ask for a manager because we were missing a burger and one of the burgers had onions on it.. The manager just sent the burger back so we had to wait even more for our food.. The waitress brings our bill over separate instead of asking if it's together then she has the nerve to roll her eyes at us.. we paid for our bill SEPARATELY & left.."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game, pretty good prices and good food.  But, the service kills it.  Our waitress seemed \"put out\" by having to serve us.  Too bad because everything else about this place is good."}
{"text":"Yes it's 12:47 and they are trying to kick out regular paying customers. I have 6 of my closest friends here. I know for a fact that this place is open till 2 am and also yelp agrees with me. Worst bartender ever number 213 on my receipt ticket."}
{"text":"YUMMY! I came here with a group of girl friends, with the recommendation from one of the workers at the hotel we were staying at, and I am really glad we listened. We went in on a Tuesday night and the place was packed, luckily we were able to get the last available table for six.

There are televisions everywhere, and loud music playing, we couldn't even hear ourselves talk! It was a fun environment, and the food is delicious. Everyone loved what they ordered. I had the teriyaki chicken sandwich with fries, so good! Apparently some dishes were featured on Food Network :)

If I ever had to go back to Phoenix, I would definitely make a stop here!

-R"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour last night in a big group out on the patio. I had the blt and some appetizers at happy hour prices. The food alone I would give 3 maybe 4 stars, but giving 5 for great service. Our waitress was super positive, was readily available for any requests that came up and kept our drinks topped off. Really great service!"}
{"text":"First time at Majerle's with three others. We went before the Rattlers playoff game but after a D-Backs game, so it was really hopping in there. Got seated right away though. 

We were seated in the back room and although our server was pleasant, it lengthened our service time considerably. 
Our daughter ordered the salad special. It had bountiful toppings and the right amount of dressing. Her husband got the Rojo Diablo sandwich. He said it was 'stringy' and didn't finish it. My wife ordered a burger and asked that it be wrapped in romaine for a 'lettuce bun'. She got a burger sitting on top if green leaf lettuce. I got the All-Star burger. It was good but overcooked by two levels. 

The fries and sweet potato fries were good, as was the selection of drinks. All told, for three sandwiches, a salad and six beers it totaled $85. Too expensive for the quality but they charge a lot due to location. 

Thunder Dan better get back to his restaurant and read the reviews. I may not be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in and the greeters and waitress were fabulous. 

One of the best quesadillas EVER."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, love that they play music during commercial breaks, close to home AND the food's good.  There are LOTS of TVs everywhere, plus service is great and the food is ready in minutes!  This is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"This place is worth a return visit if in the area. It's classic bar food but it was all delicious and very reasonably priced. We started with the queso fries which were very tasty. I love the use of the shoestring potatoes. Our burgers and sandwiches were all very good and the portions so large most of us couldn't finish our meals. We didn't get a chance to try any of the drinks other than sodas.

We were seated right away but it was only 6pm. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was lively with chatter and tv. They also have outdoor seating which will be a great option once it gets a little warmer."}
{"text":"Solid place to day drink and watch games, and is right in the middle of all the night time action as well.  Good food and chill atmosphere, I'll be going back the next time that I am in \"the Dale\"."}
{"text":"Are you a douche bag?  Do you have more money than sense?  Does it make you all warm and fuzzy to way overpay for a mediocre drink?  If so, Majerle's is the place for you!  

Personally, I never cared for the \"owner\" when he was with the Suns, and this establishment has done nothing to change that opinion.  The food is bland at best, but for the prices it should have a little flavor.  I'm not sure what criteria the staff uses when deciding who to grace with their presence, but the female servers sure weren't responding to me (a woman) even when I held out a $20.00 - my 6'3\" friend had much better luck, he was the one that had to order my drink.  

I'm disappointed, this is such an easy place to hit on a light rail pub crawl or before or after a game or concert, but I just don't think I can bring myself to go back willingly."}
{"text":"Another favorite happy hour place!  They have good deals on beer and a couple food items.  I used to get the twisted breadsticks, but for some reason they took them off the menu.  Don't worry, if you ask for them, they'll make 'em.  :)

Service is great here....attentive and quick for how busy it usually is around 5pm.  Oh yes, and single ladies should definitely be here for happy hour - lots of men!  Probably married men let out for a few hours on a weekend....but men nonetheless!  And for the fellas, there are a lot of good looking waitresses....very cute."}
{"text":"Lower your expectations and you will love it.
We've been here several times and I have never been overly impressed nor disappointed, I do think their prices are a little too high however for mediocre bar food,  and their service is rarely anything to write home about. 
Today we attempted to go for happy hour. We sat outside for over 40 minutes while several waitresses passed us by and didn't even bother to acknowledge us. We couldn't even get them to look in our direction. It wasn't until we decided to leave that we got their attention. This place is not known for their service so lower your expectations when you go there and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"I stop in Majerle's pretty regularly to catch part or all of a current sporting event.  Always a great atmosphere.  The food is pretty average for a sports bar but my favorite items are the burgers.  You can always get the game you want on one of the numerous TV's in the place.  Booths are big and comfortable for group seating.  The staff is always pleasant and helpful with whatever you need."}
{"text":"If I deducted a star for each 'f-bomb' I heard from your bar staff you'd owe me 6 stars. If staff is comfortable acting like this when no management is around it makes me curious as to what else could be happening, but that's not for me to worry about. Overall, I'm deducting one star."}
{"text":"The fish & chips were excellent, the place was clean and the atmosphere was friendly.  Our server, Dani, I believe, was friendly, knowledgeable, & helped make it a pleasure to be there.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar, nothing special here.  Good thing I don't drink, especially after reading some of the reviews.

We started with TENDERLOIN SLIDERS (thinly sliced Filet Mignon served as a slider, not bad).

I had PETIE'S CROISSANT (A typical croissant sandwich with turkey).  It was good, but nothing special.  

Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back for lunch, but I wouldn't ever go out of my way for it though."}
{"text":"Got roped into coming here for lunch with a bunch of co-workers...apparently, today is the first day of March Maddness.

It's a lot classier than I expected; comfortable seating, and actually not nearly as loud as I would have guessed, given the term \"sports bar\" on the side of the building.

The glasses for soda and iced tea were huge, and were refilled fairly quickly as we drank them down.  Beers and non-alcoholic drinks came out fast, but the service was kind of slow regarding getting our order taken, and eventually, in getting the checks.

This place is NOT veggie friendly, and definitely not for my vegan friends.  I had pretty much two choices; make your own pizza, or spinach queso dip. I went with the dip.  Expensive at almost $9? Yes, but it was the perfect amount of food for a main course. I just wish that they had a veggie burger option, because I totally would have loved a burger and fries.

$11.50 for chips, spinach queso and an iced tea...a little steep to me.  Would I come here again? Maybe -- but only for a company bonding, sport watching lunch."}
{"text":"Place was great the first time I went, Second time one of Dan's fair weather buddies (thinking he was big shooter) disrespected a good friend of mine over a misunderstanding that could have easily been solved through civil conversation, but he tried to be Mr. Big Shot.  

The food was good, but not good enough to put up with that crap ever again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the rueben sandwich again today at lunch. The frequent customer punch card is a pretty decent deal too."}
{"text":"We came here on a very busy evening. The service was very good! The young lady was really attentive even though the restaurant was filled. I had a tall beer on draft, and some nachos which were actually pretty good. My friends enjoyed their beers and food as well! Even though the food was great, the five stars is for our waitress! I wish I got her name, but we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Great atmosphere.  Did not eat so can't comment on that."}
{"text":"Ordered the nachos.  Cheese sauce was terrible.  Didn't taste like cheese, it was runny, yellow and watery.  Taco Bell's nachos are much better!   Waitress didn't really seem to care."}
{"text":"Great local spot to watch live sporting events. Love all the girls working the bar, they are great. Would definitely recommend hitting Majerles up if you're nearby!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good food avoid Majerle's 
If you want to watch sports and drink this is a good place to be
And it's nice that they turn music on during commercials

I really don't understand how Majerle's food is as bad as it is. Really, it's not good. The french fries aren't even good, french fries! How do you have a sports bar with bad buffalo wings!?!

The happy hour specials are good, minus the food. If you must eat something off the HH menu get the sliders

The patio at Majerle's is a great atmosphere although their policy on reserving tables is inconsistent as hell...

I want to give this place a 2 but it's not that bad.
If Majerle's had had better food this place would be a great place to watch games. But if food is key go to Zipps.

Everytime a game comes on and my friends want to get together we have the same argument. Majerle's (Good scenery & bad food) or Zipp's (No scenery & good food)."}
{"text":"Just a few blocks from Chase field & US airway arena. Great beer selections and specials. I recommend the chicken wings."}
{"text":"It's a sportsbar, so I know I can't be too picky, but Majerle's could add at least one or two decent microbrews (Shock Top does NOT count) and they could freaking turn down the awful music mix during halftime at 2 pm on Saturday to sub-ear bleeding levels.

Great service, though! That should be mentioned."}
{"text":"Great wings. Cold beverages. Authentic decorations and an owner I respect. Well done Dan!

Don't Underestimate the Burgers!"}
{"text":"HUGE disappointment!!!! Stopped for a quick dinner before a show. Ordered 2 burgers medium. They came out extremely well done & the buns were hard & dry. The waitress took them back to the kitchen & returned with 2 more well done burgers! What the heck?! When we told her (& showed her), she apologized & took 20% off the bill. We didn't have time for round 3. They didn't even send a manager over. $30 for an inedible meal. We will not be back. I'd recommend trying somewhere else."}
{"text":"i cannot attest for the sports bar side of things but i really liked the food for lunch... the serivce was good and quick... compared to alot of the places in the area i found the food quality pretty high by lunch standards... i will definatly go back... maybe even to watch some sport next time..."}
{"text":"It has to be said - I am the Wife of a Sports Fan.  We eat at sports bars.......a Lot.

This place is clean, the seating is comfortable and they have a GREAT basic salad (fresh spring greens, that thin shredded cheese, lovely sliced cukes and crunchy croutons) with the BEST ranch dressing - I mean creamy, rich, full-bodied Ranch!

So I can dig into whatever appetizer he orders and look forward to the Salad chaser!  \"He\" said \"everything\" when I asked what he liked on their menu!  There you go!"}
{"text":"\"Hey Dan! How's it going?\" 
\"It's going good! You?\"
\"I'm great! Good game last night.\"
\"Thanks man!\"

This is the conversation I had with Dan Majerle the last time I was there. There's NOT a better sportsbar downtown the Majerle's. Great beer selection, great food, great location, and if your luckey you can talk to Dan freaking Majerle! That guy drains 3's and half court shots like a stripper uses her pole. Majerle's is a MUST on game day. Before, after, or both."}
{"text":"Stopped in to watch the Rangers baseball playoff game at 1PM on a Thursday.  The place was pretty dead. They did put the sound on for the game when I asked. When it's not happy hour the prices are on the high side for a sports bar. Beers that cost $4.75 elsewhere cost $6 here.  I tried the wings and the chips and salsa.  Again over priced. The salsa and chips were ok but cost $6. I got the wings right when happy hour started which reduced the price to $6. They were on the soggy side.  The hot sauce was ok, but overall just avg at best. The staff was attentive and helpful.  

I did like all the big TV's but with so many other better options, I probably won't be back for over priced beer and avg food."}
{"text":"Very nice place, a little smaller than I thought it would be but still great.  The Bartenders were great, very quick and attentive, very friendly, very helpful in recommending some places to hang out.  Just had a beer and a House Salad but it was delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience and food!  Service was so fast we were barely done with apps when food came.  Server was on top of everything. Great food. Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great sports bar in downtown Phoenix!  The servers are amazing too!  Great place to have a beer and watch sports on TV."}
{"text":"Bar staff/Management Clueless to who they partner with
When a bar partners with a company to provide a service to potential customers, it's usually expected that the staff & management are trained on the partnership, and how to accept any offers the said customers are wanting to redeem for. However, more than one staff member was inept about a particular program _in which the bar asks to join_. The (assumed) manager tonight was looking for any reason not to honour the program, even after being advised what the program is and how it is redeemed. Even with another customer explaining as well, since they have used it, the manager was still refusing to honour what they had partnered for - even though she was trying to claim she was not refusing to honour it.

You have a choice of bars in Downtown - DON'T make it Majerle's."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite bars in Old Town. It is casual with really good food but plays loud top 40 music with great drinks. What more could you ask for?

Service is great and the bathrooms are clean. The restaurant has outdoor seating which is great for people watching and right in the heart of Old Town nightlife.

You're within walking distance to The Mint, Dollhouse, Smashboxx, and the Pussycat Lounge. 

If I didn't live a $40 cab ride away (one-way) I'd come here way more often. 

Lots of huge flat panel tvs and plenty of seating. It gets packed on weekends but the place is pretty big so it never feels overwhelmingly crowded. 

This is not a good place to dance. There is actually no dance floor. But maybe that won't stop you or I after a few drinks..."}
{"text":"Went here because we had a BOGO lunch special coupon. It's a typical sports bar. Lots of TVs. Seated right away in a booth with good views of all the sporting events. Service was good. I ordered the Cuban sandwich with fries and hubby ordered the club sandwich with fries. 

The Cuban was meh. The pulled pork inside of the sandwich was kind of bland and a little fatty for my taste. The sandwich was pressed and was a little too buttered and greasy. The fries were skinny and crispy and good. 

Hubby enjoyed his club sandwich. 

There are so many places to eat that are better."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Awful food.  Everyone looked like they were working hard to make everyone happy.  Except maybe the cooks.  The food was gross.  Good Ranch dressing and fries though.  Thank goodness."}
{"text":"Great place to catch a suns game! Of course the name tells you what the decor is. Jerseys from the 90s line the walls. TV screens everywhere. Can't go wrong for sports here. Average bar food. Strong drinks. Go suns!"}
{"text":"I must be picky or just notice a lot of things.... lets list out the cons, then pros. This all occurred on a Saturday around 1pm.

Cons:
1) When asking the hostess if there are any spaces at the bar(which there appeared to be) she states \"no, there's someone in the bathroom\" and instead of asking the person who had his arm around two chairs(big dude), she made up a lie. No one sat in those seats and they were subsequently taken by new people 2 minutes afterward when they just walked up and sat down. Useless hostess.

2) The hostess brought water glasses over to the table on a serving tray and then sneezed in her hand(right hand) and proceeded to pick up our water glasses and place them on the table with the same hand. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?

3) It took 15 minutes to get a beer which was ordered after 5 minutes.(20 minutes to get a drink besides water)

4) There were people sitting every other seat seat at the bar, with their legs/arms around other chairs. The bartender or manager needs to come by and make sure the chairs are open for potential guest by putting them sideways or in a fashion that makes them available for use and not for random body parts to be held up by. None of these person appeared to be holding spaces for other individuals... just their feet.

5) Very loud people who were clearly drunk making the atmosphere difficult to hear or have a conversation with.

6) With so many tvs, they only had three things on: their dumb music videos, news, and some reality tv show. No sports(except on the news when it was re-capping). 


Pros:
1) Waitress acknowledged that they were busy and stated they were understaffed.(On a Saturday). She apologized for the issue with our waters and got us fresh glasses. Although she corrected the previous hostesses mistakes, she kept pushing asking us why we wanted our check... Don't keep asking me when we've already said we don't want to stay for \"X\" reasons. I shouldn't need to give a reason to get my check. 

I doubt we will be back here. Totally uninviting atmosphere, noisy, non-sports oriented. I thought this was a sports bar... guess it's just another wannabe scottsdale bar that just doesn't come 1/3 as close to it's expectations. Poor services, disgusting hostess practices, long wait times(even when it wasn't full).... not for me."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and bar food, although their fried chicken salad is actually pretty darn good. Staff is always pleasant and helpful, and the environment is as laid back as can be."}
{"text":"Best Sports Bar in Desert Ridge. Plenty of TVs and sound for big games. Gorilla Wings are the biggest wings in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar with the usual bar food. We really like the chicken strips and fries basket. Portions are a little smaller than the averagle sports bar (3 thin strips in an order) but there is a big serving of fries with it. The pizza was surprisingly good here. 

Service was a little slow on our last visit but I have a good amount of patience that it didn't bother me too much. Price is pretty on par, maybe a tad bit more, than other sports bar."}
{"text":"Great spot for downtown Phoenix sports.  Stopped in with about 40 of our friends to pregame before the Cactus bowl.  Had a great experience!  Ryan totally hooked us up with great tables.  Service was good for the crazy amount of fans in the place."}
{"text":"This was my first visit.  The place is greet with all of the outside patios.  We sat and watch the hockey playoffs.  The waitress was nice enough to change the channel for us.  The food was great and the service was very good.  Our waitress was very attentive and gave great recommendations on food selections.  Great atmosphere.  I will definitely be visiting more often.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. Once for lunch and several times for happy hour. The staff is very efficient and friendly. Somehow they always manage to keep our bar tab straight even when 20 of us show up together and hang out in the VIP section. The food is good and the drinks are great. If you like margaritas this is the place to go."}
{"text":"A group of girls and I went out for a co-workers birthday and we ended up sitting out on the front patio while we waited for the rest of our group. We loved the music they played, they also play the music videos on the big screen outside. 

I had a Blue Moon and it was delicious, but my only complaint would be inconsistencies in prices. I paid $5 for my beer while my friend payed $6.50. Not sure what's up with that, but this a great place to \"pre-game\" instead of spending $10 for the same thing at the surrounding clubs."}
{"text":"Good food , excellent service from the hostess to the waiters! Attentive ,friendly ,quality, cleanliness a+"}
{"text":"I didn't go out to lunch a lot because we had a fully stocked kitchen at the office, but when I did go out this was the most frequented. Majerle's is a great sports bar. A bunch of guys at the office were in to soccer so I would go with them to watch it here. 

I wasn't eating meat for hot second, and came here a couple times during that period. This is when I would indulge in the good ol' Traverse City Wrap. I love meat but that is a solid option if you don't. 

The sliders are and wings are awesome. They have a ton of good sandwiches and the shoestring fries are great. I always tell myself I'm not going to eat them all but they disappear by the end of the meal. Their personal pizzas are solid as well.

It's funny, there aren't that great of drink deals, at least not at lunch, but I always ordered a tall Ranger IPA for $7 which always got my bill around $20. You can probably be economical if you want, I just never was. 

Like I said, great Sports Bar."}
{"text":"My husband ate here just after buying me a very unmistakable anniversary gift at Comicon - a black & red cloth parasol in a black drawstring bag. It didn't look like anything special when it was inside the bag but once open, it had a unique red/black pattern. He accidentally left it there, so I went back the next day and asked the ladies at the front hostess stand if they had seen it. Both of the ladies there remembered exactly what it was and one of them said they had hid it under the hostess stand for safe keeping, but it was not there. She thought maybe someone had moved it to the office so she went to check. It wasn't there either. She took my number and said someone would call me later and let me know if anyone found it. The manager called me back and told me nobody else had seen it. We went back the next day to see if anyone had found it, but still the same story. 

So it was in their possession at some point and moved to a location that only the staff would have been aware of. But the manager came over and told me that \"anyone could have just seen it and taken it from under the hostess stand...\" which I find absurdly hard to believe. With as many eyes as are on the door, what are the chances of a random passerby digging around under the hostess stand without someone seeing them and saying something? 

But instead of actually doing something - anything - as a gesture of good faith, they just put on a smile and say how sorry they are. Basically all I got was, sorry-not-sorry that someone on our staff probably walked away with your anniversary gift but we literally don't care. I intentionally waited to see how long it would take or if anyone would even bother to follow up with me, but apparently my personal property of extraordinary sentimental value was not worth a follow up call. My friends and I used to use this place as a hub during Comicon every year. Never again."}
{"text":"First time here and I wasn't disappointed. I've heard of these restaurants around the valley but have never visit one. My wife finally convinced me! Restaurant was cleaned and well staffed, hostess was friendly and helpful. Our sever Phoenix was also great, we didn't see her much only a few times but that's the bar scene compared to a actual dine in restaurant. We only got a few app plates and let me tell you. These portions were a good size. Overall a great experience, definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing burgers you will eat!! I am a vegetarian and I did not walk in with a lot of expectation. We were in Arizona for a conference and this was an easy walk from convention center. Its the normal sports bar kind of space. I saw the menu and I was sold on the Fried Jalapeño burger which I got with a black bean patty and avacado!! Omg! It was hands down the best burger I have ever had. It came with a side of fries. Totally loved it. I have been recommending it to my friends who live in Arizona :)"}
{"text":"The only thing they did right was the blue moons we were drinking. The sliders my fiancé got were just plain no seasoning with a couple blue cheese crumbles thrown on and the steak quesidilla was just disappointing. Paid $20 for 4 Blue Moons which is pretty good but $23 for the food we ate.... Come to this place if you just want to drink.  The food at the Majerles in old town is 10x better!"}
{"text":"I love the TVs in the place, food not that great.  I ordered a salad, lettuce was wilted and gross.  Will just go to have drinks and watch TV next time, not to order food."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for a quick bite before a performance at the Symphony Hall. I had the Potato Skins for $11 with chicken for an additional $2 dollars. The Food was excellent but I thought it was a tad too pricey. The sever was friendly and attentive. I would stop in here for drinks after a game in the future."}
{"text":"Lots of seating and TVs.  Waitstaff was good.  Food is what you would expect at a sports bar, good but nothing unusual.  They turned on the game we want d to watch for us."}
{"text":"The service was fairly fast despite it being Comicon weekend. and the \"Garbage Burger\" was great.  The service was also very good.  My one complaint was the total chaos upon entering.   The hostess was overwhelmed."}
{"text":"I was a frequent visitor at Marjele's when I interned for the Phoenix Suns last season. It is a frequent stop for Suns employees...when we decide we can afford it or are celebrating someone's birthday. Thanks to Mr. Majerle we get a 10% discount that you can't complain about and if you ask the employees nicely, get a frequent meal club card thingy so you can at least get a free meal every once in awhile.

I admit the food is pretty bland, but it gets the job done when it comes to having only an hour-ish lunch break. I always end up getting the Amundson Chicken Sandwich or the Chicken Ceasar Wrap...mostly so I can eat those crunchy delicious fries (similar to Yard House fries if you've had those). 

The service is hit or miss...but that's ok. It's what you have to expect and just deal with it. 

It's always fun for us huge Suns fans to stop in there before or after the games to see some players and coaches, watch some ESPN, and have a great time."}
{"text":"First time at trivia night and our little team claimed victory so my overall impression of this Majerle's is very positive.   Food is standard bar fare, but the service was good with friendly and attentive servers.  I will be back..."}
{"text":"I came here with my family to get some drinks and appetizers and watch some football. They had a good mix of the games on TV, which was nice. We sat in a big booth near the bar. They had all-day happy hour specials on drinks. Sadly, no mojitos because they were out of mint, but I ordered a spicy Bloody Mary, and it was quite good and on special for $5.

We ordered a few appetizers to snack on: nachos, pretzel bites, and sweet potato fries. Our server was friendly and accommodating in putting some of the nacho toppings on the side for us. Everything was pretty tasty; I'd call it above-standard pub fare. Prices are about what you'd find in any similar establishment. Go during regular happy hour for half-price appetizers (not included on Sundays)."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night to watch football. It was also during the baseball playoffs, So we had one tv with the football game on and no sound, so that was disappointing. But we understood. The place was crowded, but the manager did his best to get us seated. The food was very good. We will be back other time."}
{"text":"Solid food, Great bar staff Home of rolling thunder. 

My best friend and girlfriend are both Chicago Bears fans. So that means two things:
1. I have bad taste in compan.
2. I'm here on most Sundays during football season. Most likely drinking Michelada's and smashing buffalo shrimp."}
{"text":"Rafaila is the sweetest server I have ever had! Service was attentive and we were here for awhile. Great environment and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. We went here with a group of friends to watch the World Cup.  It was tricky finding parking in Old Town. However the experience was great.

We were able to get tables right away. The service was great. Drinks we good. We had no problems!  The food was typical sports bar food and we got lots of appetizers to share. Nothing amazing, but good enough.

No complaints. It is a good casual sports bar to hangout at!"}
{"text":"This place never puts a frown on my face. Love it love it love it especially at night time great music great friendly staff great food I will never stop coming here!!!!!! Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Service was great but the food was just so-so. With so many local options, I don't think I would go back. I had the fish tacos. They were pretty bland and definitely needed the sauces they provided to give it something. And red and black (blue?) tortilla chips? Just .... no. Their other items may be great, but I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place to eat, drink, meet up with friends and watch a game. Highly recommend the Slam Dunk Shrimp with Chili Pepper Garlic sauce!


What the heck is a \"Fireside Discount\"? LOL"}
{"text":"I gave this place a pass on my first trip in since it was opening day of baseball. Now I have made my second and last visit here. It's a cool little place, and the staff is friendly. 

However, the cocktails are served with little or NO pour. I had vodka, soda w a splash of orange each trip, and the drinks are so weak I feel like I'm drinking lemonade. I hear the beers are full tilt, but the cocktail crowd needs to stay clear of this place."}
{"text":"Ducked in just to find a cool place to sit and a bite to eat. The efficient waitress brought out the BEST burger I've ever had.  And I've eaten lots if burgers in my 54 years.  A big juicy patty on a sweet Hawaiian style bun. They had a couple of burgers but I don't remember this one's name-- All Star Burger?  Anyway it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Went to Majerle's for the first time last Monday night to watch the Cards play Monday night football. I promise that I will not allow the horrible loss and embarrassing game played affect my thoughts on Majerle's! Sorry had to put that out there!
I have never seen in one place so many Cardinals fans! It was impressive! I lucked into a booth inside, showing up 45 mins before the game. It must have been meant to be!
I was very impressed with the amount of tvs and the quality! It was almost impossible to have a bad view of a tv, and in a sports bar this is the most important aspect!
Their happy hour specials were good, and I will be back because of them. We started with spicy chile garlic chicken wings, and they smelled really good! Problem...they didn't taste as good as they smelled, which is disappointing. Then we ordered the chicken strips, and they brought medium spice buffalo sauce...this sauce was probably the best buffalo sauce I have ever had...so next time I will make sure to order the chicken wings with the buffalo sauce, YUM!
I also got to try their spinach queso dip, which was okay...the only really good part was the wonton type chips that came with!
Over all a very good experience and I will be back at one point to watch a game and grab some grub!"}
{"text":"I went there for a couple of drinks and to order some food to go.  Huge mistake, not the drinks but the take out food.  I ordered a Chicken Taco Salad and a Chicken Quesadilla.  Unfortunately, we found Chicken Tacos that were extremely bland as well as the driest chicken I thought could be placed in food, but, alas, I was wrong.  As uninspiring as the chicken tacos were, the taco salad was ever so much worse.  Chunks of the hardest, driest chicken that were unchewable and the rest was a bunch of lettuce.  When I say this was bad, it was much worse.  Since Majerle took over Wolfley's, we hoped for better food, but really let down.  It was disgusting and I feel someone owes me an apology.  Go for drinks, but avoid the food."}
{"text":"To be honest, I went on a date here. Thanks Match :-) (have been using Match for many, many years, long story there)...but met a gal that I'd connected on that site with, for lunch at Majerle's. 

First off the door greeter, forgot her name (she was really cute though) because she was awesome, recommended various dishes, shared how much she loved the place... \"You're biased! You work here I said!\" \"You're right, but before I came to work here, I ate here and completely loved it! In fact, you should try these...\" and then she rattled off some things to try, which I ended up trying one of the dishes and she was right...AWESOME.

I had a bleu cheese burger for lunch. Pretty tasty, a lot of food for the price. Is that good? Not sure what their books are showing for a profit, but the size of the bread on that burger could be cut by about 1/2 and you'd still have a nice burger. The bun was so large that I had to cut it in half to eat. Mostly bun, the burger was cooked as requested, so no problems there at all.

Now, what does bother me as that normally when I bring a burger home or even to a hotel and put it in protective wrapping, then later on warm it up to have the remainder of it to eat, the results are not what I experienced from this burger. I reheated it in a microwave and after eating it became very sick and spent most of the night close to the porcelain throne just to make sure the world knew that I was King for that night.

Am sure it's probably just a fluke, but it could have been anything that was in that burger as I'd not had any other food during the day and this was an afternoon seating, around 2pm or so on Monday the 5th.

Additional information, the waitress assumed I guess that we were previous guests and was a bit rushed. Normally when I was waiting tables and was VERY successful at it, I would greet my tables and ask them \"Have you been a guest here previously? Or is this your first time?\". When I did that, I was able to establish rapport with my people and basically sell them anything on the menu that I desired them to enjoy and would reap the rewards via tip and remarks to my manager on the way out. When we left, the tip reflected the amount of service and there was not a manager in sight, otherwise I'd have been having a few words about the experience with them.

Not sure I'll be back to this chain of restaurants as I am sure there others out there who'd not only appreciate my business, but also my words of review when that time comes. I don't wish to be coddled, but I do expect to have a great meal no matter what time of the day it is and I expect value for what I am paying, and lastly I expect that the establishment will be guarding its own profits and providing not too much, but just enough to keep people talking and coming back for more.

{"text":"Love this place! It was convenient after Comicon for lunch & we all enjoyed our meals. Got 10% off our bill for showing our Comicon entry bracelets too."}
{"text":"Great food and good scenery. Friendly staff and a nice downtown spot to eat and enjoy yourself at."}
{"text":"We go to Majerles all the time and I have never been disappointed.  The food is good, the drinks are strong, and the service has always been great.  It's a fun place to watch football.  I will always be a huge fan of Majerles!"}
{"text":"Had the EY Fried Chicken (Salad) was very good. Nice size portion and chicken was seasoned."}
{"text":"First time visit and we picked a Saturday night with no pro sports downtown, knowing it wouldn't be crowded. Service from Olivia was excellent; she kept our beverages filled and otherwise checked back often without being intrusive. Food arrived much faster than anticipated, likely because it was not a full house . . . Jared Dudley's chicken sandwich with a side salad was very tasty . . . Decided to splurge and get dessert, and the brownie sundae is highly recommended! The vanilla ice cream underneath the brownie, chocolate sauce and whipped cream is both excellent tasting and amply supplied. . . . Another great feature is that a discount card is available for the asking, which gets you 15% off your total food & beverage. Overall, a great experience!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to grab some beer and some yummy wings when I'm in PHX! love love love this place. Been here about 3 times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been here so often I can't believe that I have never written a review! I l like the atmosphere here at Majerle's , the servers are always friendly and the drink specials are good. As a vegetarian their menu options are slim but they will modify an item if you ask nicely. I get the Sun's Melt without the hamburger patty. My favorite time to go is during trivia, it's fun to hang out after work with friends and prove that I am smarter than them ; )"}
{"text":"I always have a good time at Majerle's. The food is consistently good and service hasn't failed me yet. Most recently i've tried the Rojo Diablo sandwich (chicken breast fried & dipped in wing sauce of choice) with medium buffalo sauce... Yum! Nice and spicy but not torturous. Their crispy fries were good dipped in the extra sauce i got on the side too!  =)   My friends had some of the other sandwiches and the Asian Chicken salad. I got to try the salad and i may get that next time i'm there. The Asian dressing (sesame ginger) is really tasty! If you happen to be there on a day when they have Tortilla Soup, i'd recommend giving it a try too.
Drinking here can get pricey; i usually only drink here during happy hour when things are cheap.  They have a bunch of tv's and offer specials during MNF too."}
{"text":"Owned by former Phoenix Suns star Dan Majerle, Majerle's is great if you're here on a game night, even if you're not a huge sports fan. And if you're not a huge sports fan there's a good chance the person sitting next to you is someone well known in some sports league or another (you know, NBA, MLB, something like that).

I came here with a friend from out of town one night. Some college basketball game was on tv. As we enjoyed our beers and caught up on life, my friend laughed and said, \"This place seems to be popular with aging frat boys.\" I asked him what made him say that, and he pointed to some guy sitting across the bar from us. It was Dan Majerle."}
{"text":"Our first visit was shortly after the place opened, and we were pretty happy about this (sad to lose Wolfleys though) since we love the downtown location. I ordered the chicken finger/fries appetizer as my meal. The food came fast and was dropped off so quickly we could not ask for ranch. My fries were cold, so we caught another servers attention and they went to get new fries. Then found that the chicken. Was cold also. Fresh fries arrived, then our server went to get hot chicken. By the time the very hot overcomes chicken arrives, the fries were warm. Hubby ordered teriyaki chicken and rice and was not impressed. Second chance tonight...walked in, sat at a high top. And sat. And sat. When service arrived we asked for a beer list and she said sure, and went to go serve another table. Buh bye Majerles, hello Yardhouse."}
{"text":"Went to Majerle's for the first time and they made a great impression. The staff was attentive and helpful and the food was really good. I had the Ruben sandwich and was one of the best I have had. Wifey had the chicken sandwich and was impressed. Plus the walls are lined with HD TV's so you can see the game no matter where you sit. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"First and last time there. My dads coffee was cold and bitter. Waitress brought another one but same problem. His French Dip was so stringy and chewy he couldn't eat it. My hamburger was so dry.  Well, you win some and lose some. This was a bust."}
{"text":"Worst Majerle's restaurant I have ever been too! Manager discriminated against me and my boyfriend for bringing in our shopping bags and take out food. He insisted and told us to leave while we already ordered our food."}
{"text":"Yes, Marjele's has made it to Old Town. Yes, this is the same Marjele's that you have probably been to before a sporting event in Downtown Phoenix, but this is Marjele's with the Old Town twist. That means, this is Marjele's; Scottsdale edition. However, so far it's doing pretty good in my book! 

Old Town lacks good sports bars and the ones they have fill up within 20 minutes on the day or night of a big game. So with that, I was pleased to hear that Marjele's gave us another sports bar option. I visited for the first time several weeks ago. Marjele's might have been open all of three days so we decided to check it out. Prior to going, we called to see if there was a chance they accepted reservations. And guess what? They did! Now, I don't know if this will last forever, but at the time, they took a reservation (I hope it stays like that!) The staffer on the phone was extremely polite and friendly when I talked to them. We arrived as one of the games was ending and before the next one started. The sports bar was jam packed so they didn't have our table yet, but they were extremely apologetic and got us one as soon as the first one opened up. So for that, they get a point for customer service. 

The scene: Considering this is a sports bar, I'm not shocked to say that this place was packed with men. All men. There might have been all of 15 girls in the bar when we were there. I assume this will change over time as girls realize that the ratio is in their favor. There is a nice long patio and then room inside with several tables and high tops, two bars and a standing area. TVs surround the entire bar, just like in the Downtown location. I think this Marjele's is bigger than the Downtown location, but it's a toss up. Now, like I said above, this one is definitely Scottsdaled up. At night, it's dark and \"sceney\" but it's still not bad yet. We'll see how long they keep it as a chill sports bar, especially since it's by PCL and now next door to the new El Hefe. I think this is a good option to watch a game or to visit on a night you want to go out in Old Town. 

The food: thumbs up in my book! This is generic bar food but decent bar food. The wings have a spicy kick to them. For my meal, I got the buffalo chicken wrap. It was tasty and tangy with a twist. The sandwich filled me up and unlike some other sports bars around town, I would be ok with eating here again. But again, remember...this is just sports bar food so don't walk into Marjel's expecting fine dining. Expect beers and fried food and you'll be set. 

So in conclusion, check out Marjele's if you're up for being out in Old Town, you're ok with running into the Old Town crowd, you want to watch a game at a place that will be crowded and social and you want to enjoy some food and drinks along the way...served by friendly staff of course!"}
{"text":"Well I am grateful for Marjeles not only on game days but on Sundays as well! I will be so happy when Downtown Phoenix starts thriving to the point that restaurants decide to open their doors on Sundays (most don't). However, until that hopeful day comes, I will rely on Marjele's to feed me since they are one of the few restaurants who stay open on Sundays. Mareje's provides solid food. Food that you will know what you're getting yourself into before you get there. They also have several TVs and always provide quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Just how long does it take to cook 2 burgers? We ordered 2 burgers, very simple burgers and after more than 30 minutes waiting, the server came to us saying \"your food is coming!\" After 15 more minutes, we decided to leave. I am honest and I wanted to pay for the 2 beers... 10 minutes to get the change! The server came to me \"Why didn't you wait 5 more minutes? Your food was ready...\" Yeah right. The manager? Obviously more preoccupied to make the pretty servers laugh... Pathetic and unprofessional."}
{"text":"The once fun and frolicking place has gone missing. Poor service, limited menu items and wings without veggies. Ask the servers ,,, they said, I just do as I am told. No more for me."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service.  We were quickly seated and orders were taken.  We waited over 40 minutes for our food (burgers and fries!) and not once did the waitress check on us or refill our drinks.  She issued a very insincere apology for the wait when she finally did show up.  When my husband asked for the bill, she slammed it on the table and said something rude.  Not one of us understood what she said, but her tone was clear.  The food was just okay - and it was all cold when we received it.  When we left, there were 3 people at the door, and not one spoke to us when we left!  We won't be back - far too many amazing restaurants around with fantastic service and food to bother with the wait and rude staff at Marjerle's."}
{"text":"Uber cool place . - youngish feisty crowd ...

Super dee duper strong drinks ,Decent food and plenty of TV's to get your game on.

clean ,good service ...good location 

Strong drinks ....'nuff said !

go have some fun! ( you will )"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! I don't eat red meat and they made me a special chicken burger with cajun avocado!! So fulfilling!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the food. The bar itself is a little too rowdy for me, but I'm not into sports bars. I had the slam dunk shrimp and I am smitten, who thought to put buffalo wing sauce on tempura shrimp?!?!? It's out of this world. I also got a kids quesadilla with fries and it was ok. The shrimp were the real superstars. As a vegetarian, I will definitely be back for these guys."}
{"text":"was there for week one of the NFL and it wasn't as crowded as i thought it would be.  maybe it was because AZ played monday night.  we were able to get a table right away.  decent amount of tv flat screens everywhere.  good selection of food and drinks.  located in close proximity to US Airways Center and Chase Field."}
{"text":"This place has amazing cheap drinks on happy hour and amazing fries. Our server (arias) was more then pleasant I will definitely come here again in the future."}
{"text":"We were watching the President speak and the TVs were all changed away from the President speaking on terrorism. This is the last meal we will ever have at any of his places. Rude, bullshit, unAmerican."}
{"text":"The food is good, the  mugs are cold. Fast,  excellent,  courteous service. I've enjoyed the tenderloin sliders and the fajita wrap. Excellent location  centrally located. They usually have celebrities on Thursdays during football season. Real casual and laid back."}
{"text":"Great service. Waitress was very attentive. Loved the ground beef nachos. Burger tasted fresh. Be back!"}
{"text":"The only good part of this place was the welcoming hostess. after the waiting staff and managerial staff, the waitresses were horrible. I felt disrespected and unwelcomed once I entered the door. Managers were very disgruntled and unhelpful... Anissa and Amy's skills should be in question. As a military service member I have never felt more disrespected when visiting an establishment. I will never talk positive about this bar and grill."}
{"text":"Prices pretty high for quality of food. But my question is who allows a child to sit at the bar????"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the ambiance with more tv's than Wolfleys but food is basic and hasn't changed.  The service was the highlight here with former bartender of previous place taking great care and giving great hospitality as always.  While we were there we noticed the restrooms were an afterthought and attention to detail seemed to be lackluster.  This is a local place and we want to have a place we can support locally and we only hope the attention to basic things is addressed."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place considering it's a well known local place, but oh my god!  What a disappointment.  The TV set up is awful, who uses projectors anymore?  The food was ok, but the service was non existent.  Ordered a drink, then food when the waitress brought out the drink.  I ordered a burger, because it's hard to screw up...it was slightly burned on the edges.  No napkins or silverware.  No condiments.  Not checking back until 15-20 minutes later to see if anything is missing like napkins or condiments.  Horrible service, maybe the bar is better.  This place gets two stars because the bus boy was more around and brought me a refill when requested, and the wifi works.  Just another desert ridge business that will go out of business sooner or later if things don't improve."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Majerle's several years ago.  I am a huge Suns fan, and we usually eat dinner near the arena before games.   Needless to say I was so disappointed. The food was not great and while we were eating a HUGE roach went crawling up the brick wall next to our table.  I couldn't finish my dinner and I hightailed it outa there!!! Never ever been back!!!"}
{"text":"We watched a game here. Good service and apps were decent. They have Guinness on tap and served it in 12 oz hard plastic cups. Very strange. 

Good place to watch a game. Good atmosphere. Get some Guinness glasses, though."}
{"text":"We tried the pizza for the first time on our visit last weekend and it was  REALLY greasy, like dripping off the slice.  They also screwed up what was supposed to be a private room for our alumni group and gave half of it away...  The UFC fight they were getting crowds for also slowed service significantly.

Still, loads of TVs, the waitress was friendly and competent when she was around, and our booth was comfy."}
{"text":"I've never been to Majerle's before a game, so this is purely a review based on numerous weekday lunch experiences. First I totally agree with previous reviews that complain about the location of the TVs. They are in such awkward spots and are only tuned to like two different things, which is semi-annoying. However I can't complain too much when one of them is tuned to Sportscenter which is all I really need as I eat my lunch. My major complaint about Majerle's is that it is a very awkward space. There is a hostess stand out front on the sidewalk but no one is ever there, so you have to walk in and then BAM you are like on top of the bar. So you're in the way while waiting for a hostess which I hate.

Other than that main complaint, I'm not going to hate too much on the food. It's a freaking sports bar. They serve sports bar food. I am not expecting five star cuisine...I just fried goodness that will clog up my ateries and beer on tap. If they have a salad or two so I can feel better about myself, great. For the most part everything I have tried has been good, including the potato skins, grilled chicken caesar wrap, fried chicken salad, kids grilled cheese meal (hey I wasn't hungry that day!) and the house salad. The french fries are really good especially dipped in ranch. The only thing I didn't really like that I have tried has been the chicken tenders. Something about them was just a bit off to me.  Prices are decent considering the proximity to US Airways Arena and Chase Field.

Overall a good lunch spot to grab a beer and get my sports fix, but not somewhere that warrants a special trip. I'll have to check it out before a game sometime to get the full effect."}
{"text":"Nice local place.  Good food, attentive staff, decent beer selection, and plenty of TVs for sports viewing.  Mama Majerle burger & fish tacos are both excellent.  I'll be back... again."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Probably one of your better bets if you're meeting someone for lunch(it's down Phoenix after all!) The atmosphere is lively enough with every sporting event showing on the multiple tvs. Service was good, and fast and efficient for the lunch crowd.

The menu consists of the usual burgers and sandwiches. My chicken sandwich was dry and uninspired. The one thing that stood out was the chunky bleu cheese dressing. If anything I could maybe find myself back here for a couple off beers and some of that bleu cheese with a side of wings.

Probably fun pre or post game. Otherwise, don't see myself coming back."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhh.  This place was a bright spot in the somewhat shitty ass time I had finding a good place to grab a drink, watch some sports and eat some good food.  This place had all three, not to mention a COMPETENT staff who actually believe the customer is right.  Go figure.  

I stop in across from the conference which had wrapped up earlier.  I ask about drink specials.  The bartender apologized, since she had forgotten what it was, but within a minute she told me it was strawberry vodka lemonade.  Well, that sounds fantastic.  So I had that and a strawberry fields salad, which was this glorious field of greens with strawberries, feta and walnuts, with a strawberry vinaigrette.  Oh, hell yes.  This is what mama needed.

They also understand that hey, we're like five feet away from the local sports arenas, and we're named after a local sports god, let's get some good shit up!  And lo and behold the Rangers playoff game was on.  Well all righty.  No one was moving me at that point.  I also got to try their cheese fries.  It's real cheese, but the fries were just ok.  They were the super skinny fries but the flavoring was good.  

After the shitty time I had with food in this region, this place was awesome and I would just go back SPECIFICALLY for the salad, that's how good it was."}
{"text":"This was my second time at this location. My first time was earlier in the year to watch UFC with friends. All I recall from that visit is that the set up to watch the TV was poor and that we paid entirely too much of a cover to sit in an almost empty establishment.
This time we went for dinner there were 4 adults and 3 children. We sat out on the patio. The server was good.
My biggest complaint from this visit is the food.
1. We ordered one chicken tender for the kids to share and we're brought two. My company didn't want to say anything and these weren't my kids so I kept my mouth shut 
2. Our burgers and sandwiches were brought at the same time but it was almost another 10 minutes beside the other person in our party got their food, boneless wings. Poor form to bring the food out all at different times like that.
3. I got a club sandwhich. It was pretty good. I thought the bread could have been toasted more. But it still wasn't horrible
4. The happy hour specials are few and far between. I love happy hour. But there are only 4 good items included in happy hour and they are the food items no one really wanted. This definitely needs to be looked at for expansion. 
I'm on the fence about this location in general. The one in chandler is pretty good but this one always seems to disappoint me."}
{"text":"Nice place. Corp af, no personality ...basic ass restaurant upsells. Not bad/not good. Prob won't go out of my to come back. Food is good but pricey and basic."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Built from the ground up, it's nice and fresh and clean.  Plenty of seats at the bar, lot's of TVs and the doors and windows all open up to the outside when the weather's nice.

I had the turkey rueben with fries for lunch.  It was made on toasted marble rye bread and was very tasty, indeed.  The bartender, Dawn, was great and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner at Deaert Ridge. Notable difference was that the TENDERLOIN sliders were definitely NOT tenderloin but another(not bad) type of steak. Not nice to misrepresent menu. We have been there many times so change was noticeable"}
{"text":"It shouldn't take 25-30 minutes to get a darn vodka and sprite. Took longer than that when I inquired about food. I can't say I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came in with my family and asked to sit outside from the girl inside. Told her I needed menus for 3 adults, 1 kid, and 1 high chair. After going outside no help came and we sat outside for some time. I went back inside and reminded the girl seating folks that we needed assistance and she promptly came out and practically through the menus at us and did not bring a high chair. We decided to leave and as we were walking away, she brought out the high chair and I told her we were leaving since nobody wanted to help us, and she walked back in and slammed the door on us.  Majerle's just lost our business for good!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after watching my Pirates beat the Diamondbacks on a weekend trip to Phoenix. We were looking for a place close to the hotel that had typical bar food and cold drinks. 

The drinks were cold, the waitress was friendly, the atmosphere was good, and the Reuben I ordered was delicious. The lady ordered a burger which I tasted and it was also very good.

Nothing fancy. No frills. Just good pub grub and booze."}
{"text":"I went there tonight before the Suns vs. Rockets. We sat outside to watch the street crowd which was nice. The waitress took 8 mins to come and take out to even take our water order. So when she came I asked her if they had Happy Hour she said they don't have happy hour on game day. Boooooo for that.  So I ordered the Rojo chicken sandwich with mozz. Cheese with a side salad. My husband ordered a All American cheese burger with fries.

So the food came out promptly but the chicken was some thin piece of processed meat with this huge piece mozzarella cheese on it dry toasted bread with two slices of tomatoes and some dry lettuce.  My husbands burger came out dry as hell. He had to ask for mustard and mayo on the side. Terrible the waitress didn't let us know it was a dry dull burger with nothing but meat and bread. With shoestring fries the few that there were.  I then had to ask for ranch and pickles for the fakechicken sandwich. 

The service was the worst I've seen in a long time. First of all the place was packed with basketball fans trying to make the start of the game. So I had to ask the hostess to take my watered down long island back and bring a bud light. Then I had to call the hostess to take the money so that we could pay and leave. She hardly checked on us outside and she knew we were sort of rushing to walk two blocks to see the beginning of the game. I only tipped $5 that was courtesy of my husband because I would have left like $2. Sorry,I'm usually a descent tipper but she was pretty awful.

I would never go back the food quality was poor and the service was even worse. Go to Hooters for a fantastic buffalo chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"The food is bland and way too expensive. You would be better off eating on an airplane!

The only reason I didn't give it a one star is that the interior decor was well done."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Great sports bar. Lots of TVs. Lots of different games. Food was very good Service was excellent. The wait staff very friendly. Halley was great. Thanks for an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"Oh what a delightful surprise! This is a great sports bar with wonderful food and service! Try the tenderloin sliders...yummy!  Their wings are definately the best in town....crispy and sauced to perfection. Service was attentive (Amy did a great job) and hands on management out in the restaurant talking to customers. The kitchen handles the hungry crowd without any apparent glitch serving high quality, tasty hot food. Just an all round great experience. We will be spending Suns nights there alot this season."}
{"text":"You know, this was just OK in every single aspect.  

They have a very so so menu out side the appetizers.  I have been to the Phoenix location over and over getting drinks and appetizers.  It has always been good for that, but what a disappointment.  I was there with a group of 6.  Nothing came out warm except the last plate that was special order.  I had to ask over and over to get service and the food was not good.   Visiting the dark color bar during the day time was like seeing being at Disneyland while it was closed, dirty and empty.  Really just made for drinking, not eating there.  It would be 1 start, but they do have a ton of TV's and the appetizers are not bad."}
{"text":"Website is super outdated.  We chose this venue as our monthly girls night out because the website said it had live music on Wednesday's.  Our server said that hasn't happened in a long time.  Website also said trivia is on Thursdays and guess what? It's on Tuesday's.  

There only seemed to be one server working the whole floor so she was super busy (It was 7:30 pm)  I ordered boneless wings and they were cold and not very good at all :(  

Not very many choices for those who are eating Gluten free.  We probably won't be back.  We weren't impressed, even with the drinks."}
{"text":"Back to majerles!!! I love this place. The time I ordered the Rojo Diablo sandwich. It was delish ! Our server Dani Was the best !!! Very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Went for drinks with some friends and really did not take advantage of the sports aspect of this sports bar.  The bar has a great vibe.  The staff was friendly and service was fair.  I say fair because of the speed of service.  You can't expect immediate service at a bar on a Saturday night in Old Town, but for the size of the bar, there should have been more than 2 bartenders.  There is a lot of seating inside and out.  And, even though it is loud and was busy, you feel like you can relax and enjoy yourself.  You don't have to deal with the \"rowdiness\" of a bar with a dance floor.  Overall?  I would say that Majerle's is worth a stop in."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever.  Party of 13. One of our group never received his meal.  Drinks never refilled. Server basically ignored us. And the food was mediocre at best. Fries cold and burgers overcooked. How long does it take to get a taco salad? Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"I can't seem to understand 'why' many people rate this as a first-class sports bar because in actuality, its one of the worst I've ever been in, and I grew up going to the sports books in Juarez, Mexico where their idea of a flat screen was a gabacho thumping the TV onto the sticky tile floor and looking cross at an hombre could get your eye cut out and fed to you as the special of the day.

Yes, Majerle's is worse.  

Okay, well, no one in Thunder Dan's is gonna devour your soul, but the place makes me feel like I'm sharing a pint with Florentines Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi and Ciappo Ubriachi in Dante's inner ring of the seventh circle of Hell.

The set up is terrible.  The TVs are difficult to see from EVERYWHERE in the bar and they have it arranged so that if you are fortunate enough to view up to TWO SCREENS (!) at one time, they are both showing the same game.  This is a problem during major events like the NCAA tournament or bowl games.  

Moreover, i would be kitten-hearted to ask a manager to change their programming to another game i'd rather watch.  

The bar is always crowded, which makes it even more wondrous for me when i actually go in there and wait for a seat just to encounter no beer specials and terrible food.

I wonder how large the bowl of crack the editors at Sports Illustrated were smoking to rate this anywhere near the top 1,000 sports bars in the US."}
{"text":"We have a group of 6. Everyone got their meals except for me. I wanted to see if the waiter was going back to get my meal, but he never came back. After 5mins, one of my friend had to go to get the waiter. My meal was not put in the system. He never came to apologize. When everyone was more than 1/2 way finished with their meals, out come mine. The Chicken Cordon Blu was good, but the service from the waiter was terrible."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere always super positive staff. Going great customer service is a must in this day and age and they know it! Tons of TVs like seriously like 30+ so great for watching the game haha! Beer specials as expected and try the diablo chicken sandwich it was great!"}
{"text":"This is a fun high end sports bar for an older crowd. It's not super noisy but still has a lot  of tv's. The booths are pretty big so you're not cramped when trying to eat or visit. 

They offer a large variety of appetizers. The chips and salsa were good but beware of the salsa. It is super spicy. The pretzels weren't my favorite. I went with the pork sandwich. It was okay. It just needed more sauce. I had a hard time choosing something from the menu. Nothing really stood out to me. That is why I finally chose the pulled pork sandwich. Their fries are the skinny ones which I like. 

However the names of the dishes were cool. They have a sports theme. I would come back again but more for the drinks and not to eat."}
{"text":"This is my favorite joint for pretty good wings. They have the Gorilla Wings which comes with several options for flavors. Unlike Wingstop, This place has the Option of Crisper wings. 

Order the Chili Pepper Garlic wings..So good, too good.

The waitress' name is Brittney. She's really helpful in suggesting good mid-day snacks if you are around the area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here with a group to watch Oklahoma Thunder vs GSW game 6.  We were seated immediately - TVs everywhere and the sound for the game was on.  Great happy hour apps and drink selections.  Clean bathrooms.  The TVs hanging on the far ends of the bar could be bigger - hard to see - but the TVs and screens on the side walls were good size. Would recommend this place to friends and will be back again."}
{"text":"Staff pleasant and food good have never seen this place booming really but always a decent stop."}
{"text":"If uou like watching sports with driends and xrazy people watching ... Shut up and get here!"}
{"text":"For some reason, service in AZ wasn't quite what I'm used to in CO. At Majerle's, the waitress basically sauntered over and asked us \"Whatdoyouwant?\" Then proceeded to get our order wrong (beef burgers instead of veggie burgers).  Taken together, it seems like an indication that they didn't much care.  So I'm glad I'm back in the Vail Valley, where we all care about each other :-)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere, glad to have one in my neighborhood finally.  Cottons Club or Mama Majerles are a must."}
{"text":"Great strawberry chicken salad best dressing ever. Music a little loud but we were under the speaker. Overall a really good experience."}
{"text":"Here from out of town to watch my hawks win a repeat and the folks at majerles have been nothing short of fabulous. We came at 2 for lunch knowing the whole establishment was reserved for the game, however since we were unable to get tickets at the asinine ticket prices we opted to try and stay for the game. Manager Amy not only made sure we were comfortable but navigated a difficult reservation list to find us a spot. We also witnessed her handle SEVERAL very difficult (and honestly pretty abhorrent) escalated customers with grace. Food was excellent, daliahs Bloody Mary is out of this world, and the menu is versatile enough for even the pickiest 12th man. Thanks for making our SB49 experience that much better, y'all."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. Very attentive service. Good steak sliders. I liked the atmosphere. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cuban sandwich and couldn't even finish half of this flop of a dish, it looked good unfortunately the same can not be said about the taste, the main ingredient-pork- was old and tasted as such. Service was not very good, just eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch while at a trade show at the convention center. 
Great, convenient location. 
Service was great, and the food was good."}
{"text":"Disappointed!  First time trying Majerle's at Desert Ridge on Sunday.  So we sat down, ordered drinks, and I went to the ladies room.  OMG!  It was filthy, toilets not flushed, and the stall I chose, the toilet paper holder was broken and hanging by a thread, you couldn't get any paper out.  So, the 3 of us ordered our lunch.  I got a Salad with chicken and asked for blue cheese dressing.  When the salad came, no dressing, asked again.  Then, she brought me tartar sauce!  I got her attention and my husband at this point was livid and asked for the manager.  The manager, ERIC, came to our booth and proceeded to ARGUE with us saying that they make their own blue cheese dressing and use mayonnaise - I said - here, try it, that is tartar sauce.  He wouldn't do it.  I then said, \"the women's restrooms need cleaning and the first stall toilet paper holder is broken.\"   Are you ready?  The manager, ERIC, WALKS AWAY!  No I'm sorry.  Nothing!  Don't waste your time or money on this place.  It needs to be closed."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here after the Suns vs Cavs game. I had the gorilla wings with chili pepper garlic sauce. The wings were crispy and the sauce was sort of like an Asian zing from BWW. Hubby had a Mac and cheese burger which he enjoyed. Quick walk from Talking Stick Arena. Bar was fine. I had a pomegranate margarita and hubby a draft. Our waitress was non attentive but whatevs! It was good for what it was!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous expensive drink prices...$16 for a double tall vodka soda. The manager is an A$$. Flip side...cute cocktail waitresses."}
{"text":"I live a block away from this place. Given it a couple try's but have to find a new option. Went in to watch Game 6 of the World Series. 3rd time ordering food and will be my last. Boneless wings I don't even think were cooked and nachos were a soggy mess. The place is huge, has no shortage of TVs (even on the dog-friendly patio), good staff but needs A LOT of work in the kitchen."}
{"text":"If you stop serving food before you close, post that on your website.  Don't let people walk all the way there and think you are open until 2am with full service"}
{"text":"Walking into the place, I thought it was purely a bar. To my surprise, there is a whole other back of this restaurant with plenty of seating. Fortunately, we ate there before the Diamondbacks game finished so we were the only ones in the dining area. This may not seem major, but they had the best shoe string fries! My brother ordered the teriyaki chicken and he thoroughly enjoyed it, especially the vegetables that came with it. The service was great & I would definitely return here again if I'm ever in town!"}
{"text":"One star. If even. Here on a rather slow Friday night, Chandler location.  Food terrible. No liquor in the happy hour drinks.  Had to send them back but more of the same. I will say our waitress was sympathetic so we will take care of her tip.  First time here but sadly will never return."}
{"text":"Used to love this place about 3-4 years ago.. It was literally my Sunday go to to watch football games and get a bite to eat. I recently went there an apparently the management has changed quite a bit, the food takes forever the wait staff does not seem to care and take forever to get your food order and your drink order. The staff doesn't seem to care and quite honestly I could go anywhere else in Scottsdale and watch the same games and get better service. Definitely not coming back here."}
{"text":"My coworker raved about this Jalapeno Chili Burger she got here, so we decided this is where will go for lunch. We got there about 1135am, were seated quickly and it was already starting to fill up.

I love that they don't mind seperate checks because there was 4 of us. I got the Jalapeno Chili Burger with sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were delicious! Not hot but warm. The burger had no sauce whatsoever on it, we had to ask for mustard and mayo. I had one skinny chili inside my burger, boo! I barely even tasted the chili. There was WAY to much bun for this burger...and I wasn't the only one who thought so. I just ate my burger with one side of a bun, my coworker was just peeling off chunks of bread from her's.

Another coworker got this tuna crossiant sandwhich...next time I'll try that. She didn't like the swiss cheese that was on it but said it was very delicious. As we left the place was packed! Well inside, they had a few patio tables, but who wants to sit outside - its hot AND windy that day."}
{"text":"Prepare for 360° of happiness... especially if you love basketball or sports in general. Seriously, there are so many TV's in here that I'm surprised the hostess did not hand us a remote when we said we'd sit at the bar. 

The discerning and experienced Sport Bar patron knows what they need in a Sport Bar. This is where to get it. All of it. From top to bottom it's obvious the Majerle's crew care about what they are doing.

Strap in...

Saturday afternoon, we made ourselves at home at the bar. Marissa, our bartender/server, greeted us.  Thus, began one of the best customer service and dining experiences in recent memory. And I really needed it. Throughout the whole visit, Marissa was gracefully quick, friendly, and obviously concerned we were satisfied customers. She glided with ease among us and a couple large sets of obvious regulars all cheering a college basketball game. It was fun. We were pulled in and involved.

If you are in a hurry skip the next self-serving paragraph of nostalgic digression.

My wife and I are huge Suns fans... HUGE. Back in the day we shared season tickets with friends, 6th row baby! And we love Thunder Dan EmEffin Majerle. 'Bout 3 years ago we dropped our tickets in frustration with the Suns ownership. [Its blatantly lack-luster and uncommitted approach to building competitive team had gone on far too long, 7 mediocre years too long. We're still out here Robert Sarver. When you invest and build a product around which the valley and state can rally, we'll be back. Either invest or as the recent billboards suggest, STEP DOWN.] If you are still with me here, my point to this paragraph is: Darcie and I are no strangers to Majerle's Sports Grill. We have eaten dozens of times at the location near the Suns arena. And most of that tasty business was conducted pre-Yelp. So, we knows our Majerle'sSG, and we knows what we like. Strangely, this Saturday was our first visit to the Chandler location. My favorite bit of Majerle-related nostalgia is at the end of this review.

We got wings, slam dunk shrimp, and a #9 burger. We asked for the wings extra-crispy and the #9 burger medium. Everything was perfect, but I have to call out the Slam Dunk Shrimp... it was astonishing, cooked to absolute perfection of doneness. I wanted to place a 2nd order, it was THAT amazing (but they woulda hadta roll me outa there). And the burger had that signature top-shelf flavor we've come to expect from Majerle's over decades of patronage. Wings were on point. With a side of medium buffalo sauce and a side of extra hot, we made short work of the entire affair. 

Friends and neighbors, I have to tell ya: Hearts, minds, and taste buds soared that day.

I had flown home the previous night from a 2-week business trip in Bellevue Washington. I was in desperate need of an easy, relaxing, happy, and most of all, re-energizing experience. Majerle's & Marissa hit dead center in the Bullseye for me. Thank you!

Stop in for great eats, friendly service, and a boost to whatever type of day you're having. Thank me later.

Here's that final and favorite bit of Majerle-related nostalgia I promised.

Serval years ago Jerry Colangelo told all of us that Dan Majerle would be coaching the Grand Canyon men's basketball team. We celebrated Dan's good fortune. It's always great to hear from Jerry. We miss him. Please come back Jerry. Anyway... My daughter has played basketball in just about every gym in the valley. One of her final regular season games for Highland High in her senior year was against Camelback High School. Over the previous 8 years of basketball, we had never been to the Camelback gym. So, when my wife and I pulled into the Camelback parking lot, in our white Ford Explorer, we didn't know which direction to walk to the gym. Guess who I saw walking about fifty feet from us? I rolled the window down and shouted at the top of my lungs: \"Hey #9! Where's the gym?\" I startled him a bit, but he turned, smiled big and pointed. I know my face was beaming as I thanked him with: \"Love ya baby.\" His smile got even bigger. He looked at the guy he was walking with, shrugged, and shook his grinning head. The guy clapped him on the back a few times and gave me a thumbs up. Great prelude to watching my daughter and Highland beat down Camelback. 

I have no doubt that the Phoenix Suns, including, of course, Thunder Dan, imbued the family basketball love and passion that eventually led to my daughter's D1 scholarship. Thank you basketball."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential but it's inconsistent customer service prevents it from being a top notch joint.  We come here every weekend to watch college football games.  The food is decent for a sports bar.  Over the course of the season I've had:

Gorilla Wings - $9

Basket of Fries - $3.50

Fully Loaded Pizza (Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Green Peppers, Mushrooms, Onions, Black Olives, Mozzarella, Parmesan and Cheddar) - $12

Italian Panini - Genoa Salami, Pepperoni, Ham, Provolone, Tomatoes, Lettuce, Vinaigrette, on Sourdough Bread) - $9.50

Buffalo Chicken Wrap - $9.50

Chicken Quesadilla - $9.50

Yes, the prices are a bit high...but you're in Old Town Scottsdale, where prices are high everywhere.  During the football season, pints of domestic draft Beer are cheap so it makes up for the food pricing.

The food quality is mediocre.  By far my favorite items are the Italian Panini and the Gorilla Wings served with Maniac Sauce, which is pretty hot.  The Chicken Quesadilla is ~meh~, a bit soggy and doesn't have much flavor.

Where they really fall short is their inconsistent service.  When they're not busy (during ASU home games) the service is great.  However, when they're busy (ASU road games) the staff is overloaded and can't handle large crowds.  I think it's because they hire young, inexperienced kids who have an attitude.  On at least 3 occasions I've been told \"I'm real busy right now, I'll come get your order when I can\" or \"I don't know, ask someone else, too busy right now\"....come on!

They'll never change because being in Old Town, they'll always have the business and don't have to worry about repeat, loyal customers.  If my friends didn't come here every week, we wouldn't come here as often as we do.

{"text":"Majerle's was the place me and my friends decided to go after we were told that a nearby restaurant had a 1.5 hour wait. Fortunately, we were seated right away but our waitress was rarely to be seen. I ordered the cucumber mule, Madison Skins and the Jalapeño burger. The food took forever to get to us. My friend ordered chips and salsa and that took close to 15 minutes to get to our table. Chips and salsa!!! Despite the lack of service, the food was fine. General bar food. Probably wouldn't be back."}

{"text":"Very good place for work events.  Dog friendly very clean and private areas.  Dark atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was average. We had a quesadilla and a burger. Quesadilla was good, burger wasnt great. Not much flavor and a dry bun. The reason for the low rating vs average was because of 2 things. One of the waiters dropped a cup that had the liquid flying all over us. She looked at us and didnt say a thing and acted like nothing happened. Second, the lady at the bar was serving beers that she wiped the glasses with her hand becase she was overpooring and spilling on the outside of the glass. That is just gross."}

Ended up having to go up to the bar to get a drink, if you are a female, good luck... You will be waiting, Sent my boyfriend up to get a drink instead and still was a wait.. But not as bad.. Food finally comes, didn't have silverware, flagged down a bar back, who was VERY nice, brought silverware and told us to enjoy our meal, check finally comes, and all the prices were wrong, soda says 3.00 on the menu, check says 3.50, burger on the menu says 12.00 check said 13.00 and cup of soup was 4.00 and gave the option to add a side salad for 2.00 and check came it was 3.50, you would think for a corporate place they would have it more together...

{"text":"majerle's is our downtown pre-event standby. tuesday night's atmosphere was notably fun - seriously. the staff was all decked out in halloween costumes and the mood was really energetic. it was a nice recovery from the tom's tavern disappointment 30 minutes earlier.

we shared a pile of wings. he drank beer and i was drinking my new standard, a vodka tonic with 1/2 club soda. an obnoxious drink? sure. but so what? our absolutely awesome server didn't show the slightest bit of annoyance toward me or my drink order.  she was genuinely sweet. i appreciate that. as far as the food and drink, our wings were hot, as requested, slightly breaded, tasty and served quickly. our server was on the ball, bringing a new beer almost immediately after he finished the previous one. awesome! this location is consistently good, quick and friendly. and that makes me happy."}
{"text":"Never had any real luck with this place and I've been to a few of them through out the valley. Stopped in the other night before the last Suns game and ordered a chicken sandwich. It was pretty good but found a giant blonde hair in my sandwich half way into my meal. I thought it was a long string of cheese, but when the cheese didn't breakaway, I knew I had a problem. They were very apologetic and took it off the bill."}
{"text":"We were downtown for the game and decided to go here. The ambience is great it has candles on the table allowing for a cool date night and has a bar area for those who come just for fun. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The waitress presented sauce choices so we can try them and choose. We ordered: the Slam Dunk Shrimp no sauce dipping on side. The shrimp tempura crust was perfect but shrimp inside was very much over cooked and flavorless. Sauce for dipping didn't help the shrimp. Hubby ordered the chicken sandwich w/ mild sauce. The sandwich was nicely made but sauce was over powering. We also got salad and fries. Both were delicious. We ordered a Blue Hawaiian and a Raspberry Lemon Drop. Both were good. Overall, we would probably come back for drinks and fries or maybe try another dish. **They gave military discount which is always kind **"}
{"text":"Fried chicken salad was really good. Good service. Only four stars because we made reservations well in advance and she asked if we wanted a booth. I said no, a table. Arrived on time and it was packed...and they had saved us a booth.  Kind of pricey, though, unless you get the happy-hour specials. And there were families with kids in there; little kids, so it's ok to bring your family."}

{"text":"I held an event here last evening for work and they did a stellar job! They were VERY accommodating. Claudia, our server, was the B-O-M-B!...so sweet, so helpful, so attentive...she takes great pride in what she does and it was appreciated. 
As a group, we ordered MANY appetizer from HH menu. ALL very good. Cheese curds were the best I've ever had. Great boneless wings...heard raves about street tacos and pretzel bites too. And the cocktails were right on par too...Claudia did her best to accommodate a skinny margarita and it was spot on. Others were very happy with their drink selection as well. 
We were pleasantly surprised by an in-house DJ for Fri evening activities...really good music. Not too loud either...total bonus! 
Although I don't live too close to this location, I will try the Scottsdale location, from this experience."}
{"text":"My husband likes Majerle's because it's nostalgic for him.  He grew up when Thunder Dan played for the Suns.  We keep coming here because we like the food and the atmosphere. 

Yes, it's a sports bar.  If we can't be at the game, my husband wants to be in a sports bar watching the game. So we go to Majerle's.  

We've never had bad service of all the times we've been here.  We came here during a Suns game one night, with the intention of watching the game, and since it was a big game I remember the service being slower than at other times but I didn't really care because we intended to be there a while anyway.  

I've never had to ask for a refill of my water.  Our order has always been correct.  (My husband and I are notorious for substitutions.)  The hostess and waitresses are always friendly too."}
{"text":"Good spot right in the central old town / downtown area to watch sports. 20+ TV's showing all different games. Wings are good too. Bartenders are real nice.

The slight problems are somewhat ample though:
- Some TV's aren't HD
- Drinks are pretty weak
- No IPA's at all (bottled/draft), that sucks
- Not much in the way of Dan Majerle or the Suns memorabilia/feel. It has one signed Majerle jersey, but could really use the orange purple theme or more facts/photos/things about his life / the Suns in general. Was wishing there was more.
- We arrived at 530pm and parked right in front of the sports bar and in the hostess' sight. We missed the sign that says no parking after 6pm (our fault), but wish the hostess would have told everyone that they were going to get a ticket (we did).. you'd think that would be a nice touch considering they can see the cars and patrons inside
- Some waiters told us it was first come, first serve table seating... others told us to talk to the hosts to put our names down... get your policies in order, should be really simple.

Minus the ticket, I'd give it 3 stars. The sign is our fault, but considering 4 other cars got tickets and everyone was inside watching sports, I'm sure it happens a ton and the host can do a quick announcement to move the cars."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour and had a couple beers and gorilla wings.  Pros: the wings were big and delicious, and they have a decent beer selection (domestics, Guiness, Four Peaks) Cons: Its a little bit cramped"}
{"text":"Idk why you can't give zero stars. Our experience here was terrible. We purchased a table with. Little service which entailed 2 bottles of our choice for $250 each . Fine whatever, I paid it. Shortly after that they brought the bottles and proceeded to lock the bottles and walk away. As we asked for them to pour one drink atleast for each person of our party they denied this request. So after realizing I was paying for something I was unable to ultimately use I went to talk to the manager. As soon as I expressed my discomforts with the situation his Napoleon complex must have kicked in and he called for his \"GOONS\" to kick me out. I hate giving negative reviews but that short, beaded eyed, power hungry, wanna be DJ, so called manager, completely ruined me and my whole families experience."}
{"text":"I go to Majerle's when I have an event downtown or waiting for a concert to start at US Airways. The martini selection is great! The cucumber martini is so refreshing. It's not on the menu, but if you ask, they will make it for you. They also have daily drink specials. Last time I went, it was $4 long islands. What a deal! 

The best appetizer is the buffalo shrimp. The shrimp are butterflied, slightly breaded and fried. The crunch on the shrimp is amazing. And then they are coated with just the right amount of buffalo sauce. The only downside is that you only get about 6 to an order. The loaded potato skins are very good also."}
{"text":"They hosted a Clemson party for the Fiesta Bowl. They were absolutely slammed and the staff was great. Our server was awesome, I wish I could remember her name, would request her again if I remembered her name. Didn't try any food as we ate before we got there, but drinks were awesome and the entire staff was great."}
{"text":"This is a great place for out-of-towners to catch their sports teams in action. Bar selection was great. Friendly servers are all attentive and very good for menu recommendations. Thoroughly enjoyed myself, even though my team winning that night probably helped my mood. :-)"}
{"text":"As soon as the hostess saw us coming , she kindly opened the door for me & my wife! That was a great touch. 
Also, our server was very nice and friendly. Overall all the service we recieved was top class and really had a family feel to it. You can tell the staff is kept happy and thats important and good to see.

The food was great! Good sized salads and the tenderloin sliders appetizer is seriously the best thing ever! I love going to a bar and grabbing some filet sliders w/ garlic aioli and au jus sauce with a beer!

Everything was good. Water kept full. Clean bathrooms. 

Overall very happy we decided to eat there and will be back whenever we are in the state of AZ again.

{"text":"With a fun and upbeat bar area, this place is located in downtown Phoenix, close to the US Airways Center. It seemed that the family area was completely separated from the bar area, which I liked. 
They have plenty of seating but It can get very busy there on a game night. Also, parking can be a problem if you are just there for dinner and drinks. I didn't think of that and ended up paying $10 for parking. 
I ordered the Long Island Iced Tea, it was very potent and tasted great, just the way it the LIIT should taste. My husband got the wings, which I didn't try but he seemed impressed. I got the fish tacos, and they were very good. The cilantro sauce that came with it was  a little thick and tasted more like ranch, but the salsa was ok. 
All in all, I had a great time there and the bartenders were all very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"2.57/5 just okay, not particularly compelling.

there aren't many joints in downtown phoenix, popped in here today.

the food selection looked standard, nothing too appealing. i found it odd/disappointing that they didn't do beer by the pitchers, since a whole group of us came by. 

another off thing was that they were playing these old, weird music videos. but it wasn't even in any kind of cool retro way, they were just random music videos that were competing against various sports channels.

also. sangria was weak. it was juice."}
{"text":"This was an awesome spot that we hit after the Suns game last night. It was crowded and lively with games playing on every TV. Our server was sweet and prompt as she seated us and got our drink orders. Although the menu seems to offer typical bar food, the quality was the best we've had in some time. Granted, we were definitely seeking out chicken fingers and potato skins, but they were crispy and delicious. Thanks for the Phoenix hospitality, Majerles!"}
{"text":"The only place that is not a complete mess in Scottsdale! After being slapped in the face by Bottled Blonde and Derby Public House, my friends and I checked this place out and it was such a breath of fresh air! Reasonably priced drinks unlike what the other clubs in Scottsdale charge. I swear, I think those other place water down their booze and then charge you $10 a drink for it. Majerle's has a cool NORMAL crowd. Wasn't too packed, played great music and was a ton of fun. Definitely my favorite place in the area. Nice big bar if you want to chill and watch some sports, then BAM on the other side of the place another bar with a dance floor! Perfect!! My friends and I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I had really bad service at this location.  I went back and forth with the waitress about drink specials when they had it posted on their LCD TV's and flyers in their windows.  I sat with a party of 8 and she served everyone at that table food and at least two drinks before she even looked my way.  It took almost 45 minutes for this lady to get me another drink and didn't happen until I went to the manager to complain about her.  To the owner, please hire more outgoing ladies for waitresses because they look attractive does not mean they have the best attitudes."}
{"text":"We had our reunion meeting at this location and happened to pick a bad night for that, as they were having trivia night and the guy on the mic was a tad LOUD and sitting at a table of 6 we could barely hear the person across from us, so that was our bad I guess for not researching that.

Otherwise, the food was pretty good! I had the Buffalo chicken wrap, it was delicious just really messy and substituted the fries for a side salad. I was a lil disappointed with the side salad. The mix totally looked like one of those cheap iceberg bagged packages but it was alright. 

I washed everything down with a 'dirty pear' aka a snakebite (Guinness and Pear Cider) which indeed was tasty."}
{"text":"This place was real chill last night. I had been to the one in Downtown Phoenix quite a few times before and wasn't all to impressed, but this location is a whole 'nother animal.

Plenty of space to do you.

Something so rare in cramped up tiny Scottsdale. Crowd was alright and the bartenders we're super nice. Might have to swing through the next time I hit up Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour with a friend and was a little unimpressed. The beer was a tad skunky. Had a dos equis on tap and a bud light. Both tasted funny. Ordered the chicken fingers and they seemed not fully cooked. The place is nice, and in a nice area, but wasnt super impressed. The happy hour prices were good, but then again the product was to be deisred."}
{"text":"Interesting night. This review is coming From a non-twenty something. First music- all hip hop all night. Second- drinks were true to order no skimping on content. Third- very diverse crowd. Very diverse. Actually shockingly diverse from a out of state gal.

Thoughts- if you don't like rap all night. Pass on it: if you like loud you'll like. Drinks will give you want you want.


All and all- I should've left at 11:30. It's 1:30 and not the 40 plus crowd scene at all. 

Thanks"}
{"text":"Food was OK..

Beer selection was fair.... If your a craft beer snob like me you won't care for the selection as I didn't

TV selection was good

Bartender...brunette..extremely easy on the eyes.. And she has a personality as well.. Calls you by your name.. That goes a long way for a consumer like me

Overall.. Next time I'm in town I will be back"}
{"text":"Yea a pretty good sports bar.  Nice staff and good wings (been there only once).  There's a front bar and a rear bar for overflow."}
{"text":"Coworker wanted to try this place, and unfortunately I had no idea who Dan Majerle was, but it was neat to come to a former Suns player's sports bar. Located downtown, it has lots of TV's (Suns were playing but losing horribly so the channel was changed). The wine served here was not good, but beers are great, especially the local IPA! Started with chicken nachos which was really good with the fake nacho cheese and real cheese! Lots of toppings.

We all went with burgers and I got Mama Majerle's burger (grilled mushrooms and onions with cheese) and added bacon. The burgers are huge, huge beef patty. I could barely finish it but killed the yummy shoestring fries.

Service was good and ended the trip with a good hefty meal."}
{"text":"The grilled chicken,bacon, avocado and sprouts sandwich with a side of Cesar salad was fantastic! Wish I took a picture before I ate it all"}
{"text":"the sign said to seat yourself.   We did.  Nada. We waited a least 10 minutes while two servers passes by.  As we left, the bartender said, that she hadn'tseen us. Oh well, it was probably an omen for what would have come later."}
{"text":"So I know Abu J. has given me the advice to stop going out with losers, and I have yet to take him up on his advice, but after my latest outing I think I will have to.  I was hanging out at home when I got the call to hang out with this guy for a low key night.  I had to remind him it was Monday Night Football and the NLDS game of Phillies v. Rockies.  So he suggests we hit up Majerle's, which I'm down for because it means more sport watching and less talking.

So I find my way down here, and say screw it to paying for parking.  After the whole $20 to park at Westgate, I'm down to take my chances at getting a parking ticket.  It's ridiculous how much the city makes off of parking, parking tickets, and the ever illustrious DUIs.

Anyways, I go into Majerle's, completely ignored by the hostess out front.  Glad to know she's getting paid $8.50 to not talk to anyone and act pretty...  Settle down at the bar and order a Blue Moon, because it's a Monday, it's football, it's baseball, and I'm preparing for another laborious date.

Halfway through my beer my date arrives.  Which wouldn't be cool, but I need to get good and drunk so I deal.  He automatically decides we need to get wings.  Thanks for deciding...because I have no thoughts of my own.  Apparently him being a gentleman meant he would talk shit on the wings I wanted, then reluctantly give in to getting the boneless buffalo wings.  Which are $5 along with four other appetizers during their 4-8 pm happy hour.  Good deal there!

The wings come out within 15 minutes or so and they look...odd.  It looks like someone sliced tofu and lightly fried them, then dipped them in excessive amounts of sauce.  Definitely not the most appetizing item to look at.  I wished they looked better, because then I wouldn't have the hippie making fun of me the whole time.  They tasted okay, but the look alone was too much of a turn off to enjoy.

The bartender disappeared after we ordered the wings, so we spent some time waiting for her to discover us again so we could order our entree.  Oh how I wished she had taken our order earlier.  I had to listen to the douche hippie talk smack on the Angels and how people die all the time so Adenhart's death didn't matter.  Yeah...that deserved a total smack in the face.  Or complete beat down.  Don't ever hate of my Angels or commit blasphemy against Adenhart.  I will not stand for that, especially if I've had a few drinks in me.

Anyways, so I eventually order the veggie wrap with chicken and he gets the chicken parmesan.  Not too much time passes, so I could enjoy the flat screens and watch the Dolphins show Mark Sanchez how to play a real football game.  The wrap comes, and it's huge!  I enjoyed the fruit salad of pineapple and grapes.  And the actually spinach tortilla and veggies were good, but the chicken just dragged the wrap down.  It was so bland and tasteless.  I wish I would have just gone pure veggie.

I had a couple rounds of beer after that, just to pass the time until the Dolphins could be declared the official winners.  Conversation came and went with the people at the bar, far more interesting than the person I was with.  The beers came and went, and soon it was time to peace out.  When I saw the tab, I was glad I didn't have to pay.  $60+ to \"enjoy\" conversation with a tool and overpriced food and drinks.  Sometimes it's good to be a girl..."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars. Yes, 5 stars! I am not a big fan of watching sports on TV since I love the joy of being at the game, however the energy at this location is better than attending a sporting event. The food is great. I mean \"GREAT\". I have enjoyed everything on the menu I have tasted so far. There is something on the menu for everyone and any type of dietary need. My favorites are the Boneless Wings, Chicken Strips (real white meat), and the Taco Salad. I am surprised the French Fries have not put McDonalds out of business. They are addicting. To top it off the they have top notch service. I have never had a problem, compliant or been disappointed. You can tell the employees love the place that they work out and enjoy to serve the patrons.

My office has had several private parties at this location. They have two areas where you can throw parties. My favorite is the Cotton Room. It is a private room that is very hip, urban, all white with glass mirrors surrounding the room. Kinda like a mini retro dance space. It has plush leather white seating, big screen tv's and a private bar. The resturant does catering and take-out."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a sports bar. Can get pretty crowded before game time as it is a couple of streets from Chase Field (where the Diamondbacks lose...er, play) and America West Arena (or whatever its called this week - where Los Suns play!). The food is pretty good and reasonably priced. 

Sometimes Dan Majerle, owner and former Suns player, will come through. Its fun to watch him grope the female servers (please tip those girls well!). I'd suggest it for smaller games and for nights when there is no game, too busy on game nights to really enjoy."}
{"text":"Hear it has it's good nights and definitely a place to pick up chicks from what I hear but unfortunately for me I have yet to go on the suggested nights. Nice place either way and place that you can people watch and get wasted."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant looking for your standard \"bar food\" so I ordered the chicken fingers and French fries. It was good but nothing worth going crazy over. My biggest complaint with this restaurant was the service. When we arrived, we told the hostess that there 3 of us. She didn't even acknowledge that we had spoken and instead just walked inside expecting us to follow her in. She could have said \"okay follow me right inside.\" How simple would that have been? It just rubbed me the wrong way. Then, we ordered drinks and even though the restaurant wasn't busy, it took a long time to get our drinks. The rest of our experience was just average and I think this place has good potential if the service was better."}
{"text":"Very good food and nice atmosphere. I tried the tenderloin sliders and they were fantastic. My daughter had the kids meal of chicken and fries and she loved the flavor. We also ordered dessert of the chocolate eruption which had cheesecake bites in it. That was worth the calories. :D

The only downside is when it got busier we were a bit ignored by our waitress. Took several tries to get her to come over. Other than that, the entire meal and service was  good."}
{"text":"Convenient location and the food was alright, but nothing special."}
{"text":"It's pretty cool that you guys let your employees get trashed after their lunch shifts! 

Went in yesterday for a happy hour with some friends. The booth behind us seemed to have been heavily drinking since before I sat down. As the night slowly progressed the group got more and more wasted. One guy was Sitting in random booths with people, he came by our table and put his arm around a friend proceeded  to move his hand down her side and into her lady area! Wtf?! The girl in the booth,who I'm pretty sure was an employee, was so drunk she was sitting on every guys lap in her party and it looked like they were all having a pretty good time with her if you know what I mean. Gross. But come on this isn't dos gringos on a Friday night, it was happy hour at 430 in the afternoon. If I had done that at my job I would have been suspended or fired. Oh well good luck Majerle's. I to remember my first beer."}
{"text":"Not on my list for a quick return. Had been several years since my last one, so most likely will not be revisited unless the crew decides it's a must do. Sitting outside is nice but the speakers are annoying. Cut them off or fix them."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time at Majerle's and it will probably be my last. It is just your typical sports bar, nothing special."}
{"text":"I was kind of excited to go here because one of my \"wing friends\" told me they were great here. Well, he forgot to tell me the wings were breaded. Big, breaded drumsticks. Not my thing. But the sauce was good. The service was spot on and we had a good time despite my sadness over the breading. There were a lot of large groups and plenty of room for them here. Sports all around, prices were good."}
{"text":"If I could leave 10 stars I would. I had a group gathering here last week. and the manager (Steve) and his staff were amazing. The food and service was excellent. I couldn't recommend Majerles Desert Ridge higher. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Normal bar food late night menu. Went there after a basketball game to grab a burger. The atmosphere was nice and the bathrooms are clean. I have had drinks there a couple times too and the small, intimate size always makes the place look full."}
{"text":"Chicken strips, Chicken soft tacos, and Arnold palmers. I was satisfied and the service was good for being packed. They have great music videos playing and sports all round."}
{"text":"This place is your basic sports bar.  Lots of TVs all tuned to sports.  

The outdoor seating is on the sidewalk and facing East so you'll never get any direct sun.

My hamburger was TERRIBLE but the shoestring fries were great.  

My girl Jacqui liked her entree."}
{"text":"Talk about a lame chain of a resturant! Just because you slap on a home town heroe's name on the front of a building does not mean you should ever go there. 

The food is terrible and expensive - bad combination. Bartenders poor mad weak, I'm assuming to save monies. On my last visit during the 2013 NBA Finals, I did not care at all about the game, being Heat Spurs..I wanted to drink. Guess what? $150 later, no buzz! 

Save your money and go elsewhere and hope Thunder Dan can do more with the GCU Lopes than he can managing the Suns or this Restaurant."}
{"text":"I really like this Majerle's location. It was very close to where I used to work so it became a regular lunch spot. Prices are reasonable and the food is good. Their burgers are pretty good, I love their fries and the buffalo chicken sandwich is great. 

In addition to being a solid option for lunch, Majerle's is a great place for happy hour. Really good drink specials and all their apps (with a couple exceptions) are just $5. It's a great place to watch a game and has a nice sports atmosphere. Service is good, though if it's packed it can suffer a little. That happens anywhere though so I can't hold it against them.

If you want to watch a game at a sports bar in Old Town and have good food while doing it, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Just okay.  Nothing too special folks. On par with a TGIF (yikes).  Staff was professional and prompt. Decent beer selection. Several IPA's to choose.

Less of a sports bar and more of a night club. Which kinda killed it. But it's on the strip, so what's to expect.

Ordered a chicken Caesar salad (trying to slim down). 

YMMV"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a bloody Mary and some Sunday football. Didn't eat but my wife had nachos, they looked pretty good."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband and a few friends on a Friday night looking for a late dinner (10:30ish) and this was one of the few restaurants open. We walked in and sat ourselves and there was possibly 2 other tables and half a bar occupied. It was DEAD! So we got the menus and were then told that they are only serving appetizers. Not sure why but we assumed it was because of the time (not posted anywhere by the way). So we ordered a total of about 6 appetizers to share. The food was not good for a restaurant and was more like bar food that you would find at a hole in the wall. We were so disappointed. We should have gone to our second option and skipped this place, which is what we will for sure do in the future. I will say, the restaurant was clean and the sweet waitress (didnt catch her name) brewed fresh ice tea since I wanted tea. She really was probably one of the nicest waitresses we've ever had."}
{"text":"Well I entered this place and I was thinking wow I am I getting old the music is so loud... No it really was I could hardly talk to my dinner guest I ordered a Kilt Lifter draft and looked over the menu... I ended up going with the Cheeseburger Sliders (Mini char-grilled burgers, topped with sautéed onions and melted cheddar, served on a slider roll with au jus. Plus an order of the Gorilla Wings Hot one dozen served with buttermilk ranch... Well let's just say this was one bad meal sliders were dry and thank god for the au jus... The wings were so rubbery I could only eat 3 and that was tough I am not one to say this but for $20 bucks worth of food make it taste like... I will not be back to this place Dan Majerle might want to roll down there and try the food behind his name."}
{"text":"This place has a trap vibe on Sunday nights. They have outstanding Jolly Rancher Margaritas for $10 each. Also, get there early if you want a place to sit."}
{"text":"I ordered the burger and it was delicious. Perfectly cooked. The service was fantastic. This place has a beautiful patio that is dog friendly and has TVs and different kinds of seating to accommodate anyone. They also have bean bag games so if you perfect for you and your friends to go meet for cocktails and appetizers. Great for groups. Overall just a great atmosphere and good for a night out or for families"}
{"text":"I love Majerle's for what it is: a good times sports bar. I go there to enjoy sports related events, with sports minded people, easy bar food, and flowing beer.

They have a pretty extensive menu, and the food is good not great, but I didn't come here expecting a gourmet dining experience with the Cards game blasting in the background, so you shouldn't either.  What you should expect lots of beer, libations, fun people, and good service.  Double bonus for having a lot of tv's that are easy to see :)

If you're looking for a fun downtown bar to watch your favorite sporting event at, then I'd say alley-oop your way over to Majerle's!"}
{"text":"Great place to go to before or after any event downtown. My wife had the veggie wrap and I had a pulled pork sandwich. Both tasted great. That added to the excellent service we received   made it a enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Pretty empty, expected to have great service, was...okay. After we ordered, she didn't come back unless we stopped her for something. Ordered the gorilla wings and a burger, food was delicious until I was thrown off by all the gnats flying around and landing in our food. Not a lot to choose from so I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food. Checked this spot out on a Sunday afternoon and it was well worth it. Great music playing and the ambience was chill. Ordered nachos and gorilla wings (delish). Got a house wine and LIT, let's just say I'm tipsy ;) must check out while in Phoenix"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with any Majerle's location. I've been coming here since 2008 and the quality has always remained top notch. My favorite item is the Three Point Burger, which isn't on the menu anymore but they'll still make it for you if you ask. Their taco salad is also pretty good but in my opinion was better when they included the giant taco shell. The fries are by far the best I've ever had (I have random cravings for them all the time)...something about the perfect crispness and saltiness they've been able to master. If you're lucky they sometimes have live music. I know they also do trivia on Tuesdays. It goes without saying that it's a great place to watch a Suns game. Great crowd, great service, great food. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Been coming to this location since 2004 and it's only gotten better and better! My favorite item on the menu is the three point burger which comes with Majerle's delicious fries. I swear there's nothing like their fries! I'd also recommend the taco salad, which is not as good as when they had the taco shells but is still pretty bomb.

Its prime location serves as a great place for a pregame drink or dinner, or same afterward. The bar is also pretty legit and is nice for watching an away game or home game you don't have tix to. 

If you are coming with a large group, reserve the Cotton Club in advance for a more private experience. 

When there's not a major event/game in downtown, you can often find parking at the meters right around the viscinity. Otherwise, park in one of the garages nearby."}
{"text":"I've been coming to eat here since I was really small--a great family atmosphere during the day and a fun time at night. One of the best places to watch major sports games!!"}
{"text":"Love this sports grill!  It is everything I want from a sports grill venue.  And what is that?  Loads of televisions to view any game, good fare for the most finnicky of pallets, diverse clientel with a bit of class, and knowledgeable hosts with friendly smiles and plenty of explanations and personality.  I really find it hard to say anything bad about this place. I wish they had some on the east coast as I prefer this to the clanky Champs chain."}
{"text":"$3 domestic draft, $4 large domestic draft, crafts are around $1 - $2 off and appetizers are 50% off, from 3-7! What a great happy hour and fun atmosphere to hang out.

We had the cheesy bread, pretzel bits and boneless wings. Pretzel bits were probably the best, however all food was pretty good.

Our waitress (Antonia) was very attentive and extremely quick. Constantly coming around and asking if we needed anything. If you wanted to watch a sporting events there's probably over 30 TV's! Great place for watching games. 

First time here and won't be my last!"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had (literally). Spent $400 at the bar and it never got any better. Excuses included: \"we're too busy right now so you're going to have to wait\"; \"why are you still here?\"; \"I'm sorry it's taking so long but we're really busy right now.\" And that's just a couple explanations. Decent food, I won't lie. But, honestly I wouldn't send my worst enemies here. Just an overall terrible experience. The owner (As he calls himself but I think is just a manager) doesn't try to please anybody. The waitresses were quite nice, but he always came in and ruined anything they'd established. He honesty made this night the worst dinner experience me and my professional community have ever had. I would pay for people to go to other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"im not the best judge of a place like this given i dont particularly enjoy watching sports. but given i was \"dragged\" here, i enjoyed myself completely in all the ways i care about. its a lively sports bar, the bartenders are friendly and attentive, its comfortable. there are tvs all over the place showing various games, with the important (home) games on multiple angles, there is a ton of bar seating as well as tables.

i enjoyed an orange shandy (btw secret tip i learned from my 'dragging here' companion, add a shot of peach schnapps to a orange shandy and hello delicious!) and my cajun chicken sandwich. very much in fact; i highly recommend ordering it. nice kick, perfectly cooked chicken breast, lots of crispy shoestring fries.

there isnt much else to say. located right in downtown PHX, its easy access from the light rail, sooooo....all aboard and have fun. DUI not necessary."}
{"text":"My burger was great! I got the Triple Play (I think...the one with 3-cheeses) and I added bacon. The burger was slightly dry and over cooked (I ordered medium well), but overall it was good. I ordered the brownie to-go for desert...what a waste of money. $6.50 (which is fairly cheap) for hard little brownie squares that I couldn't even chew, they where that hard. I guess it's my fault for ordering it to-go, but I won't be back. Service was great! I am a Phoenix native and I remember selling Majerlie Bars at school back in the day. I love Thunder Dan, but I'll pass you can get the same things at TGI Fridays down the street."}
{"text":"Went in there to get a bite of lunch on a Sunday afternoon. The music was deafening. I could barely hear the hostess ask us if we \"needed a table\". I told her the music was too loud and we left!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday celebration. Music was great, service was horrible!!! Never again!!!"}
{"text":"The 3 stars is purely for the cool atmosphere. We came here on Saint Patrick's Day and it was oddly not very crowded. However for a sports bar, the tv screens are awesome! The bartender was friendly while waiting for the rest of our group to show up. Our waitress once seated was super nice but kind of a mess... she could barely remember what anyone ordered and the runners were confused. The food was not good at all with the exception of the fries. The boneless chicken wings were more like chicken strips and super rubbery and gross. I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"My favorite sports bar in the desert ridge area. Almost a club like atmosphere in the evenings with the decor and the purple lights. Somedays they play all types of music along with the music videos which makes it entertaining while watching sports. Food is also good. Out of all the items I have had, the burgers are my favorite. The burgers come with very tasty buns that you cant find anywhere else. Almost has a sweet after taste to it. Great selection of beer which includes several local beers. A bit pricey but not bad when there are deals. Awesome outdoor area for when the weather is nice, there is an area for corn hole. Wish they had some sort of deal on suns game night since Dan the man owns the place."}
{"text":"Majerle's gets 4 stars from me for 1 reason and 1 reason only.  Hip hop karaoke on Tuesday nights!!!

That's right, you heard me, Hip Hop Karaoke.  It was awesome.  Walked in with a big group after the Suns game, and it was packed.  Even so, the hostesses went out of their way to find a bunch of open tables and pushed them together for us.

Service wasn't nearly as quick as I'd like, but I try to be realistic.  When you're in a crowded sports bar right after a local sporting event, it's gonna take a few minutes to get your drinks, and I'm cool with that.

After people had a couple of drinks and loosened up, the karaoke lineup was classic!!  It started off with a tiny girl singing Gin and Juice by Snoop Dogg.  Then came the Beastie Boys and Salt N Pepa.  And that was enough, I was hooked!

In the business of full disclosure, I don't think it's advertised as Hip Hop Karaoke, I think it's just referred to as karaoke.  That's just what it's become known as between me and my friends because that's all we've ever heard/sang there.  Which is awesome if you've never experienced it.

Dan Majerle and a few of the Suns rolled there after the game too which was kind of cool, added another fun dynamic to the drunken sing a long.

Didn't have a bite of food so I can't comment on that.  But I did have a hell of a time and next time I can stay out late on a Tuesday (not nearly as often as I'd like) I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The short summation:
This Marjerle's location is not terrible, but not worth the price, especially when you take into consideration the plethora of sports bars, microbreweries and gastropubs that are in the area. I would say Marjerle's is actually a 2.5 star establishment, but will kindly round it up to three. A return visit would not be my first choice, but I would not object if someone else suggested it.

The restaurant:
The place is huge and there are a lot of big TV screens all over the place to watch most games. Marjerle's also may be the cleanest bar I've set foot inside. The server was pretty attentive. We put in a kids order right away and it felt like it was at the table in just seconds. I only had water and it was refilled before I ever made to the bottom of the cup. The only problem we had was it was tough to track her down around the time we wanted the check. Marjerle's also wasn't very crowded on a Friday night around 6:00pm (although it was pretty tough to find parking near the restaurant with the Desert Ridge crowd).

The food:
The food comes in massive portions and is quite filling. I had the Rajun Cajun. My wife had the Al McCoy's Hall of Fame Chicken Taco Salad. However, the way we felt about both of our meals is perfectly stated in the summation; not terrible, but not worth the price. The chicken sandwich was huge, but average at best. The salad was $12 and looked like it was 90% lettuce.

And what really bugs me:
We asked for a side of fruit with my daughter's kids meal instead of fries and were charged an extra $2. That made her chicken fingers meal $8.50. It was a pretty generous helping of fruit, but maybe Majerle's should consider making a smaller serving and having it as a free option instead (like many other restaurants). I'm so sorry that I wanted something nutritious on a 2-year-old's plate.

It's a shame. I remember when it was a big deal when Dan Marjerle opened the original location decades ago. And I remember liking it as place to go before or after an event at the arena or ballpark. I also remember liking the Chandler location when I went there with friends to watch Monday Night Football games years ago. It's been a long time since I was at either of those locations, but I certainly am not feeling nostalgic for those days anymore."}
{"text":"Came here the other night when we wanted a bite to eat and were in downtown. It was pretty dead when we first sat down, but then the Mercury game ended and there was a wait for tables outside. 

Food was good, but nothing special. Very cool bar and atmosphere and waiter was really nice. Great place to come after a game or to hang out, but it does get really crowded fast so if you really wanted to come here move fast after the game is over because this place is small!"}
{"text":"I had to ask how to pronounce the name. It's pronounced \"marleys\". Like an idiot, I was calling it Ma-jer-els. (I knew I was wrong, but still.) Glad I got that straightened out. 

If you've seen any of my other Yelp reviews, you would know that I love old buildings; and I like businesses that reuse old buildings. This one was built in the late 1800s and is one of the oldest still standing in Phoenix. Majerle's has been in the building since 1992, and that is impressive. Let's be honest, downtown Phoenix kinda really sucked in the early 90s. That they have managed to stay open for almost 20 years gets bonus points in my book. 

I had the BBQ chicken wrap, some mild wings, and a beer. (Well, I split it with someone, I am watching my figure.) I liked it. I liked it more than I thought I would since it's a sports bar. And it wasn't any more expensive than any other sports bar. I really liked the exposed brick walls that echoed stories from bygone years and sighed in relief that the wrecking ball never came. Thank you to Majerle's for having vision and bringing value to downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great sports bar. Lots of TV's, cool bartenders and a decent selection of local drafts. Staff is attentive yet laid back at the same time. I've been here three times this week on a four day trip!"}
{"text":"Came here with a large group (20+ people) for happy hour on a Friday evening, and the service was impeccable! We called ahead to let the restaurant know about our arrival. They were able to save a portion of the restaurant for us, which was greatly appreciated. The waitress, Katie, was extremely attentive with all of the multiple drink and food orders. Only downside was that I asked for a glass of water twice, but never ended up receiving it. Plus, they added 20% gratuity (vs the usually 18% that is associated with large groups). Good bang for your buck (for happy hour at least)!"}
{"text":"In the middle of a crowded UFC fight, the staff and management took time to make sure my wife and I had an awesome time. The food was great, the drinks were made delicious...we had plenty...and the service was phenomenal. I strongly recommend Majerle's!"}
{"text":"I'm all for the indulgences of fried food every now and again, but I tend to get the Strawberry Fields salad (and every time I sing the line from the famous song). 

I can't believe I haven't written a review yet. I've been eating at this location for over two years now. Sooo pleased. 

There's a new face, at least to me. His name is Sean and he was what I love about people who work in the restaurant business. Personable. Happy. Helpful. I could go on. 

As a whole, I really enjoy coming here on Sunday Fundays or to watch the game or to get this seriously flipping fantastic salad!"}
{"text":"Went here after a baseball game for late night happy hour. I had a couple of beers and an appetizer. The staff was very helpful. A nice little place to get a brew After a game on Phoenix."}
{"text":"Satisfied with the food and service. Nice sports bar to try on."}
{"text":"Good sports bar with decent food.  The servers all seem to be a little ditzy but they are friendly.  It can get kind of crazy on the weekend nights (i.e. typical scene of Old Town Scottsdale bars on the east side of Scottsdale Rd.)  But during game time or Happy Hour it's a fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"Always have good service, great food and a sports filled atmosphere! Generally, little to no wait for seating. Service is fast and friendly. Food is never disappointing and the fries are awesome! We keep coming back and get the same result time after time - so we love the consistency."}
{"text":"We ordered the Gorilla wings honey garlic to go (so that we could watch the game at home) and also order a Greek salad. The salad was okay, but the wings were pretty good. Crispy and flavorful."}
{"text":"It started nice but turned south fast. Beer is a great commodity but food is not. Beer came fast but food - I mean mozzarella sticks - took FOREVER!!! Server was rude. Never got napkins and she dropped off my sticks without even a word. Never coming back... and I LOVE Thunder Dan"}
{"text":"Majerle's serves your typical bar food named after various popular Suns players. The menu consists mainly of sandwiches, burgers, wraps, and salads.

After browsing through the menu I decided on the green chile burger. While it's nice that they prepare the burgers to your preferred doneness, my medium rare burger turned out more medium well. It was a fairly hefty burger on a sweet toasted bun with cheese, lettuce, tomato, and onion. The fries that came with it were more on the thinner side and were decent.

Service was good and we were routinely checked up on. Drinks were refilled as needed."}
{"text":"This is going to be quite brief, but I love Majerle's. Their Strawberry Fields salad is the BEST salad I have ever had in my life. And the service is always great. One day the bartender even gave me some extra pecans and dressing to take back to work to snack on. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place was decent. The rajun Cajun chicken sandwich was tasty but it wasn't nearly as spicy as I expected Cajun food to be. The waitress was also kind."}
{"text":"Try the fries. They're bomb, best I've ever had. Fairly decent place and been around for years."}
{"text":"March freaking madness is in full swing in our household. Majerle's is of course the hot spot for all March Madness madness. We came here for Happy Hour and I love this place. First and foremost, what is in the TC sauce? I could pour that sauce on my morning breakfast, afternoon lunch and dinner. Maybe even ice cream for dessert.
Next time we visit here we're ordering 2 orders of Gorilla Wings because we breezed through those in a heartbeat. The egg rolls, chicken tenders yep, all dunked in TC sauce. 
I drank 2 casamigo's margos the bartender made with love because I left feeling really happy!! 
Majerles is simple, casual and better than a lot of sports bars in the area."}
{"text":"My company had our work holiday dinner hear and i have to say, it was delicious! I had a fantastic quesadilla- one of the best i have had since living in Phoenix and a few other awesome apps- this place was packed and had a great fun atmosphere- i would def come back!"}
{"text":"Have been here a handful of times and always order the exact same thing. It's consistent and always amazing!! Order the grilled chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. Sandwich is dressed with Sprouts, bacon and avocado. While you're waiting, order a cocktail! The bartenders have a solid pour."}
{"text":"Stopped by here tonight on the recommendation of a friend and it was definitely a good time. The staff was very friendly and attentive and the food was just as good. I had the tenderloin sliders and the prawn appetizer, very spicy.  Both were excellent and the Guinness was poured perfectly. All in all, an excellent time and Kara, my waitress, was exceptional. I highly recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"The only times I have been here has been after Suns games on a weekday, so not too often. But, this is the best spot to hang after a game. Good prices and quality food, they have some pretty creative and delicious drinks as well(collection of Mule drinks in different flavors.) The Majerle chain is pretty good and this location is no exception."}
{"text":"I stopped coming here since the kitchen was under performing but thought I would  give it another try.  Menu has been updated and my burger was perfectly cooked, which hadn't happened before.  Might be new management or a new chef but they earned my business back"}
{"text":"The service is awesome! Shana is spectacular, very friendly, helpful & attentive (not to mention a great smile).
We had the wings (honey spice sauce & Teriyaki), potato skins & sliders. All of it was very good, the wings are large & meaty."}
{"text":"For a mall sports bar it is not bad, but the greater Phoenix area is filled with so many better sports bars.  The food, the staff, and the ambience are okay. For a sports bar, at least have some great food to keep up with the Joneses.  Sorry, but I'm not going back unless that is where my friends want to go."}
{"text":"Stopped in here a couple weeks ago when I was unfortunate enough to have to be in Scottsdale.  I was with a group that thought it would be a good idea...yeah.  So, after not making it a minute in the club next door before I was horridly annoyed, our party came here to unwind and get some drinks without the fakeness of Old Town clubbers.  We were impressed.  It seemed like a good group of people, no attitudes, and easy to get a booth.  The only complaint was that the service was quite slow for how not busy it was in there.  I would go back again and give it another shot."}
{"text":"Definitely a cool spot.  We live downtown and were looking for a place to watch Game 1 of the Cavs-Warriors game and stopped in last night.  It was packed.  We were fortunate enough to get a couple barstools as there was some convention in town and it appeared everybody was flocking here.  The bartenders were great.  We never ran dry on drinks and were able to get some good wings on happy hour.  We tried boneless wings and their \"Gorilla Wings\".  The boneless wings were great but we were not a fan of the Gorilla Wings by any means.  They were tough and not very tasty.  It was almost is if we were eating deer jerky.  But the boneless wings were great.  

The vibe in here is what made it fun.  There were a lot of Golden State fans a lot of Cavs fans.  There was a lot of cheering and booing going on but not in a hostile way.  It was  good time. 

This will definitely be our go-to for games and drinks."}
{"text":"I didn't try any food hear but this place seems like it has a split personality. Tons of tvs showing sports so sports bar. At the same time there's a dj blasting club music. There weren't that many people dancing. We went here because the place next door had a huge line. One plus is that theres a second bar near the patio that we stuck by. This place to me was...meh."}
{"text":"Was told this is the best place in downtown Phoenix to catch a game. It's not. They play crappy music instead of the sound from games, food is typical sports bar junk, and drinks are expensive. On top of that the crowd is pretty crappy unless you like washed up jocks acting like they own the town. If that's your thing, this is your spot."}
{"text":"Went to Majerle's for Trivia on Tuesday.. Its c ool because all the questions come up on the screens, but was too loud from the background music and random customers to focus on the questions. Food is good, and the 2 for 1 beer special is pretty awesome.  rated the place for being good, but not my first choice."}
{"text":"I've been at this location since it was opened and I must say this past weekend, I think I experienced the best service!  The Asian Chicken Salad -awesome!  Two people can eat this salad it's so BIG!  I was there twice this weekend, I also had a chicken sandwich which was great and fullfilling.  The waitress remembered what we drank so that was great.  I was with a large group of people and the staff at Majerle's took care of everyone really well.    The Strawberry Fields Salad looks really good as well, yumm!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. No beer specials on NFL Sundays. Too much space between TVs (should be bigger TVs).

$6 for a Bloody Mary is their \"special.\"  $2 more than Zipps next door. $11 for a SMALL pitcher of domestic beer. Unreal...

On top of this, surly bartenders!"}
{"text":"Whoever designed the TV layout (and sizes/placement - and number) in the bar and dining areas needs a lashing. What a missed opportunity!

Only 1 TV on patio. And it's not even on.

Mediocre drink specials.

Service OK."}
{"text":"Several of the bar TVs are obscured by the very tall tap handles. :(  

They need to get the short ones.

Also, half the bar seats only face 1 TV (and the other half faces just two). There should be 3 on the long sides and 2 on the ends.

$5 Bloody Mary on Sunday."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix so I came here to watch Sunday Football with my BF yesterday. The greeter and server were very friendly and had great service. Unfortunately, the food was nasty. I ordered a grilled cheese and it came with avocado and tomatoes in it. Gross! I asked the server if I could try something else and she offered to have it remade without the extra ingredients. I did not want to make a fuss because she already had her hands full with a bar full of Athletic Directors from the AD national conference so I agreed. She had it remade and it was still gross. I was very disappointed because this place was raked as a top 10 sports bar in the area. I didnt end up eating my food but somehow still had it on my receipt. I will never come back and do not recommend this place for food at all!"}
{"text":"The best boneless buffalo wings ever! They are not the overly breaded wings with a sliver of meat. They appear to be flash fried, very similar to bone-in wings so that you get the same texture. They taste exactly like traditional buffalo wings only minus the bones. Easily the best boneless wings that I have ever tried. And only $6 during happy hour, Monday through Friday from 3 to 7pm."}
{"text":"\"Thunder Dan\" lives on in Downtown Phoenix!  

This is a very good choice if you're looking for a cool sports bar atmosphere before/during/or after a Suns/Dbacks game while in downtown.  The ambiance is great being dimmly lit, having exposed bricks, newer newer flat screens tv's and surround sound that really makes you feel apart of the game.  

I'm only commenting this place as a bar and not on its food.  I don't think this would be in my top twenty of choices to eat at with so many other great dining choices nearby.  Only come here for the scene and the drinks, you really can't go wrong with that at Majerle's!"}
{"text":"Been there several times over the years, but this past weekend the service was AWEFUL!  I would think a place like this would be used to busy crowds.  The food is great, but the service (wait staff) need more help!"}
{"text":"I think there may be some room for improvement service wise. Notwithstanding, it is probably the best sports bar located in the Downtown Phoenix area. Especially if you are a Suns fan! Lots of nostalgia on the walls and Suns regalia. As far as the food: it's pretty damn good. They have all the usual selections for beer, they may be able to improve in that category. But if you have Kiltlifter, you're doing pretty well in my book. 

If you are debating about going here or TK I would absolutely positively go to this joint! Go Suns!"}
{"text":"Was in from out of town for a concert and stumbled across Majerles. We grabbed drinks and food before the concert and this place was packed, clearly everyone going to the concert had the same idea. We were able to find a seat at the bar. The service was great, the drinks were good and the food was good. Would definitely check it out for a quick drink and bite."}
{"text":"Just went here to Majerle's tonight with a couple of friends and Sawyer was an excellent server!;) She got everything correct on our order and to top it off she is such a sweet person! Keep up the great work!;)"}
{"text":"Love this place. ...But food has changed. Ok happy hour food for one. Why is 5 Madison street skins. 7.00 for only 5 pieces.  Last I knew you cut 3 potatoes  in half you get six? Right, what do you do with the last half.  Lol anyways at least give 6 halves.
Our all time fav....WINGS, something changed. ..not as good! Check your chef please and fix this b4 football season really gets going."}
{"text":"The appetizer sampler is super yummy!  They have spring rolls that have avocado in them drizzled with a teriyaki sauce.  It's an odd combination but yummy."}
{"text":"\"My vodka soda tastes like water. Lame.\" July 5th 2012

Yeah, this place was pretty mediocre...which says a lot considering how uninteresting Phoenix is at night.

The place was packed, the drinks were pricey, and the waitress made sure to let us know after we sat down that we had to go to the bar to order our drinks as she was off duty. And...my vodka soda tasted like water."}
{"text":"First round NCAA tournament, Arizona game, they're understaffed, ran out of lemons, have one bar tender working, and the kitchen staff can't go half and half on regular and sweet potato fries.  Our server is friendly but scrambling.  Turkey sliders could not be less impressive.  I won't make this mistake again."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday night just to eat!  Other businesses in the area were busy and thought we would be able to grab a bite to eat before heading out on the town!!  Well thought wrong, place is obviously banking on the people who are looking for handouts!  We waited 25 minutes for our drinks, 45 for our food, ( which were chips and salsa and nacho). Sliders where burnt as well with a bite mark taken out of the patty. Also, our shots took 20 min to get.  Staff were on their phones rather than paying attention to customors .  Food was messed up,  drinks and food took forever!"}
{"text":"I opened a yelp account so I could write this review.   
Monday afternoon, looking for a fun date lunch with my wife (vary rare).  Our server is around our sons age. 
Worst service ever!  Told manager on duty who must be friends with server and she was rude as all get out!   
We left never to return."}
{"text":"After checking out their menu online we headed downtown .. we were seated quickly, but it took 20min for the waitress to stop by our table to take our order..

We were given different menus .. mine had sandwiches at $11 my boyfriends said $13, most items including drinks were $2 less on my menu? I mentioned this to the hostess and she told me only the paper was different .. um no, she did pull all of the wrong ones when she realized I was right and amazingly the menu with the lower prices was correct!! 

Food arrived quickly .. I ordered the ragin Cajun, seasoning on the chicken was good, the Cajun mayo didn't do anything to help the sandwich and the Texas sweet roll bun is to big .. after two bites of mostly bread I had to eat open face sandwich style .. shoestring fries were really good .. 

Boyfriend ordered the diablo rojo, he thought the bun was to big also and after the chicken was gone he had several bites of bun left on his plate..

Several items online are no longer available in the restaurant.. we arrived at 11:30 on Sunday they were not busy for such poor customer service .. waitress came by to clear plates never checked on us after food arrived .. too many other places in downtown to try.."}
{"text":"Oh no. Not so good. V just OK. No need to go. Just have the beer. It is good. Tastes like the same as other places with beer. Have something deep fried with your beer. That'll be fine."}
{"text":"Last night a few of us wanted to go out and have dinner and drinks.  After hitting up a few spots, we ended up here because most places were packed due to the UFC fight going on.

Even though I'm a regular at Chandler Fashion Center, I've never eaten at Majerle's.  Figured we may as well check it out, and, well, I was kind of let down some.

When we entered, the place was packed.  Not only because it was Saturday night, but the UFC fight was going on, so there was a million people in this place.  The hostess asked if we were here for the fight or not, as it would determine where they would seat us.  We told her that we were not here to watch the fight, so she seated us outside.  That was fine by us, since it was mostly empty on the patio.

Our waitress was okay, but she mostly forgot about us during the evening.  She was nice and all that, but we never got our drinks refilled, and I had to go ask the hostess to find her because we had waited what seemed like an eternity to get our bill.  Its never a good sign when you have to ask the hostess for drinks and your bill.

I was dissappointed with the service here because I kind of expected more.  Some could argue that it was a busy saturday night with a UFC fight going on, but the server dam near forgot about us.  She even walked by our table at one point and after I tried to get her attention, she never saw or heard me calling for her, and kept on walking!  FAIL!!  I mean, I guess the big bucks were inside watching the fight....blah.

I don't know that I will be back again, but for a sports bar, its actually kind of nice.  Just don't expect to much for service when going here."}
{"text":"We were there unexpectedly during happy hour, which I think was 5-7...my daughter and I had several of the $6 appetizers and my husband had the ragin' Cajun chicken sandwich which was so huge that at first he thought it was battered but was actually a lot of seasoning. Overall, the food and service were a five but the place could use some maintenance and some air freshener."}
{"text":"This place gets packed for lunch! The menu is extensive and moderately priced. My friend and I both had turkey burgers and both of us were really pleased! I recommend the green chile burger :-). Delish. The fries were great- skinny, shoestring fries. 

I only gave this 3 stars because it is your typical sports bar- lots of TVs, nothing special. But the food is great. I would be a repeat customer of I lived in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Been twice.. Drinks are overpriced and the food is just ok. If it wasn't for the good service, I would have given it one star."}
{"text":"Bigger and more comfortable than the downtown location, IMO. This is THE place to watch basketball, and an absolutely amazing sound system to keep you in the game whether you're inside or on the patio. Draft selection is decent, and there are some unassuming cocktails for under $10. The app menu is also very affordable, even when it's not happy hour. Service was also spiffy, and our waitress was always great at making rounds even though it was a full house. I can't not recommend this to my friends."}
{"text":"It's a generic sports bar at heart, but fortunate enough to have a really good theme and a really good location. 

Drink selection? Admittedly nice to see some stoli here, but nothing at the bar really floored me. 

Decor? I'm a Suns fan for life, so of course I have to come here! I grew up watching \"Thunder Dan\" play, and I think this is a really good place to watch a game. Naturally, the staff are young women with fast drink-mixing skills and exposed midriffs.

Food? Meh. There's nothing wrong with it, but there's nothing out of the ordinary, and nothing executed particularly well. My burger was an average burger. My chicken sandwich was an average chicken sandwich. If you HAVE to eat like right now, it will do. But considering where you are, you've got soooo many cooler options to dine.

When you're done, the light rail is a stone's throw away. Sometimes I need a solid sports bar to drink a domestic and yell at a screen with the guys. Downtown doesn't offer too many options for that, so Majerle's will continue to get my business."}
{"text":"Cool spot downtown right by the Hyatt Recency and down the street from the Suns Basketball arena. Plenty of tv's with sports on and a nice clean, comfortable environment. Wife and I  both had the fried jalapeno burger and really liked it. It had less spice than expected but very good. We also did the slam dunk shrimp appetizer and we all loved it. Kids were happy with their Mac n cheese and chicken fingers. Drink prices are pretty average for downtown with a decent selection. We had good food and service both visits."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a bit to eat and some sports watching the other night. My boyfriend had never been before and we are close to down town so it seemed a great idea. 

Pleased we were! First we got a bomb parking spot right out the front door and it wasn't too crowded so we got a nice table and served quickly. They have happyhour until 7pm, which I love! Most place stop at 6, which sucks since most people cant make it anywhere without driving light speed before 6pm after work. So 7pm cut off for HH is a great find! Pass it on!

We ordered the boneless wings to start with half medium sauce and half of their special TD sauce, I recommend both! TD sauce is similar to Zipps Golden sauce if you know what that is like, but better. Then I got the chicken tacos, very good. Enjoyed them greatly! Exactly what I was looking for, hit the spot! Jon got some kinda spicy pasta, which when it hit the table looked amazing, however big prob, they put mushrooms in it, this isn't listed on the menu and Jon is allergic. They took care of it quickly though, remade his selection sans mushrooms and we found out it was as good as it looked. 

Very nice staff, clean inside, fast service, lots of TVs.... and great happyhour specials!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks are exceptional. The atmosphere is fun and hip. To top it off, the owners and managers are cool enough to check on you to make sure you're having a great time. I make sure to visit this place every time I'm in Chandler."}
{"text":"While waiting to go to a performance at Symphony Hall my daughter and I decided to have dinner here. We were seated right away on the patio. Shortly after our server came by and took our drink order. I ordered a water and I ordered water to start. 
My daughter took one drink of milk and said \"mommy, I don't like this milk\" me thinking it may just be something she wasn't used to, I took a big drink. The milk was BAD! There was no doubt it was well beyond its expiration date. It was everything I could do not to get sick. 
We told our server and she apologized. Then said they poured it from the bar. Like where they serve it from should change my perspective. Like because it was from the bar I should not be bothered by the fact they are ok with serving rotten milk. 

The manager brought out our food and never addressed the rotten milk. 
It leads me to wonder, if they don't check milk expiration dates and freshness what else do they overlook?"}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times while on vacation catching a few suns games and have always left happy.service is good,food is good and atmosphere is great.actually got to meet thunder Dan and do shots with him wich was pretty unreal.its a sports bar so don't come here expecting anything more than bar type food"}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Majerle's in over a year, so decided to visit for dinner and watch a game or two.  The service was very good and the waitress was attentive, without being annoying.  I was disappointed to see that the menu is exactly the same as it has been for several years.  I had to stifle a yawn or 2 perusing the tired, outdated offerings listed.  I wonder if patrons even know who some of the people are that have signature items on the menu?!  We ordered a beer and a glass of wine.  The waitress delivered large, icy glasses of water garnished with lemon-looked delicious!  Imagine the dismay when I took a large sip and immediately tasted nasty, Phoenix tap water! . The drinks came next and I was surprised to see  wine served in a tiny, cheap wine glass exactly like the ones you get in a Chinese food restaurant! My companion ordered a burger  and fries, and I ordered the Asian Chicken Salad.  The food is average at best, but the salad was nothing more than a pile of greens with a chicken breast plopped in the middle.  Won Ton strips surrounded the lettuce, and a big pile of slimy roasted red pepper glob on top! . Good thing the dressing was good enough to put some sort of flavor into this drab concoction.

The atmosphere at Majerle's is loud and big screen TVs adorn the walls.  I recall a time many years ago, where it was a hot place to be, with waits for tables and a crowded bar.  It was fun and interesting.  Not so now.  Friday night at 7 found an almost empty bar, and a half full restaurant.  Now I know why."}
{"text":"Very good burgers!! A must visit if coming into Phoenix. Right off the light rail. Garlic butter spread and texas sweet roll is awesome. Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Good service expensive food and a cockroach that ran up the booth behind my friend while we were eating our food.  We told the manager and he said \"We sprayed the other day\"  Nothing comped and we lost our appetites.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"Great service & yummy food. Enjoyed watching the game while there. Fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Just had a great lunch here. Ordered a club sandwich, which is one of the best I have ever had. You wonder how a club sandwich can be elevated, but they pulled it off. Ham, turkey, cheddar, American cheese, tomatoes, and mayo. Oh, and the fries were great. 

Service was prompt and very friendly. Next time I am back here, I will totally remember this place."}
{"text":"I was really interested in giving this place a try and finally decided to. The interior reminds me of strip club with the purple lights thru the ceiling. We only ordered one of the fries appetizers and it wasn't anything spectacular. The menu just didn't interest me they had too many options. Typically when a restaurant has a ton of options they can't make everything perfect. The menu is a huge turn off. I can't say I will return."}
{"text":"02.07.10

Great place to catch the big game.  TV screens everywhere, projector screen on blast.  Surround sound.

Beer isn't cheap, but the wings are on special during football [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kHpXJ2vciumu2KhNHg0hYA?select=8PgwEaa1nqdCt9c0zP3tBQ]!"}
{"text":"We were there last Thursday to watch the game, we were surprised it wasn't Wolfley's anymore, too bad because Wolfley's food was way better, Majerle's food was cheaply made,  the menu is super boring and food just tasted awful, seriously, it's sad because the restaurant itself is great, but the food is just not worth it to go back at all, it could be so much better if they just put more effort in their food."}
{"text":"Decent place that had a lot of hype. Food was decent. A step above traditional bar food. The drinks were stiff and fairly priced. The place was kind of dirty and didn't have the best atmosphere. Decent to stop for a drink and an appetizer, but not a must see type of place."}
{"text":"Place got great reviews as a local sports bar so we decided to step in on a trip. Nothing bad, but all in all was just a typical sports bar with barfood. If that's what you're looking for and give it a shot. But if you're looking for a little bit more of a great dining experience I would look somewhere else locally."}
{"text":"Go for Happy Hour. Good Value
Great place to have and beer and watch a game.
Ask for Michael as a server."}
{"text":"I love their surprise menu items on Tuesdays. The wait staff is great and a perfect place to stop for lunch."}
{"text":"So everyone in Old Town has been waiting for a good sports bar forever. When everyone heard Thunder Dan was coming to town the excitement starting buzzing. Well this time Thunder Dan didn't hit this buzzer beater.

First off it does get two stars for a reason so lets start there. The atmosphere is great. The venue is super cool and there is tons of tvs. 

Thats pretty much where it stops. The food isn't great and is relatively slow. I have had a burger, wings, the chicken quesadilla and a couple of other things which didn't impress me. Plus the service was super slow...

This kind of reminds me of the Suns-Bulls series super exciting but just misses the mark of greatness. I am sticking with my old faithful two blocks away Zipps."}
{"text":"Bar food. Nothing more, nothing less. Had chicken soft tacos. Burgers looked good. Tried some chips and salsa too. Read other  reviews about customer service...spot on. Our party had lots of food left on the table when we left. Coworkers gave it a 'meh' as well. No need to return ever again."}
{"text":"Good food, drinks good, good service, except at the end when we wanted to leave! They were pretty busy, but my husband had to walk over to our waitress and ask for our check! Note: it was the first Thursday night football game, so it's crowed, but once the game started, it got very loud. Not great if you've got little kids!!
All in all I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Enjoy going here and have always had friendly service though it can be a little slow. Understandable occasionally, not consistently though."}
{"text":"Majerle's is a little bar in downtown, owned by Dan Majerle- former beloved Suns player.  Remember when he was \"Thunder Dan\"?  Those were the days...

This bar has been open for awhile.  Quite a few years actually.  And it's still a fun place to go.  It's a good spot for quick (or not so quick) after work drinks.  But the number one thing this bar is good for is...you guessed it! Watching the game!

Since the bar is pretty little, it does get packed, but service is usually pretty good.  There are enough TV's that you can see the action from wherever you are sitting, and you just might spot an NBA player or two while you're there.

I met Thunder Dan here myself once and might I add, he has amazingly soft hands for a man ."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar, other then being owned by Dan Majerle. Nice location, right on the metro rail.  Bit on the pricy side."}
{"text":"Place was very rude and seemed a bit racist. Not returning. Gluck to your customers. Worst service I've received and food sucks, avoid if you can."}
{"text":"Let me start by extending a BIG Thank You to the staff at Majerle's!  My elderly friend fell outside the restaurant (due to the extremely high curbs) and we had about 5 staff helping out and ran to her aid.  Each helping in getting ice, towel, bandages, peroxide and assisting her in getting up.  We were very impressed with their attentiveness to her injures and never left her till she was able to get up!!  

Now for the dining experience:  BLT was perfect and Customer service was superb!  

Back to the staff; I can't say enough about how helpful they all were.  Kudos to the General Manager, he bandaged her up and was AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"The place is really nice and clean. The employees are Kind and helpful. But the food is just subpar. I had ordered chicken tenders and French fries. The chicken tenders were just ok. Not juicy at all but edible. But the fries were terrible. The fries have no thickness at all. They are extremely thin and pack no flavor whatsoever. It wasn't terrible, but I would not come here again."}
{"text":"We were in the area last week and went to Majerle's for dinner. The employees were super friendly and gave us excellent customer service from the moment we walked in. This is your standard sports bar so of course you need to order lots of wings. They were so good we forgot to take a picture until after we ate them all. We were in the mood for munching out so we ordered sliders next and they were also very good. Be sure to try the cheesy bread as it's amazing. No one would admit to eating it all so I didn't get any but it looked great. All in all this was very enjoyable and we would return."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  I ordered the Cuban.  It was served on a what looked like a pressed down hot dog bun.  If you served this in Miami, a few boats would turn back.

Maybe Dan was mad at Mark Cuban of the Dallas Mavericks and this was never intended on the menu.  Flat horrible greasy bread with 2 thin slices of meat.  I've seen some better grilled ham and cheese sandwiches  made by kids.  

I had to wash off the grease from touching it.  Just nasty.  $60 spent tonight, nothing good to say about
 other items such as the dry hamburger or plain wrap.  The family simply wanted to get out.  

Service was nice.  Waitress was nice.  Opted out of fries.  Paid the $2 upgrade for fruit, Yet she back to say they had no seasonal fruit. How about the side salad?  Ok with ranch.  It came with Italian.  Just left it un-eaten.  Like half my sandwich.  When a good portion of your meal goes in the trash, you may want to follow-up."}
{"text":"Get the majerles wings! Hold cow! Secret sauce was the best wing sauce I've ever had. The order came out freezing cold which was a bummer but I sent it back and it came back piping hot & delicious.

Service was slow slow slow. Return visits from the waitress was non existent. This would of been a 5 Star if service was prompt."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The staff is always friendly and they always wear a smile! They are always willing to give you options if you never know what to eat. We all know how hard that can be at times! You should try the majerlarita with strawberries! So yummy!!! Plus you can get as many as you would like. That was my favorite part! If you have never been here, you should give it a shot! You won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. I've tried a few things here and it has always been good! I luv to get the caesar salad with shrimp! And the restaurant itself is nice. TVs every where. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have always been a big fan of Dan Marjeles since the 80s when he played for the Phoenix Suns and heard of his restaurant for over twenty years but never had the opportunity to eat there. Here was an opportunity to finally eat at the downtown location near the Hyatt regency. We came around 8 pm and then service was slow
 I had to ask twice for drinks and appetizers by going outside and chasing down a staff member. The food was average at best, French dip, pulled pork sandwich, and shrimp tacos were ordered. The only highlight of the evening was heading out the door and being stopped by a homeless war vet who asked me to purchase a framed pic of his poem for fifteen dollars. He impressed me with his intellect and demeanor that I gave him a twenty and my leftovers. I did thank him for his service before leaving. I would go back if needed but it would not be my first choice on 2nd avenue in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My pub crawl compadres and I stopped at Majerle's after having a brief but terrible experience at Networks. I was definitely impressed by the modern stylings and decor. To give Majerle's some credit, they did actually honor their agreement to participate in the pub crawl, offering a drink special, but it turns out that the disgustingly sweet $3 Stoli strawberry lemonades were available to everyone. There were also no food samples. Why did we buy pub crawl wristbands again? 

We attempted to make up for the slowly-worsening pub crawl experience by ordering vodka shots. There was some miscommunication between the bartenders because when the girl we ordered them from disappeared and another bartender approached us to ask if we needed help, we somehow ended up with two rounds of shots. Naturally, we didn't want to pay for both, a statement that got us quite a bit of attitude from the bartenders. The mistake wasn't entirely their fault (we could have been clearer, I supposed), but I could have done without the 'tude, especially since you can just pour vodka back into a bottle. No harm, no foul, right?

Anyway, I wouldn't refuse to come back to Majerle's before or after a game, but I definitely wouldn't choose over 15-20 other places in a 5-mile radius that have great food, cheaper drinks, and friendlier service."}
{"text":"Ashley was such a kind considerate waitress. Anthony made my family feel so \"at home\"! I would definitely recommend Majerle's to anyone in the downtown area looking for great food and a good time!"}
{"text":"Awesome sports bar.  Actually went here for the night life after hitting a few other bars - just a lively bar blasting some of the best hits with music videos to match.  I duno, I just like when they play the music video that goes to the songs you like.  There used to be a TV station that would play music videos and it was pretty cool....what was it called again??? OH YEAH!!! MTV!!"}
{"text":"I went for the 2 dishes they had highlighted on their menu: Slam dunk shrimp and the Rojo Diablo. Slam dunk shrimp was really good and worth a try. I don't recommend the Rojo Diablo. 

Nothing special about this sandwich. The fried chicken reminded me of a chicken patty and it was a little on the tough side. The chicken breast of also very thin which made the bun overwhelming. I had to ditch the bun at the end so I could actually taste the chicken. 

I'm sure their other dishes are better, and I would recommend they change this highlighted item to something else."}
{"text":"They have just a few tv's, which you cant see from some parts of the restaurant. The bar service is slow as molasses, and they have the audacity to take a $60 hold on your credit card every time you sit anywhere near the door, even when I go in dressed in a nice suit and tie. The wings are my favorite in Phoenix, and are delicious, but everything else on the menu seems to be just adequete. One thing I can count on is them always being open until at least midnight and having decent food. You can also count on being harassed by bike taxi guys and hobos out front, and getting crappy bar service. Just walk in, order the wings to go, and have a nice meal in the park or at your home."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great happy hour and food is great!  Love Marisa and Brittany! We go in and they have lots of TVs!  They will change TV the channels to any sports team you like!  Great service!"}
{"text":"Good place for a beer. Excellent boneless wings."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite to eat before catching a game at Chase stadium.  I would give the service 4-stars, but the food was very bland and boring.  I ordered french dip with sweet potato fries, the roast beef taste like beef jerky and the bread was cold and old, the fries were cold and the waitress offered to make me another batch, however they were still pretty bland.  The beer was cold and refreshing, however I would not return to this place. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place had gone downhill. I used to go there before or after a game. No more. The last time I ate there they skimped on the meat on my Italian Beef sandwich. I wrote the manager and he/she didn't even give me tje courtesy of a response. So I decided to write the so-called \"Thunder Dan.\" Again no response. That's just indifferent management."}
{"text":"The last time I was in Phoenix I had a business dinner here and ordered their wings and then some special meal (included salad, chicken and something else).  The place was empty and the waitress was actually bothered we had chosen to eat dinner in her section.  To make a long story short - I got sick that night with some type of food poisoning and spent the next 12 hours trying to sleep between throwing up and running a fever.  Will definitely never go back."}
{"text":"Poor quality food, high prices and average service ensure we won't be returning.

Initially we planned on going to Pita Jungle across the street, but there was a 20 minute wait and while we like PJ, it's not worth waiting 20 min for. As an alternative we headed over to Majerle's since we hadn't been there since they took over from Wolfley's. What a disappointment. 

I ordered a French Dip and my partner had a BLT. He enjoyed his BLT, but how hard is it to goof that up? My French Dip was awful, soft and mushy bread smashed down on top of gross  beef with some cheese on it for $11. A French Dip is supposed to be served on fresh crusty French baguette. Add to that they serve shoestring fries, not my favorite, but if you like them whatever. I don't. 

With two drinks and tip we spent $32 for food I wouldn't feed my dog, if I had a dog. Blue 32 at the Scottsdale 101 is much better."}
{"text":"Dropped in late Sunday afternoon after shooting photos for a few hours. Was tired and welcomed warmly by Arthur behind the bar. He introduced himself and shook both and my photo buddies hand. 

While I had only a Coke it was refreshed with a new one when I got to about 1/2 way. My buddy ended up ordering two club sandwiches and judging by the fact that a) he ordered two and b) the plate looked mighty clean they were pretty darn yummy. 

I've been the Majerle's before this visit was very nice and I would definitely come back...will come back this time with an appetite."}
{"text":"I love the food here and have no complaints with the service, atmosphere or location. That being said almost a year later I see they still have the Majerlerita on the drink menu and don't serve it. I've said it before best margarita I've ever tasted but if you're not going to fix your machine that makes them, kindly remove it from the menu. #falseadvertising"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying my husband and I love bars and love bar food. We have started to consider ourselves kind of bar food connoisseurs and love trying new places and old hole in the wall places. 
This place is quite literally the worst bar/bar food we have ever had. 
I ordered a pineapple margarita from their \"special majerlerita\" menu. I could not find an ounce of pineapple in it and our server (tereza) wouldn't stay around long enough to even let us tell her it tasted horrible. It's pretty hard to mess up a margarita THAT badly. I ordered one of their top picks on the menu which were fish tacos. The fish was overly salty and the salsa that accompanied them had no flavor at all. It was literally just tomato, no onion no jalapeño no salt or pepper, nothing! I finally had to ask for some limes so I could give the poor tacos some flavor. The tortillas were an incredibly odd texture. They almost tasted like they were \"homemade\" but they were almost raw... 
Our experience could have been slightly saved had our waitress had some sort of a pleasant attitude. But, instead we were met with a sour careless attitude. No please, no thank you, nothing. She just slams down plates and walks away. Then our check comes and again she just drops it and walks away. 
We pride ourselves on trying to be as polite as possible and we don't ask for much so we couldn't figure out where her attitude was coming from. We watched as other tables noticed her bad service. I even saw one customer walk up to the bar to get a refill because tereza was no where to be found. 

All in all just an awful experience, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Decent food, great vibe inside and out. The location is great just not fun trying to drive around here Friday and Saturday night. Staff is friendly and they're efficient."}
{"text":"my wife and i went there last month, to have drinks, eat, and watch ufc. the food was great. drinks are good. the prices were a tad higher but nothing that bad.  great place to watch ufc or football. we went there for ufc and the asu vs au game was that night."}
{"text":"The food and service is always great at majerlies. It is a perfect spot to have a few drinks and watch the game."}
{"text":"Watched Game 1 of the World Series here and had a great time, typical bar food, but excellent service and let us take our time, checked in with us regularly but not too pushy either."}
{"text":"In town for a Convention and was recommended this place by a few people I met during the first day of the show. I was in the mood for some hot wings and a good draft beer and since the place was just around the corner from my hotel, it made it the obvious choice. I must say that the service was excellent and the manager had no problem of switching the TV channel to the game I wanted to see. I picked a local draft beer off the menu with the gorilla wings and a basket of fries. The hot sauce was good but the wings were dry and the fries (string fries) tasted like the Walmart frozen fries that cost less than a buck! So, A+ for the service and beer and C- for the wings and fries..."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Majerle's in maybe 15 years but went the other night with friends before the Rush concert (they were awesome, btw). Ordered a strawberry lemonade, which was splendid and refreshing. I also got the Gorilla Wings (bone-in wings), I'd been having a hankering for wings. Being gluten free, you can imagine my surprise when they brought them out, in all their breaded glory. OY! Nary a mention of the breading on the menu, who breads their chicken wings?! [The boneless wings specifically state they are breaded] The server politely asked me what else I'd like, while everyone around me was enjoying their food, and not wanting to make us late for the concert, I ordered some french fries. They brought them to me very quickly. They did not charge me for the wings and the manager did apologize to me. 
Having said that, the other people I was with all ordered something that came with french fries, including one friend who ordered a burger. The server that brought the food (not our regular server) did not bring mustard or ketchup so we had to ask. A few minutes later, still no condiments but our regular server did stop by and we had to again ask for the condiments. What server doesn't automatically bring those condiments to a table full of people who will no doubt need them?! Seriously it's just common sense. I was not particularly enthused about my visit and, although a huge fan of Thunder Dan's, I will likely not stop in again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm always a little leery about going to Sports restaurants.  They usually lack character and the food is never impressive.  I reaffirmed this belief with my visit to Majerle's.  I ordered the soft chicken tacos, which was listed under the \"Entrees and Sandwiches\" category.  It said all entrees and sandwiches come with fries.  I was greatly looking forward to this, because my tacos were to also include chips and salsa (which I hate).  I never did receive fries with my meal.  I know tacos and fries don't normally go together, but the menu made me believe they did.  I asked the waitress why I didn't receive any fries and she replied, \"because I ordered the tacos\".  No where on the menu did it say \"Tacos do not come with fries, even though it says entrees receive fries\". It may seem like I am over-reacting about some fries, but the tacos I received were tiny and unfilling and I did not touch the chips.  Chips and salsa should be free, not part of a meal! The waitress was very unsympathetic about my issue.  When I asked her how much it would be to get a side of fries,  she insisted on showing me the price on the menu instead of just telling me, like I should have searched the menu better. The waitress never came by once to fill my cup of water, but was eager to get everyone else another beer. I sat there with an empty cup the majority of the meal. The servers in general were not very friendly. One last complaint, the chicken in the tacos were supposedly marinated in a sauce but the chicken was rather dry and bland.  I did not taste any seasoning what-so-ever. So in the end, I got 3 tiny tacos for $9...plus tip and tax. Yaaaaay I love wasting money.  Never going here again."}
{"text":"The best place in Scottsdale for any sporting event.  They have plenty of flat screens so you can always have a good view of an event.  Always enough bartenders so the service is good and you don't have to wait for drinks.  Good food too. BBQ chicken sandwich is my favorite.   They do usually charge $10 cover when there is an event on but that doesn't seem stop people from going in."}
{"text":"Like a million other sports bars with food. Not good, not bad. The guacamole is pretty good, as are the cocktails. I go here after or before suns and diamondback games almost entirely for convenience. The sliders are pretty good, too. Never been too disappointed, so I'll keep coming back, but obviously don't be looking to go here for delicious, fulfilling culinary experience."}
{"text":"Good service, food and atmosphere.  Everyone is very friendly and nobody is going to leave hungry.  Excellent location for Phoenix sporting events."}
{"text":"Went to Majerle's on Sunday for their Sunday Funday day party. I can't speak on their food but their drinks are weak, luckily we ended up getting table service. Besides that though, I had a great time. What made this day/night for me was the DJ, he was spectacular. I didn't have much hope for the Arizona scene after the night we had at INTL (nightclub a door or two down from Majerle's) with their DJ, but the DJ at this spot did his thing. 
The waitresses and management were friendly but a thing that struck me as odd here as well as from the our night at INTL, when you order bottle service, they place a lock on the bottle(s) that you've purchased and every time you desire a drink, you have to flag down a waitress or a bouncer to pour you one. I googled this foreign phenomenon and apparently it has been codified, A.R.S. §4-244 (23). The locks aren't a must, however, your drinks must be poured by an employee of the establishment. I guess they do this to ensure patrons aren't pouring their own."}
{"text":"I went to Marjerle's Sports Grill in old town scottsdale last sunday and it was by far the worst restaurant experience i've had in a long time, or maybe the worst of ALL TIME. 

First off, we sat at a table on the patio and after the server took our drink orders, it took about 30 minutes to actually receive our drinks. Whether it was her fault or the bartenders fault for the delay, she didn't even check on us or apologize for the delay during that entire 30 minutes. When my boyfriend needed a second drink, the waitress was no where to be found so he proceeded to go to the bar to get a drink. The bartender stood on her phone for about 2 minutes texting away. And then proceeded to walk apart my boyfriend waiting at the bar to go continue texting in the back. 

For food, we order a side salad and sliders; two menu items that shouldn't take longer than 10-12 minutes. Well, surprisingly, the food came out to us in about 15 minutes. Question was: is the food going to be good? NO ABSOLUTELY NOT. The bun on my 3 sliders were burnt to a crisp. But it doesn't stop there, when I looked at the meat patty of one of my sliders, it looked as if a huge bite was taken out of it! This is when I had enough. I called the waitress over, told her the issues we had, which she apologized for. I told her we didn't want to order anything else and just wanted the bill. 

For two rounds of drinks for 5 people, a crappy side salad, and burnt sliders, we paid a whopping NINETY FIVE DOLLARS for what was the WORST dining experience i have ever had. So bad, its almost funny."}
{"text":"Food was less then average the service was so slow that a sloth actually received a speeding ticket. Do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to eat if you like to feel like you are a low priority and an inconvenience for the servers. On my second to last visit, we waited for fifteen minutes before a server actually came to our table. We were about to get up and leave, but then a table across the way complained to THEIR server that they noticed we hadn't gotten service. We finally got a waitress who clearly had no time for our table.
On my experience last Sunday, we ordered and were told about 20 minutes in that our ticket had been lost and they had to retake our order. No apologies, discounts, appetizer to hold us over, etc. We were not in a hurry but had we been this could have been much worse. 
This is even more disappointing because the food is reasonably good and I like the ambiance and layout of TVs for watching games that are on. The recurring issues with service however are just not worth my time or anyone else's for that matter. There are many other sports bars in the vicinity with equal TV/food quality and MUCH better service."}
{"text":"Ordered a french dip sandwich with fries. The fries were excellent and crispy, but the sandwich could have been a little bigger. Overall, it had a nice atmosphere and the value was average."}
{"text":"Visited Majerle's for a group celebration and everyone had a blast. The food, drinks and service was great! 

Our server, Diana, did a great job and was super attentive with our group throughout the night. So Thanks Diana! 

If you've read any of my other reviews you know I'm a sucker for good wings so when at a sports bar what else would I get?!? Wings! Wings! Wings! I love Majerle's wings, especially the TC sauce. It's is definitely my go to when visiting Majerle's. 

Anyway, loved my Majerle's time and it's worth the drop in."}
{"text":"Great place to watch any type of sports.  Good beer selection and wait staff.  Walking distance to the house!"}
{"text":"in honor of the impending superbowl XLV, i wanted to write my majerles review. 

this year though, instead of hitting up a sports bar for the biggest day in football, i'll be going to a party. a real rager. if i wasn't though, i would definitely be pressed up against majerles front door bright and early superbowl morning. it's a great sports bar.

the weirdest thing about majerles is their name. someone finally told me it wasn't pronounced \"mah jer lees\" like i had thought.... it's pronounced \"mar lees\". so let me get that out first.

i'm a big sports nut.... well, let me rephrase that. i'm a big sports nut when it involves REAL sports. i won't make fun of anyone, but if it's not football, baseball, basketball or hockey i don't wanna hear about it. unless of course we're talking about extreme sports like surfing, skateboarding, etc. 

being a fan of sports makes me a fan of sports bars. there are only 3 main things i need in order for a sports bar to be great in my opinion. let me lay them out for you:

a good selection of beers, happy hour specials and bar snacks--- yes, majerles has this in spades. large selection of beers and any sports bar that has perrier jouet, vueve clicquot and dom champagnes must be praised.(mostly because i think this is absolutely hilarious. WHO orders pricey champers at a sports bar? haha!) also, put me down as a fan of their reuben reuben and tenderloin sliders. yum.

the service--- there's nothing worse than sidling up to a bar, excited to watch your team kick some ass and ordering a drink from a bartender that seems bored and unhappy. every bartender i've come in contact with at majerles truly loved being at work (or they at least acted like it). bartenders attitudes really carry a lot more weight then they realize. happy bartender =  happy bar patrons

the strategic placement of large TV sets for comfortable viewing pleasure--- yep. they designed this with real sports fans in mind. no matter where i sit, i can see a multitude of TV's with little blocking my view. 

so they have it all, and i likey. go here if you're looking for a good bar to watch the superbowl... or any sporting event for that matter. 

oh, and GO PACK GO!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a beer, some food and watch the games!! Tons of TV's.. One thing I want impressed with is that my first Sunday afternoon here, it took me 10 minutes to get a drink. A girl sitting next to me had to call her bartender friend over to serve me. Service could have been better, but maybe it was just a one time experience. I still plan on going again and hopefully a better service experience."}
{"text":"We were looking for a casual place on a Sunday night. This place was great! Plenty of TVs and the hot wings were awesome!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here a multitude of times because the food is decent and close to where we live, but especially as of late, we have gotten the WORST service. The waitresses seem like they're in some sort of clique and aren't really concerned with doing their job. We went tonight, and after 20+ minutes of waiting for our food, the waitress comes over and tells us the kitchen lost our ticket, and she retakes our order. No apology whatsoever or sentiments or anything. Our food came out after about another 15 minutes and again, no apology or anything. I thought they'd maybe at least take a little bit off our bill, but nope. They didn't even care. Pretty disappointing. While I love their Grilled Chicken Fajita Wrap, Majerle's is quickly becoming the last place on my list of places to eat due to the subsequent and consistent crappy, nonchalant service. Save your money."}
{"text":"We went there for the night life, kind of a mistake even though there was a dance floor and a DJ. Awkward dance floor and not very good music if you are wanting newer hip hop to dance to. Good bartenders though! Quick and friendly! More of a casual hang out kinda place for sure hence its name \"sports bar\"..."}
{"text":"Location; is next to BJ's at Desert Ridge, it is relatively new which you can tell they invested in upgrades.  Very nice patio sitting when the weather is allows.

Food;  On this occasion I only went to have a couple drinks before event, and the beverages are ice cold. 

Service; The bartender was super nice, and asked for my name upon sitting and called me my name the rest of the visit super service."}
{"text":"Always get the Slam Dunk Shrimp. And Gorilla wings. Both in medium sauce, very good.!! Very loud in here, always. Okay for kids early in the day. Very tight tablewise. Not a lot of space to move around between the tables. We've found service to be slow probably due to this. Decent outdoor seating just not a lot of it. Great spot to watch March Madness games!"}
{"text":"My husband has not stopped complaining since we left over an hour ago.  We ordered wings as an appetizer, which is pretty much the only thing you can eat there.  My husband got the fish tacos, in which the fish was nonexistent.  It was all batter and taco filler.  I got the beef sliders and the beef was cut very thin, so it was mostly bread.  It also needed salt as it was pretty bland.  The horseradish sauce was more like a butter and was too heavy for my taste.  There was not enough horseradish flavor in it at all.  Our waitress was very attentive and did a great job taking care of us, but the food was terrible.  Now I remember why we've never been back after going to the downtown Phoenix location 10 years ago.  My husband remarked that all the smart people were at the bar drinking because the food isn't worth it.  We won't be going back to this location or any other one."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while visiting AZ. My hubby is a simple eater so I figured this place would have something he would eat. I got the slam dunk shrimp. BOMB. I got half chili garlic pepper and half buffalo. The Potato Skins were great.  Nice and soft.  Drinks were good..I got the Vegas Margarita. Great experience."}
{"text":"we were looking for a club but apparently thursday nights most of the clubs start hopping after 11pm. we decided to stop into Majerles's instead and we had a nice time here. I ordered a kilt lifter four peaks and although I don't love beer, this one went down nice. Hubster ordered a burger and I don't really tend to eat burgers so shared his string fries. he loved the burger and his blue moon. We chatted up with our neighbors and meet a guy that looked like Kevin Bacon. :) chill place with decent music.  The only negative I did notice was that the bartender thought she was too cool for school. overall, I would still return if in the area."}
{"text":"[First time Out-of-Towner for Spring Training]

Marjele's got that AZ swag...
 
...that EVERYTING else is lagging! And by swag I am generally talking about music. Our favorite, lovely shuttle girl dropped us off here. Our options were Marjele's (pronounced Marley's) or douche central next door, blaring fist-pumping music. It was so obnoxious I can't even remember the name.
 
Celebrating my birthday 6 hours early, we wanted to grab a bite before we indulged in some libations. The girls got hot wings. The obviously enjoyed them, with their huge hot sauce grins ;)
 
The roomie and I shared the Turkey Burger and fries. The bread was so doughy, it was wonderful. I wouldn't want every burger like this, but it was a perfect complement to our tasty meal. I can't recall what Krystle R. got.
 
However, we were already enjoying the great music and good food, when we realized the music was swagtastic and that we hadn't heard such good music anywhere else we'd been so far (in AZ). A blend of old school, new school, rap, R&B, just all around greatness. We mentioned this to the server...in less than 5 minutes Corey, the manager appeared. He was smiling...apparently we made his night by complimenting his music selection, because his staff constantly complains. Doesn't say much about his staff, but tons about him - Corey knows what's up! Thus began our great friendship with Corey!
 
What should have been no more than a 2 hour, max, stay at this sports bar/restaurant, turned into closing the joint down. Literally staying until the end...it's all blurry, so I'm not sure about the time. Let just say we couldn't really collectively count the amount of rounds of shots that were taken, we made new friends, bar top dancing might have occurred, and the end was a blur. Our trip to AZ was going to be fabulous regardless, but our experience at Marjele's seriously made it that much better.

Marjele's made Sunday FUNday have a whole new meaning!!"}
{"text":"Cool joint... 

large menu : sandwiches, salads, soups, wraps, burgers etc..TV's..alcohol..indoor/outdoor seating..good service. Went during my lunch hour so speediness in the kitchen counts and food came out quickly and was pretty tasty. This place is prob best for lunch and after work drinks/snacks not sure about dinner. Was hard to sit at a bar on my lunch hour and not order a drink..i have decided taking me to a bar on my lunch hour is not such a good idea. Will have to check this place out for an after work drink sometime and see what its like and maybe up my stars on it."}
{"text":"How crazy the suns fan can be. :) its so exciting. 
Good food. Good music and karaokeeeeeee. Yuppp. It went down alright. Haha

Our waiter was slow, she apologized for everything. :/"}
{"text":"The selection is definitely lacking but it was across the street from my hotel.  The chicken sandwich was ok, but the apps weren't all that tasty.  Good place to hit up when you don't have a car!"}
{"text":"Great location if staying near the convention center or in downtown Phoenix. This is by far one of the best sports bars I have ever been to. I had a perfect view of ESPN 2 and the place had plenty of sporting events on other teles..but not too many. 

The atmosphere is fantastic and perfect for lunch. Food is great and they had vegetarian options, a major plus for a sports bar. What is better than veggie options? They made exceptions for me, my whole meal sans dairy with no complaints, evil eyes, etc. This is greatly appreciated. 

The evening scene is great also. 

An overall 5.5 stars. hellz yeah."}
{"text":"Been about a year since I came here the first time. I came during a suns game so naturally it was super packed. I took a seat at the bar and was handed a menu. The prices were pretty high... my guess is they spike them up during the game? It's possible... Either way I wasn't really too hungry but was craving something sweet. Having saw the GCU Triple Double and being a 'lope myself I decided to try it. I also ordered a Long Island Iced Tea which was a Thursday special for $4. The dessert was $6.50. In about 2 minutes my drink was brought out to me, and about 15-20 minutes my dessert... My guess is it took a while as it is a half baked cookie and had to be baked. On top of the cookie was a few scoops of ice cream, some whipped cream, and lots of chocolate sauce (I asked for extra chocolate because.... well chocolate. Overall the dessert was great. It was a little crunch on the sides, and moist and chewy in the middle... so half baked and it was huge. I may be back again if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Majerles is a regular stop for us.  The happy hour is great! I love the wings and my wife like the salads and the black bean burger.  All that we have had there is done well.

We generally sit at the bar and the service is outstanding.  Marissa, Kara and Crystal take good care of you.

There are a lot of TVs tuned in to different sports and the crowd gets lively and noisy."}
{"text":"good food, decent prices, fun atmosphere. it can be crowded! for pure sports event viewing, it would be better with all flat-screen HD sets, but you can't have everything I suppose."}
{"text":"I have been to Majerle's Sports Bar Grill once before, at the Desert Ridge location. Besides, the pleasing drinks and food, the customer service drew me in the most. This following weekend, I decided to try the Majerle's in Flagstaff, Arizona with a good friend.   

During my day visit, I was automatically greeted by numerous employees besides the hosts. This initially told me I would most likely receive great service during the rest of my visit. My waitress w1as, as well, the bartender. She was very consisted regardless of how busy she was. When ever she may have been caught up tending to others, other waiter and/or bartenders were happy to assist and made sure there were zero need for anything. 

I started off with an appetizer, Madison's skins (potato skins topped with ingredients) with chicken, replaced the bacon; which was just tasty as I expected. How can I forget to mention that we received the appetizer approx. 10 minutes after ordering, beyond how crowded it became.

     While my friend and I enjoyed our starter we decided to enjoy some Tequila Tonics; and our bartender made the beverages just as we like it (chilled with lime and salt around the rim).

Shortly, after we received our entrees. I ordered ,The Lumberjack Chicken sandwich, without tomato. I must admit, I was afraid the grill chicken would turn out dry; but it was the opposite. My friend ordered, The Slam Duck Shrimp, buffalo sauce as a choice of flavor. Both entrees were fresh and warm, and they were both filling. We were obviously satisfied; and had no choice, but to enjoy the rest of our visit at this sports grill.

My experience at Sports Grill leaves me with no complaints; because overall the service was to be expected. I definitely recognized the consistent customer service, regardless, of the restaurant's location! Majerle's Sports Grill may just be one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday during lunch. The restaurant was not busy but a welcoming atmosphere. Drinks were ordered fast but the waitress never came back to take our food order. After 10 minutes we flagged down the manager who took our order. 

My chicken taco salad was basically a bowl of salad with 5 small cubes of chicken and jalapeños. When I complained they took 20% off the bill which was less that the actually salad cost. 

End of story- still starving. Husbands chicken quesadilla was good though."}
{"text":"We have been to Majerles numerous times before. However this time we were appalled the poor customer experience. We were there on a Monday night during a football game. The appetizer took 30 minutes to come out and the single entree took 45 minutes after that. The kitchen was backed up but these times are unacceptable. We likely will not be back which is a shame since we like watching games there and enjoyed our precious meals there. ."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times... and will base this review on that collective experience.

First, for those not from the PHX area or familiar with basketball players, try not to call this place \"Maa-jer-lees\"... unless you have an Australian or English accent and then it doesn't make a difference what you call it because people will still think it sounds totally cool.

Second, drinks almost always arrive the way I expect them to be made.  So a Grey Goose and 7 with a lime tastes, well, like a Grey Goose and 7 with a lime!  But beer never tastes like a Grey Goose and 7 with a lime.  Right now you're probably wondering how many times I am going to say Grey Goose and 7 with a lime in this post, right?  None, I promise...

Third, food.  The wings are good, not great... Slam Dunk Shrimp are pretty excellent... chicken quesadilla is damn good... and sandwiches have all been pretty good.  Now that is not exactly a scientific measuring system, but it's the best you're going to get in this review!

Fourth, ambiance.  It's a bar.  There are TVs that are good for watching the game (or games).  There are pretty hot waitresses.  Well done, Mr. Majerle!"}
{"text":"It's not my favorite place but it's convenient.  We needed to get a bite to eat there before a concert at the symphony Hall.  It lacks choices for non meat eaters. Otherwise it is ok for most patrons."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food.....I had a liquid dinner the night I went in.

One thing is for certain in this place: Anywhere you sit, you will see a TV. Walls of TV. Like more than Best Buy. So a good place to go if you want to catch a game.

Decent selection of draft beers.

I'd check it out again."}
{"text":"Disappointed to pay $8 for a 12oz beer in a plastic cup.  Food was pricey for the quality ($14 for frozen chicken fingers??) and menu was really limited.  I never leave bad reviews - but was really unimpressed with this place.  On the bright note - our server was nice."}
{"text":"Horrible! 4tables open! Had to wait...... don't know why? 15 minutes later I asked the host what the wait is for, \"she said it's for the best service for the customer\".  I think we are the only 2 people waiting with 3 tables and one booth available! No wonder you can't get people in!"}
{"text":"This place is right next to El Hefe, and I think El Hefe is a lot better.  Still, this might be a better place to actually watch sports, especially football because they have more TVs.  It's very nice inside and they have inside and outside tables. It's Scottsdale so not cheap of course. Service was good when I went."}
{"text":"Eh, the food wasn't that great.  I had the blue cheese burger and instead of actual blue cheese crumbles, it contained runny blue cheese salad dressing.  The service was good.  We were seated fast and the waitress was friendly and efficient.  And we had a good view of the game.  I have been here before and had better food so hopefully this was a one time incident."}
{"text":"I have been to this Majerle's a couple times and have also been to the one in downtown Phoenix. I will say, I am not a fan. I went with my family earlier this week for my brother's going away dinner. My brothers love this place....not sure why, but they do. We were there during happy hour, so at least the prices were reasonable. One of my brother's got the gorilla wings and I had one....they are sort of bland and nothing too special. I also tried one barbeque wing that I did not care for. My mom got a reuben and said it was one of the worst she has had and that she makes better at home....and my mom is not terribly picky. Their one good quality was that they carry Four Peaks Peach, which I like. This is not a place I would choose to spend my money in again."}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch and thought that it was alright. The place is much bigger than it looks from outside and has pretty cool decorations for a sports bar. The food was just alright. We got the gorilla wings with garlic and chili sauce and they were very good. They had a crispy skin and the sauce was mild but tasty. I had the sir charles chicken sandwich and it was really dry. There was too much bread and not much sauce on it. It was a very generic chicken sandwich and I would not order it again. I guess if you are looking for a sports bar, this is alright, but maybe stick to the apps."}
{"text":"The Bloody Mary was good, but somehow they messed up our order for food at the bar . . . Waited 40 min for 2 appetizers, and when we asked they told us they mixed up the order and we'd wait another 15 minutes. Nope."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, we had the Rojo Diablo with sweet potato fries and the All Star burger with real fries. Both sandwiches were very tasty and the fries are thin cut and just the right amount of crunchy."}
{"text":"Attended the massive Big Red Rage show for the Cards' final home game against the Seachickens. 3 of us had burgers and it was the best burger I've had in as long as I can remember. Minus one star for crappy fries. But the burger I'd do again for sure. Service was good, especially considering the mod scene in the joint that night. Will visit again soon."}
{"text":"I took my two children here after going to the museum on a Saturday afternoon.  I ordered a fruit plate to start with and then we were going to share a hamburger.  She asked how I'd like it cooked and I said \"medium\".  

When my fruit plate was dropped off by another person, no silverware or napkins were left.  We started eating the fruit with our fingers.  The waitress walked by and saw us.  I assumed she was going to get silverware.  But then I didn't see her again until she brought the hamburger.  There were so many things wrong at this time.  First, the fact that I had to ask for silverware and napkins in a restaurant is absurd.  Especially seeing that I have 2 children under the age of 4.  I obviuosly need napkins!  But the hamburger was WELL done and absolutely tasteless.  There was nothing on it.  I had to ask for mustard.  When I ordered the hamburger I told her it was for us 3 to split.  She just brought over the hamburger on one plate with no extras.  I had to cut the hamburger into pieces and tear one of our drink napkins to put the burgers on for my kids.
At this point I was so annoyed and tired and wanted to leave.  I asked for the check when she finally walked by a few minutes later (she never came by to ask how anything was).  I didn't even want to bother complaining and waiting to get more food.  After a long day, I just wanted to leave.  But I would never come back again."}
{"text":"Fun to hangout here during Sunday football! Also fun place to watch baseball games on TV. It can get pretty busy before the PHX teams have home games, but other than that it's pretty decent. They have great specials on Sunday morning/afternoons on beer, Bloody Marys and Mimosas. Sandwiches are great. If you haven't tried the Traverse City wings you haven't LIVED! Service is decent, not the best downtown, but certainly not the worst. I find if you sit at the bar you'll get more attention than at a table when it gets busy."}
{"text":"Mediocre sports bar. The place is clean and looks nice, but honestly there is nothing that really sets it apart from any other place around town.

One issue I have is the lack of selections for someone that eats vegetarian/vegan. Even some pretzel bites or hummus would be nice."}
{"text":"Was in dtown phoenix area during NCAA sweet sixteen thought I would stop in and watch basketball games only to find out the sound is not played. I thought this was a basketball bar??! I dont think Dan would approve. :("}
{"text":"So pissed off at this place! I went here to watch the Rangers-Panthers hockey game and they had it in the small TV in the upper right hand corner...not a big deal. I figured I would ask if they could change it. Well, I didn't get a chance to ask because the bartender never even acknowledged me. I literally stood there for 10 minutes and not even a, \"I'll be right with you.\" I watched as she served other people who already had drinks but when it came to me...nothing. I walked out never to return again."}
{"text":"Had been going almost 1 year for trivia on Tuesdays...staff is great but
the food is terrible...finally found another place for trivia that actually
has tasty food.....the food was so bad that LITERALLY every person
that had joined me for trivia over year without exception had the same
reaction with respect to the food....

I am amazed how nothing has ever been done to address the awful food quality"}
{"text":"I was here for happy hour and trivia with friends.  We got 2nd place!  They run trivia very well.  Get the buffalo wings here when you get the chance!  I ordered the buffalo wings (with the bone) and when they arrived, each wing had the perfect amount of sauce on it.  It wasn't runny, but it wasn't breaded either.  The sauce was able to just stick on the wings!  I gotta come here again!"}
{"text":"Everytime I go to Majerle's I leave wondering why I ever went in the 1st place.  The service is BAD most of the time, the bartenders have attitudes & the beer selection is sub par.  I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because for some reason I wind up going  back, usually to meet friends.  Im never impressed by any part of their service, menu or price structure.   How can up consistently mess up sliders? Yes EVERY TIME. I ran into Thunder Dan once, thats got to be worth somthing right?"}
{"text":"Burger was ordered medium rare; it was perfectly cooked and juicy. Shoestring fries were delicious. No complaints whatsoever.  Front bar (East) was noisy (full of happy patrons), but the back bar was quieter. Great sports bar!"}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot. I came in after a game and sat for a while having a few beers waiting for a friend to show up.  I had a really good Reuben sandwich.  The crowd was pretty friendly   Nice kinda upscale restaurant / sports bar.  Not sure how many more times I will be back in Phoenix Az but if I do, I would check this out again.  Really close to the sports arena as well.  Big plus."}
{"text":"Corey is the man!!!!!!

It was first time in Snots-dale or some even call it Snobs-dale, AZ for the SF Giants spring training and my girlfriends and I really had an Amazing time at Majerle's Sports Grill.....

We walked in based on the fact that we were hungry, the music and vibe of the place was what we wanted to start the night with. I especially loved the fact that this spot had about 25 huge Samsung flat screens on every wall ( a real sports grill better have a tv on every wall)!!!!! 

The food, the service, and especially the manager/DJ ( Corey) really made it that much more of a hot spot throughout the night for my gf's and I that we could NOT seem to leave. We celebrated  Stephanie G's 29th b-day like a bunch of classy GIRLS GONE WILD that night! 

I can't wait to visit the staff and dance the night away while watching the BEST hip hop and r&b videos on all those awesome TV's!!! 

Until next year Majerle's =)"}
{"text":"Cool hopping spot! Thankfully we were able to snag an outdoor table the night before St. Patty's - great service and of course a hefty bill for a party of 10 but its all good. Fun to just people watch in that area, as there's a lot of hot spits to hit up. Interesting music choices at the bar and it was nice to be so close to a bar that wasn't completely filled up. Easy to navigate the bathrooms and no line. Love it."}
{"text":"Came a friday night at around midnight for some drinks with friends. REALLY LOUD techno music with a sad story from Fox News playing on all the TV screens. I just can't figure out this bar out. From the looks of this scarce bar, neither can anyone else. Shame because it looks like a great sports bar during the day. They just need to figure out their night scene."}
{"text":"Love this place. We came left Hi Fi and came here to grab drink. This is probably one of the best sport bars in old town and the service is always great. they just need to change their music from rap to top 40"}
{"text":"Good chill spot after a game. Old school music videos in the background where it makes you reminisce of the good old days. Crowd vary in age and are there for a fun time. Drinks are cheap.

Here's the downfall. Food didn't look appetizing. Generic food that looks as if it came from a frozen box and was heated in a microwave. Wouldn't be surprised. I would stay away from there drink specials. It may be cheap but thats because there's no alcohol! My friend ordered a blue hurricane for $4 but asked for a shot for it since there was no hint of alcohol whatsoever. With the shot it came out to $12. So much for drink specials. They ordered another drink special in hopes it would be better. Fail. Sad to say but they returned it. Stick with beer. You can't go wrong with the flavor and amount of alcohol in it"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our lunch. Burger was good. Reuben was excellent. French dip was pretty good. Shoestring fries were yummy. Nachos were good but not one bit warm. Service wasn't very good. We had to ask for iced tea refills. Never got water refills. Never got asked if we wanted 2nd bar beverages. Server brought ticket without asking if we wanted anything else."}
{"text":"A really fun place with an awesome staff. The food is really good too and our server Erica was on point. They have a simple menu with nice variety and decent drink selection. I had the signature mushroom burger and it was perfect and juicy. Definitely coming back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"More than a sports grill--really great food & atmosphere. Mall really lucky to have such a non-chain restaurant amongst is list of usuals!"}
{"text":"The original & same location for almost 20 yrs which is unheard of in the highly competitive restaurant biz! Great food n atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Update 9/30/15 - Still no improvement to Happy Hour and no Fireside discount. Cmon guys, get up to speed."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service sitting at the bar! Food was average and ambiance too was perhaps bellow average..  not planning on returning any time soon. But bartender was on point, nice blonde gal!"}
{"text":"I went to a Majerle's near US Airways Arena after a Suns game, and it was a lot of fun, but it was very packed inside.  Unlike the one in downtown Phoenix, this one in Scottsdale is more spacious.  The place has a great amount of sports running from hockey to basketball.  There are televisions at almost any angle you are sitting, so you never have a bad seat in the house.

The food is pretty decent for bar food.  I got a chicken salad of some sort when I visited.  I didn't have a beer that night, but my friends kept ordering away, so it must have been good.

Dan Majerle would be proud of this establishment that has a great sports vibe."}
{"text":"I have been a regular here since it opened and only for one reason. Simply the best Rueben sandwich in town."}
{"text":"Decent sports bar. Small place but wasn't too crowded for a Saturday afternoon of football watching. Average to good bar food but they didn't have any good drink specials on which is always disappointing."}
{"text":"Always have a great time here.. attentive staff. Good drinks and fun. Nothing else is necessary"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken sandwich, it was sad, and cold. I ordered chicken wings, no flavor and cold. Everything was stale and not good. O ordered 70.00 worth of food and that was the last time. Dont waste your money on crappy food."}
{"text":"Walking into this place for the first time, I thought to myself: Wow, this is nothing like the one in Scottsdale.  The restaurant was new and clean with good a/c.  And the bar area looked like someplace I would actually want to hang out.  Later, thru more experience, I realized that there are actually a lot of similarities.  Same bad service, which ranges from snobby to forgetful and nonexistent.  Same mediocre boring bar food.  Same overpriced drinks.

The only thing I really like about Majerle's is that they have good music and they show music videos on a couple of the TVs.  That gives those of us who are not sports fanatics something to look at and also ups the overall coolness factor of the place.  This location does have that as well but it is completely offset by the fact that there are usually a bunch of kids around.  I know we are in the suburbs and close to the mall but when did it become OK to bring a baby to a bar.  Seriously?  I wish they would repeal the smoking ban just so that us dinks would have someplace to go where we could enjoy happy hour without screaming kids running around."}
{"text":"WOOF. Terrible service. Mediocre food. One of the worst experiences I've had a restaurant in a while. And I feel validated since many other reviews are similar to mine.

Came here on a Thursday night for a college basketball game. The place was busy, as there were multiple March Madness and NBA games on, but not packed. After we were seated, we didn't see our waitress for 20 minutes and when she finally did come she asked \"if we were ok.\" Although we had gotten there in time for happy hour, we now had 5 minutes to decide before happy hour was over. This was made especially difficult because they don't have a printed happy hour menu! We asked the waitress what the specials were and she listed out each item and price (not an overarching \"$2 off apps, $3 drafts\", etc). Not sure how we (or she, for that matter) were supposed to remember the specials to order from memory. 

Welp, that would be one of three total times we saw her over the course of two and half hours. At the end of our meal, it was impossible to get our check as she was nowhere to be found and the other wait staff didn't come near our table for us to ask about a check.

Food was mediocre. I got wings which I thought were pretty hard to screw up at a sports bar. But the medium wing sauce was flavorless and the chicken itself was overcooked. For $11 wings? Pass.

With so many great bars and restaurants downtown, you bet I won't be back here ever again."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times but never for dinner. This time we had complete meals. Simple sports bar interior, with no shortage of tv's. We received service quickly and our drinks shortly thereafter. Our food took awhile and I would have liked a refill on my beverage but our server was no where to be found. When we did get our food the  Rojo Diablo was the best meal although it is strange they don't serve lettuce and tomatoes with a chicken sandwich. The cheeseburger sliders came on plain burnt buns. Our server brought new buns but even then there are better sliders out there. The taco salad was okay, but really none of this knocked out socks off.  Maybe a little more effort in the kitchen would make a big difference. It is a good place for wings and watching a game."}
{"text":"Slow, inattentive service. Chicken tortilla soup was, essentially, flavorless. Fish tacos had so little fish they should be called slaw/cheese tacos with a fish garnish. Overall, I was underwhelmed. Go for the wine and beer - stick to apps."}
{"text":"RYAN..Runs the staff in a way that I wish every Sports bar would. This is our new place because of his staff. Thanks for always stepping up. Oh and Zack is a awesome bartender and always has a smile 4 his customers."}
{"text":"So some of the food here is great. But overall the place is just average but it's a nice place to watch the game or have happy hour. I've never really had outstanding service here but everyone is nice once they finally get to you. I would go back it just wouldn't be my top choice for happy hour or dinner."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town! This place of definitely my go to when I'm craving a good burger!"}
{"text":"One big meh

Beer...not cold
Boneless wings...adequate
Celery and carrots...good
Service...inattentive at best dismissive at worst

Oh...I forgot to mention...World Series game on and MNF...place was sparsely occupied.  Mediocre everything won't put butts in the seat even with the World Series and MNF on TV.  Some one in the management food chain should look into the issues with this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday for a quick lunch with the kids after a visit to the Science Center.  The service was TERRIBLE.  Worst experience as a mom ever!!  The waitress, Abriana, did not have customer service skills whatsoever.  Our orders came out incorrect, figures since she didn't even write them down.  After we informed her that the orders were wrong, she proceeded to tell us that we were wrong and this is what we ordered.  Kids have been waiting almost 35 minutes for the food now.  We had the manager come over.  He apologized for the error and waited on us the rest of the visit. Food was good, but the service was not up to par.  We would not go back."}
{"text":"If you have a large group, it would help if the heaters didn't go out/never even turn on when it's 48 degrees outside at night.  More weren't working than were.  Seating wasn't that great outside on top of that.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"This place was dead when we went there Thursday.  Despite being bummed about the lack of customers, our waitress was friendly, personable and even shared some stories about the Majerles.  

I only had a drink and The Hawks Legendary Cheese Fries.  The fries were actually amazing. I want some right now!  

I will definitely return to Majerle's because the waitress was so sweet.  In fact, the next time I am in Old Town I think I will have dinner there."}
{"text":"One of the more iconic sports bars in Phoenix is Majerles. Named for and run by Dan Majerles of the Phoenix Suns, this bar sits just one block away from the arena and tends to host some of the rowdier crowds during the Suns games. Majerles is consistently ranked one of the top sports bars in the country by Sports Illustrated. This accolade is well deserved.

Majerles is small but laid out well with the bar in the center with smaller high-tops encircling it with booths along the outer wall. This system works well for the different types of crowds that come into Majerles. There is also outdoor seating and usually a scantily-clad hostess standing with them.

Nothing special about the menu but everything is good. The Chicago burger, with its blue cheese, is a personal favorite. The bar features the usual selection of domestics and imports as well as specialty liquor.

This is not really a kid-friendly environment but there is nothing to suggest they shouldn't attend. Because the bar is more intertwined with the restaurant and the waitresses are usually minimally dressed, Cooper's Town might make a better impression on the younger ones. The food is better there too."}
{"text":"I was here by myself on Sunday night while in Phoenix downtown. It seemed to be a great place to watch sports while dining by yourself or with a  bunch of friends. The wait time was less then 10 minutes and the wait staff were friendly. 

I ordered chicken tenders which were served with some fries. The crust was crunchy and well seasoned with a tasty and juicy interior. Fries were my favorite. They are thinly sliced and spice rub was on spot. 

Overall, I recommend this place if you are a sports person and are looking for a place to watch some sports while you drink and dine!"}
{"text":"The bar is just \"okay\" but definitely wouldn't recommend it to all woman group or for a hangout place, more of a quick pit stop type place or if your in the neighborhood... The staff are a bunch a woman and not very friendly at all (super snobby if you ask me)... for what that's worth, the food is okay not the best not the worst, beers about $4 other alcoholic beverages about $7."}
{"text":"the yelpers are spot on with the majerlita with grand marnier...as a beer drinker this is delicious.   Marissa our bartender was very personable.  She was great.  I have been having a difficult time finding decent chips and salsa.  Either the chips are stale or the salsa is from a jar.  NOT HERE! The chips were fresh, salsa was great, right amount but not too much heat.  Guacamole is definitely  fresh cause it is amazing....stop by the chandler mall location...give it a try its very good.  We were here on a Saturday around 1pm."}
