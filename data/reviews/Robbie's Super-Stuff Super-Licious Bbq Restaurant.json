{"text":"I just got a full slab from Robbie's and the first rib I bit into was not cooked through! Cool pink meat, not smoke ring pink but uncooked pink! The rib was the absolute opposite of tender. I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"I went here on a whim after reading some great reviews about this place on here. This place has THE best BBQ ribs I've ever had. The Mac and cheese is also fantastic, everyone here is incredibly friendly as well. I can not wait to come back and try more of their food everything was excellent."}
{"text":"We chose Robbie's after reading some of the Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed at all! Robbie and his wife serve up some of the finest BBQ you'll ever have. And they are some of the nicest, most wholesome people you'll ever meet. But don't be alarmed by the ambience (or lack thereof) as the food is what Robbie's is all about.   You'll get paper plates, plastic utensils and a roll of paper towels for napkins. Again, don't let that bother you. Robbie and his wife are truly good folk who love serving up great food. Three of us were all impressed with the collard greens, potato salad, Mac 'n cheese and cornbread. They were out of coleslaw or we would've tried that as well.   As we dug into the delicious side dishes, Robbie's wife warned us to save room for the ribs. Wow!! She was not kidding as these were some of the meatiest, tastiest and tender ribs we'd ever had. But more amazing is none of us could finish a \"half\" slab even though we were loving these ribs. One of Robbie's ribs has the equivalent meat of six baby back ribs.   We strongly recommend this true \"hole in the wall\" gem of a BBQ joint. Will definitely be back next time we're in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot. Dont judge it by the appearance, seems like a little hole in the wall- the RIBS ARE SLAMMING.  Best ribs ive had, and Renee is a sweet little sassy woman who knows her BBQ.  She has a great personality and makes you feel at home.  My first time here, i got the ribs with a mustard sauce, collard greens and mac and cheese.   I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Ordering food is next to impossible. Everytime I call and say I want to place a pick up order, the woman replies with \"Well, Depends on what you want\". None of the food is ever ready.. There is ALWAYS at least an HOUR WAIT. I don't understand how they are still open. It's a hole in the wall place but the food is good. I honestly just wish they would get their act together. There is no reason that they would be open all day and at 7:00 pm none of the food is cooked."}
{"text":"Pretty easy to find.  It is the first stop after Vincent Pizza Park.  The ribs were very meaty and tender.  I usually can eat a whole slab, but the half slab was more than enough for me.  I like hot Bbq sauce, but I made sure she diluted the bbq sauce, probably 4-1 mild to hot after I had a sample of the hot.  The sauce is ok, not the best.  Simply put the Mac and cheese is the best I ever had.  It is incredible with big chunks of cheese.  The greens were very good  and had turkey in them.  The food itself was close to a 4 star rating, but Robbie's wife was very personable and made sure we enjoyed our meal.  The place has substance and character."}
{"text":"Best Mac'n Cheese and cornbread I've ever had. Ribs were a little underdone but we took home the leftovers and after cooking a little longer the next day they were delicious."}
{"text":"Robbie's is the definitive mom and pop place in Pittsburgh. They were so nice that I felt compelled to write a review with the small hope it will help them succeed. I ordered take out ribs and mac and cheese from here. When I arrived Robbie and his wife were putting my food in the bag. They lowered the price of my Mac and cheese because it was the last of it and they didn't want to charge me full price and handed me a free can of soda because it was my first time. We talked for a few minutes and I was on my way.  The ribs were great. Cooked to just the right texture. I got my ribs with the Hot barbecue sauce, which they told me they've had to tone down a little lately, and it was very good. It was more barbecue with a subtle kick. I would probably get something other than the Mac next time, but that might be biased because of it being the last of it all.  I think the best part about Robbie's is that they called me the next day to make sure I was happy with my order. Robbie said on the phone that he tries to do that with all new customers and it really added a touch of that classic mom and pop feel."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to this restaurant for the first time today. It's the best BBQ ribs I have had in my life. Its grilled to perfection. The hot sauce is incredible. We found a Groupon deal, but even without a discount, considering how delicious the food is, absolutely the best place to have BBQ ribs. The owner Robbie is charming and genuine. He even gave us a tour of his self designed grill. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Robbie's is hands down the best barbeque in Pittsburgh!!! Mom and pop atmosphere, super friendly and sooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"I found this place only when I bought a groupon and it's a pity that Robbie's restaurant was not advertised before. The bbqs are divine! The meat comes off the bone and just melts in your mouth. I come from California all the way to Pittsburgh and Robbie showed me what real southern bbq tastes like.  If you ask him, Robbie would take you to show you the grills-- there are three different ones and all meats stay separated, so if you don't eat (say) pork or beef you should not be worried about him using the same utensils or grills."}
{"text":"Really good BBQ, and friendly staff.  Definitely a great local gem!"}
{"text":"First of all, you have to love Robbie's just for their spectacular moniker. And it really is super-licious super-stuff that they're serving up in this unassuming, blink-and-you'll-miss-it joint on Ardmore Boulevard. Oh, my...the food. So far, we've sampled the wings, 1/2 chicken, pork ribs and beef ribs. The chicken and pork ribs stand out - succulent, savory, peck-it-off-the-bone good. And the sides. The corn bread is substantial and buttery, studded with sweet kernels of corn. The mac and cheese is homemade perfection, cheesy baked goodness with the top browned perfectly. Order a large. Renee is a hoot to chat with while she takes care of business behind the counter. This place is the real deal."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that had a friend not bought a Groupon, I never would have even heard of it, never having had any need whatsoever to travel in that direction.  But my friend is a Groupon fanatic, and knowing that I am a meat fanatic, he decided he'd buy this deal, and check it out.  So we initially set off one Friday evening to find this place, which is way out on Ardmore Blvd., past the usual strip malls that infest the area, and WHOOPS...there it was...we just passed it.  CRAP...right in the middle of a construction zone from hell, which meant driving another two miles before we could find a place to turn around, then pass the place again to find another place to turn around to get back to it.  But there it was, right next to the old Vincent's Pizza Park on Ardmore Blvd.  We pulled into the lot, which was empty, and went inside to discover that for Groupon deals, we had to call ahead, and the lady wasn't ready to serve anything yet anyway, she'd just gotten there.  Soooo, off we went and planned to try again another time.  Well, this evening was our second try. And this time, we called ahead. He ordered a combo deal, which included a half chicken, half slab of ribs, two sides, and four sodas.  Three of us went, and I have to say, I'm really glad we did.  Now the place is an absolute hole in the wall kind of joint. The type of place that has been reincarnated 2,000 times as failed restaurant attempts along the roadside. You are not going to find any kind of 'atmosphere' except hole in the wall. Period.  But what you ARE going to find is some killer awesome BBQ.  This is exactly the kind of place I love...unassuming on the outside (and in this case on the inside as well) but with a fine product that will make you want more.  There was one woman there, the same lady both times, and older woman slightly on the 'what do you want?' side initially, but when we sat down to eat our order, she warmed up and was actually a very cool gal.  The ribs were perfect, and I'm not much of a normal rib fan.  meaty, cooked just right, not dry, or gummy, and the sauce was incredible.  The chicken was falling off the bone, and in the same sauce. The sides were basic, cole slaw and potato salad, and their sodas were excruciatingly limited AND (gag) Pepsi products. They had exactly three...Pepsi, Orange Crush and Grape Crush.  BUT, the meat...oh, the meat.  It was absolute delish, and the sauce was heavenly.  My friend ordered 'hot'.  Normally, in da burgh, when someone says 'Oh, it's REEEEEEALLY hot', I shrug my shoulders and say 'Yeah, ok, whatever'.  Well, this is the second place in da burgh that I have experienced HOT as exactly that. I can only assume that habaneros or scotch bonnets are involved. This was more burn than jalapenos could ever be, and nothing like cayenne. This was tingle your tongue for twenty minutes hot.  PERFECT!  For once, hot meant hot!  The prices may seem a little high for such a hole in the wall, but hey, the bottom line is that you're going for BBQ, and you want GOOD BBQ.  And that's exactly what you're going to get. The rest is no frills.  In fact if 'no frills' could COME with no frills, this would be it. But you are going to get a mouthful of hot, awesome meat...and you're gonna like it!  They do recommend calling ahead to lessen your 'wait'. You can eat in, or take out. Eat in for an 'experience', or just take it out, set up your table, and enjoy!  It really is worth a visit."}
