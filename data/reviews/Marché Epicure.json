{"text":"A lot of Russian products, found pretty much almost everything. Also there is a little cafeteria where u can eat some Russian salads."}
{"text":"It has loads crammed into this smallish space.   Definitely specializes in Euro products, I noted Polish & Russian, especially for sodas & perogies.  The candy section is large.  I love the mille feuilles and eclairs (when they have them 8/10 times they are sold out); why don't they make more?  From the survey questions this establishment seems to be classed as an eatery? It is a supermarket.  It used to be part of Pare Lanes bowling alley."}
{"text":"Excellent choix de produits de Russie et pays voisins.poissons fumés et marinades pour accompagner la vodka.patisserie qui fait peur.bon comptoir de plats préparés .personnel serviable .souhaitons leur longue vie,mais profitons en tout de suite"}
{"text":"Cheap, but pretty bad food-wise. They have an amazing selection of European chocolates and I haven't tried their baked goods, but the hot food is really not great. Very heavy, creamy and/or oily. They also towed my friends car!"}
{"text":"I LOVE shopping in this supermarket! Since I have 0 knowledge about Eastern europe/Rossian cuisine, it is very fun to discover lots imported products which I can't even tell salty or sweet, every time I go there. They have various pickles, cakes, deli products as well in those regions' style, and I am very happy to try them while being in Canada. Good concept and plz keep up your great job!   For beginners like me, try ice-cheese(like ice-cream but made with cottage cheese)! you are gonna love it!"}
{"text":"My source for great Polish chocolate  I've been here twice so far.   This grocery store features imported European specialties, especially in the sweets department.  I was delighted to find chocolate from Poland here.  I fell in love with Polish chocolates at a food trade show a couple of years ago, so I was thrilled to find a handsome selection of international bars and bulk sweets.  Goplana is my current fave.  It's a bit out of the way for me, but I will definitely be back to try some other goodies."}
{"text":"I love going to Epicure! What distinguishes this place from other grocery stores is its specialization in Eastern European countries' product. You will find all the traditional sections of an ordinary grocery store (veggies, dairy products, caterer, delicatessen, and snacks) but with an eastern european twist.  I especially like their takeaway section (always useful when in need of a quick homemade dinner), their large selection of Kinder products (chocolaaaaate!!) and the friendly and helpful staff. I highly recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"It was my favorite market until I bought two packs of marshmallow there. Tasted strange, so, I've checked for expiry date. On the stamp place I found a Nutrition Value sticker, covering date stamp. Carefully I took it off. One box - stamp was obviously removed. Second box - still there and two and a half month expired on the moment of purchase. My first big disappointment in this store."}
{"text":"A great grocery full of northern european delicacies. If you are looking for something imported from europe or some special cut of meat/fish. It's the place you should go."}
{"text":"I love this place so far! There is fresh fruit and veg, frozen items, a big selection of sweets, cold-cuts, cheeses, a hot item case, salad bar, bakery, and breads! It's kind of small and cramped in some areas, but so far everything I tried has been good. They carry bread from Premier Moisson now, so they seem to be listening to what customers want. I tried a filo pastry with spinach and feta, some salads, cold-cuts and cheeses yesterday, and they all were good. I tried some pickled cherry tomatoes, and they also have pickled apples and other things to try if you're so inclined. Too bad I moved away, because this place would be somewhere I shop often if I still lived in Montreal."}
{"text":"Made a quick pit stop on way to work, to get some basil & a baguette. Good luck! No fresh herbs or baguettes or \" real\" bread for sale...only the pre-packaged plastic bagged yuck stuff! I wasn't impressed, with a name such as Epicure, I expected more and better. Meh!"}
{"text":"It was cool. I walked in there not looking for anything in particular or not knowing what it was. I walked out empty handed but for the chocolate lover, they had quite a large selection. The fruits and veggies seemed a bit pricey. Besides that, to be honest with you, I did not check anything else out."}
{"text":"Vaste choix des produits internationaux, russe , arabe etc etc, fromages , charcuterie, terrasse disponible pour manger sur place les plats preparés du jour."}
