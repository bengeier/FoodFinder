{"text":"I was to Crooked River on Saturday Dec 12, for our third year in a row for Breakfast with Santa. We had always had a pleasant experience until this day. I had a coupon on my phone and the manager would not accept it, yet no where did it say it needed printed. When I got a coupon today- almost a week later it says to print, hmm ? Then I left a message on facebook that was negative and somehow it disappeared and I can't respond because I was blocked.  Not the way to treat customers !  And that doesn't even begin to explain the food, or should I call it overpriced and overcooked ?!"}
{"text":"Outside on the porch is more comfortable than the chairs inside, but the iced tea is strong and the service friendly wherever you sit.  Dinner Review:  We haven't had the experience the other reviewer described... our fried mac and cheese was a bit greasy... but... um... it's FRIED... it was warm and gooey on the inside and that is all we were really looking for.  Our entrees didn't take any that long and the beverages were refilled quickly and with a smile.   We ordered some desserts to go and enjoyed the crisp cannoli and the dark chocolate cake."}
