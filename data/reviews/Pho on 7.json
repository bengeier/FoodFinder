{"text":"Me and the gf went here because I got the $10 or $20 Goupon.  Gosh, were we disappointed.  I ordered a large rare beef pho and the gf ordered beef and viet. sausage combination rice.  She got 3 thin slices of viet. ham NOT sausage and a few slices of beef.  My pho looked promising because of the amount of noodles I saw in the bowl but one sip of the soup and I knew we would never be going back there.  The soup base was lacking some spices and they also need to get their portions right.  My bowl was 4/5 noodle, 1/5 soup base.

Anyways, there are better places to have pho so this place will be on my avoid list."}
{"text":"These guys need to get their act together. The menu keeps changing and their pho quality/taste as well. Broth lacking in depth of flavour (which, I guess is just salty water) and noodles are over cooked. Quantity of meat is so little that you can't help but feel ripped off. Too bad, I really wanted this place to succeed b/c I live so close to it. I hope they somehow get it together. As of now, I'm staying away.."}
{"text":"I got the groupon deal and dropped in pho on 7 today. As i walked in, it looked pretty nice. Looks clean and new, but unfortunately the food isnt. The pho soup was bland. BLAND!! I dont know how else to explain it. The beef was hard -_- couldnt chew it down so i just spat it out. Basil as dead as can be. I left midway through eating and went to minerva owl at first markham place for better food.
Avoid this! Dont get sucked in by the groupon deal!"}
{"text":"Pho on 7 is a good place, its not that bad for pho, but its not the cheapest place either. Portion sizes are good, but I usually get the L which is pretty filling, but if you really want to get full, you will go for the XL. I've noticed though, that they give little meat, and give you more noodle/

Overall soup base is fine, at least you don't feel thirsty afterwards, and service is decent. Would go back but occasionally, as there are cheaper vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"3rd time here... and each and everytime was due to its proximity to my family doctor who was in the same plaza and I just come here after my doctors appointment - should have made the effort to drive back over to First Markham Place to VIP...

On my most recent visit I ordered the $8 Satay Pho. I've tried this pho at various places - Lemongrass (16th & Leslie), Vic Hong BBQ House (MajorMac & Bayview) and VIP (First Markham Place). All 3 places actually uses a satay soup base which gives the broth a distinct and flavorful taste from the regular beef pho broth.

What does Pho on 7 do? They just gave me a regular beef pho then added a tiny spoon of REAL SATAY peanut sauce and a couple slices of pineapple. WTF? It tasted weird and I couldn't tell if I was eating beef Satay Skewers or Beef Pho!

For $8, I could get an XL Satay Pho at VIP and pack some home!

The only good thing about this place is their smoothie - the avocado one I had was delicious so I will come back for take outs only and treat this as another \"BBTea\" place that sells food..."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a whim after getting my nails done, at first glance it's a relatively clean place. It says soft open on the door and to expect slow service. Prices seem reasonable, 7.97 for an extra large bowl of noodles. 3.44 for spring rolls.
Then the food shows up. The amount of noodles in the XL is about the amount you'd expect in the large. Soup more than noodles. The soup was rather cool. The spring rolls are average, portioned to price. The lime soda has more sugar and soda than there is lime! 
Not a repeat for me."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews here I purchased a Groupon Now and decided to squarely face the \"unknown\".

I told the wait staff that we were using a groupon and that we would like the compulsory service policy explained. They do charge a 12% service charge, which is clearly outlined in the menu. For a \"Pho\" place they also have wi-fi which we did not use.

I ordered a tripe Pho and Judy ordered a Pad Thai. The XL Pho is very large although I have seen larger. I was given a nicely flavored Pho, but it was Beef Tendon. When I mentioned this to the wait staff they brought me a plate of steamed trip almost immediately.  My wife's Pad Thai (one of her favorite dishes) was excellent. My soup was good, perhaps not the best Pho I have had, but good and clean food.

They do have a Groupon order form when you tell them that you are using a coupon and it makes things easy and simple. For dessert my wife had a chilled Vietnamese coffee which was excellent.

All in all a place to go back to occasionally. They did give us a coupon for $5.00 on our next visit."}
{"text":"Closed due to not paying their lease.

I wonder why, just look at all these bad yelp reviews.... ah well, pho is rarely done right if ever in Markham/Richmond Hill.  

Future businesses that wants to succeed in Vietnamese food? Do yourself a big favor and learn from an actual Vietnamese chef or HIRE A Vietnamese chef to make your restaurant's food! -_-;"}
{"text":"I went last night for dinner.  My BF and I wanted something light and simple, and pho fits the bill.  Only half of the restaurant was open, and the light of the other half was switched off.  Even so, the restaurant was not busy.  We ordered pho and dry noodle.  The dry noodle was refreshing enough, but it had not much meat.  The pho was full of MSG and had not much MSG.  If you consider that we paid $7.50 each (before tax), the food was very expensive.  Kim Bo serves better value.

I feel like adding that the service was fine.  The table was clean and not oily, etc..

I am not sure how long this business will be around, as there is a piece of paper on the window of the store, saying \"a food business\" store location is for leased."}
{"text":"I was here today only to find out it's been closed!

There is a letter posted on the door dated Sept 21, 2012.  Apparently they didn't pay their lease and the landlord has taken over.  The restaurant was dark and empty with 'For Lease' signs posted on the windows.

Hope it's replaced with something better as I found the location very convenient."}
{"text":"Agree with most of the bad reviews. I only have one word \"TERRIBLE\". I guess I finally found the worst pho in town."}
{"text":"Bad... pho is completely devoid of star anise.  A really really bad canto imitation of pho.  Closer to a clear beef broth soup.  Iced coffee was weaker than mcdonalds.  Like a quarter of the amount of ground coffee in a standard viet coffee.  At least they have wifi for me to write this review."}
{"text":"In the beginning, after reading the reviews regarding Pho on 7 I was a little reluctant on trying the food but figured I'd purchase the Groupon for it anyways and give it a try.

This is my third time going and I think this place is great--the food is not anything particularly outstanding, but it tasted delicious and there was a gorgeous atmosphere to boot.

I ordered #401 (do not remember the name...) but it contained a decent amount of meat (crab, beef, chicken, and pork) with a serving of rice and ordered the tomato pho as well (both  were served within five minutes of ordering). The tomato pho came smaller than I had anticipated, but for $8 I didn't expect the portions to be too grand (though the other dish was well worth it for $10). The broth was strong and suited my tastes perfectly (not too watered down), and the other dish was simply delicious (the pork, chicken and beef were tender with the right amount of flavor, whereas the crab was not too salty) .

The waiters were attentive, but not enough to feel invasive (they did serve us when we called for them and helped us with our orders by suggesting different dishes).

They DO have a service charge....and the taxes and tips already included within the bill--which can often leave the customer accidentally paying the tips twice.

Until my most recent visit I had not noticed that they had breakfast combos (8am-11am) where the food costs around $3-$5 with a drink included (it also may have side dishes included), as well as a tea time combo (3pm-6pm) where the food costs $5-$10 (drinks included) (though they pointed out that this was not valid for Groupon coupons...)

Overall, I don't think my experience is as bad as the other reviews. Pho on 7 isn't the absolute BEST place for pho (there's always better), nor is it the worst--it's pretty much just an average pho place (food tastes okay, service is average, though the atmosphere is nice and spacious).

I'd give it four stars--and will be going to try the breakfast combo tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Hello, I have just redeemed a Groupon voucher for a two-person meal at Pho on 7 this afternoon, and was extremely disappointed at this restaurant. 

Firstly, the service was poor. They did not bring us tea or water, even after I asked the server for tea after waiting for over five minutes. Since it didn't come, I had to ask the server a second time (after about halfway into the meal) before she finally brought us water. Next, I had asked for the dry noodle, which she acknowledged during order-taking but not did deliver. 

Secondly, the food was of very poor quality. The broth lacks flavour & tastes like hot water, the beef tasted like it had gone bad, & the appetizers we had were covered in thick batter which had been entirely sponged with grease. The rolls and salad were a different type of disaster as well. The only dish that was decent enough were the vermicelli with spring roll & meats. Although the spring roll was also not quite edible with its greasy & tough skin.

Needless to mention, though I will, was that we had not managed to finish any of our food despite going on an empty stomach, nor was I able to wrap up the leftovers as I felt uncomfortable after trying a bit from each dish.

Lastly, when the bill came, I found that I was charged $7. 77 for HST, and a 12% Service Charge of $6.85 (both rates was based on a subtotal of $57.09, and not the $25 Groupon price that I paid). The subtotal of the bill was only for the items included on this Groupon deal (they gave me a separate bill for the extra drink we ordered). and so I believe the tax amount charged was not very honest, as was the service charge since no where on the deal was I advised of a 12% service charge. On a separate piece of print-out from their calculator, they had noted an amount of $71.71 minus $60.97 equals $10.74 (which is the amount of tax & tips that I was to pay, which further confuse me as all the numbers do not add up). Nevertheless, I paid for those charges & for my separate bill amidst all this confusion, and we left as very unsatisfied customers."}
{"text":"An advice for Pho on 7... Having a Groupon deal won't boost your business if you handle the coupon and your customers the way you did!!

Since my voucher is for dinner for 2 and includes a lot of food.. I know I would not utilize the value. but my waitress insist that no matter how much food I order, I would need to pay taxes and tips on the Full amount.. but why am I paying taxes on something I didn't even order?

I lost my temper/cool and finally one of the waitress had everything sorted out.. and I back to ordering...

We ordered 

Mango Shrimp Salad ($7.97) - cold frozen cocktail shrimp? for $8?!!
Mango Salad ($6.97)
Vietnamese Rice Paper Roll ($4.27)
Satay Chicken skewers ($5.97)
Vietnamese Bean Curb ($5.27)
Large Pho ($7.97)
Vermicelli Combo ($7.97)
All tasted below average... Chinese version of Vietnamese food and a bad version...

Since we have some leftover credit on our Groupon, I was hoping to get some dessert.. They do have an interesting dessert menu but the waitress said they never have any of those ever, since no one ever really order them.... FAIL!

I won't be surprise to see Pho on 7 would be out of business soon if they don't improve on their quality of their food... and having Group Buy deals not going to help!!"}
{"text":"I came here because we were on our way back to the hotel. Exhausted and ready to turn in, we decided to just try a pho place since its across the street from the hotel. Hmm...maybe not the best idea. 

Our first red flag should have been that nobody was in the restaurant. We came in and sat down and I immediately noticed that this was not only a pho place, but that it also has Thai, Korean, and Chinese food...red flag #2!  As we waited to order, it turns out that you have to write your order on a piece of paper and turn it in to get served...red flag #3!!  Our pho bowls came out and the lady who served us said \"fo\"?  Oh man this must be authentic if these Asian ppl are mispronouncing the word pho! :( red flag #4!  Oh well...the pho was definitely not authentic but maybe Canada doesn't have good Vietnamese food?  My bun was alright, salty and sorta bland. The pho was made of Chinese noodles and the broth was not tasty at all. 

The service here was awful as well. Slow, not helpful and didn't really pay attention to us even thought we were like the only ppl in the place. The food did come out fast though.  Definitely will avoid while I'm here!"}
{"text":"Pleace is nice and clean. Food arrived quickly, just like most chineese restaurants. Yes, owers and staff are Chineese. Food quality and taste was ok (3 star quality). Menu is Thai and some Chineese with lots of items to choose from. You do have to get the waiters attention (good ol raising your hand trick works) to ask for something."}
