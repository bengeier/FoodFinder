{"text":"Great steaks, excellent service. A must have is the tomato and Onion salad."}
{"text":"Steaks were cooked perfectly.  Atmosphere is reminiscent of the old keg restaurants. Service is friendly and attentive.  The new york striploin had a good flavour with no gristle. Same with the ribeye.  The twice baked potato isn't that great. Get a regular baked potato or something else."}
{"text":"Wow!! Talk about love at first STEAK!! The steak here is absolutely Delicious!! Made perfect each time ! Service is great too :)  I will never go anywhere else for steak for as long as I live!!"}
{"text":"CattleBaron at 3340 26th St NE in Calgary is a large casual restaurant serving lunch and dinner. It's an indoor restaurant  with a bar and outdoor patio sections.  Nice presentations, not fancy, large portions, and good service.  Entrees range $20-30  My wife and I had dinner at the CattleBaron and enjoyed it. We had reservations and were seated immediately. Our service was prompt and friendly.  My wife ordered a chardonnay and I had a beer.  We split a Caesar salad.  My wife ordered an 8 oz end cut prime rib medium rare and I had the 8 oz prime rib medium rare.  Both entrees came exactly as ordered accompanied by fresh vegetables and potatoes.  My wife was impressed with the nice crust on the end cut but still medium rare on the inside.  Everything was delicious.    Nice presentations, and large portions. Service was very friendly and prompt. Our overall experience was very good. With wine,  beer, salad, tax and tip our dinner expense was $103."}
{"text":"This location works for the airport but by no means is this the spot to eat in Calgary.  If you need to eat near the airport and have an expense account go here.  We had a meeting here the other day and the food is just really A ok.  Many had the steaks and they were not premium cuts but they were cooked alright.  Don't go to Calgary for fresh seafood but the salmon here is cooked well, and not dry and over done.  Would you pay full price for a nice family out dinner, no.  Would you use your expense account to not eat at an \"XYZ\" chain, yes.  The staff are pleasant enough but they too are just doing their job."}
{"text":"If you have to meet someone in Calgary, especially near the airport, just say Cattle Baron.  Food is dependable and good, I enjoy the fun atmosphere, and there will be no huge surprises, which is good if you're with clients.  Prices were a bit high."}
{"text":"3 of us were away from home for thanksgiving and we went out in search of a turkey dinner and we ended up here ! It was Awesome turkey , stuffing gravy mash potatoes vegetables and it was cooked to perfection . The pumpkin cheesecake was incredible .... the service was exceptional !!! We are going to comeback and try their prime rib this week All 3 of us give it 2 thumbs up !!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to The Cattle Baron for our anniversary on February 6th and absolutely enjoyed the food. The staff was friendly and the food was really good. For dessert we had their cheesecake and was surprised with the words happy anniversary spelt out on the cheesecake, also we were not charged for the cheesecake! I would definitely recommend The Cattle Baron."}
{"text":"Classic old school steakhouse. Dark wood, mural of cowboys, basket of bread etc etc. My wife myself and our two elementary school age kids grabbed supper there based on yelp and we were staying at a hotel closeby. We ordered calamari, escargot, lamb lollypops and 2 steaks, the cowboy amd the filet. The lamb was exceptional. Escargot was pretty good. We disagreed on the calamari. I thought it was below average but both kids said it was the best they ever tasted. Steaks were excellant. Sides were excellant. Waite staff slightly above average."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Cattle Baron while in Calgary for the Stampede.  We dine out often, but had the pleasure of having one of the best servers we've encountered in a long time. The food was excellent.  The atmosphere was casual, family oriented, but yet enjoyable for adults dining out as well. Will definitely visit again, next time in Calgary."}
{"text":"I found this place by accident, while looking for another restaurant. The ribeye was perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. The staff, including the trainee, were very friendly, helpful, and prompt. I would highly recommend it and would have no problem taking customers here for dinner."}
{"text":"Tender steak and generous portions. The garlic mashed potatoes were delicious. I also got the tiger shrimp which were crispy and wonderful. The atmosphere was formal yet relaxed. It was summer, so there was no need for the giant outdoor fireplace, but I would like to go back when it is lit.  The waitress was very engaging and attentive"}
{"text":"The Cattle Baron has the best prime rib ever. The service is great and I couldn't ask for a better steakhouse! if only I lived in Calgary!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have had the thrill of traveling through North Dakota, Montana, and Alberta, Canada on a recent trip, and we have enjoyed excellent meals throughout our travels.  But we were completely unprepared for the truly outstanding dining experience that awaited us at The Cattlebaron.  True, we chose it because it was close to our hotel, but we'll be back for the food and the wait staff!  My wife had the filet mignon and I had the Manhattan steak ' shrimp combo meal.  We made numerous requests to our meal, including the preparation of our steaks.  Each request was taken without concern and the meals were superbly prepared.  The meat is, without question, the best steak you will ever eat--including those at Ruth's Chris. McCormick & Schmidt, and other renowned steak houses.  And don't let me forget to highlight the house salad, which was large, fresh, and accompanied by a nice stick of celery, carrot, and cucumber.  But the true surprise was the Brussel Sprouts and Bacon.  I love Brussel sprouts--my wife detests them--but we both thoroughly loved the Cattle Baron's version that even my wife ate her fair share of them.  Best of all, after all our compliments, the chef was willing to share his preparation secrets for this truly delectable dish.  And I would be remiss if I did not mention what a terrific waitress we had.  Noor was kind, friendly, and thoroughly engaging.  When I could not decide on which beer I might like more, she cheerfully brought me a sample to help make my choice.  She ensured our meal was exactly as we ordered, made helpful suggestions, and was a true pleasure.  Without question she is a tremendous asset to the Cattle Baron and easily the best waitress we have ever had!  My only compliant is that the Cattle Baron is located solely in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  We need you to open one in Northern Virigina, near Washington, DC, and send Noor there to train the wait staff!!!"}
{"text":"I am not sure what Queenie M was on when she went to The Cattlebaron Steakhouse because we just had a GREAT!!!! Meal there. The Wedge salad was one of the best I ever had! My wife had the prime rib and of coarse I had to try some, it was great! I had the ribeye and it was also GREAT! I have traveled a lot and this Resturant rates high on my list. Our waiter did a very good job, from making wine suggestions to meal suggestions, Great Job everyone at the Cattlebaron!"}
{"text":"Just went here for a quick meal but had had one of the best portion of prime rib that I've had in years. Perfectly cooked and full of flavour paired with excellent service made this evening perfect."}
{"text":"The Cattle Baron has perfectly prepared steak options. I ordered steak Neptune which had a fair amount of crabmeat on top of a petit filet with asparagus and hollandaise. The prices are fair, service was on the slower side but extremely friendly. They state they are child friendly but I found it extremely odd they will \"only verbalized the menu for kids but choose not to print it\". Being they are directly in front of a family friendly Sheraton it may be a good idea they consider capitalizing off of the demographics attracted to the local area."}
{"text":"I always looked around for a good steakhouse and Cattlebaron is up there on my list for sure! I'm all about quality and I've been to a few steakhouses that I found the quality was definitely not on par; this place, however, their quality of food is good! It is a bit expensive, but what food place isn't now-a-days in Calgary?"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great food. I would definitely recommend this place.  The hostess and my waitress were super nice. The atmosphere is warm and cozy. It felt very \"lodge-y\" if that makes any sense. Lots of dark wood and cushiony booths. I had the Prime Rib because I read many good yelp reviews about it. It was awesome. I got a baked potato as my side and she brought out this little caddy with the sour cream, chives, bacon bits, etc and dressed it to order. I found that to be a nice touch to the service. I ordered a martini and it was stiff and yummy. And the cheesecake was perfect."}
{"text":"Yes, a very nice find while in Calgary on business. Located in the airport hotel district it was just what I look for in a steakhouse. Dark, leather interior and a bit dated. We were quickly seated and drink orders taken, a bit limited on the draft beer selection, but hey, this is Calgary not Denver. I had a regular cut prime rib that was very tasty it came with a loaded backed potatoe. All in all a very pleasant meal."}
{"text":"No qualms whatsoever.  Yes the bright neon sign outside looks a little tacky but the inside of this restaurant is actually nicely decorated. It's interior is slightly on the upscale side, but it's not super ultra elegant.  During my visit service was top notch, helpful, friendly, and not overbearing.  My filet mignon tasted very good. It wasn't the best filet mignon I've ever had, but like I said it was very good. The sides (potatoes and onion rings) were very good as well.  Prices were kinda high. But that's just my opinion because I don't dine at many steakhouses. I guess steak ain't cheap so I gotta imagine all steakhouses are somewhat expensive. I suppose it goes with the territory of being a steakhouse.  Fo' sure, I'd return again for another visit."}
{"text":"Warm welcome, decent wine list, app was only warm not hot, bread doesn't freely flow like manna from heaven, meal was hot, veggies were generous in portion, steak and roast beef were plentiful, you will leave full and very satisfied."}
{"text":"AAA Silver 28days aged beef, this is not the kinda place you order chicken! Wedge Salad is a great way to start your dinner followed by MEAT anyway you like it. You get a choice of starch, and veggies. Some meals come with soup of the day or salad to start. Oh and the mocha dessert is decadent if you need a chocolate fix! If you're in the NE this place to go for your shot of Iron!"}
{"text":"Been to this steakhouse a number of times during my visits to Calgary. I've always had excellent service and food was fantastic. This last time though, service was ok, and food was not up to par...This was clear when it was picked up half eaten. I did comment to the waitress, however i guess it fell onto deaf ears. No apology and no effort to appease the customer. It was a disappointment...perhaps its new ownership; in any case i and my customers will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Okay, I must quickly type so that I can get back to my delicious steak dinner. Amazing. Literally going to lick the plate.  I could eat bowls of their whipped sour cream. The steak was a PERFECT medium rare. The potatoes amazing. The service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Food: 2.5/5 Service: 2.5/5 Ambiance: 2.5/5 Overall experience: 2.5/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  I'm going to save you the trouble and tell you to not come here for steak... or just about anything else. I had high expectations when they advertised AAA+ steak for $30+ but was really disappointed with the quality of the meat and preparation of the meals. Spend a little extra and go somewhere else!  I pictured Cattle Baron to be a classy steakhouse but the decor was outdated and drab. Our server could have been a little more enthusiastic about his job - he was stiff, straightforward, and \"distant\".   Our group ordered a few appetizers to share such as the 'Chili Chicken' ($12) tossed in a spicy sweet chili sauce with crispy wontons. It came out on a small plate and was like eating cheap deep fried chicken tenders. It was okay... but not worth the money. We also got the 'Escargot' ($10) which came in 6 pieces. It was tender but really bland. The best part however was dipping the complimentary bread in the garlic herb butter the escargot was baked in.   For the main course, you can choose from their charbroiled steaks that are under $40 for the largest size (Choice: sirloin, rib eye, NY strip loin, filet mignon); or their house specialties ($24-$30) including prime rib, lamb, fish, chicken, ribs, linguini. Each steak comes with sautéed vegetables (bell peppers, carrots, and broccoli); and your choice of baked potato, stuffed potato, or fries.   I ordered one of their combos, 'Pepper Shrimp Rib-Eye' ($36) which was a 10oz rib-eye steak with a handful of salt-n-pepper prawns. The shrimp was of decent size, lightly breaded, and tender. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, but the quality of the steak was dismal. The steak was thin (less than an inch) and the meat was tough and chewy.   I usually don't get dessert (~$10/ea) but I wanted to get a full overview of their menu. Based on the waiter's recommendation, we ordered their 'Apple Galette' which had a nice flaky puff pastry crust and wasn't overly sweet. The only missing part was a scoop of vanilla ice cream which was just whipped cream in this case.  After reading another review, I chose their 'Dark Chocolate Cake' layered with Bernard Callebaut mousse, fruit coulis, and whipped cream. I was a little stunned when it came out because the slice of cake was huge (perfect for sharing). The cake was dense and was missing a depth of chocolate flavor. There was also an odd minty aftertaste that was off putting ..."}
{"text":"Anyone could/would love it here, younger or older, it is just that kind of place. We went to kill some time before meeting a friend across the road at another pub and we were impressed. We stopped in thanks to all the high praising Yelp reviews I have read to date and well, we are not in the NE too often, so we took advantage. I cannot say this review is about the whole scale dining experience but I can comment on the fact that service is friendly, the decor is classy but not at all pretentious, clean as a whistle, drinks are amazing (beer temp and Caesars with the awesome homemade spicy rimmer salt and made as hot as I like em for a change!) and the escargot that was only $10 WITH complimentary homemade bread = a yummy steal! I am very excited that we found this place and will be looking into coming here for either X-mas eve or New Year's Eve!  We sat in the lounge and everyone's food coming out looked and smelled incredible.  The only teeny thing was that there was quite a bit of a wait for an initial waitress to come by and also how long it took the drinks to be prepared and come out but everything else, 5 out of 5. It was SO hard to be at a steakhouse and not get steak! Next time, promise!"}
{"text":"Went there on a friend's recommendation. Was disappointed. Ordered a prime rib which was a little undercooked and mostly fat. I feel like the cook tried to hide the pale greyish color of the meat by smothering it in sauce ...   Service was speedy and courteous."}
{"text":"5 stars for the service. 3.5 stars for the food and beer selection.  They didn't have any IPAs but the bartender was very friendly about it and gave me samples of a few of the beers on tap. I ordered the larger size prime rib with a few sides. The serving size here is definitely more than enough. The quality of the food is good but not good enough to warrant frequent trips back."}
{"text":"I have been to the cattlebaron many times and each time I go I am always impressed. Their food is delicious and is always up to par. They really have it down there because everytime you order something it always tastes the same. I have had the steak sandwich time and time again and it is always equally delicious. I always get it with a stuffed potato because they are soooo yummy. To be honest everytime I've gone there I have had the steak sandwich. Crazy right?? I had the calamari there and it was crispy and delicious. I could have had two orders over the course of an evening.   Anyways they always cook your steak to perfection; they haven't screwed up on mine once. And they use this seasoning, I don't know what it is but it is mouth watering. It doesn't take away from the steak itself at all which is great. The garlic bread is yummy as well however it doesn't stand up to the juices of the beef at all. I was a little dissapointed but it's just bread. The stuffed potato. I could eat that for dinner by itself. I always get it loaded. It's fluffy and light and always cooked to perfection. A perfect match for the steak sandwich.  The desserts here are awesome for those who have a sweet tooth. I usually had the Mud pie and it's always so yummy. It's not heavy and it's cool going down. I've also had the callebaut chocolate cake or whatever it is and boy is it rich. However if that's your thing I really reccomend it. They put a lot of effort into presentation.   The CattleBaron is always a treat and I'll never get tired of it,"}
{"text":"Best part about my experience here is my server Daniele she's amazing! Just the perfect service and she's cute as a button! The steak and appies I have nothing to complain about. The sauteed mushrooms was so sour I felt like I was eating a lemon, a definite no go for next time, but they were more then willing to address and resolve my issue  Now the rum here is the real deal... Let's just say I had one too many."}
{"text":"First of all service was good which isn't to uncommon for a stale house I suppose and the food came out fast which is also a blessing. However my prime rib was really unacceptable for a steak house quality meat. Even the sides were a let down really, you can't mess up a baked potato and so that was okay, the carrots and broccolini though were undercooked and in a weird sauce. Overall the bread was delicious so if you go enjoy the bread and hopefully the meal is better then mine."}
{"text":"In Calgary!  This is my first time in Canada.  After a long trip from San Antonio, I had a large appetite.   Fortunately, The Cattle Baron was a short walk away from the @sheratoncav .  The filet was great, cooked to a perfect medium.   Looking forward to checking them out again, their dessert & cocktail list is tempting but need to watch the waistline."}
{"text":"It's a busy Friday night here. Foods were just ok, salt & pepper prawns & calamari were pretty good, rack of lamb was just average, steak was good. Ambient was pretty nice, not too bad for a night out. This time was not as good as the south location."}
{"text":"I was here for a business lunch a month or so ago with a large group of about 10-12 people.  The waiting staff looked after us real well and the steaks were up to expectation for a steakhouse of this price range.  I must admit that this was my first time eating at this establishment but it certainly won't be my last."}
{"text":"Went before 6pm.  Very quiet and very efficient service.  Had the striploin.  Came prepared medium rare as ordered.  Very nice piece of steak.  Pretty good value and would visit again."}
{"text":"This is a nice resturant and the food is good.   However I was somewhat disappointed by a high end steak place on a couple of issues.    1) it is VERY load, odd for a place that would presume to be focused on business dinners and such.   2) and more important, while the steak was very tender, is wasn't particularly favorable. Not saying it was bad by any stretch, but for a $30 plus steak, I had higher expectations.   So for sure go, but for the proximity, is go to Ruth Chris."}
{"text":"I think I just found heaven.   If you enjoy good food then you must ask yourself WHY!!!! Why have tog never been here.  Yes the price will burn a hole in your pocket but the food puts you into a coma, so you forget about the price.  Mediterranean chicken was juicy, fresh, and tasted like bombs of flavorful chicken going off in my mouth.   Yum."}
{"text":"It may be already, but if it isn't, Alberta really should be known for it's steaks. The Cattlebaron is a fine establishment where you can enjoy the afore-aluded to steaks for a reasonable price.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  Having lived in Texas for the past 18 months, I can say with a seasoned nose and set of eyes that The Cattlebaron can give any Texan establishment a run for its money. The atmosphere is familiar yet uniquely Canadian, and fast and friendly service made the whole experience a good one. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  While I didn't take a picture, my meal was two-fold, with a portion of the soup of the day coming in at only $6 while my Rib Eye Steak Sandwich, also generously portioned, only $23.00. Fair. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  The soup? Marvelous, with a creamy garlic setting the right pace. From there, my rib eye steak sandwich was good, although not the best steak I've ever had. Cooked medium ended up being a bit overdone, and the seasoning was a bit light for my tastes. Good nonetheless. Single Star Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  The Cattlebaron is a fantastic atmosphere that serves up great dishes, but it wasn't the best of the best. No Star Granted."}
{"text":"When in Alberta, you gotta have the beef!   My medium rare Prime Rib was grilled perfectly especially when eaten with a bit of sinus-clearing horseradish.  The featured soup was a comfortingly sweet (but not too sweet) butternut squash soup with a slightly spicy sausage.  I'd definitely come back here next time I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"The free bread with whipped butter and the Strawberry Mocktail are delicious! Love the cabin like look of the outside and the seating outside is very cozy."}
{"text":"We were passing through Calgary a couple weeks ago and staying at the Sheraton Cavalier Calgary Hotel.  We were tired and did not want to travel far so walked across the street to The Cattlebaron.  Wow, we were pleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere, the wait staff, and the food (and portions) for the price, were excellent.  We dined on a Monday night."}
{"text":"This is an unassuming casual steakhouse and bar; a friend and I visited on January 23rd and had the pleasure of being served by a very personable (and entirely non-robotic) server named John. He was exceptional!  We ordered the cheesy garlic toast to start, and were a bit baffled by the taste for a bit, until we realized it was powdered parmesan cheese. The rest of the dishes were solid (I had a prime rib, and my friend had a sirloin), though the stuffed potatoes were a bit dry, saved by the generous helpings of sour cream, chives, and bacon.  We considered dessert, but were too full to continue. A casual, go-to place with exceptional service and solid, though not exceptional, food."}
{"text":"We had terrific last dinner of our honeymoon at the airport location.  We had just driven in from Banff after having a not-so-good experience at a chain steakhouse a few nights prior - and really wanted to leave Alberta with the taste of good steak in our mouths.  We are so glad that we picked Cattle Barons!  The service was fantastic, the food phenomenal, the steaks had amazing flavor, the prices extremely reasonable.  We WILL come back next time we are in calgary and we definitely recommend!  Cattlebaron's helped us end our Alberta visit on a high note!"}
{"text":"Had a nice meal at the Cattlebaron last night.  Restaurant was a bit warm but we were a large group and the restaurant was packed so this was probably the reason.  Ordered the Seafood platter which was delish!  For an entree I had the Steak Neptune which was really good as well!  A definitely good selection if you are in Calgary and want your fix of Alberta beef!"}
{"text":"From the area you might not think this would be as great a steakhouse as it is. Inside the decor is nice. We got a table right away. The dining room gets  loud and was hard to hear my coworker talking across the table but not a deal breaker. Our server was friendly and funny and not pushy. I had the 10 oz prime rib and garlic mash. The prime rib was bigger than i pictured so i was glad i got the smaller cut. My coworker got a baked potato and when our waiter came with the fixins he asked if i also wanted bacon, sour cream, and chives for my mashed potatoes. Hell yes i do! The beer list had a good variety with both big brands with a few craft brands also. Good wine selection too. Over all great experience."}
{"text":"Went there with some work folks. Nothing fancy but the food was great. My \"double\" Manhattan came in the smallest of low balls but everything else was as expected. The tuna was tasty."}
{"text":"Another Calgary tradition. Beautiful prime rib. And always remember to order gravy on the side or not at all. (Gravy is a very Canadian thing.) the only thing I like on my prime rib is a dollop of their wonderful, very tasty horse radish. Top notch with a kick. YuM. Staff is exceptional and very attentive. See you next year."}
{"text":"We had our family dinner here which is quite a large group. We all ordered our own dishes and some really enjoyed their meals while others less so.  The favourites of the night are the steaks, prime rib, and stuffed potato.  The fish, chicken and ribs were okay.  The prices are very reasonable for the food.  The atmosphere is definitely less stuffy than Wellingtons.  Not first on my list but there is a good variety on the menu so there's something for everyone especially with a big group."}
{"text":"We were in Calgary on our way to visit the national parks and upon picking up our rental car next door, we spotted this restaurant.  The bf wanted STEAK for dinner after our long day of travel and we decided to check this place out....  The restaurant was NOT busy on a Saturday evening, we got seated right away and I got to check in using their Free Wifi (ask your server for the password :)).  We both were hungry! so we each ordered the Prime Rib, baron cut (bigger ha!). I got mine with garlic mashed potatoes while the Bf got baked potatoes.   The (free) bread came out fresh and warm, a great start to our meal.  Our plate of BIG cut Prime Rib came fairly quickly and our eyes were twinkling ready to ATTACK that great looking piece of beef! o yeah!!!  I only wish that they would have given more of the au jus sauce..we were too tired to ask but the prime rib was still super duper delicious!!! I licked my plate clean!!! literally!!!   The server was friendly but attentiveness was just so so...he came to refill our drink once and we don't see him on the floor much other than when we flagged him for our bill..  But as far as how the beef taste... yummmmmmmmmm!!!!! delcious!! and I won't complain for the $30 price tag on my big cut of prime rib! Afterall, it's a nice restaurant so $30 for the type of restaurant is actually on the cheap side..in my opinion..  I'll probably try their steak next time.. (not sure when that is!! hahaaha)"}
{"text":"My first experience with cattle baron was when I started with a new company and my boss took me out for lunch. I can't remember exactly what I had but I know it was a steak...in fact the best steak I had ever eaten. It was one of those steaks that make you want to eat slower just so you can savour every bite.  Since that first time there, it became the place to go if I wanted a steak. My fiance and I went there and not being the steak fan I am, she ordered a chicken pasta dish which she loved but she wanted a bite of my steak when the food came out. After 1 bite, she agreed that she should of ordered one too.  The restaurant has a great atmosphere as well. it isn't a noisy place and you cna always relax while you eat. The waiters are fantastc too. I felt like I had my own private waiter who was there as soon as you set down your empty drink. Overall, I really do love the cattle baron and wish there were alot more place like it."}
{"text":"I ordered the 10oz sirloin, cooked medium well. The steak was perfect, juicy and flavorful. Just doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch. First time at this restaurant and wasn't disappointed. My wife can't eat dairy or gluten and they were very accommodating. She had sirloin steak and said it was best she ever had. I had a burger and it was equally good. Great service too. Will return."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Great food, atmosphere and our waitress, Cindy was perfect! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The keg ripoff...everything is similarly priced or same price. Feature deals is like their classics. Took forever for food to come and server had smokers breath."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic dinner with my business associate and his wife! Tremendous service by Taylor who made our evening amazing. Calgary's beef was well represented by the cuts and the amazing cook's talent."}
{"text":"There are some pretty mixed reviews about Cattle Baron, but I paid it my first visit last night and don't have a single complaint.  I've only ever heard good things about it.  The restaurant has an open, casual atmosphere and you can dress up or down, really.  There were some kids but very few and old enough that they weren't screaming and disrupting our life.  My party of three ended up chatting and laughing with a few patrons seated beside us and they were just as friendly as our server, who was very much on-the-ball despite the fact that the place was full.    Our food and drinks arrived in a very timely fashion and everything was hot.  I was the only one who didn't order steak.  Apparently both cuts at the table were excellent.  I had the Jambalaya with rice and when the dish arrived, it blew my mind.  It was the largest, heartiest serving I've ever had in Calgary.  Wow.  I didn't even manage to eat half.  It was very spicy and a bit shocking at first.  However, once I acclimatized, I really enjoyed it.  For those who actually care about this, you'll be happy to know that the spices didn't traumatize my body the next day so I'd encourage you to give this plate a shot.  I'd order it again and the price was right.  I truly paid for three meals for myself.    And Kudos for a clean and well-lit ladies room.    Unfortunately, I don't travel this far south in Calgary very often, but I'd like to return for more meals and sit in the lounge next time."}
{"text":"3 stars pretty much sums this place up: it's... ok.  What's a Vancouverite to do in Calgary? Eat steak. Obviously. So in the quest to eat ALL of the beef, the family and I turned to Yelp mobile (or as my mother calls it: \"the searchy thing\") to seek out the best of the best.  This was not it.  Don't get me wrong - this place is ok. It's spotless and cozy in a completely regular sort of way and by regular, I mean i'm pretty sure there's a factory somewhere, pumping out paint by numbers steak houses:  Take large room; add dim lighting; dark wall paper; touch of leather; wood accents; a large, oddly placed mirror and a western mural. Fill with 20 something servers in all black. Repeat. It's sort of like dining at a western themed Cactus Club... which, i'll admit, has it pros and cons.  Pros:  The steak here is good. Order the rib eye. It's tasty.  The service is also pretty paint by number, but guess what? That means it's pretty damn good, if not a little boring. You will get your wine glass filled in a timely manner, have the right cutlery and they won't auction off your food at the table. Plus one for seat numbers!  They carry Liberty School Cab. Tip of the hat!  Cons: It's completely boring.  Nothing about our dinner stood out enough to make this place shine. In fact, all our sides were pretty lackluster (the stuffed potato sounds like a good idea, but it's very very dry).  And this is a personal pet peeve of mine, but if i'm shelling out $35 dollars for a steak entree... not to mention for a decent bottle of wine and potentially dessert: you better have a nice bathroom. Nothing kills a restaurant quite like walking into a bathroom and having it be the equivalent of a mall food court. If your customers are paying over $75 a head: please put proper doors and handles on your stalls.  So all in all... this is ok. I wouldn't make a point to go back, but if I lived in the area, i'd likely pop into the lounge (which has a bit more character) for a drink and a steak sandwich every once and awhile."}
{"text":"I work around the corner and we come here a lot! I really like the food at this restaurant. And the service is usually top notch as well!   They aren't usually very busy at lunch time unless its close to christmas. then there are lots of christmas parties.   Steaks are always cooked perfectly and i find the vegetable that you get on the side are absolutely delicious! A nice change from veggies that taste like nothing."}
{"text":"We went for a romantic meal tonight and were disappointed by the noise and my dinner.  The server was very good, my husband's meal was to his satisfaction, the chilli chicken appetizer was delicious, but I ordered the 7 oz steak sandwich, and it was pretty much inedible.  These pictures shows how much of that 7 oz was fat and gristle (I got it to go for my dogs).  The floor manager (?) - a woman - came by and asked how everything was and when I pointed to this, she explained that that's what all steak sandwich cuts look like and the chefs always made it a larger cut because of that.  As you can see from the scale, that's 2.4 oz of meat.  You think they cut my steak 2.4 oz larger, just in case?  Nope.  I'm not saying don't go there, but I am sure never going to have that rip off steak sandwich again!    Well, I don't know how to post a photo here, but if I can, I will."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was good. The atmosphere was very family style and casual. The prices were similar to the keg but a more casual setting. I probably would pick the keg if I'm paying for similar food but better atmosphere."}
{"text":"First, this is not a 4 star, but a 4.5 star to me.  Absolutely awesome place.  I've been here a few times, and all I can say is that the Prime Rib is absolutely awesome.  In fact, I believe that the only Prime Rib I've had in Calgary that is better would be the one offered by Vintage Steakhouse, and on the same as Smuggler's Inn.    What differentiates this place is the quality of the side dishes, the ambiance and the service.  Dim lighting, but classic decor. Music is subdued, and it's comfortable.  The baked potato add ons are freakin' awesome, and the garlic toast is noteworthy.  Either way, expect a wonderful meal each and every time!  Oh, one last note, I keep hearing great things about the lobster and seafood.  Gotta go soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have returned to this restaurant each year during our visit to Alberta for some fantastic fly fishing.  This year we were served by Chris who was very attentive and efficient.  Although I am a beef person I seem to always \"land\" on the seafood linguini.    The amount of seafood varied as follows: calamari = plenty and VERY tender, shrimp = good portions and VERY-VERY tender, scallops = adequate portion and VERY tender,  clams = small and hard to find, but tender.  We took a $40 cab ride to get there from our hotel so we must have thought it was worth it."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by our hotel so we went out with our three children for supper after a long day at the zoo.  We were looking for something different but good quality.    First off the kids meals were ok and the ones we ordered for them cost $7 (which is what most restaurants these days charge for kids meals) but then my one daughter wanted apple juice which drinks were not included with the meals (which seems silly but I figured it's a small apple juice so what's the worst it will cost) $4!!! For a tiny little apple juice!!! Our meals were steak which weren't terrible but definitely didn't blow us away by any means.  I had the top sirloin with a stuffed potato, which came with veggies on the side and I ordered bearnaise sauce on the side as well. The steak was ok, definitely nothing to rave about (for the cost of $25 I might as well have went to the keg because theirs is way better).  The veggies were bland and tasted unseasoned. I had to load them with some salt just to get any flavour at all.  I love bearnaise sauce with steak but for an extra $5 it was disgusting (it had the weirdest taste).  The stuffed potato could have definitely been executed better.  It was pretty much just potato scooped out of the skin, rebaked and then the server comes out and plops on sour cream, chives and bacon bits for you.    My husband got the Ribeye steak sandwich with the stuffed potato.  And that is all it came with literally.  The server told us everything under that side of the menu got choice of potato and a side of veggies.  His came with a slice of tomato and a cucumber ..for $25?!    All in all, it's definitely not horrible.  But for the quality and the price you're better off just sticking to the keg."}
{"text":"My brother was in town and he was interested in trying out the AAA beef that everyone talks about in Alberta. I was also curious to see what all the fuss was about. I did a quick search on Yelp decided that Cattlebaron was a good choice.  I was happy to see that all their beef is grade AAA+. I don't even know what that means, but it sounds top notch. It also stated that it was aged 28 days. I'm guessing that's supposed to be a good thing?  I had my eyes set on steak. I decided to get the rib-eye cut, but if I could do it over again, I would've got the filet mignon.  I ordered it medium-rare of course. Now I'm not much of a steak person so it's hard for me to judge. I just decide if I was blown away by taste and I definitely wasn't. Just tasted like regular old steak to me. I really wouldn't have been able to tell if it was grade AAA+ if someone just gave me any regular steak from the grocery store.  It didn't taste horrible, and the service wasn't bad either. I just feel I had my expectations set really high and it didn't meet my expectations. I didn't think it was good value for what it was. I probably wouldn't go back.  Nothing against the restaurant here. This is just my opinion and I'm probably not the best judge of steak anyways."}
