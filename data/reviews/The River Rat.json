{"text":"My husband and I have been hesitant to visit since the last change of ownership. We were pleasantly surprised!! Michelle, our server, was personable and attentive. She made sure everything was to our liking and checked on us often. The food was incredible. The homemade soup was a chicken vegetable with rice. I could have easily eaten a whole pot of just the soup instead of a small cupful. 
The entrees (chicken parmigiana for me, Alfredo fettuccine for my husband) were excellent. The serving size was incredible. We have lunch for tomorrow. We will definitely be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice now since reopen.  I've been told by several people that they did not enjoy it at all and to not bother going.  However, I ignored them and went anyways.  Both times I have been it has been AMAZING overall. I will be going back regularly due to the fantastic service and the convenient location.  Food is good for the price as well - very large portions.   Nate was our server tonight - fantastic job, very attentive!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went in to try River rat heard it went through some renovations we both ordered burgers burgers came out cooked properly I had the mountain the Crowders Mountain burger it was huge. No alcohol just ice tea it was good service was good waitress was good. Restaurant was clean bathrooms were clean we will definitely go back"}
{"text":"We had the 10 oz ribeye, twice baked potatoe, and steamed vegetables. We had been wanting to dine here for quite some time and decided to visit on our anniversary. Unfortunately, this was the worst meal I can remember dining out ever!  Ribeye had little taste (raw) and appeared to have been cooked on a cold grill, steamed vegetables were hard, and I am not sure what happened to the potatoe?

The only positive to this dining experience was the wait staff who were very attentive during our visit."}
{"text":"A little unorganized. But it's barely been open a week so we can excuse that. Food and service was good. 

Spinach dip appetizer was an amazing delight to the taste buds! The pita points needed to be a bit crispier. It was a little hard to scoop up that great cheese!!

Our server Kristy was helpful, polite, and on point. She was interested in everything we had to say and asked our opinions too. 

Even tho we waited forever for our table the appetizer came in 3 mins. Meals were at the table in 10 mins. 

The fresh baked rolls were delish and came with REAL butter. Nice touch. 
I ordered the 10 oz ribeye. Came with two sides. 18$. Steak was a tad more rare than I wanted but was ok. Baked potato was cooked perfectly. I wanted to try the Mac and cheese. It was not over cooked. A big plus. Needed some salt. It's made with a variety of cheese. None of them yellow. Lol. Nice change. Overall food was good, steak was not anything to rave about. That being said. If they could come up with a signature garlic butter- I'd come back every week!! Lol

My daughter ordered the angry bull burger. It is an angus beef patty with BBQ pulled pork mixed in!! Sounds strange but she LOVED it!! Cooked the way she wanted it- med well and still juicy! Had BBQ sauce on it- slightly sweet. Bacon and she added cheddar cheese. Wooo wee was it good!! She got the fries. Cooked nicely crispy on the outside soft and tender on the inside. 

After all if that. I can't say enough about that spinach dip. We will come again JUST FOR THAT!

Oh and. They are packed!! So we suggest you make a reservation!!!"}
{"text":"Our server was polite and efficient and the manager, who came to apologize about the horrid, non-eaten dinners, was polite and personable. On the plus side the server sent him over without being asked and he did comp the 2 horrid dinners
 A party of 6...2 thought their dinner was just OK , 2 thought not worth it and 2 thought the worse they had ever had.
Chances of returning are less than extremely slim."}
{"text":"Food pretty good. Service, not so much. They could be another busy Lake Wylie restaurant parking lot if they get that figured out. When we were finally greeted at our table (slow night too) everything that could have gone wrong did. Waitress kept blaming her obvious mistakes on the kitchen quite unfairly. I'd try it again but they really need to focus on service quality as Lake Wylie is craving good restaurants."}
{"text":"Another sad attempt at a decent restaurant in Lake Wylie.  Can't say much more then that. Maybe the fourth try  will be the charm."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue.  They say you shouldn't judge a book by its cover and for good reason.  I was snobby when I looked up their menu online one evening and made an assumption based in the online menu that the food wouldn't be good.  My husband who works locally commented that every day, more cars are in the parking lot so something good must be served or they wouldn't be busier.  I relented and we went for dinner.  We've been back three times since! This restaurant, by far, is a great restaurant.  We had the pleasure of having a young man named Daniel serve us and although maybe green in the fine dining arena, he quickly caught on. Each time we returned, we requested him as our server and he remembered our names. 

We have sampled their steaks and their prime rib among other entrees and nothing negative to report.  The food is served at a nice pace so you aren't rushed. The food is cooked to order, good servings, and properly prepared.  And their tiramisu is to die for! A good wine selection, fair prices, good ambiance, lower noise level, and great food is what Lake Wylie needed and I stand corrected to not judge a book by its cover.  I look forward to menu specialities as the restaurants popularity grows and the seasons change.  Maybe they had issues when they reopened and it was slow going but I recommend a revisit if you had a problem.  They have great customer service and I can say that when I want a tasty steak or prime rib, they are worth the visit! No need to head to Charlotte.  There is a diamond right here in town!"}
{"text":"We are fans of the original River Rat so we had to give this a try.  On the plus side, the food was very good. Unfortunately, the bad outweighed the good.  When we entered, the bar/reception area looked like the old River Rat. However, when we were led back to our table, that's where the similarities ended.  The dining areas are still divided into smaller dining rooms.  Where before these areas were cozy and warm, they are now cold and cheap looking.  They are filled with cheap tables and stackable chairs.  It was a fish camp atmosphere.  We had a difficult time hearing each other at our table for two because the noise level of the other diners was too loud. Then there was the service.  We put in our drink orders and 10 minutes later our server came by and said she was going to get our drinks.  Another 10 minutes passed before she finally came back with the drinks.  We put in our food order and then the waiting began.  Three other tables that were seated after us, received their food and were close to finishing their meals before we received our dinners.  Our server blamed it on the kitchen and the manager blamed it on the server.  For the money we spent, we could have had as good a meal, with better service, in a much better atmosphere at a number of other restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Fantastic service at The River Rat. We came in for the first time tonight after a long day of driving. One of the owners greeted us at the door and walked us to our table. Our waitress was Maggie, she's fantastic. The food tasted amazing and is all made from scratch. Family owned restaurant.  Casual feel, good family atmosphere."}
{"text":"It saddens me that this restaurant seems to be unable to be what it could be.   I was excited to try it after it opened again. But was my last time to visit other than if I wanted to have a drink and just chill for a bit. This place needs some creativity. ..supported by some higher standard of food quality and service.   I love this building and I would love to see the owners win. ..maybe get a consultant in to offer some suggestions. ..a menu that they could really be good at with a signature plate or items perhaps,  servers who are trained well and who love what they do. ..all this is needed to get it to be what it can be. This is meant to be constructive. ..I hope it's perceived that way.   I love this building,  it's location. ..some updating for sure,  but a great potential."}
{"text":"Don't come here hungry. I couldn't tell you if the food is good. We have been here an hour and 45 minutes and haven't seen an entree. Service has been horrible, over priced for such poor service, I had to get my own refills on 2 drinks.  Waitress was over sat and over worked. This is a management issue not a server issue. Our server was in tears.  They seated us in a quiet cubby and basically forgot about us.  Salad had Saran Wrap in it. Still waiting for our steaks. Brought out wrong drinks and did nothing about it. We ordered black berry Long Island - got some weird yellow drink called a Long Island but still wrong.  Manager did nothing but offer an apology. Really? That's just poor poor customer service ....! 

Don't waste your time! 
If you come here that's what you will be doing. 
And paying premium for it.

We asked for a manager he said sorry. 
At the 2 hour mark with no entrees we told the manager we were leaving and we left."}
{"text":"The service was not the best. As a server myself, I understand that we all have off days and that as customers, you never really know what's going on behind the scenes. That being said, we waited at least ten minutes before we were ever greeted, and waited ten more minutes for our server to bring us waters and bread. Luckily we had enough time before she came back to figure out our orders so that was relatively painless and our food did come out fast. She never asked if we would like any other drinks besides water but my father ordered a diet Pepsi that only came after he reminded our server. 

The food wasn't amazing. I ordered the stuffed flounder and it had no flavor whatsoever. My stepmother ordered the fettucine alfredo that was saved by the addition of shrimp. My father ordered the grilled salmon which he deemed \"not bad\". 

Our server was double-sat when we were wrapping up and it seemed like both tables had to wait for service as wellthe second table moved and their excuse was the speaker nearby but they seemed upset to be waiting. Before we ever paid, she took my (long empty) water glass and put my knife and fork inside so I couldn't even ask for a refill. 

For pros: my dad liked the music and my stepmom liked the bread. 

Overall, not planning on returning. It wasn't upsettingly bad, just kind of depressingly not good."}
{"text":"First time here since I'm recently new to the area and I have to say it was ok. For appetizer I got the clams casino which was not what I expected it just had peppers and onions on it and I didn't even see bacon so that I won't get again, I also had the bisque soup and man it was like I was having more salt then soup extremely salty so that I won't get again and last but not least I got the ribeye it was so small and thin not even sure if it was a ribeye lol it was tasty but definitely on the chewy side. My husband got the Philly cheese steak sandwich and he loved it, I would try this place one more time since I always believe in 2nd chances and maybe go just for the bar and get a sandwich so stay tuned for review #2 when we decide to go again. I have to say the staff was very nice and our server was awesome just wish the food was just as awesome as the service was!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I have ever experienced. Should have known when we pulled up and noticed that the property had not been well maintained that the wait staff/food would be equally unappealing. First and last time going to this place."}
{"text":"Gross is all I have to say. Sat down. Waited 20 min to order drinks. Looked at the menu and what other people were eating and the interior /decor. It was horrible. Before the drinks came we left. Glad we didn't stay."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat on a Friday evening can be challenging especially around 6p. This was our second choice due to the other being uber crowded and we have not been here.  

Decent size place and bar area.  No real theme though. We asked for for a beer menu.  When the bartender said, \"Give me a minute to look for one\" we knew we were in trouble.  After she brought the menu, I promptly took a look at the taps. We ordered two on tap mostly for quality as bottles were the standards: Bud Light, Heineken, Coors - need I go on?! 

We decided to order food. We ordered another round and asked for a couple of minutes to decide on food. We wait, wait, wait, wait, wait and wait...... 25 minutes no one returned to take our order.  That is money left on the table.  We decided not to order food.  

Overall, it took way too long to reorder drinks, food: enough said.

This location is not bad.  This place has potential but needs someone to push it forward.  

Craft beer on draft 3, food variety 4, location 5, prices 4, service 1.5."}
{"text":"I had low expectations and was pleasantly surprised... everything the table (of 6) got was delicious. The kids meals were generous for my 4 & 9 year old and the quality (again) was much better than expected. The only reason it's not a 5 is because the décor was nothing special but other than that I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food is Amazing this is going to be my new favorite place and date night with my fiancee.  My steak was cooked to perfection with my scallops blacken on the side, they just melted in my mouth.  My salad was fresh and crisp with every bite, and the mushroom risotto truly gives a meaning to culture I felt like the chef is Ramsey from hells kitchen... perfect and finished off with perfection with a youch of wiley tea from the bar finishes off your taste buds to complete your meal. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and so was the staff 
The restaurant is a little outdated and is in need of a remodel ,but all in all a good experience."}
{"text":"We've had excellent fish and Italian dinners here. Recently we had eggplant parm and chicken parm. Both were outstanding!  We were pleasantly surprised since you don't really think 'Italian' when you go to 'River Rat'.. but it was seriously good and reasonably priced. We each had enough leftover for a good lunch portion. Service was excellent and the staff super friendly. The interior (2 right back dining areas) could use some updating.. maybe some paint and softer lighting, some cool nautical decor on the walls.. the bar area is cool and they have a huge space for dinner events.. would make a great corporate dinner spot or rehearsal dinner. Overall, recommend for a great seafood or Italian experience."}
{"text":"Great service! Very attentive! Wonderful pizza! They ran out of the wine we were drinking and upgraded us for the same price. Will definitely be going back to the River Rat!"}
{"text":"Second visit ,  i had lassagna  was very taste loved the homade  sauce . My wife had the chicken parm 2 large peices of chicken breast. No way she could finish it all 
Excelnt service  will deff go back for Italian food ."}
{"text":"At first service was a tad slow, but picked up dramatically.  Food and beverages were excellent, atmosphere casual and we found a friendly staff.  Reasonable crowd for a Tuesday evening.  Yes, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is my first and last time to the River Rat EVER!!!  It's Saturday, October 10, 2015 at 10pm and the food and service we received tonight is unacceptable! Everything started with a 6.30pm RSVP that we showed up 5min early for.  To make a long story short appetizers took 30 minutes (they gave my bruschetta to another table and took another 15 minutes to remake) salads took another 15 minutes after appetizers ... everyone got a salad but my fiancé!
We let the server know another 10-15 minutes later when she finally came back. The server leaves and literary a second later all of our food comes out. We still had soup coming and the food was at the table.  We asked that the food be taken back and the server tells us and I quote \"I don't want to take the food back because it will sit under the HEAT LAMPS!\"  I immediately asked for the manager...5 minutes later a food stained cook comes out of the kitchen, greets our table, and says and I quote \"I hear there's a problem here what's going on?\"  I explained to him what happened and the cook/manager said and I quote \"I'll keep it warm under the HEAT LAMPS!!!\"  Un-Flipping believable \"I informed him to take the food back, let us eat our salads, go get our soup course, and re-cook our food so everything was fresh!
Wouldn't you expect \"all\" the food you ordered in the \"correct order\" you ordered it in, in a timely manner?  
We finally get our food by like 7:50 I cut into my Cajun Medium/Rare steak look at it and take a bite.  I knew immediately the food wasn't fresh.  1st my steak had NO Cajon seasoning on it, 2nd a mid-Rare steak has a warm red center and my steak was pink on one side and well/done on the other!!!  Proving the cook/manager had no clue of what he was doing and just sat our food back under a heat lamp because he didn't want to re-cook it!!! The other 3 meals were lukewarm.  Cook-said-manager comes back out and lies to my face again about re-cooking our food so that it was all fresh and not food that sat under a heat lamp for 30 minutes.  None of us could even eat our food because it wasn't cooked right and it wasn't even warm. By far the worst dining experience I've ever had in my life.
Sunday Morning - October 11, 2015.....
So I decided to get a good night's rest and review what I wrote last night (something I've never done before)...you know to read through everything with a clear head.  I want to add that it has been years since I was treated so poorly by a manager. He still forced us to pay for 2 of the 4 inedible meals... almost $100 for drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 inedible meals, a worthless server, and a so-called cook/manager lying to my face and fighting with us in front of other customers!  Totally embarrassing and demeaning to myself and my family and a complete waste of money!
Monday Afternoon - October 12, 2015.....
I called back to the restaurant and spoke with the front of house manager (who was not there Saturday night).  I re-explained everything that happened Saturday night to her.  The manager apologized about what happened and told me that the food stained cook that was fighting with me in front of other dinners Saturday night was in fact not only the manager, not only the head cook, but he was also one of three owners.  The front of house manager was very nice and understanding, but never offered to refund us for the horrible experience.  I had asked the front of house manager to talk to the other two owners and have them call me.  She said that they own other restaurants and wouldn't be in until Thursday (10-15-15), but she would personally make sure they got my complaint and would have them call me to fix everything.
Monday Morning - October 26, 2015.....
Two weeks later I still haven't heard from anyone from The River Rat Restaurant forcing me to dispute the charges on my credit card, and file a complaint with the South Carolina State Attorney Generals office!!!  I would not want my worst enemy to go through what I have experienced at The River Rat Restaurant, and I will NEVER be back!!!!
December 4, 2015....UPDATE
I have an open case with consumer protection. Several letters were sent to the restaurant, from consumer protection, and all of them were returned. 10 days ago I drove back to the River Rat took pictures of the address on the front of the building and sent them along with copies of their business card off to consumer protection. While I was there that day I went inside and let the bartender photocopy my receipt from the night in question along with the letter I received from consumer protection, and left my cell number. My case worker emailed the official complaint to the email address on the business card. Again that was 10 days ago and still nothing....kinda at a loss for words at this point! It saddens me that anyone in the business of serving the public would act in such a way!"}
{"text":"Well I would call this place decent enough, don't expect amazing because that's not really the market of the area the bar restaurant is placed in. When you walk in its got a ocean, fishing type theme. Food is average for what could be called local hole in the wall. Big bar arcade machine and a lobster tank. Big place wasn't close to fill at lunch time but cheesesteak was decent onion rings ok. The area is in desperate needs for more bars so options are limited"}
{"text":"Went here for a early morning burger to kill the hangover. Worst service ever. Slow with drinks, over an hour for a burger and fries. Horrible atmosphere. Will never walk in here again"}
{"text":"My first time here. There were only 3 cars in the parking lot. I was promptly greeted and taken care of. Huge live lobsters in a tank. The air filter on the tank is loud and almost put me to sleep lol

The interior is older than I expected. My server was very nice. I ordered Mountain Dew and spinach dip with fried pita chips. It came out hot looking yummy. 

Unfortunately, I didn't care for the dip. It's apparently made with Alfredo sauce, so it was like eating a bowl of Alfredo with spinach. There was about 2 tablespoons of oil floating on the sides :/

Don't get me wrong I like Alfredo, but not when I'm expecting spinach dip. I most likely will not go back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Lake Wylie.  All of my meals are excellent.  The bartenders are wonderful (especially Heather) and they make really cool and fun new drinks."}
{"text":"In short, this place has tons of potential, but falls short.  I love the location on Lake Wylie. They have ample parking and ample seating.  

The bar is my favorite area to venture, so when we arrived just after 6PM on a Friday that's where we headed.  Lots of seating, so no challenges there. We asked for a drinks menu and that was apparently an odd request.  It took the bartender a bit to locate one.  In the mean time we walked over and made a drink selection of the craft beer by sight.  Not a bad selection and the lines were obviously clean because the beer tasted perfect. 

We had planned to order food, but it took forever for us to get a menu and even longer for them to ask if we wanted something.  As the time ticked by I eventually lost interest and decided to order a final beer along with my check to close out.  

I liked what was on the menu, but I don't like to wait.  I don't even have a challenge with togo orders, but I hate to think how long I'd have waited for that.  

Ultimately there was a lot of money this place left on the table.  I'd have ordered more if there was prompt attention.  Might come back for a drink. I love clean beer lines and properly cleaned glasses. 5 Stars for that.

Location 4, Beer selection 4, Service 2, Food Options 4,  Price 3, look and feel inside 2. Solid 2.5. I'll round to 3 overall."}
{"text":"Food was good but not great.  Wife ordered the French Onion soup and was not thrilled with it.  Over all not a bad place to eat.  Staff was very friendly.  Plan on trying it again with the kids since they eat FREE."}
{"text":"Just okay.  Calamari was delicious. Drinks were watered down.  Green been casserole was scary looking, but tasted okay. Potato cold. Bread wonderful. Service hit or miss. Food came timely but never refilled water glasses. Deco was a joke. Don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Crab cakes were decent.... the French Onion soup was terrible and lacked flavor...  overall tonight's meal was a waste of money..... disappointed tonight"}
{"text":"Figure I try this place out since I live close by.  Disappointed with the food, but mostly with the staff. One of the waitress was very obnoxious, yelling across the restaurant laughing and talking to the other staffs. To top it off, she was walking around singing loudly. Maybe she was practicing to go on American idol! Would not recommend this place or go back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and ordered the Calamari,  This was the best Calamari I have ever had.  This was not frozen seafood.  This was the real stuff, it was fresh, and you notice the difference immediately.  I can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I had the Mediterranean Salad and my wife enjoyed the Mahi Mahi; great food and service! Glad to see someone took this gem of a restaurant and has had success!"}
{"text":"We went to dinner and had their flounder and blackened Mahi-Mahi. It was great! Appetizer (calamari) came out fast and was pretty good. Service was very friendly and helpful. Our dining room was well lit with colorful paintings on the wall.  We can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant mid afternoon. I had a fried flounder sandwich and French fries. My wife had cheese steak hogie with fries. Both were excellent. This is the second time we have been here and the wait staff, different each time, were excellent.  Their prices are very reasonable. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Went there Feb 13. No waiting and owners very nice. The salmon and vegetables were delicious and my husband loved the grouper. But there's no ambiance, music way too loud, lights too bright and unfriendly rushing waitress. I had a very nice glass of wine with dinner. I originally ordered a mixed drink but it had almost no alcohol so I sent it back. It just looked like water...could barely taste any scotch."}
{"text":"Im visiting from jersey and the food so far has only been okay, so I wasn't expecting anything great..well we walked into here and everything from the service to the food was outstanding... the hostess was super nice and spoke to us while we waited two minutes to be seated, then our waitress Britney came over right away and was absolutely wonderful! she was fast, friendly and made the experience that much better. out food was awesome- they served delicious bread while we browsed the menu- probably some of the best bread I've had at a restaurant then we had bruschetta for an app that was also really good...I ordered a cheese steak which I was a bit hesitant cause I'm from jersey and wej ace great have amazing cheese steaks, it came with au jous which is totally not the usual for cheese steaks but it was soo good! it was more of a French dip type sandwich but still great, my grandfather got a shrimp po'boy that he was also really pleased with and my boyfriend had manicotti and ate every last bite...I tried some of the manicotti and it was really yummy...overall I recommend this place for the traditional bar food...the service from Britney really made it a nice experience cause no matter how great food is if the service isn't good it takes away from the experience and we felt we got the best of both worlds here! the manger even held the door for us as we left..definitely coming back when we visit again!"}
{"text":"Gave them a second chance - horrible service followed by horrible food. The inside is not well kept - walls are covered with screws and missing pictures - ambiance fits the food quality and service."}
{"text":"What a joke. We are so disappointed and will never return. Food took almost an hour. It is nothing but frozen even down to their twice baked potato that was so bad I would not eat. Chicken parm sauce terrible, chicken frozen patties, bruschetta and joke and terrible. Most disappointing meal in many years. Hope this place leaves lake Wylie. My 9 yr old liked the chicken wings... That is the one star."}
{"text":"Tha food was good but we were expecting better.  We visited on a Tuesday night when it was rather slow.  We were a party of 4, and they sat us at a table for 8.  Right away we were disappointed. They were more interested in their wait staff than their customers.  Something about 4 people having to shout across a huge table during dinner, when most of the 4 party tables were empty.  We had three fish and one steak.  Everyone said their food was good but nothing was outstanding.  They have a bar, maybe it's a place to go for drinks."}
{"text":"I got lobster ravioli. Lobster was stringy and way too much alfredo.  Sauce was good, though. My hubby had prime rib and made yummy noises all the way through. Peel and eat shrimp were good and crab cakes were perfect. They brought us out a brownie Sunday for his birthday. Excellent wait staff."}
{"text":"My wife and I gave river rat a try for the first time.  We were very skeptical and had a exit plan just in case.  WE WERE VERY SURPRISED AND PLEASED.  Traditional home made Italian dishes.  Very good food!  We spoke to one of the owners and conversations about a name change.  He agreed it was needed.  Name doesn't fit the food offerings.  Defiantly going back."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!  Crab legs as big as my arm!! Yum. We will for sure be back to try it again."}
{"text":"Took close to hour and a half from sitting down to get entrees. An hour to get apps. Never mind waiting if redeemed with good food. Steaks were horrible and way over priced for quality of meat. They should seriously consider trying to get a reality restaurant rescue show to come visit. I couldn't even think about giving it a second chance."}
