{"text":"The outside of this place does not do the inside justice! Service and food is amazing :) I had the capreze salad and Gnocchi and for desert we shared a massive slice of Tiramisu. Everything was awesome taste, portion and quality wise. Our service provided by Leyla was top notch. Totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went here a couple was great but have since stopped going. Last visit the food was amazing but oh my God I think McDonald's has better service. The waitress didn't seem to think our table was as important as the rest of the resturant because everyone seemed to be getting their food but ours. It took her about 15 to get the dessert menu and at least half an hour to get out bill. I am not exaggerating when I said half an hour. So the only reason that they are getting a 3 star review is because the food is good the service is on the opposite end of the spectrum."}
{"text":"We went to a private engagement party at this restaurant and the food was so good we went back for our anniversary. The gnocchi pasta was delicious. We had small lamb skewers for an appetizer along with the pan seared rapini. We really enjoyed our meal and it was priced right."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. I would recommend the gnocchi or penne a la vodka. Staff are friendly. The restaurant has a classic old school Italian feel... Very large, banquet hall style room and furniture. 

Prices are very reasonable, and the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"I was there this Saturday and I love italian food. This place was horrible. I hated my pasta,husbands steak was full of fat and he hardly had any meat by the time he removed all the fat. The service was ok but way better italian food other places. Never returning back!!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have both been to Romanos before and had many great experiences. Unfortunately last night we had a very different experience for a friends birthday. 

Our food took quite a long time to come out, however we were a large group so this could be understandable. When my food finally came out I put one cut into my chicken and pulled out a long dark hair. I quietly alerted the waitress and all she did was say \"ok\" and take it away. 

About 20 minutes later the same woman came back with another plate of food set it on the table and said here you go. 

By this time everyone else had finished there food and I had eaten a bit of my fiances so I told her it was fine I didn't need it to which she replied I don't see the problem, we made you a new one. 

At this time I asked to speak to a manger, another waitress came over and I explained the situation and mentioned that I was extremely surprised no one had even apologized for the situation. She did finally apologize and said they would be removing it from the bill. Overall this situation in my opinion was very poorly handled and o would have expected much better customer service from this restaurant."}
{"text":"A large group of friends and I placed reservations at Romano's for their New Year's Eve fixed price menu. The appetizers were decent with lots of variety. We received Italian bread, fried calamari (which were rather bland), garden salad with balsamic vinegar, and antipasto stagione. For the entrée, we received pasta that was a little undercooked as it was still really chewy and dry in the inside. For the main course, we had an option of veal steak, chicken parmigiana, and grilled salmon. I selected the grilled salmon and I am extremely disappointed. The grilled salmon was very bland as there was no seasoning or sauce whatsoever. It was dry and lightly grilled but I find it to be comparable to lightly fried salmon as the outside was crispy. On the side was sweet mash potato and steamed vegetables that were overcooked. For desert, we had a choice of Apple crumble cheesecake and chocolate pecan cheesecake. It was good despite the texture that slightly indicated it came out of the freezer about 30 minutes ago. 

For the whole dinner, it costed me $65 plus 18% tip and tax. All together I paid a little less than $100 just for myself! I wouldn't have mind the price if the food quality was amazing as it is at fancier restaurant than the average restaurants I go to. But for average customer service and below average tasting food, it was not worth it. The only thing I liked from this experience was the one waitress that was very attentive and pleasant while the other waitresses did not bother with us as it was obvious we were fairly young (18 years old to be exact) and did not take us seriously. Oh and the bread of course! 

Definitely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We were introduced to this restaurant by a relative and we keep going back ! you get your money's worth and the food is delicious and the staff is like family there is a lot of variety to choose from and if you want to come on a Saturday night call ahead and make reservations as Romano's gets booked up and the pizzas and pastas are very good ! I highly recommend Romano's and I go all the time :)"}
{"text":"Dinner was fantastic. We had calamari for an appetizer, seafood linguini in a white wine sauce and fettuccine in a tomato cream sauce. It was exquisite! Our sever Gloria was phenomenal, warm and very attentive. We will most definitely return."}
{"text":"Pretty good. We just happened to try this out based on the reviews on yelp. I really enjoyed my meal. I ordered the Osso bucco $24.  Large portions and delicious.  The chicken parm was $19.  The ambiance was really nice. They had live music which was tasteful.  I would visit again for sure."}
{"text":"I must admit that I never heard about this place even though I have lived in Vaughan for over 20 years!  The location is off the beaten path but it is definitely a hidden gem!  The rustic decor and ambiance enhance the Classic Italian cuisine.  All the pasta dishes we tried were amazing...home made gnocchi and fettucini sooo good...and the thin crust pizza was good too.  Kids will love the spaghetti and meatballs! Loved the food so much that we decided to book our son's communion party here. It's definitely worth the trip to Romano's!"}
{"text":"The $10 pizza and pasta deal during the week is a terrific idea. Unfortunately the pizza was good, not great. One pasta dish was overcooked, not edible. Waitress was super efficient, even took it off the bill. Wouldn't return. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Been there twice and the folks in my group had good things to say about their meals. 

I have had pizza on both occasions and although they are of good size and very tasty, they were too salty for me. With concerns of high blood pressure, highly salted foods are best not eaten by me. 

I have read that the medical community doesn't recommend salt to pretty well anyone. Romano's should get with the program."}
{"text":"What a lovely evening.  My bf, our friend and I, came in on a Tuesday evening, just after they opened for dinner service.  There were already a few groups seated.  The restaurant is lovely.  It's intimate and romantic.  My best friend actually thought of doing her wedding reception here and I can see why.

The friend we were with actually knows Romano and said all the food there is delicious.  He had been there quite a few times.

We had bruschetta to start.  The bruschetta was top notch, fresh ingredients.  Very nice.  The bread was a little too crunchy for my liking, but I still enjoyed it.  I wanted to try everything but I ended up getting the rigatoni bolognese.  My by got the chicken parm and my friend got the gnocchi with meat sauce.  Servings were HUUUGE, just like all the other reviews have mentioned.  I had enough for a full meal the next day AND I was left stuffed...again!  Everything comes out piping hot.  Fresh as hell.  Their meat sauce is great and they do not skimp out on this.  I feel that my rigatoni could have been cooked like a minute longer, but it wasn't that serious.  It was still good.  My bf's chicken parm was the size of Jupiter, I swear.  Gigantic.  I tried some of his chicken and it was so soft!  The tenderest piece of chicken, overloaded with cheese.  YUM.  I did try a gnocchi and I'm not the biggest gnocchi fan in the first place, but my friend sure cleaned his plate!

Of course, since it was birthday dinner #5, I had to finish off with SOME dessert.  I ended up getting the \"best cherry cheesecake\".  I would have gotten the tiramisu, but they didn't have any.  Cheesecake was okay.  There was a tartness in the aftertaste of the cherry topping that wasn't the greatest.  However; the taste would last like 1 second and I'd be over it.  Seriously, almost any cheesecake is good to me.  

I am defs going to return.  Their food is high quality Italian and on the more affordable side!"}
{"text":"Got catering for a birthday from this restaurant and the food was delicious. Portions were also healthy, and everyone enjoyed their meal. Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner from start to finish!!! You can do no wrong with any item on the menu. In fact, the 4 of us ordered 3 appetizers and 3 mains. Wow!!! The fried calamari, lamb sticks and polenta fries were super yummy. The penne alla vodka, sonoma salad and grilled tiger shrimp were freakin' awesome.

Very friendly and knowledgable service. Ask for advice if you're not sure what to order. We did and we were unconditionally pleased.

Very nice decor too!!! A1 experience all the way..."}
{"text":"Great Food! But they hate Groupon!

FOOD
so my friend had this groupon and asked if I wanted to join. 

The bread wasn't to my liking. It was really dry and crumbly. I heard however the Italians like it this way. Is that true?

The waitress didn't give us the oil and vinegar and we had to ask for it.

We had the Mussels Marinara  - $10.00.  P.E.I. mussels, steamed in a white wine, and garlic spicy tomato marinara sauce.  It was delicious. The tomatoe sauce was perfect and mussel helping was generous for 2 two people.

We then had the Calabrese Pizza- $13.00 with Tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, red peppers, hot salami and black olives.  I honestly couldn't believe how great the pizza tasted. The combination of toppings were complemented each other and it was just a burst of happiness in my mouth.

We also shared the Spaghetti Calabrese - $15.00 which was spaghetti in a light tomato basil sauce with sliced italian sausage.  This was equally as good and I was just in heaven.

The total came to $38 before taxes.  

ENVIRONMENT
Driving up to the place seemed so odd. The restaurant looked so out of place as it looked like it was in the middle of all these manufacturer stores and it was in the middle of no where.

Walking inside however, it seemed like we were walking into a new world. It was dimly lit and there were different sections of the restaurant.

The washrooms even had little couches inside each stall (I have no idea why). It was probably to imitate an upper class feel.

WAIT STAFF
Now here is where the restaurant lost its 1 star.  When we first got in, they were going to seat us next to the door when the restaurant had tons of other space. I understand that most people we sitting in that area but please don't put us right next to the entrance. That's just rude. We asked to sit next to the section where most people were sitting. They accomodated us (well they should because there were other people sitting there too).

The waitress was really helpful in deciding what we should order. We really enjoyed our meal.  She even complimented me saying I had a nice spirit. At that point, I was good to give her a massive tip. HA.

Then when our bill came and we gave her the groupon, she looked at us in disbelief in the sense of \"how could you use this here?\".  I was stunned. She took the groupon coupon and left without a word or eye contact with us. She gave us the bill without even looking at us and told us we had to pay the taxes and gruitity from out of pocket because we didn't make the $45 groupon amount.

I was in complete shock. She was so great to us before and all of a sudden she became so cold. I understand we were using a groupon but I really enjoyed the place so much that I would have gladly gone back w/o a groupon. And isn't that the purpose of groupon? to introduce new customers to the restaurant? I honestly would have never found this place because it's in the middle of no where and hidden between all these manufcaturing and retail stores.  And I was going to give her a nice tip too so I'm not sure why she had this preconceived notion that well...I'm not exactly sure what she was thinking.


We still gave her a decent tip because our meal was great but I left with a sour taste."}
{"text":"Classic Italian Food.
The locals love this place and so do I. 
Any time your in need for some pasta, pizza, or even some fresh salads you should check out Romano's. 

My favourite is the rapini with baked beans. 
And the beet salad."}
{"text":"SO IMPRESSED with this family run restaurant. *huge portions 
*great ambiance except very loud 
*not exspensive 
*CLEAN washrooms 
*friendly staff
*pizzas are great appetizers 
*make a reaervation 
*fun atmosphere for birthdays 
*good for large groups 
*pasta done perfectly /al Dante 
*did I mention the portions are large 

All 6 of us brought home leftovers which is shocking cause we never do! Nothing negative to say about my experience here, I just didn't give it five stars because it wasn't the besssssst Italian ever. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Classic Italian done really well.
A typical Woodbridge joint, but sort of in the mid to upper category, somewhere in between. High value restaurant, quality food with large portions at the same time. You can definitely find better Italian if you look, but at this price point, it's a feel good restaurant with excellent service and good value. You know you won't go wrong - the type of place you can be a regular at. 

The pasta's are all done really well and their Secondi's are excellent. Ask for the specials because they usually have great ones and an impressive list of specials usually as well (typically 2 fishes, and 2 meats)

Some things that stand out are: their veal parmigiana, the ossobuco, the beet and arugula salad, the spaducci with rapini. 

They tend to get quite busy on the weekends, so definitely make a reservation and request the dining room (otherwise you'll end up in the bar area). They recently renovated so both are quite nice in any event. 

They have a promo going on for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday for family style dining ($99 for 4). I haven't done that yet, but that's a truly a great deal."}
{"text":"The service was unacceptable at Romano's, my family has never left a restaurant feeling so disrespected! It took awhile for our table to be cleared once we were done eating and when two girls finally came, they were having their own personal conversation. It was rude, and I couldn't even interject to ask for a dessert menu. We were left with an empty table for 10 minutes before giving up and flagging down the manager. Forget the dessert, we asked for the bill. Our waitress gave us the bill WITHOUT SAYING A WORD. Not a \"thank you\" or \"do you need a machine?\" 

The food was great, and the oysters were fresh. Service was a damn shame."}
{"text":"Came here last night for my boyfriends dads birthday. The whole experience was pretty mediocre. 

First of all, bf made the reso 3 weeks in advance yet a group of 10 of us were seated by the door? that's bs...everytime it opened it was brutal!

The server was alright but would disappear for long periods of time as there were other parties going on too. 

We got a bunch of apps, some were generously portioned, others not so much. 9 polenta fries for 10 dollars? do you know how cheap corn starch is!!!! Sorry to be a huge cheap-o but just saying.

I ordered the grilled chicken and the side option was veggies or pasta so I went for veggies. First of all, the piece of grilled chicken was paper thin, like it was actually a joke. I cook myself grilled chicken all the time at home and I would have probably eaten 3x that portion on my own. The veggies were not what I expected in terms of health benefits. Mushy peas and carrots like the ones you see at thanksgiving, and mashed potatoes. Clearly this restaurant does not possess fresh vegetables, you know like broccoli or peppers or any of the usual stuff you'd get. I refused to finish them because they are so high in carbs!!

My bf got a pizza which he finished in minutes. I'm still convinced it was a Dr. Oetker pizza. It looks like this one I used to make all the time when I was a kid LOL!

Luckily we didn't order dessert because we had cake waiting at home.

I wouldn't go back. I think the reason they get business, along with other mediocre Vaughan restaurants, is because people who live around there don't leave their area! 

Next time we all go out for dinner I'm picking the restaurant :)"}
