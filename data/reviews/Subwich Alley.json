{"text":"Excellent new place. Prices are great  and so is the food. Staff so friendly and down to earth. So glad I found this place we will be back. We had mild wings,chili cheese fries with pastrami  and chicken fingers. All excellent. Please note their hours are 11am to 9pm Monday thru saturday. Yelp has them closing at 10pm which is incorrect at the time of this post."}
{"text":"Ive eaten here twice so far. I had the tacos and the cheeseburger. All the food tastes perfectly homemade; like you're eating in your mom's kitchen! And you can't beat the prices anywhere, for how much food you get in return!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by it being attached to a gas station. This is quality, quality food!  This is the kind of hidden gem people search for!  While eating the food you can just taste and feel the freshness...  Even though tacos, wings and hot dogs are considered \"run of the mill\" foods, hey have found a way to make them exciting!  

I didn't pick up the food, however my husband said the lady working there wS extremely friendly and caring. Which doesn't surprise me based on the care I can tell they put into their food!  

Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Subwich Alley was located very close to my office. I could walk there in a few minutes. 

Its is now closed for business. I am sorry to see them go and wish the friendly owners best of luck."}
{"text":"Subwich Alley is the place to come for tacos,burgers,wings and subs. I had the cheeseburger and fries very well seasoned and delicious. The customer service was great very warm and friendly environment."}
{"text":"I just got a beef taco from this place, and it was so yummy! yes, it's in a gas station, but so is Robertos and a lot of other places.   I am a big big mexican food lover.  This beef taco hit the spot! It had tomatoes and lettuce and cheese and onion which gave it a little kick!  I recommend this place to any taco lover.  I am very picky when it comes too food, and I know I will be coming back here to try something else. The owner is super sweet too!"}
{"text":"This place has been open for under two months and I've probably been here almost ten times. That's saying a lot. Their food is amazing, the people are friendly and welcoming, and did I mention the food is amazing? Their hamburger is perfection and you cannot beat their prices anywhere you go, especially for the portion. $1.95 for a hamburger? You could pay the same at McDonald's for a very small fraction of the quality. They're consistently adding some new additions to the menu, which I've heard are great, so I'm definitely coming back for more (like I usually do.) I enjoy the atmosphere. It's a small, homey, clean joint with a nice setup. I'd recommend anyone and everyone to try Subwich Alley!"}
{"text":"Great place!! Good food and nice staff. I had the wings which were great. Enjoyed my lunch while watching a show. Just a hidden treat found while stopping for gas. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today. They've been open for a little less than a month so far, but they have their burgers perfected already. Juiciest burgers in Vegas. $4.25 for the burger special which includes their amazing burger, a side of fries, and a drink. All of their food is made to order. And the owners are some of the nicest people I've ever met. It's a little hole in the wall. But their food is totally worth it, trust me."}
{"text":"Been here 3-4 times and they never disappoint. food is made fresh how you order it everytime and have never had a bad experience with the food here. There are 2 things that keep it from getting a perfect 5 stars. First, I personally prefer soft shell tacos to hard shells, and you can only get hard shells here. They taste fine, but I would like the option. Secondly, this place needs its own way to place an order online. My office would probably eat here everyday as it is so close, but few people in a call center can take time off to place an order. Even accepting orders through Facebook, even Email or something would be sufficient for a small place like this! Until then, once or twice a month is the max my co-workers and I can handle. Great food, just a hassle ordering."}
