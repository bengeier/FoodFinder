{"text":"Great place. I've been twice and the staff is so nice. The selection is pretty good and prices were pretty reasonable. As a vegan, there are many options and plenty for you meat lovers too!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is horrible.  Had Classic Benedict.  Huge honking dry pieces of ham, oily over fried home fries (frozen not fresh).  My husband had Healthy Yolk with side Montreal style bagel.  Yogurt was horrible, cream cheese not fresh and fruit old.  Even the coffee cups were cheap and plastic.  Save your money - don't come.  Hospital food is better."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but after a couple of visits I remain unimpressed. The food isn't bad, it's just not great. If you're looking for a cheap,fast and palatable breakfast, this place is a good option; but it may leave you wanting more."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this spot for brunch before a show. There was a lineup but it moved quickly. We had the Signature dishes which were excellent; skillets and huevos rancheros. Service was quick and attentive. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast. Good food, quickly prepared. Excellent location, too."}
{"text":"We started our day at over easy and enjoyed it completely!
We were seated and immediately approached by our waitress. She had a great attitude, very friendly. Brought our coffee fast and it was really good. We found the menu filled with great options and ordered the smoked meat hash with poached eggs on top. Done to perfection and tasted great. I would go back to over easy in a heart beat
Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Went with family for brunch before Jays game.   Great spot.  Excellent food, laid back atmosphere and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"3 out of 5! Tons of options for brunch! Don't try anything from the healthy menu"}
{"text":"Brunch here was fantastic. Breakfast poutine was a favorite along with the banana caramel french toast. Food was fresh and delicious and portions were generous. Decor was charming and inviting. We would return!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had breakfast at Over Easy on Sunday, Sept. 15. I had two eggs over easy with bacon and my wife had the scrambled eggs with salmon and a small fruit bowl.

This place is totally overpriced for the quality they serve. We would not recommend to come here for breakfast."}
{"text":"We tried this place while visiting Toronto for the weekend and it is one of the best brunch places we've been to! Would definitely be a regular if this place was close to home. We got the \"eggs in a hole\" and \"huevos rancheros\" and loved both our dishes. The home fries that came as a side were perfectly crispy on the edges. Service was great, and they also give your table your own coffee pot so that you can refill your coffee cup as often as you'd like!"}
{"text":"I go to both the Bloor (across from ROM) and Yonge (inside Hotel Victoria) locations very often as I work by one and live by the other. They have a great, extensive menu and I have a few faves, including their fresh juices, the Skillet, the Eggstro, the Eggy Hammy Cheesy and Eggs in a Hole just to name a few. Oh, blueberry pancakes are good too! 

The Yonge St location is consistently great re: level of service, food portion and food quality and happy staff. My guess is that this is due to Kirsten or Kiersten, the manager. She is lovely, you can tell she cares about the customer and her team. I have chatted with her a few times. Despite the fact they are in a heavy tourist area , there is an atmosphere of commitment to service.  

Go to this location - you will love it. 

However, it is important to note that is a BIG difference from the Bloor location. A few years ago I went there with friends for brunch - food was a 50 minute wait (fine, getting slammed on the wknd is nothing new and things happen) but when it came, the food was burnt and cold. When we spoke to Glenn, the manager and brother of Kiersten who manages Yonge location, he really didn't care. The attitude of \"we are in a high traffic business/tourist area and can stand to lose customers\" was very obvious. Shocking for a family run business.  However,  I continued to go back as overall for my need the food is great and the location, selection and price work for me.

Then, not long ago, when I told Glenn of two back to back visits with substandard portions and quality at the Bloor location compared to their usual, he literally did not care and did not offer to comp even my coffee. As \"thanks\" for giving him important feedback about his business, and being a frequent/loyal customer, he only gave me attitude and said \"well, these things happen\". He did not acknowledge the issue at all. I mean at least PRETEND you care when you are speaking to a regular customer!?!

I won't go back to the Bloor location, he is rude and does not care about the customer. He shouldn't be speaking with customers as he ruins his own business!  That day the server even told me quote \"today we don't have our best staff in the kitchen\" as an excuse for the food issues. At least the server acknowledged there was an obvious problem. 

Moral of the review - go to the Yonge St location, inside hotel Victoria and enjoy!! But, SKIP the Bloor St location."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast for the whole family. Kids had chocolate chip pancakes (4 per serving!) and they loved it! 

Mom and Dad had the Skillet with eggs over easy (no pun intended). Excellent portions and extremely tasty.

Restaurant clean and staff friendly.

Highly recommended. We will be back for sure next time we are in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Meh, breakfast was okay. For the amount that my plate cost I was expecting a lot more. The potatoes were soggy, but the poached eggs were cooked nearly perfectly. Service was good."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place after walking around looking for pancakes last weekend...ya, neither of us got the pancakes...

The place is cute! Its homey and cute, kind of reminds of the antique roadshow cafe's we have back home. My guy got the breakfast poutine and I think he's gonna put a ring on it. I've surely been replaced.

I got eggs, bacon and toast. The standard 'Bev'. My food is always fine because I always order very basic things for breakfast.

Oh, they have booze! Why didn't I lead with that? I know thats all you drunkie's care about."}
{"text":"Classic eggs Benedict with pea meal bacon was awesome.  Staff was friendly and commiserated about Ontario alcohol serving laws.  Close to Union Station, so definitely will be stopping by next time I have time to kill waiting for a train."}
{"text":"I got the skillet with eggs, sausage, bacon, peppers, onions... It was delicious and so filling! Can't wait to come here next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"We had breakfast just once there while we stayed for one week in the hotel Victoria. Breakfast is not that great. Afterwards we went to the Marché Restaurant  near by, which offers by far the best breakfast."}
{"text":"The breakfast food is amazing. It's a little hard to find, being in a hotel, but don't miss this place."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a quick breakfast after a night out on the town in Toronto because it was relatively close to our hotel. The breakfast we got was pretty straight forward, an omelet and some scrambled eggs, with a couple sides of meat (sausage for me, bacon the the mrs), and a couple of juices. It was all pretty good and very reasonably priced. 

The food here was good enough that we came back the next day before leaving town, so that should more or less tell you how we felt about it!"}
{"text":"Settled in for a leisurely breakfast while I awaited my (Cleveland) family to arrive for a gastronomic tour of the city.

I had heard good things about the breakfast poutine so I decided to give it a try.  Coffee was good and flowing freely.  When the dish first arrived I thought boy, this looks small, but upon further review it was incredibly filling. It was filled with potatoes, ham, bacon, cheese curds, (runny) eggs and topped with hollandaise sauce...a great mixture.  The potatoes were diced small and fried giving them a french fry texture and crunch.

I also liked the fact that when I was served a side of toast, they asked if i wanted p4eanut butter for it (not normally done in the states) which was a nice touch, especially since i love peanut butter!  I took her up on it.

My server was very accommodating and pleasant to chat with.  A nice experience and a good meal.  Hope to be back!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time last week with the goal of having a good breakfast, and it was the case. Usually I'm not a fan of restaurants in hotels, as the food is usually pricey, and the food not so good, but I was satisfied with my experience.

The service was fast, and friendly. The price was also good for a nice portion. A great place to go for a good breakfast in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"This brightly coloured busy breakfast place, looks and feels as you would expect and the food was a 5/5.  If you are looking for a place to take your time and enjoy plenty of uninterrupted time at your table, this place won't disappoint - yes, this is another way of saying service isn't all that timely. We waited longer than normal wait times at the door,, at the table and for our meal.

All that said, our server was very pleasant and provided everything we needed or asked for."}
{"text":"Brunch was very average and overpriced for what was offered. It was nice to try but there are much better breakfast joints out there. They need to revamp their tasting menu and add some nice flavours to the recipes."}
{"text":"This breakfast joint is on point. Prices are fair. Portion sizes are good. The waitresses were friendly and helpful. The food was delicious. I got a chicken mushroom Swiss wrap with home fries and it was awesome. My one friend ordered banana pancakes and they were the best pancakes he has eaten. We are seriously considering going back again today."}
{"text":"Met my friends here for our usual Monday morning breakfast.  We all had various takes on eggs and the food was fine.  Highlights included the extra large eggs (x2), tasty \"home fries\" with crisp fried onions, and my friend's chicken sausages to which she gave the thumbs up.

The coffee was plentiful but tasteless.  (Both coffee and hot water for tea came in thermal carafes.  A nice touch, but I'm not sure it justified a cost of 2.50...especially for the tea!  We've had plenty of bottomless cups of coffee for a buck and a half in this town.)

On to the vibe.  Think hotel \"coffee shop\".  This branch of the chain is actually attached to the Hotel Victoria and you have to go through the lobby to get to it.  It's behind reception and has no outside windows.  I found it a bit gloomy and lifeless due to this fact.

Oh, and after reviewing 50 breakfast places in the last year, this is the only one that served coffee in PLASTIC MUGS.  Uggh.  (The tea came in a ceramic cup and saucer.)

This place won't appear on my \"best of\" list."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast/brunch restaurant in Hotel Victoria. You must go through the entrance of the hotel to get to the restaurant. It is on the left-hand side.  When I went, it was about fully occupied except at the bar where I sat on a Sunday early afternoon. Ordered The Skillet which was a hash with and bacon. Food came out quickly and service was decent. Price tag was very reasonable and would come back if craving a basic, nothing fancy brunch."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I've ever had. The breakfast poutine was amazing, and the wheat toast was surprisingly light and fluffy. I usually wouldn't care about the toast when I'm eating poutine, but it was good enough to mention. Good service, a put off coffee all to myself for $2.75... What's not to like?"}
{"text":"The wait to get in wasn't very long on a Sunday around 1pm. What was surprising was the wait for food. After placing our order we waited 25 minutes to get two skillets and two scrambled eggs. I had the vegetarian skillet which had home fries, two poached eggs and veggies mixed in + toast. If you were to order home fries as the side just a heads up they aren't wedges, they're very finely diced potatoes which I personally didn't prefer. Also if one person gets coffee they give you the jug. I will say that their prices are very reasonable. It was around $13 for a skillet."}
{"text":"A go-to restaurant for breakfast or lunch, delicious food (Got a Swiss mushroom chicken wrap with home fries). Love how their home fries are made, small cubes with sauteed onions and the wrap was on point, the chicken was not too dry and just right. Good price for their food, lots to choose from in the menu. Definitely will go again :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by Over Easy for Sunday brunch and didn't expect much from the 2 star rating. 

I ordered 2 eggs over easy with bacon, which came with home fries, a slice of tomato and toast. 

The eggs were good.
The bacon was undercooked (I should have asked for crispy bacon)
The home fries were not very good (I personally wouldn't have fried onions in there)
Service was very good.

Over all it was a pretty average breakfast place, a bit on the pricey side but with good service.

Next time I'll probably just go to Eggspectations."}
{"text":"Was craving Huevos Rancheros and I was not disappointed! 

To start, I was in before 10am so I was seated immediately with water and coffee served within 5 minutes, the whole experience was less than an hour as service was prompt. The coffee was served in individual coffee pots, which being the coffee addict I am I was super excited about. The huevos Rancheros was exactly what I needed to fulfill my craving and the home fries were great too.

With the added bonus of a variety of hot sauces to choose from, I will definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"Over easy is a cozy breakfast spot located inside of Hotel Victoria in Ontario. This place was highly recommended by a few locals. I checked out this spot @10am on Sunday and was immediately seated.

Our waiter was very energetic and outgoing, he recommended many of the popular plates along with a menu with a variety of different breakfast foods. The service was speedy and the food came out decent."}
{"text":"Variety on the menu, generous portions, well priced... a nice, no fuss breakfast restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. Had freshly squeezed orange juice, so good! Basic eggs, toast, bacon and hash browns for me. Hubby had Eggs in a Hole, very good as well! Our waitress Nicole was exceptional!"}
{"text":"Great service, but the food is just meh... I ordered club sandwich with home fries, surprisingly the fries are cold."}
{"text":"Got chocolate chip pancakes, bacon sausage scramble (came with potatoes), and fruit salad with orange juice. The meal was good. That feed 2 1/2 people. Although we thought it would be a bigger portion of all, it still was good. The pancakes are rather thin, not really fluffy. Orange juice portion is SMALL for the price. And I don't believe it's refillable for free. 

Restaurant looked clean overall."}
{"text":"Love it here. They bring pots of coffee to the table. Amazing menu selection and the staff are really nice. It's a little hard to find as it's in the lobby of a hotel."}
{"text":"Sometimes I wonder if I went to the same restaurant has other reviewers.  This spot is definitely not amazing, but I definitely disagree with a lot of the comments on here, so I'll go with the pros first.

The PROs:
When you get coffee, they just bring a jug and leave it on your table.  No having to try and track down waitresses for refills.  And by breakfast joint standards, the coffee is pretty good.

Portions are very large.  I got the huevos rancheros this time, and the whole plate was covered with food.  I ate the whole thing, but I probably shouldn't have.  

Good variety on the menu, lots of breakfast and lunch options for a group with people in the mood for different things.

The Meh:

The food is really kind of average.  It's not great, but it's not horrible.  It's a chain restaurant, and you get very average breakfast food.  Not really much else to say about it.

The CONs:

I will agree that the service here is horrible.  We had a group of 8 and our server acted like it was the biggest inconvenience of her life.  We really tried to be a respectful and easy group, but she didnt seem to care.  It also took her forever to bring our bill, and when we wanted to put some of it on a card and pay the rest in cash she seemed bewildered.  It's also good to know that they don't split bills when there are more than 6 people.

Overall, this place is just OK.  But I dont know what people are talking about with tiny portions...how big are you expecting???"}
{"text":"For the price you pay the food was not that good. I got the English breakfast; the eggs and homefries were really dry and over fried. Service was okay and quick but food quality lacking."}
{"text":"The meat lovers omelette was great. The staff is very responsive and courteous. ELLIOTT our sever was outstanding.  You have made me a happy customer."}
{"text":"Stop in and have breakfast at Over Easy -- you'll like it. At first glance you'll be wondering, \"where the fudge is it?' You gotta actually go thru the main entrance of the Hotel Victoria, walk by the small reception desk, and veer to your left to enter restaurant. I was staying at the hotel, so it didn't matter to me. But I tell ya, while I sat in the lobby waiting on some friends on our way to a Blue Jays game, I bet I saw 10-15 people, stop, open the hotel lobby door, walk in, appear discombobulated, and turn around. Too bad for those schmos, cause they missed a good breakfast. Don't make that mistake.
Over Easy has all you'd expect from a breakfast-lunch counter. Good portions and fair prices.   I'm from Chicago, and we have a million of these places, but this one holds up well. One day I had a traditional breakfast with over easy eggs, bacon, sausage, beans, fried, spuds, etc. And very good rye toast. On another morning I had hash with smoked meat, and tomatoes. Excellent choices both times. Very good coffee. The also have papers to read.
And one last reason to eat at Over Easy -- it ain't a chain, man.  Avoid all the chain restaurants!"}
{"text":"Myself and my wife were looking for a nice breakfast spot in downtown Toronto. We found it the minute we walked into 'Over Easy'. The place was bright and clean with hot delicious coffee. I had the Cajun Chicken Eggs Benedict and my wife had a breakfast wrap. We were both pleased with our meals and more than full when we left. We will probably go back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast. V. Good prices. Located inside victoria hotel in the heart of dowtown."}
{"text":"I come here faithfully from a Etobicoke to downtown Toronto when I'm in town, staff is consistent courteous. I like to think of myself as a bit of a breakfast afficionado, I love going for breakfast in the morning it's my favourite I'll take a good breakfast over dinner. They use large eggs everything is fresh family run business this is a must if you're in Toronto"}
{"text":"To be honest, the place was decent, nothing too bad but a few issues.

First, this place isn't easy to find, it's inside the hotel Victoria. There is a sign outside but doesn't really direct you.

Onto the food, 

The good and the bad

I had Montreal smoked meat Benny.  The sauce was delicous, the meat was good. It just kind of fell off at the actual egg. Not enough of run. Meh I can deal with it, overall it was good. It came with home fries, most places lack in this area.  This place had good home fries, just the addition of onions was interesting, they weren't overwhelmed the fries so that was good but I would avoid the onions. Between that and coffee and no mints is a recipe for bad breath.

The interesting.

They brought a jug of coffee when I ordered coffee, a convenience thing I assume. But I address that in my service part.

Lacking

Service was almost non existent. My waiter didn't even drop by during the meal, another waitress filled my water when it was empty.

If it wasn't for the pot of coffee that was brought to the table, I probably won't have a more then a cup of coffee. But that shouldn't replace service but add to it.

This place is okay but need work. I hate to be a group of 6 with that kind of service and being forced to pay 18%"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for brunch and it's just so good!
Servings are huge, service is great, food is tasty - it's always busy.

Love it."}
{"text":"Food: I got the huevos rancheros and it was delicious. The home fries were also great and they were great to also have a wide variety of hot sauces at the table. Everyone at my table enjoyed their meal. 

Service: the food took a long time (almost 45 mins) to come out but it looked like a really busy day in the restaurant. The server was very attentive and also was apologetic about a leak that was coming out of the ceiling. They were also able to accommodate large groups. 

Interior: there was a leak coming from the ceiling. The explanation we got was that the place was old. One of my friends had to adjust her chair and sit off to the side so that the water wouldn't drip on her or her food. They really need to get that fixed!

I would have given this place a 4/5 but had to deduct points for the leak as it really doesn't seem healthy or sanitary since it was getting onto the table and people's food and drink."}
{"text":"Major disappointment. They do a lot of advertising in WHERE and similar travel/tourist mags making themselves out to be a great breakfast spot. It isn't. I ordered a simple eggs dish and asked for fries with no salt. Instead, I simply got no fries. Had to explain I still wanted them so they bring out some of the greasiest fries I've had in years. If I was going to go somewhere so I could see my cholesterol level skyrocket. This would be it."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised about all the bad reviews. This place is actually the freshest breakfast around that doesn't come from processed boxed ready food. Always delicious truly 5 stars quality. I'm in town every month and I make sure to have it every time"}
{"text":"Great selection of delicious egg dishes.  Pancakes are lovely too.  Great service.   A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Came here after a night out in Toronto. I got the Huevos Rancheros. Overall, they were just ok. The eggs were a little too over easy, which I could have specified to cook them more had I known. They sat on top of a tortilla/wrap and came with a side of avocado and sour cream. Also, and this is my own taste, I'm not a fan of small fried potatoes for homefries.  My friend got the smoked salmon platter which was a generous portion. The bagel was very average and the salmon wasn't the freshest. They do give you a carafe of coffee though, and service was great. It could be the result of poor ordering, but I wasn't overly impressed."}
{"text":"It's a greasy spoon -- just not a particularly good one. I stopped in for lunch recently and had a BLT and coke. The BLT was okay, but was accompanied by a bowl of mixed greens that was supposed to pass for a salad (some of which were far past their prime -- soggy arugula, ew). Price was a bit steep (My total bill was $13, but considering it's on Bloor across from the museum I suppose their overhead is high). Service was efficient, but I wouldn't call it friendly or welcoming. Also, the restaurant is really cramped and currently there's all this construction in front. Not the most atmospheric of places.

Bottom line: you're not going to hate it, but you're not going to leave loving it, either."}
{"text":"I think I like the Bloor location one a bit better. Same chain, awkward bathroom since it's shared with the hotel.

Food still decent."}
{"text":"Over Easy touts themselves as the \"best breakfast in Toronto\", ugh no.  I had the Huevos Rancheros and the slice of avocado they gave me had some weird brown stuff on it that wasn't part of the avocado and if it was \"turning\", they shouldn't have served it.  This place is over priced...$6 for a smoothie??....And very generic.  I won't waste my time again."}
{"text":"This restaurant probably tops my list even compared to my other favorites breakfast spot within the Greater Toronto Area. The service is impeccable (prompt, attentive and friendly), however what makes this restaurant stands out is probably its unique menu selection which I personally would love to come back and try more. I ordered The Skillet and the ingredients used (ham, sausage, bacon and potatoes) are all fresh and top quality. Attention of detail is exercised in order to cook all the ingredients right and they did just that.

It is hard to rate a breakfast place a five star as I would held a much more rigorous standard to it rather than just getting the egg cooked correctly - however, this place makes it almost overly easy to get it right, the perfection of both food and service of a breakfast establishment! Will I return? without a question!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the outside or decor inside, this place has some of the best breakfast and the best value for your dollar!  I had the lox and my coworker had the eggs benedict.  Both were amazing! Service was great! Meal left me full.  Food was absolutely fresh.  I haven't had breakfast that good in a while.  Came in on the Sunday before Canadian Thanksgiving.  Wasn't too busy and was sat immediately.  Go!"}
{"text":"Meh indeed. Met some friends for a mid-morning breakfast one day. Eggs benedict with salmon were just average, with an uninspiring hollandaise. Home fries weren't seasoned very well at all. The machine-generated cappuccino was quite weak.

Service was very nice and friendly. But the ambience didn't impress me much, feeling too bright and open, more like a restaurant you'd find in a mall."}
{"text":"Great: blueberry pancakes and chicken sausage. Real maple syrup without having to ask or be charged extra."}
{"text":"I've been twice for breakfast. The last time I ordered the poach egg (medium) and it was nicely cooked. The yolk was still runny...makes me wonder if this is medium cooked poach egg!  

The breakfast dishes come with home fries (which are nicely seasoned including onion and parsley flakes) and tomato and toast.

My complaint would be the expensive orange juice but I guess that happens when you stop drinking caffeinated drinks.

The restaurant was not busy (nor was it busy the last time I was there) and the service was friendly.

Would I return here out of my own volition? No."}
{"text":"Love this place. My #1 choice for a hangover cure is their eggs bruschetta. The home fries do the rest. Breakfast burrito and the skillet are also amazing. Have gotten great service every time we've been here - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I would breakfast eat here every day if I could. Hands down one of the most delicious meals I've had. I was in a group of 10 and we all loved everything! 

The atmosphere and style of the restaurant is really nothing special, just your typical little breakfast place. Everything tasted so good though. I had the huevos rancheros with home fries and those home fries gave me life. Such good seasoning and perfectly cooked. 

The mimosas/screw drivers were made with freshly squeezed orange juice and tasted amazing. Good OJ really does make a big difference. 

The prices were very reasonable and we all left happy. We also had really good service, especially for being in a party of 10."}
{"text":"The classic eggs Benedict was exactly what I was looking for. I had the home fries instead of the French fries as they were grilled with onions, and I was told they were equally as crispy. The service was good. I did have to flag the guy down for a second drink (greyhound, very yummy), not a problem but the reason I have 4 instead of 5 stars. I do recommend if your are wondering the streets of Toronto."}
{"text":"Good place with tones of potential. Service could be improved and staff could be more attentive. Exception to Mr. Elliott who is great at what he does. It always great when he is the one taking care of our table."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for awhile b/c it had some interesting signature dishes I wanted to try.  One of my favourite dishes at another breakfast place is a toasted bagel cut in half with 2 over easy eggs in the holes, covered in cheese and bacon.  They had a very similar dish here as a signature meal, so I had to try it.  I was really impressed.  I love the Montreal bagel.  Next time I will ask that the yolk is more runny though!  The home fries were pretty good with onions and herbs mixed in.  

I like the cute little pot that the coffee comes in.  Each table gets one, so it's nice not having to flag down a waiter all the time.  

Prices were pretty cheap and service was good.  I'd come back to try some of their other signature dishes.  

Ones I'd like to try:  eggs bruschetta, breakfast burrito and huevos rancheros!"}
{"text":"Everything was good except I've had better pea meal bacon. The Montreal Hash was very tasty and very filling. The veggie skillet had actual real vegetables and tasted great. Get the hollandaise on the side, though. Even the wheat bread was fresh."}
{"text":"Great breakfast diner! Their home fries are the best! They are mixed with onions and have the perfect seasoning. I would come here just to order those! We ordered the Eggs Bruschetta, Eggs in a Hole and the Breakfast Burrito. None disappointed! Great flavor, friendly service, but there is a short wait for food. Fresh coffee pots brought to the table. Bloody Caesar and Mimosas are delicious as well."}
{"text":"If I could give a million stars I would. This was our first time in Canda and I didn't want to go to the same restaurant twice, but OMG, we had to. We went two days in a row for breakfast and I will return to Toronto just to go to Over Easy (no joke). The Eggs in A Whole were out of this world, and the Cornflake French Toast - HEAVEN IN YOUR MOUTH. I keept talking about this days after our trip, and I cannot wait to get back here for this breakfast. OMG. OMG. OMG."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place for brunch. Staff friendly. Food is very good and their home fries are delish. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Went there for a work meeting and was really impressed with the service! The skillet was wonderful and I would definitely go back! Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"I'm never going back

1) Portions are tiny. $11 for a very poor version of eggs benedict and some home fries? Are you insane?

2) Coffee is crazy weak. I would rather drink office coffee.

My experience with the service: 

They were nonexistent unless you mug them. The sugar jar had huge chunks, which made it impossible to use. I asked for it to be replaced... it was the exact same thing. I doubt he did anything.

Finally: We drop $80 on a $65 bill.... the change comes back with NO RECEIPT and only $7 in change. WTF, We had to demand they bring us more money, and they STILL didn't bring the receipt. I have to suspect fraud."}
{"text":"Great little cafe attached to Hotel Victoria. Went for breakfast two days in a row. Day one I had the classic eggs Benedict which were quite good. Day two I had the Cajun spiced chicken eggs Benedict and those were very tasty as well. Hot fresh coffee and the hash browns were excellent."}
{"text":"I stopped in on a business trip to Toronto and this place was perfect! It is a comfy restaurant with fantastic food and decent prices. I got the western omelette with home fries and it was cooked perfectly! The wait staff is also attentive and so friendly. Should I find myself in Toronto again...I'll be back."}
{"text":"Any time I'm in Toronto I come here for breakfast, omelettes are awesome vegetables are always fresh. Staff is super nice, and food always comes out quickly and hot"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant because of the good reviews. Overall it was alright, but nothing special. I ordered the smoked salmon benedict and it was cooked well but otherwise rather bland. They did offer 3 different hot sauces though which helped (frank's red hot, tabasco, and sriracha). My friend ordered the skillet which was good but again, nothing special. 
The restaurant is nice and clean, very spacious and in a great downtown location. All the staff were very friendly too. 
I probably won't return as there are so many other great brunch restaurants in the downtown core, but it's good for a simple and quick meal."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, old fashioned atmosphere. But food is burnt and over priced. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Very nice breakfast. Potatoes were good too. And you get a huge pot of HOT coffee! Can't leave here hungry. Friendly and attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"A very welcome find!! After expensive hotel breakfasts and nothing in the union Station area - someone recommended this place!! Can I just say THANK YOU!
It's well priced bordering on cheap... The menu rocks and the staff were young, hip, and welcoming.. Hmm ok maybe the host who seated us could have put his phone down - but all in all I strongly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Extensive menu to meet a variety of tastes. Veggie scramble was delish. Attentive and accommodating staff."}
{"text":"My Dad and I were visiting Toronto today and this place was a recommendation from the concierge at the Fairmont Royal York. We were not disappointed. Dad had the English breakfast and I had a Tuscan omelette with a side of chicken sausage. Everything was delicious!!! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in the downtown core!"}
{"text":"Classic breakfast and brunch food. We got a veggie omelette and eggs benny. The omelette was alright but the eggs Benedict was delicious. Pancakes were fluffy and good."}
{"text":"While on a trip in Toronto my boyfriend and I decided to have some brunch before we headed back to the states. I am a huge branch fan and anytime I try somewhere new I always try their eggs Benedict trying to see if they can make it stand out compared to all the other brunch places that I've been to. So I ordered the eggs Benedict and the house fries and they were just OK. There was nothing special about them they tasted decent but the thing that really made me not enjoy them as they overcooked my yoke.  I am the person who enjoys a runny yolk with her eggs Benedict. And what made me more upset is that they overcooked both of them and so it was not enjoyable it was on the dryer side. If you're in the area and would just like a place to go for brunch this wouldn't be my number one choice but it isn't a bad choice it's just not one that stands out."}
{"text":"Service is alright. I ordered the eggy cheesy thing for my mom...she was not impressed. I had the Californian, my avocado did not look fresh. The home fries were great !"}
{"text":"The service was great and friendly. The atmosphere is relaxing and quiet. The poached eggs bruschetta was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place definitely has a cute diner vibe given the decor. The service is also like a diner with the waitresses being very friendly and attentive. They have a very large breakfast menu and it also includes healthy options so it is a good place to go if you have a lot of various food tastes to satisfy. I had a smoothie as well as their breakfast poutine. I was very happy with the breakfast poutine, however I was surprised that I was not asked how i wanted the eggs to be poached. I think that would be my only gripe and it's a very small"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, part of an old hotel with all the decor of the early 1900s. Tables and chairs make it a quaint coffee bar feel.  Service was great and friendly.  Food was great and served quickly.  Would definitely eat here again when in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"As a single woman \"of a certain age,\" I like to think that those days when restaurants gave preferential treatment to couples and families are over. But no. I was offered a teeny tiny 3/4 size single table next to a family with two babies, complete with a stroller blocking what little access space there was to the single chair. I said no. Next, I was offered another barely there table next to the washroom. I said no. Then I spotted a couple vacating a small booth, and asked if I could take that. No, I was told, that was for the couple behind me. But I was there first? Didn't matter. That,despite the fact that there was a single woman clearly occupying a table for four by herself. I pointed this out. Oh, but we're getting full now. Would I like to sit at the bar? It was, I pointed out, 10:00 AM. No thanks, I said, and left."}
{"text":"Nestled inside a boutique Queen Victoria Hotel, this place offers the best brunch menu! My favourite here is 2 eggs with small potatoes and 2 ginormous Chicken Sauseeeeeeege...the best sauseeeege in the down town core!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick breakfast and opted for their Club Sandwich which came with tiny potato cubes and an unlimited supply of coffee. :)

That club sandwich was absolutely delicious. That chicken was superb and the bacon was amazing. Truly a great sandwich.. but the side potato cubes were quite greasy and forgettable. 

Coffee was decent, refills came quick. Good service.

Try that Club sandwich, very good. Price-tag is OK."}
{"text":"The plates are huge, go for the omelettes! I had to have an over easy huevos rancheros and though the tortilla was disappointing the eggs and rancheros part weren't too bad.. coffee was OK and OJ was freshly squeezed so that was great. I would try it again but get a different plate."}
{"text":"What crap! Went in for breakfast today (Sunday) at 12:30p and it's now 1:12p and no food has arrived at our table. Waiter asked what we ordered to check on the status and comes back a few minutes later to tell me the kitchen lost the order. After that we were approached by a manager who said the waiter forgot to put in our order and it would be out in 10 min. We just up and left, we had a flight to catch and being from NY we know that you don't want go be late to the airport. I think it annoyed me more that we sat right next to the bar/waiter station and our waiter looked at is several times during our 45 minute wait and never realized he forgot us. So disgraceful. And no it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"Food  here is really good and the service is fast and friendly. I ordered the baked eggs with cheese, bacon and mushrooms and it was so much to eat. I like how we order coffee and they bring a pot of it!  Well priced to boot."}
{"text":"Cute décor. 
Tip: you have to go into the hotel and then go to the left to find the restaurant.
I ordered the breakfast poutine and my sister ordered the breakfast burrito and we split it. Both were delicious with decent prices. It was a fun little find when we were starving and getting ready to go to the Hockey Hall of Fame."}
{"text":"I'm certainly a fan of the breakfast Poutine at Over Easy. For travelers, this is one of the nicest little breakfast places in downtown Toronto. Food is delicious and reasonably-priced."}
{"text":"One of the few places that's opened for breakfast at 0800 or earlier on a weekend. Some say you shouldn't eat at restaurants attached to hotels because it's generally more expensive. But the prices are about average for a downtown restaurant. 

Large colourful space with very high ceilings. The menu is one of the most extensive breakfast menus I've seen in a long time! We sat in a booth and ordered a tea, water, sandwich and I had the Montreal smoked meat Benny that came with a small salad. The service was fast, but we were only given one set of cutlery. The smoked meat eggs benedict tasted amazing with so much flavour! Unfortunately, after finishing 60% of the meal I found a piece of hair in my Benny. I felt bad for letting them know but I was still hungry and wanted to have more. I eventually called them over and they offered to make me another plate. For some reason the second plate didn't taste as good as the first one. Maybe because both eggs were over done and the yolks were no longer runny.

I wasn't charged for my eggs benedict because of the incident and I left stuffed. The service was impeccable and accidents can happen at anytime."}
{"text":"This is a decent breakfast place located within Hotel Victoria (head to the left after entering the hotel lobby). The overall vibe/decor is very traditional and homestyle. I ordered the Big Breakfast which came with toast (2 full pieces cut in half), one single pancake, 2 eggs, a lot of bacon (choice of sausage or ham as well), a slice of tomato, baked beans and a whole lot of homefries. If you don't like any of the sides, too bad because there are no substitutions. Even if you don't want baked beans and just want another slice of tomato.... 

The pancake wasn't very fluffy, which was disappointing (also glad I didn't order a stack of pancakes). The bacon looks like it could've been grilled more colour-wise but it was super crispy! Asked to eggs to be over easy and they came as requested. Homefries were done very nicely - they're cooked with some onions, which gave it more flavour!

If you don't see any of the spreads you want in the jar on the table for your toast, simply ask them! My table's jar didn't have peanut butter but they gladly brought me a couple packs."}
{"text":"Nice homely restaurant with a coat rack for people going to work.  It had nice pussy willow branches arrangement.  Restroom was downstairs and took a long to get to!  So if you really needed to go, make sure you start walking 5 minutes early!  

The eggs bruschetta was a good dish (not worth 9.25 though!)  The Western omelette was okay, not great."}
{"text":"This restaurant is hidden inside a hotel but the decor is super cute and the wait is not long at all. FANTASTIC option for vegetarians. 

We got the Californian omelette which had roasted tomatoes, avocados, asparagus and onions. We had a side of home fries (amazing) and salad (which was okay). Their rye bread is super interesting and everything is very reasonably priced! (~12 per meal). 

I would definitely come back and try some of their other stuff."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch during my birthday trip to Toronto. We got to the restaurant around 10:20 and had to wait less than 5 minutes for a table. 

Our waiter was very efficient and knowledgeable. The menu was very extensive and full of variety. 

I ordered the vegetarian omelette which was very hearty and filling. The meal also came with home fries and toast. 

For a total of $16 (including coffee) this meal was well worth it seeing as thought I did not eat again until 4pm"}
{"text":"I was visiting my girlfriend in Toronto and we were stuck on what to get for breakfast. So she looked up places and we stumbled across over easy. The wait can be a bit long because it does get busy what with people from the hotel eating there and all but it is so worth it. I've had their classic eggs Benedict, the eggstro and the breakfast poutine. Everything was fantastic. The servers there are so friendly and it's immediately became a favorite of ours. I will always come back here when I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my boyfriend. It's located just to the left of the front desk of a hotel.

My boyfriend ordered a mimosa and got the Eggy Hammy Cheesy while I ordered the Tomato & Avocado Eggs Benedict. We both got home fries with our entrées. I felt the food was pretty good with pretty generous portion sizes! I felt the home fries were a bit under-seasoned, but tasty nonetheless. If anything, I felt the food was a bit overpriced for what it was, especially the mimosa being ~$10 itself. Atmosphere is nice and casual, and our waitress was very lovely and friendly! All in all, I would give it about a 3.75/5. :) Definitely not a bad place to try if you're in the area but you're not missing out on too much if you can't stop in! Has a very cozy vibe in my opinion, and a great place if you want a quick breakfast/brunch bite. :)"}
{"text":"We were in town on vacation and happened upon this place, which was close to our hotel. There was a line (in fact, there was a line out the door the entire time we were eating), but we were seated pretty quickly. We ordered coffee, and loved that they brought us our own pot of it for the table. I had basic eggs, toast and potatoes, which were really good, and my husband had some kind of egg/cheese skillet with mushrooms, which he said was amazing. We had great service - overall, a great start to the day."}
{"text":"When we arrived we waited about 10 minutes until someone came over to notice us to seat us. The service after that was okay. The food was not good very greasy. The toast was not toasted and the eggs tasted funny. Would not go back ever."}
{"text":"Very nice and organized. The food is delicious. The entrance is through Victoria's hotel.
Doesn't smell like breakfast places ( egg and meet). 
Great for family and groups.
Definitely I recommend it."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here while we were staying in the city. It was pretty good and not too expensive. Quiet little place tucked inside a hotel lobby. I would recommend it for breakfast."}
{"text":"Delicious food and really great service.  We were visiting from New York and had Sunday brunch for 7 and they held a table for us just from calling in 10 minutes before, and they were busy!!  I would definitely go back next time we visit Toronto."}
{"text":"Omg. When I saw someone call out the potatoes at breakfast I thought it a bit odd. They are potatoes. What can be special. But wow!!! These things are portals to some previously unknown potato universe. I need to come back. Or perhaps you can open a Boston location"}
{"text":"Had the best breakfast ever. Gotta do the Something Hammy Cheesy thing. Outstanding. 

Wait staff...great people."}
{"text":"This one is very easy to miss. I walked past it twice while looking for it. There's a very small sign that sticks out above the sidewalk that you is easy to overlook. The entrance is through the Hotel Victoria lobby and to the left. 

I ordered the huevos rancheros and was impressed, it was quite good. The food came relatively quickly and the service was friendly, but I showed up early on a weekday and beat the rush. The restaurant definitely picked up as I was finishing my meal. I was less impressed with the price as it was pricier than I would have liked, but gripes with cost aside I think this is a fine choice for breakfast food in the area."}
