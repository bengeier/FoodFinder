{"text":"Had a Philly Cheesesteak $7 for half w Curly fries $4. Worst Philly Cheesesteak ever... It didn't even have Cheese on it??!!!!  For $7 I would expect a sandwich, side and a drink.  Way over priced for bad food.  Only giving 2 stars because the curly fries were really good.  I should've had Maki of Japan's 2 entree for $5.99 deal."}
{"text":"Hopefully this place goes under fast. Way too long of a wait for mall food. When we did get our food it was cold so we sent it back to be cooked again. The employee wanted to argue with us saying he just cooked it. You didbt cook it long enough bud. Meanwhile, the people who order in front of us had eaten and left. The order came out wrong for a second time. Lousy place to eat."}
{"text":"Big fun food is what Juicy's is all about. It is the only place in town to get turkey legs and funnel cakes and the burger is one of the best in Charlotte. Try the western bacon cheeseburger it is my favorite, or the Curly Fries which are enormous. Maybe not great for the diet but good for the soul... If you at at SouthPark mall it is a must do."}
