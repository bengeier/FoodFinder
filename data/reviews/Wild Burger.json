{"text":"I live in the area, so I was excited when this place opened up last year.  Since then I've been here twice.  Once I ordered a burger with duck fat fries,  and once I had a the rabbit burger.  I had high hopes for the burger with duck fat fries.. but they were just okay. I didn't care so much for the rabbit burger, but I don't hold that against wild burger I was just trying something new. Both times I felt a little gouged on the price. On their website they have the details of their daily deals, most centering on having a pint with dinner. But i find it irritating that there are no prices for their regular menu.  Give it a try if you want to try eating an exotic animal in burger form. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The groupon coupon is great $10 for $20 for food.  I love the string onion rings.  Burger is big and juicy.  I do not like the casino, the smoke invades your nostrils when you open the door."}
{"text":"We arrived in Toronto Canada on business Friday May 15th - We walked down Mount Pleasant street and saw Wild Burger - we walked past it a bit but were drawn back by the exotic menu options. We arrived back at the front door and were greeted with some current up tempo music. Upon examining the menu the gentleman who was taking orders made the Camel Burger suggestion My partner and I were told that if we also each got a side we'd get a drink included - I ordered the Kangaroo burger and my friend ordered the camel burger - I had the fries cooked in duck fat and he had the extreme beans - everything was pretty pricey but the exotic meat justified a higher price - more so with it having to imported - The fried were 6 and the extreme beans were 8 - They had many homemade sauces - all were yummy - they even had a at your own risk sauce which was very spicy (perfect for me) with a tinge of sweetness. The drink size was tiny - The camel burger was amazing - both were cooked medium - we like medium rare but maybe it wouldn't have been safe. The kangaroo burger was small and the meat seemed unseasoned - maybe just the taste of kangaroo meat but it wasn't awesome or terrible. The fries were super tasty (I kept dipping them in a blend of their beware sauce and ketchup) The extreme beans were a waste of 8 dollars - half of them the batter came off the bean, they were hardly pickled, or were hollow and substance-less. The other half were okay at best. Over all the meal was about $60 and was worth the experience - I might go back before I leave for the Jerk Rabbit Burger."}
{"text":"This is a really fun take on the burger. Sure, you can get beef, chicken, or veggie. But they also have camel, ostrich, kangaroo, and elk. Most of their meats are local and/or wild.  Staff are enthusiastic and friendly; service and presentation are simple and straightforward. You get your burger and side on a wooden plank and choose some home-made sauces.   We had the ostrich (with feta, artichokes, roasted red pepper, grilled onion, and fried egg), the wild boar (with Greek spices, boursin, sundried tomato pesto, saut√©ed onions, and wild mushrooms) and the duck fat garlic fries. Everything was very flavourful, and my companion commented on good textures. For a simple meal, it was surprisingly fun.   NB not wheelchair accessible."}
{"text":"Walking by earlier today this new restaurant in the neighbourhood caught my eye so decided to grab a burger for takeout. I ordered the camel burger just for the novelty of trying something new and not sure what to expect.   The patty itself was very well flavoured and was cooked just right. The burger was served over crisp lettuce and onion, a slice of fresh tomato and covered with melted brie. There were also a few sauces that gave it just a bit of welcome spice.  At almost $15 (not including any sides or a drink) the burger isn't cheap, however, I felt like it was good value after eating it. Also, not sure how much camel should cost as I've never had it before. If I remember correctly it was one of the more expensive burgers on the menu, and I will definitely be returning to try some of the others."}
{"text":"I went after looking for burgers on Yelp and then going on the website and they look like they closed down :( door locked lights off and a real estate lock on the door. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat!  I've been to the Toronto location a couple of times, we very much enjoyed it but I live in Ajax, so you can imagine I was quite excited about a location coming to Whitby. Upon heading over there for dinner last week, I was more pleasantly surprised than expected. This location is much bigger, and very nicely appointed in a kind of outdoor, Wild game type of way. Moose and antlers on the wall, tree wood tables and a neat concept that I've only seen in Europe; a large communal table as sort of a social centre.  As always, I love the camel burger so I stuck with that.  Our son and a guest  both had a Wild & Spicy Burger each.  We grabbed some of the garlic fries, deep fried pickles, kettle chips and fried pickles and shared amongst us. They were all good, but I'm kind of hooked on the deep fried picks so I'm very biased towards those.  Other sides are good as well, although maybe a coupe extra pieces in each might be nice.  Forget dessert, we were all too full. Service was good, food arrived all at the same time although I notice one of the plates was up under the heat lamp for a couple minutes before the other 3 plates got to the shelf between the kitchen and bar area.  I was driving so we all had soda although it looks like they have some decent craft beers.  Good experience.  If I had to come up with an improvement, maybe increase the portion of each of the sides just a little (burgers are a perfect size) and maybe save a couple pesos as well. I think we cashed out for about 75 bucks, 4 of us so it's not crazy pricing but we're all looking for a deal right?  There's an awesome big seat theatre next to it, so I think we'll drop in for a dessert and see a movie. I'll review that later!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  The menu promised a lot but delivered very little on flavour. We visit a variety of Burger places, and gourmet ones, and this one failed on so many levels.    The Burger patties were mushy,  bun cold and the topics didn't enhance the flavour.  There was not any good seasoning to bring the flavours together,  not even any salt.  The Burger fell apart as the bun crumbled around.  I had the Ontario wild boar and my husband had the wild spicy beef. Both huge disappointment.    To top it all,  our bill was $60!!!! Huge price tag for not much at all.    The wild nachos were good,  had some ingredients still frozen on it,  but they were different enough to stand out as gourmet nachos with kettle chips.    Definitely would not return.  Other customers we spoke to felt the same and one even walked out with a half eaten Burger left behind.    There are better Burger joints in Whitby at much better prices than this place.  Skip it."}
{"text":"We've been to Wild Burger now 3 times and I think that if they can be just a bit more consistent with how long it takes to get food, they'll be in great shape. We're vegetarians, so we've only had the black bean burger. That being said, they make the patty in house and it is very tasty - moist and with a lot of flavor. We have no complaints about the quality of the food. The service has been a bit uneven. First off, it isn't service per se- you order at the counter, they deliver food to your table, but otherwise, it is self-serve from there. Two times we have been there, the food has been relatively quick. Once, it was inordinately slow. I think if the kitchen is a bit more efficient, it will be a great spot for a veggie burger."}
{"text":"I just recently went to wild burger. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!  My friend had told me about the place and how they offered variety of wild game!  I was eager to try . My friend and I went and had the east coast crab and birch venison . The meat just melted in your mouth . So delicious . Also I love the fact they l that they have poutine!  You can also get any  burger made as a poutine!  I think the owners we're brilliant with this concept.  They also have gluten free options available.  It's the perfect place to go with friends or family. There is something for everyone."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went in for dinner and both chose the crispy fried chicken breast sandwich it comes with cheddar cheese lettuce tomatoes and a yummy sauce + I had onion rings, also yum! she had fries. the chicken was cooked perfectly! We both had soft drinks and it was $21.  You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Not too smokey tonight sometimes it can come in from the casino."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new place and the burgers are amazing. Such a large and unique variety of burgers, from elk to kangaroo to crab to veggie. Very fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Live review action!! I'm sitting at the grand opening, choosing between the most delicious burgers on the menu, Moroccan lamb, chimichuri elk, lentil veggie (which as a full meatertarian, has transformed my view of veggie food). This place really has done something different with the burger craze, they are harvesting local meats, using what's native and great about Canada and promoting unique fusions of both meat and sauce. I look forward to the variety of maritime inspired burgers, especially the east coast crab!! Everything was spot on exceptional tonight and I know this place will be a burgerlicious success!!"}
{"text":"The service was outstanding. Portions were large. The food was good but didn't meet my expectations. I have had better burgers and the natcos should be called something else as they are kettle chips and pork rinds - good but not natchos. Not sure I will go back. Service is what made the experience good."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I feel about the burger I had at Wild Burger. Was the beef patty nicely cooked and flavourful? Yes, albeit a little over-peppered. Was their home made blackberry sauce unique and perfectly suited to the burger I ordered? Absolutely. Other toppings? The ones that were present were good. The bun? The bun was alright, but too much bun for the size of the patty I thought.   The whole of the burger didn't taste greater than the sum of its parts. However, when adding the personable service, relaxing decor and music, delicious sides and five dollar Mill St. pints that come with ordering dinner-the whole becomes something that I haven't found anywhere else in the neighborhood.   I can't help but think that if more of the fare reflected the Canadiana adorning the charming little place I would have liked it more (yielding a simpler menu with more focus on being the best staple burger).  Pound for pound I have to say when I'm jonesing for a big juicy burger in the neighbourhood, I'm probably going to think of Fat Phil's burger. But for having an overall excellent casual dine-in dinner, Wild Burger wins by a landslide.   I'm sure the kangaroo or ostrich burgers live up to the standards of the rest of the food here, but I was most happy about the service, awesome sides, beer, charming ambience and the sauces. The sauces! I walked out after dinner with a couple nicely sized (and reusable) jars of their amazing sauces for only six dollars each!"}
{"text":"Great little hole-in-the-wall. A little bit of Ossington in midtown (north Toronto doesn't start until you cross Eglinton - get that right, people). Fun & funky burger selection, non-traditional toppings, home-made sauces. Craft beers. Duck fat fries. The onion rings are awesome. Good daily specials. And here's how you can tell you're eating real food, not meat-flavored additives: you feel full."}
{"text":"Burger was pretty tasty BUT ... We ordered the blonde beer on tap and the employee couldn't get the beer tap to work and says she will get some help. Fine. Manager comes and cannot get it working - we are watching him. Then a minute later brings us amber beers. I asked if this was the blonde. He says yes - even tho I saw he couldn't get the tap working from my seat.  But I didn't think it was worth an arguement. Fifteen minutes later other customers are served blonde beers ... it was SO obvious he lied to our faces!!!!  Not cool."}
{"text":"This place is so cool. They have 18 different burgers to choose from and 16 different meats. I don't know if I'm brave enough to try the kangaroo or camel, but the wild and spicy beef burger was amazing! The toppings went perfectly with the burger and the homemade sauces were a great addition. I can't wait to try the bison or elk burgers. It's all wild, organic and local (minus the kangaroo and camel)."}
{"text":"If you are looking to try new food, this a great little place. They have a large array of unusual meat burgers. Prices are fairly high ($12-$16 for a burger and $6-$8 for sides), but you are getting a delicious, unusual, gourmet burger.   I tried the middle eastern camel burger with deep fried pickles. The burger was a little messy as the meat crumbled a lot, but the flavours all worked well together. It was my first time trying camel and I would describe it as sort of a lamb/beef taste. They also bring you a number of their homemade sauces to try out. We used them for dipping our sides.   The restaurant reminded me of a cozy cabin. It worked well with the theme.   I had a hard time deciding what to try, so I think I'll need to go back to try a few more!"}
{"text":"Burger was good. Service so so. Server yelled back and forth to a customer rather than going to the table to talk in a normal voice. Same server wiped her nose on her plaid shirt. YUCK.  Will never be back."}
{"text":"So I'm a little torn about this place, maybe because I was just looking for a simple tasty burger and this place wasn't it. Their menu is pretty exotic, with burgers ranging from rabbit, ostritch, camel and kangaroo. I kept it simple and had the wild burger with berry sauce. It was alright, I found it a bit bland. Their poutine was good, slightly salty (but secretly I like that) and the ketchup was great and had 'real' taste to it. I wasn't blown away by this place though. Will I be back? Probably not, they are not as close to me and I really do just like burgers simple."}
{"text":"Was looking around the neighbourhood for a  place to get a good burger, and was not disappointed. They have burgers that nobody else has in the city. Not just what the can go on the burger but the patties go from lentils, salt cod, beef, duck, kangaroo and camel. Where else can you get that many options? This place does not have some value meal deal for $5. Time, thought, and ingredients have gone into each burger. Guess what you might have to pay for that. Burger fries and a beer, yes they are licensed, will be about $20+tax.  They have house made condiments that come out with every burger. Sundries tomato, blackberry chutney, and a salsa verde. We found the salsa verde was the best of them.  Will be back to try all the interesting burgers."}
{"text":"Awful, just awful.   We ordered the salmon burger, bison burger, duck fat garlic fries and  wild onion rings.   Let's start with the service, okay, but it took over 30 minutes for the order to come! Burgers were simply awful, there was barely any meat whatsoever, tasteless, look-warm and was all floppy and wet. Both burgers had a weird vinegary taste to them! The remainder of the ingredients were minimal and tasteless. It was like they were cooked from frozen and not properly too!   We were looking forward to our sides at least....garlic fries weren't garlic, weren't crispy whatsoever and tasted stale. The onion rings were frozen tasteless certainly not wild as the name implies...unless it implies a dead carcass in the wild for weeks!  Best of all it was an absolute rip off. I could not recommend to avoid this place at all costs more."}
{"text":"Smokey restaurant because it connects with the casino inside of the Wildfire. In addition, it is weird that you have to order before sitting down and they pour your drinks or beer at the cash register. They are running it like a fast food place, but it should be set up as a restaurant. It is just weird. The food was very mediocre, pretty standard burgers. I had the Cajun Turkey, boyfriend had the Wildfire burger...nothing special. The prices are reasonable and the   ladies working there were nice. Maybe they have a good breakfast menu? They had several TVs showing several basketball games, so that was some of its appeal.  The burger prices range between $7-$10 including side of fires, onion rings, or cole slaw."}
{"text":"In a burger mood, I'd been hearing a lot about Wild Burger, but had not seen it. I'm in Whitby every weekend, how did I NOT know where this place was?! Tucked in the Landmark Theatre Complex on Consumers Drive, there it was. It's across from Glow in the Dark Mini Putt and beside Mongolian Grill.   A rustic place; very clean with a cowboy feel. We are seated and took a gander at the menu. So many choices plus specials! Our server was super cheerful and a huge fan of the restaurant, not just because she works there. These are not your run of the mill burgers, these are gourmet. The combinations are incredible. Amazing spices, aiolis, chutneys, fried eggs, syrups, cheeses and veggies are just some of the toppings for their meats.    Feeling like trying something new? This is the place to do it! Have you ever tried Elk, Kangaroo, Camel or Ostrich? They offer this and more with the most incredible combinations of toppings; you cannot resist. Not up for something new? They do have Chicken, Beef, Crab and more. Either way, this chef knows what they're doing!   My Mom went with the Special, a Bison Burger wrapped in bacon and stuffed with Nutella. I love duck, a lot, so I chose the Miso Duck Burger($15). The bison burger was super thick and juicy, difficult to eat at first. I'd never had Nutella in a burger before, but she said it was really subtle, not like eating a spoonful. All in all a great combination of sweet and salty. My duck burger was not what I expected; it didn't look or taste like duck I'm used to, but it was still delicious. The wild mushrooms, onions and spiced cabbage went perfectly. The wasabi vinaigrette made randomly spicy appearances. These were pretty tasty burgers. Three sauces were served with the burgers, but everything was so flavourful, we didn't use them. We shared an order of Deep Fried Pickles. SO GOOD! Crispy and coated in a light, tasty batter.  We tried dipping the pickles in the sauces, but the pickles overpowered them. I'm glad we each didn't get a side, definitely couldn't have finished!   Service was awesome. She was so enthusiastic about the menu, it was almost contagious. She answered all questions and we chatted a bit after the meal as well about their unique menu."}
{"text":"The concept is cool, and if you're into wild game, then you'll be glad you came here. There's a good selection of seafood and gamey meats.   I got the beef burger and wasn't a fan. I'm spoiled by the likes of the Holy Chuck and Burger Priest, though, so I'm not sure how much my opinion matters. I didn't like the burger. That's not why you come here, though. Give it a try if you're adventurous!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the wide selections of meat burgers here. Awesome concept and definitely very interesting to try. Tried the ostrich burger while my boyfriend had the camel burger. Tried both burgers and the ostrich meat was very distinct. Tried it for the very first time and was impressed. It came with some fresh veggies, fried egg, and cheese. Really delicious and fresh.  The camel burger was also good. I think in terms of meat, the camel was more tasty and juicy. The burger was a little sweet and had a great texture and flavours. Really enjoyed that one.  The duck fat fries were great. Not greasy at all and not salty. You get to dip them in homemade sauces.   Servings are great. Portions are big and the food comes in a wooden food platter...which makes it look so fancy. Presentation is always key for me, and I love looking at beautiful food presentations. It makes the experience more worthwhile.  Pretty pricey but this is gourmet burger and their meat are from canada, no antibiotics and local. We got a deal from dealathons. $18 for $30 worth of food.  This is actually a pretty good deal because a lot of the food in the menu are expensive.   Very good overall. Like the  vibe and food"}
{"text":"I like to start by saying I haven't seen too many places to specialize in game meat but they still have main type like beef and chicken.   So they had speciality burger for the burger route. I had wild boar burger that was filled with nutella and wrapped it bacon. At first that seem they doesn't sound good but it was delicious and filling. I had the onion rings with it. They were alright.   This place has burgers you won't see else where but I like it. I had elk, bison, boar before. They had camel and kangaroo which I haven't seen. Rabit and vension are kind of out of norm but I like the range. I know I will be back.  There was a bit of wait and they have low ceiling in basement but it look like it was an converted house."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to their boneless wings. The honey garlic wings plus sweet potato fries beckon to me every Wednesday. Less than a mile away from home, we visit this place constantly. The homemade Ding Dong dessert is delicious, and every time I've had a burger, its been cooked to perfection. Priced moderately.  One con: the restaurant is a little smoky at times, as its in a casino and adjacent to the sports book. While watching Michigan basketball the other night on one of the big screens sprinkled throughout the restaurant seating area, I shot eye daggers at the lad loudly talking and puffing on his cigarette in the sports book. Then I thought, \"Eh, I AM in a casino\" and went back to polishing off my burger.  Service is OK, usually a little slow as it seems that the cashier also acts as a server sometimes. Definitely not a top notch romantic place but if you want an alternative for Buffalo Wild Wings and with better wings, this can be your spot."}
{"text":"I am disappointed that this restaurant is closed.  I have eaten there and had hoped to try every burger on the menu.  They also served my favourite beer.  I would give a 5 star but They closed to soon."}
{"text":"Wild Burger is definitely not your typical burger joint.  Very nice atmosphere, friendly service, great food presentation and quality.  Very much a 'gourmet' burger restaurant.  However, for me it's not the type of burger I'm looking for, and really, the food was not very good...  I started with the Scotch Egg which was excellent, so we were off to a good start.  Then the sauces come out in preparation for your burger, and also for dipping fries/onion rings.  The sauces are in very nice containers, pretty presentation.  So burgers arrive and they look awesome.  I had the beef burger (there are at least a dozen other meat/fish types to choose from).  I added bacon, egg, chipotle mayo, ketchup and mustard.  The burger itself included jalape√±o havarti cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion ring, lime/cilantro sauce.  You would think a burger of this magnitude was going to be great.  However that was not the case, if anything it was relatively tasteless, except for the odd aftertaste.  There was also a peculiar mushy texture I kept tasting in the burger, as if someone put a layer of refried beans in there or something.  Not happy...  Then there were the fries and onion rings.  Both cooked in duck fat.  I'm guessing the strange aftertaste was the duck fat as I tasted it heavily in the onion rings.  Tasted it a bit in the fries as well.  Overall it's a nice place and is worth a try; maybe you'll have better luck with a different burger.  For me everything was great except for the food, so I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Really impressive burger selection, and while they don't hold together all too well, they taste great and are beyond fresh.  Every Torontonian foodie needs to eat each of their burgers and join their members club that will be taking members to farms, vinyards and do other things that will connect people with food."}
{"text":"Showed up Sunday for a quick dinner. Our first sign should have been the empty restaurant. Nevertheless we went in. We ordered the duck and bison burger with an order of sweet potato fries and 2 drinks for a total price of $40. A little bit of a shock but we figured this might be the best burger of our lives, unfortunately that was not the case. The patties were tiny, the friend onions were burnt and the buns were stale. The sweet potato fries (well the 15 chips we got) were sub par. I would normally be hesistant to criticize a restaurant that is conscious of where their food comes from, but this is an exception."}
{"text":"I am probably being a little unfair with my ratings on this one and that's because i was disappointed. As if the idea of having game meat wasn't enough to get me excited, they had burgers of animals I have never had and never thought of having.  The ambiance they had going on was pretty good and it felt like a place of gathering for hunters, however, the service was terribly slow. Waited about 40 minutes to get our burgers and the place wasn't even full.  We got two burgers: 1) Ostrich burger: I don't know if Ostrich meat is like that or if they cooked it weird, the patty barely had any flavour and the texture felt a lot like powder stuck together. The other toppings on the burger were good so the burger still tasted ok, however, i couldn't get over the texture of the patty.  2) Bison Burger, This was a good burger, almost felt like beef and patty texture was more solid. However, it wasn't good enough for me to want to eat it again, specially if I can eat a much better burger at an orthodox burger joint like The Works or Fresh Burger etc.  That being said, i may give this place another chance to win me back as they do have other burgers which sound really good, like camel, kangaroo, venison etc .."}
{"text":"Delicious. The camel burger was amazing and their duck fat fries are out of this world."}
{"text":"Disappointing. We went there for my son's 7th birthday, three of us. My son loves the Korean chicken but he dislikes spices and wants only cheese and ketchup, so what does that tell you? First off, the set up is silly. There are four-tops all down one side, but right in the center is a big, family-style table that they don't use as family style. It has benches and seats about 12 or 14. We sat there by ourselves and when it got busy, the staff (which was one person at the front of house) had people waiting for a table. They were surprised when we offered to share.  The menu looks great - tons of different game burgers, fish, fowl. Aside from the chicken, we ordered the miso duck burger and the daily special, which sounded like a pork extravaganza. Was supposed to be a pork burger with bacon, pulled pork and other goodies. It was dry - imagine all that pork fat and it's dry. It should have been dripping with pulled pork but it looked just like a medium sized burger. Presentation was boring - wasn't an open bun with pork everywhere, just a flattish burger with little flavor. The miso duck burger was too finely ground. It had a mushy mouth feel, no detectable taste of miso, three little strips of limp cabbage that was supposed to be pickled, and no discernable sauce. The fries are duck fat garlic fries according to the menu, and they were tasty but no garlic to speak of. The sticky toffee pudding was delicious but likely microwaved, and the funnel cake fries were greasy, but again they made my 7 yr old happy. Lots of good beers including local Brock Street on tap. The diet coke was flat. It turned out they had coke zero and knew there were problems with the diet tap. The coke zero was fine, so there's that.  When the server asked during the meal what I thought of the duck, I told her but I ate it and didn't expect anything in consideration. I hadn't been a dick about it - just said it could be any sort of meat, lacking in both duck and miso flavor.  When she brought the bill, she had taken half the cost of the duck burger off, which we appreciated. At that point, I told her as kindly as I could, making it clear we weren't looking for a discount but thought they might want the feedback, that the pork special was dry. She informed us that everybody else loved it. So, good for them I guess.  It ain't cheap, either. Burgers up to about $16 and that's a la carte. Fries are extra. We had three burgers, two orders of fries, one draft beer, two soft drinks and two desserts. With half off the duck burger, bill was about $70. Remember, we're talking about burgers here.  Won't go back. Shame because the menu makes the burgers sound fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is closed now. I never even had a chance to try it. But it's closed; newspapers on all the windows - darn."}
{"text":"If you like tasty meats in your burgers, this place is for you (and me). Juicy, big burgers dressed to the nines. Toppings are chosen for you, so decisions to make. Fries are big and crispy, onion rings are also delish, but it's the deep fried pickles you should write home about ... Out of this world!"}
{"text":"I love this place. People are quick to judge because this place has been here for awhile, but I am here telling you this is the best burger in Henderson. I've been to all Wildburger establishments and this one has been consistently the best. Don't get me wrong, all of them are good, but this one is the best in all of the top categories. 1)Service Service here is great. The gals upfront always have a smile and are extremely courteous and friendly. The General Manager has been known to pop his head in and truly seems interested to know about how our food is. 2)Food I've had the classic wildburger and I've had the boneless wings and I can safely say that the burger is top notice. The bun holds up well, nice and quality. The burger itself is always cooked exactly how I want it. The slaw the burger comes with is amazing. It really ties the whole burger together. The onion strings are the best, the presentation is awesome. Little fry baskets?! Genius! Always golden brown and delicious.  3)Atmosphere  The ambience here is what you would expect from any stations property. Well maintained and clean. No smoking in the restaurant, so it's nice to be able to breathe. Flat screens galore, if you want them to change the channel the server will be more than happy to do so.  Bottom line: if you want a high quality burger, this is your place. Fast, friendly service. Ten thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Burgers are ok but customer service is pretty bad due to rude staff.  Better off at Granite brewery down the street."}
{"text":"Having moved to Toronto after a decade in NYC, I have to say I have been desperate to find a good burger joint. In a gastro-landscape overwhelmed by fast-food and chains, Wild Burger has been like a blessing.  Everything is locally sourced or wild and you can taste the freshness in every bite. The seasoning is sharp and distinct for each burger, which is why I highly recommend trying each one. I can't say I have a favorite burger there, but I definitely have a favorite new burger joint.  PRO TIP: Try to go there on a night the super-friendly owner and chef, Suman is around for some extra insight into the recipes and evolution of each burger."}
{"text":"Are you ready for a different burger experience. This place is it. My wife and i came in looking for a burger. We ordered the Canadian Burger (special feature for Canada Day). This thing had everything including kettle chips on it! We also ordered the nachos, once again very different but fun and yummy. Service was good and fast and the waitress was very friendly (didn't get her name) kitchen was abit slow considering only 6 guests total but it was worth the wait! Food was 5 stars but the kitchen being slow caused the lower rating."}
{"text":"WIld Burger is Station Casino's newest gimmick to get people in the door of their Wildfire properties. The billboards and ad blitz worked, I decided to give them a try.   Basically WIldfire ripped out the small cafe they used to have and put in Wild Burger. When you walk up the small ramp to the restaurant you are met by someone who will say Hi and then explains their menu and tells you how to order. You place your order and pay on the spot. I look over the menu and tell her I want a wild burger. She then asked how I wanted it cooked and I say medium well. (Don't laugh, there's a backstory on why I like my meat cooked medium well unless I know the meat's source). I add an order of onion strips and a drink and hand over my debit card. I ask if they swipe players cards but she says no. That's dumb, guess they don't care how much money I spend with them. Then I get handed the receipt to sign. It has a place for a tip. If you don't have cash to leave and have no clue how the service is going to be how do you know how much to tip? I scribble down some numbers, grab my drink glass and off I go.   The place is clean, not too bright, but it's got a ton of flat screens. And while some of the TV's look great, a few have some image quality issues. My fountain drink is also kind of flat. Yep, fountain drink hell strikes again. It's better than nothing so I grab a seat and wait for my food. Since the food is made to order I temper my expectations on timing and I get my food fairly quickly.   What arrived was a pretty stacked hamburger that did leave a good visual impression. I snapped a picture of it and the onion strips sill in their little metal fry basket. I check out the condiments, I've got A1, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco, Grey Poupon, and more right there on the table ready to go. I got extra napkins already tableside which will be needed, and so with that it's time to give it a try.   The hamburger was not bad. It was very messy though. You need to use the Guy Fieri double grab holding style to manage it but it was pretty good. They cooked it right, you could taste the meat, the tomatoes were fresh, the onion was there, everything was as it should be. The onion strips were disappointing. They're too thin, and they fall apart when dipped into any sauce. Not impressed with them at all.   Overall, it wasn't bad. Would I go out of my way for it? No. Wild Burger needs to watch and tweak a few things. The concept is good, but this place is not quite ready for primetime just yet. Also hearing the staff gripe about the place or talk about their personal lives in explicit detail isn't too cool either. One last thing. This place DESPERATELY NEEDS WET WIPES or those little cleaning cloth packets so you can clean your hands."}
{"text":"We had take out burgers last night and they were so bad, they looked good but they were plastered with bread crumbs which made for a very awful slimy texture.  The deep fried pickles were clearly from Costco or something in that nature, really bad coating and pickles were too chewy not fresh.  The only good thing were the onion rings which were ok.  We won't order from Wild Burger again. Over $30 for this was definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"Five of us decided to try the new version of Wildfire's attempt to do food right at their casinos.  I have been looking forward to the opening and wondering what they will put on the menu besides \"burgers\" and since they tout \"pick your meat\" what exactly the selections would be.  Oddly I am not a fan of beef, so why a burger joint? If I eat beef I prefer a good burger so anticipation was high.  And tbh I was looking forward to see if they would venture and offer bison, or some exotic meats.  First glance at the menu reveals beef, turkey and veggie burgers.  Well, ok.... a selection but not much beyond what you can find anywhere else.  Between the five of us we order five different things, so good opportunity to sample.  The food came along in fairly short order considering there were five or six tables that all came in at once.  The Turkey burger was good, stacked well with toppings just like I asked for.  I ordered the coleslaw which had to much mayonaise for me and was a mess.  My wife ordered a burger so I got to taste that.  It was a generous size, with a good amount of toppings as well,  The fries were thin cut and in a little metal basket.  Cute.  The fries were good but I think they should offer thick fries as an alternative.    While the burgers were good, there was not much flavor to them other than beef, not much seasoning there so that could be both good and bad depending on your preferences.  One person in our party ordered breakfast, and he likes eggs with the whites cooked thoroughly but the yokes still somewhat soft.  They missed the mark on this one.  But they made up for that a little with their home fries, they were pretty good.  However that said the home fries would be better if they added onions and maybe bell peppers, and for me, lots of garlic.  That should be an option.  We also ordered chicken wings with the Honey Mustard Garlic sauce.  Wings are wings and hard to change them up, but I must admit I did like the sauce.  And speaking of sauces, they offered a variety all of which were good.  I was a little disappointed in the garlic and ketchup sauce tho, it tasted just like ketchup.  They need to work on this one a little.  Overall the food was good, a bit spendy but good.  I would like to see a few more appetizers on the menu for a variety like quesadillas (do them right if you add them Wildfire!).  We go to this casino on occassion and watch a game, it would be nice to have an appetizer selection for bar food or if sitting at the sports book."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and such exotic meats to try! I recommend sitting in because the burgers are really tall so it's kind of messy because there's grease and stuff falling out of the burgers. They also have sauces that compliment the burgers really well.  I had the Elk burger with the egg yolk. And I also tried the bison and rabbit burgers. They all have very subtle differences but also all come with different toppings. They also have camel and kangaroo burgers but I heard they weren't that great maybe because of how exotic they are.  I would try this place again because of the unique meat choices and they're pretty good burgers. I think this place is underrated.  It was empty when I went, so the service was really fast."}
{"text":"Last week, my manager and I were having a conversation. He had mentioned bison. I indicated that when I was living in Winnipeg, MTS had some cool commercials with talking bison characters.   I then thought about having a bison burger. Yes, it's not the best transition, but I ended up craving one.   My boss didn't help. He started looking up where I could get a bison burger. Most are within Toronto. Wild Burger appeared in his search. It said that I was 34 minutes away from my home by car.   Last Saturday, I did some outlet shopping in Ajax, and then drove over to Wild Burger for a late lunch at 3 pm. The restaurant is a part of a large plaza with Landmark Cinema and a sports complex.   There is plenty of parking. I parked and went into the restaurant. It feels Canadian with all the wood. Even the server was eating a red black lumberjack shirt.   The left side of the restaurant lists the types of game burgers you can have on the chalkboards. There is a lot of choice, including ostrich and camel burgers! I got to choose where I wanted to sit.   I still had a hankering for a bison burger. I ordered the chipotle bison burger, which came with small chunks of pineapple and red pepper salsa. I normally don't like warm pineapple, but this salsa was awesome!  The burger is on the pricy side at $15. I ordered a side of duck fat garlic fries for $7. I am not a huge fries person, but these fries were delicious. Duck fat rules! The garlic didn't hit me at first, probably because the bison burger was so flavourful. However, half an hour after my meal, I could taste it! No complains. No vampires.   The server was friendly and helpful. She told me that they had run out of elk and chili. When I am back there, I will try the scotch egg (my all-time favourite pub item) and the chili.   The dessert looked good. Sadly, my stomach didn't have room for it. Next time!  (212)"}
{"text":"Went back for a birthday! We got lost in the wild.........menu. With so many of us, it gave me an opportunity to see and try out a bunch of stuff.   We tried the miso duck burger, the Austin Kangaroo burger, spicy burger, elk burger, the wild poutine, and the funnel cake fries. In addition, they have three local beers on tap: old flame (from Port Perry I believe), Brock street (Whitby), and their own in-house wild brew. Didn't have a chance to try the last one but the other two certainly hit the spot with our feast.   The burgers all shine with their own distinct personalities. Zero complaints on the different ones so you're safe to order any of them. Great preparation and excellent flavours.  The poutine is medium in size, but couldn't sustain 5 boys. If you're thinking of just ordering this to split, only do so if you have less than 3 in your party. The gravy is made in-house and you can definitely taste the difference.   For dessert, we had the funnel cake fries. Fair warning, these are essentially mini churros. Good, but not quite what we were expecting. If we chose to add ice cream on top for an additional $2, I have no doubt in my mind it would have elevated it. Mental note for next time.   Service was once again, stellar. Will be back again to knock out the rest of these burgers; if you complete the checklist for the burgers, you win a free dinner for two and a birthday voucher.......... challenge accepted."}
{"text":"I really like this place!  The menu is interesting even if you aren't into wild game burgers.  The chicken sandwich was fantastic.  I also recommend the crab cake burger.  There are specials nearly every day.  You must check it out!"}
{"text":"Let me start off with that I am a huge fan of build your own burger joints and this place isn't bad, but it's just not that great. I have been a few times since they opened to give them a chance to work out any issues in the kitchen and in the service.   Overall the ingridients used in the burger are top quality and I am a huge fan of the onion strings as they taste both delicious as a topping and as a side. However, when you begin to build your burger, mind you it will get messy when you eat it, so do not go here on a first date or for a business meeting as you will look like a savage when your done with your meal. Or at least I did :)  My one knock against this place is the way they cook their meat. I prefer my burgers cooked to a medium-rare to medium range and while I know this is not Morton's steakhouse or the Burger Bar, they do ask you how you want your burger cooked. And every time, it looks and tastes well done even when I have asked for it to be as rare as possible, like just sear the outside and I want it dripping in blood. But when the staff asks me how my food is and I say the meat is over cooked, they tell me its the lighting in the that restaurant makes it look well done and not their grill cooks in the back. Really now? Really? Do I look that stupid to you? Just apologize and offer to make another or just apologize is all I really want to hear."}
{"text":"Interesting. Flavourful.  Filling. Some of the best burgers in town.  My favourite is the crab and artichoke burger. I'm still waiting to try the kangaroo and camel burgers.  Enough with paying $20 for some overpriced bland burger. Wild burger is my new favourite burger stop."}
