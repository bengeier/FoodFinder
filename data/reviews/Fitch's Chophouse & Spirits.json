{"text":"I went to Fitch's for lunch last week and was very disappointed.  The reastaurant was empty at 12:15 and no one seated us or came out to the door for close to five minutes.  We wondered if it was closed but did see a few people eating.  It was dark - can't read the menu dark and freezing cold.  My salad was so drenched in dressing that I really couldn't eat it (my fault I didn't ask for dressing on the side?).  I give them two stars because fortunately it is no smoking and the waiter was ok."}
{"text":"Had dinner there New Year's Eve and was really disappointed.  We've eaten there before and have been pleased.  But on 12/31/05 something was off, way off.  My dinner (Chicken Oscar) came out cold and I found a couple of crab shells.  My partner's dinner (Steak) came out way under-done (Medium Well was requested and we got Rare).  We sent it back to the kitchen and got fresh meals which were done properly  but okay at best.  Service was painfully slow and inattentive and they really didn't seem THAT busy.  We let them know how disappointed we were (verbally that night and in writing thru one of their comment cards) and other than 1 free dessert following dinner, had no response.  We'll have to think twice before going there for dinner again.  It's such a lovely place though and we had a nice time in the bar prior to dinner, so I'll give them an extra star for those efforts."}
{"text":"There's an old adage: never order chicken at a steak house.  

A great space (high ceilings, cute little alcoves with leather sofas) undone by lack luster service and mediocre meals.  Also, somebody will have to explain hosting a large restaurant to me sometime.  Call me naive but when there's a 45 minute for a table yet the dining room seems empty, it looks like somebody screwed up."}
