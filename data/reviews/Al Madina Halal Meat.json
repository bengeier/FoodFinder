{"text":"Found this place four years ago. Omg they have the best biryani and kabob ever invented. Even tho it's a pickup they make best food in comparison to regular restaurant I have been to. The staff is friendly. They make kabob and naan fresh. The seasoning in Their food is to authentic and it taste like Pakistani food. They also have fresh raw meat. I recommend you to pay them a visit you won't regret. The prices are so cheap. The portions size are great. They basically make sure the take out box is full. I have being in love with this place forever. It's very convenient for summer times to come out from wonderland and get there so let's be honest food is way too expensive at wonderland."}
{"text":"Great take out food. Their seekh kebab roll and fried fish are my favourites. Not too spicy but the right amount of flavour. Have also used them for catering a party and guests loved the food. Sometimes service is slow and not on time but I keep going back cause the food is good and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Chicken biriyani for $4.99, I was skeptical, but was blown away after tasting. Literally just walked in and bought a container to try with a curry before heading out to Vaughan Mills.   Tons of flavour in this biriyani, cooked perfectly! Butter chicken curry was very good as well."}
{"text":"They have a pretty good chicken biryani for $4.99, and a variety of other Pakistani foods.  There is a bakery in the same location as well, which sells pastries, cake, and samosas."}
