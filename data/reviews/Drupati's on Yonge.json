{"text":"Got bone in chicken  combo.  Was good not to hot.  Hot sause on the side to spice it up.  The doubles are thr best I've had tho awesome.   Place is new and clean."}
{"text":"So glad this place popped up in our neighbourhood! The food is delicious, and they have amazing specials. Great value, the rotis are huge and delicious! Our new go-to place for quick and delicious takeout."}
{"text":"I have tried many different restaurants and no other compares to this one. The food is so full of flavour that I always over eat and wobble home. The doubles are addictive, and the Aloo Pie, (curry potato in deep-fried doh) is so perfect I can be satisfied with just that, but add the Chana, or the filling of the Doubles and you are now in heaven. Thanks to Drupati's my stove really misses me and wishes I could come back, but who would want to with such great food being made for me. I can never recreate what they do as they are amazing chefs. Must be mom in the back, or at least Mom taught them so very well."}
{"text":"It has been a very long time since I found a restaurant that served doubles. The last time I had doubles was at a restaurant in Scarborough and it was mind blowing but that was then and this is now. The atmosphere was nice, there are a lot of young business minded individuals. The staff was pleasant and the food was delicious. I'm so excited I cannot wait to visit again and bring all my friends."}
{"text":"It's awesome to find a Trini restaurant in this area and somewhat near to the subway.

On to the review..

1. Doubles - really good! Just like it tastes in the island. Definitely worth trying if you haven't before. I usually get it with a little bit of pepper.

2. Aloo pie and saheena - Both pretty good as well. Don't bother getting chick peas on the aloo pie. Total ruins it in my opinion.

3. Bake and Shark - Hit and miss. Thing is, it's very difficult to get it in Canada so worth trying out. Not as good as the one on the beach but still tasty.

4. Veggie roti - Really good. I like getting pumpkin, okra and mango especially with paratha roti. It's super delicious. 

Negatives - 

Sometimes the music is too loud. Maybe some like it but I find it unnecessary if the food itself is good.

Also, they need a better variety of drinks. Didn't seem to be much in the way of juices when I went.

___

Overall, not the most healthy food. You probably don't want to eat it every day but once in a while it's well worth trying."}
{"text":"Their pepper sauce is lethal, the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Great addition to a neighbourhood that has little to offer for quick, inexpensive casual meals except sushi places. The doubles are out of sight."}
{"text":"Literally just made a yelp account to comment on this place. The staff wasn't even present - place was totally vacant. When they actually appeared they served me a boneless chicken roti. It was so dry and cold.I literally took a few bites and stopped because it was so disgusting
Would definitely NOT recommend."}
{"text":"I decided to go in after tasting samples of \"doubles\" that they were handing out.  The doubles were amazing! I would suggest not adding hot sauce to them as it covers up that delicious sweet flavor. I also tried their chicken roti and goat roti. I ordered the mini size which is quite big ! It was very flavorful and authentic tasting. Please beware that their homemade hot sauce is quite hot . It's a new restaurant so it was modern and clean. Staff is also friendly. Their prices are amazing. They have a breakfast buffet available which is about $11 I believe.. I have not tried it but I get the feeling it would be great."}
{"text":"I am blown away by the prices! A family of 4 could eat here, be stuffed, and have left overs for 20$. I enjoy their rotis, but I really love their Doubles and Aloo pies! The staff are always super friendly as well and service is speedy. I really enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"The food is okay - around 3 stars but the delivery and service is -3 stars.  However least I could give them here is 1!

My order was delivered 1 hour late (ie 1hr 45 min delivery time instead of the promised 45 min.) and half the order was missing.  Got one Roti instead of the 2 we ordered.  

Re the food - I had the boneless chicken Roti and they clearly cook the chicken separately from the potato filling, with no spices and in big chunks instead of little morsels.  This means that the Roti is very inconsistent.  Bite into potatoes and you get a nice soft spicy mouthful but bite into chicken and its dry and bland."}
{"text":"I love Caribbean food; it's hearty and fills you like a mom-cooked meal. 

But I'll be honest; I have an addiction for jerk chicken and anything related.

I started a job down the street and Drupati's was one top of the list for Caribbean cuisine. Growing up in the west and familiar with popular \"jerk joints\", Drupati was a must. This establishment is clean and modern.

I ordered the Stewed Chicken lunch special ($5.49) and a double ($2). Food is prepared right in front of you and served in a pay-n-pickup fashion. Lunch portions are half portions.

The Stewed Chicken was on par with what you would expect - spicy, salty with a touch of sweet. What I disliked was being served only the drum portion and not the thigh. The bed of rice and peas served as a compliment to the chicken gravy.

You may be confused if this was your first time visiting. The cashier will ask whether you'd like a \"Double\". No, it's not double portions. It's a roti wrapped filled with saucy chick peas. I enjoyed it.

Please be wary of the excessive wait when ordering during lunch hours. Drupati is understaffed and have an inefficient ordering system. My order time was 20 minutes. You'be been warned."}
{"text":"Tried the doubles and they were pretty great and great value too. Place is very nice, just needs some good trini music =D very happy to have a trinidadian place down town! Want to try the chowmein and fried rice. Anyone who has had it before please let me know!"}
{"text":"Came in with a lot of hype, but sadly left disappointed. I had the boneless chicken roti combo and it was nothing special. The small amount of chicken that was there was dry and the curry had very little flavour to it. The roti wasn't particularly warm either. The portion was a good size and the price was ok but honestly there are better alternatives in the area. All in all I'm very disappointed after reading so many good things about this place."}
{"text":"I was excited when my husband spotted this restaurant because I love Trini food. I visited Trinidad back in 2007 and the food was amazing. I know there are a lot of good Trini spots outside of the core but I hadn't been able to find one inside the city proper. I don't know what they put in Trini food but mmmmmmmmmm! I love tamarind, cilantro, cumin, and a bit of spice, so maybe that's what they are putting in there.

If you're unfamiliar with Trini food I would order a double (chickpeas wrapped in fried dough) for each person and either a roti or the bake & shark (fried dough with fried shark and some veggies). They'll ask you if you want some pepper -- say yes! It's spicy but flavourful. I suppose if you're nervous about spicy food you can get it on the side. I remember pholourie (fried flour dipped in tamarind sauce) being good as well, but I haven't tried it at this location. My husband had the jerk chicken and said it was okay, but wished he had ordered more doubles instead.

If you look up Drupati's on Yelp you'll see the other locations are fairly popular."}
{"text":"Outside, they have a sign listing all the specials available starting at $5.49, but only the bone-in chicken roti is available at that price, and the rest of the items on that list increase in price from their.

The bone-in goat roti was good, with lots of sauce. The \"medium\" doubles are very very spicy. They got pretty busy during the Friday lunch rush, as it seems pretty popular with office workers nearby.

No WiFi offered to public despite network of same name. Prices in general seem quite affordable."}
{"text":"I love how you can get a roti with paratha and not just the standard dahlpuri! I got veggie with baigan choka and it was the best I've ever tasted, perfectly soft and just fantastically seasoned, a delight, AND the eggplant was perfectly distributed throughout the wrap. My fave Trini place in Toronto and that's really saying a lot!"}
{"text":"No staff here to take your order in middle of the day! Who leaves their restaurant unattended? I found a lot of bars in this area have literally no staff for the lunch rush.  Hire better staff!!"}
{"text":"This was probably the worst experience I've had waiting for food. Placed an order, guy said 20 minutes. Didn't get the food until an hour later. Brutal."}
