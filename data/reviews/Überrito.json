{"text":"Finally tried this place tonight as it is all of my favorite things but I was so disappointed. Came in at 7:30 on a Saturday night and it was completely dead and there were only teenagers working. When someone finally helped me, he was quite unhelpful. He didn't explain how their process works, clarify what the options are, or even really ask what I wanted. The food looked like it hadn't been touched in quite some time and most items were congealed on top. Yuck. Then when it came time to pay, I used a coupon for a free burrito bowl from signing up for their loyalty program. The young man didn't know how the coupon worked so I had to wait for the young woman to finish assembling another customer's food so she could ring me up. The food was pretty awful and I definitely could make better at home. I barely ate any of it before deciding it wasn't worth continuing. At least it was free -- I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I really like the \"build your own\" concept of Chipotle, but they are really big on cilantro, of which I am NOT a fan. This place lets you choose between cilantro rice and mexican rice, and their meat (I had a chicken bowl) was nicely seasoned--not too salty or spicy. They have a ton of toppings to choose from, including at least 6 different salsas ranging from hot to mild. The possibilities are endless! They offer a choice between a regular or mini size bowl--I got the regular and couldn't finish it all. Also, for an additional $2.99 you can add a drink and a cookie. Not a bad deal as the cookie was about as big as my face, and yummy too!"}
{"text":"I am a usual customer of this place because of not only the food, but the employees. They're always incredibly attentive and friendly. They have SO many options from their meats to their salsas you will not be disappointed. They also give the suggested amount of an item first (obviously) but if you want more they have no issue hookin it up FAT (unless of course it's an upcharge item and if you ask using manners). The set up is standard burrito and type but I love the design of the place, very casual and classy and very uplifting. I won't go anywhere else for my burritos!"}
{"text":"I LOVE UBERRITO!!! My husband and I found this place a couple weeks ago and have been here almost every day since. The food is fresh and I have loved everything I have ordered. There is no wrong choice here!! I would highly recommend Uberrito to anyone but also like that it's a hidden gem that isn't overly busy and the service is GREAT!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was average and service was horrible. It was my first time there and the girl serving rolled her eyes and was iterated when I asked her to repeat herself. I told her to be patient with us since it was our first time. But she still seemed irritated. We won't go be going back. Chipotle has better food and service."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place; and on my first visit I was disappointed. Slightly different options than Chipotle but really the extras here are spinach and maybe a special dressing? If you're looking for an upgrade to Chipotle, this isn't it.  They get 3 stars because the food was good in its own right. But it won't make you crave it..."}
{"text":"Terrible! My boyfriend and I got food poisoning from here! Thankfully we got the meal for free by signing up for their rewards program.. staff was not friendly either. Chipotle will always be #1"}
{"text":"After driving by for two months, I finally stopped in for lunch. I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly the staff was & how clean the restaurant is. We went for taco Tuesday yesterday. I don't eat red meat or pork. When I saw the Tree Hugger taco on the menu, I was in heaven! It was amazing! I went back for lunch today, Wednesday. I would have given 5 stars, but after reading other reviews and learning about the loyalty card & double points Wednesday's, I'm disappointed no one offered or explained this to me. My husband just took my son there for dinner as well. Regardless, I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place. A concept similar to chipotle but with way more options. They have quiet a few protein options including fish and shrimp and tons of toppings including around 8 different salsas. You can do a few different wraps, burritos, tacos, bowls or salads. It's a fast casual concept with a nice and quiet ambiance. It is very clean with modern decor. The staff is always friendly and the food is always good. If you want to try something new I definitely recommend such that you can go in and get good service, good food, clean establishment, no wait, with a modern twist- can't ask for much more than that can you?"}
{"text":"Better than chipotle found a new spot, they need more throughout the valley. Certainly will come back for more."}
{"text":"I asked for steak in my bowl and the guy only gave me 5 pieces. YES. 5 pieces of tiny little chunks. I was shocked and asked for more meat. Alright then, he gave me 2 more pieces. WTH!?"}
{"text":"Been here twice in three days. Definitely my new favorite. A unique mix of Chipotle and Rubio's but fresher than both and without the \"chain\" feel. Great variety of flavors and toppings on the create-your-own. All of the staff have been super helpful and attentive. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is so much better than Chipotle!  This is my first time here. I ordered a fried cod burrito. Delicious! Staff was really pleasant as well."}
{"text":"Ok... so im a die hard chipotle fan, i even worked there lol, anyways, i was a little skeptical when my friend told me about this place at first, he said it was fresher and tastes better, and all this. Well when i walked in, extremely clean, smelled amazing, and the staff was on point with the portions and everything. Like i said im a die hard Chipotle fan but i would never turn a trip to Uberrito lol"}
{"text":"Excited about having good quality, made to order Mexican burritos and bowls at Tatum & Shea.  The shrimp is cooked to perfection when you place your order.  The shredded pork is flavor-able.  Today I had a grilled chicken bowl. The restaurant is very clean and has modern decor. There are tables and chairs outside too."}
{"text":"Chipotle has nothing on this place! It is a build your own burrito at the counter style place, but with so many more options. Tons of different meats and salsa to choose from. The spicy avocado salsa is amazing! And the nachos. Man those nachos! Ask for a frequent buyers card so you can get discounts. I was very impressed with the service as well. They were very friendly and seemed to enjoy their job, which you typically don't see in fast food style places like this.  And lastly, prices are reasonable and portion sizes are generous. I could not finish my burrito bowl in one setting. Leftover were just as good!"}
{"text":"$5 Burrito deal us great!! Good flavors and many options. Burritos are huge!! Fish tacos are great! I did not care for the cheesy fried chicken taco but I am not a fan of bland queso.    Employees seemed unhappy and disorganized. Glass doors, sneeze guard & tables were dirty!  It's a cute concept! Location is great! Prices are fair. And it's a nice diversion from Chipolte.   I would go back for their $5 deal!"}
{"text":"This place is like chipotle only not overly salted or seasoned. I got the chicken burrito on $5 burrito Monday.  Just like chipotle, they have that line of options, only they have a ton more options like saut√©ed spinach with garlic, mushrooms, cotija cheese and many more. The burrito was so large I could barely finish half of it. Next time, I'll have to get the mini size. Great fast food alternative."}
{"text":"I probably should give 4 stars but here's why I did 3. I've been here several times. The staff is very friendly. Somethings are average but good and some are slightly better than average like the sloppy cowboy taco and the avocado salsa. I have had one major issue. Two times I ordered the Serrano chicken taco (fried chicken taco) and both times it tasted overwhelmingly strong of fish which they also have fried options for. It's clear they use the same oil for both. I am allergic to fish and don't even like the taste of it. Other than that... Pretty good lunch spot."}
{"text":"I just wasn't a fan. Overpriced. Very small amount of protein. Luckily my husband liked his bowl."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is delicious, some are out of this world. I have tried their bowls, burritos and tacos several different ways. This place has the tastiest fresh Mex anywhere. I just wish there were more stores throughout the valley. I have tried 4 different tacos and they are all tasty. my most favorite taco is their fish taco.  I have been to this store and the one in Arcadia, taste and consistency is the same.  You guys have done a great job."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! The food here is so fresh and delicious, and they give you so much of it! The burritos are MONSTROUS! The bowls are GIGANTIC! Always takes me a few hours to finish eating my order. How can you go wrong?!"}
{"text":"OMG... YUMMMMYYYY!!!! I stumbled across Uberrito today looking for a new lunch place by my office. What serendipity! I ordered three tacos (didn't realize how big they would be). I got the Sloppy Cowboy. This was my least favorite because it was pretty spicy and I'm pretty wimpy but it was nonetheless tasty. Next was the Forked Pork. Delicious, but still not my fave... The best by a long shot, which surprised me because I love my protiens and meats, was the Tree Hugger! So flavorful I wish I would have had room to eat three more. The veggies are crunchy and the garlic aioli sauce was mouth-watering. The staff is absolutely delightful and helpful. They signed me up for the loyalty card and let me know Wednesdays are double points. I'm already almost halfway to a free burrito or bowl!   All the girls in my office loved it too. The doctor we work for even left to go right over and order his lunch there. I have a feeling this is going to be our Wednesday go to lunch spot!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food at a decent price! The food is very fresh and the dining area is squeaky clean! The best tacos you'll get at a walk in.. Will be back many more times. Would absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great burritos. Much better than Chipotle. If you order something that doesn't come from the make it yourself burrito line expect to wait. It takes forever to get your food."}
{"text":"The decor is really nice and modern. There was literally no one in there right before the dinner rush. The servers behind the counter were friendly and efficient enough.  I liked that they had so many different options for everything. There were a bunch of different salsas (in varying levels of hotness 1-5), tortillas (jalepeno cheddar, spinach, flour, wheat). You can have any of their protein options in a burrito, a bowl, a salad, or for a dollar extra you can have nachos, which they smother in queso.    The queso was pretty awesome. It was perfectly salty, yellow American-cheesey, with tiny pieces of diced jalepeno and fresno pepper for just a touch of spice.   I want to go back and try all of their taco options, especially the Sloppy Cowboy one. I also want to try all of their salsas and many protein options (they even have vegan)."}
{"text":"This place is great...so many options and super good.  Staff is always nice."}
{"text":"It's like chipotle but there isn't a line of 15 people ahead of you. The place is clean, friendly service, decent prices and very good food. I'll be going back and recommend this restaurant to all."}
{"text":"This is one of the best lunch places around. Healthy , inexpensive, really flavorful food."}
{"text":"The U stands for UGLY.  What a mess! Yes, the teenagers were working here at about 8pm on a recent weekend and both of them screwed up royally.  Teenager 1 (female) - tells me that their chicken is white meat. It looks questionable, but took her word and then got home with the food and it was chicken from the dark meat side. She put alot of chicken in the burrito and that made getting out all the nasty pieces nearly impossible. Some chunks looks uncooked as well.  Teenager 2 (male) - overcharged me. It's $2.99 to add drink and cookie, but he rang up each item separate costing me the $1.50 I would have saved. Too much of a hassle on the refund after the card was already charged, so let it go, but bad training, service and a bad burrito made this an unbearable eating experience.   Besides the extra veggies in the bins, the meats were old, nasty and just miserable looking. If you go here, get a veggie burrito to stay safe or turn around and leave to be safer. They focus too much on their ugly little green color scheme  but need to focus on what they serve. Oh, the cookies were decent."}
{"text":"My review is really for 2 and a half stars.   So my boyfriend convinced me to come here last night for an easy dinner. We had a flyer we got in the mail so we figured we would give it a try. Not such a good idea.   The establishment is very clean and modern and some of the staff is friendly. I ordered a shrimp bowl and didn't know that shrimp was one of the proteins that had to be ordered in advance so when I got down the line past the rice and beans option, the gentlemen helping me out told me (he seemed a little frustrated he had to go back to the computer to enter in my order). My boyfriend ordered a bowl as well (I think he chose beef) and got double the meat on his.   Our coupon was for the combo so we got a cookie and a drink with it. The cookies are huge and the best part of our meal. I would definitely go back for a cookie. As for the rest of our food, I'd rather stick to Chipotle. I thought it was nice that they had a shrimp option but I have never seen shrimp so small before. On top of that, you don't get much of it. I think I am being generous with 2 and a half stars considering our stomachs did not handle the food very well last night and not so much today.   Fairly new establishment so I will give it another try (so I have an excuse to get another cookie there)."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place was here until we stumbled upon it today and decided to give it a try. It's similar in concept to Chipotle but with a lot more options. Overall the ingredients seemed very fresh and everything we had was tasty! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Let's get to the meat and potatoes here: Uberrito serves delicious, fresh, flavorful fast Mexican food. Everyone wants to know how it compares to Chipotle, so here it is: better flavored meat, bigger selection of fresh sides (two cheese options! two lettuce options! salsa options for days!), and comparable price. Chipotle's guacamole has the slight edge here, both in flavor and amount, but my fianc√© and I drive past a Chipotle to get Uberrito, and I've been a Chipotle loyalist for years."}
{"text":"Reminds me of Rubio's but better. The food here is spectacular. Everything  is fresh looks fresh and tastes fresh. Service was great and the place was clean but I'm mostly impressed with how delicious the food is. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Got the chance to try this place before it opens. Kind of like Chipotle but with a thousand more options. Different types of tortillas, unique toppings like saut√©ed spinach and mushrooms. Very good and that queso sauce, ohhhhhh brother!"}
{"text":"Mixed reviews... We ordered a chicken bowl, shrimp diablo taco and cheesesteak taco. Bad: the chicken bowl was pretty bland. Not a lot of flavor and the chicken itself was dry. Good: the shrimp diablo taco and the cheesesteak tacos were both very flavorful and packed full of meat. Bad: While we were eating one of the tacos, my friend pulled a loooong hair out of her mouth that was in the taco meat. Now, I know this is a new restaurant and stuff happens...but still...pretty disgusting. Good: The management and workers were very accommodating and refunded our entire purchase as we had lost our appetite. I appreciate this because some other restaurants would not have done this. I don't think we will be back because we were haunted by the hair but overall the food itself was not terrible and the management took care of us."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to this place before definitely try it out. Very friendly when you walk in, and the variety/selection of what they offer is great. Have been about 4 times now and tried different things each time."}
{"text":"Uburrito is my favorite fresh Mexican restaurant in Phoenix now that Baja Fresh is gone.  I like them better than Chipotle, Qudoba or Cafe Rio.  It has the same set up as those other restaurants, they just do it better."}
{"text":"This place blows the doors off any other similar type establishment. I'll take this over Baja fresh or chipotle any day."}
{"text":"Seems as though everyone is comparing Uberrito to Chipotle...maybe in format, but not in food.  Color me NOT a Chipotle fan...(seriously...rice in a burrito?  who does that beside Green Burrito?)  (and, in case you're wondering, yes, the food here is good - fresh, tasty, and a modern take on tacos, etc.)  Uberrito has a hip and cool interior design - points for the decor. The people working there were very friendly and helpful - recognizing (by our puzzled expressions as we looked over the menu board) that we were Ubernoobs, they offered a helpful and concise explanation of the options, along with some personal recommendations.  I went with the first young lady's recommendation of 2 tacos - one Texas Cheesesteak and one Diablo Shrimp.  Both arrived in the basket, and were appealing to look at. They definitely weren't stingy with the toppings.  The Texas Cheesesteak had plenty of beef in it, but a bit too much cilantro for my personal preference.  The Diablo Shrimp taco had plenty of fire (both from the red sauce and from the jalapeno slices).  It also had plenty of shrimp in it.  Good food.  Friendly people.  Worth checking out!  (Do they have wi-fi?  the cell reception inside was terrible - was trying to look at their website before our food was brought out)"}
{"text":"I havr been to Uberrito 3 times now for lunch since they are located super close to my office. Everything i have had there has been delicious. As someone who has been a frequent Chipotle customer for many years, I can honestly say that I like this place just as much. Since I am pescatarian, it is refreshing to see so many seadfood and vegetarian options on the menu and they cook the shrimp fresh for you if your order it. Today I got the nachos and they are amazing!"}
{"text":"I work in the area and started coming here ever since they opened. Since that first visit the employees have been knowledgeable and friendly. They able to create amazing dishes that rival Chipotle and Quodoba. They were able to accurately take and make my orders even on the first day and that's saying something! (Great Training) They are quick at getting food out which is nice on my lunch break, when I only have 30 minutes to eat. I look forward to coming in because I know I will see a friendly face. The food is delicious, fresh, and not greasy. I love Uberrito a lot more than Chipotle or qudoba due to these facts. I would definitely recommend uberrito to anyone who is looking for fresh new age style Mexican food, however, it's not just limited to modern new age mexican. They still have the classics such as quesadillas, bowls, nachos, or plain old tacos (the two-timer). They made a regular out of me and I'm in here multiple times per week. Of course every place is not perfect and if they mess up your order they will instantly correct it. The management is amazing here and not afraid to take responsibility for a problem. If you stop in consider trying my favorite, the Forked Pork, you won't regret it.  Uberrito is definitely above your average Mexican joint.  -James"}
{"text":"Was super excited to try it before the othe location opens. But I don't see the appeal. The chicken was burnt, no beef options (still cooking I guess). Refried beans had no taste, nor did the Spanish rice. The chicken had a weird spice taste to it. Bowl was only half filled. Only good thing was the corn (that seemed to be taken out of a bag or can).  Not worth $22 for two meals with drinks and cookies.   Glad Im not going to wait in line for the new store opening and $2.99 meals.  Only 2 star for the cookies."}
{"text":"What a great alternative to the other chain burrito houses! This review may be a tad bias because I have recently moved from Phoenix to the Midwest, therefore a fresh take on designer burritos makes me insanely happy! Uberrito is a TX based operation with only a handful of stores.  The atmosphere: casual, bright and trendy and clean. If you don't grab your food to go, you will feel comfortable devouring your meal at one of the booths.   The food: I admit, I didn't orders burrito. I had two tacos: pork and the vegetarian. The pork was insanely good! Each taco is priced around $3, a little steep but when you see the quality of ingredients - you understand why.  The flavor of each taco was spot on and very fresh.   The service: excellent, everyone behind the counter was helpful and friendly!   If you are in the area, Uberrito is worth a try! I can only hope they look to open a franchise in Iowa."}
{"text":"This great little, fast food spot is rather hidden so look closely.  It's just to the east of Z-Tejas on the NE corner of Tatum and Shea, behind other businesses right at Shea.  But finding this spot is well worth the effort!  Very clean mexican flavor based dishes and you can have any combination of items you wish, so very personalized.  I'm really glad I found this place, like it better than Rubio's or Baja Fresh, and I like those a lot too.  Be sure to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Do you hear that wooshing sound? It is the race to fill the void left by chipotle's follies.   Uberito hopes to be the next big fast casual thing in Mexican food, however a few things drag them down.  I had the beer battered cod bowl, Which was a salad bowl with rice, beans, overly salty sauted spinach and mushrooms, and many other usual ingredients, some chipotle dressing, and topped with a broken up piece of fried fish.  My issues start with that fish, it tasted like a cheap fish stick, it has that odd wet batter taste near the fish with a crispy outside, it was so lack luster my son even spit it out.  The sauted veggies were extremely salty,and overall the flavors did not meld all of that well. and for $9 my regular bowl left me hungry.  We also went at a group of 4 other had tacos, and my wife had a vegan bowl, we all got our food at vastly different times."}
{"text":"Great place and great people.  They were very helpful and the food is awesome.  I love that they have sauteed mushrooms that you can add to your burrito."}
{"text":"Just another Chipotle with better ingredients and better environments and better food overall I was extremely satisfied over here I like the food although they have a very fast turnover on employees as much as I go there I am still unknown"}
{"text":"Food is great, over 5 star! Except the cashier today had too much attitude for working in customer service. Hope she was just having a bad day. It was smart that she wasn't wearing her badge."}
{"text":"Chipotle, who???? This place is sooo much better. More options and the food tastes better.  I've never been a chipotle fan so I was hesitant to come here because I figured a chain that is pretty much the same thing was probably going to have the same taste in their food. I was wrong.  The salsa options are phenomenal as well as the topping options. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Dirty restaurant.  Poor service and health violations. When they were preparing my food I was deciding if I should leave because of how dirty it was but when I saw him adjust his pants with the rubber glove on and then that same hand had his fingers in my bowl I kindly said please cancel my order. The staff is dirty looking to.  I can't rate the food because I left but I should call the health department"}
{"text":"This place was picked by chance. We were driving around and needed a quick place to eat. This place appealed to me based on someone's review saying it was better than Chipotle and I love Chipotle. I can't argue with the person. I got the nachos and they were able to add all the extra stuff I wanted along with extra chips at the end. I would go back here."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is worth it. Good fresh food. You pick what you want. Good prices. Burrito was very big. Clean looking place. Come and eat"}
{"text":"Food was very good. I wish the people would've been more welcoming and interested and looked less \"bored and bothered\" by our questions especially since it was our first time.   Didnt care for the guy with super sagging pants (dont wanna see ur underwear) who was a bit rude when asked for salsa."}
{"text":"Holy moly this place is amazing!!! Needing dinner and happened to find this place on Yelp... So. Glad. I. Did! My husband got the steak burrito and said it was one of the best burritos he's ever had (he LOVES Chipotle, and he said he liked it better than that, so that was saying a lot); he actually said he wanted to open one of these so he could eat there all the time :P Now onto MY glorious meal (I didn't even try his because he got spicy stuff on it and I don't mess around with that). I've recently been on an \"I'm not eating meat\" kick, so eating out has been a challenge. I got one of their tacos called \"The Triple T\" (which I mistakenly called \"The Triplet\" when I ordered, because I failed to see the space between words :P). It had blackened tofu (don't knock it; it was phenomenal!) mixed with corn salsa, pico, and avocado, with cotija cheese all on a corn tortilla. Every single bite I couldn't believe how amazing the flavor was!! Highly, highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic.  The shrimp bowl is incredible.  One of my favorite spots to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Super friendly and outgoing staff. Manager happened to be nearby and joined in explaining all of our food options. Much better selection than their big competitor. Tasty chips and salsa. Also the place has a really cool vibe and the decor is very clean."}
{"text":"There is a new one on 44th and Indian school road. Ok Tacos are one of my favorite foods. ONE DOES NOT SCREW AROUND WITH TACOS.....they call a \"crispy\" taco a corn tortilla warmed in a press...so the ingredients just tear that tortilla all to pieces....yuk quacamole??? one does not put so much onion id the quac...ok ate there once...NEVER AGAIN..."}
{"text":"Good- re fried beans I would pass on... carnitas very good.  Very clean and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Awesome! Fast, beautiful location. Not mobbed yet like Chipotle."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant - so much better than Chipotle!! I'm super bummed they closed the Shea location especially when they are building up the 32nd St and Shea corridor."}
{"text":"Came here to meet a friend before a seminar and was blown away how fresh the ingredients are. The staff was awesome to explain to us how it worked. They are like a Chipotle but with more options.  The bowl was huge barely finished everything."}
{"text":"Bomb.com- that's seriously what I can say. First time I ordered off uber eats and I fell in love. Make sure you get the queso dip on your burrito or bowl. You will fall in love."}
{"text":"I have no idea why I've never been to Uberrito before but I finally tried it the other day. My husband and I tried four different tacos. I think my favorite ones were the tree hugger and forked pork. My not so favorite were the Texas cheesesteak and and Sloppy Cowboy taco. Next time, I think I will build my own tacos/bowls. The guacamole and chips were ok. Guacamole needed more lemon and salt as it tasted a little bland and they didn't give a lot of chips.   I'll be back though. Yes, hands down better than chipotle!"}
{"text":"Went to Uberrito for the 1st time about 3 months ago and now I'm a 2-3 times a week customer. I've slowly been trying everything on the menu and have yet to find something I don't enjoy. The place is always clean and the staff of always eager to make suggestions. I have completely forgot about that \"C\" place...You want great food and lots of it, visit a Uberrito near you !!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's freshness and variety of toppings puts Chipotle to shame."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Service was disorganized and slow. They said they were out of taco shells and queso. How is that possible.  One in our group did not get her food until most of us were done. Food was decent....pretty fresh. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Thought this might be better then chipotle but would rather chance chipotle then old chicken and soggy veggies . Dissapoint ing to say the least"}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant because we saw there was a vegan option on the menu. We ordered the Vegan Picadillo Bowl and Treehugger Tacos. The dishes were prepared before us according to our preferences. It follows after the tradition of Chipotle, but has some different healthy vegan/vegetarian options. We enjoyed a wonderfully light & refreshing lunch."}
{"text":"Their food has been great quality each time have had it and I love the location and atmosphere. The staff on the other hand have been less than superb. Some of them are attentive and great, but some of them don't seem to care that you or them are there. In addition I have seen some of their staff hiding in the dumpster enclosure behind the dumpster smoking. With some better staff this place could be in great shape."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Similar concept to Chipotle, bit more choices for garnishes and entree meats. Prices better too. Highly recommend it if your in the area."}
{"text":"Our new To Go Mexican joint in town. Any day any time, always up for Uberrito. It is a new Chipotle style Mexican fast food place with a grill that produces restaurant level tacos. Love it!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are great.   Love the build your own tacos.  Queso dip is just okay.   Very clean modern decor."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this restaurant SO MUCH. Clean, delicious food, and great prices! Such a fun family friendly environment. Will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"Absolutely not. We walked in a half hour before they closed and they had already turned off the fryer so I couldn't order the battered cod... who makes themselves unable to serve their menu items BEFORE close? The child at the start of the line made comment of not having gloves.... finally fetched gloves and then they asked if they could dish items without tongs.... so thank god they found gloves, right?! I don't even care what the food tastes like, the adult who left these children here alone should be appalled."}
{"text":"Food here is pretty damn tasty for fast casual. Two things knocked it down a notch for me, though: the staff and the process. The staff seemed disappointed/annoyed that my group had never ordered off the chaotic menu before (we're used to the build your own idea of Chipotle). It's obvious that they have to explain it frequently. Then there's the options - good idea in theory, but it also shines a light on why other BYO chains keep it simple. You get up there and you're kinda fumbling through options. A more streamlined ordering process would be great, but like i said, food was solid. On par with something like Q'doba."}
{"text":"Newly opened and very delicious! An amped up version of chipotle. Different flavors & different options. Mexican rice, refried beans, spinach, jalape√±os, and a variety of salsa! So delicious! Tastes like there's less sodium that chipotle & the chicken I received had no fatty parts whatsoever. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow.  So good!  I stopped in to try it because they are generous sponsors of Scottsdale Aquatic Club, and I was not disappointed.  This is like chipotle but even better - way more options.  I will definitely be back to try more combinations.  Thank you for providing great food at a reasonable price, and for sponsoring local youth programs!"}
{"text":"I forgot to review them yesterday!  A friend gave me some $10 gift cards since she is friends with the owner or manager.  I was at an appointment nearby and stopped by for a late lunch.    The lady working was super excited to learn it was my first time there and told me all about it and suggested a few of her faves.  I opted for a Sloppy Cowboy taco and Tree Hugger taco (added chicken) with some chips and guac.    Sloppy Cowboy was strong flavored with a nice spicy kick but it was very heavy and filling.  I did not expect one taco to fill me up so much!    Tree Hugger was absolutely incredible!  The flavor combinations were absolutely fantastic and are a bit lighter than the previous taco.  I won't order it with chicken next time but that's only because it was plenty filling without it.  This is my favorite!  The only remotely negative thing I can think of is so dumb.  The guac was too big and I couldn't eat half of it so I ended up wasting a lot.  It was like $5 + for the guac so I wish I could have eaten it all.  But that is such a stupid complaint, I know.    No doubt about it, I will be back!  It's fresh tasting and has some healthier options than its main competitor.  Love all the variety and fun options (any place with jicama is a winner in my book)!"}
{"text":"If your looking for quick delicious Mexican food, √úberrito is one of the best spots in AZ.  They have a wide variety of options and everything is made as you order with fresh delicious ingredients. My favorite are the tacos, they have a great combination for any flavor your feeling and everything can be customized to your liking!"}
{"text":"I love the food from uberrito but the service is incredibly slow. There is no sense of urgency. The food is great and is the only reason I go back."}
{"text":"So happy to have stumbled across this place. The nachos were fantastic and the building was clean."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for good Mexican. So far I love their burritos and the tree hugger taco (actually vegetarian). I thought the Serrano ranch taco was just ok and I didn't care for the forked pork taco. I love how clean these restaurants are and this location is very organized also. Not sure how I'll keep up with all the options for Mexican so I'm writing this review to remind myself what I like here. Ha ha. Very casual and great for lunch or dinner when you are in a rush."}
{"text":"A fantastic selection of tasty food that you can put together how you like. If you like Chipotle, you are going to love it here. Beware of the Habanero salsa, it sneaks up on you!"}
{"text":"Very pleased with my first visit here! Think chipotle but more ingredient options and you can also get nachos. Ordering is a little confusing just because there are so many options but most of what they have is easy to recognize. Everything looked fresh and the pork nachos I got tasted great. Queso and chipotle sauce were bomb. The restaurant looks very nice and is clean!"}
{"text":"Definitely NOT better than a chipotle burrito, but still edible. I like that they have more options for the burrito, but it doesn't matter much if it still isn't better than a chipotle burrito AND more expensive. I'll be sticking with chipotle burros moving forward :) the cookie is okay also."}
{"text":"Great new alternative to Chipotle, and a lot more to offer here.  Great food, very reasonably priced and interesting modern design elements in the interior.  Fortunately for us, it's also close to home. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I so want to give √úberrito 5 stars- the food is amazing, the establishment is always clean, I am just not sold on the customer service. Sometimes our food doesn't always come out right but when asked to fix it we are sometimes given an attitude. All and all great food which keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"Blows Chipotle out of the water. There is so much variety here. Mushrooms and saut√©ed spinach, different types of tortillas and tasty salsas/ sauces. All the meat is good quality as well. The tacos are also delicious. The Texas cheesesteak is one of the best tacos I've ever had! Only reason I had to take away one star is because they close at 9 and I end up never having a chance to get in after work."}
{"text":"We are here now. I just had the Texas Cheesesteak taco and it was the best taco I have ever had. I also got a burrito with grilled shrimp and medical rice with the habanero salsa cheese and sliced jalepenos and it was amazing. All of our food was excellent such a great option for quick burritos and tacos. I love that they have spinach and jalepeno cheddar tortillas to choose from and lots of items like saut√©ed mushrooms to add to your burrito."}
{"text":"Hot hot hot! I got the shrimp tacos and they were spicy! I had to scrape off as much of the salsa as I could to enjoy my tacos. I probably should have stuck to a bowl. The concept is similar to Chipotle or Qdoba but there seems to be a lot more options and the interior is brighter and had a more cheery vibe. The boyfriend got the nachos and the portion was huge! It's a little out of the way for me so I'm not sure how often we'll be back but if you're in the area, give it a shot. Just be careful with the salsas, maybe ask to sample if you're not sure. Especially if you're a wimp like me!"}
{"text":"First all of I want to start by saying I am a big fan of chipotle and qdoba so I thought I would give this place a try. The place itself looks really nice but the food was not. I ordered a bowl and my boyfriend ordered a burrito. To start they put literally almost NO rice and beans, I felt I was getting a sample, the meat was the only thing I liked (chicken). We also decided to get queso and chips. Don't get that, chips were stale and queso tasted like velveta melted. So if you are thinking about going to chipotle or qdoba or here, you got your answer. Qdobas queso kills this one. Not coming anymore."}
{"text":"This is just an off brand chipotle or qdoba, but I will say their ingredients all seemed very fresh and they had a few unique sauces and spices that were good. Service was good and restaurant was clean from what I saw."}
{"text":"First impression walking in was a Chipotle type restaurant but the food is WAY better. You can taste the freshness and the options and varieties available are immense. Highly recommended:)"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.. fresh mex.. you can have it your way.. salad, bowl, tacos, burrito.. pick your protein and toppings.. not a new concept.. and they got it right here.   I got the carnitas bowl on today's visit ..cilantro rice, black beans, carnitas, mushrooms, spinach, 2kinds of salsa .. and a squeeze of lime.. easy! It was good, it's not trying to be fancy or authentic Mexican food.   The fresh lime squeeze is how we do it at home .. I liked that option. They also have tapatio & cholula by the fountain drinks.  It smells really good when you walk in.. friendly and fast service, dining area was clean and spacious, plenty of parking, easy to find .."}
{"text":"Super impressed with this place. The atmosphere is refreshing and \"fresh.\" The staff is very friendly.   It is similar to a chipotle but with way more options. They have fish, shrimp, beef, steak, carnitas, chicken, and vegan picadillo as protein options which you can make into a salad, burrito, or bowl.   They have four different tortilla flavors, Mexican or cilantro lime rice, and black, pinto, or refrained beans. The saut√©ed spinach is delicious.   They have a huge variety of vegetables and 7 different Salsas as well. The tomatillo is delicious and the habanero is deliciously spicy.   Everything aside from the meat, cheese, ranch, and aoli is vegan... They are very veggie friendly here and they promote it which is awesome.   You can also get tacos.. They have 10 different taco options including a vegan option. They also have tortilla soup, chips, cookies, and a kids menu with quesadilla and chicken nuggets in addition to tacos, bowls, and burritos.  The food was really good, fresh, and left the three of us very satisfied! Don't forget to grab a loyalty card!!"}
{"text":"Holy crap. I never ever ever thought I'd say this... But I found something better than Chipotle. Like. WAYYY better. Amazing options, so much flavor. Makes Chipotle taste bland. Fribedly staff. Please do yourself a favor and come try a bowl. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. I had their tacos. Bowls are good too. I'll be going back. The Texas Cheesesteak Taco was delicious. Off The Hook (fish taco) was really good as well. You can request flour tortillas if you don't like corn. The staff was really friendly.   I went back the next day and got the Chicken Cheesy and Diablo Shrimp (so spicy) tacos. Both were very good. But I liked my choices better the first day.   I think this place is a lot more tasty and interesting than Chipotle. There was also a lot of cute guys that kept coming in :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place on Cinco de Mayo. The staff was super friendly and helpful. They have gluten free options (major plus). Kids meals are legit. The food is fresh and lots of options on the build your own. Portion sizes with the protein are perfect. BLOWS CHIPOTLE OUT OF THE WATER."}
{"text":"The food is pretty decent and fresh, however, the service is so nasty. They would've gotten one star for service, but I upped it to three since the food is decent. The girls that work here are young, clueless, unfriendly and pretty bitchy. You never get a smile or a hello or a thank you, unless of course they are on their phones talking to their friends, which they do right in front of you regularly. They are all so quiet that you can't even hear them speak. The girl tonight had to repeat my order about four times until I could hear what she was actually saying.  And that was in between her rolling her eyes at me. They bring the food to the table and practically throw it at you. I'm sure they're not all like that, but my last three encounters have been that way with multiple girls, so I won't be back.  We've been coming here weekly since we are taking dog training lessons at the Petsmart in the same mall, but I'm done with them now. There are much happier places around."}
{"text":"3.75 stars to be precise. We got a coupon in the mail and decided to give this place a go. Upon arrival, we noticed the similarities between this place and chipotle. A build your own burrito, bowl, tacos, etc kinda deal where you go down a line of things that you want or don't want. I had a bowl w/ their vegan tofu mix, black beans, cilantro rice, spinach, mushrooms, lettuce, pico, corn. I have to say that the cooked spinach and mushrooms were a great addition to the typical burrito bowl. There were plenty of choices as we went down the line.   As I feasted on my bowl, I noticed that it could use a bit more \"Zazz,\" and a little less salt on everything involved. My girlfriend enjoyed hers, and pointed out that perhaps I could've have gotten another salsa. Could be true. I was mostly disappointed by the undercooked rice. It was a large part of the meal..so the rice, though simple, is a big deal.   The giant cookie was delicious. We had white choco macadamia. Friendly staff.  I could definitely come back again. Just not sure it'll be my first choice."}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid.  I was feeling a fish taco and almost drove to Rubios but decided to come here instead.  I had a fish taco almost exactly a year ago here and it was so good!  So again I came in, ordered the Off da Hook taco and was so please.  Huge hunk of fried cod topped with pickled slaw and chipotle mayo.  So good I wish I ordered 2.  I also got the chicken tortilla soup.  It was meh, said it had pinto beans, but I had no beans in my soup.  They do add a half an avocado to the soup so that was a bonus!  I don't think I'll get the soup again.  I also had to add almost an obscene amount of salt to add flavor...  it didn't have any spices added so it seems.  I'm definitely coming back and I want to try their bowls next.  Everything looked really fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"First time here. Good, fresh food,  friendly service. Two reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars:  rice is undercooked and nobody asked about our experience after we sat down so I could tell someone the rice is undercooked.  It probably wouldn't be a consideration if we hadn't been asked if it was our first time when we stepped up to order. Also, we were literally the only patrons in the place. You'd think someone would have had a moment to stop by our table to follow up.   My concern with the concept of having all the ingredients on display is for wheel chair users - are they able to see what I can see? Otherwise the facility is accessible."}
{"text":"I came across this place in a Yelp search to try something new. It is very similar to Chipotle in the layout and style of food. However there are a lot more ingredient options and some menu dishes as well. Quick review: step up from Chipotle with more options and still great flavor. Got two bowls.   My girlfriend duplicated her Chipotle order as a good safe bet to start with. She was immediately impressed and happy with the fact that there isn't cilantro in everything. She got a bowl with Spanish rice, black beans, chicken, corn and a little sour cream. At Chipotle her rice and corn would have sour cream... she's not a fan. For me! I went a little overboard because of the ingredient options at Uberrito.I got a bowl with Spanish rice, black beans, chicken, the three hot salsa's, pico, fresh jalapeno's, cilantro, a little chipotle and fresh avocado. My girlfriend was very happy with the flavor and lack of cilantro, she is a fan and will be back again. I was also very happy and enjoyed all the options."}
{"text":"Delicious! I ordered using Uber eats, so I don't know how the store experience feels, but the menu selection and taste is similar to chipotle, but they have more options. Taste is amazing, I'll definitely be ordering again!!"}
{"text":"Why is this place not packed every day?  I've been here several times and it's always good food & friendly service.  Great variety from the very meaty to vegan, all tasty.  Like spinach?  This is your place.  Go.  Eat.  Enjoy.   9/5/17 If the Sloppy Cowboy & Tree Hugger tacos can exist harmoniously side by side on my plate, then the rest of us can on this spinning blue ball.  Great tacos, man.  Great freakin' tacos."}
{"text":"Good, solid food with a quasi-Mexican orientation. Good sized servings off fresh food served by friendly people. The biggest negative is the noise level; the shiny interior almost amplifies sound. We ate outside. Sure it's on the parking lot, but with a nice breeze it is AZ delight. Since this is within walking distance of our home and they offer their meals as salads, I see many visits."}
{"text":"way better version of chipotle! Must try the fajita steak no matter what you get. Queso is delicious and just how they serve it in Texas! Great guac and huge portions!!!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Should have known better as it was dead at 6:30pm. Had the fish taco and shared some shredded beef nachos. First off the girl up front had zero personality. ZERO. Told her two times we had never been in before and asked her how it worked and she could barely even respond -very short and unhelpful.   This fish taco was basically an over battered frozen fish stick with an overly sweet slaw on top. Bleghhhh. Disgusting.   Nachos-how can you screw up nachos? Right?? Shredded beef was super salty like it had been sitting - chips salty, nacho cheese had a sweet flavor. It was just not good. Everything that had flavor-was just...off. Something just did not taste right. Their flavor profiles are nasty imo.  Had to drink lots of water to wash the nasty sweet flavor a out. Yea this place has more selection than chipotle but chipotle's flavors are  decent and fresh   It's too bad too because the place itself is super modern and cute on the inside."}
{"text":"This is my favorite fresh Mex location to date.  Very bright and comfortable environment, inviting employees, quick service, excellent selection (build your own), high quality meats and produce.  I get the large bowl splitting rices as well meats (pork carnitas and grilled chicken) - it's a taste bud n tummy pleaser.  I've only been able to eat the whole bowl once to date - so love a leftovers box for a snack later in the day!  All this for under $8!  Wow right?  I'm a happy customer.  The whole place is very clean including the bathrooms.  They have a points rewards program!  I'm a member! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you're afraid of the Chipotle scare, look no further because Uberrito is here to save the day! It's the another fast casual dining concept very similar to Chipotle but upgraded with far greater options. There are plenty of taco options and the burrito/bowls are pretty similar to Chipotle's but with a few nice additional touches. They also have two different bowl sizes to choose from.   Let's go over some of the options available:  Several meat/protein options - chicken, beef, pork, seafood, beans, etc Spanish or cilantro rice About 8 different types of salsas Leafy greens, cheeses, onions, lime, peppers, etc  All of this adds up to quite an outstanding fresh-mex experience that make Chipotle seem like an afterthought."}
{"text":"Right off the bat I liked this place. If you get a burrito you have four different tortilla options: flour, wheat, spinach or jalape√±o cheddar. And it only goes up from there!   You can build your own burrito, bowl or nachos and they have some chef selected tacos. Many more options to choose from as opposed to somewhere like chipotle. Black, pinto or refrained beans, white or Spanish rice...what looked to be something like 7 or so salsas, queso... guacamole or just plain avocado. You get the picture. They also offer fish and shrimp in addition to the standard beef, chicken, steak etc. options.   Not only was my burrito delicious, but for 2.99 you can upgrade to a combo which includes a drink AND .. a cookie!!! Score. Nice way to change it up since chips and queso or salsa always seems a little much to have along with a full burrito.. I get too full to really have a \"side\" and the cookie was a cool touch.   Really friendly guy helped us out too. He noticed it was our first time by our intense staring at the menu and he was super friendly and explained the entire process. Will definitely be back!  They also have a rewards program, if that is up your alley."}
{"text":"Went in to try out this new place with my bf.  We had a couple customizations to our order... - No Tomato (bf is allergic) -No Ranch on one of the tacos   Upon ordering our food, they made our burrito first.  It appeared that they made our tacos wrong and had to remake them- so then our burrito sat out and got cold while they remade our tacos.  They almost forgot our chips and guac which we had to re-request.  Upon arriving home, the sauce was still on the taco, and his tacos still had tomatoes on it, to which my boyfriend could not eat.   Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing and super fresh food and the staff are always awesome! Just take heed, the hot sauce is hot!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down one of the best tacos I have ever eaten. I've eaten lots of tacos from so many places.  Place is clean, staff friendly food extremely yummy."}
{"text":"Uber good burrito bowl!  I don't know what it is-but this place is \"burry\" much better than Chipotle or Qdoba.  The flavors smack you right where it counts-in your taste buds.  Zippy and creamy.  I always get the chicken bowl-and the cilantro cream sauce is the ticket-adds creamy to the spicy equaling fabulousness.  Love the add on combo with the cookie+ drink.  The cookie is soft and full of chocolate chips.  Also they have a Loyalty Card-another one up on Chipotle and the Q."}
{"text":"Loved their tacos and the quality of the ingredients seemed high.  Normally this would be a 5-star, but I do feel its a bit overpriced, but still excellent food."}
{"text":"It's going to be very hard to have anything from Chipotle again after having Uberrito. The food is incredible and they have a great, unique selection of ingredients (spanish rice, shredded beef, different salsas). Their taco selection is also not what you'd find elsewhere and is very good.  There are some occasional service issues we've run into, such as tacos taking a long time or food waiting out on the counter for ~10 minutes with employees just standing around. The food was a bit cold by the time we asked if it was ours, they said \"oh, yeah\", and wrapped it up.  Otherwise, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We go here pretty regularly because it's local and relatively healthy for fast\"ish\" food.  Think Chipotle - but more variety.  It has a similar process and menu to Chipotle, but more selection for protein (such as grilled shrimp or fish) and broader variety of 'fixings'. One of their best items is the jicama slaw - it's great on the Shrimp or fish!  They have a kids meal of dinosaur chicken nuggets as well - which is awesome because my kids are not big fans of burritos. It's great food; good value (esp considering the quality) and pretty consistent.  The only thing I don't love is the speed.  When it's busy - they need to get their process moving better to get through the line.  ;)"}
{"text":"I had just concluded a meeting at the Starbucks next door and wanted a light snack. Uberitto has recently opened in the center so I went in to look at the menu. It looked interesting but was essentially a Chipotle or Qdoba clone. It was around 3.30 and the place was empty save for one customer ahead of me, ordering two large bowls.   I opted for a mini do it yourself bowl and went down the line. I chose some rice and beans, a mild salsa and corn and opted for the steak as the protein.  The so called steak was some scraps of dried meat in a a metal container. I seriously thought they would say \"hang on sec, we have some fresh steak coming\". No chance. The high school sophomore doing the serving scraped up literally a teaspoon of dried meat and put it into my bowl. As an aside, the dine-in in bowls are literally dog water bowls. Not very appetizing.  My order was completed before the woman ahead of me and the cashier could not check me out until she had considered every possible combination.  I waited patiently and finally paid.  By this time I'm sure the dry steak in my meal had become jerky.  I sat down with this dog bowl for $7.26 and I promise you the ASPCA would have come after me if I served that mess to a dog.  Not to be repeated. A nasty experience.  UPDATE To their credit the management responded to my post. I will try them again and change my rating if there is genuine improvement."}
{"text":"I went for lunch around 1:00pm and they were out of many items. No back beans or lids for cups. Also, no chicken was made and would be an hour before it would be ready. Everything was cold. The queso was cold and sold...it reminded me of s Kraft Single."}
{"text":"Great new concept from tx! Updated version of that 'other' brand + ya don't get sick! Fresh inviting look & great menu. Nice location w/pkg! Give it a try"}
{"text":"Way, WAY better than chipotle. More ingredients and toppings, fresher food in general. More options and $5 chicken burritos or bowls on Mondays. Excellent."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time yesterday. I ordered the bowl option combo with steak. Some observations: 1. Friendly staff 2. The bowl had an extremely high salt content. Barely edible. 3. The beef lacked normal texture, as if boiled. Quite mushy. 4. I am currently exhausted. I spent half of the night in the bathroom (if you know what I mean). I have an iron stomach and was raised 10 min from Mexico so there was something tainted in the food or perhaps it wasn't being kept at the proper temp. 5. At least their cookie was good but one doesn't patronize such an establishment for cookies. 6. The price was fair but I don't plan on returning because I like my sleep more than I like this food."}
{"text":"Build it yourself nachos. That's all you need to know.   But in all seriousness, Chipotle better watch its back. √úberrito offers the same setup, but with more options. And did I mention NACHOS?!   The store decor is fun and trendy, which makes my lunch break from work that much better."}
{"text":"For my first time, I will give it 5 stars. I ordered two tacos. One Off the hook fish taco and the other was  a Forked pork taco. They were both delicious.  I thought the Forked pork taco was very flavorful, and the size was generous. The fish taco too, was tasty and generous. I also ordered chips and guac. The guac was freshly made and delicious. Much better than Chipotle restaurant with more choices! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Very nice modern interior with concrete floors and organized areas.  Same model as Chipotle with maybe a little more items.  We ordered the Burrito with Shedded Pork Carnitas and 2 tacos. One taco was the Fish Taco called Off The Hook and the Fajita Steak called Texas Cheesesteak.   The burrito went down the line and you add which ever items you choose and then the main protein which we had the Shredded Pork Carnitas. We added white rice, white rice, black beans, saut√©ed mushrooms, shredded cheese with Pico De Gallo. Pretty good overall, just like a Chipotle Burrito.  As far as the tacos, I liked the fish taco - Off the Hook, the beer battered cod fish had a crisp crunch to it and the combination of cabbage slaw, Pico De Gallo with chipotle aioli sauce was very good. I would order this taco again.  The Texas Cheesesteak Taco which included Fajita Steak with mushrooms, onions, jalape√±o with a Serrano Ranch sauce was good but did not have the wow factor.  I liked the overall restaurant as something quick or a good lunch place.  I would come back again."}
