{"text":"Have to say I LOVED the malt vinegar mayo and fries but that is all I had so I should probably reserve my judgment until I eat a meal. However Wednesdays were half price wine soooo, I had an A-Ok time :)"}

{"text":"Had a very nice brunch at the Tavern.  We ordered the chorizo and eggs and the lobster benedict.  Both orders were cooked well and delicious.  They were also actually decently priced for the amount of food we received.  I definitely recommend this place for brunch."}
{"text":"3 stars for drinks special. 
None for the food. 
Appetisers seemed refried and presentation lack lustred. Ambiance is great but kitchen could definitely improve."}
{"text":"First impression was great. Good crowd, comfortable environment and chill music. Tried the deep fried snickers bar which looked good and was yummy. Need to go back and try everything else!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite to eat and a beer today and was thoroughly impressed.  Firstly, the menu is spectacular.  It is easy to see Trevor's influence and creativity in the menu.  The prices are very reasonable and the few items I have tried so far (Double Smoked Bacon & Pork Belly Poutine, Crispy Foie Gras, Tavern Burger) have been spectacular.  I look forward to going back to try more of the menu items.  The atmosphere is very comfortable and welcoming.  This will definitely be my go to spot for a quick meal for the next little while."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER. 

I went with a group of 5 girls for brunch on a Sunday afternoon.  Once we sat down it took about 30 minutes to get a glass of water.  The server randomly forgot one glass then when we asked for the last one she brought us an empty glass...weird.  Another 10 minutes later  we got our caesars all without rimmer even though the menu said they had it.  When she brought our drinks we ordered because who knew when she'd be back again.  

During this time period we saw people standing by the door waiting for tables not being helped for over 20 minutes.  Once they did sit down the servers took so long to attend to them that we saw 3 tables sit down and then decide to leave while we were waiting for our food.  It was the most shocking service I've probably EVER seen.  We considered getting up and walking out the entire time had it not been for the alcohol we ordered. 

After 1.5 hours we still had no food.  When it finally did come, they messed up the BLTs and didnt even put bacon on it so we had to complain again.  Also, when all our food came we all had no silverware or napkins...you would think we'd have this after hours of waiting.  The server came up with an excuse telling us the kitchen ran out eggs so they had to go get some.  I've never heard of a restaurant running out of eggs on a Sunday brunch so this seemed like a weird lie to me. 

All in all the food was actually quite good but the service makes me shiver when I think of this place.  Word to the wise, dont go here. 

The only good thing was they comped our food to makeup for everything, however it was such an awful experience it didnt even make a difference to me."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of having some drinks and grub with my friend last night at The Tavern. I loved the Old Fashioned made by our hostess Oliviya. Herb salted frites and buffalo chicken sandwich were great. I need to come back to sample the brunch menu."}
{"text":"One tip order the dressing on the side for the salads. After we mentioned the salads had too much dressing, our waitress took both off the tab. Shocking!! Wait amazing service! 
Very unexpected and impressive. Thanks for taking care of us!!"}
{"text":"Came here a few times through out my Holliday. Nice environment though could be lighter. Staff where very friendly and helpful and attentive. Loved their happy hour! Also tired their poutine was quite nice except for the bit of gristle."}
{"text":"I got there today shortly after they opened at 11 a.m. - my group and I were still waiting for 2 people.  The waitresses were kind enough to take my name down but we ended up going in shortly after anyway.  It was still pretty empty when we arrived.  They sat us in the back with the stools and high-backed chairs where we had some privacy (they offered to seat us at the communal table but we quickly changed our minds for obvious reasons!).

Our server was friendly and attentive (and I have to say, very pretty!!) but not pushy.  She offered to get us drinks while we waited and checked on us before and after our last two friends arrived.  She also checked on us during our meals (some waitresses just completely forget about you!).  

Our food came out pretty quickly and amongst us we ordered: the smoked pork belly and pulled pork poutine (my order!), BLT, two grilled cheeses, the egg white frittata, and croissant/brioche side combo (also a bellini and mimosa). I was too focused on my poutine and didn't ask for a taste of the other dishes but I was told they were very good!  My poutine had big chunks of smoked pork belly, tasty gravy, cheese (couldn't tell they were curds), and pulled pork.  When the waitress told me it was pulled pork (before ordering), I was expecting more sweetness but the savoury taste worked well with the other components.  I was expecting more cheese but I liked it just as it was (and seriously there are many chunks of pork belly throughout!).  I found the poutine to be very filling (I left comfortably full rather than too full to move which was great!  Trust me though, there is alot of food!).  The only thing I would have changed was for the pork belly to be more fatty -  it wasn't as tender as I would have liked - but it was still very good.  Also, it was only $11!!

My friend had ordered a bellini but they took a long time to bring it out so my friend told the waitress that it was okay and she didn't want it anyway.   So it was really nice for the waitress to give my friend a bellini on the house!  I didn't ask how the bellini was.  To be honest, I wanted to order one but I found all of the brunch drinks to be sort of pricey (the bellini and mimosa  were both $11 as I recall - so pricey relative to the brunch mains and the other menu items if you look them up).

I was eager to split the deep fried Snickers dessert with one of my friends but decided against it because I knew I'd probably grab something to eat a bit later but I can't wait to try it!  

Washrooms - The Tavern by Trevor appears to be part of a building that also hosts some other businesses.  You walk down a hall in the restaurant and then come into a communal hall area (it was clean but I found it almost sketch because it was kind of quiet back there and looked totally different from the restaurant - white walls, blue doors, and seemed like someone could be lurking lol).  Luckily the washrooms were clean and fully functional!  Also, the keys for the washrooms are on mini hockey sticks!!

Overall, I can't wait to return for brunch, dinner, and dessert!"}
{"text":"A \"$5 drink special all day Saturday\" sign was what got us in the door. We stopped by for lunch, and were pleasantly surprised with the schnitzel wrap, and nachos. Would recommend for cheap drinks."}
{"text":"Went with a buddy for wings and the maple curry wings are amazing. Amsterdam beers on tap cold and fresh. Amazing fries. Nice staff, good music, nice decor. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Came here for an early morning brunch, and was pleasantly surprised. Had the chicken and waffles, which came with two decent sized waffles and two very tasty pieces of chicken. It would have been nice had there been a bit of a garnish, a few pieces of salad or potatoes perhaps. 

I'd go back, and hope they're around for a while."}
{"text":"This is more a taverna than a tavern. It's not just a watering hole, as the name Tavern suggests, but a community place to taste and linger over great food, with a bit of a drink if you like.
But then the decor shows some trouble getting an identity. It has old cross country skis and hockey sticks along the side and lovely redone and rescued industrial wood on the tables . Is this a sports bar, I asked. It's still developing its identity, I was told.
I tried the kobe burger, my first ever. It was delicious. My friend had a melted cheese. What we noticed was that the tomato sauce was not industrial ketchup in a bottle. It was made in the kitchen. 
This ain't no tavern!!! This is a place for serious food.
They should have theme decor for what they are-- a taverna. In my ebook, Food for City Building, I argue that neighborhoods need restaurants that are a \"third place\" -- after home and work, a place in the 'hood where you can be yourself, meet friends, eat healthy and affordably. That's what this place can be."}
{"text":"It's been 8 months since my last review. The name is now Tavern on Spadina as Trevor has moved on to other things. His partner in the former business Mike is running things, and I'm happy to say without a blip. 

The kale salad is still one of the best in the city, and the staff are aware, smart and personable. The clientele are a great mix and the energy in the place palpable and friendly.

I sat here for an hour or two the night it was announced David Bowie had died, and everything, from the food to the service to the painting on the wall seemed to fit that mood, as a place of reflection and even solace.

Tonight my yoga class was wonderful and spring is in the air (at least for this ever hopeful Canadian ever conscious of the cruel jokes weather plays in this clime) and I'm in a very different place and this place fits perfectly tonight too.

Metaphors about comfort and community come to mind, but in the end it is just about a house that knows its brand, its clientele, and its setting, and gets it right. Every time."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a weekday.  Most items on the menu are fairly expensive ($11-$30), but the sandwiches essentially range from $10-$15.  There was a steak sandwich special when I went there which included roasted peppers, green olives, and arugula, with a side of fries and garlic mayo or aioli of some sort.  It was only $10 + tax, and it was pretty gourmet, filling, and I'm really glad I ordered it.  Instead of ordering fries I could have ordered a salad, but I'm a glutton.  My friend ordered the salad and it was a kale salad with pomegranite, apple, and some other cool ingredients--very innovative.  The restaurant itself is pretty classy and has cool artwork.  I'd go here again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Monday is one of my days off and I usually eat out,  whether by myself or with some company. I had no specific plans today and had to go to Union station to run an errand. Since it was around 6:30 pm when I was done, I thought I would walk up Spadina avenue and decide on something. Would it be Swatow? Jules? Pho Hung? Fresh? And then I saw Tavern at 147 Spadina. Trevor was on my resto hit list but I had read that he opened this other location, and there it was. So, I decided to go in. It was about 7:30 pm and just a few customers were in, so I decided to sit at the bar.

First of all, the three young women on staff tonight were all very nice and friendly. The bartender on duty (her name is Angela and as a side note is one of the loveliest, most agreeable and knowledgeable restaurant professionals I have met lately) took both my drink and food orders and knew the menu very well and could answer any question I had about the dishes. I felt like having a fancy drink and was expecting, like in most places to have to explain my drink. But no, Angela was awesome and actually could make me an Alabama highball! Orange juice, gin, vermouth, with a hint of amaretto. It was delicious, not too sweet, with just a hint of bitterness and surprisingly a great accompaniment to the food I ordered.

The bison and pork tourtiere, even though it comes in an out of the box shape( a round folded pie crust which looks slightly like a cornish pasty) is definitely worthy of the name and is as good if not better than a lot of tourtieres I had in Quebec. Lots of meat, very well seasoned and the crust being very firm and well done, not too crumbly. Very often, tourtiere can be very fatty. Most recipes use only pork. Some add beef but it can still have a high fat content. And if you use only beef, well, it is just not the same. In this case, by blending equal parts bison and pork, you cut drastically the fattiness of the dish while definitely improving on the flavour and subtleness of the dish, with every mouthful delivering a satisfying helping of meaty, pie-crusty goodness. The presentation is flawless, served on a white plate with apple chipotle sauce(great flavour combo) and shaved pickled beets on top. For 13 dollars, it is very reasonably priced for a dish of this quality. As a side, I had a very refreshing kale and jicama salad (5$). I was tempted by the frites (I am a potato monster) but it definitely would have been too much. Next time.

Angela suggested I have dessert (not only she is a great bartender and a very attractive young woman but she is a psychic, how did she know I have a sweet tooth?) and the deep fried Snickers bar seemed tempting but I opted on skipping sugar and opting for another of my favourite food groups, alcohol, instead. I asked Angela for a Tanqueray gin and tonic, which was also very well mixed.

Tavern by Trevor is not a pub. They only have 3 draft beers. But their strength is cocktails and they have a limited but pretty decent wine list. The food is awesome and it is very difficult to choose something as everything looks so good, which will justify further visits. Actually, the bartender told me that the owners also have Wide Open on Spadina a few doors down, another great place I enjoy.

My bill came around 42.00 which is reasonable, considering I had 2 great stiff drinks and that the food was of high quality. The service was wonderful, decor and atmosphere warm and cosy.
Overall, a great addition to the Richmond and Spadina/Chinatown area. Go, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Great food/drink/atmosphere, what else can you ask for. The staff was very friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Weeks ago I was walking up Spadina with Cracker. She took me to another Trevor project. I love Trevor. It's one of my favourite Toronto restaurants. I said it 2010, again in 2011 and if I thought you wouldn't get sick of me singing in all my very tone deaf beauty, I would sing it year after year.

Cracker took me to The Tavern for brunch (served between 11 and 3). It was what I have come to expect: honest food with flair. I had the egg white frittata with asparagus and 3 year old cheddar. It was more elegant than I expected for $15: Light, fluffy, perfectly cooked and well seasoned with ample amounts of black truffle and a tart arugula salad: aromatic and amazing.

Cracker had chorizo with crispy poached eggs and sweet potato hash, roquette and red pepper ailoi: a bright morning medley.

Great value for really great food. Comfort food elevated with primo ingredients and a touch of class. I hope this Tavern stays this way until my next visit."}
{"text":"Average. Not as good as Trevor's kitchen. 
Crispy fois gras is creative but needs more taste. Kale salad tasted like stale dressing. Poor wine choice by the glass. 
Great location and music."}
{"text":"Very relaxed atmosphere and low key for a casual after work drink with a friend or SO. Good music played usually common faves and classics. Good location and easy to get to, whAt more can you ask?"}
{"text":"Came here the other week for a bite after work. Had the beef check and bacon sandwich. It was also happy hour so I had a domestic micro-brew for $5!!!! The sandwich was great... all nice charred bits of beef cheek and crispy bacon with kale. 

My only issue was with the service. Our Waitress seemed a bit angry with us and when we asked about the sides was rather kurt, saying the fries were $6 and then seeming offended when we didn't order any."}
{"text":"First, the service was great, considering for the entire place there were only 2 people (one in the kitchen, and one server). Our server was a portrait of grace, given the busy day, but the kitchen did her NO favors.

We were in a hurry, so we asked given the circumstances if we could have our food quickly. Our server did make this happen, so I know she was really trying. However the food was bad.

We ordered the Tavern breakfast and the BBlt from the brunch menu.

The english muffin was burnt. Burnt black. Some of the side bacon was reasonably cooked, but some was severely undercooked. The back bacon, had burnt, charred bits that we scraped off to make the bacon edible. The bun on the BBlt was old and stale. The server replaced the burnt muffin with some toast that was well prepared. The vegetable cassoulet was dry, crusty and gross. 

It was pretty awful. We told our server, and she explained the staffing challenge. We understood, but as we left we saw another table where the patrons had left remnants of their food, underdone waffles, and undercooked chicken.

Finally, we have been here before and had good experiences for drinks and bar food. Brunch at Tavern by Trevor really needs to step up to even border on acceptable. Kudos to the server for her honesty and genuine efforts in a tough situation."}
{"text":"I love the Canadian theme going on at this place!

I ordered the grilled tofu, kale salad and steamed green beans. I was a bit skeptical at first with the salad since I normally hate horseradish and jicama, but combined it tasted amazing! The portion was a good size too considering the price. The dressing complements the kale well, since you don't get that acrid taste. 

The tofu is an absolute must order. Honestly the best tofu I ever had. It's both sweet and savoury. 

My cousin ordered the kobe beef burger which he also really enjoyed."}
{"text":"I have long been a fan of Trevor Kitchen + Bar on Wellington Street.  From the first time I had their Asiago Mac 'n Cheese to my varoius 'Licious experiences there, to indulging in all my foie gras laden desires as one of Toronto's restaurants that will pretty much put foie gras on anything for you at your request. So when I heard about their new sister restaurant Tavern by Trevor - I was ecstatic (especially since it was down the street from where I work).

While Trevor Kitchen + Bar is a cavernous, intimate, dimly-lit, white table cloths kind of place; the Tavern is what I'd call a watering hole that happens to have food.

My girlfriend took me to Tavern for my birthday dinner and I had high hopes considering how much I love its Wellington Street sister.  Unfortunately, you just can't compare Britney Spears to Audrey Hepburn and all the things I love about Trevor Kitchen + Bar are absent at Tavern.

First, the cocktails are awful.  I sent the first one back and got a second one which I also couldn't finish.  The art of creating a well-balanced cocktail isn't a feat that everyone can accomplish.  To be fair they're not called Speakeasy; so maybe I should've stuck with the beer instead?

Second, our server was one of the most aloof ones I've ever encountered in all my years as a diner.  She's exemplary as the reason why Toronto, despite all it's culinary talent is light years away from being known as a true culinary destination such as New York and Paris.  That's what happens when you have aspiring artists and university students working the service industry to support their aspirations.  They are like hobos who hop from train to train, but serving is not their final destination and it shows.

So last but not least, we arrive at the food.

We order a bunch of things to share.  More misses here than hits.

Foie gras is to me as a moth is to a flame.  If it's on the menu, I'm getting it.  We ordered the fried foie gras with Concord grape jelly.  More batter than foie here, and a thick thick batter at that.  I see it's been taken off the menu now.  Good riddance to that.  If they ever decide to put it back on the menu, I would refer them to Martin Picard's foie gras cromesquis as a reference guide.

Having not fulfilled my hankering for something deep fried, we also opt for the pickerel goujons  with lobster tartare sauce.  An improvement from the first dish, but I find the tartare sauce to be lacking in any discernible lobster flavoring.  If I closed my eyes, I quite possibly could've been eating dollops of McDonald's tartare sauce.

My eating spree thus far, having been all things deep fried guilts me into grabbing a side of kale salad.  Perhaps simplicity is the saving grace here; tossed in a zingy horsereadish dressing with jicama and parmesan - it was yummy.

In a desperate attempt to salvage my adoration for Trevor, we also order the bison & pork tourtière  with pickled beets & apple chipotle sauce.  The pastry is neither buttery enough nor flaky enough and the filling errs on the side of lean.  One of my favorite Quèbec specialties fails to perk me up.

My girlfriend orders the kobe beef burger to satisfy her inner carnivore and finally we have a glimmer of hope that our entire evening isn't going to hell in a handbasket.  She's a devout Catholic so I guess the Lord heard her prayers.  The burger was meaty, juicy (to the point of dripping) but it is everything you would want in a burger.  No extra condiments needed.

We probably should've stopped at the burger, but we also order the beef cheek & bacon, an open-faced sandwich served atop a slab of potato bread and garnished with coriander, kimchi, and ginger mayo.  At this point I think we were full from disappointment.

My partner in dine then chides that it's not a birthday dinner unless I have dessert so we opt for the deep fried Snickers bar à la CNE  with bourbon caramel & vanilla ice cream.  If this night has taught me anything, it's that clearly my girlfriend should start her own food blog.  Of all the things we eat, the kobe burger and this dessert were of her choosing and end up being my favorites of the night.

As heavy and decadent as the dessert sounded, it was surprisingly light.  Wrapped in sheets of phyllo, the Snickers bar was not just a fork full of stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth messiness.  The berries were also a nice addition to cut through the chocolate.  And with my final fork full of dessert; all was right in the world again.

At the end of the day I am still a fan of Trevor Kitchen + Bar; to be fair the food at Tavern is not cooked by Trevor Wilkinson and it is a totally different concept than it's original location.  I still remain a fan of its Wellington Street operation, but the Tavern fails me as both a watering hole and a place to grab food."}
{"text":"This place is one of our regular lunch and post work drink hangouts. There are always special offers on booze, and the food is pretty good. The best thing about it is the wait staff- they always remember me, but greet everyone as old friends, and they really seem to love their jobs. The outdoor patio is small, but perfectly located for watching the world go by- and my dog can sit the other side of the rail in comfort, enjoying the bowl of iced water they always bring for her."}
{"text":"So a friend and I stopped by this spot to grab a mea and catch up. The waitress was less than amused when we said we need a moment to look over the menu. She also wasn't too thrilled that neither one of us wanted to drink! I mean, come on, I was on medication that can't be consumed with alcohol (not that I owed her an explanation). Our food took quite some time to arrive which was fine because we were busy catching up, but when it did, we were less than thrilled. My burger was burnt to a crisp, and my friend's tacos were swimming in sauce. 
It wasn't a particular busy evening so I found the waitresses attitude and general demeanour uncalled for. 
I can't recommend this place unless you must eat and everything is closed."}
{"text":"A group of 4 of us were on a double date and was actually planning to go to another restaurant but was compelled by the nice ambience of this restaurant. This would soon prove to be a mistake.

For starters we got the tempura cauliflower and the duck pate. The tempura was just as it sounds - Nothing special. The duck pate came with a few pieces of cracker like toast which was much too hard for the stiff pate which would break when you try to spread it which is probably why they didn't bother to give us an adequate of toast to go with the pate.

3 of us had the Duck and Carbonara, 1 had the lamb and beans. Unfortunately we found it quite disappointing. The carbonara was slightly bland and the duck still had a lot of fat on it which should've been rendered longer. The lamb had an unusual smokey flavour which bordered to tasting burnt. Overall the meal itself wasn't that bad but for the price you pay, it's really not worth it. There are way better options.

Two of us didn't feel too good that evening and one of our friends ended up sick the day after. It could've just been a bad day in the kitchen or we just ordered the wrong items but we won't be going back to find out."}
{"text":"Closer to a 3.5 for me.
I came here with a couple of friends for lunch. Prices were good and the service was great! We did arrive at an off-peak time (11-11:30 AM), on a weekday, though. The place was nicely decorated, homey, and fairly small, so it filled up quickly by the time lunch rolled around. 

I got the Fried Chicken. I called it 'Fancy Popeyes'. It came with two large pieces of chicken, a small portion of mac n cheese, and a biscuit. See? Fancy popeyes! It was good, but nothing that really blew me away, or that I would get again. The fried chicken was.. you know, fried chicken. Tasted good to me. The mac n cheese had goat cheese in it, I believe, as I thought that I could taste it, but I can't remember if it was stated on the menu. However, the goat cheese that they used for it and for the mushroom, goat cheese flatbread dish, has a very, very mild flavour. So you want to try goat cheese? Go for it!!!! The biscuit also had a strong thyme flavour, which I didn't mind. 

Overall, not bad! I will be back because I didn't know that they served brunch only on the weekends. And brunch gives me life. Next time!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there on a Tuesday night and we were impressed! 

Pros:
Ahi tuna- so fresh, perfectly seared on the outside and green onion was a nice touch. 
Mac and cheese- to die for!! So cheesy and delicious
Steak- amazing Dijon dressing and cooked to perfection- beef quality was so-so cuz it was a bit tough. 
Service was fast and friendly

Cons:
Sat outside on the patio and it has a bit of a too close and awkward set up.
Steamed Green beans were a bit too salty and not worth $5 compared to the bar snacks. 

Will definitely be back and want to check out that brunch!"}
{"text":"I actually like this place, something about the din lights, natural earthly color decor, comfy couches and saloon doors that makes this place appealing.  Not to forget they also have a small outdoor patio at front which is a plus!
After walking around during Nuit Blanche 2015 our entourage decided to come here for some R&R for drinks.
Their drink menu isn't overwhelming that it'll take you hours to decide, however tonight I felt like BEER...though I'm a wine type of guy.
Few of us decided to order their \"Flight of Draught\" which gave you 3 type of beers on tap, Blonde, IPA, and dark for $8....which was not a bad choice at all. 
The place is chills, the staff are sweet and its a place where you can just totally kick if back with good company. 
I'd totally recommend if you're in the area, especially for after work drinks."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch with an old friend and its a cute place. *Protip* there's also $5 all day Sunday parking across the street so that made things much better! 

I got the Lobster Benedict and WOW. Like many of the other reviews, this place is serious about food! Presented beautifully and tastes beautifully, this tavern knows how to do brunch. The Kobe Burger is juicy and their fries are actually a mix of sweet potato and regular potato tater bits! 

The caesar could of been better.. But the food and service makes up for it. 

After our main dishes came out and me and my friend asked the server to move to another table, she was more than happy to help! (even I thought I was a bit annoying with that request...) 

Anyhoo, this place is an all star five. It's a gem, and perfect for a downtown brunch."}
{"text":"I went here, in a party of 4 for a casual birthday dinner a few days ago, made reservations because all the other reviews had mentioned that this place is small. If you want to go here, you should make reservations. 

Ambiance: The place is loud, they play loud music and the lighting is dark - likely to capture a \"tavern\" experience. It's a bit difficult to have a conversation with the person next to you when it fills up. The place is so small that it gets very noisy when there are more people. 

FOOD: 
beef cheek & smoked cheddar poutine - didn't taste the smoked cheddar and don't remember seeing any cheddar. There wasn't much gravy or sauce at all, it relies on the beef cheek for the sauce. The beef cheek itself was tasty. Fries are tasty but together it was only so-so. 

seared whitefish - cooked perfectly, dressing is light but it's just the right amount and it tasted pretty good. Only problem: portion was very small. My friend who ordered this, ended up eating the rest of the fries from another person's steak frites. 

duck confit carbonara - likely the best entree we've had here. the linguine is topped with a duck leg. The duck is cooked really well and has a nice smokey flavour to it. I would recommend this dish. (it also might be the only thing I would return for) 

steak frites - The small steak is over seared (similar to House of Chans). The sear gives the steak a hard outside - it's almost cooked to char, but the inside was medium rare as requested. It comes with a huge wad of fries, REALLY big portion of fries, that took up the whole plate. (these fries came in handy, as my still hungry friend who ordered the fish - devoured them). 

6oz kobe burger - Just a burger, nothing special. Couldn't really tell it's kobe beef.

tempura green beans - we ordered this because the waitress kept suggesting it, and said it was popular. I was hesitant because previous yelpers had mentioned that their tempura cauliflower wasn't very good. As you guessed it, neither was the tempura green beans. It's tempura batter to bean ratio was off by a lot - too much tempura batter and oil. Regret ordering this. 


Overall: The place is OK. Some of the dishes are good, but some are a bit disappointing. Once was enough for me."}
{"text":"Stopped by after watching a movie at the Scotiabank Movie Theater looking for some Pizza. Sure enough they had Deep Dish Pizza on their menu! Unfortunately it takes about 35-40 minutes to make and we were limited on time. So we decided to get some drinks (beer and wine) and tacos since it was Taco Tuesday. The tacos were well put together and had beautiful presentation, and it tasted better than it looked. At that moment I was in Mexican heaven. Cerveza and Tacos, I could not go wrong with that.

The Tavern by Trevor is a hidden gem as there are so many restaurants in the entertainment district. When I first stepped in it was quiet, and it was also a very dimmed area. It was probably because it was a Tuesday evening, but it was a great place to sit down and have uninterrupted conversations. One bad thing that about the Tavern was when I went to the washroom the whole area was freezing cold from the cold air coming from outside in the middle of winter. Besides that I was thoroughly impressed with the service and food of that establishment. I will be sure to stop by again to try their deep dish pizza. JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"Had the beef cheek and bacon sandwich, kobe slider, fries, garlic fried chicken and kale salad. 

Winner: garlic fried chicken. Crunchy, juicy dark meat chicken, almost like karaage. Order lots of these, skip the included sauce and enjoy.

Not Winners: everything else.

Beef cheek and bacon sandwich w/ kimchi and a fried gooey bread. The gooey bread was too gooey and both taste and texture clashed w/ everything else. The kimchi overpowered the beef cheek and bacon and the beef cheek itself was oddly underwhelming flavor-wise.

Kobe slider is cooked well. What's the point of offering it if you're gonna overcook it because of Ontario's draconian burger temperature laws. Seasoning was fine, but again, why overcook something like kobe beef.

Kale salad was lemony. That's about it.

Herbed fries were fine, nothing you couldn't get at Swiss Chalet or Burger King."}
{"text":"Do not be afraid to try out this new Tav near Richmond and Spadina.

It's small (aka not a lot of seating -- probably about 30-35 tops), but the food is MIGHTY.... that is to say MIGHTY GOOD.

Came here with a friend, we had the Beef Cheek and Bacon sandwich with Kimchi on top and shared an order of fries.

The sandwich was open faced and oh so yummy.  Pretty filling too -- not sure I would both with the fries next time.

We were watching orders go by and everything looked fab.

They have specials of the day and also special $10 deals (sandwich and a side).

Located right on the NE side of Richmond and Spadina, this is welcome addition to the 'hood.  

Be sure to check it out!

PS - you can get lunch in 1 hour for sure.  The place is also licensed for those that want a beer with their pub meal."}
{"text":"Drinks are cheap and good during happy hour until 7pm ($5), but the food is just average and WAY overpriced. Their cheeseboard is most definitely NOT worth $19, don't even think about wasting your money on this. The deep fried cauliflower is great, but I'd plan on this being a drinks before food kind of place."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch last weekend. The restaurant is pretty small and filled up quickly, so I definitely recommend getting reservations!

I ordered a bellini and their BLT. The sandwich was fantastic and I would absolutely get it again. Our server was also polite and attentive throughout the meal. The only issue I encountered was the bar didn't make my bellini when the order was first put in. When the server came back to check on us I told her I hadn't gotten my drink and to not worry about bringing it out. She returned shortly with my drink, said it was on the house, and apologized for the error, which I appreciated. Honestly, though, the drink wasn't that great and didn't seem worth the $11 it would have cost, so I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it, but I still wouldn't order it again.

Overall it was a very good experience and I will happily come back in the future!"}
{"text":"The dynamic duo of Trevor and Mike are more Bevis and Butthead than Batman and Robin.

Wilted lettuce, raw chicken, running out of one of only three entrees after I ordered it and no apology for anything puts me in  villainous mood...enter evil laugh."}
{"text":"This is your grub bar to hang out with friends. Basic bar food with cheap drinks and good music. The location is convenient too. Oil, grease and fatty foods are what comes to mind when I think of this place."}
{"text":"Went there for a drink on a random Wed night. They do play sports like baseball at two TVs at the bar. 

It was almost empty and the service was good (only one waitress around 9 pm on a Wed night) but she seemed to be able to manage. BUT, she did inform us that the kitchen was CLOSED! So no late bites here. 

The ambience at night was cool as other Yelpers photos show with vintage-looking hanging light fixtures with Edison bulbs (I love that look). 

Two person tables as well as a couple of booths and larger tables to fit parties of 6. 

I didn't try the food but their beer and wine options seemed acceptable. I like the location. I hope it does well. 

I would suggest that they have a chalkboard with their specials to tempt people to nibble while they drink (if they get there while the kitchen is open)."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a friend at 11:00pm. It was during happy hour so all drinks under the bottle label are 5$

Food: my friend n i shared the mozarella sticks, poutine with beef n yellow bell peppers, and beef sliders. All in all the food was delicious n a good spread to share between 2 ppl.

Venue: its a decent sized place with 2 booths a bar, a few tables, and a small patio.  

Price: the price is fair for the after hours menu as well as the good selection of beer (i had a beer that tasted like grapefruit/lychee while my friend had one that gad the taste of cider)

Service: it was good but the place wasnt filled to the brim. Our waitress checked on us from time to time and was polite and friendly.

Final thoughts: decent place to visit at night, decent selection of beers and food choices. Would go back to try a different kind of beer with friends."}
{"text":"I came here today for the first time with a friend for lunch and was happy with the food but dismayed by the service. 

We arrived close to 1pm and the server let us seat ourselves so we chose a booth near the back as it wasn't busy or full yet. We waited a long time for someone to acknowledge us and were ready to order by the time the waitress came to check on us. She asked for drink orders so I got a negroni flip and my friend an old fashioned. Eventually, what looked like the manager put empty glasses on our table with no water. I noticed that she walked back and forth from our table and very obviously looked at our empty glasses but did not bother to fill them until we asked...We were a bit perplexed by that. Our drinks took a long time and we ordered our food before they arrived at our table. I wasn't too hungry and ordered the panko roasted cauliflower and my friend the tuna steak and tomato soup. Finally our drinks came and while it's hard to screw up an old fashioned, I did not enjoy my negroni flip at all. I was expecting a light and frothy drink (attributed to the egg white shaken into it) but it was flat, sickeningly sweet, and not at all herby and fragrant as I know them to be. I know the sweet vermouth and the simple syrup make it sweet but it was very unpleasant and very one-dimensional. It was drinkable, but barely...Halfway through, it started to have a bit of smell like dirty dishwater (maybe due to the egg white?) which was very unpleasant but I was paying $11 for it so I drank it. But terrible drink aside, the food was fantastic (albeit slow). My order wasn't anything fancy but it was really tasty and a good-sized portion for only $5. My friend's food looked great, though! 

If it hadn't been for the extremely slow and almost negligent service (though they were nice enough), I would have given this place 4 stars but with the crappy cocktail, it really only deserved 3. The food was top notch so I hope it was just an off-day for service and it will be better if/when I come back."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place since it opened, but finally made it over last night when I found out that they have half priced bottles of wine on Wednesday nights from 5-8.

My friend and I shared our dishes and were pretty happy with our choices.  We had:

Tuna carpaccio - this was melt in your mouth delicious.  It was drizzled in some kind of mayo.  I wish there were a few more flavours incorporated, but overall it was really good.

Tempura cauliflower - who doesn't like fried cauliflower?  The inside was soft yet still firm, there was a touch of lemon somewhere, and wasn't too greasy.

Sweet potato and black bean potage - Great vegetarian option, flavourful, and filling.  The cornbread muffin was decent as well.  I found it a little pricey at $13.

Beef and Bison Tourtiere - probably the most disappointing of the dishes which was unfortunate since I had heard many great things about it online.  The crust was slightly over baked and the crust to filling ratio was too high.  The inside was not hot so we asked that it be heated more.  The filling was also kind of dry.  A little smear of apple sauce on the plate didn't do it justice, it needed gravy or something.  Wouldn't bother with it again.

All in all I was satisfied and I'm sure I'll be returning - next time maybe for their amazing looking brunch menu."}
{"text":"Was rather impressed with this little place on spadina off of Richmond.

We brought some clients here and while it wasn't busy the service was great and the ambiance nice as well.  It was a bit loud with only two tables (a boisterous group was beside us) but you have to expect lots of noise in a small place in this area.

Our food was really good and no complaints from anybody.  I had fish and chips and have vowed to never buy fish and chips from a non seafood or specialty fish and chips place but the quality was great on the food here. 

What impressed me the most were the specials and creative combos with low pricing - case in point, burger, fries and pint for $15. How can you pass that up? 

Also the appetizers were all $5 each - had a plate of Kung pao chicken bites and while it wasn't gigantic, for $5, wow what a great deal.  I'll definitely come back.

Also had a few Caesars which were amazing - a meal in and of itself with bacon, olives, beans, asparagus.

Oh and half priced bottles of wine on Wednesday's I think - don't quote me on that but I'm pretty sure ;)"}
{"text":"Has anyone watched Restaurant Makeover show or Restaurant Impossible when Gordon Ramsey discover restaurant owners use one week old meat to DEEP Fry to \"refresh\" , speeding up , or cover up the stale meats? N u think this won't happen in downtown ? This happens to me today n I have to say so far his is the worst dish I have had last 10 years not only the smell of oil fry was overwhelming , also the taste  was making me gage evey time it touched my tougue! I even confronted the chef about his Frying method , guess what he did NOT deny it! 

Many many famouse celebrity chefs said: common restaurant secret is restaurant specials n discounted food r days old food going to spoil n they r trying t get rid off. So NEVER order em!!! I didn't listen n this what happened ! 

The place had THICK Fog of oil , was unbearable as we were walking in even the door was wide open! It should have been red flag that they deep fry everything u order! Imagine u have tinny kitchen n u fry everything in deep fryer n searing meat without the ventilation. I had NEVER been to a restaurant in Toronto that walking in had fog of oil n smelt like fryer. 

Sunday eve, the daily manu (printed on piece of paper) at button section were the main dishes for 50% off . When I saw the \"blacken ribs \" I realized it is amazing deal I couldn't miss! The food took bit longer to come which was okay . When it came the piece meat was massive ! I was so impressed ! Until the very first bite. When I open the ribs my hand touched the texture it was unexpectedly tough like HARD tough ! I figure it might happen since the outside is hard n blackened. When I reached for the first bite the SMELL of OIL was soooooo bad mixed with some odd foul flavour! ----- have u ever had piece of fried chicken n it happens to be dark meat n smelt very very very bad! Or have u ever had a chicken wing that is over fried that all the water was drained n the meat shrunk to tough n rubbery texture while the white/pinkish meat looking transparent(OVER FRIED IN DEEP FRIER)?Mean while the texture consisted tough beef jerky smelt like the gross dark chicken meat x10 and drumsticks out of frier!   I can't exactly describe the taste with words. I guess I can say \"throwing up in my mouth\" n my puppies dog chicken jerkies smelt Freshier than these(actually was like that). The ppl out there who don't eat pork , just imagine eating an precooked one week old chicken wing that has been re fried to make it taste fresh except way over fried it n it was piece of hard transparent rock with oil spilling out of meat and bones!!! N smelt so strong !! 

My bf didn't take the plunge to get 50% off food , he had the non special item which was burger from full price menu. He loved loved loved it. It looked very nice a juicy too. They obviously only use bad meats for the \"special menu\". So that also explains other ppl did have great experience with their \"amazing food\"! 

I force swallowed about 1 or two small bites. As I chew the rough surface of the rubbery meat . The oil just spells out n even felt more gross the more I chew it. N ever mentioned when I had was complete piece of lean meat. When u cool ribs the oil r usually burned off or fell out, outside is fat inside is juicy or tender. When my ribs SMELT exactly as my fries n u saw the transparent outter layer of meat. U know he DID NOT COOK my ribs. He put that meat in the FRIER n over fried it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I went to talk to the chef his name was Colin. I politely told him that my food was fried , the Color was see thru like piece of hard plastic or glass. N the texture was tough like dried cured meats n tasted all oil. He did not deny he fry it at all to my surprise n he actually apologized n said :\" it's okay it's not your fault.\" There is another Person at back with long silver hair (man), not sure who cooked my ribs.

I brought the bones n some meat home to feed my puppy because beef or pork bones r very good since they don't shred n the dog wont chock on shredded bones. They would just try to chew the ends n grind their teeth nib at em. Guess what!!! I kept hearing loud cracking noise aft 5th cracking noise i rushed to stop my puppy . As I picked up the bone i realized the deep oil from deep frier penetrated the bones deep. The bones were fried inside out also not just the meat! I had to toss the bone immediately. 

MAKE SURE check out my photos to see the meats! 

So if u go to this place make sure Oder non on discounted non special menu! From previous reviews! A group of ppl all got sick from eating at this place , obviously they use old restaurant trick to get rid of stale meats. It's pretty appalling considering its Trever's sister restaurant.  

On my way home my bf offered to buy me any food I want so I can get some food in but I couldn't eat anything else aft d 2 bites. I was completely grossed out! C d  pics, the parts looked see thru r NOT fat, but deep fried lean meat infused in oil in frier"}
{"text":"It was fine- we accidentally came on opening day after a brutal workout so we were starving and hunting for a place to eat at, and fast. Our waitress was super nervous but cute and tried really hard. They didn't have some of the ingredients featured on their menu available- no anchovies for their caesar salad for example and one or two things weren't available on the menu. My soda water was flat and served to me in a can.  The tomato soup was yummy and my boyfriend's salad was full of veggies and protein- mmm! However, if it's my first day on the market, I'd want to make a stellar impression and be more prepared. Bathroom is also super creepy and you need a key for it. 

I also find it super odd that it's \"by Trevor\". Who is \"Trevor\"? It's a tavern- which by definition isn't supposed to be that pretentious. Kind of an oddball place but once they get everything sorted out and running smoothly, I wouldn't mind going back."}
{"text":"If this place was in NYC, I would have been fine with it. The space was cramped. Service was slow and unfriendly. It was really loud. The bathroom was in another building and involved a convoluted key situation. The food was overpriced and meh.

Only we're in Toronto, not NYC, which means there are better bar options."}
{"text":"My friends and I happened to stumble into this hidden jewel on Spadina Ave in Toronto.  I laugh at that statement because we stumbled into the place and we were stumbling out of it after we went there.  It was during happy hour on a weekend and the place was nowhere near as crowded as I imagined it would be.  The place is a good size but I guess when more patrons come it might get crowded but luckily during our visit that was not an issue.

The ambiance of the place is traditional tavern.  The quintessential long bar where the libations reside, exposed brick walls, and dark brown furniture to let guests know that this place means business are all present.  You can take your fancy auburn woodwork somewhere else.  Then add a little tea light candle to set the mood and I felt like I was in another country.  Oh wait I was.  And man did I appreciate mingling with the local Canucks.

The server was fantastic and her recommendations were right on.  The bartender knew how to make my friends and I feel welcome and I even took a selfie with her and the server.  They even gave us tips on what to do in the area afterwards which really helped considering we would be popping out of the tavern after a happy hour stint and you know what that means!

We ordered drinks which I care not to recall but the food I do remember.  Mainly because I was smart enough to take a picture of the menu BEFORE the drinks arrived (haha win!)  We shared the tempura cauliflower, chick peas fritter, beef cheek and smoke cheddar poutine, mozzarella sticks, and for some sweet tooth satisfaction had the Nutella cream filled beignets.  Man Canadians have the whole poutine thing down to a science.  When I say that my favorite dish was the beef cheek and cheddar poutine it was because I could have eaten three bowls worth of it all at once.  I mean come on it's super tender beef cheeks on top of fries drenched with smoked cheddar and a smidgen of pickled peppers to add the extra zing that elevates the dish to what it is.  The tempura cauliflower was the dark horse with it's flavorful punch that made me like cauliflowers!  The chick peas fritter and mozzarella sticks were the typical fried finger foods and the Nutella beignets finished the meal on such a delicious note I couldn't help but lick my fingers clean of the extra Nutella that made it's way to it.

If you are ever on this part of town while visiting Toronto please stop by.  The Tavern by Trevor is a gem of a find.  I found it worthwhile to visit and would do so again if I'm ever back in the area."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group of friends at 12am on a Saturday night and was one of the only groups in the bar. Last call was at 1:30am so we expected there to be a crowd there, and was actually disappointed that there was only 2 other small tables at the bar.

The bartender was great with her stories and really accommodating. The mixed drinks were really diluted and not that great though.  I would only suggest going to the bar with good company."}
{"text":"I've been to this place 4 or 5 times and on each visit, they are \"out of\" an item on the menu or on the wine list. Today, I visited with a friend who had just lost her job, and they had ONE red wine available - a Niagara wine that was cheap and sour.  The menu was extremely limited. The food was absolutely disgusting - spicy, greasy and un-edible,  but we were too polite to protest. 

The owners/chef should be ashamed. I'd give it zero stars, but that is not an option."}
