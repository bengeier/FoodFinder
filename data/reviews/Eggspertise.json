{"text":"The place is really pretty & clean. The staff is kind. I got half a waffle and it was delicious. I'm giving 4 stars because I've only been once."}
{"text":"This was our second visit. Showed up Sunday noon. This place is known for its good food. I ordered a lunch sandwich while my guests had brunch. We had a new waitress. Service was slow. they really are crowded. One table left because it took too long. The food was good but it took so long that it was served cold. The food is usually good and hot. Good selection and tasty options. Reasonable priced with parking across he street. We'll come back to give them another chance. I did notice that there is no management. One of the cooks runs the show. Probably the owner. The young hostesses try to help but can't make the tough decisions. The decisions come from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Bon Resto à dejeuner!!! Assiettes très généreuses!!! J'ai mangé l'assiette gaufre Elvis et ufs et c'était décadent!!!!!!
Le seul bémol est le service qui est juste ok.... Je crois qu'il était short staff car les serveuses couraient un peu à droite et à gauche et nous n'avons pas reçu notre assiette en même temps à ma table. 

Mais ça valait la peine car mon assiette était debilement bonne!!!"}
