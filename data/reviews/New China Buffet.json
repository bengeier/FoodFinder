{"text":"Very cheap, free drinks and friendly service. Good place to dine in if your hungry for some Chinese :)"}
{"text":"Very clean, airy, open dining area, with large sunny windows and lots of space. 

Many, many dishes to choose from, including salad, sushi (nothing to write home about, though, on the sushi), soups, and the usual Chinese food dishes. They also had some unusual dishes, probably geared toward the American palate, such as cheese wontons and stuffed puffy pastry thingies.

The only negatives I can really mention are the soups are uncovered, and I could not bring myself to have a bowl, as much as I wanted to, because all I could envision was some nasty customer coughing and that cough landing in the soup. Also, there are no paper towels in the restroom and it would be nice to be able to use a paper towel to open the restroom doors. (There are two doors separating the dining room and restroom.) Lastly, the soft serve ice cream is more like ice milk - not sure if they are using the cheapest mix out there to save a dollar, but the stuff is really kind of nasty, frankly. 

As compared to another Chinese food buffet I recently reviewed, this place is MUCH, MUCH better, and about the same price. New China Buffet has many dishes, with each one having its own flavor, as opposed to that other Chinese food buffet I reviewed about a month ago where every dish tasted the same. New China Buffet's foods are fresh, not overcooked, and have good flavor, each unique to itself.

All in all, you can't ask for a better buffet for the price, and the place is very clean, the food was decent, and the staff was very friendly and helpful, without being obtrusive. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Today I went to this buffet. I use to live close to this restaurant several years ago and at that time it was one of my favorites. I have to say that I was very disappointed with the food this time. 

The selection of food wasn't as good as I remember. They didn't have as many shrimp dishes. Some of the food looked like it took a serious downgrade. I did love the egg foo yong. 

Service is decent enough. The food is alright for the low price. Though it isn't great it is a nice change from the regular fast food places."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING this joint is a low class filthy place. This place makes me want to never eat in another buffet ever again it's hot as hell in here I am digested of the floors and tables. Wish I can rate lower"}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Food is cold and could tell it had been sitting out for a while. No wonder it's so dead. 
Don't have a child on staff if he is going to a smart mouth."}
{"text":"The servers do not speak a word of English, and do not tell you the price until after you've eaten. We ended up paying over $17 for two people with just water to drink. The egg drop soup was terrible, the orange chicken was questionable, the rice and noodles were mediocre, and the skewered chicken must have been 50% fat. Frozen peas and carrots were generously thrown into everything, including the egg-drop soup... They also had zero sushi to offer. The selection was VERY limited. There are numerous superior asian buffets to this one in the area. Their only saving graces were their seafood and real ice cream, of which 6 flavors were available. So unless all you want is shrimp and ice cream, don't waste your time and money. 2/5"}
{"text":"As of August 31, this place is resurrected as Lee's Buffet after being closed for more than eight months.  It's been considerably renovated and there's a greater number of items available.  The prices are a bit higher, but soft drinks are now included.  The people running it are the same and their approach to cookery is the same.  If you liked it before, you'll like it now; and if not, not.  I live right nearby, so I regard it as a useful neighborhood resource."}
{"text":"As of this writing this location is still closed, with the LEES restaurant /buffet coming soon.
When opened it wasnt the best but not that bad for a slimey area location."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall from the outside, extensive buffet with very fresh food on the inside.
Cautiously approached this one and was pleasantly surprised.  It was clean, well-stocked with about 2/3 prefab and about 1/3 home crafted (appearing and tasting) dishes.  Fresh vegetables, one whole table of desserts and fruits, lots of fresh looking and tasting seafood, a spread not seen at neighboring buffets.  Imagine there must be seasonal flair as it seems experiences have varied here.  It is full-on summer but did not see all the plentiful ice cream buckets.  Did see a soft serve machine with several flavors but by then had already filled up on shrimp, noodles, watermelon,  pineapple, pudding, chicken, fish, rice, soup, egg rolls, etc, ate a lot!  
Yummy for the price.  Regarding the neighborhood - select diners create a unique ambiance, entertainment value included in meal.  Seems a lot of folks coming in for take-out, several regular diners as well.  During my stay several of the dishes were replaced even when half full, seemed to be on a time rotation for freshness.
Great crab puffs and salad dishes too.  Will probably go back again sometime."}
{"text":"I have been to this buffett once.  I am not sure if the restaurant is always that dirty or if I came after a big rush.  As for the food, it was mediocre at best.  One thing I did enjoy quite a bit was the crab rangoon.  However, the meal as a whole was not even close to great."}
{"text":"Not too bad.  A little bit of a hole-in-the-wall Chinese buffet. Reasonably priced. I got it to go and took it back to my room at the Embassy Suites."}
{"text":"This place is a little dirty,the food was not all that,the service wasn't good..save your money and go down the street to Asia buffet on Flamingo and eastern...way better......"}
{"text":"Got a decent variety, the low mien is pretty good but the wontons are OFF THE CHAIN!!! Obsessed with this restaurants wontons!"}
{"text":"Decent selection, everything was hot and tasty, not over salted like some I've been to. The crab Rangoon was really good, and the orange chicken and  lo mein noodles were on point. It was clean and approachable, I'd go back, plus they have soft serve to top off your trip. (Cones too)!"}
{"text":"This was the worst Chinese restaurant I have ever eaten at.  The food tasted terrible and the serving utensils were disgusting.  The egg drop soup ladle was caked over and had a layer of old soup stuck to it.  The orange chicken was hard and looked as though it had been sitting for a while. And even the ice cream was off with its consistency."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely the worst Chinese Buffet I have ever visited.  Very dirty.  Lots of empty selection trays on the steam tables that were never filled contrary to their advertisement of \"over 100 items to choose from.\"  They must have stolen the picture on their advertisement from another buffet because this wasn't even close.  SKIP THIS PLACE!  Not worth the potential visit to the ER."}
{"text":"Over the years I have dined at many cheap low end Chinese buffets. This is easily the worst.  

Their sign says they have something like 150 (I don't remember exactly) items. I don't see the point of having so many items when stray dogs wouldn't even eat this food."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place for 15 months, but finally I decided to stop in. Boy, do I regret waiting so long. The for was hot and fresh. It has a small, but varied selection. Actual Chinese food, not just variations on American food. 

The eating areas are clean and pleasing. The restroom stank like there was an open p-trap. I'm not eating in the restrooms, nor do I usually use public restrooms, but it was my observation for this visit.

Overall, I recommend it, just don't judge them by the restrooms."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! They have things a normal Chinese restaurant would have!! It has clams, frog legs, chicken drumsticks, and even alot of Chinese food!"}
{"text":"tables and chairs clean
food average - no puking
weird ass soft rock songs"}
{"text":"Very disappointed !! Food was very dry,  Spring rolls were hard a rocks. imitation crab was dried out. Shirmps were mushy....all in all I will not go there again."}
{"text":"Well when Rand H and myself pulled into the parking lot of this place i said to Rand i bet this is 3 star at best.Well upon entering this place i was already thinking this could be 4 or 5 star.The decor was alright and the buffet was big about 75 items all of which looked tasty .A couple of dishes that stood out from your typical chinese buffets were the japanese chicken ,lye chee pork ,stuffed crab balls on the half shell
and some kind of white fish that was pretty good but not labeled.the crab meat was real and there was plenty of shrimp dishes.all in all every thing i ate was good.Now on to desert (yay real ice cream) served with hot apple pie that was good but the rest of the deserts were just average. i forgot to have a chinese donut but they were there I love those and always try at least one so i guess i will be back"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with Robyn N. Jeromy H. and Rand H, Well for starters almost everything at the buffet was room temp. The food was not bad but would have been better hot.The soft serve ice cream was a real watery type. Any way dont waste your time here there is better across the street."}
{"text":"Price for the quality of the food is wayyy to high. I would say $7.00 for dinner would be more reasonable. Variety and quality in this buffet is not what to look for, nor for the price. They could use a remodeling of the decor inside."}
{"text":"The food was good for a buffet, price was right and included the drink. Staff is okay, $8 and some change for lunch. No prices posted. The bathroom was horrible and smelled like a sewage plant. Not bad for lunch, probably would go back."}
{"text":"Out of the four buffet tables none were hot. I will say one of those were cold food so that one was perfect. The rest literally was cold chicken everywhere! Not sure how anyone gave this place a five star review! But if you don't want flavor this is the place to come. Everything is one flavor even the Ice cream taste like everything else. Me and a few friends came here looking at the other reviews on how amazing it was but negative they have to pay people for those reviews. You couldn't pay me to eat here again. But 10 bucks is really cheap so it's a great price for all you can eat cold food! Seriously the drinks are what you pay for! The chocolate icecream my friends had was tangy and spicy. We are all still hungry and none of us ate anything we got. We sampled everything. The rice is amazing!!!!! So great!!! But for people to say this place is a five star dining you my friend are on some good meth!!!
Anyways no more ranting this place just sucks and do not try the sea food you will get slime all over you!!!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive at $8.99 for dinner.  We went on Christmas night and the food was pretty bad overall but some of the items were good:  fried chicken wings, bok choy, shrimp, daikon/beef soup, and the soft ice cream machine.  I thought the waitresses were efficient at taking the plates, too.

What can you expect for $8.99 dinner?  It's just mass quantities of biomatter when you come down to it!"}
{"text":"My mother used to eat here all of the time until her medical emergency. This place is pretty much a below average Chinese buffet. I wasn't too impressed with the selection and the quality was definitely sub-par,

The facts:

Pros:

1.  Easy to find off of 24th Street in Phoenix. It obviously used to be some sort of fast food place.

2.  Plenty of parking in general.

3.  The dinner buffet was $8.75 which is cheap considering what other buffets might charge.

4.  The selection is pretty decent but very heavy on chicken oriented dishes.

Cons:

1.  A little too salty on most of it's food. As I stated, they are very heavy on chicken oriented dishes.

2.  I just don't think jello belongs in a buffet. It's a cheap option to maximize profit. Not very impressed by red and green jello.

3.  The egg rolls were pretty bad. Yes they were crunchy on the outside but felt undercooked on the inside. That means soggy, which isn't a good thing.

This would be a good choice after a drunken stupor evening when it doesn't matter what you put in your stomach. As for a choice, I would most likely avoid this place."}
{"text":"9 gals went there for a Birthday Party. I wished someone would have searched this site for comments.  As others have said, it was GROSS from the minute we walked in.  Sticky  and dirty floors.  We asked to be seated in the area behind the cashier.  Almost every chair was ripped and torn. We had to find some that weren't ripped to place the ones that was there.  As I pulled out the chair, my hands stuck to the back of the chair. The table was also sticky. I had to put a napkin down before my plate so it wouldn't stick. 
I passed Sanitizing lotion around to the others.  Food was ok. The cold dishes was about 2\" off the ice. Hot foods were warm.  My friend and I will never go back. I wonder why the Health Dept hasn't made a visit. The whole place needs to be redone and  deep cleaned from top to bottom!"}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be so much better. I give 3 stars provisionally based on my first vist. Food was cold and not as good as it could be. Perhaps it was because I came at an off time. Could be great but for now so-so at best."}
{"text":"Been a regular here before they relocated or re opened. Over the past couple years the quality continues to drop along with the staff getting more and more less customer friendly.  Now they dropped to a level of serving brown soda water as    Pop & the past two times i mentioned soda needs syrup they just walk away.  Come on i know your a $4-8 buffet but quality, friendliness & cleanliness is still vital to keep the public diner in your arena."}
{"text":"I do not recommended this place. All the food was cooked in rancid oil. We didn't even finish our dinner. We left and went to McDonald's."}
{"text":"For the price, this is probably the best buffet I have ever been to in Arizona. Great selection with all that sea food. For 10 dollars lunch, there is NO way you can have this quality and quantity anywhere else. I absolutely recommend this joint!"}
{"text":"Borderline OK only if you're in a pinch and short on cash but that's about it. Definitely many better choices out there."}
{"text":"Mmmhhhh... It was okay.  The orange chicken was good; everything else is better at Hunan VIII across the street."}
{"text":"Uuugh bathrooms were sticky with piss and it smelled like a petstore. just think.. if thats how they keep the part of the resturaunt people DO see, what doe the kitchen look like???  food was lackluster service was ok. the maitre d seemed like pissed off to be there. maybe cause she couldn't peep without catching birdflu? i dunno, im not a doctor."}
{"text":"This was a good place to eat it was clean and the staff was on time and diligent with their work. The food was hot in that tried out to people can eat there for 20 bucks. Typical American Chinese food this was our first time here and we will be back."}
{"text":"This first paragraph is a 1 to 2 starness......
Well for starters they had empty trays, and the empty trays were the hottest ones that is there was steam coming off of them. In other words most of the food was cold. This place must've been severely understaffed because they didn't get the plates off our table till long after we'd gotten another. They were letting the food trays run empty for 10 and 15 minutes at a time.

This second paragraph is the 3 to 4 starness......
the food may have been cold but some of it was very good, in that the spicing was done correctly. Often Chinese buffets spicy dishes are not quite as spicy as they need to be in my book to be called spicy. The price was good and the drink was included but that's not enough to make up for all the inequities. It was pretty much unanimous at the time we left our little UYE Rand H. Mike C. Robyn N and myself all agreed and said in the parking lot as we left two stars. Rand H. upon further contemplation came to one star. And only because some of the food was fairly good did I stay at two stars. I hope they get it right, but I won't be going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm really trying to still like this place.  Quality of food is going down. The wonton soup needs flavor! And for God sake get a soft serve ice cream machine, those buckets really? I still enjoy my favorites but hard to feel comfortable when staff is so rude. I swear if they don't like you for whatever reason you get fish tank water."}
{"text":"Great food selection! Family friendly. Loved the deep fried ginger crab! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"If it is a fried food than you will find it here.

I went here after some convincing from some co workers. Yes, it is in an old pizza hut. Yes there was a used condom in the parking lot, and yes the garbage truck drivers seem to frequent this place.

For the low price of $7 with a drink access to a buffet full of random \"delights\" 

There is a salad side, with some salad that I have yet to see any one touch and macaroons, not Chinese last I checked but they have them near the salad.

The center buffet area is the fried foods annex. Greasy egg rolls, uncross and greasy cream cheese puffs, fried bananas, French fries, dough nuts, fried fish and even pizza. None of them are stellar, most are even below bar.

Another row contains the Chinese foods. The vegetarian options are limited to a mass of bean sprouts, veggie lomein noodles and the rices. 

Finally, there is the desert area, full of jellos and pineapple cubes, and pudding, and of course fortune cookies.
I was also a bit disappointed that they re use siriacha sauce bottles for other sauces, as I would love to have siriacha with any food.

While the eclectic mix of food is comical, the overall result is just mass quantities of subpar food. 

If you are starving and need to raise your cholesterol, a few points this place may be for you. If you like quality look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Terrible just terrible do not come here I'm shocked that this place hasn't been shut down for good"}
{"text":"Gross,gross,gross. If You want stale microwaved food in a sticky floor dungeon, this is your place. Nice people. Disgusting food."}
{"text":"My husband's parents picked this place so we met here for family dinner.  It was a Sunday night and there wasn't a wait but when we went in there was a kid about 10ish working the register and then cleaning tables and picking up plates.  I didn't think that was right and seemed odd.  The buffet was kinda small and a lot of the pans were bare.  It seemed like most of the food out wasn't even Chinese at all and of what was out, it was just kinda meh.  If going off the food then I would only expect to it to cost somewhere in the $3-$5 range.  Not to say the prices were bad, but they are comparable to most of the other buffets with either more of a selection or better food.
At least the restaurant was filthy looking but there was lots of food/trash on the floor.
If I had to go back, I would only end up getting the ice cream which is scooped out of ice cream containers and doesn't come out of a machine."}
{"text":"We have gone to Hunan VIII for a while now on the regular (every Wednesday), so we decided one week to try the place across the street. I wish I could get that meal back. It was too packed, too dirty, and too greasy. There was food all over the ground. We even had to wipe down the seats, table, and high chair. The tables were too mashed up close to each other, that it even felt like a clown car. 

Besides all of the ridiculousness mentioned above, as we walked in and out we were annoyed by a couple guys selling rosaries and candles outside of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Gross gross and gross. This is a terrible place to get food from. We drove from LA and stopped for lunch here and regretted every second of it. Like others have said trays were empty and everything looked so dirty. This is probably the worst buffet I've been too and that 7.33 price is definitely not worth it. So take my advice and don't stop here ever."}
{"text":"Well everyone I will have to agree with all of you. I have come here twice once because I was invited, second was today because my mother liked it. But to me I could taste the difference between everything... everything tasted the same! Cheap, but not so good. When I have been there both times it has been clean. The service was there, but when would I need them, except for refiel right? The only things I really did like was the sweets thats all. But everything else after your done eating you can't really taste a distinct taste.  But yea save your money, this is the last time i am going next time I am taking her to another buffet, like new Asia Buffet I hear thats good. Well, the thing That I really do not like from there is the entrance. That blasted creeking door annoys me!

That and today I found a bee in the window next to where I was eating, good thing I killed it before it stung anyone. Plus... In the bathroom there was a mans genitals drawn there LOL. Just please everyone just pass this place and save your money."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. Great food selection and friendly staff. Love the dessert selection too. Hot and delicious food. What more can you ask."}
{"text":"This place needs negative stars! The only good thing I have to say about it is that after argueing with the cashier, we finally got our money back and were able to go somewhere else to eat. Both my husband and I were not happy about the thought of paying $18 to leave still hungry.   I wanted to like New China, but the food was all cold, either tasteless or tasted spoiled, I couldn't find someone to get me water to drink and some things tasted spoiled.  I spit more food into napkins than I ate and finally, after going back to the buffet to try a few different items (all equally disappointing and spit into napkins) I went to the cashier and asked to speak to the manager.  she asked to see my receipt and then proceeded to argue that we'd been there for 20 min. and obviously had eaten something and claimed that in the 13 yrs of their business no one had ever complained! Seriously??? After showing her our plates with rejected food and napkins filled with garbage, reluctantly, she refunded our money.  My advice to diners is to go somewhere else. I should have read these yelp reviews before trying new restaurants.  We had a burger and fries at Five Guys..they never let us down!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Food all tasted the same. Nothing unique or different. Everything tasted like they just heated it up after being frozen for months. The service is great, it's the food that isn't."}
{"text":"Cheap buffet. That's about the only positive. Nothing really tasted good. Everything tasted old and reheated multiple times."}
{"text":"I should have listened to the reviews. It had so many one star reviews I figured I just HAD to try it, you know? No place can still be in business after so many shitty reviews, right?

It's horrible. Horrible. Seriously, this was terrible."}
{"text":"save your time and money. dont go here. the food is nasty. everything tastes the same as if they cook everything in the same oil or pot. alot of the food was cold too. anything that was hot was too hot and i burnt myself from the steam rising from the warmers under the food trays. 
the mens restroom was worse. urinals were overflowing and the toilet was backed up. o yea it smelled like sh** all the way out to the dining area. our server was good though. she came by every 10 minutes to make sure we were ok."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the prices are great, and I'm sure you'll find something you like...it's just that I've never seen food replicated so many times under so many different names. 

The sesame, orange, and honey chicken all taste almost exactly the same. So do the...like, three varieties of terriyaki chicken. One time, I'd shown up, and there were items that didn't even have descriptions. I just tried to guess based on appearance. 

It's also severely bland, for the most part. I feel as though every single item could benefit from a clove of garlic or something. That being said, it's super cheap to-go, very clean, and if you fancy dining in, the interior is actually quite nice. I don't really wanna endorse uncreative Chinese food, but who am I kidding? I'll probably come back when I'm feeling super lazy."}
{"text":"Just placed an order to pickup and it was nasty.  Tasted like fried fat.  We ordered 3 items and split them all between three people.  Two of the items were inedible by all three of us and ended up going to the dogs.  Chicken nuggets from fast food would be better than the 3rd item.  I remember ordering from here when they first opened and liking it but have not been here in 5 years since we saw they failed a couple health inspections.  Won't be eating from here again as there was nothing we ate that made us want to return.  $30.00 for dog food this trip, not happy."}
{"text":"This place must be kidding...

The hubby & I decided to try it out after coming across their add in the paper that boasted about they're \"Hundreds of Items\"...not! We got there and the place didn't even smell right. It looked like an old run down Hometown Buffet. Against my better judgment, I went to get a plate. There were tons of empty trays and theyre food looked very questionable. The chicken-on-a-stick looked \"off\", kinda stringy looking if that makes sense. The employees looked as if they were working against their will...weird. Not to mention they collect all the used dishes etc in an old cracked storage tote on a rolling cart.  When my hubby came back to the table with his food we looked at eachother for a moment and agreed we couldnt even take a bite. We both decided to take a trip to the restroom before we left, big mistake. It smelled like a porta-potty before we even walked down the hallway...and don't get me started on the actual bathroom. We ended up leaving without even touching our food or drink and wouldnt go back if they paid me. Contemplated contacting the health department, yes, it was that bad."}
{"text":"Food was cold and the fruit bad I asked for my money back and they took out for the drinks"}
{"text":"Went in the afternoon around 2. We walked in and the woman told us to sit down. It was dead silent except for the baby screaming and the loud music from a boy's cell phone on the other side of the restaurant.

We walked up to the table to get our food, and everything looked old and stale. They had a birthday cake with half of the frosting missing. The ragoons were cold and stale. The rice and chicken were relatively good, however.

The whole time we were filling our plates, a man working there would stare at us. When we sat down he would sit down or go in the back, and every time we got back up, he would come and examine us as we got our food. It was very uncomfortable.

Also, the carpeting has snags and rips in it; very easy to trip over. The booth we sat in had rips in the seats as well. 

It was $16 for me and my friend in the end. I don't plan on coming back here any time soon."}
{"text":"Went here a second time after the first was fantastic. Definitely a disappointment. No fresh food out at all and nothing tasted good either."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!!  THEY ARE STEALING YOUR MONEY!!!  Not only should the board of health shut this vile place down (and I am almost embarrassed to write this which means I actually went there) due to the food they are serving having major issues, but they are still charging 9.05% sales tax!!!!  The stated dropped the 1% extra on 3/31/13, so this place has been charging its customers that extra 1% for almost 1.5 years!!!   

so to the place:  the booths are all torn, the floor needs a massive cleaning, chinese mustard should not be brown, oily and look like fecal matter from a dog!!!

How are placing like this ALLOWED to be open???"}
{"text":"We come from Ashtabula often just to come here. We aren't really into Buffets but this is the best Chinese ever. The food is always so delicious. There is never not a time that it isn't busy there. The prices are great. I've never had a bad experience. I recommend it to everyone. A lot of people I know love it also. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is a long time favorite. We have been coming here for about 10+years. They have a great variety of food: shrimp a few different ways, fish, honey sesame chicken, beef & broccoli, chicken, hot wings, lo mein, pizza, chicken nuggets, salad fresh fruit, jello, ice cream and so much more- overall the food is good. The restaurant is clean and the staff are friendly. It's reasonably priced and large enough for big families or coworkers having lunch. Everyone has a different taste and some may not agree, but in the 15 years we've been coming, it has always been clean with good service and great food"}
{"text":"this place dont even deserve a star! all of the food was old mushy and cold!  the mongolian bar b que was disgusting! the place wasnt good at all!  they get -100 stars!!!"}
{"text":"OK so my hubby and I were going to go to McDonald's across the parking lot when said hubby decided we should eat here. He'll eat anything. I on the other hand should've trusted the reviews, but gave it a chance regardless. I was hesitant and with reason. Just walking in it smelled like fish, really really fishy. The place was clean which was somewhat shocking. The lady who took care of us was really nice but we only stayed for like 10 mins. I took one bite and was done..now we're at McDonalds"}
{"text":"Continuing our family tradition of Chinese buffets on holidays, we ventured out to find a decent buffet on Thanksgiving. I'm not big into buffets and the previous reviews on this place had me skeptical. We decided to take a 20 minute drive down and see what New China/Lee's Buffet had to offer. We pulled up and the parking lot was crowded. Heading inside I stopped a group of ladies and asked about the food. They all agreed the food and prices were good. 

Once inside, I headed straight for teriyaki chicken. I piled on an assortment of steamed rice, lo mien, pot stickers, teriyaki chicken and dim sum. It was all actually really good. My main complaint was that the food wasn't hot. It was all warm but was not have the hot fresh meal I was hoping for. I went back for seconds and loaded up my plate with the same items. My husband had sushi, desserts, shrimp....and basically a small sample of everything offered. He agreed that the food was good but wasn't sure if he would make the 25 minute drive again to this buffet.

Our server was great. A little slow getting our refills back to us but overall nice and keeping our table cleans. The restaurant was very clean. All of the staff was great. Great selection of food, almost too many shrimp selections. I try to stay far far away from public restrooms so I didn't even attempt those. My biggest issue was that the food was hot. If I'm ever back in the area, I'll definitely stop again but we won't ever go out of our way to eat here."}
{"text":"Very Nice workers, feel like family here. You can talk to them if you need anything. Foods are very good with the price you paid. This is an old restaurant but the lady is also cleaning so it is surprisingly very clean inside. Come here one in a while for dinner"}
{"text":"Disgusting... Need to be shut down, maybe we should have clued in when they make your pay first."}
{"text":"Place is just OK. It is old, dingey, and needs an update. Not very many selections on the food, and what's there wasn't that good. Items did not seem fresh, although they kept them filled. I could not find any healthy choices, except the salad bar, but I don't waste my appetite on salads at a Chinese restaurant. I wanted something sweet at the end, so went to try the apple pie, it was not cut into slices/pieces and it had been dug into randomly - it was a mess and did not look too appetizing. The reason I gave it 2 stars is that it is only around $8-$9 dollars for dinner."}
{"text":"Good food , staff not very nice , even though we come here regularly.dining room and restrooms are well taken care of."}
{"text":"Well, shame on me for not consulting Yelp before going here. This place is run down and full of the unwashed. You could hunt for something not disgusting on the buffet, but still not sure if the choices will haunt my bowels later. Will never return."}
{"text":"Among the worst Chinese buffets in Phoenix. 

I really shouldn't have gone here, I knew it wouldn't be good but I was hungry and stopped for dinner. It was worse than I expected. And not cheap enough considering how poor the food tasted. The flavor and temperature sucked. Not much selection either. I will never go back. It was that bad."}
{"text":"Nope, sorry.  I cannot pass anything but the price here.  My bill was $9.99...if it had been 2 pennies more, I'd be mad.  

We ended up here after we found out that the Hunan VIII across the street was closed for remodeling until AUGUST:(  I had suggested Hunan VIII after getting coupons and reading decent reviews here...so I was a bit embarrassed by the place being closed (not a short drive for any of us, either). 

I could tell by the outside of the place.  Yeah yeah, whatever about judging books by their covers...all that went out the window with this place.  Maybe its because I was really excited about Hunan, but I saw wavy stink lines rising from this place when I pulled up.  Sillyishly, I followed my cousins in...  I looked around as we stood in line and then did the dumbest thing of all...I paid.

Now I'll start my review in the bathroom, because that's where I headed first to check on my lil' cuz who really had to go before we got there I guess.  Kitchen, women's bathroom, men's bathroom, and the door to outside were all in this little hall, which isn't a big deal cause you see that all the time.  But this time, it just seemed...icky, and dark, and foreboding.  And the bathroom had sticky floors.  Minus one star for any establishment.  Get some friggin Pine-sol.

So I finish checking on him and head for the food.  Was it really 70 something dishes there?  I guess, but it didn't really seem like it.  Just looking at everything, it seemed decent, just a little low-budget.  I was ok at that point because I knew I paid only 10 bucks for a buffet.  So I made my plate, and became disappointed with the offerings.  Too many similar chicken dishes.  Too many things with shells that needed peeling.  And upon a closer look at what I was heaping on my plate, it all looked...off.
Sat down and realized there was no beverage.  Self-serve; I like self-serve beverages.  Two dispenser machine things, your very basic selections but I guess you don't need that many at a buffet.  But it was so unkempt in this spot...like nothing but kids came up to get drinks with no supervision.  You know what I mean.
Finally dug in.  
Nope.
Potstickers?  So greasy it feels like I STILL need to wipe my mouth.
Chicken on a Stick?  That didn't taste like any chicken I've ever had...and if it wasn't chicken, it wasn't pork, beef, or anything else.
Pepper Chicken?  All pepper, no chicken taste...and black table pepper at that.
Saucy chicken, beef, pork dishes?  All sauces were terrible, all meats tasted like a different, unidentifiable meat.  Not exaggerating.
Rangoons?  Plenty of goon; almost ran.  I opened one up and there was this greasy and crumbly 'stuff' in there, and very little of it at that.
Wings?  They had hot and regular fried.  Bad texture ruined a halfway decent taste for the fried...and the hot seemed like it had some of the same horrid sauce from other dishes on them.
Didn't touch anything with shells.  One of the kids got crab legs...the smallest crab legs I've EVER seen.  She loves crab legs but didn't even finish the 3 she had.
Another cuz, gagged on the egg foo young.  I caught the rest picking at their plates with forks, but eventually scarfed it all down due to hunger.  One did say he enjoyed it...but he is easily pleased with food.
This was the least I've ever eaten at a buffet.  I couldn't get past how unclean it all seemed, and I'm not usually that kind of out-eater.  I kept tasting the food with the tip of my tongue before I let it all in my mouth, afraid I would taste something extra horrid.  
Can't speak of the service.  They came and got plates.  Job done.
Food was brought out at a good rate. 
The first bad buffet I've been to.  But hey, there were plenty of other customers...well not plenty, but enough.  So oh well."}
{"text":"It's about $9 to eat until you're stuffed, but it's about what you'd expect in quality for that price.  I found the service to be quite good (drink refills).  The buffet items are all over the map:  kung pao, orange chicken, buttered potatoes, crab, bbq wings, watermelon, ice cream...  I don't eat much meat at buffets like this because I find the vegetables to be better, or the rice offerings.  In other words, there's a way to make this work, although it's not a place I will return to.  It's clean and the staff were kind, if you really want quantity for your cash."}
{"text":"This place was awful. It was filthy, the booths are ripped, and crooked, the floor was disgusting, and every surface was sticky and gross. I couldn't believe I paid $30 for 2 adults & a child to eat here. The food was old & hard, and you could tell it had been sitting in the serving trays for a while. My hand was burned so bad on a stream of steam seeping out of the warming table while trying to dish food out of a tray that was too small for its slot. I honestly couldn't believe this place hasn't been shut down. We were too grossed out by the condition of the restaurant to even venture into the bathrooms. There is an infestation of flies, and just as we'd had enough and were about to leave, we saw a giant cockroach walk past our table. Basically every awful thing you could imagine about eating out exists at this place. Never again.

***Edited to add I also got extremely sick about 4 hours later!!!! I was up all night vomiting & other things as a result of obvious food poisoning after eating here. I will be calling the health department to report this business.***"}
{"text":"No, please don't go. It's awful. My friends and I went in for the lunch and everything we had was awful. The miso soup was just water. The mac and cheese was just water and cheese. The brownie was a weird coffee cake with melted sprinkles? 
Either way it was not a good experience. Even the sprite wasn't good! 
We ended up having to leave and go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place sucks don't waste your money here food is stale not clean place wondering how they stay open with the food inspector"}
{"text":"SO GROSS! Everything is so dirty, starting with the front door full of smudges. They could invest in some windex. The tables look like they dont get cleaned, they are covered with greasy food residue. The soda and water dispensers have black fingerprints all over them. 
Most of the food is cold and old. The \"sushi\" that i had one bite of was so rubbery i had to spit it out. Not to mention the avocado in the sushi rolls was brown like it had been sitting out all day. Everything is mislabeled or missing a label, i dont think i saw a single tray that had the contents which the label stated. 
It was overall GROSS! I dont understand how this place is still in bussiness."}
{"text":"Simply put, mediocre at best. For the price, there are much better Chinese buffets with much better food and selection.  Thumbs down on this one."}
{"text":"For a speedy, cheap lunch, it's tolerable. As Asian food goes, Yeesh, I sure hope not."}
{"text":"Not very good today. Food was had a lot of grease pretty bad when the rice leaves a grease spot on the plate"}
{"text":"Okay... let me start by saying that this place is a great deal for what you are spending.g (8.99 for dinner). However, put that aside and what you have is a dirty meat factory. Almost all of the dishes were shrimp, and the blandest shrimp to say the least. I have never eaten so much food that had no flavor whatsoever. If there was a prize for taking food and making it taste like nothing this place would win, hands down. I believe that this is the only Chinese restaurant that I wish used MSG. They got two stars because they were friendly and the service was decent."}
{"text":"Well,  we were craving Chinese food, and i asked \"tried and true or something new?\"
We decided on something new,
First thought was, \"geez, this place is expensive for the size and condition of the restaurant.\"
Second thought was \"well the foods not great, not good, but not bad.\"

This would have been a two star rating.

HOWEVER,

Two different chicken dishes had rotten chicken in them.  If you've ever smelled or accidentally tasted rotten chicken, you know it's not something you ever forget, or want to repeat.

Zero stars if it were possible.

Do yourself a favor.  Go to Mike Kwan's Golden Coin.  It's a shit hole, and you get no variety, but the food is FRESH and HOT."}
{"text":"Did not find anything rancid,sad when that is the best you can say.Like others have said ,cold steam tables,no lemon for the ice tea,no ice tea ,LOTS of food on the floor and staff that all seemed to be auditioning for a zombie movie."}
{"text":"Very good food...friendly and accomdating staff...prices are reasonable and id recommend this one in a heartbeat..."}
{"text":"I even checked Yelp for reviews of this place before I want to try it. The reviews seemed good for the most part but I don't know what those people were thinking. 

The selection was average at best featuring all sorts of breaded chicken dishes. They had an assortment of American food choices I'm assuming for the kid's but not one item that I put on my plate was actually hot. Most were barely warm and probably not over the 140 degree mark that is required by the health department. 

I was impressed that they offer food to go that you pay for by the pound but after dining in, I would never go back for take out."}
{"text":"Well food is mediocre, at best. Don't ever plan on going on a Sunday it's packed from wall to wall and the staff seemingly can't handle the crowd."}
{"text":"I ate here two times. Both times there was a disgusting smell in the bathroom so bad that I almost puked up my meal. I could just get my hands wet and run out of that rancid bathroom. The bathroom is by the kitchen. And the place was never busy. So, there is no excuse for not keeping the bathroom at least smelling decent. Some of the food was cold. There were a few OK dishes. I read a good review on their ice cream and could not try it because there was not any in the machine. Some deep fried dishes were under cooked. I like to shop at Smart and Final right by this place. Very disappointed in New China Buffet and I have no plans of ever returning."}
