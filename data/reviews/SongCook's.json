{"text":"This restaurant definitely serves above average food, but is by no means mind blowingly delicious. They can be extremely busy at times, so it pays to make a reservation or come during off hours. The service is nothing special for your average Asian restaurant. Personally, I would go for the noodles here, as I find their other offerings to be okay at best."}
{"text":"First time there and the pork bone soup is delicious, filling, and well worth the money. Slightly hard to find (since it's near a busy intersection) but very roomy and spacious, making it a good place for a meal."}
{"text":"First time visit with friends on Sunday. The place is really big but still busy with packed area.  I am not a fan of Korean food but I love this restaurant. It does not offer KoreanBBQ. But there are tons of traditional Korean dishes which you can never find in other places.  We order the famous stewed beef (cannot remember the name exactly as my friends come regularly and ordered all of them for us). The beef is really tender as I can imagine they should spent at least half day to cook it. The taste is coming from the inside. I love the tofu soup. It can be the best I've ever tried. Tasty and spicy. We also had the sweet chilly fried chicken. Big portion and it's good. Bibimbap is really nice to try too! Songcook also provides all kinds of rices. Should try it next time."}
{"text":"Pork bone soup hearty and delicious, black bean noodles and fried dumpling all delicious and very flavourful will be back. Service friendly and prompt as well."}
{"text":"ordered jja jang myun + kkang pung ki combo, bokeum bop, and hwe dup bop. Jja jang myun was ok - a little greasy. The kkang pung ki was this bright orange color, that I've never seen in a kkang pung ki before. it tasted like sweet and sour chicken (tang su yuk), and didn't have much spice. The bokeum bop came with a jja jang sauce. Without the sauce it was so bland and honestly not good at all. The sauce made it edible. The hwe dup bop had a good flavor - the kket nip and some other herbs really helped the dish. WIsh it had more tuna in it-- it was mostly salmon and white fish.  Overall the experience was ok, but the taste of food was subpar."}
{"text":"Best described by the latin phrase praeclarus atqui subtilis, song cooks clearly accomplish their goal in delivering on Korean fare in an open and inviting environment.  The bibimbap is a fine example of the iconic Korean dish, flavourful and composed, it very easily could become the benchmark against which other bibimbap are compared in the city."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 7 and we got one of the more private tables (not on the floor). They provide some pretty big portions so we had enough to take for home. The ajumma that served us was very responsive and nice about taking a group photo for us. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away at the back of a plaza so if you're not looking for it, you'd probably miss it entirely. It's a gem and I'm happy my friend suggested we try it. Luckily we made reservations (group of 6) otherwise we would have probably had to wait awhile as there was a crowd waiting to be seated. I called the day of and though they were able to squeeze us in they advised that they usually only take reservations a day in advance.  We were seated in the heated platform area so we kicked off our shoes and sat cross legged for the entire meal.  If you're tall you'd probably want to sit at the ends so you can sprawl out occasionally. My fiance and friends had to stand up a couple of times just to stretch out.  The heated floor/platform was great especially since it was cold out but after awhile we were all over heated - wear layers (this is a family restaurant after all).   Anyways, onto the food. The food was delicious and they have all your standard Korean food with a number of chef specials. One stand out dish we had was the fried chicken in sweet & spicy sauce (listed under the Chef's Specials for $18). Everyone loved it and by far the winner of the night. It wasn't very spicy so I wouldn't worry about it if you usually avoid spicy food.  The service was great and they took time to explain dishes that we were curious about.   Dishes were around $10 and the chef specials are a bit pricier at about $18 - $25. Here is a link to their menu that I found online: http://forums.redflagdeals.com/song-cook-korean-restaurant-mini-review-yonge-steeles-970606/  I went back in December and they didn't have their liquor license yet but the manager confirmed that it was in the works. He explained that the license was put on hold so he could deal with other things like ensuring the building was up to spec with fire department. Fire hazards vs soju drunkeness , hmm..I.'m glad he had his priorities straight.   I'd go back any day."}
{"text":"Pros:  1) Come here for the Jampong and kampungi (sweet and spicy fried chicken) 2) Good service esp for families 3) fresh homemade kimchi  Cons: 1) limited side dishes 2) other main dishes are decent but not great  Song Cook serves decent Korean fare and provides great service. However, their jampong (spicy seafood noodle soup) stands out and may possibly be the best in the GTA. I've tried Jampong at every Korean restaurant that serves it and what sets Song Cook apart is the broth and noodles.  You won't find Jampong in most Korean restaurants because it is a dish popularized by Chinese living in Korea.  After talking with the manager it was clear to me why Song Cooks jampong stands out. Their broth is cooked daily and their noodles made fresh in house. While the dish could be topped with fresher seafood it diminishes the taste. So don't order the dish expecting fresh tasting seafood, it's overlooked for a reason. The magic is in the soup and if you appreciate how ramen soup taste, this is the seafood version but with a larger kick of Korean spices. For good jampong the depth of flavor in the soup is key and time after time Song cook consistently serves the best jampong i have tried so far.   Other dishes that were quite good were their Kalbi Jim and Kampungi chicken (ask for more spicy and it will be perfect)"}
{"text":"VENUE:  I came here on a chilly winter day with the family to celebrate my sister's birthday. After we parked I wanted just to run inside to the warmth. From the outside, nothing seemed unusual. It seemed like the typical small, quaint, and cozy Korean joint with limited seating. To my surprise, it was quite the opposite. This may very well be the largest Korean restaurant I've been too!  I was simply amazed at the size of the place. There are plenty of private rooms, different dining spaces, and even an area with raised floor seating. And get this, the floors are heated! Definitely a plus for those cold winter nights. Not only that, they also had a really elaborate decor. My eyes were kept entertained by the display of Korean artifacts, bamboo plants, and other suitably placed objects. My favourite was the row of rice cookers on display, each with a different kind of rice inside.    THE GOOD  F14 - Five Spices Jokbahl ($21)- tender seasoned pork hock, served with sliced garlic and peppers Song Cook's seems to always have promotional and seasonal menus, serving up items that are not on the regular menu. A \"Fall Special\" menu was offered to us at our visit, consisting of dishes to combat the cooler weather. We decided to go with the Five Spices Jokbahl from this menu. It's served with large leaf lettuce, garlic cloves, and special sauce. We got the impression that it was meant to be assembled consumed as lettuce wraps, but the meat tastes just as good on its own. The portions are generous and definitely was more than enough meat to share. We actually had to order an extra side of lettuce leaves ($4) to finish up the dish!   F7-Jim Kalbi ($24) - marinated steamed beef ribs The Jim Kalbi braised ribs were delicious! they were probably stewing for a while because the meat was so tender and infused with flavour. Its quite home style and Reminds me of the rib stews that my dad makes. Of course I'm obligated to say that my dad makes it better, but this comes close to second best.   B3-Gan Ja Jang ($10)- fresly made black bean sauce and pork on noodles If there is one thing you have to try at song cook, it'll have to be the Gan Ja Jang. The noodles are the perfect chewy texture, and the bean paste is infused with flavours without being overly salty.   THE...NOT SO GOOD  F1- Pork Tang Su Yuk ($18) -Korean style sweet and sour pork I never thought I'd have bad things to say about fried chicken. but I wasn't too fond of this Pork Tang Su Yuk. It got soggy very quickly, and the flavour of the sweet & sour sauce didn't do much to compensate. I've definitely had better elsewhere.  F10-Hae Mul Pa Jan($18) - Seafood and green onion pancake with vegetables The Hae Mul Pan Jan was also a bit underwhelming. It was palatable, but not very balanced between flour and other ingredients. Not enough seafood, too much fluff. It's a gigantic pancake that will serve as a filler for sure, but one I would've been happy to pass this one up.   THOUGHTS: There were some hits and misses, but I think I would definitely come back for the Gan Ja Jang and Jim Kalbi. A meal leaving 8 people fully and satisfied, for only $118 is also quite an incentive to come back!"}
{"text":"Pleasant surprize. One of the best korean restaurants in toronto and they opened not too long ago. I love their heated floor seats but make sure not to order dishes served on hot stone/plates if you choose the heated floor seating area.  : )  I liked the variety in their menu and nice service. Side dishes are always refillable and waitresses/waiters were very attentive during my visit.  I would definitely bring guests there for special occasions.  The size of the restautant is large and plenty of parking avail."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean Restaurant I have ever been to!  I'm not Korean and before Song Cook's, I didn't even think I liked Korean food that much. Their Kalbijim (stewed beef) dish is simply amazing. I always get the large size so I can take it to go and make noodles with it the next week. It's really fall off the bone good. The Jjajangmyun (black bean sauce noodle) is about as good as it gets. It's not too strong in flavor and very tasty.  I wish they had a downtown location nearby so I could go weekly!  (I actually had to sign up for yelp just to post how amazing this place is)"}
{"text":"If there's one Korean place I would love to live at, it would be Song Cook's. Although during busy hours, there's kind of a wait, but that's to be expected at all restaurants.   Starting off with the customer service, great! Upon entering, there is an employee to warmly greet you, thus taking you to your seats. During rush hour, when we didn't gain much attention from the servers, the manager stepped in and saw that we be given the proper things to enjoy our meal. 5 stars for that manager alone!   Now to the main part, the food. I've tried many dishes but my personal favourites are the pork bone soup, as always, the jajangmyun and fried rice 2 dish combo, their fried dumplings and the seafood tofu soup! After many other Korean restaurants, Song Cook's has had consistently delicious food after each of my visits, the noodles are always firm and fresh, the pork bone soup is fall off the bone and actually spicy, and their dumplings come out crisp and hot. If I had one complaint it would be the mountains of cabbage on the rice, but even that is a small price to pay for the delicious foods that Song Cook's gives!   Song Cook's incorporates not only incredible, mouth watering food, but also great customer service along with an atmosphere that screams homey and traditional, along with the cross-legged seating that the place offers. Song Cook's is 5/5 for a reason."}
{"text":"Suggested family to go here from yelp reviews. Went with small group of 8, arrived at the restaurant looked pretty nice inside and busy.  food took forever to arrive pork bone soup and kalbi beef rib not that great  kimchi literally came on a plate these big strips of cabbage they actually gave us scissors to cut up, same with the kalbi used scissors to cut up the large strips of meat, meat was dry and bland will not be going back"}
{"text":"They say they close at 12 am but we went in at 10:58 pm and they said they are not taking anymore customers. So disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"For Bibimbap there are a few places that compare to this. My wife and I love Korean food and this is the reason why! The place is big, clean and the staff are helpful. The food is by far some of the best Korean in town. The only reason I gave this a 4 star is because of the waits before being seated. Still, it's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Came here due to the great review, and I was not disappointed.  Ordered the black bean sauce noodles and pork bone soup and it was the best one I had! You do need to pay extra for rice but there are many choices including brown and barley option.    Service was excellent and very friendly, although we weren't greeted at the door right away and had to wait a fair bit with other patrons.  Food was great so well worth it.   Will be back for more to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Came here last Thursday and was very very satisfied. In addition to the usual ban chan dishes, there were two other ones: acorn jelly and jap chae.   The meal was so delicious, and at the end we got these little sweet dough balls which was a nice surprise! I guess I haven't been here for a while and things changed. Service was great as usual.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Went there tonite with my parents. Mum and I both got large size (whole) samgyetang which was delicious, but honestly the broth was extremely bland though the chicken itself was very tender and  the bowl stayed hot for our entire meal. I also ordered the dolsot bibimbap which was pretty standard, though instead of white rice I opted for the \"healthy\" brown, barley and bean rice... It was delicious and a nice alternative to the white. And LOL super ghetto with like legit six rice cookers cutely arranged side by side near the kitchen, waitstaff scoop n serve for ya!! ;-) My dad got one of the specials on the paper placemat, the ohjinguh bokkeum, for $6 and honestly it was a HUGE and tasty super affordable dish!!! The sauce was unreal!! He also got the jajamgmyeon with \"invisible beef\" and \"hair sized shreds of squid\" which he didn't like too much-- i think that was the only lowlight of the meal though. sauce was good, dish overall mediocre and the seafood and beef... well yea, from my dads review... meeehh. BUT!! The meal was served with a large sized traditional yet über-tasty spicy baechu kimchi and kkaduki, pickled radish, side of doenjang and raw onions (to be quick-pickled with the vinegar on the side), hot roasted barley tea for each person, yumm. All the waitstaff speak fluent English and were very helpful to my parents in explaining particular ingredients and dishes in detail... They were very attentive and really friendly. We went at 8, waited 10 mins for a table (we opted for chair and table style seating, though the traditional seating on the other side of the restaurant looked really awesome, what with their heated wooden floors.. Looks super cosy.) and were seated and given ample time to look at the menu and ask questions... Overall the experience was incredibly positive and I will surely return to try their kimchi-tuna-soon tofu stew instead of the samgyetang next time. Met one of the managers too after the meal and he was super nice and very friendly too. I looved SongCooks!"}
{"text":"Read good reviews on yelp and decided to check this place out. Went in at around 9pm on Thursday and their ddukbokki (spicy rice cakes) were sold out =(. Waiter said they are usually sold out around 8pm so if you want this dish, come early! I ordered their pork bone soup and it was Delicious! Unlike many other places, you don't have to work hard at all to get their big chunks of meat off the bones. My bf had their spicy beef and tofu kimchi soup and it was really good too."}
{"text":"I came here once with a friend for dinner, and I ordered the Kimchi Chigae. The Kimchi Chigae was pretty decent, nothing special. I don't know if it was only the time I went, but the only banchan given to us was Kimchi. Although the kimchi was good, I wish there were more varieties of banchan.   Extra points given to the interior design, as I was sitting on the tables where you take off your shoes. I'm a sucker for those things haha, but service was hard to find even though the place was pretty empty at that time."}
{"text":"One of the best Korean Restaurants that I've been going back to for years. They have authentic food, cooks and servers. A cute area where you can try this traditional custom of sitting on the floor to eat which is elevated from the actual ground. If your preference is to sit in a chair they have a huge area for regular dining as well. Would definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Just gotta mention first that the service here is amazing. I don't know what it is but every time I go to a Korean place, they always have the nicest staff. Service was quick and the waiter I had a super nice. The food here was really good too. I got this noodle thing it tasted superb and the portion was really huge. Portions here are pretty great. Also considering how you can get loaded on your typical Korean side dishes. The place was clean and organized and the washrooms were pretty well kept. There is a lot of seating and I'm not sure what it was but there were tables where you kneel at. It was cool seeing it for the first time. I've also heard great things about this place from friends. This place was actually the first time I had a taste of Korean food (besides kbbq). This is a great place to try Korean food for the first time (:"}
{"text":"What a great place!   I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this restaurant. From the minute we stepped in to when we left, everything was amazing.   First, I love the decor and the entire feel of the place. It's big and open, and kind of like a chalet with all the wooden panelling. But it's still got an Asian feel, without the cramped space - a definite plus :)   Our waitress was so polite and sweet the entire time. Started with roasted wheat tea and usual kimchi appetizers. Although the banchan was fewer than other places (only got kimchi cabbage and radish), this was made up for by the large portions of our other food.   Both my dining partner and I ordered combos from a really visually-appealing, big menu. Surprised to see that the prices were still very much like other, smaller Korean places.   I ordered:  1) Combo with: half jajangmyeon (black bean noodles) and half champong (spicy seafood soup) with rice $8.50 - Both were very good portion sizes, and for my small stomach, I probably would've been full with just one of each order! But the black bean noodles were delicious: cooked perfectly al dente, flavour was deep and complex. The spicy seafood soup, although with not much seafood, was also really good with a lot of different flavours, and perfect level of spice.   Friend ordered:  2) Combo with: half jajangmyeon and deep-fried sweet and sour chicken $12.00  - I tried a piece of his sweet and sour chicken, and it was a lot tastier than standard versions. The white meat was really tender and juicy, and batter wasn't too thick. So good.   Service was great, and so accommodating. I had a great time here, and can't wait to try the other things on their menu! I hear their cold noodles are also good :)"}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoyed coming her to partake and enjoy what of their set course menu. We typically order at least the 6 person course - the food is also plentiful and seating is spacious"}
{"text":"A bit difficult to find and somewhat uninviting from the outside, this is a nice Korea restaurant in the north of the city.  I have been here on a few occasions and I would recommend it for anyone looking to eat some Korean food. They have a regular table section as well as a floor section and I personally prefer the floor since the tables are usually crowded and have a wait time.  The food is fairly priced, tasty, fresh and they have a reasonable variety however it has a bit of a \"nothing special\" feel to it. Food portions are big and they also have a good selection of drinks with fairly priced alcohol as well.  I have seen people say that the staff is rude, or behaves unusually which I believe might be more due to cultural differences or a language barrier. I can certainly see how the staff might come off as abrasive, but I've never felt that way personally and they always go out of their way to make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"This place can get busy, so try to come at the right time!  We came and sat at the sit down tables, and it is a bit different if you aren't used to it.  You need to take off your shoes and you are on an elevated platform where you sit on the floor with the table slightly higher than you.  Service was good.  The server was attentive, although it was a bit hard to get their attention when the customers started lining up at the door.  It isn't bad, it is just that you need to flag them down instead of them coming by and offering assistance/service as needed.  The food here was delicious.  We got the pork bone soup, big serving of sweet and sour pork, bean noodles and the dumplings, all of which were very good.  The price is your normal Korean pricing, roughly $10 a dish.  Note that rice here is extra since they have many different types of rice and don't want you to just stick with regular white rice.  Remember to check-in, you get a free pop with your meal!  I've been here several times and would have no issues returning."}
{"text":"Pros: -soup in Pork Bone Soup was the best I've ever had...very hearty -good service  Cons: -you have to pay extra for rice -very few side dishes provided -a little pricey"}
{"text":"Food: Everything we ordered tasted delicious. We decided to order a set combo for 4 ppl for $87.99. It came with just enough food. The menu is quite extensive. It was my first time having Korean Sashimi salad, very fresh and tasty (good portion). Kalbi Beef were perfectly marinated thick slices (6 pieces). The Korean sweet and sour pork is crispy on the outside and tender inside with a nice light sauce (huge portion). Tofu Kimchi soup is spicy and flavourful but the portion was very small for 4 ppl. *we were disappointed to only receive 4 small side dishes  Service: you should definitely make reservations on a weekend. Our servers were friendly but very busy and it took a while to get their attention. They are thoughtful in providing proper serving utensils and refilling tea. We were impressed seeing the servers carefully wipe down and reset all the tables before seating the next group of guests.    Price: *I find certain dishes are much more expensive than other Korean restaurants like the Seafood Pancake is $20, Japchae is $20, bowl of rice is $3.50. With tax and tip you can expect to pay about $30 per person for a very satisfying dinner.   Family-friendly: there's plenty of seating for large groups and the traditional floor seating is great for families with kids."}
{"text":"I really like this place, food is delicious and plentiful for the price. I've come here three times now and I enjoyed the first two visits very much.   The first time, I came with my bf and our friend and there was a long line up. They told us that there's no seats in the dining room, but there are heated floor seats. We  were really tired from a long day so we opted to sit on the floor. It was a nice experience, since it was really cold that day, the heated floor helped. We ordered the jajang myun combo with the spicy seafood soup. For $10.99, it was really good value and so delicious. The jajang myun came with plenty of sauce, which is the best part. The spicy seafood soup came with rice and lots of tiny bits of seafood. We were all so full we each had to take some parts of our meals to go. The second time we came here we had similar experience and ordered the same thing.  The third time, I decided to order something different. I've only had soon tofu once before at a different restaurant and I had remembered it to be delicious. So I ordered the kimchi+tuna soon tofu. I was really disappointed with this dish. I had expected it to be savory and spicy, but the soup was a tomato base and the flavours came out sour and spicy and I don't really prefer sour soup. Despite this disappointing dish, we ordered the pork belly and the rice cake, which were excellent and better than I expected. Still, I kinda wish my soon tofu didn't taste sour.  All in all, I will return here for more $10.99 jajang myun specials and avoid the soon tofu, lest they change the recipe."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on Saturday. Wanted to try the traditional seating area but the wait time was too long. It wasn't too busy. The host was pleasant and professional. We were seated in less than 5 minutes. Food was good. We ordered fall off the bone soup. Very tender meat. We also ordered Kalbi. It tasted good. But the price for 3 pieces of Kalbi was a turn off ($19.99). I don't eat Kalbi that often , but I do remember it not being that expensive. Our server was polite and came to ask us how our meal was. At the end of our meal, we noticed it was getting busy and one of the workers (not the person taking our order, but the person that asked us what we wanted to drink) came to our table with the bill and debit machine and asked if we were done eating. I mean, don't you ask that before you bring out the bill? That was awkward (my husband was in the washroom and he was paying for the meal). She just stood around waiting. Overall food was 4.5 stars. (We only tried 2 items). Service was 4 stars only because of that awkward situation.  May come back to try other items and the traditional seating."}
{"text":"God where do I start?? Such a cute restaurant. I absolutely loved every single part of my experience here. Everything from the service--which was absolutely lovely--to the SPECTACULAR food. Can't even express how great the food was here, I would come back here in a heartbeat. The best part was the service though, I've never seen such amazing service before!! In fact thanks to our wonderful waiter (and yelp!!) we recieved 2 free drinks! They were very organized as well, and the food came pretty quick. Another seriously awesome part of my experience were the heated floors!!! Honestly. I feel at home."}
{"text":"I always go to song cook for Korean food.  Last week we went there as a family and ordered Korean cold noodles.  Its cold noodles doesn't come with the hot sauce , and it's tasteless,so we asked for some hot sauce. We cant believe that we need to pay extra $2 dollars for the hot sauce...Since when this restaurant starts charging extra for hot sauce? It doesn't make sense at all. Guess I'll switch to a new Korean restaurant next time."}
{"text":"Kimchi was sour.  When we asked for different Kimchi, we got another plate of sour. Lots of MSG in the Seafood noodle Jampong. Black Bean noodles were watered down and deathly sweet. Spicy Tofu stew was tasteless. Bibimbap was bland. No side dishes to speak of, except for the sour Kimchi. They charge $3.50 for the rice to go with the Spicy Tofu stew. Service was less than friendly. Clueless waitresses. Complaints went unheard.  Or uncared.  Needless to say, we will not be patronizing this establishment.  This place just doesn't measure up.  Too big to fail?  Doubt it.  Another lackadaisical attempt at a do-it-all Korean food.  Specialize.  Do it better."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic, authentic Korean food with very reasonable prices.   I'm from Florida and was visiting my friend in Toronto, and this is the best restaurant I've been to outside of Korea. The entire restaurant was filled with Korean patrons when we went. My friend and I both lived in Korea previously and we both agree it is the best Korean we've had since our time there.  Both the dol sot bibimbap and the sundubu jiggae were delicious. Kimchi was pretty good too. ;)"}
{"text":"I've been here a about 4-5 times over the past couple years.  Its consistently quite good.  Note that its a bit hidden from Steeles Road, you cannot see the storefront sign.  Free: a large portion of kimchi for the table. What I usually order: BiBimBap or any of the Jajang Combos.  If you are only a party of two, i would recommend the combos, so you get to taste two menu items.  Portions are large and good value. Also, there are 2 different seating sections: (i) typical table and chairs or (ii) on the elevated heated floor with a short table."}
{"text":"Good food, lots of options, love the heated floor seatings!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good Korean food in the Yonge and Steeles area, I would highly recommend Song Cook's.  Although there is an abundance of Korean restaurants within the vicinity, Song Cook's stands out for the quality of the food which is served in a nice atmosphere with good service.  The restaurant is tucked in behind a Moore's clothing shop (on Steeles) and the Galleria Korean supermarket (on Yonge).  Once you have located the restaurant and entered inside, you will find a spacious restaurant that is comfortable and inviting.  One portion of the restaurant is dedicated to sitting cross-legged on the floor which is nice if you are looking for a traditional Korean eating experience.  However, I am now too old to sit comfortably on the floor for any length of time, so I usually request to sit in the other part of the restaurant which has conventional tables and chairs (I also find I can eat more food when I am sitting in a chair rather than on the floor - wink, wink).  As mentioned, the restaurant is rather spacious and can easily accommodate large groups if required.  There are also portions of the restaurant that are somewhat partitioned off if your group would prefer to be slightly separated from the main room of the restaurant.  Interestingly, there are a couple of TV screens (one of them is a rather giant screen which isn't always on) that will usually be playing some sports game.  I happen to like this however, my wife feels that it distracts me from our dinner conversation (and she would be right depending on exactly what is being displayed).  The decor is pleasant and overall the atmosphere is quite comfortable.  The service is quite good.  The servers are attentive and knowledgable.  They are also quite friendly.  They can be quite busy at times given that the restaurant itself can be very busy, which means you might need to flag someone down if you need something.  However, once you get someone's attention, whatever you request is usually carried out promptly.  The food at Song Cook's is quite good.  As an individual who grew up eating Korean food almost daily, I can say that the food here is quite authentic and delicious.  We typically start with the NuroongJiTang which is a vegetable soup (there is also a seafood version) which comes with rice crisps that crackle and pop when added to the soup at your table.  This soup is exactly what is required to start a meal on a cold day during the winter.  The soup has great flavour and consistency.  Interestingly, both my wife and I noticed that the soup gets thinner as it cools, but neither of us could figure out why.  The soup comes with a variety of vegetables (mushroom, green pepper, water chestnut, broccoli, baby corn) and the aforementioned rice crisps - delicious!  Following the soup, my wife will get some version of the ChamPong (there are a variety of types) which is a seafood noodle soup dish.  A word of warning, this dish tends to be quite spicy so if you are averse to spicy foods, this dish may best be avoided.  The portion is quite generous so don't be surprised if you end up taking a portion of this dish home with you.  The noodles are thick and chewy and overall, this dish makes for some good comfort food.  I have tried the BiBimBap which also comes with a good portion size consisting of a variety of vegetables, egg, and ground beef.  You can get it in a very hot stone bowl which partially cooks the ingredients as the dish comes to your table and you start to mix and stir it up.  The YookGaeJang (spicy beef soup) is also very good.  It also comes in a very hot bowl such that the soup is literally boiling as it comes to your table.  The soup is not too spicy so I believe most people would be able to enjoy it.  There is a decent amount of beef along with onions and some other vegetables.  I have also had the JaJang which is a noodle dish with black bean sauce.  This dish is originally a Chinese dish that prior generations of Chinese chefs, living in Korea, have adapted to the Korean palate.  The JaJang is the only dish I have had at Song Cook's that was only average for me and nothing all that special.  Prices at Song Cook's are very reasonable for the quality of the food and service.  All in all, the food at Song Cook's is terrific!  It is authentic!  It is delicious!  There is a wide variety of dishes!  The service is good and the establishment itself is quite comfortable.  Highly recommended!  4.5 stars out of 5  One tip - you can download a Song Cook's app to your smart phone that allows you to collect stars each time you eat at the restaurant.  Once you collect enough stars, you can redeem them for an appetizer etc."}
{"text":"On recommendation of a colleague, went there on a weekday with my family. The place was packed. Ambient and service were great.  They seated us on a traditional Korean table setting with floor cushions which was quite unique. Our server was very pleasant and attentive.  Food tasted quite homemade and came in generous portions. Seafood pancake and ribs were quite pricey though. I would go back but only for their staple items like Bibimap and pork bone soup."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since it opened. It's the best Korean food I find in the area. Good service, especially from the owner, i think his name is Daio. He speaks perfect english and offers me free appetizer whenever he sees me. Must try their fired chicken cutlet, it's so tender, juicy and crispy. The portions are huge and price is cheap."}
{"text":"Would recommend this place! Great authentic Korean restaurant!  Went here on a weekday just right after lunch rush and there was no wait. The interior and specious dining area is very warm and inviting. Sat on the traditional floor seating and the we're heated! Service is very fast and friendly.  Food was amazing and for 4 ppl we spent less than 100 (including taxes and tip). Our server promptly brought us a great variety of sides: kimchi, pickled radish, 2 types of tofu, noodles, spicy beans sprout and vegetables. They even refilled our sides! Between four people we shared a pork bone soup, bibimbap, pork cutlet, beef galbi, fried chicken wings and purple rice. The portions are very generous and we were all easily filled! Food quality is top notch. They were all very fresh, flavourful and no msg!"}
{"text":"Pleasant servers and servers galore. I think I saw more servers than patrons when I ate had my late lunch at around 2pm.   I ordered the dolsot bibimbap - a staple Korean mixed rice dish served up in stone bowl. It's G1 on their menu.   The banchan consisted of a radish and cabbage kimchi. And you're given pieces  so large they provide scissors to cut them. To let you know, I'm not a fan of kimchi - I sampled it though.  ZZzzzzzzz the bibimbop arrived sizzling in hot stone bowl. I was pretty excited to try. The ingredients looked so beautifully arranged and colourful :)   Unfortunately though from my first spoonful it was pretty bland tasting. I added some squirts of hot sauce to give it some life, but alas the main ingredient, the rice, was soggy and overcooked. That ruined the entire meal for me. Also strangely the bowl was hot but the contents in the bowl weren't that hot?  I had a struggled eating this, alternating between taking small spoonfuls and answering emails.   To improve the taste I'd like them to use a bit more sesame oil for flavour and fix their soggy rice.   As for service, the wait staff here was very polite and were prompt with any request. Too bad the bibimbap wasn't as I good as I had hoped."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner. Have been here a couple of times and it has always been consistent. service is great and the food came really really fast! manager is also very nice."}
{"text":"Decided to come here with a large group of friends because of the stellar rating, but was left disappointed.   Quality of food - average. Nothing stood out. The tofu soup was ok. The banchan could have more variety. The bulgolgi was disappointing as there was very little meat. Most of the dish was a pile of cabbage.  Price - expensive considering most dishes don't come with rice included! The prices appeared average to me, until the server asked me if I wanted to pay and add rice; this is a first. When you consider the cost for a bowl of rice, then the meal is several dollars more than most Korean spots.   Service - very nice and welcoming. Always had a smile.   I will not be returning as my overall impression was just \"meh\" and the price was unreasonable for the food."}
{"text":"Good venue for homey Korean food.  Food is good and reasonably priced.  Can't go wrong with their pork bone soup.  Loved it. Walked and had to wait a bit for a regular seat or be seated right away at more traditional sitting area with no chairs. Clearly there are more people who prefer table and chairs even native Korean people I noticed preferred regular table.  They should make regular seating more available."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Very consistent but nothing wow. Typical Korean restaurant with nice interior. You can choose from table seating or the traditional seating."}
{"text":"best jjajangmyun i've ever had. best fried dumplings i've ever had. get the kalbijim. tastyyyyyyyy. try the barley rice. great service. great place. five stars."}
{"text":"My favourite place for authentic Korean food.  Before I start raving about the food, I have to tell you how amazing the service is! The servers are SO kind and helpful. They are quick and happy to do whatever it takes for you to feel comfortable. I have never had such consist service. They are all so genuine, and don't look at you like you're stupid when you mispronounce the dishes, haha. I am not Korean, but I have had my share of Korean food, and this place takes the cake!  The pieces are amazing! $22 will get you and your friend a delicious filling meal to share."}
{"text":"Love the option of traditional floor seating (heated in winter too!). I always come back here for their jajangmyeon. They offer some great combo options where you can get jajangmyeon half sized and another half sized entree - so you can try 2 dishes at once!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and great bibimbap. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for somewhere to eat around the area this place is the best."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and food is always pretty good. We had the braised beef - the portion was tiny for $22 and the JaJangMyun combo (we got the seafood fried rice) also only came in two small bowls. However, the pork bone soup, soondubu/tofu soups and steamed dumplings are really delicious! All in all, pretty good restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here a few days ago with my wife. Ordered the pork bone soup as it seems to be a hot commodity and I was not dissapointed. We also ordered the sweet and spicy chicken and seafood pancake. Both were equally delicious. We didn't realize the portions on these two items were fit for 4 people. Kind of wish the server informed us before we ordered it but it's no biggie. We had lots to take home! Food was delicious and service was awesome as well. Our server checked in with us a few times and was very friendly and polite."}
{"text":"We tried Bibimbap and Sashimi salad, the bibimbap was good but tge sashimi was nothing too special. The side dishes were pretty good though."}
{"text":"Been here a few times; they serve \"Chinese-style\" Korean food.  I like coming here for their jajangmyeon combos - you get a smaller order of jajangmyeon accompanied with a smaller order of a main dish.  The portions are pretty big and you'll no doubt be stuffed if you eat both the jajangmyeon and the main dish.  Their jajangmyeon is pretty good - not too salty and the noodles aren't too gummy or sticky."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Korean in town.  Discovered by accident, we got take out first time.  Went for dinner twice since then. It's hidden, but it's definitely a gem. Great staff, inexpensive and amazing food. Feels like I'm back in Seoul every time I go there.  Will keep coming back. And brought my friends there twice already. They were extremely happy."}
{"text":"I have to write them an updated review. The service has been impeccable during my most recent visits! The waiter was SO attentive, that it was borderline creepy (just kidding)!  I've given their menu another chance, and I'm in love with their JaJeng Myun. The noodles are perfectly chewy and the portions are enormous enough that I can pack up half for lunch the next day.   I love that all the waiters speak perfect English, and the manager is super friendly! This will be my new go-to Korean restaurant from now on!   The only complaint I have is their seating area where you have to take off your shoes. Many of my friends have complained about backaches because you're seating cross-legged on hard floor with no back support, and your feet will fall asleep guaranteed. So hopefully, they change that area to normal tables and chairs like the rest of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"There isn't a very good selection of Korean restros in the city, but from that not-so-great list, this is the best one that I've been to. It's not bad and it is the only place that I will eat Korean food at. They do the old style cha chang myeum  and muel nangmyum very well. I however usually just get dol sot bibimbap - full of great veggies in a stone bowl pot."}
{"text":"I love Korean food, and Songcooks is one of my absolute favorites, I've been here several times and it is the bomb.   I've ordered (i will not try and butcher the korean way of saying things lol soooo) the spicy rice cakes, the noodles with black sauce, and tons of other things.   The quality and quantity of food is just amazing I would come here 10x over a nakwon, they have quick service, and it's priced really well.   Have to come back and try again"}
{"text":"Amazing Kalbijim.  Melts in your mouth.  The accompanying radish was a bit too salty though.  And the side dishes were limited compared to other Korean restaurants in North York.  Ja Jian noodles were also great!"}
{"text":"I visited with my friend. It's been a while and they changed their menu. We ordered the Grilled kimchi rice (technically dupbap) and black bean noodles, which were one of their recommended dishes. The kimchi rice had a lot of flavour and tasted great, while the black bean noodles were just okay. The friendly service and cleanliness bumped up half a star for a 4-star rating. I would like to come back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Always packed Korean restaurant at Yonge and Steeles. Serves quality food ranging from rice cakes, grilled meats, various korean stews and platters.  Points of Interest: They have tradition korean tabletop floor seating for those wanting to try the authentic experience. You have to take off your shoes and the tables are typically low, might be a bit uncomfortable if you're tall.  Song Cooks serves different types of rice, such and brown, brown &barley, beans and stone pot rice. Way to increase your fibre!  The seafood pancake ($27.99) is very big and can easily serve 4-6 ppl. The batter is fried up crisp yet retains moisture of the seafood and still fluffy on the inside. Grilled pork belly comes with 3 strips on a bed of onions. Good amount of meat for the price compared to LA Kalbi or other beef dishes.  Review: The dishes are on the pricey end, considering that most mains don't include rice and the bbq meats don't come with veggie wraps. The veggie plate ($5.99) only comes with 5 pieces of green lettuce, 1 piece of kale and 3 pieces of shiso leaves. Kimchi is served as side dishes, but I've been to other korean restaurants with a much more impressive spread.  Tips: Call to book ahead of time. There's another location west of town, so make sure you check the address before booking."}
{"text":"Location is kind of far from my home, but someone told me good things about this place so I went.  Friendly staff and cool interior. Visited here many times. There are usually around 3 to 4 side dishes so it's not a whole lot of variety. A bit above my price range but the interior is nice and clean and all the food were satisfactory."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Song Cook's for a couple of years now. The quality and taste of the food is consistent and delicious and has me coming back for more every time. My last visit I ordered the Kalbi, Bibimbap, and Jajang Myun. All three dishes were full of flavour. The Jajang Myun (Noodles with Black Bean Sauce) at Song Cooks Korean is a must try! Although this dish was originated from China, it is one of the most popular dishes in Korea. It is also one of my favourite Korean comfort foods. Traditionally made, the ground pork with minced vegetables, and black bean sauce adds a big punch of flavour to this simple, yet delicious noodle dish! It's perfect for a chilly winter day! The Kalbi is a staple that I order every time I there and it never disappoints. The Bibimbap was delicious as well. Unfortunately, I was so hungry and inhaled it before I realized I forgot to take a photo of it! Haha...Service was great and efficient as always. They have a very extensive selection of dishes and you'll be sure to find something you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"Best JaJangMyun in GTA area. Also tried their ChamPong (delicious) KamJaTang (fresh) and KalBiJjim (very tasty). Highly recommend to try this Korean restaurant if you love korean food or just want a good meal. Overall, great tasty korean food at affordable pricing."}
{"text":"really expensive !! We, two people spent over $92 for pork bone soup seafood pancake and pork BBQ. And we paid another $15 for tips. Over 100 dollars for lunch!!!This is the first time I saw the pork bone soup doesn't come with rice!!! The inside of the pork is cold! The soup is $8.99 that's fine. But one bowl of rice is $3.5 which is a lot. seafood pancake is 27!!"}
{"text":"Taste: If a restaurant has HweDupBap available, I always order it! It's one of my favourite Korean dishes. The vegetables and fish were very fresh and tasted great when it was all mixed together with the savoury and spicy Gochujang. It had salmon and tilapia, but you can sub for just one or the other. It also came with a small bowl of soup, and rice. Complimentary side dishes including kim chi was also served.  Service: Great. Our orders came out in a timely manner, and all the servers were very nice.  Value: Good value. The HweDupBap was $13.99 and I feel like i got what I paid for... especially with the complimentary assorted side dishes.  Ambiance: The place is kind of hard to find as it is hidden behind a plaza. The restaurant has a very homey feel. Half of the space has traditional heated floor seating which is something different. The other half has standard table seating. I chose to sit on the floor and loved that traditional experience."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had an okay experience at SongCook's. The restaurant was clean and the service was pleasant. They have a pretty huge menu with all your favorite Korean dishes.   We were a bit too excited and over-ordered. We got the sweet and sour chicken (KhanPoungGi), spicy seafood & vegetable noodle soup (ChamPong) and black bean sauce noodles (JaJangMyun).   Portions are huge. I really enjoyed the JaJangMyun, it was well-balanced and flavorful without being too salty. My girlfriend enjoyed her ChamPong as well.  I have mixed feelings about the sweet and sour chicken. I was expecting it to be more spicy, but it was pretty one-note sweet & sour. It's definitely a dish to share with more than 2 people, as we struggled to put a dent into it. It subsequently killed my appetite (& taste buds), so I would be hesitant to order again.  Overall a good Korean restaurant with a large menu and comfortable atmosphere. Portions are large and pricing is fair. Everything was good, but I was not overly excited about any one dish. Also, the sweet & sour chicken just threw me off and I was hoping for a larger variety of banchan (small appetizer dishes).   *3.5 stars*"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. Poor quality, over-priced food and terrible service. We were served with the wrong dish, and they refused to correct the mistake. The waiter had a terrible attitude and made an embarrassing confrontation. Not pleasant at all. Sadly, we will not return again."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends for a birthday celebration. This restaurant was reasonably priced and the food was good. We sat at the traditional tatami tables which was a neat experience-- just make sure not to wear anything too short or tight which might make it hard to kneel. In terms of Korean side appetizers-- the variety was more limited compared to other restaurants; it only came with kimchi, bean sprouts, some type of other spicy pickles, and sweet yellow radishes.   I ordered the black bean noodles ($8.99), which in my opinion was okay for the first few bites... but I soon got tired of eating a whole bowl of the same flavour. My favourite dishes were the perfectly-grilled LA Kalbi (split between 3 was $7 each for one rib), the refreshing cold soup noodles naengmyeon, and the spicy and chewy ddeokbokki (rice cakes) with ramen. Bibimbap and the seafood soup noodles were also not bad choices.   Overall, this would be a good place for occasions such as birthdays, etc., with the good service, spaciousness, and ambience (The servers even sang happy birthday while bringing the cake). However, I wouldn't come here often as there are other cheaper Korean restaurants with equally-good food."}
{"text":"Cute Korean restaurant that has decent service in my opinion. The lady was very attentive when we first got in, but as the night went on, we started seeing less and less of her. The food was great though. We ordered the cold noodles, fried chicken starter , pork bone soup, and ribs. Place is quite spacious, and you don't feel hurried or squished at all. Very family friendly, I'd say. All in all would come back again."}
{"text":"I was really and pleasantly surprised how much I liked this place.  Yup, it's not easy to find and not sure how my friend even knew of this place, but your landmark is the Galleria Supermarket (Yonge and Steeles locale). If you enter the parking lot as if you were going to Galleria, and just drive all the way to the back, you will see another building and that is where Song Cook's is located.  It is really a big place, and it looks somewhat old, but never mind. We were a big group and we were led into a private room. The guy who served us was so awesome. He would check in on us periodically and when we rang that little bell, he would come. Towards the end of the dinner, he automatically asked us if we wanted separate bills, and without hesitation or an eye roll, proceeded to divide and conquer.  The food, from what I gathered around the table, looked really good. Since I had already eaten, I just got the Sashimi plate but others got the soups and black bean noodles. Fair warning, the portions here are huge...and for the price, you do get your money's worth.  I say this is as authentic as it gets and I wouldn't mind coming here on an empty stomach! Highly recommend for big groups as the food is great and the price is right."}
{"text":"It's my first time visiting this Korean restaurant. The decoration of the restaurant is very authentic. I feel like I am in an Asian place. Randomly, I ordered the following dishes.  Kalbi Ribs on an Iron Plate (score: 5/5) The ribs came on a hot iron plate. The ribs marinated so well. It tastes very delicious. Generally, the ribs taste slightly sweet, the way that I like.   Rice Cake (score: 5/5) It's like made from sticky rice flour. It's very chewy. The sauce is like the soul to the rice cake, it gives flavour to the rice cake. I first thought that it will be spicy because the sauce is red, actually it is only slightly spicy and the sauce tastes slightly sweet at the same time. I enjoy eating the sauce and want to put different kinds of food in the sauce to eat with.  Black Bean Sauce with Noodle (score: 4/5) When I read the menu before I ordered this dish, it said there are beef and seafood in the sauce. But I could hardly find any seafood bits in the sauce at all. Other than that, it doesn't taste bad at all.   I did enjoy everything I had tonight. I would definitely come back for the ribs and the rice cake."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best restaurants in the North York/Richmond Hill area!  I have been going here for the past 3 years and I can honestly say it is definitely one of the better Korean restaurants in the GTA. The staff are some of the most welcoming and friendliest people on earth, the managers and even the owner make an attempt to speak to customers during their meal, I find this personalization very welcoming and puts a warm welcome face to the owners.   The food...: one word... Amazing; the portions are generous so come hungry. The price isn't unreasonable and generally is in the mid range, a bowl of large hearty pork bone soup runs you 6.99 and it is massive. Rice is extra and does have 4 different varieties my goto is the bean, barley and brown rice. The apps are basically a meal in itself with their succulent sohn Mandu dumplings.   By far the tastiest and most tender meat I've ever had is the kalbijim; hearty portions of beef mixed with a delicate sauce a large is quite expensive these deals running you $20 (used to be 11.99).   I have to say I love this place and there aren't many restaurants I keep going back to. But the staff, atmosphere and food keeps me coming back every time.  Definitely highly recommend and a must try if your into Korean food"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. One of the best Korean joints around. Jajangmyun with seafood and pork is a must try, I would definitely encourage you to get it freshly stirfry - it will not disappoint you!   We used the Yelp check in promo of free drink but I think they forgot and charged us anyways. So don't forget to double check your bill before you pay!   Definitely worth the drive from downtown Toronto. You'll expect us back again!"}
{"text":"One of the first Korean restaurants I've been to and I find myself coming back repeatedly.. For good reason.   The staff are very friendly, attentive and the owner (who I believe is an older lady) is always extremely pleasant. The atmosphere is terrific with two sides, either the more typical eating with a table and chairs side or the unconventional (to myself at least) eating on the floor while sitting on a mat side, albeit this side also has a table. If you do choose the latter, the mats are heat capable which is a bonus in colder weather.   Now on to the food! They have the typical dishes that you come to expect from korean restaurants which include JaJangMyun, BiBimBap and KamJaTang just to name a few. I highly recommend their army stew if you're looking for something hearty to fill you up (it sure filled me up). Another favorite of mines is their LA kalbi ribs and their KhanPoungGi (sweet & spicy chicken). I always find my friends and I order more than we can eat and we end up overeating each time.. We never learn. Besides, the food on the surrounding tables are just to tempting to resist!   On a final note, I have nothing more than great things to say about Song Cook's and please do yourself a favor and make your way to one of my favorite Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"So so!the place is a bit crowded n noisy not suitable for families with yonge kids. Can come once in a while when u hv a Korean food appetite.yet lots of other choices!"}
{"text":"I'm going to be so bold as to say that In one night at SongCook's, I learned more about Korean culture, food, wine and people than anyone who has likely every done a lengthy exchange program to the country. There I said it! Obviously, I'm only kidding, but man what an experience last night.  First off, be advised, it's a little tricky to find this spot, so let's mark it off as a hidden gem. If your GPS is going mental trying to find this place, it's located either (depending if you're coming from Yonge or Steeles), towards the back of the Galleria Supermarket (off of Yonge coming southbound) or directly behind Moores (if you're entering off of Steeles).  Now that you've found the place, let's talk seating, hands down, go for the traditional Korean seating, your feet might fall asleep and you may get dead leg from being crossed legged for so long, but it's authentic, heated, and let's be honest, way more fun than a chair - plus, if you slip into a food coma you're only a few inches from the floor for a quick snooze!  Once seated, here is my take on the menu from a white-guys perspective - if it's your first visit, ask lots of question (and of course consult pictures on their yelp page and menu). I'd recommend asking your server what their most popular items are. We had a good idea going in so we decided to order 4-6 menu items that were easy to share, and for 5 people that was way more than enough.  Here is what we ordered: D13 - KamjaTang JunGol - A large sized hot pot of pork bone soup which they bring a burner to the table to warm it up and keep it bubbling. that value for this was incredible, as there was about 4-5 pork bones and more than enough broth to go around for our group. This might be a two person dish if this is all you're having, paired with several menu items it was was perfect for 5 people. My ONLY critique is I like my PBS SPICY and this was flavourful but set off no alarms. Just my preference, but still very good  L2 - KhanPoungGi - similar to a sweet and sour chicken, but so much better. The batter is so crispy! Despite being dredged in their delicious sauce, it maintains it's crisp, fried chicken perfection throughout the entire meal. No wonder their famous for this dish. It's certainly a must have!  N1 - JaJangMyun - These noodles have no end to then, thank goodness for the scissors because you need them to cut off your portion (so your dining companions can have a little bit too). The sauce is incredible and as explained by our new friend Dale (son of the owners) the ground beef is less of the main show, and more of a seasoning. So don't be surprised if you're not getting a ton of beef in this. This dish is all about the fresh house made noodles anyway, so enjoy!  R4 + R5 - White Rice and DolSotBap - It's great to order 2 or more kinds of rice since that have so many variations, so it's great to compare. The White rice is white rice, however the DSB, is the traditional Korean \"purple rice\" which is essentially the fusion of white and black rice which renders a more purple colour. It takes longer to cook as it's prepared in a stone bowl, but don't forget to eat your crispy bits at the end which they soak in water while you eat.  S2 - LA Kalbi - Traditional Korean short ribs, you get three long pieces and a pair of scissors to cut them up. This is easily one of the best Kalbi I've had, ever. Good fat to meat proportion, perfectly marinated and cooked, served sizzling hot.  S10 - Table Cooked SamKyupSal - This is an amazing dish to order for a group, it's a little bit of a show since your server prepares everything table side for you, so for a group it's totally worth while (and delicious). 4-6 huge pieces of pork belly are cooked ona freshly seasoned griddel alongside cooked various mushrooms and onions. This is great on it's own but if you want to be authentically Korean, I'd recommend you pair this with...  S1 - Wrap Vegetables - Korean folk, as I'm told, love their veggies raw so they can wrap their meats in them and add sauces and filler. Kinda like lettuce wraps. You're served a variety of greenery including, romaine, kale and a leaf that escapes my memory but was described as a hybrid cousin of basil and mint, perfect for wrapping meat and rice!  Needless to say we were STUFFED by the end of our meal but somehow managed to eat almost everything on the table. To wash this all down we had a couple bottled of soju (korean rice wine), but the real winner was the Ontario made Soju White-wine combo that they serve here. It starts with a white wine taste on the palate but finishes with soju notes toward the end. Definitely an amazing Canadian innovation that pairs perfectly with a massive Korean meal!  Service and staff were on point and even helped make a messy bill situation go smoothly! I cannot wait to come back again  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times. Always like their black bean noodle and fried dumplings. However, this time they didn't do a good job on the fried spicy chicken. It's so dry and so little meat but the sauce is good. They also give so little plates on side dishes as I like those who gives you so many small dishes before main course :)"}
{"text":"A nice Korean restaurant located right behind Galleria supermarket.  Came here for dinner craving some Korean food (who doesn't?).   Interior was nice and clean, washrooms were clean and waitstaff were friendly and quick.  Menu was a little confusing to navigate but after a bit of contemplating I decided to order the small portion of Kalbi jjim ($12). But immediately was a little peeved that I had to pay $2 extra for a side of white rice... (other more healthy rice choices available at a premium, such as barley rice and some purple rice)  My friend ordered the jajangmyun + mandu (dumpling) combo.  After placing our order the sidedishes came... nice. The kimchi was really good! however not much selection in the sidedishes, only some pickled radish, kimchi and some spicy jelly thing.  When the main dish came, I was pleasantly surprised, have to say this was one of the BEST kalbijjim I've ever had. Can't find anything bad to say about it even if I tried.  I could eat this 3x a day for a month and not get bored of it.  I think I've said enough about the kalbijjim, onto the jajangmyun and dumplings. The jajangmyun was ok, I've had better but none the less it was a pretty good deal since you also got dumplings...and they were some tasty dumplings!  Overall rating I would give the kalbijjim 5 stars (seriously, try it) but restaurant overall I would say 3 and half (round up to 4stars!)  OH and don't forget to check in on yelp, you get a free pop!"}
{"text":"Food 3.5/5 (50% of final grade)   Ordered:   YuSeul Jjajang (Seafood Black Bean Noodles) 2.5*/5   Stir Fried Octopus 2.5/5    Mul Neang Myun (Buckwheat Cold Noodles) 4/5  This dish was amazingly refreshing and light. After about half of it I got really parched though, so I guess the sodium content must have been higher than usual to compensate for the coldness and how low temperatures affect taste.   Cham Pong (Spicy Seafood Noodles) 2/5 This dish was very basic and really consisted mostly of salt and nothing else. I didn't even taste the spiciness over the saltiness! The texture of the noodles, however, was quite nice bouncy.   Big Bowl BiBimBap (Mixed Vegetables  with pork and egg on rice) 3.5/5 A large silver bowl with an assortment of shiitake mushrooms, thinly cut carrots, soybean sprouts, seaweed, and lettuce seasoned with sesame oil and salt on plain white rice. Add the red pepper paste to taste. This entree was deceptively simple, yet simply delicious! The Big Bowl BimBimBap was large enough to feed three people, hands down.   Five Spices JokBal (Sliced Pork) 2/5 This was bland to my tastes.   Pork Bone Soup 2.5*/5 Snack Size TangSuYuk (Sweet and Sour Pork) and KhanPoungGi (Sweet and Spicy Pork) 2.5*/5  2.5*/5   Wrap Vegetables 2/5 This was literally just an assortment of really fresh raw lettuce, kale, and perilla leaves. *2.5/5 is when a dish is simply at par with MY knowledge of the industry average, so it may or may not be accurate. I can vouch a little and say that my Korean food tasting is above average though, since I've cooked this sort of cuisine myself, and I've been to quite a few Korean food places after watching many korean dramas.  Ambiance 3.5/5 (15% of final grade) I specifically booked the traditional seating area, because that was a novelty to me. It was surprisingly comfortable! The tables and floors in the seating area were very clean. You have to take off your shoes to step onto the seating area though, which I thought was very quirky and novel. The atmosphere was surprisingly accommodating for both large groups and small groups, or even individual diners. The lighting was at a comfortable brightness where everyone still felt as if they were at a cozy joint, yet maintained a nice air of tradition.  Service 3.5/5 (15% of final grade) I went with another 9 of my family members, with 4 children under the age of 10, so you could imagine how crazy it was with dropping water cups and running children. Our server was extremely friendly though, and came very quickly every time water was spilled. I couldn't decide what to get, so I decided to get the help of the server, who was VERY enthusiastic about explaining his experience of other customers' preferences (EXCELLENT product knowledge!). He basically put together our menu! I originally ordered a large TanSuYuk instead of the two snack sized porks, but then I pulled him back to tell him about how I wanted to try both, so he recommended the snack sizes. He came back after the dishes were served and asked us how we felt about the portion sizes, and I honestly told him that I was expecting something bigger for its price. Surprisingly, he agreed wholeheartedly and offered to supersize our next order of the porks for the night for free, if we wanted to order more. I politely declined this offer though, because we ordered quite a bit of food. It was a very nice gesture of his to comment on the portion sizes though. In general, this is a very family-friendly restaurant. The only reason I didn't give service a 4 was because they accidentally charged me for the large sized TangSuYuk (and I only realized when I got home). That's an extra $18.99 + tax + tip!! I quickly called them to explain my situation, and they were apologetic, but happy to arrange a time to my convenience to reverse this though, so there isn't much to complain about that except that it was a small slip-up. The server was probably slightly distraught over the loudness of the children anyway (my family consists of VERY outgoing children).  Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade) Not much can be really said about the cost-- it's a pretty standard Korean place for dinner in terms of pricing. SOME portions did err on the smaller side though. SOME.   Other 3.5/5 (10% of final grade) The general tolerance the staff had for the children in the family was very comforting, especially for large families like mine. It could be quite difficult to dine out when the servers are eyeing the children negatively, but it was great that this didn't happen here at all! One of the young lady servers was pushing a small cart of dishes when two of my little nieces rushed in front. She let out a nice smile and said Hi to the girls instead of kissing her teeth like most servers would. It wasn't only her though, as smiles were frequent from the staff!  Final Grade = 68/100 = 3 Stars!  TLDR: Neat little restaurant. The traditional Korean seating where you sit on the ground was very cute! Try the Cold Noodles!"}
{"text":"Nostalgic. Don't remember many places with floor seating but this was one of them. If you don't feel adventurous or just hit the gym before going you can just sit on a chair in their other dining area. The floor seating is heated in the winter.   You get minimal side dish, kimchi and radish only, though the kimchi was pretty big they had to give us a pair of scissors. I would go for their spicier dishes (army stew, rice cakes) as they were the ones that stood out of the bunch (don't go for chicken cutlet, just go to Galleria if you really want some). Purple/brown rice option is a dollar extra, so no.  I went several times and every time the food and service was good. One of the male server even went above and beyond separating our bills into six different tabs with some complicated math equation halves thirds quarters."}
{"text":"We arrived an hour before closing so most of the items were already sold out.  So decided on the JaJeng Myun, TangSuYuk & KhanPoungGi.  Overall very good food and price is on par with other Korean places in area.  Service was quick and servers were attentive as well.  Only thing I didn't like was the limited amount of side dishes.  I do not know it they were closing soon or it was normal what I got.  Will have to come back earlier next time and try the stuff they ran out of."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!! The service is top notch. The food is as authentic as it can get, and very tasty!!! Kimchi was made in house. It used to be very good but since they get crowded the kimchi is not as fermented as it can be best. But I will definitely go back for more"}
{"text":"Came here on the urging of my husband as we saw this place on Eat Here. I am glad we did. Lovely decor, great device and the food was amazing. We had steamed dumplings and spring rolls to start, really good, my 7 year old loved them both. Then we had the bimbap for 2, again really good and we also ordered their signature chilli chicken dish which was so good, but alas... so much food. Come here for Korean. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good Korean restaurant in Toronto and I found it here! I love how they have floor seating in one area of the restaurant, it's very beautiful. As for food, I got bibimbap, dumplings and a seafood pancake which were all excellent. Also, extra points for he amazing KPOP! I can't wait to take my family back here as well as my friends!"}
{"text":"I love song cook's. I probably go about once every other month. I have sat in both the floor section and chairs sections in every season. I love the heated floors in the winter. My guy friends do not like the heated floors because it can get quite hot but I love it!   This is a great restaurant for families and groups. I am often a fan of the combo dinners because it has a lot of variety of food, big portions, and is much cheaper than ordering individual entrees.  The staff is very attentive at keeping the restaurant clear and safe (always arranging shoes neatly and mopping), which I find a great aspect to any busy restaurant.   I do wish the washroom stalls were a little bigger, they are very small.   Overall, this restaurant provides a great experience for anyone, and is unique to the GTA."}
{"text":"I haven't been here many times, but every time has left me satisfied and craving more. Korean food is largely still a mystery to me due to my inability to handle much spice, but the extensive menu here allows me to try a few more dishes than usual. Highlights of my visits include army stew and their jajiang noodles. The army stew is really not rocket science - if it comes down to it I'd describe it as a university student's lazy dinner for two. But a good balance of all the ingredients and lots of soup makes for a hearty classic meal at a budget - with that Korean spice kick. Jajiang noodles come in many varieties with whatever toppings you're looking for - seafood, beef, veggie, you name it! Lots and lots of sauce to go with your noodles, also a favourite of mine. As always, tons of refillable side dishes to satisfy and complement your meal. Their dumplings were pretty good as well - an excellent appetizer if you need something of substance.  On the weekends this place is packed - if you're looking for chair and table seating the wait could be upwards an hour. If you're flexible for traditional kneeling seating, you could be luckier but don't count on it - at least a forty minute wait. It's not that the service is slow but that the restaurant is just that popular - lots of families and large groups, and no reservations allowed. If you're making the trip come early or bring patience!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, both for dinner and for lunch. I've had the jajangmyun, jajangmyun + mandu(dumpling) combo, and the bulgogi combo. I did enjoy the jajangmyun, and for those who've had the Chinese version, this is quite different with the korean version being much sweeter and with less meat than the Chinese one.  Overall I enjoyed the jajangmyun, and I think getting it as a combo with the mandu is the best deal, since the amount of noodles you get doesn't get decreased by much AND you get to eat something else with it, so it won't get boring.  What brought down the marks is the bulgogi dish I had. I didn't find it to be anything special, and I don't feel like Song Cook did anything to make it different from a Chinese stir fry. Also, I wish there were more banchans like other Korean places offer. Here you only get kimchi and pickled radish, so for people like me who aren't too fond of kimchi, your options are limited to just that of the radish  Service I think is pretty great. I'm also particularly pleased with the cleanliness of the place. Overall, I think this is a good place, but there might be better/cheaper Korean food along Yonge street in my opinion."}
{"text":"Slowest services ever. My family and I were one of six families waiting for about half an hr for a server to even come by. That, plus the fact that they forgot to serve us one of our dishes and then tried to make us pay for it was enough to make me never come back again."}
{"text":"Been coming here for family dinner. They serve great Korean food. I really wish they can add more table seating and get rid of some of the floor seating area. Easy to find parking and friendly servers. Just like all other Korean places you need to call for a server tho."}
{"text":"Service was good!   Food was good too.  The plus side is that it's right next to Galleria.  So get your Korean food then get your Asian groceries!!!   ????? : 7/10"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance that lends itself to a feeling of being in the in the old country. The exposed beams and floor seating made me optimistic about the experience. We ordered a Dolsot Bi Bum Bap but made the request to substitute beef with tofu. After some back and forth with the kitchen, it was decided that there would be a dollar charge. Not a big deal, but because the charge was arbitrary (as in some times they charge and sometimes they don't), it kind of felt like they were penalizing the customer (not a good way to win business). I spoke to the manager about how this, noting that I found this restaurant through Yelp and that this review I would give my feedback on this site.  I also suggested that their vegetarian options include more popular dishes, such as as Bi Bum Bap,   Side dishes were limited (kimchi, bean sprouts, one other dish that I don't know the name of). Pre cooked syam gup sal was okay (fatty, and could be cooked more).  When I first sat down, I was convinced I would be a regular, by the end of the meal I was convinced it was my last time."}
{"text":"This place seemed pretty authentic. Of all my dining days in North York, the Korean places i went to were small and had maybe 5 items on the menu. Or there were part of another asian restuarant. It was refreshing to see other items on the menu besides bibimbap. Though that's what we did get. and Kalbi. Because KALBI is the best! and this place makes them pretty good, not overcooked and tiny.   We were just the two of us, but ended up ordering food for four :-) #fattiesforlife. Needless to say I threw a fried egg on my leftover noodles and had it for brunch today.   It was tough to catch a server to serve us, but once we did the experience was great! They were polite and patient and addressed all our requests...  Especially the one about getting two orders of the EXTRA crazy spicy sauce.. apparently the kitchen gave them  a weird look too. Be warned. ITS REALLY SPICY. but so worth adding a drop to your food for that yummy burn.  I don't think I'll be back just because it's so far out but I did recommend it to friends in the area who have all been there and enjoyed it equally!"}
{"text":"It's a nice setting and the servers are friendly and speak English. Ample parking and they take credit cArd. Free soda with yelp check in  My main complaint is that some of the dishes are very overpriced. In particular we got the meal for two which is $40. Comes with galbi, soup and rice. The rice and soup sell for under $10 combined I think. Which means we are paying over 30 for the galbi. For that price, we expected something substantial and delicious. It was quite tasty, but we were definitely hungry after.   I'll definitely be back, but I'll stick to the more reasonably priced items"}
{"text":"Time to get my feet wet and try Korean cuisine! SongCook's boasts Authentic Korean dishes with both regular table seating and low traditional tables where you sit on the floor. The menu is extensive and we were all new. Where to start?!    We started by asking our server. We had a lot of questions which caught the attention of the manager, Dale. He quickly jumped in to help us choose the right dishes and not too many for our group. We started with a Korean drink, Soju. We got a bottle of Wine Soju and Chamisul Soju. Soju is a Korean Rice alcohol. The Wine Soju is VQA and made in Ontario. Who knew? It tasted like white wine with a twist. A delightful drink to have with dinner. Soju straight is much like vodka, but not quite. It's quite strong! SongCook has a large variety of Soju for you to try.    After all of us reading reviews, there were a few things we needed to try. The first one on the list was Pork Bone Soup. The server brought a burner to our table to keep the heaping pot of soup warm. It was meaty with green beans, bean sprouts and potatoes. It was a little spicy, but it didn't overwhelm the amazing flavour of the actual soup.     Another must was Kalbi Short Ribs. They were so tender, meaty and addicting, I don't know how we were able to share them without stealing from each other's plates. Next time, I want a whole plate to myself!    When you see a mount of Korean Fried Chicken at your table, don't hide your huge grin. I never thought the 5 of us would finish it, but we did, easily. When I didn't think I had room, I made an exception for this. The sauce was more sour than sweet and the batter was like no other. The batter was thin and crispy around pieces of juicy chicken. More please.    When a bowl arrived filled with black sauce, I was instantly worried....WTH is that?! When someone else started dishing it out, I was relieved to see it was a bowl of housemade noodles topped with black bean sauce and ground beef, JaJangMyum. Still worried, I took a small portion and soon realized I would be having seconds. The black bean sauce had a little sweetness to it; it was great! The noodles were so long we had to cut them with scissors!    When I see Pork Belly on a menu, you know I won't be far from Iit. They brought a grill to our table, place strips of pork belly, onion and mushrooms on it to cook as well as a plate of greens to wrap those grilled treats in. Nothing like pork belly hot off the grill. It doesn't get any fresher than that!    Purple Rice! I didn't know what it was either! It's a mix of white rice and black rice cooked in a stone bowl. It does take longer to arrive, but it's worth the wait. I'll never order white rice again. It's got great flavour and texture, but not to overwhelm the food, but to accent it. This will be your new favourite. Try it!    This was a fantastic visit. We learned so much about Korean food, cooking methods, ingredients and more. Dale was great and spent much time with us and our many questions. The servers were fantastic, always trying to make room on our table for more.    I'd love to come back here and try more!"}
{"text":"Defy five star ???Best service ever !Everyoneare soooo passion and sweet ?LOVVVVVE????"}
{"text":"I always love to sit at the heated seats area, though someone might find it annoying to take off the shoes. But in the winter time, I get so warm sitting at the table while drinking delicious hot soup :) Portion is big, so we always order a few things and share among us to take a taste of everything. Seafood pancake is yummy but make sure you eat when it's hot!"}
{"text":"Second time here, both times it was a freezing cold night. You can chose to to be seated in the regular seating area or the heated floors but you'll have to remove your shoes. Tonight I picked the floor as I sat in the regular seats last time.   I came here for their specialty handmade seafood noodle. But this this I opted for the JaJang noodle combo so I get a taste of both and they were equally awesome! If you check in you get a free pop too.   I will definitely have to come back to try other dishes instead of just ordering the seafood noodle every time."}
{"text":"Hidden is a plaza but definitely very spacious. This Korean restaurant is slightly louder than the usual but provides somewhat a better service than several other Korean restaurants in the area. Servers are friendly, professional and efficient. Atmosphere is relatively kept clean with an odd choice of interior design/decor.. (the chandelier kind of clashes with the rest) The food on the other hand is savoury and tastes a little better than the average Korean restaurant. It can get crowded on weekends so make reservations in advance."}
{"text":"Service/Access  Everyone is really nice when the place isn't too busy. In other words, start coming before 7pm and you will be pleasantly surprised. Once the restaurant is hit with lines of customers, you can expect slower service (not that it's bad) but you will need to get the server's attention for tea/water refills. The place is conveniently located beside Galleria Supermarket so you can go FML to parking. There are actually lots of parking spots but the ones close to Song Cook's are usually taken. You can drive or TTC to this place, both works well.  Food Pork belly with veggies  This costs a total of $15 and is considered an appetizer. Hands down BEST DISH in this restaurant. I order this every time I come. The pork belly needs to be dipped in the yellow/salty sauce then once it's in your mouth, grab the thicker brown sauce with your chop sticks and put it in your mouth. My instructions are really bad but you will understand soon enough. A MUST TRY!  Jajang  I don't remember which one it was (they have several kinds). Very thick sauce - it is meant to be shared with others.  Pancake  This is actually a little too thick for my liking though my friends loved it.  Bibimbap  It was so big lol, totally worth every penny. The dish is more warm than \"hot\" - if you want that kind of bibimbap, you are looking for the stone pot one.  I was very torn with what to give this place. They have both good and bad aspects. To start, not all their dishes are spectacular but at the same time nothing is horrible. Their service is average yet they never seem to disappoint. I'm impressed with their website and DAMN that pork belly is just too delicious. One major complaint is that they have limited side dishes. If you judge on food quality alone, there are too many other restaurants that shine above. But if you factor in the whole package, it's quite consistent with service/food/atmosphere. I can totally understand why so many people come here, in fact I've been here more than 2 times already."}
{"text":"I had heard of something called jjajangmyeon, but never had the chance to try it. Decided to look up a place to try and the first place that came up on yelp was Songcook.  A little further away from home for me, but somehow ended up in the area, so figured why not pop in and try it out. The entrance was in the corner so the large interior and cute decorations to reflect the Korean culture was to nice see!  I got the Jjajangmyeon combo with GuManDu, and was quite happy with the choice. The noodles were delicious and the sauce was heaven! Always knew what it was, but he experience was just so great! The ManDu were nicely done as well!  Definitely an awesome place with many options! The check-in offer for a pop was also a solid plus! Worth taking a look and coming back."}
{"text":"We had the 5-people-set combo, the black bean sauce noodles was really good, it was quite soft and the sauce was sweet. My second favourite dish was that sweet and sour chicken, the sweet and sour sauce was very good. The sashimi salad and beef bones were good too. We almost cleaned up everything.  Recommend: black bean sauce noodles."}
{"text":"Very good, authentic Korean food. I would say it is the best in the Yonge and Steeles/Finch area. It's not the cheapest but you get good value for your money due to the large portion sizes. The servers don't all speak English well but the service is not bad. The pork bone soup and the Jap Chae noodles are quite good."}
{"text":"I went here last night for my sister's birthday. We chose this restaurant based on their countless positive reviews and we were not disappointed! Staff were extremely friendly, great environment, fair prices, all the dishes were delicious with the exception of the LA Kalbi, it was a bit dry. We ordered the seafood pancake (perfectly crispy), sweet and spicy chicken (my favourite dish so far), a giant noodle dish which I don't remember the name but it seemed to never end. Noodles are made fresh in house daily! We also got a tofu soup and a pork bone soup which I didn't try any but my sister said it was delicious. Lastly, we ordered the rice cakes which I've always hated (not at this restaurant but just rice cakes in general) but it's my sister's favourite dish and she said it was great so it must be! The staff brought out my sister's cake and sang Happy Birthday to her which was very cute because they're all so friendly in a I'm-having-dinner-at-my-friends-house kinda way. We were told they used to be associated with the Song Cook in Mississauga but they've parted ways a while back. They're owned by two different owners now. I've yet to try the Mississauga location which is in my neighbourhood but I honestly don't mind the drive to Vaughan when the food is this great!"}
{"text":"It has been a LONG time since I had good Kanpungi and a friend of mine has been raving about it from this place for a while. I finally decided to come here after work with my wife a couple of weeks ago.  Based on the hype, I have to say that I was disappointed. I won't say it was bad, it was fine, it was even goodish, but it wasn't great and it definitely wasn't the best.  We actually ordered a LOT of food so we had a good selection to review. Ultimately, all the food was good but not great. A little disappointing was the small selection of Banchan that came out with the meal; normally it's nice to get a good broad selection but here they only offered three different types. At least the portions were big!  I would like to give this place a 3.5 but with the prices actually being  surprisingly high for this kind of place and in comparison to the quality, I, unfortunately, have to give it a sold 3."}
{"text":"Love that this place is open late and has a large variety of korean food. Service was fast. Food was hot and tasty. If you check in on yelp, theres a free soft drink with your purchase. Ordered jajung and jaeyuk bokkum which tasted delicious!  Unfortunately there were so many flies hovering around our food that it ruined the atmosphere while eating."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here so many times, i cant believe I haven't reviewed it yet This is our go-to Korean neighborhood restaurant. Everything here is good! We always get the beef stew, black noodles, bibimbap, seafood pancake, grilled mackerel, chicken katsu. I can go on and on...its full of korean customers too so you know its good!"}
{"text":"tried their cold noodle menu. i didn't expect it to be so flavourful, but that's what it exactly it's not. noodle and soup combine well to create very tasty taste that's refreshing for hot summer day."}
{"text":"amazing food, EXTRAORDINARY service. Very impressed!!! Will definitely go back again and again."}
{"text":"Delicious as always.  Been here maybe 5 times now and everytime has always been good.  Staff is friendly and service is quick.  Will highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"If you want a spacious, clean Korean restaurant to go to host larger groups or families, this is the place to go to. Though the location is hard to find (behind Galleria mall) it's worth it. Also very ample parking. Food is authentic and you can choose to sit in normal seats or the the traditional way cross-legged on mats. My family enjoys coming here. The dishes that are a must are the seafood pancake, sweet and sour fried chicken, and the dolsat bibimbap. Sizes of main dishes are large and great for communal eating."}
{"text":"I'm more impressed with the level and service and decor than anything.  I came here for a very quick dinner of pork bone soup. $6, good price! I told the server that I was in a bit of a rush, and the soup came out really soon after that. I was impressed. The soup itself was okay, the broth could have done with more flavour. The meat was very tender and delicious, though.   I enjoyed the side dishes, but yes, they're just kimchee and radish. They were pretty good, though.   All in all, not a bad dining experience."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new place to get some Korean food and came across this place. Came here on a Monday on Boxing Day and decided on this place. From the outside, it just looks to be a place at the end of a plaza, but upon waking in you are presented with an entirely different atmosphere. For seating, it looks like there are two available options. There is the traditional sit down where you sit cross-legged at a table raised from the floor, have your shoes down on the floor. Or they have regular table seating which is what I opted for.   The wait time wasn't too bad. Took about 10-15 minutes with no reservation, but it looks like the place is pretty popular and usually takes reservations. Got sat down by our waiter and quickly got our Korean side dishes. For starters we got Kimchi, Turnip, Bean Sprouts, and also Bean Curd. We got our order quite quickly after ordered shortly after getting our appetizers and had hot tea offered at the get go.   Ordered some Tteokbokki, Gamjatang, Spicy Seafood Soup, Dolsot Bibimbap, and Jajangmyeon.  Tteokbokki: Starting with the Rice Cakes they were cooked well to the perfect consistency and had a good sourish tomato based sauce to go with it. The Rice Cakes also had a hard boiled egg and some bean curd which went well with the sauce.   Gamjatang: The Pork Bone soup bowl consisted mainly of a couple of pieces of Pork Bone that took up most of the sizzling bowl. I thought that having the Pork Bone made the broth provide a good burst of flavor as every sip was taken. The bean sprouts and green onion with the soup provided a little bit of a crunch to the taste. Had an excellent addition to brown rice ordered that was ordered.  Spicy Seafood Soup: The seafood soup came in a sizzling presentation looked really good. From other places where I have gotten seafood soup, I felt that it could have had a bit more to offer when it came to seafood. There was a mussel or two, a few bay shrimp, and a few pieces of squid. The soup had the flavor enriched by the seafood but needed the rice to make it a fulfilling dish.  Dolsot Bibimbap: The bibimbap came in really hot and had a little bit of beef on the side. The dish had a nice egg on the top to dispersed throughout the dish with mushrooms, carrots, cucumber, shredded seaweed, and shredded lettuce. Very much a balanced bowl and would be a great recipe to get as an all in one entree.  Jajangmyeon: The Black Bean noodles came in with the noodles, sauce, and cucumber. Quite a potent dish and maybe a little too potent in Black Bean Sauce. They were quite good, but the dish tasted like it had a little bit too much salt.  Overall from my experience from the place the service was excellent, meals were adequate. The only thing was the price was a little bit steep for the meat. Most of the meat dishes ranged from $20-$60. Do I recommend this place? Yes to try at least once and get a pretty traditional experience, but the price is a little higher than other Korean restaurants. I would rate this place a 4 out of 5 due to the price."}
{"text":"Standard Korean fare.  They only give you two side dishes, and if you don't like kimchi, then you won't like either of them.  The pork bone soup is one of the better ones in Toronto.  The waiters don't really understand English, I think this restaurant is catered to  Koreans.  Quite difficult to find, and it's packed on weekends. I don't think I would come back - not really a memorable experience."}
{"text":"I like the restaurant ambiance eventhough they were still renovating, still looked orderly. I loved the heated sit down traditional dining. food was good, we were served 2nd plates of banchan! rice is not included with Gamjatangs (8.99) but generous portions of meat I would good back!"}
{"text":"SongCook is not your traditional Korean restaurant. The interior and exterior of the restaurant is beautifully decorated and it's very spacious. There's a room where you can dine in on regular seats and the other side for traditional Korean seating (why I chose this place). My friends and I did not get the option of picking and everyone was sitting on the regular seats.  The menu is very extensive and organized. I got the sashimi bibimbap and they give you a healthy amount of the salmon and tilapia along with lots of delicious and thinly sliced vegetables and rice you can add on the side. The hot pepper sauce was nothing too special - but still delicious.  Service was good as well but it is worth mentioning that the food here is certainly more expensive than other family owned (smaller) restaurants. For example, their pork bone soup would be about ~$9 but you have to pay extra for the rice. They have lots of rice options but I believe the rice should be included with the price of the soup as well as in many other restaurants.  I had a good experience here!"}
{"text":"Great Korean food for the price. I've had almost everything on the menu. Nothing really stands out but everything is pretty good. Love the combo plates. My wife loves the stone bowl fish eggs and cold water buckwheat noodles (it comes with a slice of watermelon - crazy!!) The service is hit and miss but tolerable.  We're at the Mississauga location most of the time but recently went to the North York location, which feels like a much bigger space (could be the high ceilings). Great place to bring your non-Korean friends (or even your Korean friends) to show what Korean foods all about.  The restaurant is a little difficult to located. Hint - it's behind the Moores store."}
{"text":"A family suggestion for this place for Korean food. We like the atmosphere when we first walked in because of the decor and one section of is low table sittings. NICE! But we didn't get an option to sit there. BOO! The place didn't look packed (arrived around 7pm)... we were told at first we have to wait even though we still see many empty tables. Another waiter then gave us a table at the front by the stage with big giant tv. (It Looks like they do offer some karaoke nights.)  Their menu has lots of pictures. I find a bit hard to understand. There are many options to choose... wish someone could explain their famous dish to us or their option for rice upgrade.  We ordered 4 dishes and they were all delicious. The japchae is quiet expensive $26,99 for a large plate and no option for small plate. Pork bone soup is good but I find it is missing a flavor (Owl of Minerva has more flavor). We also ordered Dolsotbibimbap and mulneanmyun. It was good but I wish they would explain what kind of sauce can put in it.   I would come back next time with a Korean friend who can show us how to eat some dishes... or explain some menu items.   I would give 4 stars but because of their service that evening... only 3 stars for this visit. Just saying... Most of the Korean restaurant we've been, the waiters says \"Gamsahamnida\" when we leave the place. This visit makes us feel they are rushing us out."}
{"text":"Traditional korean house decoration which i enjoyed, and the menu looks like it would attract many foreigners. We should've tried their signature dishes such as stone bowl rice, cuz their on-table pork belly was disappointing. You need to purchase the vegetable..?!"}
{"text":"This place is meh. It's a pretty average korean place. Nothing really stood out to us and it was kind of a drive for us. This place is also more expensive than other similar korean restaurants I've been to. Spicy rice cakes are sweeter than what I normally eat. It had a stronger taste of tomato sauce/ketchup.  We ordered the chicken soup. This is a healthier dish so the broth should have mellow-er flavour. Even so, we thought it was watery and lacked any flavour it's suppose to have. Also we thought the chicken was smaller than other places and other places offers a whole chicken for a cheaper price.    Sweet and spicy chicken is a large main dish that we shared. We also ordered rice to go with it. I like how they had different types of rice you can choose from and we went with the white rice. The chicken was fried nicely that it was crispy even coated in the sweet and spicy sauce. The dish also had water chestnut and pineapples that offered good flavours. This is the only dish I really liked, maybe because it's fried and is covered in sauce? You can't go wrong with this dish."}
{"text":"Dunch with my friend here. Food is so so, nothing special. Environment is good, but service is pretty slow. Definitely we won't come back again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Korean restaurants. I have been here 4 times as of now and haven't been disappointed yet.   I'm not Korean but based on the sheer number of Korean people going to this place, I'd say the food must be pretty authentic. Every time I went, I had to wait a few minutes. And it's a big place too. About half the restaurant has normal seats and the other half is the \"take off your shoes and sit on the elevated floor kind\". It's nice because the elevated floor is heated. The restaurant is also the most \"authentically\" decorated Korean restaurant I've seen in GTA.   If you can't read Korean, this restaurant's specialty is the stone pot rice (just rice). They have the basic for just about $3.50. They scope the rice from the stone pot for you and then pour water in the stone pot which you can eat later. You can add some herbs to it or change the type of rice. I've yet to see other restaurants do this. Of course, you probably want something to go with the rice. You can get good old bibimbap or other stone pot based rice dishes.   If you don't want rice, they also have decent selection of Korean food that you recognize. Pork belly is good. They also have LA Kalbi (beef ribs), grilled fish, bulgogi, pork bone soup. All of which are quite decent from my experience.   For something truly traditional, try their Chicken Ginseng Soup. I went with a Korean friend. I don't think this item is actually on the menu. This was really good and decently priced.   My only complaint with this restaurant is the lack of side dishes. You only get one plate of raddish and kimchi. Nothing else. I can easily overlook this because their main dishes are decently priced. I'd imagine they need to raise prices by $1-$2 per main dish if they want to serve other side dishes.   Overall, the combination of decent prices, real Korean atmosphere, and good quality food makes this one of my top choices for Korean food."}
{"text":"After hearing so many people talk about how delicious the food is here, I've decided to try it with my hubby.  Decor: They have a Korean-style dining section where you sit on the floor with your legs crossed :). Pretty cool.   Service: Came here during lunch today so there were not as much customers. Worked out for us because our food came pretty quick. We were hungry so I was happy :).   Food: I had the Bulgoki which was delicious. It's pretty much grilled marinated beef with vegetables. Yummmmm. I wanna come back and try other dishes :)"}
{"text":"I love their pork belly with onions. So juicy and yummy...not too fatty! I also like their side dishes...the Kimchi is really good! I don't usually eat Kimchi in other Korean restaurants...but this kimchi is so tasty and not too spicy! They also have pickled radish and bean sprouts as their side dishes. The soups are also good..great portions.   Service is great. Staff are friendly and they attend to your needs immediately. They are generous with the side dishes. They ask you if you want more side dishes. They also give you more tea. Very friendly and professional.    The only downside is that you pay extra for rice and lettuce wraps. The dishes aren't pricey on their own but it adds up when you order the rice and the wraps."}
{"text":"The first time I came, I ordered the pork bone soup. It was fantastic - came to me super hot, meat was fresh and soup was delicious. However, rice was only available as a separate order which sucks because other places offer rice with their PBS. Even though I didn't get my rice, I could have easily gave them 3-4 stars based on the quality of their food.  Tonight, my second visit to Songcook and the food don't lie! I entered the restaurant only to find myself on the wait list, but was only 10 mins wait. Fast forward and I got my table, close to the renovating side. It was empty in that section, so I didn't understand why I needed to wait. I ordered the spicy fried pork chop with rice and miso soup. This was easily one of the best $16 meal I've had in a while. It was ginormous, not to mention super delicious and flavourful! The spiciness  was not overwhelming and it had a tang to it. The pork chop was fried with the spicy sauce doused all over. I took my first bite and it was so juicy and crunchy.. I thought I was in pork heaven in that moment. The crunchiness was short lived due to the sauce, but the first few bites made this meal all worth it! The sauce also had pineapples, red bell peppers and baby corn in it, which added more to the flavour.. In awe!  The service don't lie also - it was just as professional and friendly as my first visit. Like I said before, I sat in the section of the restaurant where the renovation is still taking place, so the wait staff didn't come that often (kind of bugged me a little). However, when they did come around, they were very polite and was genuine about helping us. That right there deserves top marks for me.  No matter how good a place is, there has to be some kind of flaw. I think for me tonight was the washroom. Yes, it gets busy here but things still need to be cleaned. The washroom was quite a mess, but still bearable. It wasn't a very pleasant visit.. What's the point of having a clean restaurant when the exterior and interior aren't in sync with each other? If the seating area is clean, so should the washrooms and kitchen (not saying I saw the kitchen though).  I think I can give Songcook a very solid 4.5 stars. I took off 0.5 based on the cleanliness of the washroom. Great job guys, keep it up.. 5 stars for my next visit...... To the washroom haha"}
{"text":"I've decided to check out Song Cook's as I have read amazing reviews about it.  Depending where you park, Song Cook's might be hard to find. It is in the same plaza as the Moores clothing store, but keep walking inside the plaza as it is behind the Moores.  Song Cook's was really big and tons of seating. However, I was surprised when they did not have those call buttons as most big Korean restaurants do.  After ordering, our side dishes were given, along with extra utensils like small bowls, scissors and thongs. Our waitress who was really nice and sweet also gave an egg and the bottled sauce for our dish. To be frank, I had no idea half of what the dishes were. I just knew that the one next to the beansprouts has fishcakes and those were yum. The kimchi slices were big and huge (which I guess that's what the scissors are for) and tasted great too.  At Song Cook's, they had a lunch menu between 11AM to 3PM, I believe. We made it there around 1PM.  My friend, U, ordered from the lunch menu and got the JaJangBap - which was rice with minced meat, black sauce, vegetables and an egg.  She did not enjoy it as much as she thought the sauce would have been separated and not mixed in with the meat. She's also not a fan of sauces in general. I tried the black sauce - it was tangy and slightly sweet. I found it good but I'm not sure if I couldhv consistently ate it for my entire meal as well.  I ordered my usual - Soondubu with kimchi and pork. They also had a seafood soondubu and a kimchi and tuna soondubu. I've never seen a tuna soondubu before, it was interesting.  Rice here has to be ordered separately from the meal, ranging from $3-$4. They have several options for the type of rice, including white rice, brown rice, barley rice, stone pot rice (aka the purple rice and this option will take longer to make). I opted for the brown rice as I'm used to having rice with my soondubu. However, I barely finished half of my rice as I found the texture too hard for me, even with the soup.  We ordered the sashimi salad to share because I've been craving sushi slightly and pictures of it looked good so we impulsively ordered it. The bottled sauce went well with the salad. I wish they hadn't given us the salad on a flat plate because it was hard to kind of mix the salad with the sauce. Perhaps a bowl next time wouldhv been better, but the presentation was good.  When we wanted the bill, it took us awhile because either there wasn't any servers in our corner or they didn't see our hands up.  Overall, I found Song Cook's to be alright. Service was great, our waitress was very nice and friendly. The soondubu here is second to my ultimate favourite Buk Chang Dong Soondubu, but amongst of all the other Korean restaurants - their soondubu was definitely 2nd of my list, it was amazing and it definitely hit the spot. It's a downside for me that I had to pay for my rice separately as compared to Buk Chang Dong. They should really invest in those call buttons as I believe it'll really help both customers and their servers in efficiency.  Nonetheless, I had a good time here (can't say the same for my friend) but might not come back due to the location. This location is out of my way for me as Yonge/Finch is a closer distance to get my Korean food fix."}
{"text":"This is not one of those Chinese owned pseudo Korean and Japanese places, this is the real thing. I don't know a lot of Korean food, but if it offers more than your standard bulgolgi, bimbimbap and kalbi, I think it's got the right idea.   The place is located in a plaza, you wouldn't know it was there unless you were looking for it.  It seems like it used to be something else before - high ceilings and a bar that looks like it belonged in a banquet hall.  Service was good and attentive, but I don't really like seeing employees chat blatantly especially the manager joining in that was non-work related. Regardless, the service was nothing to complain about.   There's some on the floor tables, sitting cross legged  - this was a nice change and seemed like a much nicer area to eat then the main dining area.  Based on others reviews, we chose the Crispy Rice with Soup (large) and the Black Bean Noodles.  They both came out of the kitchen amazingly fast, meaning it was prepared before hand, however, if you notice everything else on the menu seems to be variations of both of these. They were really good both of them, but seems like there's a lot of corn starch as a thickening agent in both dishes. but again, I don't know anything about korean food.   I was dispapointed that there wasn't a lot of the small dishes given like it most other restaurants. Only kimchi and a small bitefull of japchae and pickled veggies.    We shared both dishes (2 of us) and it was more than enough to keep us full. Now that I know what these basic dishes taste like, I'm looking forward to coming back for more!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night. I was craving  the army stew. The stew itself was way too salty we couldn't even eat it! We told one of the waiters and he told us he can make it less salty but we didn't want to risk and and just asked him to make us another stew. So we went ahead and got the seafood tofu stew instead. After a couple bites of the seafood soup we just left and we're not coming back. The stew was not good at all. The flavors were just not on point! It was very disappointing!"}
{"text":"I came here with my friends earlier this evening for dinner. There wasn't a lot people waiting but we waited maybe about 10 mins for our table. We were seated in the party room, the one with the karaoke stage lol. Our server is a middle-aged ahjumma and she was so friendly and cheery! Is she always like that?? Lol anyway, I ordered the Steven's donkatsu (7.99) and the pieces are long and did not come with the typical donkatsu sauce. It came with a side of wasabi mayo which was still good. I also shared an order of jajangmyun + tangsooyuk combo (15.99)  - yes I know I'm a piggy what?! My friends got pork bone soup, kimchi with pork stew, and jajangmyun and they all enjoyed it.   I also checked in for a free pop (even though I don't drink pop that often, but being Asian...I wanted to redeem a free drink lol). When we got our bill, I realized our server (the super cheery ahjumma) gave us the wrong bill. We quickly let another server know and the cheery lady came back and apologized and gave us our correct bill.   Lastly, I find songcook has really good customer service! It's quite rare to have good service in Asian restaurants such as this one. So props to the management team for training their staff well! It definitely made our dining experience a great one! Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of those Authentic restaurants for people who like getting culturally enriched. You can tell by the decor and the fact that we had to take off our shoes and sit on the floor.  Not sure what to order? Here are few plates that I can recommend:  1) Porkbone soup (D13) (Hint: WiFi): I strongly recommend it for groups. A huge bowl of soup with porkbones inside. Very delicious. Burner keeping it HOT.  2) Sweet & spicy chicken (L2): Large plate. Kinda like sweet & sour chicken from a chinese takeout. A crowd pleaser. You can't go wrong with that one.  3) Kalbi (S2): Short ribs. Medium sized plate. You can't go wrong with that one either. Really delicious.  4) Porkbelly BBQ (S10): My idea of a Korean BBQ. Cook me some BACON!  They got wine soju here! For some reason many Korean restaurant that I go to stopped serving it. Well these guys got it. If you have never had wine soju before then dude you're missing out!  High price, but they worth it. Wonderful service. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"When my friend and I first walked in, we were greeted promptly by a server and asked whether we wanted to sit at a table or on the floor. It took us a few seconds of being confused until we realized what she meant, but we then opted for floor seating.   They dont have a large variety of side dishes, but I was okay with that. I got kamjatang (as I always do) and my friend got the bibimbap. The bibimbap looked SO good - the veggies and meat looked really fresh and it was a big portion. My kamjatang was good - the broth wasn't as rich or spicy as I am used to but I loved how the dish was topped with Korean bean sprouts. One thing to note is that rice isn't included so you have to order that on the side.  The service was awesome - very polite and accommodating staff. Our server was patient with us when we asked a bajillion questions. My friend and I began experiencing some serious leg cramps 30 minutes into our meal. So the next time I come here, I wil defl opt for table seating instead."}
{"text":"For Korean restaurants, songcook has amazing service. But the food quality isn't very consistent. I always get the jajonmien but it would never taste as amazing as the first time I tried (maybe different chef?)  I don't like their little Korean dish. Not so creative.  And also its weird that their tofu soups don't come with rice. Honestly. They should just include the price of rice with the soup. Who doesn't eat rice with soup if you are Asian"}
{"text":"Ordered the combo for two (mackerel and soy bean soup) and rice cakes with ramen. The rice cakes were great - not too spicy and not too sweet. The combo was also good but soup was on salty side.   The service was very good and fast, one lady in particular was very enthusiastic and friendly. She kept refilling our tea immediately which was nice. Overall, it was a good meal and I would come back!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday lunch with my family. It was fine, if a little expensive by my downtown standards (heyyy Seor Ak San). Their old-fashioned jajangmyeon was rather bland, though the noodles themselves were pretty good. Udon was very average, though huge in portion. We also ordered the sweet&spicy chicken, which, while tasty, was nothing super spectacular. The seafood pancake was nice and thick, but again rather bland, though it was served with a soy sauce. I would have preferred the pancake itself to have more flavour without relying on the sauce. The japchae was served piping hot, which is something I am not accustomed to. I've always had japchae at room temperature or at least lukewarm.   Would probably not revisit, since there are better places on Yonge or downtown."}
{"text":"Good food, large and clean restaurant, fast and courteous service. Menu has lots of options with pictures. Restaurant is a bit hidden in back of plaza."}
{"text":"Visited on Good Friday after a friend requested a great Korean place.  Having visited a couple of times, I've always been impressed with their level of service and quality of authentic Korean foods.  They have two distinct methods of seating, traditionally on mats on raised hardwood floor, and contemporarily with tables and chairs.  Although I find sitting on the hardwood floors uncomfortable, its a unique experience for everyone to try.  I ordered soup with Haemul Soon Tofu, and it was delicious!  I recommended one of the JaJang combos for my friend, as I've had it in the past and have always enjoyed it.  The servers were quick and friendly, and even alerted me immediately when I incorrectly input my total amount in the tip amount - would probably have never known otherwise!  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"SongCooks is a staple Korean restaurant I frequented for several years. Food is good, price is right, and the manager is really nice. Once had an incident of a bug which was fully cooked anyway so harmless, the manager or owner personally came out apologizing non stop offering the dish free, which made me feel bad. :)  Dont just come here for the soon tofu or gamjatang... their other dishes are really good."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 20 people for lunch. I called ahead to reserve a table and they fit me in. That's a plus. However, that's the only good thing going for us.  We ordered our food. This part went well. However when the time for our food to arrive, this is when the chaos begins. They mixed up who the order is. Also, when I wanted to ask them what dish is which. They just gave a very rude response. Only thing I liked was the fact the food tasted okay and they fitted a group of 20 at a short notice. Will I come back? probably not."}
{"text":"I love the fact that they make home made noodles!  I had the seafood soup...was more japanese like to me..but still very good.  Another favourite is the spicy soup (don't remember name sorry) but apparently they order it here all the time. We also tried the seafood pancake (appetizer) it's $20!  to be shared.  it comes on a sizzling platter...yummy And also had the sweet and sour & spicy chicken (imperial dish) or something...it was basically a sweet and sour chicken with some sweet chili sauce (the one for chicken that is in the grocery stores) on it.  It was good but it was another $20 dish!   Prices aren't cheap unless you stick to the soup! But worth going back for the soup!"}
{"text":"The food was very delicious, I got the army based stew and finished it with my family. The only thing that concerned me was one of the waiters kept rushing us when we ordered."}
{"text":"Excellent service all around, friendly staff, great atmosphere. The LA kalbi beef was a little dry for us but that could be based on personal preferences (I like lots of charred fat on my meat!) Overall good experience."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant s 4 star because it well organized. It was busy but it was in order and service was quick and friendly. The food is a little above average for me. I would come again."}
{"text":"A spacious and tastefully decorated restaurant with pleasant and graceful staff serving a variety of authentic, \"Imperial\" style Korean fare, as well the traditional comfort food. There is even a shoeless, dining area where you can eat while sitting on heated, wooden floors. Service is swift. Portions are generous. Ingredients are fresh and the items are not overly salty. Prices are very reasonable. A real hidden gem in the Steeles & Yonge area."}
{"text":"My story for SongCook was during the Fall season in 2010 I actually walked by this place while they were moving and doing construction in this back corner of a plaza that leads to nowhere.  It lead to nowhere, that's why when those construction guys saw me walk pass them they looked at me funny.  Where the heck does this dude think he's going?  That time I notice their unfinished metallic front gates that speak of bling.  At that point, I wondered if this doubles as a Korean Strip Club when dining hours are complete.  The answer is a disappointing NO.   That's because I went back in early January for take-out and it's quite obvious there is some elegance to this place as you actually see a Host/Manager greeting you just past the entrance.  I thought I've arrived at Mandarin Buffet instead but he was such a friendly host as we actually took the Menu out to our car to browse.  My Friend notes that this seems to be more of a Korean-Chinese restaurant.  15 minutes after our order we went back inside to this sizable restaurant that seems quite open-spaced and somewhat suitable for large groups and even banquet gatherings.  If I remember correctly, I was watching their Television while my Friend was paying the bill.  That could have been another place though.    This place is possibly Date Friendly environment, I'll have to try them again dining-in to confirm.  What's better than stuffing yourself in front of your date with huge portions of Korean food and slurping dark sauced noodle all over them?  #44 Sam Sun Gan Ja Jang(Seafood & Pork JaJang Noodle $10.00)  -  As stated by others, the Noodle was nice with some bite.  The seafood was the small bitesize variety inside the Ja Jang which had noticeable amount of chopped Onion.  For the price paid, it was reasonable with the portion size but maybe it was meant to be shared as even half size is enough for some."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the worst Korean restaurants in the area. What kind of place charges 11$ for a soon tofu and charges extra for rice? I myself ordered the spicy kasu for 14$ + tax. It was one of the most disgusting things I have ever tasted. It had a burnt taste, which I quickly pointed out to the waitress. So she brought me a new one, which still had the burnt taste. Later when I went to pay, the owner of the place came and explained that it is supposed to taste like that. Oh great. so it's supposed to taste nasty eh?  Also it's the only Korean restaurant in the area that gives a measly 3 side dishes.  Extremely overpriced and the cook has absolutely no sense of taste."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my boyfriend and his relatives. Compared to a lot of Korean restaurants, this one is a fairly big location and the seating I find is nice and spacious. I would say this a good place to bring family and if you have young children it is also good as you have enough space to put the stroller. Their menu is also fairly large so you have a good choice selection. I also think the prices on their menu is fair too. We ordered a lot of food for the dinner and I think one of my favorite dishes was the ginseng chicken soup. I have had this dish at other Korean restaurants but I think this place does it best by so far. They give you a whole mini chicken in this dish at this restaurant. The other dish that I really enjoyed was the beef short ribs. It was cooked just right. I think this place is a great place for family dinners."}
{"text":"I have tried many Korean restaurants  and none of them bits this one . Not only the food is amazing, the service is excellent and the interior design is very cozy and traditional ."}
{"text":"This definitely is the place to go when you want a variety of Korean foods and don't have anything specific in mind.  The options are a plenty and the value is awesome.  I have never been disappointed in any of my visits to this restaurant.    We usually get the jajangmyun and kampoonggi combo which allows you to get a taste of two traditional Korean/Chinese dishes.  There jajangmyun is good and the noodles have just the right amount of bounce to give your taste buds a great experience.  The Kampoonggi is nice and crispy and there sauce is bit on the sweeter side compared to other places.  By far the best experience I had with them was when I had my daughter's first birthday party there.  Dale worked with me to make sure I had what I needed for my set menu and made sure that all my guests had their needs met.  He did a set menu that was perfect for our group and even catered the event himself along with another staff.  The effort that he put in just showed his dedication to the restaurant.  The food was phenomenal as we had several traditional Korean dishes and he even gave my daughter a gift card so we could return on another date.  As I said they went above and beyond absolutely love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"The perfect place after a 2.5 hour power hike out in Pickering.  We were a group of 5 and were hungry so we ordered quite a lot but every dish that arrived quickly and with care.  Our server was friendly and even provided a little history lesson about the origins of the JTF Army Stew!  The KalBiJim (marinated beef ribs) just fell off the bone and were fantastic. Seafood pancake was humungous and had generous portions of seafood sprinkled throughout!  The JTF Army Stew is an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink type of dish that included loads of veggies, kimchi, ramen, sausage, and cheese on top.  Really filling and should be shared by at least two hungry folks.  I ordered a kamjatang on the side (because I was craving it) and paired really well with the brown and barley rice.  I want to come back another time to try the SamGehTang as I have not seen this offered anywhere else in Toronto so far."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Korean joints in the GTA with the most authentic Korean dishes and the warmest service I've experienced in a while. Their venue is split into two sections, one side with traditional seating on floor cushions eating off low tables, and the other side with regular seated tables. Song Cook's is one of the few Korean restaurants in Toronto that provide the traditional seating, allowing customers to experience the full Korean style of dining. Aside from the superb atmosphere, the food is authentic, well-portioned, and reasonably priced (with the exception of some dishes being a little pricey, but nothing outrageous).   We had the Nuroongji tang (), a rice crisp soup, and a Ganja jang (), a noodle dish with black bean sauce, to share amongst two people. The Nuroongji tang was so delicious and unique. The waiter put the Nuroongji (rice crisps) in the soup when he came to our table to ensure the rice stays crisp. The soup was rich and savoury with a hint of sweetness; I would highly, highly recommend this dish. I haven't had a dish like this anywhere else in the GTA, so bonus points for being unique.  The Ganja jang was also good. The noodles were chewy and the sauce was very flavourful. I do think the Nuroongji tang outshone the ganja jang though; the black bean sauce of the noodles had great flavour, but it was slightly oily and contained too many onions (definitely not the dish for someone who doesn't like onions). However, it was still really enjoyable and delicious.   There are so many options to choose from on their menu, with a good handful of dishes marked with a green leaf to signify that they can be made vegan. Our waiter was so sweet, always checking to make sure we were served well. He assured us that the side dishes were all vegan friendly before he brought them to the table and was very helpful when ordering our food. He asked us a few times throughout the meal how things tasted and if everything was going alright which was so nice! The waiter also made an effort to have a genuine conversation with us when we were paying our bill! I feel as if such great service is a rarity nowadays..   It's also good to know that they have an app where you can collect points and redeem free food once you've reached 10 points with one visit being worth 1 point! The app also had coupons and updates for the restaurant.   There is so much more of the menu I want to explore and I can't wait to go back! Can't recommend this place enough! Y'all gotta go to Song Cook's."}
{"text":"This is a really good place for Korean food. They are open to a decent hour, and they have a lot of seating.   Price is comparable to the other Korean places in the area - it's fair. Portions are ok.  My main gripe is just from what I've seen in terms of hygiene and cleanliness.   The men's bathroom is not in the best shape. It looks/feels like it's cleaned every couple days. One time I was there, there was just an empty large garbage can, with no bag, lid on the ground, and a little garbage can in the middle of the bathroom with a shopping bag in it. It looked like someone finished emptying the garbage and forgot to finish the rest of the task.   I've also seen the employees gathering trash near the end of the day and piling it up near the rice cookers/kitchen area. As a customer, I don't really want to see a pile of trash near the seating area/my food! Put it in the back!   I'm sure they just want everything tidied up and emptied for when they close, but still. That's kind of nasty. That's not how you want customers to see your restaurant.   Overall, this is a good go-to place for Korean food in the area. The food is pretty good - I'm sure there is better options, but this place is convenient. They just need to work on cleaning up some hygiene practices. From what I've seen, it makes me question their hygiene practices."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time yesterday. The decor is nice and there's free parking which is a plus. The food was just average and in my opinion very over priced. I had the ssam pork belly vegetable wraps but the rice was an additional cost as well the vegetables. I paid $6 for 2 things of lettuce when this usually comes included with the meal for a much better price. The banchan didn't have a lot of variety, only 3 dishes. The food wasn't great enough for me to justify the prices, I'd rather stay more south of Yonge. Only other star is that the service is great and fast and food comes out quickly."}
{"text":"This place is really a hidden gem.  It looks small On the outside, however the inside is huge, clean and feels authentic.   The service is over the top, and the food is excellent.    We had the spicy squid (recommended)  pork bone soup (so much meat!)  and some sweet and spicy chicken with barley and brown rice.   Overall an excellent experience and I woke up thinking about it.  Will be back."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious. Make sure to try the braised short ribs (KalBiJjim) and the pork bone soup (KamJaTang). Though everything I've tried so far has been good.  The restaurant is nicely decorated, service is good, and the food is excellent. It's one of my go-to Korean restaurants.  If you're planning on going for dinner, you might also want to consider making a reservation, as (based on my experience, at least) the restaurant gets pretty full from 6-8pm.  Also, for any other white diners out there, make sure you flag down your server if you need anything (i.e. water, tea, banchan, etc.). This might seem obvious to some, but a simple cultural misunderstanding in service expectations seems to be the cause of a lot of negative reviews."}
{"text":"Went with coworkers after work. It was fully packed. The food is really good with nice portion."}
{"text":"Ever since my first visit, I have fallen in love with this place. I literally crave food from here...I pretty much always get the same dishes too. Black bean noodles and their fried dumplings. That's it. *drops mic* I have tried some of their other dishes and they're also very good but those 2 are my favourite. Prices are reasonable here and the service is very good. I have sat in the traditional side and the regular tables and chair side, definitely nice to try out new things. I won't hesitate to jump at the chance to sit either side if it means I get to eat sooner! Love this place. It is a bit of a trek but it's totally worth the distance."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends for some Korean food. The best dish is hands down is the fall off the bone braised beef ribs. You can order a small or large size depending on the number of people who want to share. The meat is so tender and it comes with some veggies plus a nice stew sauce that any carbs can soak it up.  We had ordered the fried chicken but we were surprised that it was not the same as the Korean fried chicken at other places. It was a different batter and no bones. I did not completely enjoy the dish as I was expecting something else. Will be back if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"The place is really hard to find, I got there because one of my friend recommended it to me, and he explained really well how to get there otherwise I'd have ended up eating some burgers...  The down side is that they need a Big sign out on the street.. is impossible to see that the restaurant is inside that plaza, to be specific, BEHIND GALLERIA Supermarket.  the Food amazingly delicious, obviously the owner is korean.  The Menu is not that extensive as other restaurants, which is good in my point of view, but they have all the best things.  One thing, because nothings is perfect, I went there with 1 friend and we ordered 3 dishes, 2 big ones and one starter.. the thing is that everything came at the same time.. we couldn't enjoy the starter and went directly to the big ones.. that is something that the restaurant needs to understand.. there are steps to eat when X amount food is ordered.   Overall, we eat because of taste and presentation (how clean and how well you will be attended, must be good by default), and everything was really good in terms of food.  Try the Pork ribs special!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very busy Korean place that offers lots of choices.   Service is excellent.  Must try the black bean noodles and my favourite sweet and sour chicken.   The fried dumplings are also quite good.  One other option is the seafood pancake, but you need to have others to share with.  The side dishes portions are not as generous as some of the other Korean places.   They offer floor and table seating options.  It's a decent place for Korean with parking too!"}
{"text":"My first time at Song Cook recommended by a co worker. I love the restaurant because it is spacious. One side is tatami and the other sit dining. Staff were very friendly especially Jenny. I ordered the pork bone soup. It looked a bit different from the other gamjatang that I had at other restaurants. Soup was more dark brown colour. A little bit salty, but still good. The soup did not come with the rice so I added $3.50 for a bowl of brown rice. They had 4 different rice to choose from. Side dishes were included. Overall great place and will definitely return to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant. If you are looking for a bit more nicer than small/dark korean restaurant in town; you must go here. I've been here a couple of times before and this was the first time where we tried the traditional floor table set up.  It was an overall enjoyable experience and it is highly recommended.  Food: 4/5, just delicious. We all got different dishes but also got samgyupsal (korean table top BBQ) and ddeokbokgi (spicy rice cake with onions, fish cake, dumplings, ramen noodles etc). I myself got the happy set which consisted of spicy seafood noodle soup, jjajjangmyun (black bean noodles), kkanpunggi (spicy deep fried pork), and fried rice.  Ok a lot of between the four of us and we all very much enjoyed it.  Service: 4/5, excellent, the table top cooking was all done by our waitress which was a nice surprise as you usually have to cook and do everything on your own. She was also very friendly as well as the other workers here.  Ambience: 4/5, great decor - a bit of mixed traditional seating on one side with wooden tables and cushion you can sit on the floor and regular tables on the other side.  It's very spacious and perfect for conversations.  Price: 4/5, it was about $110 with tip and everything; that is one affordable meal for four people with a lot of dishes and we ordered a whole lot."}
{"text":"We had the dotsbibimap $8 and the Kolbi beef $14  They did a great job serve hot and quicker than a McDonalds drive through  Extensive menu to satisfy the fickle  Bonus points for bottomless tea and side dish refills  If you love Korean then this is a great place  Parking can be very tight here"}
{"text":"Thank God for yelp because there's no way you can find this place without a map and even then it's at the plaza. So I found this place and when I got in I noticed almost all patrons are Korean which immediately put me at ease. I ordered bibimbap and it was OK, not bad but not great either. I had bibimbap many times before and I wasn't disappointed but this one didn't shine really. What shined for me was the side dishes, they were great and the service was great too. One other thing was the special yelp check in, a free pop. All in all I would definitely come back here to try the other dishes on the menu, they look authentic and looks like Korean people like them too..."}
{"text":"Love! 4.5 stars. I've been meaning to come here for a hella long time because it's one of the better Korean restaurants, as reported by my Korean friends. I read the other reviews that it's hard to find but I had no trouble- my iphone map told me it's RIGHT beside the moores on yonge and steeles and I just followed that (and my heart) all the way to song cook.   I was very impressed upon walking in, as I am not used to Korean restaurants that are THIS huge. They have one side with tables and the other side with traditional floor seating, which I am SO down to try in the winter (apparently it's heated! Imagine a warm tushy and a warm stomach from the delicious piping hot spicy soups. Gaaaah) The menu is one of the most extensive I've ever seen, going from page to page to page. I heard the dolsot bibambap is bomb, so I ordered that while my boyfriend ordered the gamjatang. The gamjatang doesn't come with rice like most Korean places offer, so he had to get a side of white rice which was $2. It was in the extra orders page, where they offer white rice, brown rice and even lettuce wraps in case you wanted to wrap your meal. When the food came, I was very impressed by the portions and the bibambap was AMAZING. Honestly, if you're thinking about getting it, get the dolsot NOT the regular. The crispy rice makes that much of a difference. My boyfriend's gamjatang was amazing and it tasted very fresh and clean. The flavour was strong and it was like nothing I've tasted before. Song cook doesn't use MSG and I love that.   The sidedishes were large and they gave us a lot of kimchi, which you have to cut yourself (but I didn't bother... the more the better). Service was also prompt and friendly. The check in offer for a free pop kept the boyfriend happy, so no complaining there. I'd definitely come back to try the samgyupsal, galbi, jajangmyun and the naeng myun. Can I order ALL of these and just eat it now, please?"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now. My family and I love the atmosphere and we enjoy the fact that there's an option to sit on heated floors and mats to eat. The first time we went, about 4 years ago, we were blown away by the quality of the food and service. Last time we were here, I noticed that the quality of the service hadn't changed but the quality of the food has. (I'm hoping it's just a one-day thing and that the quality isn't like this in the future.)  DdukBokki (spicy stir-fried rice cakes, with oden, vegs, egg = $7.99 + chewy noodles for an extra $3.00). They were harder than they should have been but the flavour was really good. The extra $3.00 for the chewy noodles wasn't really worth it - especially because we ordered a lot anyway.  Beef teriyaki with vegs,rice, and miso ($15.99) was a good choice - you can't really do teriyaki wrong.   Bokeumbap ($9.99) - stir-fried rice with vegs, eggs, surimi, & jajang sauce (black bean base) was super filling but salty. Same goes with their JangBan JaJang: stir-fried eggs, seafood, ground beef, black bean sauce on noodles with a bit of chili oil ($11.99 for one; $19.99 for two). If they cut down on the salt, this would be a favourite for sure.  Dolsot BiBimBap - sauteed vegs, ground beef, egg on rice in a stone bowl ($10.99) was hot, fresh, & tasty - definitely a fave.   Overall, SongCook's is a nice, cozy, & warm place to grab good Korean food. Is it the best in the area? Maybe not but it's definitely worth popping into to satisfy any craving."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place in Toronto for authentic Korean food. I'm always contemplating my next visit here! Dudbuki is a must. The serving is huge here and restaurant is not a cheapskate on good ingredients, like when you order fish hot pot or sea food noodles, you really get tons of fillet and mussels. The price is very descent for the portion like around $10 for a classical dish. Jian Jian mien here is my favourite. The rice with barley and beans is also very delicious. The tradition seats are heated during winter, which makes the experience very pleasant. Overall, this place is full of compliments. Really looking forward for the next visit."}
{"text":"SongCook's is a great, authentic korean restaurant that you will certainly enjoy. Although I had a good and tasty experience here, I wasn't blown away by anything and there are some little things that detract from this place. That being said, I still consider Songcook's to be one of the top Korean restaurants in Toronto.  Half the restaurant is split into on the floor seating and table seating and personally that is an idea that I really welcome, despite having dead feet. For those of us tall people, it will be a bit of a struggle but it's rather nice you can enjoy a meal in a traditional manner!   Side dishes were rather lacking as you will only get three: kimchi, bean sprouts, and radish. However, you're free to ask for as much as you would like and I have to say their kimchi is amongst my favourite kimchi I have ever had. It tasted fresh and I really enjoyed how crunchy and sweet it was.   For the food, I have to say the samgyeopsal ssam wraps were my favourite dish of the evening. They were tender, grilled well, and weren't too fatty. Their vegetable wrap tray comes with romaine lettuce, kale, and perillia leaves and I found that one order is more than enough. The jokbal was really interesting - it was five spiced sliced pork hock. The pork was tender and flavourful and there was quite a lot of meat on the plate. It was served with various sauces - a fish (anchovy based?), a salt based, soy bean based, and a mustard one. I loved the variation and enjoyed the mustard one the most. I do recommend eating the jokbal as a ssam for maximum enjoyment! The hwedeopbap, while good, was fairly standard and the same with the gamjatang.   One minor complaint with this is that rice is separate. The soups didn't come with rice, and neither does the BBQ. It's kind of silly because how else will you eat it? I understand they do have brown rice, and barley rice but they really should include white rice. Instead, you pay $2 for a bowl of white rice and $3.50 for the others. Which leads me to say that the overall prices here are a tad on the higher side, but that's okay, because the food here is great.   Service is great despite it being very busy. The dishes came out fairly quickly and although we had to remind the lady for the jokbal, she served it right after. Bonus points for her explaining what some items were and teaching us how to eat some of the dishes i.e. what goes along with what.   All in all, I would definitely return here to SongCook's for their great authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, good atmosphere.  It's an all-around good restaurant.  We ordered: ============ 1) jajangmyeon - The noodles are good.  Chewy in the good way. - The sauce is not overly sweet like a lot of places, but still flavourful. 2) Spicy Rice Cakes - These were really good.  But so filling. - Again the seasoning on this dish was much better than a lot other restaurants that either make it too sweet or too spicy. - Rice cakes were cooked just right, nice and chewy too! 3) Grilled pork belly - These came on a hot plate. - These were good but I think I want to try the ribs next time I am here. - The only thing about the hot plate is that the meat gets tougher and more overlooked as you eat.  By the time we had our last few pieces it was over cooked and tough.   Would we come back? ================== Definitely!  The menu had a lot of good looking food and we only tried 3 dishes."}
{"text":"Good food, portions are big but considering the more expensive prices then the bigger size is good."}
{"text":"I don't live close to this central part of the city but I did quite enjoy the experience at this restaurant. We were a larger party of five adults and two toddlers so our table was just packed with what we ordered. When the food came, we were just like wow with their presentation and boy was the taste there! The service was great with the servers explaining what this dish was and what this sauce was for. The interior decor was so-so but you're there for the food. I'd say it's quite worth the experience to try this place out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"The gamtajang is not bad here in terms of size and flavour, but the meat was not as fall off the bone as I like. The spicy rice cake is on the mild side (more of a soy base) and probably will not order again."}
{"text":"Probably the best all-around Korean restaurant in Greater Toronto Area without a doubt.   Food-wise, SongCook's dishes are as close to authentic & delicious home-style Korean cooking you can get. Classic dishes such as JangJamyun (black bean noodle), kkanpunggi (deep fried pork sweet sour) or simple dishes such as bim bim bap are prepared executed flawlessly. If I have to nitpick the food - only their soon tofu last time I tried was not up to par (a little too salty)  Service-wise, I have not encountered any Korean restaurant to have better service than SongCook's (this includes pricier Korean restaurant such as Sariwon). Service is of the highest level of being gracious while at the same time efficient and attentive.  At this point - I should concede and give up already finding a better Korean restaurant than SongCook's. Can't recommend enough of this restaurant to any friends and family who are looking for a solid Korean food pick."}
{"text":"Pretty good Korean restaurant for authentic Korean food. It is a little more expensive than others but in exchange, you do get the real deal. There's an option to sit on the floor if you really like to be traditional. I ordered the sashimi salad and kalbi soup. It's good to note that you have to pay extra for rice. They give you an option between barley and brown.   Service was great and food came relatively fast. You don't get too many side dishes though. I think we only got kimchi and one other dish, which makes me abit sad. But, I would come again if I happen to pass by."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant; it is my go-to place for whenever I am craving Korean food!! It's super authentic, service is extremely friendly, and food always tastes fantastic!!   I ordered the seafood jajangmyun and from that first bite... I was in bliss, cloud nine, paradise!! The jajang flavour was just right and not too salty. Also, the noodles were made fresh in the restaurant and it had the perfect balance of chewy and soft. Quite frankly, I think I ordered this dish solely because of its awesome noodle; I will note that they also use this noodle in their champong (seafood noodle soup) dish, which is my other go-to order at this restaurant. In addition, the portion of my order was so huge that I had to pack home a good half of it, which wasn't a bad thing, because I got to enjoy it again the next day!! Yay!!  As usual, the side dishes are amazing!! I love how the side dishes offer a variety of flavours--sweet, salty, spicy, and pickled--that complements well with your main dish.  Service is always wonderful; I love how the servers are kind and responsive to whatever you need. My only criticism is that I wished my tea cup was filled more frequently but other than that, I had an enjoyable experience.   Would I return? Most definitely YESS!!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the more popular Korean restaurants in the city.  Came here after work with some friends. Finding this place can be tricky as its behind the Moores plaza at Yonge and Steeles.  Upon entering the venue is huge with plenty of seating as well as features heated floors for those who prefer to traditionally sit on them while enjoying their meal.   In terms of service, it was fast, friendly and efficient.  Their menu is extensive and reservation is highly recommended especially on weekends.  Their prices are reasonable, for our entourage we decided to order their platter for 3, which we could barely finish.  Platter for 3: Korean noodles with vegetables, Fried Pork, and rice. To complement the food we order two types of Soju, one flavored and the other plain. Overall experience was great and their prices are reasonable.   Kudos to Songs Cook!"}
{"text":"Food was not bad but service was terrible. Had to ask the hostess where our waiter was.  Then after taking our order he never came back.  Had to ask a different waitress if they wanted our money to get the bill."}
{"text":"My first experience at Songcook's was quite a forgettable one as evident by my previous review 3 years ago.  However, since then, I've returned more than a dozen times in smaller groups and have thoroughly enjoyed it for what I like to think is the best Korean comfort food restaurant in all of Toronto!  Service is flaky at times as they do not have the call buttons like most Korean restaurants do so it does take awhile to flag someone down.  The food though is amazing! My favourites are the LA Kalbi, for $20 you get 3 large short ribs of perfectly grilled beef ribs seasoned amazingly well!  Definitely a must have whenever I visit. Next is the beef bulgogi, again, superbly done well here. Whatever sauce they use in the Kalbi, they use it here too and it's just delicious to taste.  Reminds me of the feeling you get when you bite into a hot off the grill fresh meat burger.  The old school jaja myung with its black bean sauce in noodles, topped with chunks of beef, cabbage, onions and potatoes - you cannot get more comforting Korean food than this.    Other notables are the pan fried dumplings, fresh and juicy pork belly done at your table.  Ban chan portions are generous and compliments your meals perfectly.   And always, always check-in with the YELP app for a free soft drink.  Songcook definitely elevates traditional Korean fare to a whole other level that is unmatched anywhere in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Korean comfort food! Portions were very generous. We ordered the gamjatang pork bone soup, jjajangmyeon black bean noodles, and ddukbokki rice cakes with instant noodles. The pork bone soup was very hearty. Broth had a meaty aroma as well with 4 big pieces of meat/bone. Rice was an extra $3.50 (4 types to choose from). The rice cakes were sweet and chewy, and not spicy so I could eat it quickly. Instant noodles was an extra $1. Black bean noodles were good and not salty like the other places I've tried. We split the bill by 3 so with tax it was only $11.30+tip each!  P.S. the heated floors were a bonus during the freezing temperatures   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I came by with a friend for dinner on a weekday around 6ish and since the restaurant wasn't very busy, we were seated pretty quickly. They offered a huge selection of dishes on the menu so it took us awhile to make up our minds. At the end, we decided to get JaJangMyun, rice cakes and bibimbap to share.   My friend liked everything but wasn't so crazy about the JaJangMyun, which was a noodie dish covered in black bean sauce along with diced meat and topped off with some cucumbers. I found the dish very savory and liked the fact the noodles were cooked to a chewy texture. I thought the rice cakes were a tad too spicy for my liking and was drowning myself in water the entire time to put out the spiciness in my mouth.       A fun fact about Song Cook's - one section of the restaurant was arranged in the Korean traditional seating. You can actually dine in that area with a few friends by sitting on the mats with heated flooring. You would probably need a good stretch afterwards - having sat on your legs or kept them crossed during the entire meal!"}
{"text":"I have to say this is one of the best Korean restaurants I have ever been to. Staff are quite pleasant, and general ambience is welcoming. We decided to try a few items that stood out to us that are considered Korean food staples. We were not disappointed, my friends and I thoroughly enjoyed the wine soju which was quite unique and incredibly delicious. I've been here twice and both times the food quality was exceptional, the flavors well balanced and the portion size were quite large for our group. In all it was a pleasant experience and we would not hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Great place!  I was happy to learn from Dale (if I'm not mistaken) that the beef is organic! Not only that they also have handmade noodles as well as option to swap your ordinary plain white rice for a wholesome option with barley.  I ordered their Kalbi Tang (beef ribs soup + rice) and hand made noodles with shrimp and pork... It was really good, except there was a MSG after taste... or maybe it was too salty... otherwise, it's really good.  I would give it a 3.5 right now... If there was no MSG, I'd give it a 4 star."}
{"text":"I came here based on the high reviews on Yelp. The service was slow for a weekday evening even though there weren't many customers in he restaurant. My friend and I were waiting at the entrance for a few minutes before a server came to take us to a table.   I ordered the dolsot bibimbap. This was just like any other dolsot bibimbap I would get in other locations. It was hot and loaded with vegetables as usual.   My friend ordered a gamjatang. But it is an additional cost to order rice.   Overall, I thought the food was alright. But the prices are a bit higher. I probably won't return again for bibimbap and gamjatang since I didn't think the higher price was worth it here. But maybe next time I will try samgyeopsal."}
{"text":"My favourite Korean restaurant to go to. They have a large variety on the menu and the food is delicious. The decor and ambiance is great.  Perfect for dates. We have tried their pork bone soup,  black bean noodles,  grilled mackerel. Their food is great and it has a more upscale feel then tour traditional Korean restaurants at Christie. Very clean and great service. I have become a regular here. They even have a loyalty app. They also have the Bell service. So you can ring and a server will come running. I really missed this when I left Korea.  My top choice for Korean food and I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place me and my friend go here all the time. I am a repeat customer here and one of the owners is so nice to us and honours that. They have refills on side dishes and I am in love with their kam ja tung soup."}
{"text":"I was recommended by a friend to come and try Korean food at this restaurant. The restaurant is pretty big and it had seating on the floor or tables you can sit at. They sell a lot of the staple Korean food like samgyeopsal, gamjatang, bibimbap, japchae etc... The food was pretty good, the portions were nice. The servers were pretty nice and they gave you more side dishes if you asked.  I come here for dinner a lot, and I have tried sitting on the floor which is heated but once your done eating. It feels shaky to get up because your so full. It's also because I'm not use to it but it was an interesting experience.  We were able to bring our leftovers home, which was nice."}
{"text":"Loved sitting at the traditional seats with the heated floor.   Really wanted to like this restaurant but in the end I wasn't a fan.   Management loudly announcing to their servers what they should be doing, average food (for the price point).   I'd suggest it to others to try it out, but wouldn't come back here myself"}
{"text":"Food here is hit and miss. I've had more misses here than hits unfortunately so I won't be so adventurous next time I visit this place.  Menu: http://www.songcooks.com/menu.html Also one annoying thing I found about their menu is that they include pictures, but no labels so you don't know which item corresponds to which picture!  What we had: A whole lot of items over multiple visits, let me see... Special jajang noodles (the one with a bunch of vegetables and seafood mixed in), seafood pancake, ddukbokki (spicy rice cake), spicy pork, bulgogi, sengtaetang (spicy fish soup), soondobu (soft tofu) soup, cham pong (spicy seafood noodle soup), pork & kimchi soup, kamjatang (pork bone soup), a salmon sashimi salad (forget what it's called on the menu), boiled dumplings, sweet and sour pork (chicken? couldn't tell), stewed beef short ribs with carrot & radish, and more I can't remember...  Taste: 7/10  As I mentioned, food here is hit and miss. The solid ones that we keep coming back for are the jajang noodles and the spicy pork. Their noodles are a good level of chewy and very flavourful. The pork is well seasoned and yummy as well. The beef short ribs are also good, and Steven's friends always come back for that dish. Their soups are generally good, oddly except for their kamjatang, which was lacking in flavour. They did give a lot of pork bones in that soup though.   The remaining dishes were not so notable. Their bulgogi was very dry and bland, that one was disappointing. I'm a big fan of ddukbokki and theirs didn't have enough kick. The cham pong had so much undercooked onion in it, I spent most of my time picking out the undercooked onion from the soup. When I was done picking out the undercooked onion, it filled up a good half of a bowl.  Their side dishes were lacklustre. It's a small selection of different types of kimchi, so I thought maybe they offer quality over quantity--nope, the cabbage kimchi was barely fermented.  Value: 5/10  Portions are generally more than enough to fill you up, although one thing I don't get is that they charge extra for rice. Really?? This is the only Korean restaurant I've been to that charges extra for rice on their soups, when their soup prices are already on par with other Korean restaurants.  $12-15 for most single serving plated dishes (spicy pork, bulgogi, etc), $10-13 for single-serving soup, $15-25 for single serving main dishes (stew short-ribs, fried chicken etc.), $30-50 for double serving main dishes (these are more worthwhile, there is usually more than twice the amount compared to the single serving). Pre-set group combos cost anywhere between $20-25 per person  ** Average cost per diner: $20-25 after tax and tip  Service/Convenience: 9/10   Service is generally prompt and the food came pretty quickly. The servers don't keep napkins around so when we asked for extra napkins, they just took it from an empty table lol. The location is a little hidden away in the plaza and may not be so easy to locate for the first time.  Would go back? Occasionally, if we're craving some spicy pork or their special jajang noodles.  Would recommend to friend? Sure if they already like Korean food.  Similar places: So many Korean places around that area  **Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza"}
{"text":"This is the place to go when it's freezing outside! They have a tatami with a heated floor which is sooo warm and comfy, especially on a cold winter day. My friend had to shift multiple times because of this, so stretch beforehand because you'll be having your meal on hardwood floor haha! They also have regular tables.. but that's not as special... :P  I didn't like their kimchi side dishes but I loved the jajangmyun that I ordered! It was the jajangmyun + seafood soup combo. I'll definitely order this again :D The jajangmyun noodles were very chewy and flavorful because of the black bean sauce :)"}
{"text":"Ambience: 4/5 Cost: 3/5 Food: 4/5 Service; 3/5  I had heard good, authentic Korean food being served here at SongCook's and came here tonight to give it a try for dinner.  We had to wait a little bit for a table (not too long, 5-10 minutes); it was probably around 7pm on a Sunday and we didn't have reservations. It was actually packed, which I was quite shocked to see considering the time of day.  The restaurant seating is interesting as you get to pick between sitting in the area with tables and chairs, or the other more \"home-y\" side where you have to take off your shoes and seat cross-legged at a short table (I wonder if the idea came from how Koreans traditionally ate?). We didn't realize until we said \"it doesn't matter, just as long as we get a seat\" that they then brought us over to the other seated situation. There was a large screen TV playing the Olympics, so I actually felt like I was at someone's house being served Korean food!  The menu is quite large with an assortment of rice (white, brown, brown and barley, etc), but we ended up getting a dolsot bibimbap, gamjatang, and another soup-based dish that was in a photo labelled \"Pork Delicacies!\". This was eaten with our complimentary appies of kimchi, brined vegetables, and beansprouts.  The food was relatively good, I enjoyed my dolsot bibimbap in its hot stone pot and the two soup-based dishes tasted good as well; a little on the bland side, which I don't mind at all (I think that means less MSG :D). Generally speaking, I think they have better food than some of the other chains I've visited (Nak Won, Owl) though I think those had better banchan.  The service was a little bit lacking; it took a while for someone to come and take down our drinks, took someone even longer to place our order, and several of our requests after that were usually forgotten (i.e. water jug, more napkins, more tea) and we'd have to ask multiple people, multiple times.  Tip: if you are self-conscious about exposing your (smelly :P) feet nor enjoy sitting cross-legged, opt for the table/left side of the restaurant! The tables here usually fill up faster though."}
{"text":"I've been to many Korean restaurants (too many to count) so I was excited to try another korean restaurant. It's a fairly large place with two sections. You can either choose to sit on warm mats or normal chairs. We chose to just sit on chairs..apparently the mats get too warm. The restaurant has a nice cozy atmosphere with a cottage like vibe. We ordered two veggie platters ($9) which is two plates of lettuce, kale and this other type of leafy green. They also give you two sauces on the side (one sesame based and the other bean based). We also ordered beef ribs and pork belly to eat with the veggies. Personally I've rarely been to korean restaurants that had veggie plates so i was quite excited to finally try it. The concept is simple...you just wrap whatever you like with the veggies to make a lettuce wrap. It's a very classic korean dish that I've only witnessed on TV haha. It's a fun and hands on way to eat and an alternative to the usual rice. You can also ask for garlic slices and spicy green peppers to add to your veggie wraps. The ribs were nicely marinated but wasn't a huge fan of the pork belly (prefer it to be more tender). We also ordered the seafood noodle and the Sachun Jakang (spicy noodles with seafood and beef). The seafood noodles were average and the spicy noodles reminded me of Italian pasta since it was tomato based to my surprise. Next time I would probably order the spicy chewy noodles since I prefer the korean red hot pepper type of spicy. I would definitely come back again to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's bday. Quite a spacious restuarant. We were seated in the regular tables. (When I left I noticed the other side of the restaurant has traditional Korean tables.) It was a bit awkward to have mirrors right above your dinning table. Good thing I wasn't wearing anything low cut ;P  We were a party of 7 so we ordered a whole bunch of food. Seafood Pancake, Grilled Pork Belly, Grilled Beef Kalbi, JaJangMyeon, Bibimbap, Shrimp Fried Rice, Spring Rolls, Dumplings, & Spicy Tonkatsu.  Seafood Pancake was huge like a size of a large pizza. It was quite tasty and there was little fleck of seafood in it.   Spring roll & Dumplings were ok. But nothing spectacular.   Spicy Tonkatsu was bland and wasn't spicy at all for me that is. And it was weird to have the crispy tonkatsu drenched in the sauce. It totally sogged it up.   Grilled Pork Belly& Kalbi was so good! I liked the charred grilled taste. And the sauces that went with them were delis.   Shrimp Fried Rice was ok but I thought there was way too much shredded radish n cabbagek on top.   JajangMyoen was soso. I thought it was a bit bland for my taste.  Bibibamp was ok too. But nothing special as well.   I would come back for try their others items :)"}
{"text":"Awesome place! I'm not Asian, so I appreciate the easy to read menu.  Service is very good, helpful and friendly.  Portions are healthy and ingredients are good quality.  The kamjatang may not include rice side - but it's quite filling.  The soup base is delicious.  The Samsun gajajang had a lot of onion (which I love)  but not a lot of shrimp or pork.   Otherwise a great meal! Will be back and will recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Would eat here if I was near by and nothing else I'm craving for but it's not worth driving all the way there."}
{"text":"We ended up trying this place due to positive reviews and it's slightly closer than our normal Korean favs.  On first impression the place seemed nice.  You are greeted politely at the door and the restaurant is nicely decorated.  From when we sat down it started going downhill.  To start we were only offered three side dishes when you are normally provided with five or six.  Even the kimchi wasn't very good, the sauce was too watery.  We ordered the KamJaTang and KamPoonGi and rice was not included.  Usually rice is provided with KamJaTang.  We did check in for a free drink.  That was a nice promotion but the prices here are higher anyway.  Our food was decent but not great.  It's not to the point where I would complain about the food, but I could list a handful of places that make it better so I don't think we will be return customers.  If service and cleanliness is a big thing for you, you may like this restaurant.  But for me the most important factor is how good the food is, and SongCook is nothing special."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's always busy and service and noms are very good. Mmmmmm, tuna kimchi tofu stew . My go-to resto when I'm craving something yummy."}
{"text":"We went for the first time today after hearing great things - and they were right. This place is awesome - the food, décor and service are incredible. We had the combo jajang (black bean noodles) and khanpoungi (sweet and spicy chicken), and an order of ddeokbokki (spicy rice cakes) - everything was delicious, some of the best we've ever had. The noodles were cooked perfectly, and the black bean sauce was to die for. The chicken was crispy, the sauce sweet and spicy. The ddeok was soft but not falling apart. The kimchi and banchan were all great! We also got to sit on a nicely warmed floor, which was fun and something a little different - though you can choose a table and chairs as well if you'd prefer. The biggest thing was the effort the (I'm assuming) owner made to greet every table in our area and spend a little time time welcoming us. He was so warm and friendly, and that extra effort and personal touch really stands out in Toronto. We will definitely be back - we've found a new favourite!"}
{"text":"I love good Korean food, not Korean BBQs, but Korean restaurants are pretty rare. Not to mention actually good Korean restaurants are so hard to find. You can get sushi or Chinese on every corner, but it is hard to find a good Bibimbap, so when I first found SongCook, I was pretty impressed and excited.   This place is great. You can either sit in normal chairs or you have the chance to sit on the floor and eat in a more traditional manner. I tried the floor option, but it just did not work for me. Maybe, I need to start taking those Yoga classes.  On to the food, when first visiting I judge a Korean restaurant based on some staples. Bibimbap, pork bone soup, sides, etc. This place hands down has some of the best korean dishes around. The menu is big, so be prepared to find things that you haven't had before, not to mention you can have a lot of the dishes done differently.  Looking through the pictures, there is just so many dishes that look delicious that I want to try here. I can't wait till I come back to this location. Whatever you choose, I am sure you will love at SongCook. Thinking of getting some Korean? This is your new favorite spot."}
{"text":"We ordered the seafood pancake, kalbi, jajangmyun noodle, spicy pork stir-fry, sweet n sour chicken and a tofu soup with rice. Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu has better tofu soup and stone pot purple rice (cheaper too). The kalbi, chicken and pork stirfry were good but nothing mind-blowing, pretty standard. The pancake was a little too floury for my liking and not enough seafood filling to make up for the $15 price. The winner was the jajangmyun! The sauce was thick and flavourful but not over-seasoned. The noodles were chewy and fresh. I would go back just to eat the noodles.  The service, décor and size of the restaurant also fall into the pro column. (I didn't like sitting on the floor for that long though...maybe I'm just getting old. I went during the summer so I have no experience of this wonderful heated floor. Perhaps I could've liked it during winter?) The con would be the side dishes which are limited to kimchi (slightly bland), pickled radish and chopped, fresh sweet onions. I'm a huge fan of the many side dishes in Korean cuisine so that was a bit of a let-down.   Next time if I do go back I'd try the bibimbap and home-made noodles and of course, I'd order the jajangmyun!"}
{"text":"I must admit but this has been one of the best Korean restaurants I've been to. I've been here a few times with different groups of friends and have thoroughly enjoyed each experience.  It can get crowded so if you can make reservations ahead of time, it'd be better. You'll find there can be a crowd of people at the door, so check if there are seats available. They usually have the floor seats available as most people waiting usually want a table seat. If you are okay with sitting on the floor, go for it. However, it can get uncomfortable eating and floors can get hot. It depends on the person.   Also, must not forget the free soda for checking in! Just make sure they don't charge it on the bill. Our waiter accidentally put it on our bill and when we were paying/tipping we were a bit confused since it looked like i was leaving very little tip behind. That was when I realized they charged the soda, but the owner amended it later by giving us the change back.   The menu and pictures were nice aesthetically, however, I would have appreciated it if they labelled what food was each picture. The pictures were great, but it was hard to tell which was which as the pictures weren't very clear as to which food it was referring to on the menu. Ex.) \"Very delicious tofu stew\" and sometimes there would be more than one tofu stew.   Keep in mind when you get the stew, the rice is extra, but they will ask you whether you want rice with your stew and how spicy you like it. If you cannot tolerate spicy, let them know and perhaps ask for a little bit of spice which is what they recommend.   The bibimbap was delicious, but in general I love bibimbap. I've also had a set meal for 2 with the Kalbi and tofu stew and would defintiely recommend it. There's lots of food and my stomach was very satisfied! This place was accommodate for our fellow vegetarian friend as well which is what we needed!   As for parking, spots may be limited at the plaza so if you go in the evening, I would say park by the Central Montessori School area."}
{"text":"I arrived with a large party and ordered the set course menu for 6-7 people. The variety of dishes were given such as noodles, Sweet and Sour, Bimbimbap, and beef short ribs to name a few of the dishes in order H.   The food was authentic and fresh tasting especially in the Bimbimbap, which was served in a large bowl that we mixed together. The beef short ribs were stewed extremely and very tender. The noodles and the seafood vegetable soup were surprisingly bland, and lacking in flavour. The kimchi was extremely surprising as it was more of a salt laden side dish than a spicy one, and I felt that it was poorly prepared.   I tried to use the check-in coupon and get a free pop with a meal coupon on Yelp. The restaurant had a little trouble integrating it and in the end gave the free pop to us.   The waiting for a sitting table had a lineup, so my party and I sat down on the \"floor\" area with a more traditional eating arrangement. It was a different experience that made the dining more authentic. Really this is a 3.5 stars, but bumped down to 3 because I felt that some dishes were a bit lackluster."}
{"text":"I come here way too often for my own good.  I would have to agree with Edwin A. that the bibimbap is no good here.  However, definitely get the champong: spicy seafood noodle soup; or the jajangmyun: black bean sauce noodles.  They're the most well known dishes here at Song Cook's.  I had to write an update because of a new dish I discovered here called the nuroongjitang: crispy rice soup with veggies.  It's an appetizer, but it's ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  I shared it with 5 of my other friends.  I wasn't feeling the best (came down with a cold a few days before).  It was just soooo good.  Felt very \"homey.\"  They add a few rice crackers in it, which then softens in the soup.  LOVE IT.  Can't wait to get more of it next time I go."}
{"text":"Really good Korean food. Went with my huge family of 10 and ordered up a storm.   - pork bone soup  -sashimi salad  -fried dumplings  -glass noodles with veggies  -sweet and spicy chicken  #seafood pancake.   All really good and service was awesome. Despite the size of the place, and Pacific Mall-like partitions all over. The servers were  quick, courteous and organized.   Made a reservation first and was seated with the family in a lovely private enclosed canopy room."}
{"text":"This place is authentic and delicious and pretty reasonably priced. I came here while traveling for work, with my coworker and had a very filling lunch.  They give you a bunch of banchan (the small dishes with pickled vegetables, kimchi, and other snacks) to start out with.  We got the Haemul Pajeon (Seafood Pancake), which is one of my favorite Korean dishes and it was so good, filled with lots of seafood & octopus. It was sizzling in the skillet which made the bottom nice and crispy, and it was just delicious. It was enormous, maybe about 10\" in diameter. I could've just split this one thing with my coworker, but we wanted to try a bunch of things, so half of this went uneaten :(  Bibimbap - With lots of veggies (cucumber, carrots, mushrooms, seaweed), a runny egg, and beef, this was also delicious. Sometimes the bowl is not hot enough to make the rice crispy on the bottom, which is the best part -- but this was not the case here! The bowl was sizzling and browned the rice nicely!  Tteokbokki - I actually didn't like this dish, I felt like it was missing something else to balance out the rice noodles + sauce. The noodles were extra starchy and chewy, and it almost felt I was eating bubblegum because the chewing would never end. The sauce was good, but I'd pass on this dish.  I'd definitely come back here again for the pajeon and the bibimbap. We ordered too much food because we wanted to try a variety of dishes, but it wasn't bad at $20 per person."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but it is a little bit pricy. We spent around 30 dollars per person. Beef teriyaki is awesome and it tastes like authentic Korean food. It is good to have dinner with more people."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this restaurant is good, it's a rather large Korean restaurant with regular table seating and shoes off traditional Korean seating at low tables with your shoes off. I suppose the novelty of the Korean seating is partly what makes the experience feel authentic. Came on a Saturday night and it was packed, good thing we had reservations.   The food was okay, but not as tasty as I usually associate with Korean food. Now this may be down to personal preference (spicy not mild) and perhaps we ordered the wrong dishes there. My staple Korean dishes are seafood pancake (to share) and a kimchi based soup. There seafood pancake was pretty good, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. But, the dipping sauce was bland compared to other Korean places and there wasn't that much seafood inside for the almost $30 price tag. The kimchi soon tofu soup was good, but again lacked a punch that I'm used to getting in a kimchi stew. Also, rice wasn't included in the price of the soup, which was already considerably higher than most places in Koreatown at $12 for a medium (which looks like the usual size in most places). The Bibimbap was bland, but you could season it to your own taste, and they were able to accommodate our vegetarian friends by putting the meat on a side plate. We also had the seafood soup, sweet and sour chicken, and ddeokbokki (spicy rice cakes), which were all okay but not memorable. There were only 3 side dishes, which was disappointing, but at least they let you refill them.   Overall service was good. This is a good place for a big group as there are lots of tables and lots of sharing options, they can easily split your bills, and take credit card, but I would not return myself."}
{"text":"+ What I have tried: - Pork bone soup (4/5): was good but I have had better pork bone soup at Sunrise house with cheaper price and bigger portion - Kalbi LA grilled ribs (5/5): was the highlight of the night, really good but pricey tho, $21 for only 3 pieces of ribs lool  - Brown rice + barley (3/5): good but extremely sticky, more like stick rice, I still prefer white rice - Sashimi salad (4/5): salmon sashimi pieces were fresh and good amount of sashimi in the salad, was good overall - Five spice jokbal (4/5): pork hock pieces were extremely tender and huge portion but need more seasoning, it was a bit bland to me  - TangSuYuk (Sweet and Sour Pork) 1/5: the sauce smells soon strong, it hits up my nose before I even picked the meat up. Worst sweet and sour sauce I have ever tried in my life, much much worse than chinese food  - KhanPoungGi (Sweet and Spicy Chicken) 2/5: this sauce was not as strong as the pork one, but it was not much better than the pork. Don't recommend any sweet and sour meat here  - Samgyetang (chicken soup) 2/5: soup was bland, chicken was a bit hard and  lack of flavour so you have to use it with the salt they provided     + Portion: small compared to other korean restaurants      + Price: expensive, the food definitely not worth the price because I have experienced much much better elsewhere      + Place was very spacious, I have to say this is the best looking Korean restaurant I have been to      + Service was slow when it comes to taking orders, but everything went smoothly afterwards"}
{"text":"Me and my friends came here several times now and they don't disappoint. The first time we came, they offered us free soju which was nice. This time, I ordered the pork bone soup. I've tried pork bone soup at a lot of places and this place makes one of the better pork bone soups. There was plenty of meat in there and actually had good flavour. I do hate that you have to order rice separately for a lot of the soup based dishes. The side dishes also lacked variety this time around. The service here can be a hit and miss. It was busy this time around so the waiter really didn't pay much attention to us and we often had to try and flag him down for things. The first time I came, the waiter was very attentive. But in general, the food and the portions are really good so I would recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"No fault of the restaurant, but this place is a bitch to find.  The little strip mall is such that its entrance is easily missed and the restaurant sits under a bridge between two buildings without a sign on Steeles Avenue.  The food was good Korean, nice relishes with very spicy kim chee and damn cheap.  Note that the specials listed on a separate card are not on the menu and they don't give everyone in the same party the same info.  I'd up this to four stars if the servers could speak English a bit better.  I could understand if they were older people (it gets harder to learn a new language when one gets older), but the guy we had was really young.   Even if your patrons are mostly of the same ethnic group as your cuisine, you'll do better business if you forgo hiring FOB (fresh off the boat) folks as staff until they can learn the language of the country a bit btter.  Start them off as kitchen help or bussers instead!  He really had a lot of trouble understanding us."}
{"text":"Was recommended to this restaurant by a friend.  This place is hard to find, as it's hidden behind a car dealership and cannot be seen from Steeles Ave.  We ordered a few dishes including beef bone soup (one of my faves) and was pleasantly surprised as to how this hidden Korean restaurant could be so good!  The utensils were on the side of the table in a glass container (like an authentic Korean restaurant), and on the other side of the restaurant were large tables where you sit on the floor (also authentic Japanese/Korean).  On the weekday evening that we went, the place was packed with Koreans.  I'm rarely in the area unfortunately, but if I were I'd be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times, i can't believe I haven't written a review.  To sum up my experiences Song Cooks, it went from great to uh oh to so so to terrible.  Song Cooks suffers the same fate as most of the korean restaurants I've visited; inconsistent service and food quality.    As much as I'd like to remain a fan, the most recent visit that made my mom sick will be the last.  Her seafood soon-du-bu was basically and MSG soup with some frozen seafood and her \"special rice\" we had to pay extra for had bunch of grains that were under-cooked.    I wish there were better Korean restaurants in the GTA as Toronto really deserves a better caliber Korean food than this."}
{"text":"Love the layout of the place. It even has the floor seating. Service is great and really attentive. The food is as good as any authentic Korean restaurant but the only reason I have to take away 1 star is the limited side dishes and the pricing a bit higher than other Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for a friend's Birthday dinner.  The venue is a 4/5 : the private rooms provided a nice area for groups. Only down side to this is its more difficult to get a waiter's attention. especially when ringing the bell doesn't always ensure response.  Food: 3/5: Food was not bad but I've had better Korean food. My side of the table ordered a Samgyetang (ginseng chicken soup), bimbim Naengmyeon + Kalbi (cold noodles with beef short rib side) and Samgyeopsal-gui (grilled pork belly).  The Kalbi and grill pork belly was delicious! the Bimbim Naegmeyeon was also very good. But not a piece of Ginseng was found in the Samgyetang. And not even the distinctive taste was there. the soup was more bland then most places. The amount of sides was also lacking for a korean place. only kimchi, bean sprout and small portion of pickled veggie.   Price:  3/5 - Relatively similar to most Korean places but don't have set meals (soup meals don't come with Rice.. rice is $2 per bowl) also the fact that they don't provide as much side dishes means you're not getting as much bang for your buck.  Overall - 3/5 - not a bad venue especially for larger parties. Restaurant is quite large so there's an ease of getting a table. Other than that there's no really pizzazz that I found so far."}
{"text":"When I visited Toronto for vacation, I wanted to try some Korean food and went to this restaurant based on high reviews.  We ordered the Jjajangmeun and Jjambbong and some korean sweet and sour chicken dish. The service was good and it took a decent time for the food to be served. For the price, the amount of food we got was more than enough, we were very full. The taste of food wasn't amazing, but it was decent."}
{"text":"The quality of the food here is simply excellent. Our waiter Terry was very knowledgeable and recommended excellent dishes. We had Kal Bi Jim, a stew of beef with vegetables. It was to die for. The Five Spices Jokbal, pork hocks prepared with 5 spice, was also amazing. Terry also recommended an off-menu dish, a spicy seafood noodle soup in a white broth. It was simply delicious, with a rich and flavourful broth. We also had the Dduk Boki - rice-cake stir-fry in spicy sauce - as an appetizer and it was excellent as well. On a previous visit we tried the Samsun ChamPong - seafood noodle soup - which had the best broth of any I have had in recent memory, and the DdukKuk with dumplings - hand-made dumplings and rice cakes in a delicious broth. I could not possibly recommend this restaurant more highly. The floor seating with heated floors is an interesting experience as well, should you choose to try it."}
{"text":"The good: came for the Asia festival and they had a menu with everything I wanted to order (refer to picture for what was on the menu). Honestly this is one of my go to Korean place because 1) it's cheap 2) it's good 3) they have good jajangmyeon 4) good service 5) sweet and spicy chicken (dakgangjeong) is always good 6) their seafood rice cake soup was yummy!  The bad: it can get packed because it's so popular, even on weekdays it can get pretty busy.  The ugly: nothing too bad  Neutral: great for groups, cheap food."}
{"text":"Song cook alll day!! I believe this place has one of the best pork bone soups ever! Or at least the portion is massive! 5 gigantic pieces of deliciousness!   Their menu is epic as it has pictures with a ton of their food items! It is quite rare to come across menus that show you what you eat. Usually you order and it's not what you expect. Well with their elaborate snap chat picture menu(lol) you can see what you are ordering! I wish they gave more side dishes sadly!   This is located near galleria but more so beside the Moores store.   They have the most awesomeness offer or 1 free pop with your purchase and it's reusable. I'm done *drops mic*"}
{"text":"There Kimchi here was really good, I'm surprised it was a side dish. The free pop made it even more amazing. Although there really isn't much in terms of side dishes, the Kimchi made up for it. Very nice location inside. The food was pretty good except since I had gotten a combo, there didn't seem to be much noodles and lots of sauce. I'd still come back though."}
{"text":"Attentive service, great food, prices and environment. The menu has a lot of variety and different types of rice that they pride themselves for. Came here a handful of times and would come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Authentic Korean Cuisine keeps me coming back to SongCook's! The restaurant is located right by the Yonge and Steeles intersection in a quiet plaza (entrance is on Steeles but you can connect to the parking lot from Yonge by entering at Galleria).   The restaurant itself has an authentic floor seating area (where you remove your shoes) or regular table chair seating. I always opt for floor seating because it feels more authentic.   Service was excellent, with food being quick and the servers being timely and respectful.   There's a pretty wide selection in the menu and having visited a few times, food overall is excellent and very reasonably priced. Worthy mentions include the Jajanmyun (Korean Noodles in Black Bean Sauce), Rice Cakes and the Spicy Tofu Soup. Lastly the barley / bean rice is unique and worth a try if you're ordering a Korean style soup.  Overall, I'd recommend this place and would come back for more."}
{"text":"This is a big Korean restaurant! Very popular in the area!  Food - Hot and Fresh! Yummy! I love their Seafood pancake, the best one i had so far. The portion is big, good appetizer for a party of 4-6. I love their Black bean sauce noodle, not salty like most place. Their spicy, sweet and sour fried chicken is also very good.  You get 3-4 free side dishes - The Kimchi is good.  Unlike most Korean restaurants, this restaurant is big and spacious. Comfy seating. Nice atmosphere. Perfect place for big party (8 or more ppl).  Service is great! The servers are helpful and friendly in general.  Price - a bit higher than most Korean restaurants, but worth the money."}
{"text":"Good Korean-Chinese food!  We ordered jjajangmyeon + mandu, sweet and sour chicken, and dukbokki. All of the dishes were really good! The chicken dish was HUGE!   The were only a few side dishes unfortunately, but they were still good.   Service was great and attentive! Seating was comfortable and spacious."}
{"text":"Price is average there are to many pork options myself not eating pork i wish there were alternbative options bulgogi was nice and kimchi wish i couldve tried more and portions are small"}
{"text":"I have no complaints about this place. We were seated immediately. The service was very fast, the waiters were attentive, the food was great, very spacious, and you can tell if it's a clean by their washroom. The washroom actually smelled good and it was very clean. Furthermore, I got a free drink from checking in on yelp."}
{"text":"We arrived as a group of 4 and I think we ordered way too much food! There is regular seating on one side of the restaurant and traditional seating on the other. We decided to opt for the traditional seating and was pleasantly surprised given the heated flooring. Overall, food wasn't bad but nothing special. We had some rice cakes, beef ribs, seafood noodles in soup, jajang noodles, beef ribs and the pork belly. The pork belly is a must try and I recommend having it eaten in a vegetable wrap. The server also recommended us to get the beef rib dish but I was disappointed at the price for what we were getting."}
{"text":"Hands down best LA Kalbi ever.  I really liked the Dukbogi too. Dale the manager came to say hi, and was super friendly to us! He makes me want to go there again! Nice environment. The heated floor seating was quite an interesting experience"}
{"text":"This is THE place for Authentic Korean cuisines. It's tucked away in a nice plaza and I went here with  a girlfriend. The servers are very friendly and the food is so flavourful. The menu is a bit overwhelming as they have so many choices, but I decided to try something other than bimbimbap (which I always get).   We ended up with: JengBan JaJang - Stir fried veggies, seafood, ground beef and black bean sauce on noodle with a hint of chili oil   and Ddukbokki a spicy cake stiry fry featuring oden and egg (pictures attached).   It was delicious, reasonably priced and the food portions were generous and flavourful. I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Tasty and reliable Korean cuisine. One of the better places in Toronto. I've come here several times.   The portions for most dishes are large and meant to share.  Relaxed and casual atmosphere. They hold karaoke nights, too!   The waitstaff are friendly and attentive.   The washrooms are clean and well kept."}
{"text":"Korean restaurants usually follow the same model in the city.  It's tried and tested so there's no reason to fiddle around with something that works.  SongCooks offers some refreshing different items from the Nakwon's and Owls.  Not that there's anything wrong with Nakwon (I love Nakwon personally), it's just nice to have something different.  Pros: Very spacious, this place is the biggest Korean restaurant I've been too. Very friendly staff Different fare from your average Korean restaurant. Steamed Ribs..  *drools*  Cons: Prices are a tad higher than what you see elsewhere Not as many free side dishes at other Korean places  The first thing you notice when you get inside is how spacious it is inside.  They have a lot of room in there.  We were a party of 8 people on a saturday night and as busy as it was inside, we were sat in no more than 10 minutes.  The decor is simple, yet nice.  Very clean place.  We ordered a variety of your standard dishes with some choices not seen at other Korean restaurants.  There was a grilled fish dish, deep fried sweet and sour chicken.  My favourite though, by far were the steamed ribs.  We're talking fall of the bone tender ribs..  I'm drooling just thinking about them again.  The food is well prepared, definitely above average.    The staff was very friendly and understanding.  It was our first time so we had tons of questions.  Our waiter was very patient and asnwered the questions the best he could.  His english was not the best, but he was doing his best and that's all you really want.    After we ordered, I was surprised to see we only got one medium sized dish of kimchi.  I guess we're all spoiled by the other places giving us 7/8 dishes worth of side dishes.  It's something free so it's not something I should really complain about at all.  It's just nice to have.  The main gripe has to be the prices.  It's not a huge thing either.  Not enough to keep me away at least.  You will notice they are about 1/2 dollars higher than other places.  It doesn't urk me as much as it may you.  My ribs cost $10 for a small portion and $20 for a large.  For $20, I guess I expected a little more than what I got, but like I said, it's minor gripe.  All in all, if you're a fan of Korean cuisine do give this place a try.  It'll be something different.  This is definitely an establishment I will go back to.  Nakwon and Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu are still my go to's as I'm right across the street, but this is a close second."}
{"text":"My friend recommended me to this restaurant for the longest time. I've always wanted to try it but it's so out of my way to come here since I live in Scarborough. The number one thing is that there's free parking so now I know I can conveniently drive here and not worry about parking. As with other Korean restaurants, there were four banchan to start off our meal. My favourite was the bean sprout and I didn't really like the other three. For my main meal, I ordered the noodle with soy bean paste. This seems to be my favourite dish to get at any restaurants that offer it! I have no complaint about this dish at all. The service here was excellent. The staff was very friendly and courteous. I would definitely come back here to try some of their other dishes!  If you do check in to this restaurant, you can receive a free coke so don't forget to do that!"}
{"text":"We came here the first time on a Friday night. We chose the kneeling seats and found it extremely cute! The menu is a bit pricier than typical Korean food you find near Finch, but trust me it is totally worth it! The food tastes great and the portion is huge! The two of us got a LA kalbi and spicy don kasu. We were so full afterwards! Cannot wait to go back and try other items on the menu! :)"}
{"text":"I've had SongCook's in Mississauga, enjoyed it. My friends and I had a craving for black bean noodles and Korean food in general so we decided to head to SongCooks in Vaughan. I had a feeling it would be busy so I called ahead and asked if they can prepare a table for us. The Manager said he would try his best. They have both chair seating and floor seating here.   When we arrived, there weren't a lot of people waiting but the restaurant was fulled. They end up seating us in the party room (where they usually do karaoke). It was a bonus for us because they end up turning on the Raptors game for us while we ate. Score! 11 in a row!   The server who came by was super friendly. My friend and I kindly showed her our check in for a free pop ;). We all end up ordering black bean noodles, tonkatsu, pork bone soup, tofu stew and sweet and sour pork. I was going to order dumpling soup....because I had a craving and the lady gave a look like (you don't want to order this - lol). So I end up changing to tofu stew. My meal was okay, we all tried a bit of each others meals. I really enjoyed the tonkatsu that my friends had, the black bean noodles were also good and sweet and sour pork. My tofu stew was a little overly spicy for me, but that's what I get for forgetting to ask for less spicy.   Overall my experience at this location was great. I will definitely be back! I really liked our server, she was funny and kind."}
{"text":"My favorite here is their black bean noodles &sweet sour pork combo, and I order it almost everytime I come here, usually for dinner. Their combo portion is also good for swap-sharing, I usually get a different combo with my friends just so we can swap our side dishes. This place is clean, relatively spacious. Service was good, service speed was decent as well. Overall experience was decently enjoyable."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday with a group of friends. I love korean food and chose this place due to the high reviews. Upon walking in, the venue was a lot classier than what we were expecting. It was also extremely spacious with a variety of different seating options.   The appetizer that came were radish served in 3 different ways as well as kimchi. Someone unique was the radish thinly sliced into squares and served with soya sauce (+ vinegar + oil). It was very sour.   We got the Beef short ribs as recommended by my friend, rice cakes, and fresh noodles (Sorry, I don't remember the exact names for everything).  The ribs had a yummy, light + sweet sauce. It was a bit expensive for the portion. There were 7 pieces of beef (1 was a bone with no meat). The rice cakes also came in a small portion. There were a few rice cakes, and 2 giant pieces of fish cake that didn't make it that good to share with 4 people. The rice cakes were chewy and the sauce wasn't fully soaked into it, making the rice cakes only ok. Would not order from here again.   Each of us ordered a different noodle dish since they make the noodles here fresh each day. I think I got L2. The server called it a soup but it was like a super saucy dry noodle dish. The sauce was very thick and held onto the noodles well. I liked how the dish was not oily! I loved the texture and taste of the noodles. However, some of my friends commented that their noodle dishes were too plain. The sauce didn't penetrate the noodles and they tasted only plain noodles. One of my friends who usually eats anything, didnt even finish his dish for this reason and ended up eating something else (he got the original black bean). My noodles were also delightfully spicy and had a good amount of seafood. There were several pieces octopus and shrimp. My friend who got the seafood jajangmyun said that her dish only had 1 shrimp and 1 mussel, hardly making it a worthy seafood dish.   The noodle portions are very large. Half of us got takeout boxes and had enough leftovers for a second meal. The price of noodles was worth!  Overall I would only come here again for the fresh and largely poritioned noodles."}
{"text":"I like to come here once in a while for their cha cheang meon (however that's spelled) and their mandoo soup. It's just comfort food. Compared to the other korean places this one gives the least complementary side dishes. They only give you raddish and kimchi. That's all. The one thing that is interesting about the place is their selection of rice and noodles. They have all these healthy choices you can choose from. The portion for the price here is so so compared to other places you go on Yonge and Finch. i would say is a 3.5 star place for me."}
{"text":"I've been to SongCook's for years now and they never disappoint! Service is always wonderful and the food is very consistent to our likings. Their tea is also so delicious! My family and friends never turn this place down when we decide to go eat there. The restaurant is also pretty spacious. It's got regular tables and a section to sit on the floor (never sat there but if you can sit with your legs crossed for 2 hrs, good for you!) I highly recommend their dolsot bibimbap and their LA kalbi. Super yummy!!"}
{"text":"Their bibimbap is the best thing here.  Tried other offerings like their fried chicken and champong/jajangmyun combo.  Really doesn't live up to their bibimbap in stone bowl (dolsot).  Decor is nice. There's a section to right of entrance that seats in the floor and is heated."}
{"text":"Food = 2.5stars Atmosphere/decor = 4stars Service = 3 stars  Nothing special on the food. 24.99 for a large japchae that was too oily and had minimal beef. The special kalbi L4 was soft and tender but a bit on the sweeter side for me. Side dishes variety not big for lunch.  For a larger group gathering the space is huge and accomodating. Food wise its really not that great and felt we overpaid. I prefer Oh Geul Boh Geul for a cozy whole in the wall type with great food and Piggy Piggy for a bigger space with great flavours."}
{"text":"I would have to recommend you not to order the set menus. The seafood pancake and the sweet and sour pork were basically flour donuts. No seafood other than some basic frozen squid... And the pork was bland and boring. I can't believe they sell the seafood pancake for $35, they are trippin'!  In my honest opinion, they have just way too much going on. A Korean menu and a Korean-Chinese menu, all in one. The kitchen is doing way too much to be superb at anything. The clientele of this place is majority foreigners so I am betting that they don't have to show up with their A+ game. My friends were impressed as they were new to this whole Korean thing, but as a native and a veteran to this food ish, this gets a meh rating from me. The service is lackluster also. The dude who's working the front is always on the move, trying to help, but every other server has to be a student of some sort trying to get their weekly pay to go drink and do karaoke in the wonderful city of Toronto."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for a few years.   Decent food for a decent price.   From the traditional pork bone soup to other dishes.   Prices have gone up for sure and also the rice is not included with the soup dishes.  They have a traditional seating area with no chairs.   Decent place for once in a while."}
{"text":"We came here at an odd time (3-4pm) and there were only 2 other tables occupied. We were welcomed immedietly and seated at a huge table.  Our server came to take our order soon after we decided on what to get. I got a small hot bowl soup(?) and we shared a plate of spicy rice cake. Food was average korean food, nothing stood out. Can't say much about authenticity, but I have definitely had better at a lower price point too. None of the free small plates/dishes blew our mind either. On the other hand, we did not wait long at all for the food to arrive, and our server checked up on us frequently.   Service was great, food is average."}
{"text":"I had to drive far to try this place, but man was it worth it. The servers did their best to help me find what I was looking for in taste. I ended up getting the Pork bone soup with a side of white rice. It was very flavorful and hardy.  The restaurant was not kinda dim in lighting. and the bathrooms were clean.  They do not have dessert."}
{"text":"First time for a family dinner on the weekend (Sat). My daughter was craving for some ddukbokki and I found this place online with it on the menu. Ddukbokki was good, not very spicy, rice cake had a nice consistency. Also ordered YuSeul JaJang and JengBan JaJang noodles. Both dishes didn't look very appetizing (plating) reminding me of rushed cafeteria food slapped onto a plate and were a bit on the sweeter taste, glossy (oily) noodles were soft nearing overcooked but overall the dishes were satisfactory. Service was good. Warrants another trip to see about consistency of food quality."}
{"text":"Excellent traditional korean dishes i had here.  If you go at the right time, there is even a karaoke place you can go up and have some drunken fun.   We ordered ja jang myuen.  Which is korean because it is sweet where as the shanghai/ chinese ja jang is spicy.  Ja jang is black bean sauce.  The beef ribs and the pork is really good.  Make sure to bring more people to try out their food as when i went, we did not have enough stomach room to finish all the delightful dishes"}
{"text":"I don't know too many Korean dishes or restaurants but Songcook's was delicious.   To start, the staff were all extremely friendly and made the experience fun. Our server Diana was described as a 'hoot' and I completely agree. She was friendly, offered suggestions on the menu and really funny.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of my dish but it was a soup with pork, glass noodles and veggies. It was so good! It also mixed really well with the bowl of rice included.  Overall I really enjoyed this restaurant and would come back the next time I'm looking for Korean food."}
{"text":"The food was okay.  But 3 adults shared 2 main dishes and it still came $20 per person is a bit expensive.  One was a few fried chicken pieces on lettuce.  One was braised beef with carrots/potatoes.  Service was great, setting was fine, just a bit over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"My friend takes me here whenever I feel like  Korean Food.   It's pricey compare to other Korean restaurants but the food was pretty decent. My boyfriend always orders beef teriyaki and he loves it. I tried and it's actually very good. Tasty, not too salty, not too plain. I, like usual, will always order stew. Even I order small size for the soup but I can never finish it. The soup was okay but not savoury enough.  I just don't like the fact that we always have to wait to be seated because it's always packed in here. The service is a bit slow, but I don't blame them. This place is always busy!!  I will come back but will not my top choice for Korean food!"}
{"text":"Food is good. But very limited side dishes. Compared to all the Korean spots in the area. The side dish option is very limited."}
{"text":"- Their service was great  - They have actual korean table seating where you have to cross your legs on the elevated wooden floor. It's an interesting experience but if you're not used to it, your legs get sore and numb after awhile. The floor is heated by the way.  - Maybe we didn't order enough of other food. The Ginseng chicken soup was disappointing. Not enough ginseng and chicken taste. Very lightly flavoured. The pork bone soup was okay. I had better ones before. The side dishes were disappointing too.. too little choices and they weren't even good."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant based on its reviews and the fact that they have the traditional tatami seating.  A warning to those that don't like low seating or sitting cross-legged while eating - you may want to opt to sit in the regular section of the restaurant.  We ordered the pork bone soup and the blackbean noodle combo with pan-fried dumplings.  Personally I found the pork bone soup a bit oily and less flavorful than many other Korean restaurants I have been to.  The noodles were just average.  Don't think this place warrants a second visit, at least not for me."}
{"text":"So I did enjoy this place, although I felt the prices were a little high. Every time I come I try a different dish and I've found that it's never bad and I'm always able to finish it. But I always leave with the feeling that I paid a little too much for what I had. For example, once I ordered the chicken broth and although it was quite tasty it was a small portion and only half a chicken. Also I ordered the jajang+Kampoogi combo and it was also around $18 for a pretty small portion. I just felt that I could get a big bowl of jajangmyun and a big plate of Kampoogi for the same price.  But it's always a nice experience here, the staff is really nice and the traditional seating is fun. :)"}
{"text":"I recently took up dance classes with my husband for our wedding day.  This was our little hidden secret that we always had!!!   We always went there, the food is so good and so cheap.  We'd leave super full for under $20 and that is tough to do!   I always got the soup and my husband got the beef.   I would definitely recommend this place!  All the servers are nice, and the manager!  When they gave us a free dessert of sesame balls I knew my mother would love it and asked for a few to take home and they gave me a small box of them!!!  Wonderful place"}
{"text":"Place is alright.  Food was ok, i'm reserving my judgement because we didn't get to try enough of the menu, i had kids with me so I couldn't order the spicy foods.  Best thing about this place was the service.  Tea was refilled regularly, and waiters walking around and checking on us.  Kids enjoyed the chicken katsu and the shashimi salad, goes well with the soy sauce."}
{"text":"Got the free pop! We were a big group so we ordered the set dinner for 9-12 people, for a party of 10 that really was enough.   It was my first experience sitting on the floor eating, besides having to adjust my sitting position every few minutes due to years of not stretching it was a fun experience and I love the heated floor.  The service was great. The food was equally good, my only complaint is that the cups all had a bleach smell."}
{"text":"This place has a unique taste of Korean cuisine. The taste is good and delicious but the food is rather more American inspired Korean than the authentic Korean taste. It came with the originals starters (kimchi, bean sprouts, etc) and overall taste was great. Not to mention, the food only took about 10-15 minutes to come out. As for the menu, they had a great selection.   The service here was very good. The waiters were really nice and knew Korean. The interior was really nice also. There are 2 sections to the restaurant. One is the regular sitting and the other is the traditional Korean where there are no chairs.    I would go back if I was in the area. I would go back and try the different foods. I would recommend this to a friend. 3.5 stars/5"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and each time I get the black bean noodle combo I'm not disappointed. I just love those noodles! The texture of the noodles is just right, and the sauce is not overly sweet and has just the right balance of meat to onion ratio.   I like the seafood noodle soup the second best. I don't know, something about the spicy kick is just so addicting. The sweet and sour chicken is pretty decent too, maybe sometimes too floury.  I like the tonkatsu as well, the portion is great and the meat properly breaded and fried. Personally I prefer the same dish over at Galleria food court though, which has a unique sauce that makes theirs stand out.   The side dishes at SongCook's are not the best though... I don't really like those strange (maybe authentic) dishes and wish I could have my usual glass noodle, sea weed, sweet potato, or even fish cake :(  Some of their soup are also hit-or-miss, sometimes burnt and sometimes way to sour, maybe just a matter of personal taste though.  Overall, I will go back and back again for my black bean noodle cravings, and would like to one day try the BBQ too."}
{"text":"Food is tasty.  Portions are getting smaller.  Food was delivered family style.  Table service is nonexistent.  We had to serve ourselves.  We realized the overall performance of the restaurant is beginning to decline.  You have been warned."}
{"text":"Okay, so I was not expecting this place to be in the plaza AT ALL. I was looking for it and upon turning into the plaza I thought I had the wrong place. Its on the north west block of Yonge and Steeles avenue. Don't turn into the staples plaza like I did though!! It is the entrance between the Honda dealership and the Staples plaza.   Anyways- this is place is F&$9ing busy!!! I am not sure if it is always like this, but when we were leaving, we must have walked by 12 different groups waiting for a spot. The restaurant was full to the brim and rightfully so.   First impression was awesome. Our waiter was super friendly and despite us having a sort of large group, he managed us all by himself. He was also patient and explained everything from the different kinds of appetizers he was bringing out, to what his suggestions were.   I have so much love for asian cuisine whether it be Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Taiwanese, Vietnamese, Indian etc...Korean food however, is the one that I have no experience with. I learned really quick though that I ought to pay more attention to Korean cuisine because there are some awesome foods!   For appetizers, I tried a couple things. Firstly, the dumplings (Sohn Mandu, A6, $13.99/L)  which were awesome and filled with juicy meat. They are okay in term of price at less than 1$/piece. Next was A9, Dukbokki ($8.99). This is a must try!!! They are chewy rice cakes in a delicious sauce. They are sort of shaped like short, super thick noodles, and they are delish.   For my main dish, I had Ganjajang (N4). It is basically a massive portion of fresh drawn noodles and black bean sauce. I don't know if I was full from all of the kimchi and dumplings, but I could barely eat half of it. It was delicious while it lasted though. The one criticism I have is that it is not as heavy on the meat as chinese joints are. But then again, the Japanese get away with only 1 or 2 pieces of meat in ramen. Scratch that... this place is all round awesome.   Incredible service.  Delicious food.  You will not pay an arm and a leg.  Oh, and fresh pulled noodle dishes."}
{"text":"This review is late by a few months.. Sorry..  Food is good, portions are good, atmosphere good, server on this specific visit in the end of spring  .. I've come to this location almost a dozen times and this was probably the first time I've encountered this staff and his poor behaviour.. Hence, the overall rating of 3 rather than a 4.  For arguing with my mother and then not dropping the issue and coming back to argue about it some more.. I give that server a 0 and that experience a 1, but in all fairness, my overall experience at this place would be a 3.5. For Korean food and ambience with the new renovations.. I'm glad the other server came to smooth things over and inform us that the particular server we had, was too aggressive and had gotten into arguments with other patrons.. if he's still there, hope no one else has gotten him..   Other than that great Korean food.. I especially like their ja jiang mien.. (Black been noodles) you can try it in a combo with the fried sweet and sour pork.. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I'd give bonus points to this restaurant for its location and plenty of parking spaces. As for food, last time I checked, it's run by Koreans but their food could taste better.   -If you're deciding between JaJangMyun and ChamPong, their JaJangMyun is better than ChamPong. Or try their JaJangMyun Combo #1 and get both.     -Their soft tofu soup is average; get it from other Korean restaurants.  -If you're getting a dish that comes with a bowl of rice or that you may have to order rice separately, try different kinds of rice; not every Korean restaurant has this many selection and some of these rice mixed with barley and/or beans is supposed to be healthier than plain white rice.  -Kalbijim is pretty good.  -LA Kalbi tastes similar to the one you'd get in other Korean restaurants in the Yonge & Finch area.  My friends commented on how nicely decorated this restaurant was. This place reminded me somewhat of traditional Korean wooden houses. It's definitely not a dressy and pricey place though. Sitting options are either at a table or on a floor with your shoes off (Why on the floor; it's Korean ondol culture)."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food, great service. This is the best place to get awesome food. A bit on the pricier side for Korean food but once your see the portions and quality your wallet won't feel it. If Korea food is your thing, go here... you'll be impressed and full."}
{"text":"Another place that was a waste of money due to useless Yelp reviewers. Ordered the Kam ja tang and for $10 it did not include the rice. Well, the bones were of low quality and the broth plain. Sometimes I pity people who can't cook real good quality food at home so they go out to eat crap."}
{"text":"I eat Korean food at least once a week, and I can't believe this was my first time here.   I have to say that the food here is actually a lot better than other Korean restaurants in the GTA. The ingredients look and taste fresh. There are also healthier options for rice, and trust me, their rice is done well.   My friends and I decided to come here for Thanksgiving dinner, and we ended up ordering the giant bowl of  (mixed rice with meat and veggies) and  (sweet and sour pork). The veggies with the soft brown rice were a great combination and highly satisfying. The pork was crispy and coated with the perfect amount of sauce. We also ordered some flavored  (rice wine), from which they have 4 options.   The place was bustling with people all night,  yet the staff was super friendly and helpful. The place was clean with plenty of seating, and even private sectioned areas.   I highly recommend this place as the food was delicious, and the environment made the whole experience that much better.   P.S. the prices are on the higher side, but I'm willing to spend extra on good food and service."}
{"text":"First off, if you're hungry and can't decide then get one of their combos! Really good value and a ton of food, i get it every time i go here.  The one i love is their Jjajangmyeon (black bean noodles) + kang pung ki (sweet/crispy chicken) for ~$14. Both are very well made (definitely not my favourite Korean place), but always consistently tasty. Sometimes it's hard to get the waiters attention.  The decor is really nice and they've got a ton of tables so even when it's busy (which this place almost always is) you get seated fairly quickly.  They've also got the low tables (where you sit on the floor) for the flexible. Tons of parking in the area so that shouldn't be an issue.  There's a big party room thats semi-separated so it would be good for a group (probably could hold 30 people without an issue).  It's also got a big projection screen in there.  I think the staff are NBA fans, because all the TV's were set to the game when i was there."}
{"text":"I want to give Song a 3.5 star. Came here twice last month and I can say this place is not bad if you want a one stop shop all kind of Korean restaurant. Be prepared to wait in line on weekends it's a very popular spot for families in the area.  My friends are huge fans of Song's Ja Jang Myun (black bean sauce thick noodles), I liked it too I think their noodles are perfectly chewy and fresh! Song's dishes are fairly budgeted and huge. We also ordered a dol sop bibimbap and it was Aok. I really loved their steam dumplings, the dough was so fresh, moist and the filling was juicy. =)  I am not a huge fan of their gam ja tang (pork bone soup).. the soup wasn't sizzling hot and the soup base was lacking flavours.   In general, I think Song has done a great job catering its neighbourhood's needs. Definitely come here for their Ja Jang Myun!  Service: 3/5 Food: 4/5 Location: 3/5 Ambiance: 3/5 Overall: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"The $9 JaJang Myun (N1) noodles with black bean sauce is a pretty good deal considering that the sauce is genuinely tasty. It's also their most popular dish on the menu. I went with the higher priced YuSeul Jajang ($15) and I found that I didn't get much extra in value for the additional $6. Overall, it's an authentic place with a peculiar decor. The service was great and our server was very helpful. Would I go back? If I'm craving a bibimbap or some other Korean dish, maybe. Considering that I try to eat more vegetarian and raw vegan foods in the summer, I don't see myself going back there anytime soon. But it doesn't take away from the tasty Korean food they serve. In my opinion, they deserve 4 stars."}
{"text":"Our go to place for Jajangmyun - black bean noodle. They also have pork bone soup and also hot pots that we want to try. it's cool that they have Asian booths and lower tables where you can sit on the \"floor\""}
{"text":"Food is soso. Just your typical Korean restaurant quality. The price is way over-priced, plus you have to pay extra for rice which is ridiculous.  Nice interior, and good service though.  Just not worth paying extra for what you get."}
{"text":"Food was tasty, service was fast, and I do like the traditional Korean seating there. The restaurant gave me a feeling of authentic. Very nice place. But if you plan to go on weekends, it's better to have reservations."}
{"text":"I should first add a disclaimer that this is my girlfriend's favourite and go-to restaurant for Korean food. I, however am more of a Korean food noob.   We came here for lunch. I had ordered the kamjatang and she had the jajungmyun, with a side of bulgogi for the both of us.   Maybe I don't know what kamjatang is supposed to taste like, but it was different than I'm used to. The soup was very tomatoey, and thick. There was a chunk (half a potato) that had not cooked down very much. It was semi-cooked and still hard. I do have to give them points that there was A LOT of meat. They were very generous with the amount of pork bones in the soup. Aside from the potato, I did still enjoy the meal.  The side dishes were also less than I'm used to. I guess they have less available at lunch time. Kind of disappointing because my favourite side dish is the sweet syrup potatoes.   The service here was EXCELLENT. They were prompt, friendly, and overall very good. Maybe it was just an off day, but I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and give it another try."}
{"text":"A very descent, large, clean, authentic Korean restaurant with nice setting, good service, good fresh food and very decent pricing.  Would be a good 4 stars for sure if I was a fan of Korean food, as I left feeling OK but not that more impressed than I could have been in any other clean Korean restaurant. I expected maybe a little more from this place and still miss the woaa factor in Korean food (a white guy review... just personal taste... otherwise surely a very good Korean spot)."}
{"text":"We came here for the \"CMYE: Yelp's International Supper Club: Korean\".  It was a great evening.  The place serves fantastic traditional Korean fare in a very cozy atmosphere.  It is one of the better Korean places I've been to.  We had many of the popular Korean dishes.  Some of the highlights for me were the Kalbi short ribs, which were sinfully good. The Gamjatang pork bone soup was superb.  It was very hearty and deep in flavour.  It would probably make for a perfect winter stew.  In the summer, you might want to keep the cold beer nearby.  The pork belly was of course delicious.  It came with lettuce for making a wrap.  That is, if you even have the patience for making a wrap when there's pork belly in front of you.  The restaurant is quite attractive.  It is large and elegant.  We sat on the floor in traditional fashion.  It's a fun way to eat.  I would imagine it would be fun for families with kids, because - let's face it - that's how they eat at home.  The evening was ever more delightful thanks to Dale, who is the Owner/Manager.  He came over to our table and described the food in great detail.  He's young, energetic, and passionate about the family business.  He's passionate about his food, and passionate about his Korean+Canadian heritage.  We had a lot of questions about Korean food, and he explained some of the origins and traditions (like the origin of the Korean Fried Chicken.)  We learned that aside from this business, Dale is involved with the production of a play called \"Kim's Convenience\".  In the past, I recall seeing postings for it at the Young People's Theatre.  I haven't personally seen it, but I recall the reviews were quite good.  To wash all the good food down, we got some Soju.  We had the traditional Soju and also the wine Soju.  We've learned that the wine Soju is a Toronto original.  It's the product of a melting pot city where the tradition Korean Soju meets the Niagara white wine and form a nice partnership.  As Dale said it - that's his identity, put in a bottle.  Thanks to all the dear fellow Yelp diners for making this such an enjoyable evening.  Thank you Kris for organizing (and contributing to) this fantastic International Supper Club event."}
{"text":"Songcook's is a popular spot for Korean food amongst my friends and there's good reason for it. They're good with large groups (obviously, call and reserve in advance) and their food is on par with some favourites of my own.  I was really in the mood for noodles and of course, I had to order the  jajangmyeon and kkampongi combo.   Comparing the jajang to other places, the black bean sauce is a tad on the savourier side and the noodles are slightly softer, allowing the sauce to stick nicely.  The kkampongi is fried very well, and you get that crunch from start to finish - something that doesn't happen often. The sauce is mild in spice (despite the restaurant mentioning it having a slight kick) but is perfectly sweet.  We had a birthday here, and the waiters/waitresses were more than happy to take it in with no hassle.  I can see why this place is popular. It definitely warrants another visit. I'll definitely be back for the spicier dishes :)"}
{"text":"Nice korean restaurant just behind Galleria. There was a bit of a wait but no more than ten minutes and we were seated. There's a ticketing system when waiting so be sure you get your number in.   Menu looks quite authentic and it's a little intimidating to order from if you aren't familiar with korean cuisine. Popular dishes had images included so maybe stick with those for first timers. Cabbage kimchi is fresh and probably the best I've had in any restaurant.   I couldn't decide what to get so stuck with the classic pork bone soup. Meat was fall off the bone and tender. Rice is extra but there is a variety of rice to choose from for those more health conscious. We also ordered the spicy seafood jajangmyeon which tasted kind of bland and was definitely not spicy. That was a bit disappointing.  Overall I would come back to try other dishes as there is a lot more options here that I don't usually see in other korean restaurants."}
{"text":"A lovely Korean restaurant with a variety of hearty, delicious traditional Korean foods! They have almost every traditional Korean dish you can think of!   Service and Environment: This restaurant is pretty big with ample tables and seating areas. They also have a traditional seating area where you can sit comfortably on their heated floor! Furthermore, they also have small dining private dining rooms for special events and occasions.  Service is amazing, the servers are very kind and are always making sure you feel welcomed, comfortable and at home. They are always around and will come to you immediately if you need something.  Food: I've visited this place quite a few times and have some personal favourite menu items such as... - Jajangmyeon - The traditional black bean paste noodles with pork and potatoes! Love how they add the potatoes in; although it may look like there is too much sauce, this dish is actually really light but flavourful at the same time! - KalBiJjim - a must try if you're a beef fan! It's basically steamed beef ribs that is very tender with a delicious light sauce! Portions are pretty huge so I would share this dish! - Seafood Tofu Soup and Pork Bone Soup  - Bulgoki Bokeum with wrapped vegetables!"}
{"text":"Searching for an authentic Korean cuisine with an affordable price? Look no further. Located in the middle of the GTA, Song Cook's offers a wide variety of traditional dishes in a mix of cultural and urban atmosphere. The venue is large with sub-sections designed for decent-sized gatherings. The service is above average; although, the waiters seem to lack a sense of urgency even when swamped with customers. Dishes range from $7.99 - 13.99 for single servings and family combos are offered to save a few extra dollars when dining with 3+ persons. Portions are pretty generous as well. Overall, I give Song Cook's 3.5/5 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place!   Further north than the congestion of Korea Restaurants at Yonge and Finch, Song Cook's can be found tucked away behind the Galleria Supermarket at Yonge and Steeles.   Don't be deceived by it's hidden view - this place is huge inside! But don't take that for granted - it can get quite busy on weekends so best to make a reservation if you can.   They have regular seating and traditional floor seating which is great, but can be hard for people with knee or back problems.  Food to get: Their Jajangmyeon is probably the best in the area, their sweet and spicy fried chicken is amazing (may seem pricey but HUGE portion), their Dukboki is spicy and saucy, and their kamjatang and soon tofu can stand up to the competition. I have yet to have a dish I don't like there :)  Marginally more expensive than some korean joints, but worth it as the food quality is much much better (less fast-food like).  Would I return? - Absolutely Parking? - Yes, a lot Value for $? - Good Space? - Large inside/good sized waiting area Ventilation? - Good Service? - Great"}
{"text":"We ordered: Pork bone soup - really good, lots of meat, soup not too oily/salty, but doesn't come with rice?! Black bean noodles - Good and flavorful sauce. Noodles were chewy and had a nice bite.  Ginseng soup with full chicken - the \"full\" chicken is the size of your fist, so it was expensive for a little bowl of soup! The broth is clean tasting but bland nonetheless. They give you actual pieces of ginseng in the soup.  Beef short ribs - Really flavorful! JapChae - $20+ for a regular plate of glass noodles! It tastes good, but was completely overpriced esp given the ingredients used were nothing special. I wouldn't pay more than $12 for this. It really left a bad taste knowing the charged this much for this dish.  Overall, the place is big, clean and spacious. Servers were very attentive and helpful. Food is flavourful but portions are on the small side and prices  on the expensive side."}
{"text":"This place is one of my Korean staples - literally it's behind the Staples and can easily be missed if you're not familiar with the area.   There is often a wait, especially on weekend evenings. I can always count on them for some jajangmyun and pork bone soup and the service is good.   Check in with the Yelp app to get a free pop!"}
{"text":"Been here a lot, good food! Tried their kimchi tofu soup, pork bone soup, spicy soup less noodles with red sauce (# N5), beef bibimbap (although the beef servings is small), and beef teriyaki with rice and miso soup (beef is very sweet). The sides dishes are not that good, and you have to add 2$ for rice for the soups. Unlike other stores, rice is usually included for soups.  Nice seating areas with one large TV. You have an option to sit on the floor (traditional) or a table. Washrooms are a bit old and outdated."}
{"text":"Song Cook's have to be one of the nicest Korean/Chinese Restaurant I have been to.  When I was greeted by this young Korean man that speak perfect English asking if I want to sit at the table or at the warm seating platform, I know it will be different from the other places I visit.  Prices wise, I am surprise how affordable the prices are. All the items are priced under $10!!   And this place is perfect for solo diner like me that could not make up their mind since they have 1 person Combo!! Now I can try more than 1 dish without stuffing myself crazy or paying double the price!  Half JaJangMyun + Half ChamPong (Veg, beef, black bean sauce on noodles & spicy seafood noodle soup) - $8.50 - the portions are huge!! I was full after eating the soup noodles... - Spicy Seafood broth was quite spicy and rich.. not that waterdown version.. definitely have a nice kick to it.. - The seafood though is really small... baby versions of everything... shmrips, squids and mussels - The Korean version of the black bean sauce noodles was good too. Not too salty with a lot of onions inside.. if you don't like eating onions, you might have to skip this dish.. and of course more raw onion on the side if you want extra! - Noodle are Homemade... a little chewy with a lot of bite... really light not floury at all.  All the waitstaffs at Song Cook's speaks perfect English so you will have no problem asking questions about the menu... and if you want to practice your Korean too, you are more than welcome. They are all polite and helpful... + 1 star to that!!  No lunch Specials though... but with their price, the quality of their food and services and the nice deco... they don't need lunch specials to bring in the crowds!  They accepts Amex, Mastercard, Visa and Interac."}
{"text":"I got to the restaurant at around 8pm with a party of 6. The restaurant was still fairly busy, so we were told that we had to wait for a table, or could be seated quickly on the \"floor\" area. Since we did not feel like waiting, we opted for the floor seating, which made the experience more authentic. To make the process of ordering easier, we also ordered the set menu for 6-7 people, which included dishes such as black bean noodles, sweet and sour pork, bibimbap, seafood soup, and beef short ribs.  The food was pretty authentic, and overall tasty and well seasoned. Although there was a bit too much food, I would definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a friend, and it was some of the best authentic Korean food I've had in Toronto. In my opinion, the food was better than any Korean restaurant I've been to at Yonge and Finch. This is going to be my new go to spot for Korean food.  The portions were very generous and I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu.  We got the seafood pancake and a bibimbap to share between the 2 of us and it was more than enough food. This place is on the pricier side but totally worth it considering the amount of food we got."}
{"text":"The food here is really good! The jajangmyeon was delicious and so was the jjamppong although it was really spicy. I also liked the banchan they gave. I got to try some bamboo shoot dish and the sweet and sour pork too. Both were delicious. The prices are pretty fair too, and the environment is a step above the usual. Great place to eat except it's always really busy."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend about an hour before closing. The service was rushed and was told not to order anything too complicated as everyone wants to go home. The food was mediocre at best and over priced.   Would I come back? No."}
{"text":"4.25/5  I really liked my visit to SongCook's, and I'm absolutely surprised by how it took me four Yelp years to finally pay a visit.   SongCook's is the epitome of authentic Korean cuisine. They have a section for people who want the traditional Korean dining experience (sitting on the floor with mats and a lower dining table), as well as a section for the conventional method of dining.   The service is incredibly friendly and attentive. Mind you, the space is very large and there were several dividers to provide semi-privacy to the diners, so I was surprised at how fast the servers were when we called for them.  Food-wise, nothing that BLEW me out of the water, but I would say it's tradition done right. I ordered:  Jajamian: black bean noodles 4/5 - good flavour and not overly (i use this word very carefully because it's still salty) salty - noodles were NOT soggy which is AWESOME since jajamian noodles tend to be mushy and gross  [I forgot]: Sweet and spicy chicken 4/5 - nice crunch - not overly spicy, be aware, spice lovers - sauce made the dish soggy after a while - only good when hot  Champong: spicy seafood noodle soup 4.5/5 - lots of fresh garlic added - good portions of seafood - mix of shrimp, squid, mussels  Gamjatang: pork bone soup 4.5/5 - rich flavour - a lot lighter on the peppercorn compared to other places (this is a matter of preference) - also very garlicky  I noticed they put a lot of freshly minced garlic in all their soup dishes. Nice touch for freshness and flavour :)  Side dishes were also very tasty! There was HUGE kimchi (use scissors ppl), bean sprouts, pickled radish (the opaque orange kind)  Overall, very happy with the dining experience!! See you soon SongCook''s."}
{"text":"You know that this SongCook's is a legit Korean restaurant because there are tons of Koreans eating here. I was on the lookout for a Korean restaurant in the area, one other location was closed on a Monday, and I was fortunate enough to find this location thanks to the Yelp app. The location was not that obvious because it's located away from Steeles, close to Galleria.  SongCooks looks inconspicuous from the outside. It's quite huge on the inside. I would not have guessed. The restaurant looks pretty fancy. I was here for lunch and there are a ton of $10 lunch specials. I ordered bibimbap in a stone bowl (dol sot bibimbap). You can also get a free soda by checking in with the Yelp app.  Like all Korean restaurants, I was served with banchan to start. It included bean sprouts, some other thing I've never seen before, and a huge plate of kimchi. The cabbage was huge. I didn't realize that's what the scissors were for. The dol sot was really good. I really enjoyed all of the ingredients that were included. I'm not a fan of crispy rice, so I tend to stir the rice around before I eat to ensure that it doesn't stick to the bowl.  Overall, a good dining experience. I wouldn't mind coming back for dinner."}
{"text":"It's a puzzle finding this restaurant but we found it!  My first time to eat in this restaurant.   It was a long wait this weekend. We waited over 25 minutes. It was worth. We ordered the set menu for 4 people that includes sashimi salmon salad, bbq ribs, sweet and sour pork riblets, black bean noodles, clam soup plus an order of their popular seafood Korean pancake and 4 big bowls of rice.  These for sure are authentic Korean food. So much selection but for anyone who's not sure what to order, we find the set menu as a good choice. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I like this place. It is a regular dinner place for me to go with my friends in the weekend. There is usually line up during the weekend. There were times that we were told the wait was 2 hours and we had to go to other restaurants.   What I like: The beef stew with the carrots and radish is good The slow cook pork ribs with aging kim chi The grilled fish The rice with dates and nuts (it usually takes 20 mins)  Please be aware they close early during weekday evenings."}
{"text":"Objectively speaking, this restaurant is good for the amount of money you pay. It's sectioned off conveniently for people to either sit on a heated platform with their family, or go out for a night of light drinking and dinner with friends. Either way, worth my while, and is a great place to spend New Year's Eve."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group of friends and had a wonderful experience. Instead of ordering meals for each of us, we opted to share everything! So I got the chance to sample a lot of dishes that I can't even name. Most of it was really good, and the prices are really affordable.  Unlike other Korean restaurants, they don't offer a large variety of banchan (appetizers)- only kimchi and pickled radish. However, I had a lot of food to indulge on that night, so I didn't really mind that much.  I honestly struggle to remember what I ate that day, but there were a couple of things that I absolutely loved. The jajangmyun was definitely a winner! I'm not normally a fan of black bean, but I loved the black bean sauce and I wanted to slather it over everything. The noodle also had a smooth and pleasant texture, and the combination is delicious. Another dish that I loved was some sort of stir fry pork in a spicy sauce (jeyuk bokeum?). The spicy sauce was addictive! It was not that spicy to me but probably sufficiently spicy for everyone else.  We also got a big pot of bibimbap to share, and that was also tasty. The Kam Ja Tang (pork bone soup) was alright, but nothing spectacular.   On a side note, half of the restaurant requires you to sit on the floor. It was not the most comfortable arrangement for most guys, although I was fine with it (because the floor was heated).  I also got free pop for signing in on Foursquare. So make sure you sign in if you get a chance."}
{"text":"Great service! I can't tell whether this place is truly \"authentic\" or not, but it has great food and a great atmosphere! (Other than the part where they had the baseball game going on a flat screen in the 'traditional' seating area haha!)  My friends ordered the spicy seafood champong and the chicken champong, and I ordered the yukgaejang. I tried their soups both and loved the rich broth, and was somewhat disappointed by mine, which had a slight onion taste and some shredded beef with lots of vegetables and egg. They also had insanely huge portions (and the price difference between my stew and the champong was only about $3 or $4).  Neither of my friends could finish their champong, so I would suggest splitting one between two people if you and a friend have smaller appetites. The chicken champong would have been really good had my friend not requested it to be extra spicy, but even with all the extra peppers floating about, the broth was so good with plain rice.   This place was pretty far from me, but it had been recommended to me before by a good friend and I'm so glad I finally had the chance to go! I loved sitting in the traditional seating area and loved seeing the chefs work behind the bar. Its a nice place to take a date or somewhere that's just a teensy bit more fancy than a place like Owl of Minerva."}
{"text":"Food is great! The staff are very pleasant and accommodating, and the service is quick! The noodle combos (near the back of the menu) are a great option if you want to try more than one thing, and the portions are quite generous for the price. Always love coming here even though it's a little far away, it's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I really loved it the waiters were the best and so welcoming, it was my first Korean food experience and let me tell you it was the best they catered to my liking and offered great meals love it definitely going back again soon."}
{"text":"Got the kimchi chigae and the toppoki. The soup was spicy and had a lot of tofu, but taste wise it was just average. The toppoki wasn't spicy enough and the rice cakes were not as chewy as other locations"}
{"text":"When I crave Korean food, this is the place we go. Its spacious, with comfortable seats, and most importantly, authentic and good Korean food! Came here on Saturday night around 8:30PM, and surprisingly it wasn't very busy. This place used to be so packed around dinner time on weekends. I learned one downside today, and that is they no longer offer the option to barbecue your own pork belly! (Tears) due to \"safety\" reasons they said. However we still ordered their delicious Kam Ja Tang, Kalbi short ribs, bibimbap, and seafood pancakes. Its rare to find places like these where they've been around for a while, and can still keep up with their quality every time you go. Great food, attentive service, and ample parking. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"As a Korean, I can say that this is one of the two best Korean places that I've ever been to in Ontario. There is a wide veriaty, and many of them are good, if not very good. Some of the dishes like the cold noodle (nyengmyeon) tastes better then most nyengmyeon restaurants in Korea."}
{"text":"Friendly staff greet you at the door.  Manager, Dale is always walking around meeting customers and making sure all is great.    Had the La beef ribs grilled, stewed beef ribs, traditional black bean noodles, chicken katsu, sweet n sour chicken, spicy soup noodles and omelette (pancake style).    Sat on the heated floor tables. Fast service for this type of menu. Kids enjoyed the food too."}
{"text":"There weren't a lot of customers at lunch time on a Wednesday. The servers were attentive but not overbearing. We had a couple questions about the menu and they were able to point us in the right direction.  The ginseng chicken soup was refreshing on a hot day. The small portion of the dumplings (mandu) had about 10 so keep that in mind when you're ordering. I love the sauces that come with the pork belly. I could almost just eat that on its own haha.   Don't forget to check in for a free pop."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night for the yelp international supper club. Thanks Kris!!! (And yelp)   5 stars. I loved this place. Great food, great company, great conversation.  I learned so much from Dale the owners son. I feel like I need to call ahead to make sure he is working so I can have him explain everything I'm eating and drinking to me!!!  Dude has a great voice too. Could listen to him for hours  Came here on a Thursday night for the yelp international supper club. Thanks Kris!!!    It's located driveway west of the Northwest corner of yonge and Steele's.  I came from the north and turned into the driveway to the Korean grocery store. I felt triumphant in avoiding the intersection! Yay. I know the area, if you don't, use a GPS. For real.  There's lots of parking all over but - being the super parking queen that I am - I parked at the door. Score.  It's in a plaza with other businesses.  At the back of the building.  Forgot to take a photo of the entrance. It reminds me of the nightclubs that you could find in the area in the 90s.  It might have been.  Decor: OK. No one told me we'd be sitting on the floor. Actually on raised platforms. Was fun, not so bad once I got used to it!  The place is really nice. All hardwood.  Clean lines, clean floors!  There are tables with chairs on the other side of the restaurant where we were sitting   Wait staff:   Everyone was so nice. Everyone!  We had Dale come to our table and explain everything. He answered every question we had, recommended wonderful dishes, and  helped us figure out how to serve and eat. Hint: scissors!!  Food: OMG. I need to here. Often. And bring everyone I know!  The menu has a lot of pictures. Only thing, you have to try and guess what the corresponding item is.  Ask lots of questions if you are in familiar with Korean food. Like I wrote earlier, everyone is so nice!  We ordered a few dishes. I'm not sure if we could have gotten anything that tasted better. Checking out what other yelppers ordered really helped. We hit all home runs. There was nothing I didn't like.   What we ordered:  KamjaTang Jungol - pork bone soup. We got a large bowl for the table to share.  They bring out a big burner for it to sit on and stay warm.  It was enough for the five of us at the table with a bit left over for take home.  It was spicy and warm with vegetables and pork ,(obviously).  I would come back just for this.   KhanPongeGi - sweet and sour chicken. For sure am getting this again. Like sweet and sour you get at a Chinese restaurant but better. The batter was crispy. Dale explained that they cool it before the fry it which helps it stay crispy.   This is a must get dish, one everyone will love.    SamKiupSal and vegetables 6 large pieces of thick cut pork belly cooked on a table griddle with onions and enochi mushrooms.  You wrap in green leaves and eat. Loved this.   This was our table favourite. Heck yeah bacon. Who doesn't like bacon. Yum.  Kaibi - beef short rib. This was really tasty. Nice marinade. Delicious dish. It was another table favourite.  JaJangMyum - noodles in a black bean sauce with beef. Was very tasty. Really long noodles, made fresh every day. You can tell.  Of all the dishes this was my least favourite. It might just be because of how it looked.  And rice. White and purple rice.   Thumbs up. I'm coming back. They have an app!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a family dinner over the weekend. This place is able to accommodate large parties and they also have floor seating for those who are inclined.  We ordered a variety of staple Korean dishes to share, such as pork bone soup, seafood pancake, jajangmyeon, and the like. The food quality was very average and nothing stood out among any of the items. The prices, however, were a lot higher than similar places in the area. This was made even more apparent when they ask you to order rice and ssäm lecture wraps on the side (these items are usually included for free with their respective dishes).  The banchan side dishes were disappointing as well, as they only only included kimchi, tofu, pickled radish, and bean sprout. The kimchi was unusually sour and tasted like it was soaked in vinegar. Probably the first time I've tried kimchi that was more sour than spicy.   Overall, I think there are better restaurants to get the same quality of food for more affordable prices (especially in nearby Koreatown). Definitely an overrated location Imo."}
