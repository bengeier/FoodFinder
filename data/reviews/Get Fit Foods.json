{"text":"Been hearing a lot about this place and wanting to start a healthier diet, I stopped by to check it out. Great selection and prices were very reasonable. Tried the ginger salmon, green beans and sweet potatoes tonight and it was very tasty. Also grabbed several others to try.  Thanks so much to Sasha who greeted me with a smile and filled me in on all I needed to know. Definitely will recommend to all my friends! Well done Get Fit!"}
{"text":"I've been referring my clients here, since they opened, to help out making life easier and healthier and finally decided I should probably give it a try. I just returned from vacation and didn't feel like shopping or making any food, so I came in and very easily picked out 5 meals. I got a variety of lunch and dinner sizes which included chicken and salmon. I am very impressed with the salmon and the bbq chicken tacos. The owner was there to answer questions and was very friendly and helpful. I can't wait to go back and try more meals. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to pick up a quick, healthy meal on the run. I especially like the spicy turkey chili. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. I picked up 4 meals for about $30."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty! But, the sales girl at the new Plaza Midwood location told me the Charlotte Agenda promo was better than the buy two get one free promo so I only selected two meals to try. When she rang me up, she didn't apply any discount and I didn't notice until I was home unpacking the meals."}
{"text":"This review is technically for the Park Rd location, but I can't find their yelp page and I assume the food is the exact same across locations. I was pleasantly surprised by how awesome the food is! I've tried a few different \"meal prep\" services around Charlotte and they all seem to either be good but high calorie, or low calorie and bland. The different size meals are perfect for my household since my husband is a weight lifter and probably eats 3x the amount of food I do. I try to eat a 1200 calorie diet 6 days a week and its been super easy to incorporate my GFF meals into my lunch and dinner routine. So far I've had the bbq beef with mac and cheese, the meatloaf, the steak, and the mixed berry chicken salad. The food isn't just \"meal prep\" good but actually delicious. I find myself even eating the GFF meals on my cheat day."}
