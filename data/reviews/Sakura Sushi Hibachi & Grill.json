{"text":"One of the most awkward sushi experiences! Only the all-you-can-eat menu was given to us at first so it made sense (fyi menu says we would pay for some foods not finished). We ordered light apps and were told rolls were 6 pieces. Apps came out in very small portions of salads (seaweed/squid), so then we ordered a few rolls- small but delicious! So we decided on a couple others and before we know it, here comes a forgotten app and 2 huge 10 PIECE rolls that we could not possibly finish! Great sushi but heres the kicker...we were asked immediately if its our first time, if we lived near, how we found them, THEN each question over again! We were told we would need to pay for what we didnt eat...we honestly felt like we were in trouble for not finishing our plates! They ended up not charging us for extra 2 rolls (we had NO PROBLEM with paying extra), but were reminded 3 TIMES that next time we would need to pay. No need to treat us so differently when we didnt finish...bummer i was hoping this would be a good experience :/"}
{"text":"We enjoyed this place very much.  Love the d√©cor of the interior.  Service and food was good. I have never been to a place with all you can eat sushi.  I made sure I just ordered only what I was capable of eating.    I do not like wasting food.  I fully agree with the food policy."}
{"text":"Cannot beat the  $12.95  AYCE lunch special. $6.95 for kids. Full appetizer, Nigiri, special rolls and kitchen items. Not bad at all!"}
{"text":"If sushi that tastes like carboard is on your menu then you've come to a perfect place. Just left this place and our stomachs are already hurting! We are pretty healthy people and specialize in good sushi. This didn't even make the edible list. When you order anything from the menu, it tastes so bad that you won't be eating sushi for a while. A long while. They use a lot of imitation crab meat in almost all of their sushi. Even when you think there is no imitation crab meat in your sushi they will sneak it in somehow and you will find it with great disappointment. Really reminded us of a recycling sushi factory, where they recycle their old ingredients. Feel me on this one, deep fried smoked salmon roll? Deep frying a smoked fish?? If you were on chopped kitchen you would definitely be eliminated right then and there! So come on in and feast on some shit."}
{"text":"I have been there multiple times for lunch and dinner and have always had a delicious experience. I usually get the all you can eat choice which is the best value I have ever seen for sushi. The fish is very fresh. The service has been very good as well. I only went once where it was slow and I think they were overwhelmed with the amount of people in the restaurant. I hope they continue to serve the Cornelius area and hope people find this wonderful little spot."}
{"text":"First of all, the food is good. However, I had the worst dining experience of my life here tonight. We purchased a Groupon worth $40 that we paid $22 for. We ordered the rolls which were 50% off. When the check came for about $75 we were told the coupon did not qualify. It was only good for the \"all you can eat lunch.\" The coupon didn't specify lunch nor not applicable on any specials like the 50% off rolls. My position is they have $22 of my money already and they wouldn't even take that off the meal. I already paid that! I will NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN. I will tell my friends not to also and I have many friends. At the least they could have taken $22 off the bill and they wouldn't do that. POOR AS HELL CUSTOMER SERVICE. They will not stay in business with that attitude. Bye bye Sakura."}
{"text":"Honestly, the best thing about this place is the all you can eat, but if you don't finish everything they will not hesitate to charge you extra. The actual food was sub par at best. The sushi was decent. Our waitress was not rude but very, very forward with us. How the menu worked was unclear and I thought you ordered sushi by the number of pieces you wanted instead of by the roll, so the waitress decided to throw some shade my way and be like, \"Oh, you want 16 rolls of sushi?!\" I was over here like, \"Um, excuse you. I may be whale sized and if I was spotted in the ocean I may be harpooned, but obviously I don't want 16 rolls of sushi.\" The teriyaki chicken was very low quality. It may have been teriyaki cat. I'm not really sure. Also, there were no spring rolls on the all you can eat menu which was very depressing, as spring rolls are my favorite item and a very common thing at Asian restaurants. I may go back if their prices lower or if one of my best friends is having a terrible day and begs me to go there with them. Cheers."}
{"text":"My family and I absolutely love this place!  The food is absolutely delicious and fresh.  We have been more than a handful of times and the service is always impeccable as well as the food. It really is a hidden gem and a must try."}
{"text":"One of the best Hibachi places around. The all-you-can-eat sushi for 12.95 is a GREAT deal. For the people complaining that they got charged extra for not finishing, it is in the policy at the top of the menu on EVERY page. I saw it right away when I opened the all you can eat menu. You should eat everything you order as well. Them charging extra makes sense to me. If they charged you 12.95 for ordering 10 rolls but only eating 2, doesn't make sense. All around, great restaurant and great ownership."}
{"text":"I went to the all you can eat lunch special. Firstly, you feel pressured because if you don't finish your food, they charge you an ungodly extra amount. Our waiter had this overwhelming attitude that made me feel unwelcome. The music makes me feel like I'm at a ethnic hookah bar. Honestly the teriyaki chicken had me convinced that I was eating teriyaki disgusting. Overall sushi is decent, but everything else made me want to run away."}
{"text":"Salads were made with limp lettuce. Sushi had an old fishy taste, which is a HUGE no-no with any sushi. Really wanted to love it, but didn't. Best part of the experience was the music playlist being played."}
{"text":"Avoid if you are looking for quality sushi.  Their deal was lots of rice and paper thin sushi.  Stale rice and sashimi was left over bits   Just go to a real place not Chinese joint masquerading."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our first dinner at Sakura last night. \"Andy\" greeted us and attended to our every need. We couldn't get over the fact that they had such an extensive all-you-can-eat sushi menu for only $19.95!! We ate a ton... the food was fresh and delicious - the entire experience was excellent!"}
{"text":"Have gone here a total of 3 times now.  First time for lunch was amazing.  Food is awesome, speedy, and delicious.  2nd time went for Dinner, food was just as amazing, however, it took about 10 minutes inbetween rolls.  It took an hour and a half just to order a few rolls for 2.  3rd time, went for lunch again, thinking dinner was just a fluke.  Food again was amazing, however, it was again another hour and a half lunch.  The food just takes too long to get.  We order about 2 rolls at a time, to avoid the charge of ordering too much food."}
{"text":"Actually, the food was outstanding.  The sushi is fresh with good flavor.  The teriyaki chicken and other dishes were good. Ok, you are wondering why the two stars.  The service.  The 'all you can eat' at a non-buffet restaurant is dependent on the server's attention to your table.  My server sure seemed to have plenty of time to spend with other tables and just ignore mine.  So, when it came time to enter another order, the filled-out paper laid on the table a long time.  So, my lunch hour went a lot longer than it should have.  In addition, she picked out my straw from one drink to another one with her bare hands.  How do I know what she has been handling? Will I return?  I don't know.  If I walk in and get the same server, I will turn around and leave - provided I even go back."}
{"text":"So happy I found this place! From the moment I walked in the door, I was greeted with a warm Asian welcome and a friendly smile, but that was just the start of good things to come. I ordered the Buffett all you can eat, but this buffet is not your average Buffett, it's Buffett to order off the menu and I took full advantage of that. I ordered a number of items starting with soft shell crab spider Maki, Avacado roll, sweet potato Maki, shrimp tempura maki,  American Dream Roll and Miso soup.    Not only did I leave full, I left very satisfied, not just with the food but with the entire experience. Hats off to the entire staff for being so friendly & nice and making sure my food came out fast and fresh.   Note to the owner: You've got a beautiful restaurant and I wish you much success!  Keep up the great job!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because $20 for dinner per person is expensive. Yes, it's well worth it if you eat your fair share, but $20 for dinner before tax and tip is still a lot.   The sushi is great. The rolls are loaded with fish and not a bunch of fillers or bogged down with rice. My go to is the fancy salmon and pink lady roll. They have a bunch of signature rolls, but they also have the typical \"spicy tuna, or salmon rolls\" for those that just want simple tuna.   The hibachi is decent and also are some other kitchen items. I like the shumai and the dumplings. The bang bang shrimp is good as well. Soup and salad is also available, but I quickly bypassed that and went right to the meat and fish. There are so many options, all that taste great.   You're not going to find a better deal than this in the Charlotte/lake Norman area, not to mention it tastes great. You need to reevaluate things if you're going to sushi at the lake across the street instead of this place! Ha!"}
{"text":"There's a very good selection on the all you can eat lunch menu... I've tried a couple of the appetizers, 3 of the entrees, and quite a few of the sushi items. It's all been great! I definitely recommend giving it a try..... I'll bet you'll be back!"}
{"text":"Sushi was mushy and tasteless. Same went for the bang bang shrimp. Only food I liked was the miso soup. Service was attentive but they kept getting really confused over simple things."}
{"text":"I would give less than one star but apparently that's not possible. Went here for the \"all you can eat\" lunch for 12.95. I ordered five rolls and finished about three and a half rolls. The rolls were ok. One of the rolls i didn't care for at all as it was full of fillers and very deep fried. I asked for my check and the server told me I had to finish my food. I of course thought he was joking. I told him I was full and didn't particularly care for one of the rolls. He told me that I had to pay 12 dollars for each roll I didn't finish. Again haha I thought he was joking. He finally brought me my bill which was for 28.95 and told me I was lucky because it should have been closer to 60 dollars. I've never heard of such nonsense but he assured me it was policy. They also threatened to call the police if I didn't pay. What an experience. Save your money and go somewhere decent."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the all-you-can-eat sushi many times, but won't be going back. My credit card number was stolen and fraudulent charges attempted the day after I used it there. The same thing happened to a close friend of mine. I have to wonder how many other people it's happened to.  I went back to the restaurant to inform them after it happened and was told the owner would call me, but a day has passed and haven't heard a word."}
{"text":"I eat here constantly for work lunches. I honestly dont know how they make money with all you can eat lunch for $13 and dinner menu $20 but ill be a forever customer! Everything they have is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  We were greeted by an awesome waiter, Freddy. They explained the menu and then the \"other menu\" which is $19.95 all you can eat. You cannot go wrong. Best sushi I've had in the area and all you can have for 20 bucks!  The food is top notch. Great service. So happy this opened so close to home.   Say hello to Freddy and I'll be here every week!  And the Sake selection is great to which makes me even happier!"}
{"text":"Great experience. We got the all you can eat sushi. I was stuffed after 1.5 rolls since they bring out the appetizers and rice first. I dont think bbn I got 20 dollars worth of food but the sushi was great. Service was fantastic. The sweet tea is sooo goid. We will be back"}
{"text":"Wonderful food! This is our new \"go to\" place for sushi.  The staff is warm and friendly ( good service!!!)  we've been here 5 times now and the food and service have been consecutively excellent.  I recommend this restaurant to all sushi lovers!!"}
{"text":"First time coming to this restaurant and I was pleasantly surprised. I am not a fan of sushi, although my boyfriend is, so I stuck to the hibachi. It was very tasty and didn't have that greasy, heavy feel to it. My boyfriend had the sushi and hibachi & he really enjoyed it. Prices are great too. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love that they have all you can eat but it's not buffet style. You order and they make it fresh in small quantities. So happy we found this place! Lunch is awesome but dinner is even better and has larger menu!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and a great price  So many choices- so try different things with your friends.  Lunch and dinner all you can eat.  So worth it  We had the rainbow, volcano, California dream, spicy tuna, salmon, seaweed salad. White tuna, squid, eel roll  Boston roll( little boring) great roll for a beginner  Miso soup- our Thai friend loved it  Lots of pickled ginger and wasabi"}
{"text":"Super surprised!  Found this restaurant through groupon. Read that it's buffet style ($13 lunch and $20 dinner) and was expecting a typical buffet with cold dried out food. To our surprise it's an all you can eat which you order from an excellent menu (expanded options at dinner). Everything is made to order!  We really enjoyed the cuc crab salad, the shrimp tempura (1= 1 shrimp), the shrimp dumplings, the 3 specialty rolls we ordered and the spicy tuna roll. The only thing we really didn't like were the spring rolls (greasy). Jessica was our server and she was great. Service was lightening fast too - I mean really crazy fast! Sorry sushi a the lake you are no longer our go to place. For two adults with 2 sodas (both kids are under 40\" so they eat free!!) our bill without the groupon was $31!!!!  Plus tip we ate unlimited sushi and apps for $37!!! Oh we will be back!"}
{"text":"We ate lunch here Sunday for lunch . Extremely friendly staff. Everyone was very nice and happy to see us. We decided to do the all you can eat for 12.95 . Which includes appetizers , soup, salad , Habachi , along with sushi , nori.a lot of options . Everything came out quickly and tasted fresh . Between my and my Wife we could only eat 4 sushi rolls and two orders of habachi and crab Rangoon's . Great job Sakura we will be back soon  for sure. Plate up was great and plates was clean you can tell that they care about there presentation and being a chef that is important to know they take the extra time to make their food look good and tase good."}
{"text":"Been here once. Server was very friendly and nice, she informed us about the all you can eat option and encouraged us to order as much as we wanted. Sushi was mediocre, I've had better and I've had worse. It also didn't take a long time to get food but there was also only two other couples in the restaurant. I liked that they didn't charge for extra things on the all you can eat such as Nigiri, sashimi or desserts as I've seen other places do this. I would go back if I was in the area but wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Fantastic all the way around. Andy, our server was great. Sushi was fresh and everything was clean. Highly recommend the sesame balls. The kids shared a Bento Box and it was a ton of food for them. Will be frequently visiting!"}
{"text":"Nice greeting when we walked in, but ended up sitting at the table with no drinks or any other acknowledgement from staff for a good 15 minutes. Once we were noticed service picked up a little but was still not very good. Both of our meals was good and prepared as ordered. Based on it saying a hibachi grill I was expecting to sit at a table and have the chef cook in front of us, that is not the case here. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today while my wife went to a play at the Blumenthal downtown.  This space has been numerous other restaurants over the years with different cuisines from Italian (twice), Greek, French, Indian and Chinese. Not a bad location so I don't know why restaurants have such a problem here. Granted that management is part of the equation but several of the previous restaurants had both good management and great food.  In any case, I like Sushi and decided to give it a try.  The first thing that strikes you when you walk in is the eclectic lighting, Dim lights and the accent colors are shades of magenta, blues and green, Reminds me of hour my room mate decorated our dorm room back in 1966. Not psychedelic  but getting close. Ourside of the lighting, the rest of the restaurant is tastefully decorated.  There is a notice as you walk in that is seeking to clarify the All You Can Eat Buffet to one with 50% off. Only good at certain times of the day and I left more confused than before I got there.  My server was very nice but I still did not understand the new or for that matter, the old procedure either.  From the $12.95 AYCE Lunch  Menu, I ordered a Rainbow Roll which is Crab, Avocado and Cucumber inside topped with Red Snapper, Tuna and Salmon. For the Sushi, I had Salmon, Shrimp and Red Snapper.  The presentation was nice and portions were ample and the quality of the meal was very good. After I finished my first tray, I was asked if I wanted more but I declined.  For my beverage I ordered Hot Tea and frankly, I expected something more that a cup of hot water with a tea bag in it.  Still confused about the menu but maybe I'll have if figured out the next time I visit."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi!?!  How can you go wrong?  Fresh and tasty.  Nice staff.  The place to go if you need to O.D. on sushi! So many choices, not just rolls, but nigiri and sashimi as well."}
{"text":"Great sushi.  Everything was fresh and distinctly flavored.  Service was friendly but a little slow.  The price was just right.  We enjoyed 3 rolls, 2 beers and one giant bowl of udon soup.  We spent around $40.  Best Udon soup I have had!  This is my new go to sushi joint."}
{"text":"My family loves coming here for the all-you-can-eat sushi. The hibachi is eh but everything on the sushi menu is fantastic. Items vary between the lunch and dinner menu slightly, but it's not a big deal. The shumai is fantastic! My husband and I gorge ourselves on it. The older waitress is wonderful, very sweet, and funny- always urging you to \"drink less, eat more\" when I get miso soup. Haha, love her. I would recommend this to any hungry sushi lover!"}
{"text":"People, be advised - THE FINISH YOUR PLATE, OR YOU WILL BE CHARGED clause is in at every sushi AYCE joint I have ever been too.   I think I have visited them in every major city and It is always the same.   Get over it, it is normal.  While the Yelp reviews were 4 and some 5 star, I rated my lunch experience a 3 star, mediocre sushi, nothing special, no big WOW - I gotta come back.   The sushi was fresh, but my rolls (see pics for proof) had way to much rice.  They tasted great, and for $12.99 - it is a great value - but I have seen much better.  Also, the sushi chef messed up my order and the wrong plate was dropped off on my table.   FYI - the people working there speak very little English.     So, in closing, not a bad value, but if you are really into Sushi, go somewhere else --- bring your teenagers here :-)"}
{"text":"It's a great \"all you can eat place\" much better than thevTypical buffet. But make sure you eat all your food or they will get mad at you and ask you to pay for it"}
{"text":"I've eaten here time and time again, and this place has yet to disappoint. They have THE best all you can eat sushi selection i've ever seen, and i've eaten every last piece on that menu. Places like Mr.Tokyo are cool, but they don't do Sashimi like Sakura does. I can't speak much for the hibachi menu, but if you like sushi, I suggest you come here and eat your heart out."}
{"text":"I had heard such great things about this place prior to my first visit. Maybe my expectations were too high. The sushi was delicious but I could not get my server to return so that I could order more of it. We were engulfed in conversation until someone in my party brought up that it had been thirty minutes since our waitress had been over to check on us. We had to ask another waitress for help. After that it was another thirty minutes before we got our second order. I don't think it takes that long to cook. Our first order came out promptly so it was weird that the second one took so long. I hope that is not the policy but the food was good enough to try it again and maybe we will get the right server."}
{"text":"You cannot beat this place. $19.95 for all-you-can-eat sushi ($12.95 during lunch hours!), and it includes all their specialty rolls. Usually, sushi places have a limited menu for half-price sushi during certain \"happy hour\" times, so it's great to have somewhere where everything is included, all the time, for one price, AND you can get as much as you want. Great sushi and great service."}
{"text":"Came for a late dinner. Sushi was awesome..as well as prices. I love the flat rate..all you can eat...as the mini portions of fried rice etc. The service was great and very friendly. Will Def go back."}
{"text":"My buddy and I met for lunch here and was really happy with the choice.  Of course we took full advantage of the AYCE lunch special.  I have to say that I was impressed with their selections.  I have been to other spots for AYCE and they are not as good.  The portions and ingredients to rice ratio were on point,    We focused on the Rainbow, Spicy Girl, EELl, Spicy Tuna, Spicy Yellowtail and Philly Rolls.   All were quite tasty and felt that we got good value.  I was going to try some of the non sushi items, by my eyes got the better of me.    Service was really good.  I tend to drink a lot during meals and the waiter never let me run out.    I plan to return as it is close, the food is good and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great price. And the waitress is hilarious- she tells you to drink less water and eat more food. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a slow Sunday night. We both agreed that the food was very good. We ordered apps, kitchen entrees and some sushi rolls and absolutely loved everything. However, the service was sooooooooo slow. Like insanely slow. Keep in mind there was only about 4 other tables occupied. So the food gets 5 stars, but service gets 1."}
{"text":"I had went to Davidson for a graduation and my cousin, the graduate, had recommended this place.  Honestly, I really wish they have something like this in Atlanta.  Yes, we have a lot of sushi restaurants and even sushi buffets such as Nori Nori, but I like how this AYCE is a sit down restaurant (like Iron Age) and you can select and place your order with it coming out fresh each time.  Love the selections for lunch, but the reason why I am giving it 4 stars is because they forgot my child's order and when it finally came out, it was sooo salty as if the chef just threw it together last minute.  They've also forgot a lot of our orders and messed up many dishes in which we let go.  I would give it 3 stars because of all the mess-ups, but being that the server, Lily, that we had was so sweet, I had bumped it up to 4 stars.  Would love to try it again, but for dinner.  However, since my cousin had already graduated from Davidson College, I no longer have a reason to go there."}
{"text":"Love the AYCE menu. Great price with good options. The staff has always been nice & fast on refills or getting your orders put in & to you. Definitely our go to for sushi."}
{"text":"My mom sister and I went here yesterday and it was awful. we did the 12.95 lunch special and ordered hibachi steak, which seemed like the meat was boiled. I tried the dumplings and they seemed like they were bought at food lion. The only thing semi good was the crab rangoons. The sushi had absolutely no flavor, 10/10 would not recommend"}
{"text":"We we're here 2 wks ago for dinner,  and it was pretty good.    Definitely will eat here again."}
{"text":"Tried Sakura tonight with my family. The decor was nice and the staff was friendly, so I had high hopes for the food. We ordered the chicken udon soup, hibachi chicken, chicken lo mein, and chicken fried rice. The portions were generous but the food was pretty flavorless. Sushi seemed to be pretty popular there (other tables were ordering strictly sushi) I should have taken that as my cue. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday to try the All You Can Eat Sushi special, we were surprised to find out that the all you can eat extended to other kitchen items and full entrees.  We decided to stick with sushi, my wife and I both had a specialty roll which was surprisingly large, the regular rolls were also a good size and had a good amount of fish in it.  We definitely got our moneys worth and were impressed with the quality for the price, this is the best all you can eat sushi we've found in the Lake Norman area.    The service was very friendly and made it a fun experience.  The sushi is made fresh to order so it can take a little bit to get your food but worth the wait for the freshness.    The all you can eat dinner menu had even more options than the lunch, we'll be back to check that out at some point."}
{"text":"Great quality for the price! I have been twice to the AYCE dinner. Fish has always been fresh and good. There is a little extra rice on the specialty rolls but that's ok. My favorite roll is the Catawba. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Always satisfied . The all you can eat sushi is great.  Staff is polite and quick. One of my favorites in Cornelius"}
{"text":"Just came here for my birthday today, and honey everything was MARVELOUS!! I'm so happy I chose this place. The ambience is great, our server was so so sweet, and the food was so good!!! I've never been to a better sushi/hibachi spot!"}
{"text":"All you can eat is a great deal. Food was fresh and wait staff is helpful.  Only complaint is I asked for a hot water with lemon and he brought it to me in a regular glass not a mug. It was kind of funny."}
{"text":"All You Can Eat Sushi?!? $14?!? Sign. Me. Up.  My wife and I have been eating at Sakura since week 1 of their opening.  When I first heard of AYCE sushi, I was thinking buffet.  And while I will throw down at a buffet, sushi sitting on a tray doesn't sound great to me.  HOWEVER...  Fresh, made to order, sushi is bomb. Fresh, made to order, all you can eat sushi... is even more bomb.    I get rolls for days when I go here and I thoroughly enjoy them.  I save this place for special occasions these days.  My favorite roll to get is the Spicy Girl... The fish eggs, the seaweed and the spicy mayo make this roll just amazing. So many textures and flavors and an incredible heat bring a full on rager in my mouth.  The staff are always amazing and ready to help... Don't order too much sushi and not be able to eat it as you will get charge for any rolls/pieces that you waste.  I will say the rolls have gotten a little smaller than when they first opened.  But I honestly have to say that it hasn't cut down on the quality of the rolls.  If you want more fish... order a bunch of nigiri.  I usually kill about 6 rolls and 5 pieces of nigiri, along with a seaweed salad.  I have gone for dinner and they do have some different rolls and options to make the menu more high end but my favorite options are on the lunch menu.  There are a few mixed reviews on here but I strongly encourage you to try it out for yourself.  I have never had a problem that wasn't quickly fixed with good communication to the servers."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and food was very good. Will definitely return. Great value for the choice of food being offered. Everything was made fresh for us as we ordered. One of the best places I've had sushi since moving here."}
{"text":"I gotta say this is a good little find.  You have to go in with the proper expectations but if you do it is TOTALLY worth it.  Have done all-you-can-eat lunch and dinner and have been pleased both times.  Staff is friendly and attentive and the food is good.  The menu has a couple of quirky items on it like the tempura kani, calamari and the bang-bang shrimp.  They are not very good in my opinion but that's about all I care to say on that.  The nigiri is good quality (hamachi, maguro, tamago, sake, kani, unagi and I am sure a few more) were presented  well and tasted fresh.  The rolls (spicy girl, salmon skin, spicy salmon, spicy tuna, sunshine) are all very good.  Love the tempura shrimp and also the jalepeno hamachi appetizer.  The interior is well-appointed and comfortable.  Overall this is a good little restaurant.  I will return soon..."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Their ordering is set up strangely and they don't stick around long enough to explain how it works. We had to locate our own chop sticks and I had to chase someone down for a fork for my mother. From what I understand, it is suppose to be all you can eat and you choose from three lists but the portions are tiny, as if for a child and of course, you have to keep putting in order after order of tiny portions until you're full. They are called small plates. The food was bland and they even brought the wrong soup. To top all this off, they have written \"no sharing\" on their menus and tell you that they will charge you extra if you haven't eaten all your food by the end of the meal. I think they should rename this place to \"Asian food, preschool style.\" I have no interest in eating here again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with my family and friends and the service has always been pretty terrible, but I return because the sushi is good and it's decently priced, but tonight was actually so bad that my family and friends and I will not be returning. Our server was extremely rude, which my friends and I tried to look over even though they dropped sushi on my friend and did not replace the roll. It was one of my friends birthday and we asked to get their usual birthday thing which is free so we could sing to her. Our server didn't even acknowledge that until we said something way after we had paid the bill. the server proceeded to say \"Is it really your birthday?\" To  our friend and we said yes astonished that he even said that. He said he would ask whoever in the back and comes back to tell us that they needed to see an ID from her!!! SO RUDE!! She is young she doesn't have an ID!! (We know they don't usually ask for an id bc a table near us got it without one). It was extremely rude and the fact that they treated us like that just because we were younger (18-25). I even left a tip because I felt bad for the server!! Never again will we be returning."}
{"text":"All u can eat sushi for 19.95$ for dinner everyday is super amazing!  Best deal in Charlotte I have come by yet. They have awesome drink specials all days of the week ranging from half off bottles of wine to excellent beer specials. The staff is beyond friendly and will take good care of all your needs. Come here....grab some sake and eat away! So come here grab some sake and eat away so so good!"}
{"text":"I actually was a bit worried with one or two of the reviews but it was really good. the value is great and you get to try a whole bunch of new things. Loved the udon. I wish the shumi and the wantons were not fried but steamed but they were still good. We also asked for a plain tuna roll and they were happy to get it for us. The only thing I did not like is the you have to eat it if you order it. I think the rule is a good one but if you dont like somethign like the tornado roll we ordered because it was to doughy, I really wish I did not have to finish it. They say if you dont finish it you will be billed for it. But all in all the best thing was the bill , about half of what it woudl ave cost me. We did the lunch and cant wait to try the dinner. Was not keen on the guy who kept walking through, at least stop and say hello if you are going to Marshall the  place. The waitresses were so very nice. give it a try"}
{"text":"My mom is Japanese and we have been to Japan many times!  Anyone who knows great sushi, knows it must be sliced thin!!  Sakura knows this!!!  Sushi was perfectly sliced, so fresh and delicious!!!  We have been regulars of Eeze, which we very much like; however, there is no comparison to Sakura when it comes to sushi!!  The entrees and service were so great too!! I'm not kidding!!  AND, every night is all you can eat for $19.99--entrees and everything--ALL you can eat price!!  Came out with a much lower bill than other places that don't hold a candle to Sakura!  Trust us, we don't mind paying if the food and service is good--even if on the pricier side.  But $19.99 for what we experienced this evening??!!  Felt like we should have been charged more.  We were soooo pleasantly surprised!!!  Great ambiance, the bar stools at the sushi bar are adjustable (which is great for 5'4\" me and 6'7\" husband!), the plates besides sushi are like Japanese tapas size, so the all you can eat deal is very easy!!  Tonight (Wednesday) was half price wine bottles and I believe Mondays are half priced wine by the glass!  Good wine list and great beer selection!  We had absolutely no complaints!!  We went in skeptical, came out wanting to come back for more!!!  No kidding!!!  Must try!!!!!!  You won't be disappointed!!"}

{"text":"We came for AYCE lunch. I'm from Las Vegas, where we have AYCE all over the place. I'm a little bit of a sushi enthusiast, and the deal at Sakura for lunch is just great.   Our server was great - she was sweet and attentive. She always came by to take our orders and fill the water. The restaurant was nicely decorated and it was not too busy.   So why the 3 stars? The fish was just okay. The rolls were fine, but there just wasn't a huge selection. We got the yakisoba from the entree selection and it tasted so much like soy sauce.   I think we will come back for the lunch menu again, maybe after a few months to let more reviews to come in!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Sunday night with my boyfriend and it was pretty empty - there were really only 3 or 4 other tables occupied - so we didn't have to wait very long for our food.   They have an all you can eat menu that has a lot of options and at $19.95 per person it's a pretty good deal. At least for me and my boyfriend it is because we put away sushi and dumplings like it's our job - so we normally spend at least $40 anyways.   The shumai and the gyoza were both tasty; came out piping hot and while they are of the fried variety they aren't overly greasy. All the specialty rolls we ordered were pretty tasty too, I'd highly recommend the amazing roll, green devil roll, and the spicy girl roll.   I also ordered some nigiri. While the salmon and tuna were okay, both the tamago and the eel left something to be desired. Also, a lot of their specialty rolls involve shrimp (like 80% of them) so if you're not a huge shrimp sushi fan it's a little disappointing.   Overall I would probably go back, but maybe for the lunch AYCE deal for $7 less."}
{"text":"Joe was really cool and they have great fish here. We got multiple rolls, sashimi, and lo mein, appetizers. All was REALLY good. Fish tasted fresh. White tuna is awesome and finished it off with mango mochi. Not only was Joe awesome with his sushi chefness, but good convo. Definitely will be back."}
