{"text":"Walking distance from my house so we will come here as a convenience to watch the game outside on the patio with a couple of cocktails. It gets pretty busy at night and swap sweat walking through the crowds...ew."}
{"text":"One of our favorite hot spots. We really love the fish and chips. They are always well prepared and the fish is just right. We always have a to go box. The last time we dine there about a couple of weeks ago on a Monday night, our waitress was out to lunch. She was cool but just not attentive as we are used to. She took forever to bring us our to go boxes and to bring us the check. Oh and the cheesecake was very delicious!"}
{"text":"Kennedy's is a pretty solid little sports bar. It has a nice Irish theme about it and pretty comfortable seating. They also have a really big front patio which is pretty fun to hang out on at night.  The beer selection is pretty good but a little sub-par to the selections of some other bars in that area. They do have some nice mixed drink though. In ways of foods that are vegan friendly there, it's pretty much fries or hummus. They have a black bean burger, however it contains egg if I remember properly.  Kennedy's is one of those places you would go with friends to watch sports games. They have some really nice TVs and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and I am trying to find something positive to say about our meal, the service, the atmosphere...Ok, the atmosphere was ok, esp for a bar and grill and I was not disappointed with that as much as everything else. Overpriced, mediocre food, inattentive service. Don't waste time or money going here, unless you don't care. I hate it when this happens!!"}
{"text":"Bad service with worse food.  It's hard to screw up simple chips & queso and a hamburger, but somehow they managed to do it.  There must be a curse with the location, because apparently nothing can stay in business there; fingers crossed Kennedy's experiences the same fate and something better comes next."}
{"text":"First of all, by law, gift certificates cannot expire (that's why Groupon type things must always honor the amount paid). I went in with an expired gift certificate that the server asked the manager about and they declined it.   The service was mediocre too. I asked for water with no ice, but of course, got ice. The server had already started walking away as I was still asking for water. Her friendliness was totally fake.   The food was okay, not great, definitely not worth returning again. I wish they would tear this place down instead of the old P Stone and Jacks"}
{"text":"I love love the Chef Salad. It was actually more than one person could eat in one setting. The presentation was Great. The wings were awesome as well. Try it you will definitely like it."}
{"text":"Absolute disaster of a place.  Please anybody can put a neon shamrock in the window and claim it's an Irish Pub.  This place makes Bennigans look authentic.  Please have your barstaff learn how to pour a proper pint. All these other positive reviews are either written by the owner/owners or staff.  I think you can get better food at George Papas lanes.  No Joke!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Good food, strong drinks and a super friendly staff.  I love going out and sitting on their patio.  They also have a ton of tv's, so you can watch almost any game that you're interested in.  If you ever have a problem with an order, the staff will fix it right away.  Trivia nights are awesome as well as their bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary's/  I can't wait to go back for Cinco de Drinko :)"}
{"text":"They had me at $5 Irish car bombs. They even have $5 Jameson whiskey shot specials.   The atmosphere is fun at night and relaxing during the evening. The deck is a great place to have a beer and watch the game, especially in the spring or early fall when they have the fire pit going.  The food is above pAr and blows other bar foods out of the water. Fried goat cheese burger, the panther burger and hot wings are fantastic. As far as wings go, one of the best in The city."}
{"text":"When I walked in last night my first interaction was with a waitress who needed me to \"get out of the way\" as soon as I came through the door, not a huge deal, but it stinks to get spoken to like that when you are going to give a business your money. What really bothered me was the bartender who ignored me the whole night, withheld my card as I tried to check out and accused me of drinking more than was accounted for on my tab in front of a huge crowd. Nice place. Bad service. Won't be back."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I went to Kennedy's last Friday for happy hour. The weather was great and the patio there is perfect for enjoying a few drinks. They also had someone playing the guitar in the corner. It is by far the best patio in the neighborhood. We found our new favorite after work spot!"}
{"text":"Barely mediocre bar food.  Our beers were warm and the food was blah and greasy.  I've had better food from a fast food joint and at half the price.  Not worthy of a return."}
{"text":"Great deck- okay food, TERRIBLE service. I was just there last night- perfect night to enjoy the outdoor deck! What could have been a great night turned into such a frustrating ordeal because of the service which made me remember why I stopped going last year. I don't know whether they are consistently understaffed or whether they intend to hire the slowest people on the planet. I didn't feel as though it was outrageously busy- I've certainly seen it a heck of a lot busier than it was. Getting a drink was a monumental task, getting our waitress's attention required little less than tap dancing on the table to show tunes- and when we were finally able to flag her down we usually got the \"just a minute\" finger with a look warning us that clearly she's very busy and we should really be more appreciative of her time. I was starving so I order crab cake sliders. Why? Apparently I like throwing my money away- that's why. They arrived just as I was trying to flag the waitress down (again) to cancel my order. They were okay- the bread was pretty stale but the crab cakes themselves weren't bad. Silverware would have really made my dining experience better (as I wasn't eating the stale bread). I was done with most of them when the waitress finally appeared again I got my check and had her wait when she finally returned with it so we could give her our cards. Then we went to P Stone- which is where we should have gone in the first place. Excellent service- great patio, much better food- I won't be returning to Kennedy's again unless I have no choice."}
{"text":"The outdoor bar is fun. Fans keep you cool. Trivia night dragged on too long. The food is not good. Bland and cold. Eat somewhere else first."}
{"text":"The first thing you see upon arrival is a spacious, dog friendly patio, complete with heaters for those colder months.  Inside has plenty of seating, bar, table, and booth.  There is a small but well rounded beer selection, and keeping with the Irish theme, a large selection of whiskys.  On the down side service can be a bit slow even on the less busy nights, and the food is good but not great.   Overall a good place to grab a drink and even get a snack.  As a side note, there is Music Trivia on Tuesdays, and General Knowledge Trivia Wednesdays, both at 8:30, either of which are worth the trip."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken tacos! Taco Tuesday, you have the pleasure of getting fish, veggie, chicken, or beef tacos for $1 each!   The drinks were a little pricey, but oh my goodness were they delicious. I had the Chantilly Lace and a Charlotte Martini. Fruity but balanced. I've had awful drinks in different bars that either tasted like cough medicine or Kool-Aid. Not here buddy.  Parking might be a bit tricky, but it was rainy and after 9 when I showed up. Our hostess was great. I'll be back for Crableg Mondays:)"}
{"text":"If your looking to lose weight, don't get the trash plate. OMG! this thing is soooooooooooo bad for you as it is soooooooooo good that you can't stop until it is either all gone or your gut explodes. LOL We will definitely be back after we get done at Weight Watchers.  ;-)"}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio...the praise ends there.   Terrible service ruined my evening with a group of friends. Seriously, slowest service ever and they didn't seem to give s**t. It wasn't busy and it seemed as though the staff were working against one another. Weird concept. I've been there more than once and this is my first bad experience, however, my friends have warned me that the service is brutal.   Sorry I'm not sorry."}
{"text":"I was wanting some crab legs and Kennedy's was about the only place in Charlotte that I could find that had an all-you-can-eat crab legs, except for the Chinese buffets, which I don't trust their food anyway.   The atmosphere is very casual and fun.   I arrived right at 5 pm which is when the AYCE crab legs starts.   They were a little bit slow waiting on me for my drink, but once they started bringing out food, they were super good at keeping my plate full of crab legs.   The salad was not worth having, it was just an iceberg salad out of a bag with some dressing.   I liked the drawn butter and then the buffalo sauce was a unique twist.   I preferred the butter, but dipped a few pieces of crab meat in the buffalo sauce and it was good too.  Overall, it was a great experience and I plan on going back."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place one star because we found not 1, but 2 hairs in our food. The first one was fried into the batter of our fried pickles. The second was stuck to a side of french fries.   The waitress was great at getting us another app out very quickly. (even though the chips were stale that came with the queso for the replacement app). She also let us know that we didn't have to pay for the food due to the food issues, but the saddest part of the whole experience is that not one manager or supervisor came to our table to apologize. If I owned/managed a restaurant and I knew this happened to one of my customers, I would have been the 1st person going to that table to apologize."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to the historic Elizabeth area of Charlotte to Kennedy's Premium Bar & Grill. This pub is tucked into a neighborhood friendly area that boasts many family restaurants and has a huge outside deck. Dora here. Wish the sky hadn't been so overcast because I would've enjoyed sitting outside on the gorgeous deck.   We started with the Pretzel Bites appetizer served with Queso and Dijon mustard dipping sauces. Dipping in the Queso took the pretzel bites from OK to good. The server warned us that the Dijon mustard was spicy and she was right. Dora here. Phew! Have a tissue handy. The mustard sauce will clear out your sinuses, but I liked it! I was expecting these little nuggets to taste chewy and soft, but instead they were a bit crispy.  I chose the Shepherd's Pie with Guinness gravy, layers of beef, mushrooms, carrots, celery, and onions topped with mashed potatoes along with a side of tater tots. The meat was tender and the vegetables cooked so that they still had a crunch. The mashed potatoes were creamy and the tater tots outstanding. My biggest issue with this dish was that it was only lukewarm, causing the flavors not to mix well.   My wife had the Fish & Chips, deep fried Haddock, battered with Harp lager, an Irish beer. Dora here. Since Kennedy's is a pub, I had high hopes for this dish. The fish was lightly battered, flakey and tender. The sweet potato fries were a bit lackluster, and the slaw was just average. Nothing  really tantalized my taste buds. And the iced tea? A total loss. Bummer. But then I'm quite sure people don't frequent this establishment for the iced tea. :)  I would rate this restaurant 3 forks out of 5 forks for a family friendly restaurant serving good food. Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & #Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great specials, and bingo on a Wednesday night - can't ask for more! I would definitely recommend getting the blackened chicken salad!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times on different days and at different times. The best time to go is on a weekday after the lunch rush. Outside seating is nice. They have fans blowing if it's a warm day outside. The service is always pretty good and the wait staff is friendly. The food is typical bar food and nothing really special stands out. It's a fun place to hang out with friends if you're around elizabeth and wanna grab a beer outside on the patio!"}
{"text":"Coming from Rochester, NY, I had read online somewhere that on Friday nights, Kennedy's offers a Chicken French entree (a Rochester \"specialty\").  So, we went on a Friday night and, unfortunately, they didn't have it.  I asked our server about it and she said that they only have it on some Friday nights.  Sigh...   I'm not going to fault Kennedy's for that, though.  But I would recommend that they offer it regularly!  :-)  They did have some other Rochester area specialties, like their Garbage/Trash Plate.  Other than those items, their menu was pretty extensive.  It was your typical bar food menu and then some.  There are a GREAT deal of choices.  Even their salad options were lengthy.  I had a tough time deciding what to get.  I eventually went with the Fish & Chips (it was Friday night, after all!).  They did a fantastic job with the traditional Fish & Chips.  Both the battered fried fish and fries were delicious, especially with lots and lots of provided malt vinegar, and washed down with a $2 PBR.  The big old house that Kennedy's sits in has been through many incarnations in the past few years, and we've yet to visit any of them until now, but we're hoping Kennedy's sticks around awhile.  The atmosphere was pretty cool.  I'm looking forward to sitting outside when it's warmer out (even their outdoor heaters probably wouldn't be warm enough for me).    The parking at the house is VERY limited and tight, though.  The restaurant wasn't super-crowded when we arrived and we already couldn't find a place to park.  We had to park up the street in someone else's parking lot and walk (Shhhh...)."}
{"text":"This place should be called White Trash Pub matt called me a nigger and than laughed at my face I tried to resolve this but when I call all I get is that racist piece of shit Matt, this place sucks cause of that guy wish I could give 5 stars down"}
{"text":"This is a solid Irish joint with a comfortable atmosphere for those who like to relax and have a few brews. Authentic Irish pub food is served fresh and delicious, and the half off burger wednesday is the best deal (and burgers) in Charlotte. The patio gets plenty of sun and is also dog friendly, a huge plus in my book.  Whenever friends come to town, this is the pub I bring them too. The staff is friendly, the service is good, and the beer selection offers domestic as well as local on tap. Guinness lovers will savor the rightly served brew and the $5 Irish bombs are a treat. You don't have to be on the emerald isle to enjoy a little shamrock fun. Kennedy's is a great spot that is perfect for sporting events, family gatherings and just downright good times."}
{"text":"Go for the drinking atmosphere, not the food!  Great neighborhood drinking spot. Big porch with many TV's and corn hole.  I don't think I've been inside with the exception of using the restroom.  Wednesday night Trivia at 8 pm is always a good time. Great beer specials (all draughts $3) and burgers are half priced, though, I don't think they are that great.  Parking is usually a pain, but you can get away with parking across the street.  Again, this is a fun place to grab a drink with friends, but I wouldn't expect a delicious meal."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from Kennedy's, so I've been here often.  They have a great patio and I like the inside as well.  It's an old house turned into a bar, so there's all these little nooks to hangout out in.  I'm on the email list and they've got some good specials throughout the week.  During football season last year they had $30 AYCD beer and AYCE wings.  Oh HELL YA!  Other than that, the food is pretty average, decent bar grub.  Service can be hit or miss from my experiences."}
{"text":"So impressed with what they have done to this place...stoped in late with some out of town guests on a Sunday night the place was dead but to be expected on a Sunday and after a big holiday.  Either way we really had a good time the bartender Michelle was very friendly and welcoming.  Can't wait to come back and try the food."}
{"text":"All you can eat crab legs with hush puppies and a salad oh my. Cute place, outdoor area is cool and the service is awesome."}
{"text":"Ok, since I've already written a review for Kennedy's a few years ago, I'm gonna give you the low-down on this place from the start.  This is absolutely BEST PLACE TO WATCH A BOXING MATCH in the Charlotte area bar none!  First, there is no cover charge at the door.  There is plenty of seating both inside and outside on their expansive patio area, and the typical bar food is always great tasting and very affordable.  Being a native of #Rochester NY, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that they offer a #Garbageplate - the only place where you can get such a dish anywhere in the Charlotte area.    The only and I mean only, negative I can think of when it comes to Kennedy's is that parking can be very tight especially on Friday and Saturday nights.    Otherwise, Kennedy's has everything us Western New Yorkers need to feel right at home here in the Queen City!"}
{"text":"Ok first,  let me start by saying it was the \"soft opening\" so I guess they still have a few kinks to work out.  Nothing was too different between this place and the other bars/restaurants that have been in this building.  It was pretty busy, so the fact that the bartenders were ignoring people/serving others first was annoying but fine.  I asked the bartender how much it was for a pint of Bells two hearted, she told me $2.50, then charged me $4 on my tab.  We sat upstairs at a table, it wasn't too crowded up there.  When we sat, a server came up to the group and told us she would get us whatever drinks we wanted, but she never came back for as long as we were up there (two hours).  We had to go downstairs because the upstairs didn't have draft beer.  Another thing is that they had one unisex bathroom upstairs that was out of order, and only two stalls in the downstairs bathroom, and there was water everywhere.  Anyways, it just opened so I'm sure these things will improve, they did do a great job with the playlist."}
{"text":"Monday nights!  I'm a crab leg fanatic and those crab legs are INCREDIBLE!  I'm going to be a regular soon."}
{"text":"If all you can eat crab legs doesn't make you try them, then their new patio and willingness to accept large groups will.  Monday night, I was expecting dinner with my immediate family, but was surprised by a group of friends to join. 90% of us ordered the crablegs (which are awesome and hot). Kennedy's was offering a short menu for dinner. Overall I was pleased by their willingness to sit us before our entire party arrived, even giving us options(indoors, outside, or upstairs). Staff seemed friendly enough and were prompt with requests.  FYI:It's walking distance from all the cool places in plaza midwood area. Parking is limited.  Sometimes they offer live bands. They offer free games to kill time if you have to wait.  Dress casual and expect a good time."}
{"text":"I only come here on Monday's for the all you can eat crab legs. It's the best deal in town. I nix the salad because that just takes up room for more crab. And I eat a few hushpuppies, which are quite delicious. But if you can't tell, salad and hushpuppies come with the crab legs. The crab legs are delicious, they're steamed  in some delicious garlicky seasoning and they give you a generous portion. If you're interested in partaking in the Monday night crab feast, come early, I think they start serving at 4:30pm. Parking is extremely tight so be prepared to park in the neighborhood and walk. Don't park in the shopping center across the street, they I'll boot or tow your car."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time and sat on the outside patio. Loved that is was pet friendly for my little puppy. We really only had drinks, nachos, and burgers. Our food was good. Service was pretty slow, however."}
{"text":"I have been to Kennedy's at least four times now and have very much become a fan for a few reasons.  First, the food is reliable and enjoyable.  Traditional bar food with several Irish dishes and some vegetarian options.  I've shared the nachos, had the Hawaiian salad and the Black Bean burger.  All nice sized and sufficient.  Not a lot of parking, but off-street is fine.  They are EXTREMELY dog-friendly which is awesome.  They've brought a water bowl and treats both times I've taken mine.  Kennedy's also does a lot of coupons (Groupon, Livingsocial, Half-Off Depot, etc.) and are very friendly about patrons using them.  Once a group tried to use four (though it clearly states one per table), but since there were 8 people they offered to honor two, which I thought was pretty cool.  Dependable spot for sports watching, too."}
{"text":"I have had a few bad experiences here. The food isn't good and the service staff could use some very basic training. It took our server over 35 mins to figure out our checks because he didn't write anything down for our group of 6. I would only return for drinks and the outside bar."}
{"text":"My husband enjoyed the all you can eat crab legs and my club sandwich was divine! I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I've lived less than half a mile from Kennedy's the entire time they have been open so I'm not sure why it took until a few months ago for me to appreciate the amazing-ness that is their deck. Covered in heaters and flat screens plus dog friendly? What is not to love. The food isn't anything super special but is solid. I can't wait to experience the deck in all its light covered glory in the summer. But it sure is a toasty place to grab a beer with friends in the winter."}
{"text":"I was a little wary of the reviews, but after eating here I feel the quality is higher than some of the other reviewers feel, at least in my opinion. Their parking lot is small, but it was easy enough to find somewhere close to park on 7th St. Located inside a large two floor house, it has a warm and comfortable atmosphere. The tables are spread far enough apart to fit a large group, and I like the plethora of TVs to watch any team that's playing. The staff is friendly, the drinks are cold, and the food is flavorful. I enjoyed the calamari, not too chewy with a perfect amount of breading.  The shepherd's pie is meaty and rich, and the grits are creamy. I had a great meal and a great time."}
{"text":"I was hoping that Kennedy's had upped its game in the three year hiatus from my last visit. Unfortunately, things have gotten worse. The restaurant is in walking distance, but I've avoided it since I got charged double for a double drink.   Seeing that they had a Taco Tuesday, we decided to give them another shot. While the food was definitely cheap, it was also of poor quality. I couldn't tell the difference in taste between the chicken, beef and fish tacos. The $0.50 extra for guac and sour cream was squirt of each (a la Taco Bell) into a plastic ramekin.   The service was lackluster and the place smelled like they used the same wash bucket to clean the restrooms and the main part of the restaurant. Unfortunately, I have no plans to return."}
{"text":"Patio- check. Beer- check. Bar food- check. Browns football- check. Sounds like a perfect place to me, but God help the Cleveland brownies. I swear every year is our rebuilding year. The reason why I bring the Browns up is because Kennedy's is Charlotte's Browns backers bar!!!! I might be a little bias, but overall Kennedy's is a great spot.   Like many restaurants in the Elizabeth area, Kennedy's  appears to look like an old restored home. I love it's charm. The service sometimes is washy, but they have good happy hour specials (half off apps 4-7). Plus their taco Tuesday ($1) are surprising really good! Overall the food is bar food so don't expect a 5 star meal, but you can never go wrong with fried pickles anywhere! Plus there wings are pretty good and they are half off during happy hour too. I recommend the barbalo sauce!"}
{"text":"I called and called...no response!!....very indicative of the I do not give a fuck attitude.....I heart the eventual food but the employees remain a snooty unattentive air...I have been many times bc the food isssss good..but customer service and server knowledge is a joke!!!..Grrrr!!"}
{"text":"Very cool bar/restaurant in historic area of Charlotte. Food was great! Live artist singing Saturday night.  In old historic home with great patio. There were no kids there on Saturday night.  Nice hang out for atmosphere and food!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Kennedy's for years - and have been experiencing a steady decline in food and service for the past year or so.    Most recently, my partner and I stopped by Kennedy's on a Wednesday evening for dinner and a few drinks.  We were seated on the patio - there were maybe 4 other tables with people at them.  It took about 10 minutes for our waitress to finally approach us - and then we had a long wait between placing beer orders and actually receiving the drinks.  It wasn't busy, she knew we were there - I have no explanation for why were sitting there so long.   Unfortunately, this level of service continued throughout the dinner.  For food, we both ordered salads.  My salad came out with the wrong dressing and the chicken not prepared the way I asked.  The server who dropped off our food did just that - dropped it off and left.  We waited for a few minutes for our server to check in, but ultimately I went inside to get new dressing from the bar and ate the chicken as it was sent out.    I wish I could say this experience was an anomaly, but I've had similar experiences here before.  I like coming here with a group for drinks on the patio, but I don't hold high expectations for it anymore."}
{"text":"It's not my favorite Restaurant for Irish Cuisine but it's still very good and the bar scene can not be beat.  We were in the area today and stopped shortly after 11:00 for an early lunch. Being early, we pretty much had our choice of seating. Most of the seating is Bar Seating on stools but there are a couple of regular booths over on the side. We choose a booth.  My wife almost had a fit when we walked in because she is from Pittsburgh and this is a Browns Bar. I reminded her that Killington's in Huntersville is also a Browns Bar and she relented and went in and in the end, had a great time.  Our server was very good and we did not want for anything. She took our drink orders quickly and gave us enough time to make up our mind on a very extensive menu.  She ordered the 7th Street Steak Sandwich with Mac-n-Cheese as her side. I had Shepard's Pie with Tater Tots as my side.  She enjoyed her Sandwich and proclaimed it to be one of the best she had had. My Shepard Pie was good although I am a traditionalist and prefer lamb. Plenty of beef however and a good savory taste with ample portions.  Another couple who came in later and sat on the porch had a yellow lab puppy with them and being animal lovers, it was a nice touch  and added to what was already a nice  atmosphere.  We have to go back down in a couple of weeks and this will definitely be on the table as a dining option."}
{"text":"This is a favorite place to go for Sunday Funday.  This place always seems to be crowded, but not over crowded.  I have never eaten here, only had drinks with friends so I am dying to try the food.  I heard the wings were good while we were there."}
{"text":"I love the area in Elizabeth right across from Philiosopher's Stone.  The food was pretty great and I love outdoor seating where I can people watch from up high.  Trivia night was the best I have done since Wild Wing and the staff were friendly and sweet.  I even got a free shot from the JIm Beam sales rep! What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"A bunch of us girls went to Kennedy's for their Monday night All-you-can-eat Crab legs for $19.99. Combine this with $3 pint night and it made for a great girls night. The crab legs were great and the hush puppies that came with were pretty tasty as well. Our server was very attentive and extremely friendly and very responsive to our needs. The manager & owner came to our table to get feedback on the crab legs since it was their first night serving them. Our only recommendation was corn on the cob instead of salad as a side. They said it was already in the plans for next week. They were very friendly and offered great customer service. He even reminded one of the girls about the discount if she \"checked in.\" we will definitely be going back for more crab leg Mondays!"}
{"text":"We went here for an alumni function upstairs and it seemed like a good joint. The upstairs was just big enough for a little gathering. Unfortunately my goal for my time here was just to get my moneys worth with the $20 unlimited Bud Light and wings for 2 hours, so my recollection of the details of this place gets hazy when you throw in those shots. However, it seemed like a cool place. Bartenders were friendly. The wings were good but weren't anything special, although i remember some people really enjoying the Parmesan something wings .  Tough to say if i'll be back when there are a few other places in the area i'd like to try, but i did enjoy my night and wouldn't be opposed to the idea."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good Irish Pub with a huge patio, Kennedy's is your place! It's huge, with a downstairs, upstairs, and partially covered patio. On Monday nights it's all you can eat crab legs for $24.95, which I've heard gets pretty hectic. They started a piano player on Saturday nights, which seems fun. It's alot different then the usual Charlotte scene, and with all the room it's a great place to bring a whole group. There are TVs all over the place, alot of beers (domestic and international) on tap and bottle, a large menu, and heaters outside. I had the Chicken Parm Sandwich, which had a mozzarella stick on top of it. Talk about decadent bar food!  They have great specials everyday of the week. Definitely will be a good repeat offender bar! Parking is a little tricky, but there are some local businesses that are closed on weekends/at night, so you can park there."}
{"text":"I've dined at Kennedy's a few times and every time it's been a great experience.  Great food, friendly faces, and a great atmosphere.  I definitely recommend stopping in for a drink, or even planning a private party here.  The VIP room upstairs is perfect for gatherings.  5 stars all around."}
{"text":"Kennedy's is a fun spot!  I have only really gone to drink, they have some great specials and a fun patio.  The food is typical bar food..nothing to write home about.  Sports fans, they have flat screens everywhere, all over the patio as well.  A fun place to go out with friends on a sat night as well as a fun place to day drink on the patio!  I'm a fan"}
{"text":"The waitress was so nice and made our experience a 3 instead of a 2 star rating. #1 There's no kids menu, our waitress knew the 2-3 things from memory but it was inconvenient to not have pricing or options before ordering. #2 We had the fried cheese, chicken fingers, and fish sandwich. Bar food. Nothing bad to say, but nothing good either. #3 I love the patio and atmosphere. All in all it was just an \"A-OK\" kind of dinner and I don't think I'll be back here for the food."}
{"text":"I have to say this is my NEW fav!!!  Kennedy's Premium Bar & Grill is the newest addition to the historic Elizabeth area of Charlotte.  Great new deck with mini fire pits, lots of seating, and nice wide screen TV's inside AND out!  I think it just might be one of the better places to hang outside on a pretty day around Charlotte or when you're interested in catching a sporting event out and about!  Not a bad seat in the house that I could tell for TV access!  How's the food?  We had the Fried Goat Cheese Salad, which was a bit bland for my liking, but the Fish and Chips were scrumptious!  And there were a lot of other items that I look forward to checking out soon.  After eating we moved inside for trivia night (which we proceeded to win by the way!).  Really like the coziness of Kennedy's!  It just feels good.  Think I'll be going back this week...."}
{"text":"The food was great with the exception of the tomato bisque it was horrible.  The bad is the parking.  I would visit again just to have the Bad A@@ Blue Cheese burger."}
{"text":"This is another of the 7th St. bars that are just comfortable an relaxed. Kennedy's has one of the best front decks in Charlotte as it allows you to spread out and relax and people watch. There are lots of fun nooks inside the bar with an adequate upstairs. I have personally not eaten here but my friends have had a few sorted items and always seem pleased."}
{"text":"Have been there several times for drinks. Patio is awesome. Bartender outside (have dealt with 2-3 different ladies) are fantastic. Very friendly, courteous and attentive. TV's abundant, heaters are perfect on cooler nights, I believe one of THE best patios in uptown area.  On the 4-5 times I have been there, their bottled beer is never cold. Last night I even asked the bartender to please grab a cold one. She even said she grabbed the ones from the back of the cooler. They still were not cold? Not sure but they may need to change or check the temperature in those coolers. This isn't the first time this has been the case. She was sweet and apologetic, so that helped things, but there is absolutely nothing worse at a bar than not getting a cold beer. Ironically, I sat next to a bartender I recognized from La Paz at Metropolitan. I remember mentioning to him, when at his restaurant, how cold & refreshing their bottled beers are. He explained they make a conscious effort to keep their coolers at a certain temperature. Kennedy's needs to do the same! My wife and I ordered food (this was the first time in all of our visits) and, the food was terrible. I am sorry to say that because I like this place, but it was terrible. I figured an Irish-themed restaurant would have a good fish sandwich. I was so, so wrong. It was a frozen piece of fish (geez, it even was those terrible triangle frozen fish pieces) on a bun! And the fries , well, some weren't even cooked fully. I was very disappointed that an Irish restaurant would serve a fish sandwich of that poor quality. Very disappointing. I will probably still go back  because of the location, the outdoor patio and the friendliness of the staff (especially the bartenders on the patio). I will hope for a much colder beer and just won't order food. Sorry Kennedy's, I wanted it to be better, but I am just being honest!"}
{"text":"First off the only reason I am even giving 2 stars is the food was decent. Otherwise everything else from the second we walked in the door was a zero if possible.  We made reservations with the owner on Friday for a table of 5 for Saturday evening. Got to the place, no record at all of the reservation. Hostess explains the owner text messages her the lists and he was off and had not done that. Ok, we got a table anyways after being quite annoyed that our reservation was never really taken. Our waitress eventually made her way over to our table to take our drink orders, 2 beers, and a mixed drink and some waters. The alcohol took a good 15-20 min to arrive, no biggie they were busy. At that point we placed our app and meals orders.20+ min later our app arrived and we made another drink order. Half way through the app that took forever to show up our meals were plopped down in front of us with no sight of our waitress anywhere. About another 20 min goes by no one comes by to check if our food came out ok, and we still had not gotten our drink order, that we placed when our app arrived. We had to track down another waitress, who took our drink orders, again. And apologized for our waitress. All of a sudden Summer was at our table, with our drinks asking how everything is?? Seriously? My 11 year year old sister had downed an entire 15oz rib-eye by the time she ever came back to the table.  We were all done eating, had no beverages throughout our entire meal and she never even apologized to us. Just acting as nothing had happened then tried to overcompensate at the end when she realized she had messed up.  Overall again food was decent, nothing I couldn't get somewhere else while not being treated like absolute crap.  Will never return, but maybe it was a bad night, with a bad server, but with no apologies or acknowledgement of screwing up at all, they messed up their chance with me."}
{"text":"Kennedy's is a great place to grab some food and watch a game or hang out with friends.  The outdoor seating is nice and everything I've eaten there has been good.     I especially like the buffalo chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"My husband and I were lured in by the great patio! Unfortunately that's all that I have nice to say about this place..THE SERVICE WAS SUBPAR! Very slow and our food order was incorrect. The servers were to busy playing with a patrons dogs while serving food..GROSS! We will never come back. The food was just ok...nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Had a great date there in the sunroom. Actually ate a salad- and it was good! The drinks are reasonably priced. Went back again and there was trivia night"}
{"text":"sat on the front patio.  great neighborhood!  great view!  we had a large lunch party, so they had to put a couple tables together.  it was quite hot and our tables had no umbrellas.  while i was fine, people in my party were noticeably too hot.  if i were the server, i would've moved several umbrellas over from the unoccupied tables, but she didn't think of that.  there were only 2 soups of the day and the server couldn't even remember both.    when i got up to go the bathroom - no t.p. in my stall!!!!  i had to drip dry on my lunch hour.  disgust!  we were there on our lunch hour and it took from 11:45 - 1:25 to get out.  that was asking for my bill asap and got change at the table b/c i was almost late for my afternoon client.  took way too long to get food!!!!!  almost an hour, i think.    food was o.k."}
{"text":"This is a nice easy-going spot for a Friday night!  They have little fire pits outside on their spacious deck, or you can sit inside at one of the many hightops.  They always have good beer specials and a wide variety of people (which I love!!!)  Not all babies and not all old farts or cougars, just a good mix.  Pretty good music too, popular stuff but also some old school favorites.  There is an upstairs in case it gets too crowded downstairs, huge big screen tvs everywhere.  I havent eaten here but I want to try that next!  Great spot!"}
{"text":"Great time! Food was delicious. I had the Fried Goat Cheese burger and my hubby had the Hawaiian Salad (it's new). Fried Pickles were fried to perfection!! We ate out on the deck and enjoyed the atmosphere. Service is good. Our waitress was helpful and cordial. A fun and relaxing night... Great people watching! ;). What bar isn't? We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent, perfectly cooked wings!  I attended a private party in the upstairs section of the restaurant (a very beautiful old house). We had our own (full) bar and server, and received excellent service.  Usually the top is open to the public and there is also a separate restroom. Our server Danielle was great ... My order came out wrong-I ordered 10 CALYPSO wings and my boyfriend ordered 10 hot. I only received 6 of my order, the rest were hot. Danielle had 5 more wings brought out (all drummets) to make up for it! Highly recommend the calypso flavor, it's their twist on the Caribbean. A blend of spicy and sweet, the calypso is sure to please! Great for groups or just a night out, only minutes away from the heart of uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"That Browns bar! Man if you are fan then this is the only place for you on Sunday - unless you play Fantasy Football and then you are screwed ... all TVs on the Browns. All Browns, all the time! I dig t though. I can appreciate the spirit. And lets be honest, Browns fans are so much fun. And boy can they drink - whats that you say? $5 irish car bombs all the time. Ok I've challenged myself more than once with the car bomb only rule. DO NOT DO THIS! Trust me - your tomorrow with thank me. It's a great idea in theory though. They also have a great selection of beers on tap, highlighting local brews of course. And the whiskey.... yeah they aren't running out any time soon.   Surprisingly the food is pretty good. I mean its bar food... but is good. The fried mozzarella squares appear not to be frozen and the dipping sauce doesn't come from a can or jar. STOP! People are making bar food from scratch? Fancy! The salads are pretty good.   So the idea is to go to Kennedy's on Monday - all you can eat crab legs. So good! Never over cooked and they steam the legs with some magical ol' bay something or other. The legs come with garlic butter and some hot sauce wonderfulness which you can never have enough of BUT I always give mine away because the crab legs are so sweet and tender tasting that it would be a shame to mask the flavor. Sad news though, The price is about to go up again to $29.99 - bummer. Still an outstanding deal in my opinion. Stilling on the big patio with a big group of friends; cracking crabs and drinking beer, laughing and getting all messy from this labor intensive food. Thats how we do Monday's Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The place of my people! Great service- Michaela was super attentive! As a business traveler, it's always a little weird eating out for one. Great group of staff members- they gave me the insight on some of the local brews on tap, and let me try a couple!  Food portions are MASSIVE! Got the Kennedy Club- it was great, but they used the crappy Kraft style cheese. It was cold/not melted. Go with a better kind of cheese and heat it up a bit! Would have taken the meal to a whole new level! Other than that, great atmosphere- they have a patio for warmer weather, too! Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Lazy sunday style spot IMO.  I really like this place....I really dislike the lack of parking but oh well.  Once you've found a spot to park prepare for a grand time and if the weather is right there's no better spot than there on the front deck watching the game.  I was hear last Sunday and with $5 Guiness and one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had I was a happy camper.  The service was very attentive and we had people that were showing up to join us later and the staff was more than helpful joining tables and keeping all the ordering organized.  As far as the burger itself, it was so good.  It's easy to dry out turkey meat but this was juicy and the sweet potatoe fries were a perfect side to go with it.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Kennedy's is a very nice neighborhood sports bar. I am particularly happy with the service. I have never been to Kennedy's without being welcomed by every staff person. I love that they invest in live music. Food is normal bar food but well prepared."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today 6/20/12. It took the waiter  3 minutes to come and give me an  Menu. After she brought out the drinks, it took her another 10 to take our order... Keep in mind I'm on lunch. After bringing out the food... She didn't offer to fill up our cups, neither did came back to check on us. She returned with the bill and didn't notice our totally empty glasses... I had to ask for more water...food was good, love the fries. Waiters need to get it together."}
{"text":"Daughter and I popped in to watch some Saturday football and have lunch. Plenty of tv's and large covered and open deck. My first time there. I generally judge places like this with their Reuben Sandwich which I ordered and my daughter ordered chicken fingers with Mac and Cheese. The corned beef on the sandwich was more like jerky which I'd recommend staying away from in the future.  The Mac and Cheese had a distinctive herb flavor which we could not pinpoint. We asked the server what it was and when she returned from the kitchen, we were told the cook wouldn't tell her. Interesting, maybe there wasn't suppose to be an herb flavor in it - who knows, it was ok, but nothing to get excited about or to keep the recipe a secret.  Our visit was disappointing, but sure others have found better selections than we did as the crowd was brisk enough."}
{"text":"We went there to meet a group of people but got there early to grab a bite and watch some basketball. They have several TVS and were great about changing it to the game we wanted.   The staff was extremely friendly and we received great service through out our time there. My boyfriend was drinking beer & when there was 1/4 left, he was always asked if he wanted another. I was drinking water & diet coke and both were constantly full. Upon ordering we received app plates, silverware roll & extra napkins. Seriously, you just couldn't ask for anything more from these bartenders.   They had a great selection of beer on tap and were offering upgrades from a pint to 22 oz draft for only $2 more. They had other great drink specials as well.   The food on the other hand, left more to be desired. We ordered the sampler platter which was okay. Mozzarella sticks, and sliders were what you would expected. The garlic Parmesan wings were the best part. The loaded tater  tots were a disappointment. The tots fell apart and were more like loaded hash browns than tots.  I'll definitely be back & maybe try some different food they have."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice on a game night and it's a good place to be with a group of your friends.  However, the service was horrible.  The staff was slow and confused.  The staff incorrectly gave my credit card (used to hold my table) to another table to close out, discovered the mistake, found my card, then gave it back to me ensuring that it was not charged.  Unfortunately, that was not the case and I am still trying to dispute the charge several months after the incident.  I'm afraid to ever go back here again, but if I do, I won't be using my credit cards."}
{"text":"I am giving Kennedy's an extra star, mostly based on an event they hosted for us.  The management and wait staff was so wonderful, it made the whole experience there better.  One of our student organizations was trying to find somewhere to host a social event.  We were originally going to hold it at the uptown location these owners have (can't remember the name off hand).  That located already had their private room booked, and so they suggested the semi-private area at Kennedy's.  They offered us a great deal from their catering menu plus 10% off anything we ordered off the regular menu for our group of about 15 people.  The semi-private area really isn't separate from the rest of the space, but it's a small, somewhat enclosed group of tables.  It was a week night, so it ended up being perfect for the occasion.  We had plenty of space to get up, walk around, and socialize with all the people attending.  They also had some great drink specials that night, which helped us poor college students stay within a reasonable budget.  The service was really wonderful, and everyone there was so accommodating.  Our food was even better than I had remembered.  My only real complaint is the parking situation.  Their lot is SO small, and it is really difficult to navigate.  Even on a weeknight, there was little parking around there.  Still, everything else was just great."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it won't be my last. I had a side Caesar salad with a side shrimp add onto my salad for lunch and it was well worth the price! Under $10.00! The Bartender was personable and friendly I'm pretty sure her name was Taylor. Great place!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch and was totally satisfied. The Reuben was one of the best I've had in town!"}
{"text":"This place has hospitality issues. Our hostess had an attitude and took an hour at the bar to get a table when the patio was empty on a Monday evening. After that she says\" just so u know that we are out of crab legs, but we were out when u came in. But I will assume you knew\". WTF. We went to this place just for crab legs. If she knew we would have not waited at bar for an hour anyways. Btw the waitress was good and she helped recovery"}
{"text":"Lemon pepper wings were the best I've had in Charlotte so far.  I enjoyed the Cleveland Browns Backers event.  I am a huge Browns fans and having a Sunday afternoon football meet was awesome.  Only reason I didn't do 5 stars is the fact that smoking is allowed on the patio, as long as they are not under the tent but the smoke travels and the smokers smoke on both sides of the tent so let's just call the patio,  the smokers Hutt. Yuck...  Outside of that,  the mozzarella cheese sticks were yummy and the servers are so very nice!!"}
{"text":"**Review for Taco Tuesdays**  When people ask me where to go for Taco Tuesday, I always recommend Kennedy's. They are usually skeptical but don't take my word for it- go! The tacos are delicious and they have drink specials as well. Tacos are $1 (or were the last time I went last fall).   I've taken my massive dog here to sit out on the patio and the service for both human and pup has been phenomenal. Now, I've also known others who have gone and had slow service but that personally hasn't happened to me. Perhaps I eat earlier than normal? I usually go before 6:30 p.m.   I love the outdoor area when the weather is nice. In fact, I've seen the inside but don't think I've ever eaten inside. That's how much I love hanging outside Kennedy's! I highly recommend this spot for an out of the box location for Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Great place to go and grab a beer, especially when you can sit outside! nice selection of food to choose from but is still sub par bar food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite patios in Charlotte. It may try and pose as an Irish pub, but this place is just a good ole neighborhood bar.   This is going to sound odd, but this is a great spot for taco Tuesday. They do $1 street tacos (chicken, veggie, beef, and fish) for dine in only. No they're not authentic or fancy, but they're just some cheap and yummy tacos. The day of the week I end up here the most is Mondays. I am a huge fan of their all you can eat crab leg night. It's $29.99 and comes with a salad (basically lettuce in a bowl) and hush puppies. They do get pretty busy on crab leg night, so get there sooner rather than later. It's a pretty solid start the week when you can get down on some crab while enjoying a nice night on the patio.  Wednesday is trivia and 1/2 price burgers. They have TVs on the patio. If you come here on Sundays for football, just be aware that they are a Cleveland Browns bar. I'm sure they'll welcome you with open arms if you are not a fan. What's the saying? Misery loves company? Poor Cleveland sports fans.   The parking lot is kind of small. I'm not sure of the current rules with neighboring parking lots. Currently, the old Philosopher's Stone is empty, so I've been parking there. I would just be sure to ask the hostess or manager on duty when you get there to make sure you're parked in a safe place."}
{"text":"Went to Kennedy's this past Monday for ayce crablegs as I do about twice a month. I was shocked to see the price went up from $29.99 to $35 as much as I love my crablegs I will not be returning, I would rather go to tin tin and pay $30 for ayce crablegs and chinese. It's sad bc I have been a loyal customer since back when they were  $24.95 in 2014. I hope they have a change of heart but I know if they continue to sell then the price won't change."}
{"text":"We used to regularly go to Kennedy's, mostly to see a couple of nice bartenders before heading to Jack's. These two, Justin and the bubbly one with curly brown hair (sorry, I cannot remember her name), are very nice, thorough, and always remember our names/drinks. However, god forbid that you ever have a server other than these two at Kennedy's.   There's been at least four different occasions where I or my friends have been given the wrong check, corrected the check, and then charged for the first check with an entirely different order. The waitresses can't seem to get it together there."}
{"text":"The positives:  Really good food, great setting not too far from downtown.    The negatives:  Parking is nonexistent.  Even if you allow for the downtown location, it was almost impossible to find a space.  I had to park in a nearby neighborhood that was a five-minute walk away."}
{"text":"Went there today and it was wonderful.  The food was great, atmosphere awesome and ambiance  excellent."}
{"text":"This place was just perfect. The waitress Chelsea was superb and was extremely attentive. The manager Matt came and greeted us as we were first timers and the food was awesome. The jerk flavor was mouth watering and the lemon pepper kept you salivating for more. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"It's an Irish pub. If you are a yuppie coming here for fine dining you will be disappointed. They always have deals and specials even on the weekends. I enjoy getting out of uptown (where I live) every now and then and I love going to this spot..decent food and great drink specials...no loud music so easy to have a conversation. That's all I look for in an irish pub."}
{"text":"Great service. Guitar player was a lot of fun. Seevice was quick and orders came out correct. Need more beer selection but whiskey options were great."}
{"text":"First time checking this place out, and was not disappointed by their food. The place itself is definitely a bar atmosphere and I would assume this place gets pretty packed on a nice day in Charlotte due to their large patio area!    The hubs and I stopped in for brunch on Sunday after church, and it was pretty dead in there at the time. Our server was also the bartender and she was quite nice. They had $4 mules as well as bloody and mimosa specials. Their brunch menu sounded great, but I was craving a Ruben, so I'll definitely have to come back and try some brunch. Their Ruben was tasty, nothing overly impressive or exciting, and I would have liked a little more meat, but it was good none the less. My husband got the erin go Braugh burger and it was cooked perfectly! He also asked for the egg to be cooked well, and it was. We both got their tater tots and they were delicious! Crispy on the outside and perfectly done on the inside.   Definitely a place to check out in Charlotte if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Yoooooooo....Turn around and go with your original plan for dinner! This place was has become such a disappointment. Not sure it's because they've become more popular on Monday nights or what, but this place was so whack tonight! The waitress was terrible and acted as if everything asked of her was irritating. The crab legs were skimpy and the salad was iceberg and the lettuce was super brown in the salads that came with the crab dinner. But then my husband ordered a side salad and wings and they came out with a beautiful spring mix salad. So my mother and I asked for the same salad and showed them the brown salad, and wouldn't you know it they charged us for the better salad. Once again the irritable waitress didn't have any answers as to how to resolve the small surcharge and she didn't offer to get the manager to get the manager or dissolve the charge. So needless to say, I won't be back! Customer Service is everything to me and this place is seriously lacking!!!!!! Two thumbs down"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for Mondays all you can eat crab legs. My two friends purchased the crabs legs and I got the grilled chicken pita sandwich. All the food was really good. The prices are a little high for me but I would go back again."}
{"text":"If this review was based solely on the outdoor patio it would get a 4.5 star rating but it's not, there is food involved. The location, across the street from Philosopher's Stone and 1/2 block from Jackalope Jack's, is prime real estate in the Elizabeth neighborhood. Add the outdoor patio/deck with plenty of lights, seating and a fantastic misting machine and you have a recipe for a great local gathering spot. The problem is the food. It's, as others have said, just bar food. I ordered the Reuben on rye with fries. The Reuben was just ok. The corned beef was not very tender. One bite and half the meat came out. It had ok flavor. I've had much better Reuben's at other establishments. The fries were over saturated in oil. I only had a few. Now the beer, the beer was cold and refreshing. This really is a cool place to meet up with friends for DRINKS (and it was packed for a Wednesday night)! Hang out on the patio and enjoy the views!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place on Super Sunday.  They were pretty slow but I would imagine its because everyone was waiting to go out for the game. Their food was average.  I ordered the wings and they were everything I expected them to be.  My friend ordered the buffalo chicken dip and it was good.  Amazing specials! They have AYCE crab on Mondays and $1 taco Tuesday. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with Kennedy's. It was just another neighborhood Irish bar. The building itself was pretty awesome and from what little I gathered has a pretty cool, ancient history. I usually don't hang out in this area of town. I neither liked nor disliked this place... just another one to ignore.  Service was friendly and the guy behind the bar (owner/manager?) gave us a history of the place. We were part of a progressive food/bar crawl and this was one of the stops we made.  We had a SAMPLE of their Sheppard's Pie... it was kinda bland but overall decent enough. I had a sample of Gusiness and a full pint of Snow Day.  Parking kinda sucks.  Not much else to write."}
{"text":"Kennedys is trying to keep the 7th street neighborhood bar scene alive. It's doing quite well for just the bar aspect. Now since P. Stone is closed this is the best patio in the area to enjoy a drink on a nice evening with friends. There are bars located both inside and out for convenience. There is table seating both inside and out (probably more outside). At night the patio looks wonderful with tons of people and the lights strewn about.   The food is typical bar food.. It has some Irish themed entrees but I wouldn't say that they have traditional Irish food. Monday and Tuesdays are the best days to head here as their specials are all you can eat crab legs and 1$ tacos. Any other day (specifically Wednesday) I would go for their burgers with sweet potato fries.   I'm glad Kennedys is still rockin after many years and hope they can improve the neighborhood scene there in Elizabeth.   PARKING - They have a small lot but the lot that is kitty corner to them allows Kennedys parking at certain times. Read the signs, obey the rules and you won't get towed! Simple!"}
{"text":"I go often to Kennedy's for their drinks but not for their food.  A group of my friends and I tend to hit up the mimosas special on Sunday's which is delicious.  I have ordered food a couple of times, and every time is wasn't that great.  It's beyond bar food.  This past time I found a piece of paper in my burrito.  Before, my friend has gotten old and brown celery and lettuce.  Nothing seems fresh.  HOWEVER, like I said before, the drinks are great and the atmosphere is good for sporting events."}
{"text":"This is a pretty great place. The food is pretty good. I mean for a bar, it's above average. The people that work there are really nice. I'm trying to think about how to describe it... Ok so you ever see a really pretty girl and just expect that she's going shit on your day and then you meet her and she's actually really nice??? They have a lot of girls like that. The out door patio is nice too. There is no damn parking but that's just how the area is. Hope this helps :)"}
{"text":"I am going to state the obvious and say that the parking is dicey.  But, my driveway causes my friends to scream in horror as they back into the big tree or run all over my neighbor's yard, so I can't be too critical. Our server was sweet.  Bless her heart, though.  I asked for a Sauvignon Blanc, and she brought me a glass of red wine and said, \"here is your Sauvignon Blanc\" (I think that it was a Malbec).  The beautiful thing was after I placed my order, I regretted not ordering a red wine.  Telekinesis, perhaps?  Then, bless my heart.  I happily drank that red wine and then, I drank one more.   My man ordered the fish tacos, which he described as \"ok.\"  My portabello mushroom sandwich?  He should have ordered that.  It was served on this soft, squishy bun, complete with roasted red bell peppers and some kind of special sauce reminiscent of Thousand Island dressing.  And the accompanying fries?  Served up nice and hot.  A sprinkle of salt, and I was happily munching away. So, I definitely like this place.  Good food and a server with mind reading abilities.  Kennedy's, I am glad that you are close by."}
{"text":"Been there for lunch on a few weekends. A nice place for some bar food in a casual atmosphere.  Usually get the burger or chicken sandwich. The bun is great (a little different than the usual) and the sandwiches are always solid. They are not skimpy on the fries - which I like. Service is usually first rate.  Sometimes the TV sound is a bit overwhelming inside. Parking can be difficult, but there are nearby lots hidden behind some of the other places on 7th St.   If you see a Groupon for the place. Buy it and try it."}
{"text":"I've never actually eaten AT the restaurant, but I have had delivery a bunch. The food has always been pretty solid. They do have garbage plates on their menu which is huge as I'm from Rochester NY and that is the supreme hangover cure and offered nowhere else around!!"}
{"text":"The cursed space on 7th Street.  Over the years this has been more restaurants/bars than I can ever humanly remember (Eden, Ed's, blah blah and blah).  One reason is probably the crappy parking arrangement (or more correctly, the total lack of parking).  If you are lucky you can park in the lot behind the house, which have a few \"premium spaces.\"  Otherwise you will just have to make do across the street next to Starbucks/Dollar General (though I never know if they will actually enforce towing).   Forget parking at Showmars, since they now have built a giant wood panel fence so you can't walk through... booo  Somehow I always end up being here on a Friday night, which is normally a low key night for me.  This place has the prettiest patio thanks to the perfectly hung lights above the entire decking area (and as observed, with zero burnt out bulb).  I can probably do without the giant shamrock but hey, it's irishly romantic.  They have 3, 4 flat screen tvs for game watching outside.  On a perfect weather night (like last night), it was simply amazing to catch up with friends while downing a cheap cold beer ($2 PBR bottle... keep the cap so you can play a hand of poker... I am not lying... next time look at a PBR bottle cap).    We actually ate there last night.  Food wasn't impressive.  Tomato Bisque was actually way better than anything else.  I have the beef sandwich (aka french dip) and it was ok.  The skewer appetizer was not that appetizing.  I do have to say our waitress was good.  She kept the drinks coming and never was away for too long and she actually appeared to not mind working there lol    I hope Kennedy's makes it... it's nice to just bounce around in my own neighborhood without the uptown madness."}
{"text":"I dined at Kennedy's last Tuesday night with a friend, and it was outstanding.    We were seated right away.  Our waitress was upbeat, friendly, and a pleasure to meet.  Everyone else we saw there seemed to be happy to be at work, with great attitudes and smiles on their faces.  The decor is so sharp... you will love it.... with fireplace, tvs, hardwood floors, brick, etc.  It is looks great inside, and you can hear your party speak!  They have outdoor seating as well.    The food was very good and made to order.   The bar looked very inviting, but I didn't have any drinks.  However, my friend did, and she enjoyed it very much!  I highly recommend Kennedy's.  You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This place has one of the best outdoor patio spots in Charlotte. During the spring or summer, this is where you want to be to quench your thirst for music and libations!"}
{"text":"This place is tops when it comes to the patio saturated bar scene that is 7th street.  $2 PBR's and $5 Car bombs every day?!  Yes please!  The service is friendly and prompt - and easy on the eyes.  The food I'd say is above average bar food but you aren't going to be impressing anyone on a first date (unless she's the kind of girl that loves $2 PBR's and $5 Car bombs, my kind of lady!)  They typically will have live music on the weekends and I believe through the week too.  Dog friendly on the patio so bring the pooch!  Looking forward to trying their $19.99 all you can eat crab legs on Monday nights...review to follow."}
{"text":"Just had food and drinks at Kennedy's and for a bar with an Irish Pub flair, it succeeds.  The checker boards inlaid on the table was a nice touch. Our server Marghy was attentive and extremely cordial. She also had a strong resemblance to Jenny Dell (my favorite Red Sox reporter) so she had that going for her :)  Guinness was served at proper temperature and the wing sauce was extremely tasty. We tried the hot garlic and the BBQ which both had a tang and zing. We inquired about how the blackened Parmesean sauce was made and Marghy was knowledgeable about it's ingredients. As a bartender, food and drink knowledge is important to me, and her food knowledge was excellent.  After the wings myself and two friends had the burger, Reuben and fish and chips respectively.  My friends really likes the fish and chips and the burger. The mashed potato side was large and tasty.  My Reuben was fine. As a NY deli guy, I am picky so it's hard for me to rave about sandwiches. I will say the fries were subpar. Not that they were prepared wrong, they just lacked flavor IMO.   All in all for a first experience, I had a very good time. I am looking forward to come back next week for $15 unlimited bloody Mary's as I watch sports on their many TV screens.  Good feel about this place all around."}
