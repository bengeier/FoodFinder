{"text":"The staff at Silver Springs Automotive are reliable and trustworthy. Steve, Duncan, Benedict, and all the other mechanics have been my team collectively since my first vehicle, and my family's before. In that time, they have saved me from unnecessary work and money spent, and have always responded to the situation at hand appropriately (e.g. not trying to upsell or add work in when I've had a smashed windshield or a dented panel). They just completed work on my new (used) truck and again the service was excellent and their work was honestly priced. They helped me find peace of mind and confidence in my truck. I recommend this shop to my friends and family, so hopefully you will have a good visit."}
{"text":"I took in my vehicle to this shop multiple times for various reasons but the last time I took it in was to get an overheating issue dealt with and they quoted $2000 or more to fix the head gasket so I declined and decided to sell it on Kijiji for $1000. The buyer got back in touch with me about the real issue which was the thermostat that needed to get replaced and not the head gasket!! Silver Springs Automotive screwed me more than once and I should've got a second opinion in the first place instead of selling my car!! Avoid this place especially if you're a woman or they will take advantage and rob you blind."}
{"text":"Automotive garage right across the street from me.  I called to get my winter tires off (mid June, I know...I know)  They just told me to come by and they would take care of it.  I dropped off my car and was barely home for 45 minutes before they called and said it was done.  Fast, fair price, friendly."}
