{"text":"Proud to support family owned restaurant.  I love riding my bike to the garden pizza and chilling out.  I do want a bar added to the  restaurant.  Overall tasty."}
{"text":"The mozerella sticks are the best. Come here just for them. Not crazy about the pizza but its not bad either. You have to pay for refills on drinks. The customer service is only good when the owner is in.  He is always on his phone however he is really nice and provides good customer service otherwise. All the other employees are not very welcoming. And the place seems to always be dirty."}
{"text":"Chicken Parm hero's are awesome,  reminds me of being home,  New York..... great service,  Wife loves the meatball Parm hero's. ..."}
{"text":"So nice to finally find a family run and authentic restaurant in Goodyear.  Food was great, the atmosphere is friendly, and the food was fantastic.  The fact that they deliver is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and great,fun people.He  always calls us his friend and makes us feel welcome.Very best hoagies hot"}
{"text":"Thank you for quick delivery this evening and great pizza!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their pizza & wings!! Best place here in Goodyear/Buckeye that I have came across!! They're all so humble and nice and their pizza is delicious!!"}
{"text":"On a low carb diet and Benny made us a skillet pizza. It was delicious! All the toppings of a supreme without the crust. My son had 2 slices which got an A + from him as well."}
{"text":"pizza is ny style, owners are amazing, the pasta dishes are great..."}
{"text":"Have ordered pizza and wings from Garden Pizza multiple times and every time it is fantastic. They have good specials and good service. Definitely recommend this local family owned business."}
{"text":"This is essentially a New York style pizza restaurant except the sauce isn't as sweet. It's pretty good and they have lots of things other than pizza on the menu. I was surprised at all they served. They have lots of beer too. The location is great."}
{"text":"I like this joint. The Sicilian pizza is very good. My only thing I am wondering about is this place, Taste of Italy and Palermo's all seem to be the same place. Not that it's a big deal, but it seem like a franchise without \"being a franchise\". Same menu, same specials, same prices.  Hmmmm."}
{"text":"i'm thoroughly amazed at reviewers who whine about paying $17 for a large pizza with two toppings.  It reminds me of my late father-in-law, visiting from Poland, who, when we took him to a store selling Polish foodstuffs in Glendale, looked at a package of pierogi for $ 4.99 and indignantly said he doesn't pay more than 50 cents for them back in Krakow. Of course, he had an excuse:  he wasn't comparing the salaries of the average American to the average Pole.  But seriously?  $17 for a pizza?  What century are you living in?  Believe it or not, when it comes to \"cheap\" dining, Arizona does pretty well compared to most of the country.  Cheap people living in an unrealistic parallel universe aside, the owner of this place used to run a pizza place in Avondale, where the food was quite good; and that tradition has carried over to this place.  The bread on the calzone tastes delicious (it wasn't my calzone, so I couldn't try more than a corner of it; but I've been assured it was very tasty) and the sausage parmesan I had was also very good.    No, it's not bargain-basement prices; but good food costs money and when you think of the costs of rent, food and paying employees, these prices are not unreasonable.  If you think they are, may I suggest the tacky pizza shells you buy at Fry's, a bottle of pizza sauce, all the veggies you can buy and an oven.  Let's see if you can do it for under $17."}
{"text":"I have been there twice and both times the man with the thick accent is working the register as well as handling the pizza with no gloves. The second time I went I told him not to give me the pizza he had touched. He got annoyed and became rude. Never going there again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Garden Pizza today for lunch. Everything was great. The food was good, it came out quick, the place was clean, everything.  Then, we found a bug in our wings. Completely disgusted, we asked for a refund. The cashier guy old us he would refund us for only one wing because we, and I quote, \"Could have found the bug somewhere else\". I will NEVER go to Garden Pizza again. Not to mention the guy was a creep"}
{"text":"Every time  I go into the place I see fresh pizza being made. I always go for the sandwiches and the wings. On occasion I order pizza's as well, and I have yet to be disappointed. I generally go every other week and the guys know me pretty well and what I like to order which is good because sometimes I don't know what I want. The prices are a bit more expensive compared to the franchise pizza places but for the size and the amount that you get it is well worth the price.  I enjoy the place and recommend people to go and try it out."}
{"text":"Went there a couple days ago for lunch.  The food is always good, but as I walked in there was a really strong smell of what I thought was body odor throughout the restaurant.  I think it wasn't BO, but the garbage can right next to the door.  The can was disgusting and obviously hasn't been cleaned in some time judging from the food remnants on the outside.  After a few minutes you get used to the smell but it certainly wasn't appetizing at all.  I don't know how the owner's could not do something about it."}
{"text":"We're from Chicago, so we know Pizza when we taste it. This is pizza is freaking AMAZING! When we have this pizza it reminds us of Chicago (we prefer flat over deep dish- sorry my Chi-town peeps). You can't go wrong with this pizza joint. IMO hardly any grease. Don't know why others have left bad reviews, but we only do takeout pizza & wings (haven't really checked the rest of the menu out).  I will say the place looks always clean when I walk in there."}
{"text":"Just moved into the area try the  garden pizza. Their price is very reasonable maybe there cook was off today they need help in the cooking department Pizza  was overcooked Crust was hard as a rock and very greasy when I was holding a piece of pizza The oil was running down my arm  chicken wings over Cook The chicken was burnt"}
{"text":"We have been there a few times and the food is good. Unfortunately it is not out of the ordinary. It falls into the same category as other gourmet pizza restaurants. With that said, Pizza is something rather hard to rate. Pizza Hut, Dominos, and Papa Johns. All deserve a 2 stars.. So this is better pizza than that. However, don't expect a party in your mouth. I'd buy this before others. Service is ok."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We kept talking about going in and we finally did. We had the philly cheasesteak, shrimp basket and pizza. YUMMY! My advice: DON'T  WAIT! Prices are great, food is great and the staff is super nice. What more could u ask for?"}
{"text":"First time to visit this establishment. Pizza was reasonably good. Salad was could use some help with lettuces other than just iceberg. Bathrooms were dirty. On a good note staff was friendly."}
{"text":"My husband I finally tried Garden Pizza last week for dinner. We ordered wings, zucchini, and a pizza. The zucchini were burnt, pizza was average, and wings were disappointing. Service was alright. Nothing was good enough to make us want to come back."}
{"text":"These pizzas are Huge!! I got two large pepperoni pizzas and two days later still have 1/2 a pizza left over. Now we are a family that loves pizza but, as big as these slices are all we needed was one to fill us up. The mozzarella was very tasty and had a chewy New York style crust. Went back a second time and still same great service."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, wings and subs here.  The Italian sub is excellent!  Owner is friendly as is most of the staff.  The specials are really reasonable in price.  The pizzas are huge and addicting!"}
{"text":"This place is by far the best place for hot sandwiches. My fave is the submarine. The guy comes off to be a bit rude by honestly I don't give a hoot, i just want my yummy sandwich. This place it always clean and peaceful!!"}
{"text":"My family has ordered pizza from Garden Pizza on a couple of occasions but have never dined in. My husband and I decided to  dine in as the football preseason was on and Garden Pizza Was playing it. So we order a large sausage pizza and wings. I really like the wings , as they are a normal size, not those over over injected, fatty wings, and the pizza was great as it has been on the previous occasions. I Think I was most impressed by the service. I could tell it was completely family owned, and run. I love that. It makes me smile. I would dine in again and would recommend this mom and pop business to anyone. Oh, and I just found out that they deliver . That's a plus because I didn't think that they used to!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Garden Pizza for lunch today.  My wife and daughter and I each had two slices of Peperoni and a pitcher of beer.  The pizza was good especially the crust which was crisp but not over cooked.  The beer was cold and served with chilled mugs.  I noticed some subs that were being prepared and they looked very good.  My only complaint would be that when we ariived there were two or three tables had not been cleaned up and the dirty plates were just sitting there."}
{"text":"Great wings. Good pizza.  Friendly service.  Clean tables and floors. However,  the bathrooms are nasty.  I would have given 5 stars, but dirty, moldy toilets. Ick!  I visited again recently and employees were smoking in the kitchen, and they blamed it on someone outside the front of the store. No one was there and the smell was coming  from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Food is awesome but some points to cleaning the place up. We always just got to go pizza, but now that we actually sat down inside im regreating ordering. This place is groas bathrooms need help, stained ceiling, dirty windows, dirty patio. I can just imagine what the kitchen looks like. Again food is awesome but pick up guys"}
{"text":"I'd bet they do most of their business during the week with a nice slice and drink special. We went in on a Saturday afternoon, it was dead. We got 4 slices, a dozen wings, and 2 small drinks. The bill was almost $22! What!? They had a special for a dozen and a medium pie and it was cheaper or about the same price. I pointed it out right after we paid and there was no reaction for the guy behind the counter. I think that's a fail on their part to suggest we look at the specials.  When we sat down, the sun hit the tables in such a way that I could see that they hadn't been cleaned. You could see the leftover parm and red pepper bits on the table. It was empty except us and 2 other people came to eat in and one to take out. There were 3 guys working that I saw. They had time to wipe down tables.   The slices were pretty huge, I probably should have ordered one. We got 3 pepperoni and mushroom and one cheese. The pizza is pre-made and they just warm it, however they did not put the toppings on before they fired it, they did it after. The pepperoni was limp and greasy since it just got residual heat from the pizza. The shrooms are canned! Ugh! I much preferred the cheese and barely ate any of my pep and shroom.   The wings are tiny and we ordered hot, it was not hot at all. The wings were crisp, but nothing special at all.  refills on drinks are 50cents.   I would not go back"}
{"text":"First time trying this pizza. $17 plus (including tax) for a medium two-topping pizza? Seriously? One of the greasiest pizzas I have ever eaten in my life. Pizza box was soaked with grease. Pepperoni tasted funny, maybe it's a different kind that I'm not used to. Not much flavor. Not going back."}
{"text":"This is GREAT pizza! Got the 'Garden Special' pizza and it was awesome. Great flavor and just the right amount of yummy cheesy greasiness. Being from NY I know my yummy greasy pizza and this is it. The marinated mushrooms they use are to die for. I highly recommend giving them a try. They are a wonderful, local business that is making some awesome food."}
{"text":"Great place. Friendly service. The crust and sauce are vegan. I had olive and mushroom w red sauce and no cheese. VERY GOOD! I only gave 4 stars because I had to order a HUGE pizza. Please consider making a personal size?"}
{"text":"Consistently great even five years later. Lot of pizza places have come and gone, but this one is still here and rightfully so."}
{"text":"We stopped in here after playing golf and we all loved our food. I had an excellent meatball sub and fries for a reasonable price.  I loved the bread as it was perfect like the kind of bread you get in Philly.  My buddies all loved their sliced pizza.  We definitely would come back when we are in this area again."}
{"text":"The pizza is standard NY Style Big Slices. Its good... the food is fresh, it just takes too long to come out to you because they make it fresh. Make sure you have an hour to kill if you eat here. The other complaint I have about this place is that they don't serve all you can drink."}
{"text":"I come here just to get the Chicken Alfredo pizza! I am the only one in my family that eats it and so the owner makes it a little bit smaller than the menu size and charges me less! So sweet! I love to come here for a quick bite to eat and watch some football! Never tried anything other than pizza and wings but have seen other things and they look tasty!"}
{"text":"It's great to help out a family business close to home with a good review. Love the food, but it's the atmosphere that sets it apart. I come in sit down and on occasion get to say hi to the family. When they speak Italian to each other it seems to make my food even taste better. Hearing Italian in a Italian restaurant go figure. I hope they stay in this location for a long time."}
{"text":"Love their pizza. Everything is made fresh and quick and tastes delicious.   We ordered 8 pizzas for a birthday party and I was afraid they wouldn't turn out as great as when we order just 1 pizza pie. I was wrong. They all tasted fresh and everyone at our party raved at how delicious the pizza was.   We continue to chose this place over many other pizza places in the area.   Support local businesses!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, perfect calzones, antipasto salad very good, calamari good and pizza was okay."}
{"text":"I have to say I would have rather ate a Totino's frozen pizza. This pizzas was worse then school pizza. Crust tasted like it was pre frozen, sauce tasted like tomato sauce with sugar the cheese no flavor tasted fake or really cheep and the pepperoni was OK at best. Will never  get this again not fit for pigs."}
{"text":"First time ordering pizza here and also the last. The pizza looked good, but its one of the worst we've ever had. If our family doesn't finish a pizza, then there is something wrong. We all tried a piece and that was it, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this restaurant is not one to recommend.  The service was not exactly friendly. The energy was low when we went in there, one customer at a table yet every table was dirty.  The salt and pepper shakers were dirty and all of the red pepper canister were very low. When we asked the opinion of the cashier on what was good besides pizza he was not at all interested in answering the question and said everything. The food was not good. My husband had the sausage spaghetti and said it was the worst sausage he has ever tasted and didnt finish. I had pizza and did not like it. We are disappointed since we try very hard to support local businesses and have wanted to try this place for a while. We will not be back. I hope the owner sees this and begins to make a change."}
{"text":"Do not patronize this place  yuck I ordered a couple slices and got day old reheated pizza.  They apparently are not honest either because they charged full price for their happy hour draft.  I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Checked back in here after a few years and forgot how great it is. The pizza is very good and the calzones are great if you ask me; also the price is a little less than the big name competition in the area. It's close to home for me and they have delivery within 5 miles. Customer service was very good and the place is always clean and smells wonderful. As a Chicago native and pizza lover I highly recommend stopping in sometime."}
{"text":"Great food & service. Would dine there again. It has an old school traditional feel that you seldom find anymore."}
{"text":"Nice little find   The Garden Pizza is a small strip mall restaurant, that has a casual and informal vibe. The restaurant has open seating, no booths so you will get a chance to meet new people.  The pizza is really very good, fresh ingredients, great sauce and crispy crust, and when they say large, they mean large.  Have to bring some home and it was just as good the next day.  I recommend Garden Pizza when you want to sit around the table with family and friends and talk while enjoying good pizza . I look forward to visiting again and trying other items off the menu."}
{"text":"We just love  this place! The pizza is one of the best in all of Phoenix and the prices are fantastic. Today I had a lunch special which included a huge plate of spaghetti with meatballs and baked mozzarella cheese, a salad and a loaf of fresh baked bread with butter for only $6.95! What?!? Olive garden would charge 3x the price for such a meal and they aren't even as good! Come here."}
{"text":"We used to stop in here weekly when we lived in Goodyear... I'm 20 miles away now and still make the drive for the pizza and wings.  Crust is fresh and has a good crunch without being dry, toppings are always delicious and evenly distributed.  The staff is quick and courteous, the owner is usually on site.  Garden will always be my go to!!!! One thing I'll add is that this pizza needs to be eaten quickly, best bet is to enjoy it there.  The crust can go a little soggy if you are driving a distance."}
{"text":"I love this place.. the pizza is New York style, the owner and most of the staff have the true New York accents, and make the pizza fresh in plain view! You can order in, pick up, and even get delivery. The prices are a little higher than your cheap pizza places like Dominos, Pizza Hut, etc .. but so much better tasting! I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Read a lot of reviews so decided to try this place. Walked to the front door and notice \"A\" food rating posted in the window. This was refreshing. Ordered the large Garden Pizza and a pitcher of draft beer. The pizza was Amazing and the beer was ICE COLD, poured in frozen beer mugs. For the most part it's a self service place, you get your condiments and silverware from the counter off to the left of the register. Did I mention the Pizza was AMAZING. Come to the Pizza Garden if you want Amazing Pizza, beer, wings. Don't come if you are afraid of a little bit of uncleanness, men's bathroom dirty, light fixtures dusty, furniture chipped and need a wiped down. No doubt this place needs to be cleaned, but I am looking to over look the cleanliness because the food is Amazing. Garden Pizza has an outside patio & I will be back because the food is Amazing."}
{"text":"The customer service here is amazing. But unfortunately thats all that shines. The bathrooms are filthy. The soap must have water added to it. Which made me think what other corners have been cut. The patio its crowded, unorganized with mismatched chairs randomly placed all over. The table were dirty as well. The pizza has a weird flavor.  Its was soggy and oily. The ranch either was spoiled or they seriously need to reconsider a different brand. The only food item which was good was the garlic bread with cheese.  I would never go back. Not even if it was free."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Always a favorite on the week night when you are not wanting to cook! Try the steak and cheese sub its awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great local pizza spot. I have been going there for years. This is my go to for pizza and wings. Pasta dishes and salads are very good but I am usually just a pizza and wing kinda guy. This is the place I always recommend."}
{"text":"I love their pizza especially and the rest of their food!super great service and gets your food out in a timely manner. Highly recommended for dine in or pick up."}
{"text":"First and last time. Just ordered a pizza single topping pepperoni.  Pizza does not fit in the box I should of known it was only going to get worse.  Burnt crust dripping grease and dough is super rubber!  Also wings. More like baby chick let's  tiny no meat , dried out looks like week old chicken.  I tossed it all in trash waste of $20"}
{"text":"Not really very good.  The place seemed nice and other reviews mentioned good pizza.  We ordered a large thin crust with tomato, mushrooms, pepper, cheese, and pepperoni.  The crust was not thin at all--and was just a touch doughy.  Lived in Italy for 4 years and this is not a \"Palermo\" crust.  Mushrooms tasted like that out of a can.    The young guy taking the order was stone-faced and didn't even say hello.  On the way out another guy (owner?) was cheerful and seemed courteous."}
{"text":"Love their pizza! If you want real thin crust New York style pizza, and you're in the Goodyear area...GO HERE! you will not be disappointed! Just an FYI- the pizza is bigger than the box so it kind of folds the crust but WHO CARES! It's the best compared to others I've tried. Pizza and salads are awesome. Only item I was disappointed in was the meatball sub... I think it may have been frozen meatballs but other subs are delish. Definitely a must. Hand tossed right in front of you. Family owned and operated. Very kind people. :-)"}
{"text":"I was that person who called at 9:45 to see if they were still delivering, considering they close at 10. At that time, I just found them on yelp and they were the closest to me. I'm extremely thankful they said yes and delivered my pizza within 20 minutes. The pizza and wings were so yummy! & all for a great price. We will for sure be ordering from here again. Thank you Garden Pizza for making my Friday night!"}
{"text":"I have ordered pizza from this place on many occasions and have never been disappointed. They are generous with the toppings and the crust is delicious. The Pizzas have always been ready as promised. When we order for for friends and guests, they are always impressed."}
{"text":"YUM! I was trying to think of something different for lunch. Sometimes, I get tired of the Estrella Parkway choices...Then, I remembered this little gem. The food is so yummy. (Got the veggie pizza). The veggies are fresh, they cook the pizza to order and the service is friendly and prompt. Prices aren't bad either!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and its not a bad place. The only issue I have with them, is that the customer service could be better. They didn't greet us when we walked in, and they stood there looking at us. All of them. Didn't ask us what we wanted to order,just stood there. it was pretty rude.   The pizza (while greasy) was great. Highly recommend the margherita pizza, with pepperoni and sausage added (extra 3 bucks)."}
{"text":"Place is cool great for the price especially if you are on the run or need a quick bite to eat on a lunch break. Go with the 6 hot wings slice of pizza and a drink for $6.25 .... Needs a woman's touch on cleanliness  i.e. Bathrooms and spiderwebs in the Windows."}
{"text":"This place needs to be cleaned... I was horrified by what I saw!  Everywhere you look there is filth - even the employees were very dirty looking and their white aprons were not washed for at least several days.  You can tell the difference from same day pizza mess and days, weeks, months of dirt built up.    Sadly I was incredibly hungry and I still tried a slice of pizza.  Either they use a \"cheese product\" or they get the cheapest and grosses cheese ever.  The texture was not right and it was mushy!  I've never seen mushy cheese before.  After one bite I slid all the cheese off and just ate the crust and sauce.  After a few more bites I threw it all out.    Not worth the cheap price and I would much rather go across the street and get Dominos... which I am not even a fan of!"}
{"text":"First of all, no one was at the counter when we walked in. We waited a couple of minutes and was finally greeted by a man. I should've stuck with my gut instinct and not ordered but I figured I'd give them a pass. We ordered 2 lunch specials and was told it should take about 5 minutes. 10 minutes later I see the same worker who was moving boxes in the back, immediately put pepperonis on the pizza without washing his hands. I mentioned it to him and requested a refund and his response was, \"the germs baked off from the hot oven\". He continued to made other excuses but bottom line...the restaurant was empty for a reason. Don't waste your time or money eating here."}
{"text":"Love the pizza....but wings are very small.  I will try wings again but if they are small I will never buy them again.  The garden salad was so fresh and it was good too. Can't wait to try other things here. So this may be my new place for pizza and salad...maybe wings we shall see....."}
{"text":"Easily the best pizza on the west side of town... Possibly the Valley in general. If you live on the fringe of civilization like I do, as far as quality pizza goes, Garden really can't be beat. I feel kinda boring in the sense that I generally only get the margherita every time I order, but.... It's really that good. According to my mother, their cheesesteaks are pretty top notch as well, but who goes to a pizzeria for cheesesteaks?  At any rate, the pizzas are huge, delicious, and always ready to be picked up in just under 20 minutes on a weekday. If you want a quality pie on the far west side that won't cut your mouth up like some of the more questionable chain-based offerings everywhere else, Garden Pizza is definitely where it's at."}
{"text":"I have to give credit for the excellent customer service, timely delivery matter and super nice delivery boy. However, the food was terrible. The supposed \"chicken Caesar salad\" had nothing but chicken and lettuce. No croutons, no cheese and super watered down dressing and chicken that tasted ancient and I could not eat it. The breadsticks we ordered were 100% inedible as they were more of a rock than anything else it took our dogs several minutes to even try to attempt to take them down. The Capicolla Sandwich was however very good. I feel bad for giving such a bad review on a family owned business however I feel robbed of inedible food. All went in the trash other than half the sandwich since the bread was hard and what we gave the dogs."}
{"text":"You know, the people are great. Really nice. The food is made quickly and the prices are good. Really the only pizza place in the area. However. The place has been going downhill. Walked in the other day and there was not a soul in the joint. Every table was dirty. The floors, doors, and trash cans were covered in gunk. It smelled like body odor. And my boyfriend who ate there with me ended up having food poisoning.  Will return here if they raise their standards of cleanliness"}
{"text":"Maybe it's my bad for ordering a sub sandwich at a pizza place, but this was probably the worst sandwich I've ever had. I finished less than a quarter of it. I ordered the turkey sub which was ready fast on a huge hunk of French bread. Too much bread really. The turkey had an odd color to it and was really gelatinous. The only flavor on the sandwich came from the Italian dressing that was all over it and it was not great at all. Thank goodness it came with a little bag of lays chips because that was the only part I could eat. It shouldn't be hard to do a decent sub, but if you can't spend the money on quality ingredients just take them off the menu.   I haven't tried the pizza, but the \"by the slice\" stuff looked yuck - greasy and not fresh. I'm definitely not planning to go back"}
{"text":"order a large pepperoni pizza, nothing special. huge slices but it was sooo greasy, even folding our pizza the toppings would slop off. So gross."}
{"text":"Pizza & Wings are decent for the price at lunch. They have lots of choices as lunch specials & gluten-free crust if you like... mild wings are kid friendly"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this restaurant, it doesn't disappoint!  It brings us back to the east coast in the middle of goodyear. The food is amazing. Pizza is big, wings are juicy, and the salad is always crisp. Prices match the quality of food you'll get here, and service is always genuine. Food takes a little longer to cook than nearby places, so I wouldn't recommend dining in if you are in a time crunch, but that's to be expected when your getting fresh ingredients and not frozen!"}
{"text":"Happy Pepperoni Pizza Day!!!!  Best pizza I've found near Buckeye. Getting down on some pizza and wings."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza we have had in Arizona! The crust is perfect, the sauce is delicious (just the right amount of sweetness), and the cheese is very obviously fresh and real! They're a little pricier but the size of the pizzas definitely make up for it. And the wings and zucchini are absolutely fantastic! It's the only place we go for pizza now. We cant wait for it to cool off so we can sit out on their patio and enjoy the fresh air along with some delicious food!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza place! The pepperoni pizza is so addicting It reminds me of a New York style pizza! Also I believe the owner is from Albania he has a very deep accent. Since eating this pizza I haven't wanted anywhere else! They have a delicious salad as well with the best Italian salad dressing. If you haven't tried it you have to trust me. Groups of construction workers come in & out for lunch and head straight towards the bathroom to clean up! So they can enjoy there meal I read the reviews about the bathroom I think this sums that up! I love this pizza it's the best in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Tried the meatball, sauce and cheese sub and the steak, onion and cheese sub and both were very good. The fried zucchini was decent but nothing special. At some point I really need to try their pizza."}
{"text":"Love their pizza!  Eat here a lot!  Love the big New York style slices you have to fold to eat."}
{"text":"Pizza is good! The wings are bomb! Crispy just how I love them :) the single slices are pretty big n cheap of you ask me. Sucks that they charge for refills. I haven't personally tried anything else on the menu so I can't really say much about that. Give it a try and see for your self"}
{"text":"The place is GREAT! The food is GREAT! They also have GREAT lunch specials! The employees are nice and welcoming! I will be making more stops here! If your looking for a great place to eat in or take out this is the place  to go. One of the guys even told me that they even deliver so thats a plus! :)"}
{"text":"First time ordering from this place and will never order again. Pizza came on time, ordering over the phone was easy, but when the pizza came..... It omg was just uneatable. I am from Chicago, I know my pizza, this place doesn't cut it at all! The dough was so thin that the whole pizza can't hold even cheese. Parents had a supreme and it all fell apart. They had to get a knife and fork. Yes I love my deep dish pizza and I eat it with a fork and knife too but at least deep dish is tasty, this was just dreadful. Very greasy and the bottom of it was slightly burned. I called and complained and they apologized and said in 10 min they will bring another. It came and it was EXACTLY THE SAME. I am not sure how people like this type of pizza but even the cheese looks all weird like someone chewed it and spit it on the dough. Never ordering from this place either. Shame you say it's from the heart of New York, because New York pizza is amazing too and this is just embarrassing. Go to rosatis pizza, not sure how to spell it, but that's really good Chicago pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered the special slice which I'd have to say was a lot bigger than I have expected! I love thin pizzas and theirs was just that! They were generous on my slice with toppings. I had mine to go so it was as fresh out the oven but I def would come back again and recommend to others. It's not inexpensive but wasn't over priced... this is a case of \"you get what you pay for\" and I enjoyed their friendly service and the pizza as well."}
{"text":"We have ordered pizza to go a couple times from Garden Pizza and have enjoyed it, but recently we decided to stop in for dinner. I have a whole new opinion of the place since then. I really enjoyed the staff who were extremely welcoming to us and all of the patrons they interacted with. We ordered a large meat pizza which was huge! My husband can eat pizza so I was shocked when we had several pieces left. We were also happy to see the pizza and wing combos that are available. I ordered a glass of wine which turned out to be a mug of wine (did I mention I love this place) for $3.50. It's close to our house and an amazing local business. They also have awesome salads. We will definitely be back!"}
