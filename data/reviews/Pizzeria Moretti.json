{"text":"So happy happy happy !!! Every time I come into Moretti's I am greeted the same way \"happiness and comfort\"... do try the patate con cipolle pizza and a side of their veal meatballs ... your mouth and taste buds will be I heaven !!! Pair it up with a Aperol Spritz and you'll feel as though you're in Rome."}
{"text":"The staff should remember, in Montreal, your hot place today is closing down tomorrow. Was told there was no space very arrogantly then was offered 1 spot at the bar while my husband could stand up as the host laughed and walked away. Never going back, after all they'll be closed within the year just like the last restaurant in that location. Learn how to speak to potential customers, you never know when you'll need the business - I mean they sell pizza like a quarter of the other restaurants in the area do. Didn't try the food gave it 2 stars as it looked like a nice place but won't bother trying to go back to try the food."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and enjoyed the food both times. I had the tagliolini funghi and the burrata pizza. Both the pasta and the pizza are great, you really can't go wrong. It also has a great atmosphere. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Since moving into the condo directly above this restaurant, my interest to try this place was there. However, I will never bother. The staff use the drive way in the back as their break area with zero consideration for the people that live there. They hangout, eat, smoke (cigarettes and pot), are loud and carry on well into the night. I recently came home to find one of the wait staff urinating on the building. When I confronted the manager about this, his first response was \"are you sure it wasn't a homeless person?\". The last time I checked, the homeless don't wear server attire complete with black aprons. I'm not about to support a local business that clearly has no respect for the people that live in the area. It's a hotspot for now, but as we know, it's only hot until the next new place and one day be replaced by Starbucks. #cantwait"}
{"text":"I've driven past this place so many times last summer and had such high expectations from the look of it and their menu.  My husband and I went with a group of friends on a cold and rainy Wednesday night with dinner reservations for 7:30pm.  Much to our surprise the place was packed!! We were greeted by the most inhospitable seating host, who didn't smile, had no courtesy to point us towards where our group was. Just gestured that they're in that corner over there ... nice. We then waited for 45min to be seated, even with reservations!!! Then they couldn't even set the table for the right number of guests!!   Now the food.... pizzas are large. Note for the vegetarians: don't go for the grilled veggie and goat cheese pizza. It's cold, the cheese isn't melted and it feels like you're eating a salad. Go for the margherita pizza instead. If you're a man and hungry, beware none of the pasta dishes will be enough for you. You'll need to get an appetizer.  The guys at the table chuckled when their small bowls of pasta were presented to them.  Had such high hopes given the trendy ambiance but thoroughly disappointed."}
{"text":"Fast sitting. Fast service. Waitress has a bit of attitude but they work very fast. Food... omg tastes amazing!!!! I give food ten stars or more! Pizza size is big and price overall is decent. Environment is family-friendly, which I love! Only down side is tables are so close together. I feel like I'm at a Japanese ramen place because I'm so close to person next to me. Not much of personal space but this can be my own personal opinion. But the taste of food is so good... who cares if you can feel person next to you. I recommend and come again!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my lunch at Moretti. The service was quite slow but I think since they just opened not long ago, this is understandable. I had the Moretti pizza with shrimps and bacon. It was a delight! The spiciness was perfect and the crust was great. There are many items on the menu that look intriguing like the mushroom pizza with black truffle or the octopus which I'll probably try next time."}
{"text":"Trendy spot. Very busy on Thursdays. The food was authentic and good, awesome pizza with their wood oven. Ambiance is really nice, lots of young professionals and it gives it a really nice vibe. The service was a little hit and miss here and there, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it was because the restaurant was packed. Nice local place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Nothing like going out for lunch on a cold glumly  day! This is a  fairly new trendy Italian spot in Griffith town. Pizza is their specialty so I ordered The Calabrese. Tasty but I prefer the ole fashion pizza verses the thin crust gourmet style.The pizza size is quite big. The Insalata Moretti which is Endives, Radicchio with grilled peaches and a pistachio vinaigrette was absolutely delicious! Dessert, Tiramisu and a cappuccino was the finale. Overall my palette enjoyed everything that was served to me. Oh did I say it's pretty expensive.. lol.."}
{"text":"Front of the house is a disaster. Literally 20 people in different groups waiting at one point, and with no one out in front greeting, people were confused and kept asking waiters if they could be sat, and the waiters were equally confused. Surprisingly or service once sat was very good, knowledgable waiter (Justin I want to say) very friendly and the food came out very quickly. Pizza is good but there's definitely better in the area. Wasn't as hot as I'd like when it hit or table. Good place for big groups though."}
{"text":"Went on Wednesday, 13 June for the birthday of my son the ambiance of the restaurant was fantastic I thought I was in Italy the food was excellent I had the gnocchi's it's a long time I didn't have a plate of pasta that good my son add and my guests at the pizza again very good you can go to that restaurant with no fear food is very good  and  The staff is very attentive and nice will come back to this restaurant thank you"}
{"text":"The restaurant serves great brick oven pizza and handmade pasta. The octopus entree is a bit expensive for one tentacle."}
{"text":"Restaurant avec un super décor mais je vous annonce la line up un samedi soir !  Tres grand choix de vin à la carte une carte restauration pas mal mais alors les prix sont assez cher pour des pizzas ou des pâtes . Si vous aller la bas pour pouvoir discuter tranquillement passer une soirée au calme c'est pas le bon restaurant trop bruyant pour moi, par contre la nourriture est cher mais les produits sont super bons."}
{"text":"Lovely decor. Food excellent although way too expensive for lunch fare: paid $18 for a single medium sized tentacle in my octopus salad. Service was good and improved since opening. As correctly mentioned by others, they charge $2 per person, for filtered water, and there is NO tap water available. Staff felt quite awkward mentioning this. On principle we boycotted drinking any water. I am not convinced this policy will last - water arrives in decanters - I certainly didn't see this fancy filter at work.   I was told they are working on a lunch menu. We will see... spending $60+ for lunch is not a regular activity for me."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start?  Just avoid this place if you want to pay for mediocre food and terrible service.  This place is happening and a hot spot, don't ask me why when there are so many other amazing options at half the price and better attentive service.  I can name 10-15 places within a 1 km radius.  I would be here all day pointing out how bad the service was as well as the food.  I'll just go point form.  1. Margarita pizza was soggy and flavourless (I would rather eat frozen pizza) $12 2. Meatballs were rubbery and served room temp (I wouldn't serve these to my dog and I don't even have 1) $13 3. Mushroom Pasta was runny and tasted way off and served in a gravy like sauce $24 (are you kidding me)  4. Diavola pizza was inedible, bland and extra soggy (we ate 1 small piece, they asked if we wanted it boxed I said throw it in the garbage where it belongs). $19 5. The only bright spot was the Draft Kronenbourg white beer 6. Service was amateurish and inattentive.  Server was preoccupied with their other tables (keep in mind the dining room was full). Still, it's appreciated when they come and ask if everything is ok.  I was honest and told them what I thought of the food and they smiled and handed me my bill.  I still tipped 15% even though I had a terrible experience.  Overall, I would never come back here.  EVER.  For amazing pizza and service Try IL FOCOLAIO, Pizzeria 900, Geppetto, Richmond Marche and Fiorelino.  They are so much better.  I could point out more negatives but I think you get the picture.  If you want to seen (trendy crowd), be served awful food and have terrible service, then by all means this IS YOUR SPOT.  Grab a seat at the bar and see for yourself.    Side note, normally I would post pictures but I wasn't motivated enough and wanted to leave ASAP."}
{"text":"I discovered this place before the opening; the big advertising on the windows attracted me, they used the Dolce & Gabbana's \"Italian Family\" Starring Monica Bellucci, you can still see it on their website: wondering if they are partners with D&G?  At my first visit, the guy who handles reservations wasn't consistent: he said that he only takes night reservations for 19h and 21h, and that I couldn't pick a specific table. However, when I pointed out a table he said that it was already reserved for 20h30. He couldn't give me a reasonable explanation why these people could choose their table and pick a different time, and his tone changed to agressive! I ended the conversation, by thanking him for his time.  Still, I gave them a chance, to try their pizza. At the table, I asked the waiter, who was friendly and polite, to taste a draft beer which is usually acceptable, at first he refused for no apparent reason, I then requested him to ask the manager; he finally agreed. We later asked him other questions about the menu, he seemed lost as he didn't know what to reply; probably it was a lack of training and experience. I shared a Mushroom and truffles pizza and a Calzone, both were salty, but the dough was good."}
{"text":"Pricey but good food and nice place...  Be careful with the tips... It is a scam... You are obliged to choose the tips from a list of proposed percentages and the calculation is not correct because it is based on the tax amount... So when giving 15%, you give 17% in reality #tipsscam"}
{"text":"Average food.  Did not have the wine we wanted, so they brought what they said was equivalent.  Ended up being $95.00 per bottle.  They brought the second bottle without asking, and we figured might as well keep it.  Waitress brought a glass to the table and filled it and said cheers.  There is a $$ rating on this restaurant, yet our bill came to $500 US for 2 people.  They can keep their co-ed bathroom as well.  Won't return."}
{"text":"Who the he'll is the guy who answers the phone for reservations!??? I call asking about whether they carry my liquor... he was basically extremely unenthused to be answering the phone, told me to hold on, comes back and rudely says they have the brand. I asked what flavour and he then replied ' well, I don't know, you have to find out'..... I said: that's what I'm trying to do! He then basically ended the call. I obviously opted OUT from making a reservation if that service is any indication of how my party would have been treated."}
{"text":"Pizzeria Moretti est plus qu'une pizzeria. Nous étions 4 personnes et avons partagé plusieurs plats de pâte et pizza et tout était excellent. La pizza bianca patate cipole était vraiment bonne , une belle découverte. Service courtois et attentionné de la part de Valérie notre serveuse. Nous y retournerons."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, design, and decor.  We've had a few meals there and are big fans.  Haven't had the pleasure of having dinner there but it looks very romantic with every table lit by candlelight.  We did have lunch there.  The staff was very nice and friendly.  Even the manager seemed to take interests in customers and took the time to engage in some small talk with us and made sure we enjoyed our meal.  I love to see that.  It's rare and that level of attention makes a huge difference.  I LOVE their squid ink pasta with seafood!!!  The pizzas (Margarita and Sicilian) are also good.  My husband liked their lasagna, but I was too into my squid ink pasta to even give the lasagna a chance.  The kale and yellow beetroot salad was tasty, but could have been better.  Perhaps a mix of kale and other greens so it's not so kale-y.  Hahaha...sorry, can't find a better description at the moment.  But if you try it, you'll see what I mean.  I do have one disappointing experience, but is minor.  They forgot to cut our pizza when we ordered take-out one night.  Was a little annoying because we were not home and they did not provide any utensils.  So you can just imagine what a mess we made of our pizza and hands.  Four stars regardless because everything else was stellar."}
{"text":"I heard this spot opened not long ago, and a buddy of mine was having his birthday there tonight so I was very excited to finally get the chance to try this up and coming griffintown gem. We were a party of 14, it took us a while to be seated but that's totally fine, the place was jammed packed, the decor was sleek and modern with a beautiful bar and big open spaces filled with big groups enjoying there night, and way back in the corner there's the wood fire pizza over, what a beautiful site watching the chef do his thing back there. Let's get to the food.   Once seated we ordered a few drinks, and then the waitress took all our orders while explaining every question we had about the menu. I took the salmon tartar and the burrata pizza, which was topped with wild mushrooms, black truffle and burrata, which is a softer cheese, it's a cross between ricotta and bocancini. So the app cane first, tasted great, salmon tartar in a bed of avocado with a few croustini, fantastic. They this gorgeous pizza came my way... this thing looked like a work of art, all the ingredients complimented each other, the dough was soft but crisp a little just the way I love it.  It was my buddy's birthday so they surprised him with a platter of goodies like truffles, cookies, cakes. All tasted great. I'm glad I got to try this place and I'll be back that's for sure."}
{"text":"Ok let's start.  The decor is trendy/industrial chick and very well designed. The fried calamar tastes like nothing, wasn't oily, but has no taste, not enough dip, and presented poorly. The pizza was great, crusty dough and fresh ingredients. The manager was nice and very welcoming though the staff don't smile and you are afraid to ask them something. Overall I give this place 3 out of 5, hopefully it gets better since it is still new and there is always a learning curve for every new restaurant opening."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about Pizzeria Moretti, so needless to say I was pretty excited to give it a try, being the pizza addict that I am. I am soooo happy that I did ! I really enjoyed everything about this place. For starters , the location is pretty big inside with lots of seating to accommodate for larger groups as well as a date night. The Decor inside is a great mix of clean and modern meets cozy and rustic, which made for a great ambience. The place was full when I went but yet we still did not feel jammed in and still got quick attentive service. We ordered a platter of fried seafood as a starter , which included calamari, shrimp and fish.  The platter was not oily and was not too heavily battered so you could still taste the freshness of the seafood. We tried two of their pizzas , both of which were excellent. The dough itself was thin crust , very tasty and perfectly cooked. We tried the Moretti which had Shrimp on it , it was super tasty and the shrimp were huge and delicious. We also tried the Capriciosa, which had artichoke, mushrooms and Prosciutto , this one was my favourite by far ! Although honestly both were very good. They also serve pasta , as well as an assortment of other starters and dessert. The prices are very reasonable, especially when considering the quality and the generous portion size ! If you will be two people a good idea might be to share a starter and stare a pizza and/or pasta. I look forward to coming back here and trying more of their dishes , I highly recommend this restaurant for all the pizza lovers out there also !"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this restaurant hasn't gotten very good reviews. I loved it and would definitely be back. I'm so happy this resto is close-by.  This restaurant is really nice inside. We went on a Thursday night and it was packed!   We got a bottle of red wine, three pizzas, and one seafood pasta for four people. I felt it was fairly priced.  All three pizzas were so tasty and they were quite big. I don't like crust usually but this one was good. It was not too thick and not too thin. We got the Diavola, the Americana and the Moretti. The Americana had tons of meat on it including prosciutto and the Moretti had big shrimps on it. These were my two favorite pizzas. Seafood squid ink pasta was flavorful but I preferred the pizzas. It had calamari, mussels, clams and shrimp.   The only downside is that they charge $2 for filtered water. They just pour the water without asking what kind of water you want and they don't tell their customers about the fee. It's a surprise you get when you see the bill. But luckily we had read about this beforehand and we asked about it right away. However the $2 is per table, not per person."}
{"text":"Pizzeria localisée dans Griffintown, ouverte en 2017. J'avais donc une réunion avec mes anciens collègues du Collège Lasalle et on a décidé de se rencontrer ici même. On a bien sûr fait une réservation auparavant, car assez remplit et un peu bruyant, un samedi soir bien sûr, beaucoup de groupes y étaient. Belle ambiance chic & moderne du même style que ''Fiorellino'' dans le Quartier International. Pour ma part, pas la meilleure pizza en ville, mais c'était bon quand même. J'ai pris une pizza margherita (16$) *assez grosse portion merci* + une bouteille de San Pellegrino (7,50$). Prix corrects sur le menu, service courtois & rapide du serveur pour la soirée. Très recommande si vous êtes dans Griffintown.  4/5 visité en février 2018"}
{"text":"Trendy bourgeois/yuppie pizza joint in Griffintown.  It's in diagonal from another Griffintown pizza joint, Industria.  You'll be getting a very good pizza, ingredients are fresh, service somewhat fast.  You'll be paying yuppie prices.  Waitress seemed flustered when I didn't order a $60 bottle of wine with my $18 pizza.  The place is really somewhere between a 3 and a 4.  The interior is very nice, has that faux-Italian feel with a north american touch.  Would not be opposed to going back but you can find better in Montreal.  Would not be in my top 10 pizzas in Montreal."}
{"text":"The appetizers and pasta dishes are good but nothing that I would return for.  This place shines when it comes to pizza. Their dough is really very good, the sauce is perfect and the cheese is milky perfection.  However, I am only awarding 2 stars because of the arrogance of the managing staff and because they were very obvious in letting me know children were not welcome. I never went there with children but when I tried to reserve for 6 adults and 1 baby at 5 PM I was told that they do not offer high chairs. I also saw them refuse a table to a couple with a child. It made me very uncomfortable.  As much as I enjoyed the pizza on both occasions, I am not willing to put up with the attitude."}
{"text":"We made a reservation here two weeks ahead for a Saturday night at 9:30 pm and waited an hour once we got to the restaurant. The foyer was packed with people and they did absolutely nothing to accommodate us - did not even offer for us to start with drinks at the bar. The maître d avoided talking to us and did nothing to mediate the situation. After over an hour of waiting, he told us to leave. There were many parties in the same situation. Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. They are extremely poor at managing their restaurant as well as customer service. We did not receive a single apology and our Saturday night was ruined. Very turned off and disgusted."}
{"text":"The restaurant is great. Nice decor, cozy place & good food. I made reservation 2 days ago. When I came, asked to be seated next to the window. The host replied that these are reserved. I then replied that i also made a reservation. He then replied, well they made  reservation 1 month ago in order to be seated next to the window. With such an answer, I had the urge to leave the restaurant !  I ordered a Burrata and a Parma. If you like truffles, this is the pizza to order. It is also seasoned with truffle oil. Hence u will feel the truffle taste in every bite. For the Parma, i had better elsewhere... Lets not forget to mention that the waiters are very friendly."}
