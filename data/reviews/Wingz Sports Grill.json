{"text":"If you want just something to drink, this place will work. But good luck with the dining (We sure didn't.).  After waiting almost an hour. The hostess had to see how we were served nothing. (Only our drinks by her).  After she checks to see what happened with our order,  she had to tell us that they lost it or something. So we back to the old ways...

    Guess with the stories I've been told,  I shouldn't be surprised"}
{"text":"This should be the next place in this plaza to close it's doors in a line of empty buildings. I go here because my child practices next door, and every time I walk through the door I have simple expectations of adequate service and edible food. Pretty low expectations but even that is too high. 

Food isn't good. I sat at a table at the bar for 20 minutes before I went to the bartender and asked for food and drink myself. 

I love strongbow and apparently diarrhea!"}
{"text":"The owners Chris and Tracy went above and beyond their job description to help us make the best of a difficult day with helping us host my brothers reception after his funeral. They helped us plan the food we would need and even brought in staff to help. The food was good and the service excellent I would recommend them to anybody .

{"text":"I wasn't that impressed.  We should've just gone to the Winking Lizard.  I think they cater to the same type of crowd except the atmosphere's is a little barnish (not sure why, maybe because it's a big open space).  We got boneless wings and I liked the sauces, but I think the chicken was maybe too fried, not sure but something about it I didn't really care for all that much.  There also were way too many children in this place for 9:00pm.  
There is a little game area in the back which is kind of cool."}
{"text":"We have been patrons of this place for 7 yrs. ....mostly during football season. The wings here have improved 100%. If you are looking for a great place to catch a game with good beer specials and excellent chicken wings...this is it! So happy they have made it against all the chain competition in the area!"}
{"text":"My favorite wings in the world. I've been eating them for over 10 years now. The bartenders are great too"}
{"text":"lets me start off by my server was excellent and was very nice. The wings are of average size and  below in taste. They are so overpriced got dozen wings  and 1 lbs pretty sure there was not pound there of boneless wings and one beer and water $38.00 dollars before tip. Even on non wing night that's most I have paid for just ok wings in long time."}
{"text":"Is this a bar or a hang out for kids? It's a huge establishment but always empty. Nothing special here. Kids probably around 12 were in there playing the video games and there were no parents or anyone else. Is that even legal? I avoid this place if I can help it"}
{"text":"Why does this bar smell like someone is smoking directly next to me? Sitting in the main DINING area you smell all the smoke from the smoking area. Totally disgusting."}
{"text":"For the past year....this place gets worse every visit! It's dirty and the food is so bad now!!! The service was bad and I'm officially not going back. It's a shame 2-3 years ago it was good, my wings had so much sauce on them it was disgusting. Server never came back for refills. Worst part is navigating through all the smoker out front of the door smoking while you're trying to walk in."}
{"text":"For a place with the name \"Wingz\", their wings are inferior. So much breading and the sauce lacks any real flavor. The rest of the menu is the same way. Good ideas with no real substance in flavor or preparation. Waiting to be seated has almost become a game of seeing how long it will take for someone to notice us. This isn't a restaurant I go to often, but when I do I wonder why. I never seem to remember my past experience. It must be that forgettable. 

Cleanliness is obviously something they overlook, especially in the bathrooms. Which I try to avoid at all costs.

The only redeeming qualities to this place are their macho nachos and the fact that they have Strongbow on tap. That's not something you find very often in a place that serves alcohol. If you're seeing a movie at Hickory Ridge and just want somewhere to eat quick, sure try your luck. As a stand alone meal, I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Service isn't that good, but the food is so good! Amazing fried pickels. On the week days they are slow so it's usually nice and quite. It's located right next to a movie theater too. If you want good food, and your expectations on service are more on that of a sorts bar and not a restaurant, you will like this place."}
{"text":"We were here for a fundraising event so we only had the food & drink provided as part of the fundraiser. The pizza was icky but the wings were a little better. The salad looked frightening so I avoided it. This place gets two stars b/c they do have games...and it was only $20 for unlimited food and drink even though the food was iffy and the drink was limited to Miller Lite."}
