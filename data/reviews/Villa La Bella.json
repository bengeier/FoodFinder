{"text":"OMG! The desserts looked amazing (that's why I gave it one star). I ordered $75 worth of cakes, pastries, tarts, etc. to bring to a party. Oh boy, was I ever embarrassed when we all bit into the cake. It was like cardboard...no flavor, not moist. SO SO DISAPPOINTING. It didn't get better with the rest of the items purchased. Stay clear of the bakery!"}
{"text":"Honestly, i would never attempt to open a sushi restaurant, so i have no idea why these people are attempting italian, with at least some time spent in Italy to grasp its concept.

The crêpe i had was deplorable, what was supposed to be whipped cream, clearly came out of a can and looked like sea foam. Needless to say i was grossed out from the minute it hit the table. I was very disapointes, the crêpe had a mushy texture too, ah it was a mess.  Thy probably made my crêpe at the same time they started my mothers meal which took longer to prepare and let mine sit. Regardless the flavour was dull and i got to wash it down with battery acid (coffee).

I gave this place two stars because as horrible as this was, the manager at least had the common decency to comp the meal as she even looked disgusted with my meal.

Will not go back!"}
{"text":"This place accommodates requests with a real can-do attitude. 

The food is all very good, the service is attentive, and the price cannot be beat. 

I've had pasta for dinner which was great, but mostly find myself here for brunch. The best item I've had so far was the chicken and asparagus crepe (with 2 over easy eggs added!). It was just awesome.

Bonus: Since the bill was over $30, they knocked $5 off the top. What! Great."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast. The  service was just perfect.
Thank You Lucio Da Rocha for a great treat."}
{"text":"best italy restaurant ever??love so much? i will be back soon. Stop by Saturday for a lunch."}
{"text":"Needed a brunch place in the Clarkson Mississauga area and found this little Italian themed brunch/dinner eatery that hit the spot.

It's a little gem of a restaurant that is eager to please - the decor is a bit to be honest, is a bit bizarre and out of place but the food says different.

Eggs cooked (poached soft) perfectly on the side of hash browns, bacon, and home fries. 

The best part of the meal is the care taken to prepare and present the food - the meal didn't arrive greasy like most brunch diners, bacon was nice and crisp, and the fruit without any rinds, which was nice subtle touch.

Coffee was alright but like most breakfast places, bottomless :)

Service was friendly and attentive - 

Doesn't seem like it's a well known breakfast destination just yet so I'm enjoying the fact that we didn't have to line up to get in :)

Worth a try if you're in the area or if the backlog from sunset is too long.

Thanks"}
