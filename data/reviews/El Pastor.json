{"text":"Tamales are excellent!  Staff is friendly and the place is pleasant.  I had the taco dinner with an extra tamale to go.  The rice and beans are authentic and I really did like the tacos very much.  The only complaint I had was their hot sauce really wasn't hot enough for my taste but all in all, I will be back."}
{"text":"I have been to El Pastor plenty of times but haven't had the chance to review it. The fact that I have been back many times should be a tell-tale sign that I enjoy their food, but let me explain why I am a fan.  I am Mexican-American (Chicana) and I got some delicious, authentic Mexican fare made by my wonderful mom while growing up, so if I go to a Mexican restaurant a second time, it has to be good.  El Pastor is honestly one of the only Mexican restaurants I go to in Madison when I am craving some yummy tacos or some mole.  My personal favorite are their tacos de lengua (cow tongue for my adventurous eaters). Sprinkled with onions and cilantro, they are simple perfection. I also enjoy their chicken flautas, gorditas, and anything covered with their mole. Don't forget to wash everything down with their sweet horchata (flavored rice milk)!  Of course nothing will compare to mom's home cooking, so I can't give them a 5 star, but man am I hungry after writing this. Yum!"}
{"text":"I just want to mention that the caldo de res here is really very good.  I pack away a whole bowl.  I've had caldo de res other places, and this one is particularly fresh tasting.  The beef is nice and tender, the broth is flavorful, and vegetables are fresh tasting.    I don't claim to be an expert on the dish, but of all the places I've eaten at in Madison, it's my absolute favorite.  I'd order it again, and again (and in fact I've been doing that)."}
{"text":"This place is pretty straight forward. It's very much where the local Madison resident population hangs out/gets their food. I could see the food being less consistently good at times just because the place seems very informal.   The price is right though and it hasn't bit me yet. Portions aren't too shabby and they have everything you might need.  Take a ride on the wild side, head done Park St. and give this simple but more authentic joint a chance."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! I continually order the same thing, but I tell myself I will one day try something else :-). I do not agree with another reviewer who said that their steak quality is not good, I actually think it's QUITE good for the price and expectations you would have for this type of restaurant. Quality service.  I've been there MANY TIMES and WILL RETURN!"}
{"text":"The tacos here are fantastic. Super fresh meat, cilantro, cheese, etc. They are really friendly there, and also make a good margarita.  The steak tacos are my favorite. You can taste the homemade deliciousness!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for hispanic dishes in Madison, the food is authentic, and the staff is extremely polite. Never had a bad experience and I've eaten here many times. Love the chili rellenos & the costillas asadas."}
{"text":"They're ok. The steak isn't tender so that means it's not my first nor second choice. But I do stop in when I specifically just want chicken tamales, rice and beans. Not as attentive sometimes, I have to ask for every detail and one time the waiter got frustrated. I may not know everything they have, excuse me. Maybe he didn't understand me. I wanted mole sauce for my tamale."}
{"text":"We eat here ALL the time. The food is always great--authentic Mexican--definitely not TexMex. Staff is always super friendly and the guacamole is delicious, as are the tacos!  They serve breakfast too!"}
{"text":"Decent food in a bad location.  I don't like hanging out on south park if I don't have to."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in town. I think Taqueria Guadalajara has better food in general, but I prefer El Pastor. The tacos are just as good and it is easier to get to and always easy to get a seat; and the tacos are fantastic! The staff is very welcoming, making it easy to come back regularly.  If you order one of the meals, get an extra taco a la carte. They are too good to come in here and not have at least one."}
{"text":"This place has decent food. The Chorizo quesadillas were off awful in my opinion the horchata they gave me had a weird after taste. When they gave me my food they didn't give me a fork to eat with. But the chips and salsa were good that's the only thing I liked"}
{"text":"We had a second gift certificate to use, so we went back, for lunch this time and stuck to the mainstream of the menu with a pork chimichanga and a pork burrito, both of which were enormous and pretty good."}
{"text":"The excellent food more than makes up for the lack of ambience. My favorite were the tacos- chorizo, cabeza, lengua and pastor. The menudo was really good, too. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"The prices are average but the food is above average. The portions were generous and everything was well made.  Although the seating area seems generic I would have given 5 stars if the service had been better."}
{"text":"Ive been eating at  El pastor for about 10 years. it's gone through at least 2 owners but its still one of my two favorite mexican eateries. these guys probably have the best pastor tacos in town, though taqueria guadalajara comes real close...they have  more extensive menu of platillos or dinners that some but I go mainly for the tacos...which are consistently awsome. the dinners are really good some days and some days they are just OK  but they get fat props from me anyway...  PS Anyone who doesnt go to this place simply because it's on park street...probably still holds mommie's hand while crossing the street"}
{"text":"This is one of my standby places to eat. The lengua and cabeza tacos are always great, and super cheap too. I've never had bad service there.  I find it to be sort of halfway between taqueria-style and Meximerican. Which I have no problem with, whatsoever."}
{"text":"I usually get the meat entrees but I just LOVE their avocado chimichangas! So crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Definitely worth a try!  Chips and salsa were just ok."}
{"text":"Loaded tacos good food. I had the tacos Pastore and lingua. Mexican style with cheese.Grilled jalapeno. Side of  beans. Great value. They also have complimentary chips and salsa. Nice staff snf goid service."}
{"text":"I come here pretty frequently... Okay probably too frequently as it's so close to where I work 3 days a week. Great service. The caldo de res is so super good (beef soup), full of zucchini, carrots, and potatoes. Tacos are cheap and good. The sautéed shrimp with garlic is also good. It's nice to have a Mexican restaurant that serves more than just enchiladas, burritos, and tacos."}
{"text":"I went there once and will not be back. I ordered the steak fajitas and was disappointed firstly when the plate came out as just a plate and not a sizzling entree as per usual with fajitas. However, the taste was much worse. The steak was of the lowest quality I've tasted (it looked boiled more than pan seared, and was mostly fat). There was so much salt on the fajitas that I couldn't even eat them. That being said, our waiter was a nice guy who gave us good service, but the food that i got was too bad to make it worth going back for me."}
{"text":"I live close to La Mestiza on Madison's west side, but I'd rather go to El Pastor. It's quieter, the staff is friendlier, and the food is great.  I've had several things off the menu (all good) but my favorite, by far, is the whole fried tilapia. It is exactly as billed - a whole fish, lightly floured and fried to perfection. It's fiddly food, to be sure - you're picking around a carcass. But it is absolutely delicious and well worth the effort. The fish comes with your choice of rice and beans, or salad and fries. Both options come with tortillas on the side, so you can make your own fish tacos, if you like.   The margaritas are great - and are 2-for-1 on Wednesday evenings. They also have a variety of Mexican soft drinks (including Mexican Coca-Cola, made with sugar). And beer, of course.  My dining companion and I have been here so often, in fact, that we have a code for when one of us wants to go to El Pastor. We just say, \"Let's go eat a fish.\" We always leave sated and happy."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good. Not a huge fan of the regular salsa, but I love the salsa verde. Rice is fantastic! Delivery was fast and correct. Definitely will recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. (I suppose I can't end my review here, can I?)  It's pretty authentic stuff and all really interesting. The chips are a bit funky, but the salsa is really interesting. Not your normal stuff at all.  I got four tacos ( I think loco, lamb, pork, and chicken), and they were all amazing. There's a huge variety, and you can't go wrong with any of them.  We also got a chicken quesadilla. Sure, boring, but it was crazy delicious. Lots of chicken though! If you're a cheese fan, ask for extra. You can thank me later.  It's a bit odd and the menu can be a bit strange too, but it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Service was friendly (truly friendly, not \"I want a tip\" friendly), food was fast, fresh, and tasty.  I had the huevos rancheros... often the egg is tough with this dish, but it was cooked properly here. The maize tortillas are AWESOME. I skipped the beans as I don't eat pork and they smelled like they were cooked with lard... I didn't ask about this because I knew the eggs, rice, and tortillas would be enough. All the salsa is homemade and authentic...if you are looking for sweet, tomato-ey salsa, this is not it...it has a deep, rich, earthy flavor. Did I mention they make all of it from scratch! Lunch was $8 including a beverage.   But the number #1 thing about this place is its people."}
{"text":"Very delicious, the flautas are the best! Bring everyone you love and hate and eat at the food place ever!"}
{"text":"El Pastor is really great! The staff is friendly, the food is authentic and very well made, the portions are a good size, and price is certainly right. Compared to the late Taqueria Guadalajara, just down the street, it comes up a bit short with its ambience and charm, but it makes up for it with plenty of space, and everything else already mentioned. I've never been disappointed here with any menu item!"}
{"text":"I ordered Enchiladas Suizas. (Chicken enchiladas smothered in a creamy, green poblano sauce)  The presentation was exactly what I would expect when I order Mexican food for takeout.  The quality of the food slightly exceeded my expectations. It was cool upon arrival (but that's to be expected when ordering Mexican for delivery). Some food items travel better than others.  I absolutely destroyed the enchilada--well done. It was dank and it hit all the flavors I was expecting it to hit. The chicken was still steaming upon digging into it and it was very flavorful. The green, cheese sauce over it was exactly what I wanted.  The sole reason I am even docking a star is because of the Spanish rice. Its flavor left much to be desired in terms of...well, flavor.   I would order this again and I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"All their items are made with fresh ingredients! The one Mexican place in Madison that doesn't give us heartburn from canned tomato sauce. I especially like the tacos lengua. My husband gets the tacos loco and or chorizo or pastor.  Their enchiladas are tasty too."}
{"text":"Underwhelming at best. The chips were stale, and the service wasn't as quick as I would expect."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great prices and great portions, so tasty. The guac is some of the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"Dont let the crowd or lack of crowd throw you off they Always serve delicious food as if as you are one of the family, classic food done right."}
{"text":"It's ok. Reviews are not really accurate. Food isn't that authentic and is just average for Mexican food. However it's cheap! 4 men had dinner for $40!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for Mexican. Kind of a hidden gem. The service is always speedy, the staff is always friendly, the food is always hot, fresh and authentic. What else can I say? The menu and pricing are similar to La Hacienda and La Bamba's but the food and overall experience is definitely a few notches above"}
{"text":"Your typical authentico fare, not much else to say other than it was tasty but nothing super remarkable. Definitely hit the spot though."}
{"text":"Great tacos.  Great service.  Kind of a dive looking place.  I recommend giving it a shot though."}
{"text":"I'm kind of surprised I gave this 2 stars a few years ago. Although I can say I still don't find a lot of the menu items overwhelmingly good - there is one simple item that is absolutely stunning here, the Chimichangas. The avocado one and spinach ones I get from time to time are what really sets this place on a pretty regular delivery/dine-in option for me."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat meat at in Madison, it's all really tasty.  But jeez louise stay away from that huitaloche load of disgusting crap.  Service is also a little slow here and I had to ask a few times for another drink.  But the food is good so it's worth it.  Just stay away from the gross corn fungus!"}
{"text":"My co workers and I are here constantly and I always crave their chorizo quesadilla  the staff is friendly and the food is delicious! I will continue to be a regular there."}
{"text":"This is our \"go-to\" place for Mexican. Best taste and by far most authentic around. If you don't like real Mexican food feel free to stop at the taco bell next door."}
{"text":"A second visit at 8:30 on a Monday night yielded good service, generous portions, and a great plate of chicken enchiladas rojas topped with a tasty cheese. The beans and rice were just as good as on my first visit and the little salad of iceberg lettuce, a slice of tomato, and sliced onion was fresh, crisp, and cold.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Solid cheap Mexican food. Yummy margaritas. The chicken and pork is better than the beef. Beef quality is actually not great.  I suggest the fajitas and burritos. You'll have leftovers."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant on Park Street hands down.Great food and employees!"}
{"text":"Awesome and authentic. Good people and great sevice both delivery and dine in experiences. Huge fan of the steak quesadilla(comes with beans and rice) and anything with the pastor. always full after and never feel like i over payed. will be one of my weekly places while i am living in madison."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food place in Madison! Never fails to deliver amazing food, and the staff is so sweet and welcoming! Love it!"}
{"text":"The mole enchiladas were pretty good, I'd go back for those. I also liked their salsa - was different. The pastor taco was just okay.  It's a clean restaurant and isn't in a bad part of town. $2.50 beers is a plus. Overall, just okay."}
{"text":"I ate here only once, but there were really top-notch tacos, and cheap.  Highly authentic.  Very fresh ingredients.  The meat was cooked just right.  The chips and salsa were also top-notch.  I am eager to return here to try more options.  But this place offers great tacos for cheap, and that's enough to keep me coming back.  =)"}
{"text":"Probably the best and most consistent taqueria in Madison. Quality and portion size have actually improved the past couple years. Good steak burritos, decent chili relenos, tacos, etc. Their chimichangas are decedent and greasy in the best possible way. Not perfect, but markedly great compared to La Hacienda up the street.  Keep an eye out for the corn fungus tacos."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican restaurant in a convenient location. I don't go there much since Taqueria Gaudalajara is so close and I think they have better steak and pastor.   You will be happy coming here, no disappointments on the menu, good service, good prices."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times to eat some tacos, menudo, and tamales. I think the tacos here beats Taqueria Gaudalajara. Yeah, I said it! TG isn't horrible, but I preferred the tacos at this place, especially the pastor.   Service is always pleasant. We first came here and met Lino (the owner/manager/ruler of the taco kingdom) when we made an appointment for a tasting for our upcoming wedding. After we had the food, we obviously chose them as our caterer. We haven't had our wedding yet, but Lino has been extraordinary in providing his time and services to this sometimes-neurotic bride.  In the restaurant, staff is always attentive but not bothersome. They always seem to know just when you need them, popping up right beside your table to help with whatever.   The food is great! Being from CA and used to being surrounded by Mexican anything, this place sometimes reminds me of being there. Like I said before, their pastor tacos are great, as well as the barbacoa (lamb...and i hate lamb! Go figure) and steak. My fiancé likes the Tacuba Platter, which he says is tasty and filling.   Great food, services, environment, and prices!"}
{"text":"Boring.  This place was recommended to me by several people.  And I want to stop talking to them now.  It was a complete let down.    First, of all, the prices?  What?! Three tacos, rice and beans $9?  No thank you.  Second, the tacos were $1.50 extra if you wanted cheese.  Then it was mozzarella cheese?  Gross.  If I wanted mozzarella, I would eat Italian.    Third, the food was ok.  Nothing special.  Nothing amazing.  The salsa they put on the table was sweet and hot.  No one wants to eat that.  I had chorizo tacos and they were just ok...just ok.    This is what Mexican food is for people who know nothing about a good taco.  Harsh?  I know.  But the truth is the truth.  And my tacos were terrible.  I have used \"ok\" probably about twenty times during this review.  It got two stars because the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Tried this place out recently and found the food to be fresh but not a lot of flavor.   The hot sauce was very good though.   The chimichanga was the best.   The Tacos and burrito were ok but the chicken was a little dry.  I would go back to try again.  The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"El Pastor is sweet. Their chorizo tacos are really good on ala carte for $2. Either get flan or tres leaches cake for dessert. Their prices are very reasonable and employees are overly friendly. No drama happy place to go"}
{"text":"I am constantly on the search for great Mexican in the Madison area and I was needless to say based off my 1 star, a little let down.  Nothing special that I could put my finger on with this hole in the wall.  I ordered my usual, hoping for a great steak taco topped with some true Mexican cheese, and I was given something nothing close to what I wanted.  El Pastor, you are claiming to be authentic Mexican right? Why are you not using authentic Mexican cheese and spices? Unacceptable. Not to mention, the steak sucked. Not flavored at all. Straight up tasted like it had been cooked hours before serving. What are you trying to pull here? There were like 3 other people seated and it was 2pm on a Saturday. Take the time and grill me up some fresh steak. Not cool.   I don't even know if I should start with the mess of beans and horrible rice thrown on my plate. Seriously, take some time and make it look nice. But I guess if it ends up tasting like it did (horrible), it might as well look the part too.  Overpriced \"want to be Mexican food\" is what I call this.   I was told by a work friend that this place was pure Mexican food heaven, and now I have to look this person in the face and say, \"Your taste in Mexican food sucks\".  Thanks El Pastor, you have made a soon to be awkward moment for me!"}
{"text":"I've felt like a fish out of water for the past year after having moved to Madison from Southern California...true Mexican food was nowhere to be found. But today we found El Pastor and felt like we were home again! Forget Tacos Guadalajara and keep driving south for the best Mexican in Madison. Their torta de bistec put a huge smile on my face. Affordable with friendly service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Flavor is excellent. But their portions suck. Smallest burrito in town. I'm probably going to start going elsewhere for Mexican.  Update: needed to bump up my review, 2 is a bit rude just for a small burrito. When I order from El Pastor I just ask for extra beans in the burrito and they oblige."}
{"text":"Amazeballs!!!! I stopped in after driving by and thinking Mexican sounded good. Boy oh boy am I ever glad I did!!!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch and wow!  Dad had Pasole and I had Menudo, both dishes are difficult to get in restaurants and if on the menu are rarely very good.    Both dishes at El Pastor were wonderful and huge portions.  Really good, well prepared and very traditional.    I have had more typical fare here in the past and it's been pretty good but the soups wowed me today.  Keep this one in mind for traditional home cooked Mexican comfort food."}
{"text":"Outstanding service! I liked the carne burrito, rice, beans and delicious guacamole! Try the mango margarita! It's delicious! I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I'll admit that every single time I've been here, I've had the huevos rancheros, which are amazing and only $5.99.  The rest of the menu could be garbage, but based on bites stolen from my wife's plate, I doubt it.  Of those swiped bites, the enchilada sauce has been the best.  The menu is pretty expansive for a small place, and I plan on getting around to the tortas and stuff sometime soon, as soon as I can pry myself off the huevos.  If I had to pick on one thing, their canned beer prices are a little steep.  $3.50 for a Tecate?  Enh.  But the food more than makes up for it, and I only order a beer once in a blue moon anyway, so I'm over it.  More huevos, please."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos in town.  No frill restaurant that serves up great food at great prices.  Love their pastor taco as well as their chorizo tacos.  Very clean but sparse restaurant"}
{"text":"I've only been here for dinner. Not sure what they offer for lunch. The menu is the perfect size, but I miss the menus with a bunch of combinations listed. Both times I have ventured here I ordered Enchiladas. The first time Green...the second time...Red.  DELICIOUS Enchiladas. The chicken is perfect and the cheese is the right amount. The chips and homemade salsa are also good. You have to ask for refills though...  The best thing ever though..FLAN. Get the FLAN. Every single bite was so good. I didn't want the flan to disappear, but I shared it with two friends. We should have each ordered our own. GET THE FLAN. I am shouting it out loud now--- best FLAN I have had in a long time.   Service is great-- attentive. Food is hot. I'm definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"I visited El Pastor a few nights ago and was a bit disappointed.  I had bookmarked it based on a few reviews and finally found the time to go for dinner.  I ordered the chicken fajitas which are usually a hit in most places.  I don't know what it was but I didn't really enjoy it.  I think maybe it was because there wasn't really a Mexican flavor, who knows.  Either way, the fajitas were def not a hit.  I will be back to this place though.  They have a large menu and it's possible that I ordered the one bad thing on the menu.  Also, they have a bar; one that is separate from the actual restaurant.  I can't discount this place until I've truly experienced their bar.  Only a monster would do that and I'm no monster!  I would give this place 2.5 stars for now but look forward to updating my review after another visit."}
{"text":"We have ordered takeout here a couple times and the food is good.  We decided to get drinks and appetizers at the actual restaurant the other night but it was not great. The service was good, and again the food was good. But there is nothing really special about the food to put it over the top. I will say that the house made salsa was very good!  Also, while you get a lot for your money with the drinks, we were disappointed to find that they use store bought mixers for their margaritas and pina coladas. While I do hate blended drinks at bars, the pina colada was pretty good. We got the margaritas on the rocks but I think blending them would've been a better option to help the mixer blend with the tequila. We really just wished that they made a house margarita mix because it would've been a lot better!"}
{"text":"Worst Steak Tacos...EVER.   Tasted like marinated cardboard served in newspaper. Really and I don't normally give restaurants bad reviews."}
{"text":"Very nice! We went to lunch. Great deal. My soup ( huge bowl ) was excellent. The service is very friendly and fast. Small restaurant for mex food lovers."}
{"text":"My roommate and I were craving some Mexican food, so we decided to come here on a whim. To be honest, the location and the parking lot seemed a little sketchy at first but, at the risk of sounding (like the) hipster (I am), sometimes that can lead to more authentic eats.  I was really happy to see that they had lengua (beef tongue) tacos here because, to me, that's usually an indicator that the place isn't too Americanized and because I just love beef tongue tacos. I ordered the taco dinner combo, with lengua tacos of course, and it came with sides of rice and beans as well.  Once we ordered, chips and salsa came to the table and I was again pleasantly surprised that the salsa here was not mild. My expectations were growing.  Unfortunately, our food took a little while longer to come than we expected. However, our server was very friendly and apologetic.  When the food came, it was pretty good. Nothing too mind-blowing, but it was tasty and satisfying for sure. I liked the beef tongue but I also felt like there was too much onion on the taco that it crowded out other flavors a little bit (I just took some onions out and it balanced out fine). The beans and the rice were both just a tad bit too dry--I think my dish was sitting around while my roommate's dish was being prepared.   All-in-all, this is a good Mexican eatery and I would be happy to come back here again."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend to grab dinner and we both enjoyed it. Tacos come with a side of beans and rice which is nice. You can also mix and match if you're feeling like you want a little bit of everything. The Pina Colada was delicious -- and it was a great price. Very friendly wait staff and really great food for a good price."}
{"text":"I love this place. Seems family run since I always have the same waitress and see the same guy in the kitchen and the same lady doing office type things. I love their salsa it's different and I'm not sure what it is but I love it. They also bring a red bottle of spicy sauce with your meal and that stuff is good! I like to ask for the red bottle right away and mix it with the salsa to add some heat! Their queso dip is decent and I love the flautas, burritos, chimichangas, nachos, omg I haven't had anything here I don't like! Oh and I always get at least one margarita with my meal! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love tacos. Plain and simple. And that is how I like my tacos too; plain and simple; your taco meat (or vegetables for you non-animal eating people) with onions and cilantro. El Pastor gives it to you just like that. The tacos I ate yesterday were a 4-5. That is the truth. I was hungry and I wanted tacos. They themselves were brilliant. However, if I am going to rate the entire overall experience I am giving my experience from yesterday a 3/5. Maybe it was because I was crabby from being up until 4 am, but I felt like I was waiting for an eternity for my food to arrive. When I arrived to El Pastor we were seated but it took a while for our waitress to come greet us, and I actually believe it was the host that eventually came back to take our drink order and not even our waitress. For 2 pm on a Sunday afternoon, there were people in there but not enough people in there for me to have to wait as long as I did.   I do believe my linner? Lunner? (lunch and dinner?) was the same as the man-friends. I think we both had the pork, chicken, and chorizo tacos. Bless those tacos. I would bill the chicken tacos as my least favorite of the three yesterday with the chorizo being the stand-out star. It was spiced beautifully and served at a perfect temperature. It was slightly more charred than what I would have liked, but hey, it was still pretty darn good.   Will I be back?  Duh.  But will it be anytime soon? Probably not, as I am hearing of this new taco hot-spot on the east side that I believe needs to be checked out soon."}
{"text":"This was our first attempt at finding a good mexican restaurant in Madison.  The chips and salsa weren't great.  The salsa didnt seem very fresh but had a good kick.  I had the enchilada plate (one chees, two chicken with red and mole sauce.  My wife had the torta.  We also had a taco pastor, chile relleno and cheese quesadilla. The enchiladas were horrible.  really nothing else to add about that.  the rice and beans were pretty good though.  Torta was excellent.  the taco was a little on the dry side and the relleno had very little spice.  cheese quesadilla was good, but it is pretty tough to screw that up.  The nite we were there they had $1.25 draft beer.  that was nice!! In the end, I will definitely be trying other Mexican restaurants before going back."}
{"text":"Have driven past this place a few times now. Figured today was be the day I try it out.  Have a bunch of work to do, so I got it to go. Menu looks pretty standard. Service was nice and prompt.  Food looks great. Pretty hearty portions."}
{"text":"Yes , it is better than other Mexican restaurants in Madison. But please don't expect the most authentic stuff. It's good food, but there isn't so much I can rave about.  OK margarita, ok tacos  - the meats on the tacos were little on the dry side, and I wished they had more homemade salsa rather than the bottled hot sauce.  Good volume on plates."}
{"text":"El Pastor has consistently good food. Comfort food for me. I've had their tacos, quesadilla, salad, beans, rice, enchiladas, torta and many other items on their menu. Chicken or beef is my favorite. Mix and match for a custom plate. They have 5-10 lunch time specials too. Try the horchata. It is delicious. I keep saying that I want to try their flan, but usually I'm stuffed after the chips and salsa (3 kinds available) and then the meal. I should stop in one day for the flan and a horchata."}
{"text":"TacoQuest 2013 hits a rough patch  Needing to grab a quick bite to eat before heading out of town for my daughter's basketball game, I dropped by El Pastor for some carry out nourishment.    I ordered a trio of tacos: the pastor, the lengua and the aguacate.  The verdict:  Exceedingly average.  While better than the slop served by Taco Bell, it is well below the quality of the tacos I have recently enjoyed at America Latina or Los Gemelos.  The $1.99 aguacate taco was a big tube of goo and impossible to eat on the go.  It was a puree of avocado and refried beans topped with lettuce, tomato and onions.  Any attempt to pick it up would result in the unsupported end dumping the contents on my lap. Even with a healthy dose of salsa, this dish was bland and uninspired.  The $1.99 lengua taco has had numerous flaws.  Unlike the aguacate taco, there was a great deal of textural contrast, but not in a good way. While most of the meat was tender and well seasoned, every other bite yielded a morsel that had the texture of well-chewed bubble gum, not what I wanted to encounter on my virgin foray with beef tongue.  To make matters worse, the roughly diced onions that topped this taco had an extremely sulfuric taste that overpowered the rest of the dish.  The last problem I had with this taco was how it was packaged for my carryout order.  It was double wrapped in paper and foil, so the corn tortillas were well steamed when I opened up the packaging and they disintegrated when I tried to pick it up.  The one positive was that generous amount of meat filling.     The $1.99 pastor taco was the best prepared of the three tacos, but that was the only thing going for it.  The pork filling was generous in quantity and but again under seasoned.  I did not detect any of the pineapple that usually provides an accent to this dish. The salsa I received with my order did not help things out much.   It was similar to the bottled salsa I find at the local Piggly Wiggly (and that is not a good attribute for a Mexican restaurant).    Since this was a carry out order, I cannot comment about the service, other than the hostess was courteous and my food was ready to go within five minutes of ordering it."}
{"text":"For those of you who complain Madison is bereft of Mexican food, I instruct you to check out El Pastor.  It's amazing authentic food where you will probably have to know at least minimal Spanish in order to interact with your server. Get away from downtown, and go here."}
{"text":"HUITLACOHE!!! HUITLACOCHE!! THEY HAVE HUITLACOHE and it's delicioso.  Otherwise known as corn-fungus, this is a delicacy I have only learned about in my foodways courses and read about in the pretentious Gourmet magazine.  It's damn delicious in quesadilla form.  Subtle mushroom-like base w/ a slight touch of acidity and an even slighter touch of garlic.   Their melt-tender lamb barbacoa was rich and satisfying.  The orange cake my friend ordered was much the same -- it had fresh rind and icing layers so thick and fluffy. that I had to do everything in my power not to stick my fingers into it."}
{"text":"Whenever I try out a new Mexican restaurant, I always get a Chile Relleno because this reflects most accurately to me the quality of the kitchen.  Too many places just put some fake cheese on a bell pepper and hope you don't notice.   Let me say it was a solid chile relleno. Great melty queso oaxaca, the poblanos had just a touch of heat, and the eggs were stiff enough to hold up even though I got it to go! Good stuff and freshly made.  The easy part is what they messed up though! I got an al pastor burrito and was very disappointed.  Al pastor should be nice and crispy, like it just came off the trompo. This meat though, was likely sitting in a serving bin under a heat lamp for hours.  Too bad after such a promising start."}
{"text":"Literally the only reliable, consistent, actually good Mexican food in Madison. Yeah yeah you heard Taqueria Guadalajara was good - only by Wisconsin standards. I'm from LA and have no problem telling you I have cried over Madison's Mexican food. Tacos should be $1 and taste like heaven. Burritos should be $5 and change your life. Onions should be carmelized in meat fat and grabbed by the tongful to put over beans, rice, and directly in my mouth.   Pastor is sliced off of a spit, or it's garbage not worth messing with.   If you haven't gone to El Pastor and you think you're getting good Mexican food - you have been misled. I'm so sorry."}
{"text":"I've eating here a few times with mixed results - anywhere from \"meh\" to \"excellent\".    My last visit here brought a lunch burrito to my table.  I went with the steak because it sounded good and I was feeling beefy.  No ground beef option, so steak was it.  I'd say it was just \"okay\".  Not a great flavor like I'm used to from El Pastor.  I expected it to pop more, but it was pretty bland.  My lunchmate had a quesadilla and she didn't finish it, so I'm assuming it wasn't great either.    Past visits provided me with better food - more of the authentic Mexican food that I was expecting this time around.  I'll eat here again, but I won't be as excited as I was before this last visit."}
{"text":"Bad service. Ok food. I had their shrimp Mexicana. There's barely any shrimp in it. Way expensive for the food."}
{"text":"This is the best and most authentic Mexican food I have had in Madison. I had a burrito (the \"medium\" size was huge!), and split a chile relleno with my friend. He had a torta with their el pastor (pork) on it- everything was super good! I have found my place for Mexican food. Muy bueno."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison. The feel of the place and the food seems very authentic. But it is also just damn good."}
{"text":"Service was fine but the food was pretty mediocre. I had the verde enchilladas and they were just rather meh. Too much cilantro and otherwise rather bland."}
{"text":"We've had dinner there 4 times and never had a bad meal. Prices can't be beat, service is super fast and friendly and the place is spotless."}
{"text":"Had the marinated pork burrito.  The pork was very good - juicy and flavorful.  The rest, however, just wasn't good.  The tortilla was noticeably sweet - an interesting touch, but it just didn't work with the rest of the ingredients.  Rice was a bit acrid, as well.  Despite the good reviews I've seen, it's unfortunately a place that I probably won't be going back to."}
{"text":"Amazing! I tried the Chalco combo platter and it was so delicious. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times in the past year.  Just realized we haven't left a review.    Everything here is just so good.  We have had the burritos, tacos, chimis, desserts, and a few other dishes.  Always good.  The ambience is casual and close.  Friendly staff.  Just one of the best places to eat in Madison.  Don't pass it up."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison. I love the pozole it is almost as good as the stuff my grandma makes. I also like the tostadas."}
