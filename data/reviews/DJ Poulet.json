{"text":"The awesome food and staff at DJ Poulet make having a meal an outstanding experience! They are truly masters of chicken and know how to cook an above average bird. I had fun at the restaurant and highly recommend trying the plantain!"}
{"text":"Wow. This succulent chicken is the wowest chicken ever. Everything here is amazing. They have a limited menu which was the first indication to me that I was in for a treat. They serve five things, five wonderful things. 

I'm excited this place is just a couple blocks from me while I'm in Montreal because it's perfect for when I want to get dinner to bring home. 

If I we're forced to choose, I'd say the red rice was the best side. It was fantastic. 

Yum."}
{"text":"Juicy chicken! Not portugese! Good price and great service!"}
{"text":"Had to give DJ Poulet their first yelp review!! Menu is super simple here which makes deciding on what to get fast and easy. Any quantity of chicken includes 2 delicious sides. Staff is smiley and welcoming. Definitely a bargain for the quality + quantity you get. Definitely recommend checking this place out!!!
