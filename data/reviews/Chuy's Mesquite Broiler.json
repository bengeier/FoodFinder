I order the  chicken ala-cart.  I was very surprised at what I got.  They brought me a basket with one piece of chicken breast cut in half.  I asked the server if that was right.  He said the cook had \"weighted it out\".  I said it was suppose to be  of a chicken not  pound.  I paid $7.64 for one piece of chicken and a glass of iced tea."}

{"text":"Chuy's was pretty good.  Seems like all of their locations are pretty similar.  I think they'd be best known for their cheap margaritas... $2 pints, $4 small pitchers.  They aren't too strong and come from a mediocre mix, but if you're looking for something sweet and cheap its a good bet.

Free serve-yourself chips and salsa are pretty good.  

As for food... pretty decent prices and okay to good food.  I wouldn't say its authentic Mexican, actually I think the menu is a bit confused.  But the food is good overall.  It's a place we'll go to every month or so."}
{"text":"Go here often.  The food is good and inexpensive.  The chip and salsa bar is a nice touch.  The place could use some updating but that isn't why I go."}
{"text":"Meh.

Another day that I couldn't stand cooking and didn't want to fork over $20 for takeout. Searched \"cheap\" and found it. This place is seriously cheap, from the chicken to the tacos to the mermaid barbies with shells glued over their, erm, non-boobs.

We missed happy hour but still fed three of us for $11. - a quarter chicken platter (because Derek R.'s review assured me it wouldn't suck), a tri tip burrito, and of course the salsa bar. The chicken tasted like it had been sitting in a bucket of citrus-ey marinade for a few hours and was then grilled... it was edible at best. The tri tip burrito was actually pretty awesome though, I'd go back for one of those.

The restaurant itself was cute in a \"whoaaa mannnn\" sort of a way, I feel like I could get smashed there and they wouldn't care. I was originally going to leave a 2 star review, but I upgraded it to \"A-OK\" because of our \"server\". The table was so insanely sticky that when she came to drop off our food, I moved my New Times and the back cover ripped right off and became a permanent fixture to the table. We laughed, and the waitress said \"Now you have a placemat\" and stuck my plate right on it. Awesome."}
{"text":"If you're like me, you go to Chuy's for:

-cold Dos Equis on tap.
-tortilla soup when you're feeling under the weather.
-free salsa and tortilla chips.

Overall, I enjoy this place quite a bit, especially since it's only a mile or so from my house. If there's one thing on the menu to avoid, it's the burgers...they're often overcooked, and I find it odd that the cheese for cheeseburgers is served shredded and on the side."}
{"text":"I had the California tacos. The salsa was really good, but the tacos were sub-par. There are too many other good restaurants in the area to waste your time here."}
{"text":"I almost always get the fish salad and it's the fucking bomb. If I had 3 wishes, I'd wish that I could have this for lunch, every day, forever. They have cheap margaritas and a funky beach atmosphere that makes me feel like the ocean is just beyond the open patio windows. But then I'm slapped with the reality that Target is over there and we live in the desert. Ha anyways, it makes me kinda sad that every time I go in there, it's totally empty! EDIT: Apparently the owner, his son and their accountant got arrested for tax evasion today. Sucks they had to go and do that! I want my freakin fish sally!!!!! :("}
{"text":"Chuy's food is as great as it usually is.  When I lived in Ca, I Chuy's was a regular haunt because the food has need awesome since the original days.  But the service at this particular resturaunt is inexcusable.  One person was given the wrong food.  Mistakes happen... But the manager (who made the mistake on the order) refused to fix it, and actually insisted the person in our party that got the wrong food ordered it that way.  Her argument was that the customer ordered a dinner they hated and she was not going to fix it.

Great food, when they get the order right.  But service is so bad, you will be best served going elsewhere."}
{"text":"how is this place in business?  the only thing good I can say about it is it was soo bad it made us leave and we found an amazing place!  no names mentioned, but you can read my reviews.

service was non-existant and the place was not well kept at all.  We left after one short drink.  Too much wrong to list...just skip this one."}
{"text":"Here's the deal...Prior to Moon Valley Grill opening at 6:00 AM this was the only game in town for an 8:00 AM blood marry.  The early opening time and $1.50 blood bar are what first attracted me.  I've continued to go back because the Mexican food is ridiculously cheap and in my opinion pretty good!

The Good - Drinks, Food, Prices

The Bad - Service, Atmosphere, Clientele

The Ugly - The bartenders"}
{"text":"This isn't a restaurant that is going to impress anyone, and it is part of a chain, but it is reasonably priced and delivers reasonable food--not a bad place to grab something to eat.

I find the grilled chicken salad a good eat, though I normally go for the half size to skip the grilled tortilla bowl (never have liked those much).  I also like the beef or chicken sandwiches."}
{"text":"I have been here several times because I have met the owner, liked the food and drinks are very reasonable. 

However-I went last weekend with family which included 5 of us with children. We ordered and for the first time were very disappointed. I was so disappointed that I complained about my 6 year olds dinner (Nachos). Mind you I cannot recall when I actually lodged a formal complaint with an establishment regarding a food issue.
The child's dinner consisted of very large portion of average tortilla chips in a bowl with a skimpy amount of cheese sprinkled over the chips and heated with a micro-wave. Very little cheese had melted, most of the cheese fell to the bottom of the bowl and the meal was horribly disappointing. 

After complaining about my son's $4.99 child meal (stretch on the word meal) on a total bill of $54, I was politely told that there was nothing the management could do about it. 
I however can do something about it. 

     - I tipped the waitress poorly to represent the overall service.

     - I left vowing never to come back.

     - I am writing this review for your convenience to pre-warn you to extreme disappointment. 

In the end I got the impression the owner (Tai - I believe) who was working in the kitchen, simply did not care. Almost like he was going out of business attitude and wanted every dollar today with no customer satisfaction regard for the tomorrows, kind of thing.

BEWARE!!!!"}
{"text":"Great placr. They have 10 different types of street tacos for 99 cents each & the best salsa/chips.

Shrimp & white fish tacos are the best.
Ask for baja sauce too"}
{"text":"Hubby and I live within walking distance and one of the reasons we bought a house where we did was because we could walk to Chuy's.  It's super casual and cool.  Super cheap and very, very good and fast.  We have not eaten anything at Chuy's we didn't like.  We have had the tri-tip plater, the california tacos, the tri-tip salad, the baja chicken salad, Chuys' famous chicken salad, the burgers & fries, etc, etc.  EVERYTHING is good, fresh, not greasy, and amazing.  The booths are in a bit of disrepair, but still comfy.  Not always the cleanest place in the world, but the pitchers are cheap, the food is delicious.  Love the casual, creative, and funky atmosphere.  We are originally from CA and take everyone who visits us here because it's soo good and fun.  Want a cheap, fast, great tasting meal?  Eat at Chuy's."}
{"text":"Update MAY 5 2011:
OH CHUY'S, HOW I WILL MISS THEE!!
Unfortunately for society as a whole, Chuy's didn't pay the rent and they've been closed down.  I tried to go 2 days ago and there's a sign on the door talking about a Landlord's Lien for non-payment of rent.

Oh well, time to head to Two Hippies instead. They do nice Taco's too.

------------------
Cheap Eats, Free Chips and Salsa, good $2 margheritas all day and night!  Did I mention cheap? My wife and I can usually eat well and both have a drink or two for less than $20 including a tip during happy hour.

I love this place - This is how a chain should be! Tasty food, feels local even though it's not and a staff that takes care of you without ever being in your face.
My heart has fallen hard for the broiled mesquite fish Tacos, or the chicken tacos. The broiled fish tacos are the best I've had anywhere. I generally stay away from the steak dishes because they aren't as good but I don't hold that against them. It's just that Baja California food is best served as fish or chicken, 'nuff said.
Here's a tip - If you don't like the rice they serve on a combo plate then you can usually substitute in an extra protion of beans or cabbage salad instead to keep it low carb."}
{"text":"This Chuys moved and is now just east of 7th St on Greenway Parkway."}
{"text":"Once upon a time I was a young lad with a powerful hunger for life and meat. I used to love going to Chuy's. Tri tip sammiches FTW I would have pronounced had FTW not still carried the Tupac meaning back when I liked it...yeah the good ol days. How the mighty have fallen.

After a trip to Ikea that went a bit too late to get my lingonberry fix, my companion and I were famished. One of the first places my navigation brought up in the area was  Chuy's. Hey right on, my generation digs nostalgia. 

The folks working were nice enough...I love the idea of serve yourself all you can eat chips and salsa, I forgot they have a bar, hey things are looking good....until.

I don't know if the stale chips just put me off enough to realize that Chuy's looks like my ex's parents bedroom after they refinanced their house to take out an equity loan in order to make their bedroom look like a Margaritaville restaurant. Parrot Heads. They did a half-assed job and so did Chuy's. It lacks the charm I remember the old Metro Center location having.

The chips were stale, the salsa was lame, the tri-tip was dry. The service was ok but apparently Wednesday night is the night to visit your buddy who works at Chuy's and get your drink on..I dunno maybe it's just short of payday and you couldn't afford your meds so this seemed like a good idea at the time. 

Point being I had to (got to?) listen to a loud conversation about a guy's terrible luck. He got pulled over speeding while hauling a trailer that he knew had no lights and got ticketed for everything he was doing wrong, Next day his wife got mad at him and busted a window in their house, later she burned his trailer down, ater again while \"partying\" he accidently hit the panic button on his friends house alarm causing the police to come to their rescue only to find 3 men with a pile of coke, entertaining a hooker. you aren't unlucky bro, you have bad judgement and worse taste in women.

Sigh. If you dragged me to Chuy's I would go I guess...maybe...for childhood Nathan's sake."}
{"text":"This place has something. It seems slightly worn and kind of has a beach-dive feel but it is so comfortable. It feels like a friend's house. The atmosphere is just so relaxed and kick-back. You walk up to the bar to order your food. This location has a great menu of specials so I've never even ordered off the regular menu. You get your drinks and head over to the chips and salsa bar. They have baskets out and you help yourself to as many chips you'd like. They also have this yummy seasoning you can put on your chips. Their salsa bar is more limited but still pretty tasty. You seat yourself wherever you'd like. Their food is pretty good...not amazing but it's just good. It goes with the atmosphere and I really enjoy eating here. It's very relaxing after a stressful day. You aren't hassled with waiters, it's a big place so you can sit in your own area and just enjoy. They have these chicken enchiladas that are soooo different. They are crispy but kinda soft since they're smothered in their delicious enchilada sauce. So much flavor and it has a sweetness to it. They are so unique. Like I said, the food isn't life changing but if you like a chill place to eat and hang out, just relax, try this place. You may find it really enjoyable too."}
{"text":"This was one of the places that when I first moved to Phoenix opened some doors for me.  It is still a favorite today!  

Coming from the Midwest I had no idea how good food from south of the border could really be.  Nor did I have any idea that all food Mexican food was not represented at Taco Bell.  I know.  Enter a new co-worker's invitation to Chuy's for after work cocktails and grub.  Wow!!

Other than opening my eyes, after living here several years I have even more appreciation for the level of value and taste Chuy's pulls off in the Valley.  Mesquite broiled anything is a no-brainer here.  All are scrumdidlyumptious in the form of tacos, skewers, plates, etc.  I also dig their take on Baja-style sides like slaw and whole beans, no lard.

I have heard they breakfast but have yet to get to it.  If they have dessert I know nothing about it, which is strange given my fixation on the stuff.

The beach shack theme can take a little getting used to as it fast casual, including the alcohol.  Oh, and they have margaritas.  Forget the one-offs.  Find a friend and split a pitcher!  The pitchers are smoking deals and strong.  There may have been an incident with a friend under a table at this location due to non-belief in the strength of their margaritas... I may have not been much help in this situation given I was sure the bathroom kept moving.


That aside they have great food specials, a zoo-like Happy Hour, a free chips and salsa set-up and good prices on beer.  I recommend studying the layout before your first drink, bringing an appetite and having an exit strategy."}
{"text":"Chuys is definitely a casual dining place.  It refers to itself as a mesquite broiler, but the food seems pretty standard Tex-Mex.  I remember going to the location near 28th Street and Indian School when I was a teenager and it was a similar decor...however the old one seemed more beach-like than, as Margaret said \"cheesy spray paint t-shirts from swap meet.\"

What I did like about the facility is that it was very clean, well lit without glaring light, and spacious -- the tables aren't so close that you hit the people behind you when you are getting out of your chair.  Why do some restaurants do that?  How can being constantly bumped be an enjoyable meal time activity?  Again though everything was clean.

Thankfully, we didn't get a stuffed animal marker.  The idea of having stuffed animals in a greasy food establishment is quite disgusting.  I only saw one table get one and it was a family with wee little children.

I am not a partaker of buffets since I am not a fan of having everyone who has come through a restaurant touching my food, so I wasn't excited about the serve your own chips and salsa.  However, the sneeze guard was so large I could hardly reach the salsa -- and I have long arms.

You do order your food at the counter and get your own chips, but the waitresses bring it to you and come by often to refill your drinks.

The food was good.  We got a quesadilla, fajitas, and fries/chicken.  The portions were good with one exception...there were minimal tortillas with the fajitas, not near enough for all of the fajita insides.

It definitely seemed like a place where everyone should be drinking!"}
{"text":"Chuy's is a bad restaurant and a worse bar that just happens to have great food. 

Chuy's seems to be a chain but they don't have a website and half the locations in town seem to have closed down lately. The faux mexican-cantina is kinda worn out and the floors and tables are always a little unclean. Luckily the food makes up for it a bit.

The tri-tip sandwich (get it on garlic bread) is amazing, and I'll come here at least monthly just for that dish.

If you stop by at happy hour they have cheap tacos which aren't bad and they have a couple beers on draft, but their house margarita is pretty lame (luckily its cheap!)."}
{"text":"Oh how I love a cheap pitcher of margaritas.  Then they hand you a stuffed animal to mark your table! What an interesting touch :)  Their complimentary \"chips and salsa\" bar is great as well!

Their mesquite fish salad was actually quite memorable.  Their bean & cheese tostada even more memorable (lard free beans too! - lard is such a disgusting word.)

I could do without waiting in line at the counter for a drink refills, but hey, it's all part of the experience!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at this Chuy's since 1996. The mahi mahi fish tacos are one of the best menu items. The chicken here is made fresh daily and charbroiled with a coal fire grill. They offer a variety of Mexican beers. I find the margaritas to lack luster and they taste virgin to me. Sad to hear that they will soon no longer exist as Chuy's......name change coming after being plastered all over news for having undocumented workers behind the scene. Everyone needs a job right?"}
{"text":"Why the hell does everyone have stuffed animals?!

Apparently, they give you a stuffed animal after taking your order so when you're seated, they know what table to deliver the food to. I thought it was a just a nice gesture so I said 'No thanks' to the dirty stuffed animal. Then I wondered why the food never came.

Chuy's reminds me of the surf n' turf taco shops by the beach. I like the meat and seafood options and especially the smell of grilled food but the flavor could use a lot more spice. The menu was expansive and offered a lot. Too much to list and I think they even have fried chicken? Weird. 

I ordered the Broiled Whitefish Taco Platter ($6) with a side of Shrimp Skewers ($4). The shrimp skewer was awesome, sprinkled some lemon juice on it with some hot sauce and that was a better meal than my taco platter. The fish didn't taste 'fresh\" and I'm not exactly sure what whitefish is either. The rice and beans were standard. The cabbage salad could use some help. It was chopped cabbage with a vinaigrette. 

I was not impressed by Chuy's but I could go there again. It's a safe option, maybe next time I should try their $2 margaritas that they serve all day, every day. Now we're talking!"}
{"text":"I'd been to another chuy's in Phoenix - it wasn't bad.  This place was.  Is it open?  Barely?

Bland beans, lukewarm chicken fajitas, and our waitress dropped the food and ran.  The only good things were the grilled pepper and onion on the fajita - the chicken must have been cooked a few days back and kept warmish.

My cutie had the mahi tacos and the bland watery beans.  She said the mahi was ok, but I say they were very fishy tasting.  You know - old fish.

Went in on a gamble since I'd been to one before and this is close to home - but as another reviewer said - NO DICE!"}
{"text":"Chuy's Mesquite Broiler is my new fave post-gym dinner haunt.  I heart the namesake mesquite broiled chicken. A  1/2 chicken + rice + ranchero beans + tortillas (corn or flour, your choice) + cabbage salad is $5.99.  Add in the FREE (yes, I said free and unlimited) chips & salsa and you're set!  The chips are not only free & umlimited -- there's an entire chips & salsa bar/buffet with like 4 kinds of chilled conidments including a delightful salsa fresca & my fave salsa (not sure what it';s called) that's like pulverized tomatatillos & it's super peppery.  They also have that curious carrot/pepper blend that's often found in SoCal & AZ.

Chuy's embodies SoCal/baja California cuisine -- right here in the desert.  They are a chain, not like McDo's -- with ~17 locations in AZ & 10 locations in Cali.  Each location is a little unique. I've been to about 3 of them in AZ and the food is consistently nom-nom-nom-a-licious and CHEAP.  I've been for drinks as well and the beers are cold & plentiful.  

I like the Indian School location b/c, well, it's close to me and the patio is awesome for al fresco dining and smoking is permitted out-of-doors, natch.  The staff is typically young, friendly ladies and I have  anew fan at the Ind.School location -- she freaked out (in a good way) when she saw my Jäger tattoo and told me I'm her new fave customer.  Nice!

The crowd tends to be baby boomer stoner & surfer types & younger folks looking to dine/drink on the cheap, but it's never rowdy and usually people are very friendly and oddly communal for a restaurant.  There is a sense of community around dining at Chuy's -- almost like the OG's slogan \"when you're here -- you're family\" -- it's like, \"when you're here  -- you're Chuy'n\".  (OK, I know that was bad, but I had too...)

The downsides: (if this is a downside to you) you serve yourself on the chips & salsa (buffets do NOT bother me) and you bus your own plates & cups after eating.  Big whoop.  Clean up after yourself -- it'll make your mama proud!  Also, the tables can be SLIGHTLY sticky at times...but randomly.  Everything else is top notch, so I give them 4 stars.

All in all, for the value, the amount of food and the friendly, welcoming atmosphere, Chuy's gets my vote!"}
{"text":"We ventured into Chuy's on Friday night, and didn't know what to expect. The decor is straight out of a cantina from any California boadwalk cafe. It offers pretty cool scenery with all the surf bbards and graffiti etc. 

The food - that's a different story, it' not that great. I had a Coors light from tap, it tasted old and flat, they needed to change to keg. Our food was California tacos fish, and steak was just ok, I've had way better. The only thing that I really enjoyed was the salsa n chips. So If I ever some here again, it would only be for the chips n salsa"}
{"text":"I popped in mid week and had the $4 pitcher of margaritas which equals about 2 glasses becauses its filled with ice. They very good. Also had the original wings and they were pretty good for being on the small side for $5 during happy hour.  Th sauce has a tiny bite of heat and the wings are crispy just like I want them.

It seemed to me that the place could be a great hang out.  And apparrently a few people have made it to the status of regulars and are known and acknowledged upon arrival and departure. The mesquite chicken smell draws you in from outside."}
{"text":"I loved Chuy's, their baja tacos will always be a fond memory for me.  This location is closed and probably will be forever.  They weren't playing by the rules.  Go across the street for some good eats."}
{"text":"We don't have a Chuy's back home and so we thought we'd check it out.  

Chuy fooey.  On the outside, it reminded me of an AppleBee's or an Outback setting where you sit down, get served, and chat with family for 2-3 hours.  Instead, think of this place as a fast food joint with the quality being similar to what you'd get at a carnival.

After my first 3 bites, I immediately knew, \"We should have ate at home.\"  The beans were equal to sloshing out of a tin can.  The rice remained dry despite adding ketchup.  And the tri-tip tacos that came highly recommended by the server were interestingly chewy yet watery.  Oh and how could I forget, the tortilla chips were so processed that each and every chip looked just like the other.

And the service . . . my, what a comedy of errors.  We got 3 menus for 5 people.  The server, who we thought was directing us to our booth, innocently did a U-turn to do something else . . . completely unaware that she just handed us 3 menus.  She eventually took our order but forgot to check-in on us AND forgot about our \"to-go\" order which was a blessing in hindsight.  She was hardly 20 years old and couldn't focus longer than 30 seconds or knew enough to cover her out-pouches of skin.  

Are there any pros you ask?  Well sure.  1)  They have a salsa bar with somewhat decent salsa on it, 2) and the most important one is that we don't have a Chuy's back home."}
{"text":"I love this place and have been eating there for years.  I love the fish salad or the tri-tip sandwich.  Even the roasted chicken is great.  The help your-self chips and salsa are great to munch on while you wait for you food."}
{"text":"Great place for a cheap meal. The food has always been great and the beer is relatively cheap. The atmosphere is not generic or too corporate. Try the fajitas or breakfast burrito; both are always great!"}
{"text":"I can eat here every day! Their chicken - the way it's done - just yum! I usually get a combo - chicken/shrimp w/rice and cole-slaw"}
{"text":"***Chain Alert***
This place is a chain, but it is a decent meal.  Yes, it is slightly over priced and the food isn't the greatest.  The atmosphere is a cross between Rubios and Joe's Crab Shack and the service is compareable as well.

I ordered the Fried Whitefish Tacos (see pics) and I got a little chips and salsa from the salsa bar. Here's how the meal panned out:

The tacos were Great!  The baja sauce was not the typical white sauce.  It looked more like \"Fry Sauce\" (if you're from Utah) but it tasted great.  I mixed it with a tablespoon of their Red Hot Sauce.  The beans were unmashed pintos which i prefer over everything except whole black beans. They were decent nothing great I mixed in a bit of pico de gallo to flavor them up a bit. The rice was horrid.  I hate to say it, but you know those grains of rice that aren't cooked?  The hard ones that break your teeth from the outside in? Yeah. Those were randomly encountered during consumption.  Not a pleasant experience. The portions were small but I didn't complain because the tacos were actually pretty good! They were crispy and you could tell they were battered and fried to order. Surprising!

The salsa bar was mediocre.  The Red Hot sauce was more vinigarry (word?) than deliciously hot, and the Pico De Gallo was made from canned tomatoes.  The chips were so old that by the time I got to them they were broken shards of their former selves. Pity, I was looking for a good chip pig out.

The service was very good.  The first waitress told me to seat myself and to come up and order at my convenience.  When I did, another waitress took my order promptly.  The wait wasn't long, it was about 5 minutes from ordering to receiving my food.  The tables were quickly cleaned and everyone seemed happy (the customers and the employees)  It was a very comfortable and pleasant setting.

Overall, this restaurant has the 'Meh' effect.  I didn't hate it, but I don't think I'd be back.

Constructive Criticism:
1. Add some order to the ordering process.  I was a little confused on where (and when) to order
2. Get rid of the stuffed animal order numbers.  Something about greasy food and fluffy animals says more of \"bacteria\" than it does \"uniqueness\""}
{"text":"They are back!  Menu has been tweaked slightly, but same great food, same so-so service, and a funky atmosphere.  I go for the food and it trumps all else."}
{"text":"I was dying for some Mexican food. Unfortunately I am surrounded by nothing remotely yummy enough. So I get my #1 to jump in the car with me for a scavenger hunt of yumminess (yes that is a word ;) 

We drive up north because of a review about \"life changing\" tacos. Alas, we could not find the darn place even though Google maps assured me I was on top of it!!! Frustrated but not defeated we jump on the freeway and head back to the old stomping grounds (cenPho). As always we somehow manage not only to find a place, but a GREAT place!!! 

So upon walking in, I felt like I should be in Cali.. The psycho colors and trinkets all over are awesome.!! 

Now to the food. I got the mahi tacos and #1 got the steak burro. We shared the shrimp skewer and I got a marg! 

Kids this stuff is no joke. It's so yummy! And the prices are ridiculously low. 

To top off all the wonderfulness (yes it's a word also ;) of this place ( the great food. cartoonish atmosphere. Service with a smile. Salsa bar. Endless chips.... I got a free Teddy bear! Well bunny actually !!! His name is Don Julio De Cervantes (see pictures) and is quite the cutie pie!

Go grab some grub. You will not be disappointed, I promise. This is one of those places where you want to try everything on the menu.

Enjoy!

{"text":"Tried this because of reviews from yelp I was not disappointed! The waitress was friendly and helpful! The food was hot and tasty! The prices were excellent! The only drawback was disposable plates and forks  but because the food was good and price was right can over look that! The restaurant is open and with the game on it was very loud, note to self try a day when no football is on! But it was a friendly atmosphere and everyone were enjoying the food, drink and game on multiple Tvs , will definately return and try other things on menu! I had the fajitas and husband had the enchiladas, both were good!"}

{"text":"After shopping all day, I wanted something pretty quickly and something that won't break the bank. Chuys was a good stop!

They offer good specials. I ordered to go and got the chicken fajita for $5 or $6 and it was good! They made it within 10 minutes or so.

The staff were very helpful and friendly! In addition, while you wait they have video game machines and the \"prize grab\" machine. It must have been a lucky night because my husband scored a stuffed animal for my niece. We all left pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I really like this place and have no idea why the reviews are so crappy.  If you people want Mexican food then go to a Mexican place.  If you want better quality chicken, go to Bandares or Houstons or the tons of other places that serve good quality stuff and don't bitch about the price or that its in Scottsdale.  While some places rip you off, you pay for what you get for the most part.  Anyway, rant over.

Chuy's is very good.  It is neither a Mexican or a chicken joint.  It is some sort of Baja cuisine that I don't really understand but I really like.

I don't really like the ordering process here.  There is no overhead menu so I'm always unsure where to stand to place my order.  Lucky for me, right when i walk in the door, a person is right there asking what I want.  Not 2 seconds after I walk into the place I already feel flustered.  I'm handed a menu and stand to the side to make my decision.  All I really wanted was 3 or 4 of their fish tacos because they are awesome.  I didn't want all the rice and beans and stuff that comes with the 2 taco meal but I couldn't find the single tacos on the menu.  Oh well....I settled on the tri-tip and chicken meal because I could feel everyone staring at me wanting me to place my order.  

I've gotten that same meal before and it is excellent.  Not the highest quality or the healthiest meal around, but I don't care...it is darn good.  You get a 1/4th of a chicken and a good amount of tri-tip stuff.  It's actually a good amount of grub.

As I was waiting for my order I found the single fish tacos on the menu.  Not worth like $3/taco but I'm for sure getting a few of those next time I return.  They are really that good.  Especially with their special sauce stuff.

The help yourself chip and salsa bar is also pretty good.  Above average I'd say.  Plenty of most-of-the-time fresh chips and plenty of most-of-the-time fresh salsas.  The salsas are ok but can use some more kick.

Anyway, yeah, the place is probably not so clean and everything is sticky.  There are also tons of random California junk lining the walls but that is all part of this place's charm.

There are a lot of Chuy haters out there but I don't care.  I will return."}
{"text":"I have to admit, my friends had to drag me to this Chuys location because the one on Cave Creek and Thunderbird is horrible. This location, however, seems to cook their food when you order it rather than once a month.
I had the Tri Tip tacos and they weren't bad...they weren't delicious either but I wasn't horrified.
The staff was pretty friendly and everyone I was with seemed to enjoy their meal."}
{"text":"I went with the \"famous sliders\", which were pretty decent.  Not high quality burgers, but not bad.  Chips and salsa were ok, and the fries weren't bad.  Their Chuy's brand barbecue sauce was surprisingly good - probably good enough to compete with the national brands (assuming it isn't already a re-label of an existing brand).

I don't think I'd make a special trip out there, but I'd probably consider stopping in again if the opportunity arose."}
{"text":"This was the most horrible for I've had in YEARS! I'm pretty forgiving but I can't forgive the junk they cooked here. Please don't go, you will be horribly dissatisfied...I went at 12:30pm on a Friday."}
{"text":"Chuy's is closed but this has reopened as C.C.'s same food and menu. $8 pitchers of margaritas are strong!! Great food for low prices."}
{"text":"Now we ate here twice this past weekend? Yes, twice! I had to make sure about their service, which is lousy! The first night, family and I had a quick dinner before our daughter had to work. I had the tri tip sandwich, mother had the burger sliders, and daughter had the cheese burger. 
FOOD! - I love tri tip, especially from Santa Maria, CA. I have yet to find a place just as good. Chuy's is alright, I ate it, I enjoyed it, but nothing worth writing home about. Wife did like their burger sliders a lot. Plenty of flavor. Daughter was not that impressed with the cheese burger. patty way to think, too much pepper.

Service! - It it wasn't for Ofelia! We might still be their waiting for our food or getting our check. I even requested for Ofelia to receive the tip!

Now, I enjoyed Chuy's enough to come back again, this time I ordered their pull pork sliders, daughter had their chicken strips, and wife had their tri tip tacos, and their chico tacos.

Again, I enjoyed their pull pork sliders, you do need to add BBQ sauce to them. They to tend to be on the dry side.  Again the daughter was not that impressed with the Chicken tenders, and their tacos were awful! no taste at all.

Now their service again was lousy! Their cook had to serve us the food? Never seen our waiter except when ordering? Had to walk up to the bar and asked for the check. 

The only reason I might come back is, the place is rockin on Friday night!"}
{"text":"food was ok. service great!!! need to work on the dry chicken"}
{"text":"Boy this place has gone down the can. We have been to the others but no diffence what a change over a few months. service is ok. Food bad. T.V.'s not updated chicken supper dry beef dry.not returning save you're money."}
{"text":"First one my wife and I went to. great food but what is going on with them service is great tables clean and food was great took the family we picked familly meal that was wonderful even had food to go. we went back and it boy has gone down hill hope they turn it around becouse I would love to go back. except cave creek one"}
{"text":"Sorry folks, Chuy's is no longer open at this location. It is now a restaurant called \"Bisquits\"' serving breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Chuy's has multiple locations throughout the valley and their food is consistently good tex/mex cuisine.  On my last visit, I ordered the grilled Mahi plate, which came with 4 good sized chunks of fish, 3 corn tortilla shells and plenty of rice and beans.

They have a help yourself salsa bar, with plenty of salsa options, as well as pickled vegetables, and a huge bucket of warm tortilla chips.  Chuy's is one of those places where you order at the counter, pay, and then some random employee drops the food off at your numbered table when ready.

The beer is always cold and the food and drink inexpensive, making Chuy's a great stop for a budget friendly meal where you don't compromise on taste."}
{"text":"Went to Chuy's 2 days after the re-opening.  New kitchen staff and cashiers. Service was awful, the cashier stated they were brand new, and it showed.  The food was atrocious, over cooked and the salsa bar looked like it had been sitting there for hours without being restocked with fresh salsa. The place was dirty and the whole vibe was a downer.  I've been going to that Chuy's for at least 4 years, but I doubt I will be back...."}
{"text":"I'm shocked at myself that I ate here, but it was a last resort due to me needing to take Adam to the airport.  I've been to Chuys in Tucson for dinner, which is always have had a good experience with it being that it is a total hole in the wall.  But did anyone know that they had breakfast?!  Well they do.  So we went in and weren't expecting the world knowing what the place was.  We sat ourselves because there was no staff in sight and just 2 older people at the bar, at 8am lol.  So we sat for a few minutes and then a girl came to us.  She got our drinks and then we told her we were ready to order and she said that they don't do table service and she would meet us at the register.  My mind was boggled because there were only 2 other customers in there who were done eating.  How could she not think that she should just take our order with ALL the time she had instead of making us walk ALL the way across the restaurant to place an order for a whole 2 burritos.  So I give her zero stars!  I give the burritos 3 stars because they weren't the best I've ever had but they were good enough and they didn't give me a tummy ache!  So I give a total of 2 stars because of the servers one star.

Chuys is always going to be a good choice for mesquite when you need a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Cheap beer great chicken and pork. They have a great $2 menu that is avalible all week including weekends. The pork here is great and so is the chicken. I would not go with the steak. Free chips and salsa, you cant beat that and you get your own so no waiting for the busy waitress to get them for you. Great margaritas and the beer is cheap. This is a great place to go and get a good for the money meal and a drink. Try the Baja Sticks!"}
{"text":"What happened to the friendly service and awesome margaritas?!?!!!  I will never go back after arriving at 8:30 p.m. and having the server dragging the trash can out the front  door and stack chairs on the tables and  at 8:45.  Come on! Really!?! The margaritas that were once so wonderful were horrible!  The manager used to come by the table to do a quality check...not this night... he didn't even glance our way even though the place was empty.  Shame on you for making us feel uncomfortable and rushed."}
{"text":"this is a decent little Mexican joint with a dash of American. Good burritos, chicken and fajitas. The free chip and salsa bar is nice and they have plenty of booze to choose from. 
I enjoy coming here on the weekends for breakfast as there is hardly anyone there and you can get a nice, filling burrito.
This location inparticular has it's regulars and the people that work here are always friendly and accomodating. 
I always feel comfortable eating here."}
{"text":"Second time here wife and I brought another couple this time. I had the Arizona burger again loved I so much last time had to have it again. Wife had chicken fajitas again she really like them last time we shared another Half pitcher of margaritas which is 2 1/2 glasses of marg for only $6. Other couple both had chicken tacos they both liked them. The only issue any one had was the beans were salty and rice was also. The other couple had a bottle beer and a half pitcher of piña colada all for $27. My wife and I spent $22. Also the bar is pretty much a full bar but with selection limitations so like they might have well vodka but not hammer an sickle vodka."}
{"text":"I saw there wasn't a listing for the new location, so I figured I'd add it!

Being a regular, I visit this place just about every Thursday.

The staff is excellent, while the tables can sometimes be a little messy, their are plently of napkins to clean up.

Their food is always great, the chicken can be a little dry sometimes, which is why I always get the grilled fish tacos, with a side order of hot shrimp.

Their salsa is excellent as well, and their beer selection is modest, but they have something for everyone.

This is an excellent place to go and decompress after a hard day of work."}
{"text":"It is with much regret that I give a 2 star review.  Me and Chuys go way back, like 17 years way back.  Many visits while in college in Tucson and then many a visit while living in Simi Valley, Ca.  Nothing but great experiences.  Now that I am back in AZ, I was longing for a taste of some old memories and went out of my way for a lunch at good ol' Chuys.  The decor made me feel right at home.  The tacky airbrushed paintings, silly wood cut out silloute booths and countless 5 star margarita propaganda.  I ordered my all time fave fish tacos and then headed to the self serve chips and salsa bar.  The chips looked a little stale, but I was in a forgiving mood.  However, when my meal arrived I was suprised not to see the tacos I was used to.  They tasted decent, but not what I was expecting.  My guess is that this location must be a franchise.  It was dead quiet during lunch, so obviously it isn't a favorite of the local crowd."}
{"text":"Great place to go for happy hour and Sunday breakfast. They have $2 build your own Bloody Marys all day Sundays. Breakfast is super cheap and tasty. Chuys also has one of the best strawberry margaritas I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"Quite very good lil' neighborhood joint. 

You order your food at the counter but they do bring it out to you. They have special for every day of the week! Like today its Tri-Tip sandwich, pretty nice. Their margaritas are honest and good tasting, and bunch of different kinds of beer does not hurt either. 
However, we came there for their $.99 street tacos and were not disapointed even a little bit - tasty, fresh, warm, jucy, delicious little things! \"I could be eating those whole day long, man!\" - Is what one of my friends said. \"When are we coming back?!?\" - Was reply from the other. 
I also had been there before on my own for dinner, and it was delicious. Fact that meet (fish) is broiled instead of fried gives this place an lot of \"Brownie Points\" in my book. Or maybe its cuz mesquite broiled Mahi is so good? Or was it pork? No, wait! It was salmon! Yes, for sure it was that. Unless it was white fish or chicken. Ahhhhh......... Screw it! I give up. its all flippin' good.

PS: Wait times are kinds longer then expected. BUT........ it IS worth it. However, i did dogged a star for that. There, now you know."}
{"text":"If I were a fat man, Chuy's would be one of the reasons why!  Crazy cheep drinks, big portions, and a free chip & salsa bar.  They have several big screen TVs so you won't miss the big game(s) either.  They have a real nice selection of beers on tap, and some of the best drink & food happy hour (3-7pm) specials in town.  If they add queso to the chip bar I'm moving in!"}
{"text":"Went here on a recent Friday night to catch the tail end of their happy hour  (3-6pm) for dinner.  A lot of other people had this idea too, because not only did we have to park quite a ways away, Chuy's was packed out and we barely grabbed the last table available.  

I had an order of two chicken enchiladas ($1.99), my wife had a quesadilla ($1.99) and I got a Baja Brew ($2).  With some guac on the quesadilla, and complimentary chips and salsa, total of less than $8, what a steal!  

I was mad when I had the chicken enchiladas...mad that I only ordered one plate!  They were delicious.  I think what put them over the top was the strong mesquite broiled flavor from the chicken.  They were also nice and crisp with a good amount of cheese and sauce.  The quesadilla was okay, nothing special about it, and the chips weren't super fresh.   The beer was cold and had a nice flavor to it.

It had been awhile since I had been here, but I'm going to try to be back again soon for those chicken enchiladas!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went He got the Cali tacos which were good but didn't really have a lot of taste. My BBQ sandwich was good but didn't come with BBQ sauce! The meat was really delicious and tender but the bun was really sogggy and greasy. The sandwich end up making my stomach hurt.  The portion size for both meals was perfect though. Overall probably won't go back."}
{"text":"No dice!

My family and I visited Chuy's on a Tuesday afternoon.  We recently moved to the Mesa area and wanted the opportunity to check out some of the local restaurants to see what was in the neighborhood.  

Upon entering the restaurant we couldn't help but notice how outdated the signs are on the wall, the decor looks beat up, and the place was dead.  I think one other table besides us was in the restaurant.  The waitress came up and told us we could sit where we wanted and to help ourselves to the free chips and salsa bar.  That sounded yummerz!  No dice again.  The chips were stale and the salsa was pretty so-so, but you couldn't even eat it with the chips being so awful.  Next came the service, or lack thereof.  We waited forever for our drinks, and I want to reiterate that there were only 2 tables in the restaurant; ours and another.  Finally the drinks came and she brought a pitcher of water to the table.  That was a quality move, and the reason why they got 1 star compared to 0 stars (I know you can't give 0 stars).  

The food was a disaster and everything looked like a punch in the stomach.  I felt like if I ordered anything from this overly deep-fried menu that I would be looking at a few hours on the pot or bent over clutching my stomach in the fetal position from the stomach ache it would give me.  Finally I decided to make the plunge and just go for it - a rancho style wet chicken burrito.  I figured I needed to give this place a reasonable chance to come out of left field and totally impress me.  Guess what?  No dice!

The burrito looked like grocery store Jose Ole brand, and like it was taken out of the microwave too soon.  I had a few bites and submitted to the painstakingly bad burrito.  My Mom ended up sending her food back, and my Dad, well, he'll eat anything.

Overall this place is NOT the spot for food.  I hear they have great drink prices and that it is a fun place to kick it and what not, but they should close their kitchen."}
{"text":"Chuy's is kind of divey but it's cheap and the food is excellent.  The margaritas are not bad either :)  I love the salsa bar, which offers you a variety of salsas and spices to put on your chips.  I also like that, though you order at the counter, the servers still bring your food to you.  You can also open up a bar tab and don't have to pay up front if you plan to order more later."}
{"text":"This place seems to have quite a following, since it has been here since I was a kid.  Sorry to be a hater, but I am not going to be one of those devoted followers.  We drove past it today and thought, you know, after all these years we have never eaten at Chuy's, so we decided to give it a try.  Walking inside, the interior is reminiscent of a divey beach bar, except you are in the middle of land-locked Arizona.  Chips and salsa are off to the side and free for the taking.  We placed our order of a burger, enchilada combo plate, and cheese quesadilla, and dug into the chips and salsa.  The chips were pretty hard, and not very appetizing, but since they were free, hey who am I to complain.  When I received my burger it was: 1.  Not the right burger I ordered, 2. Not very good since the meat was very dry and bland.  All in all, the burger was $7.49 which came with fries, and was very uninspiring.  The enchiladas were better, albeit a bit salty, and the cheese quesadilla was decent.  Maybe if you come here for their very cheap drinks it would be worth it, but for me I'd rather go to a better place for Mexican food or burgers."}
{"text":"Chuy's is a chain and there is nothing surprising about it, it is cheap and decent mexican food. This particular loaction has a great staff. They are always friendly and chatty. 

Things that are cool~
They give you a stuffed animal instead of a number. That just cracks me up, so instead of the runner looking for number 23, he looks for the purple crocodile haha. 
They have a salsa bar, the tomatillo and pico are both pretty tasty. 
They don't put lard in their beans (eat up).
The fish skewers and shrimp fajitas rock.
Matthew K. may be there all hot and dirty"}
{"text":"So many hours clocked in here I can't begin to imagine the number. When I followed a low carb diet I ate lunch here mon-fri almost everyday for a year and a half. When I say the chicken is consistently good I speak from experience.

Most of the staff has remained the same over the years. I've never had a bad experience service wise. All of this equates to a decent sized following of locals. You can expect to see many of the same faces in there for lunch and happy hour.

They have very good happy hour food and booze specials.

Chicken, tri tip, white fish, shrimp, lobster tacos, fajitas.. its all good. I haven't had anything here I wasn't happy with, excluding maybe the quesadilla.

All the meats are mesquite charbroiled and very tasty. The parking lot smells amazing all the time.

The chicken is very heavy on the black pepper and garlic. Their marinade/rub is put all over the chicken and under the skin as well at times.

They have a nice salsa bar with at least 4 different types of salsa plus spicy pickled jalapenos and carrots. Their chips never seem to be overly greasy and are surprisingly fresh for sitting at the salsa bar under a heat lamp.

I'm also a fan of the wings. They are nonstandard as far as the wing sauce goes but they are a nice change from the standard franks/butter.

When it comes down to it its solid food at a reasonable price. You can't ask for much more for a regular day lunch experience."}
{"text":"Yup.. still good!


It saddens me not to see this place with more customers. I had a nice time playing pool with my father, enjoying a tasty mug of beer with him and some chicken taco's.

One suggestion for the owners/ management ..


Your large blue sign on the wall needs to be updated, or taken down.. Having nothing on it makes it look like you have gone out of business, more so when the management company for the complex has an \"available\" sign right out in front of your restaurant as well.

Tell them to move the vulture sign somewhere else!


Ill be back for some tri tips next week!"}
{"text":"They have re-opened and the food is still decent. I had the broiled mahi mahi and it was fresh and delicious.

They will be changing the name of the restaurant but the menu will remain the same."}
{"text":"For what this place tries to do, it does it pretty well.  A laid back, beachy, surfer, baja style bar with broiled/grilled foods with cheap beer.

I find that on days when I am working on a big project around the house, getting all hot and dirty, I seem to gravitate here (maybe two or three times per year).   The food is average, but messy and filling so it makes up for the quality.     The beer is cheap and cold.  I saw that during happy hour they had $8 pitchers of domestic beers.

So when you are dirty and tired this place is fine for a quick meal and a few cold beers.
I"}
{"text":"Great service, order at the counter, nice specials, good standards, ok salsa and fun ambiance. I have just never had anything that wowed me or tasted \"just right\" so I gave it three stars."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go for a margarita and some Baja style mexican food.  The atmosphere is similar to a cantina in Rocky Point.  If you like Jimmy Buffet, and wish you were in Maragaritaville, this is the place for you.  Even if you think Jimmy Buffet is an overated hack, like me, it is still a relaxing, good place.

Pros:

It is a great meeting place for medium to large parties, because of its large indoor/outdoor patio layout.

Food and drinks are reasonably priced.  

Decent food, decent service (an order at the counter type place).


Cons:  

I have never witnessed a wet t-shirt contest here.

There aren't any street vendors selling sunglasses.

Jimmy Buffet beat me at arm wrestling here, so I am bitter."}
{"text":"Awesome meals, especially for the price. I was raving about that the entire meal. And I think I was a fan of the margaritas. I really couldn't remember or drive home."}
{"text":"Its name is now Baja Loco, we go for the cheese burgers and frys family really loves them also give the adults a chance to have a cold beer, they have a patio if you like but not the best veiws."}
{"text":"The beer probably helped, but I think I had fonder memories of this restaurant chain when I was in college.

I must be getting old...the decor says \"cheesy spraypaint t-shirts from swap meet\" and sort of a laid back eclectic.  I did like that they painted faux peepholes in the exposed a/c ducts with funny little characters peeking out.

What kind of lost it for me was that the place has just opened up and it looks kind of like a dump already.  I mean, I know it's supposed to be casual and beachy...but the booths already have butt-dents permanently ingrained in the vinyl.  

Crusty stained menu = Ew
Sticky floors = Ew
Sticky table = Ew
Stuffed animal order marker with food stains = NASTY

Upside was the food was decent and so were the prices.  But  why are there waitresses when you have to go to the register to order food, get drinks, and refills, and get your own chips and salsa?  They were nice, nonetheless...still...

Overall I just got a blah reaction.

I had way better fish tacos in San Diego."}
{"text":"Chuy's is one of those places that doesn't quite qualify as a dive bar/restaurant, but is close enough to count.  I like Chuy's.  It's like a mini-vacation every time you go.  Part beach bar, part pseudo-tiki (any place that has thatch palm fronds above the bar gets a star in my book!), you'll feel like you're on a beach somewhere every time you visit.  
It's nice to have one within walking distance to the office, to allow for a little exercise to and from and still have a good meal.  Their prices are reasonable.  I've been struggling to find a lunch under $10 these days, and the Tri-tip sandwich and an iced tea will set you back a ten spot and some change.  The food is good, did I mention that?  The staff is friendly, and they finally did away with the cheap-o' paper towels and put real napkin dispensers on each table...FTW!  
There's an unlimited chips and salsa bar, I like the cabo sauce the best for my chips.  I always add a little Baja sauce; you have to ask for it at the counter, to whatever I'm enjoying.  Today it happened to be the Tri-tip sandwich.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars because even though they have to-go cups, this is Phoenix.  It is 108* outside and the full glass of iced tea I left the restaurant with was gone by the time I got back to the office.  There should be a City-wide ordinance that all restaurants must supply patrons with at least a 32 oz. to-go cup during working hours.  All right, I confess that might be a little much.  The only down-side to Chuy's at lunch I've found so far is having to go back to work afterwards and not being able to enjoy a Corona with my lunch.  That's okay though, it just one more reason to go back."}
{"text":"Really great chicken.  I love their chicken salad.  ALWAYS great specials on food and margaritas.  I really like their mexican cole slaw and pick up 'to go' too."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Chuy's for years - ever since my college days in Tucson. This place is cheap and cheerful - what more could you want? The food is good (I love the California Taco's), the margarita's are fabulous (I love the strawberry one's and the regular one's are so strong they make me sweat!) and it's pretty family friendly. They have great happy hour specials during the week and a full bar.

You can feed 2 people for under $20 bucks and that includes a pitcher or beer AND margarita's. They have free chips, a salsa bar, and an ice cream dispensing machine to boot.

I've used Chuy's to cater corporate lunches before and it's a great deal if you need a lot of food to feed a group with a small budget. The only problem I've ever had with catering is that they forgot to give me my guacamole 3 times in a row...so check your catering order before you leave to make sure you have everything."}
{"text":"No mas pollo.
Went to this Chuy's location for lunch today and it is closed.

Note on the door regarding Landlords rights.

Never was a really happening location.  Not sure what the other stores are up to, but this location is done."}
{"text":"This Chuy's has moved to a brand new location at 830 E. Greenway.
Just East of 7th St. on the North side of Greenway.

You know why Chuy's is a great place?  The food is good, the service is good, the new location is clean and well lit.

Everytime I go there they smile and say Hello.  When I leave they say goodbye.  I actaully think they mean it.  

Chips and salsa all you can eat.
Margaritas are actually one of my favorites.
The new  \"Street Tacos\" are fantastic.
The beans and rice are healthy and taste good.

And my absolute favorite part... they open early 7 days a week.

Good clean service.  That's what makes a business successful."}
{"text":"My friend and I came to Chuy's this past Monday for the first time, since we heard that they had great prices on food and we were thinking to have maybe just one drink since we are seriously so poor now that it's not even funny. 

So we got there and I decided to get the \"5 star enchilada combo\" or something like that for $4.99. Good amount of food, but the quality was a little below average. \"You get what you pay for\" totally applies here.  

But let's cut straight to the chase: If you're looking to do happy hour right and on a budget, this is your place! $2 Margaritas and $2.75 for ANY Well Drinks (all tall glasses). And they're not stingy on the the alcohol :) . Great service too.  Our server was nice, attentive, and gave us lemon drops on the house. 

My advice: Come here for happy hour (Everyday 3pm-6pm) if you wanna get a lot of drinks for a good price.  But if you're looking for good Mexican food, you're better off going to Macayo's."}
{"text":"I am really surprised to see some of the awful ratings below.  Overall, it rates to 3.5 stars, but I think its better.  I wonder if any of these guys tried El Pollo Loco.  Last time I went to El Pollo Loco, I felt like I was eating salt.  Ever since I found Chuys in AZ, I am never going back to El Pollo Loco.  It is hard to compare Chuys to a classic Mexican or Grilled Meats place because it still has a fast food type atmosphere.  

I think its great they have a chips and salsa bar you can just help yourself.  Their salsa can be a little bit more spicier and flavorful, so this is why I give it 1 star less.  Nevertheless, their chicken is amazing.  I highly recommend paying a buck more for white meat chicken.  I usually get the half or quarter pound platter, depending on how hungry I am.  I can tell the food is fresh because there I times I take the food back and don't it eat for a few days, and it is still very juicy and flavorful after reheating it.

It is too bad some of the locations are closing down, but that is something I see a lot going on with other chains.  I think Chuys has to strategically choose better locations.  This one happens to be right next to Serranos, and Serranos is better by a mile, but the food is different style.  Price wise, Serranos is not that much more, so I am guessing more people go there."}
{"text":"Cheap eats in a laid back beachy atmosphere. You can easily feed a family of 3 for less than $20. I'm a big fan of the shrimp tacos and $1 make-your-own bloody mary bar on Sunday mornings. Fun, cheap place to hang out with a group of friends."}
