{"text":"Had a soup with beef and tofu. For 15$ i was surprised it came with a full big bowl of rice mixed with kimchi and sides. It was delicious! You get to mix the rice with all the ingredients and paired with the soup, I was in heaven. The tofu was super soft and meat was very plenty and tasteful. Extremely comforting meal. We also ordered raw beef that we usually like. Its very good! Best korean restaurant so far. So happy they exist."}
{"text":"Food: So-so. They offer a bunch of typically Korean items, along with some pot options to be shared between two. However, no banchan! T.T (how is this possible in a Korean restaurant?) Bibimbap is well assembled but the items inside are very ordinary. The tofu stew had 4-5 small tofu pieces inside and a few pieces of sad vegetables floating in a sea of red soup that only taste spicy with no taste. Also ordered chicken bibimbap here once, after I removed the deep-fried dough layer, the amount of chicken meat was less than 1/2 size of the total amount... =.=  Service: Fast, friendly  Price: Not worth it~  Ambiance: Homey style decor with wooden benches and tables. But I must say it's really dark inside, maybe to create an intimate feel but... really creepy..."}
{"text":"The soonduby w/ pork is amazing. I got recommendation from Korean college student here. Said never disappointed. Yes~~ I like their food a lot~~\"}
{"text":"It was ok, at Seoul Chako the meat is fresher.  The pancake and bibimbap is better at Lee Bong Nim."}
{"text":"I went there twice with large group of friends in the VIP room.  Big tables, couches, water you can fill yourself, KTV and big TV screen.  You pretty much go in the front and order when you want, pay, then they deliver the food when it's ready. Pricey for food and alcohol.  I tried the Chicken Katsu ramen. Dayum it was good. Always my Sapporo to accompany me during the night.  I had a great time singing and chatting.  The VIP room really makes a difference.  Staff is kind and always available at the front desk. Strongly recommend for big group gathering."}
{"text":"They offer a lot of options for food especially items to share, but the biggest problem with this restaurant was that the smell of the food really sticks to your clothing and your bags, etc. Their food is very tasty! Definitely eat their bibimbap with the sauce cause it's so good! Their portions are big which is good for some or not so much for others. The service was pretty bad. They didn't pay attention to our table at all even though we were right in front of the register."}
{"text":"This is one of the cutest Korean BBQs in the city. We were enticed in here one Saturday night by the big windows and delicious smells coming out of these windows (great marketing technique!) and were so happy to stumbled upon Sam Cha. Being avid Korean BBQ goers, we opted for the AYCE grill for two. This comes with the most delicious sesame salad, onions, mushrooms, pork, beef, short ribs, chicken and probably a couple other things I'm forgetting. Our favorites from the meat selection are the chicken and short ribs but all items are delicious. Service is good and they top up any or all dishes as much as you like. Only bad thing is that the table for 2 is definitely too small for the grill and everything else they bring to you which makes the experience a bit uncomfortable. Otherwise, yum and fun! What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"The food was okay (not bad but not great). There are other Korean restaurants that are much better.  The service was slow and the music was extremely loud."}
{"text":"Quality: 5 star Quantity: a lot better than other Korean's (a full bowl of bimbimbamp comes with hot stone soup, this never happened to other restaurant!!!)  Decor, staff and service: excellent!   They changed my mistaken order (my fault) without hesitation Recommend for Asian food lovers and couples!!!"}
{"text":"Korean comfort food, good prices and great service. All you can eat BBQ and yummy stews."}
{"text":"Sam Cha's Chicken Ramyun is to die for. What a blessing this place has been for me and my friends. We have made a tradition out of going to Sam Cha everytime we watch a movie at AMC Atwater.  I've had their Bibimbap which is the bets one I've had in Montreal so far. Packed with flavours and a suepr spicy sauce to compliment it.  But the showstopper are their Ramyuns. All of their Ramyuns are great but my favourite is Chicken Katsyu Ramyun. The Chicken strips are deep fried so their are multiple levels of texture. The broth is spicy (and by spicy I mean PoC spicy because I am South Asian and my level of spicy is pretty high). That being said, they control their spice level according to customer's taste (which we took advantage of and requested extra spice and wow did they deliver!). Super authentic taste. Fresh!! Best part is that their prices are affordable and really worth the value.   Staff is super friendly and accommodating and they make great recommendations. Go to this place for an amazing time!"}
{"text":"There's a korean bbq for 2 in their menu that was delicious! The bbq comes with 2 small soups, a salad and 1 big bibimpap to share. It's around $33 which I find worth it. I also tried their udon with bulgogi and broth was very tasty. Overall very satisfied with the service and food."}
{"text":"One of my fave korean places for their spicy tofu stew. The broth is amazing and thick and filled with ingredients inside. It also comes with a bibimbap so it's definitely worth the money.   The place is quite cute and cozy with some nice korean music and the staff is friendly. However, if you do go there, i hope you dont have an important meeting afterwards because your clothes, your hair and everything will smell like the restaurant during the whole day."}
{"text":"My favourite ramyun place in montreal. I always ask for the spicy seafood ramyun, it's actually spicy and  hot and full of flavours."}
{"text":"Bad service. Serving food slowly for a 2 hours limit buffer. Still hungry after the buffet. Added a 15% tips mandatorily without asking our feeling."}
{"text":"The best omg c'est tellement bouffe au top je vous conseil un de leur Soju cocktail et le dakgalbi omo omo omo the best je reviendrait serveur au top ambiance au top"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Their waitress was really friendly and accommodating, I could see her explaining the dishes to the people next to us, and she kindly assured me that they make their food when ordered so she can make anything vegetarian. Their portion for the rice and soup was great, especially for the price (I think it was about $15, but I'm not really sure). I initially thought it was going to be plain white rice with jjigae, but NOPE. I was super pleasantly surprised when it came with a bibimbap! My taste buds were raving. The only drawback was that the food took quite a while to arrive, about half an hour, hence the 4-star (the taste honestly deserved a 5). But it was understandable since they make it all from scratch. I would definitely go back again, you know it's good when you spend an hour enjoying every bite of your food"}
{"text":"Man, I can't remember the last time I so enthusiastically wrote a review immediately after a meal. I ordered the beef soondubu jiggae based on a few credible folks here and it really hit the jackpot! This spicy soft tofu soup comes with a broth that's so flavorful, rich, and well-balanced. The portion and solids in the soup are quite generous. On top of that, it comes with a free classic bibimbap :O I hereby proclaim this the most delicious and filling $15 meal in Shaughnessy Village!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times previously for the group all-you-can-eat BBQ in the back of the restaurant for a celebration. The party space is very cozy, with picnic style tables, dim lighting, and a 1 mic old-fashioned karaoke. Only recently have I tried the front area of the restaurant where I actually order dishes. I regret not having discovered it earlier. This restaurant has hands down the best soups (kimchi and soondubu jiggae) in town, and I've tried a lot of them. So flavourful, a lot of ingredients, a good portion, and just spicy enough. The only downside is that it comes with a dolsot bibimbap, which jacks up the price to 14$. You can however change the bibimbap for plain white rice for 2$ less. It is still more expensive than other places' soups, but it is worth it. I also love their spicy soup for 2 option, which comes on a stove that cooks its content right in front of you. There's ramen, kimchi, pork belly, sausage, mushrooms, bean sprouts and more. It also comes with a dolsot bibimbap. There is plenty enough food for 2 hungry people and it's only 30$. Strongly recommend (at least for the soups)!"}
{"text":"That place is so good to the point that I came back 3 times in a period of 2 weeks and ordered the same item every single time I went. My ultimate favourite meal there is probably the seafood sondubu. It comes with a vege bibimbap and the portion is very generous and very affordable! (15$ for these two). You can always change the bibimbap for a bowl of rice, which is what I did last time. The food stays hot for a long time so you don't have to worry that it will cool down. Also, the staff are very nice and the decor is very cozy and the waiting period isn't really that long. (I went around 8pm each time)."}
{"text":"A really solid place when you get down to the nitty gritty. I had a taste of the rolled omelette, and tteokbokki with cheese, which were flavorful and a good foil for each other; the omelette had a slightly sweet sauce and the rice cakes had a great heat. My seafood soondoobu and bibimbap were delicious, even the leftovers were good the next day! A lot of various seafood were found in that delicious broth. I also had a peach Makgulli which reminded me of my first time trying to drink. Really sweet and not a lot of alcohol, which went well with the spicy food. A couple of downsides, a single bathroom for the whole restaurant, and a smokey and hot interior. Service was ok, it was like a rotating cast of waiters and waitresses after a certain point. They had a really sweet waiter whose name I never got, but braces guy - you did a great job with our demanding and bossy bunch. I'm sure I'll be back at some point to try the raw beef and their ramyun."}
{"text":"PROS:  1. The food is delicious, authentic Korean. All the stews come with a bibimbap. So you will not leave hungry!  2. It's a small place which looks family owned. Staff are friendly and quick.  CONS:  1. The decor is pretty confusing. It looks like you're inside an Irish pub hosting a birthday party.    2. Ban-chan (small side dishes) are NOT provided as they customarily are with Korean food. Which I found surprising and disappointing since that never happens in Korea.  OVERALL: -I'd say Chez Bong and 5000 ans are tied as my best Korean places downtown. If you don't care for little side dishes, go to 5000 ans. But if you want a true Korean dining experience go to Chez Bong.  -I'd recommend the Pork Bone Soup (spicy!) miam!!"}
{"text":"Good food, unique little local and fun atmosphere. The amoubt if food for the price is more than fair. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I had no idea the place changed owners, they used to be called 5000 ans, now its samcha. Love how simple the menu is lol. I was quite surprised that their stew costs 14$, which is really pricy for average korean stew, but thats because for every stew you order you get a free vege bibimbap. Now the price makes more sense. I had the beef soondubu jiggae, the seafood pancake, and the beef tartare. - soondubu jiggae: probably the best i had in a long time. Lots of onions and beef, the stew is not too spicy and really flavorful. Loved it. - seafood pancake: their pancake was really thin compared to those served in other places, so it has extra crunch at the bottom. Love the fact that they put green onions and zucchini in it. - beef tartare: Suuuper good! I'll probably order this every time I come. They topped it with a raw egg yolk and sesame seeds. The sauce is sweet and salty, they put thin apple sticks at the bottom. The texture of the beef itself is great, you don't have to chew a lot. And for only 9$ you get quite a lot.  The only dowbside is that food comes relatively slowly, so if you have a 1 hour lunch break you might feel tight on time. Definitively gonna come back for sure!"}
{"text":"J'y suis allée deux fois et j'ai bien aimé. Plats exotiques et peu dispendieux. L'endroit n'est par contre pas des plus chaleureux. Parfait pour un petit dîner rapide en solo ou pour découvrir une cuisine authentique coréenne."}
{"text":"Got the Korean pancake, cold noodles, and egg omelet. Flavours were great, but food comes a bit slow. Price is reasonable. Warm friendly decor and they play some great tracks! (K hip hop and future R&B) Ideal for small parties, or dates I guess. Would definitely go again and try some other entrees. They need to give banchan though! Authentic Korean restaurants can't skimp out on that."}
{"text":"Pour le moment, c'est mon meilleur coréen en ville!  Portion généreuse et goûteuse, et très abordable. Endroit sympathique et service courtois. Bibimbap: copieux et goûteux. Ragoût kimchi: miamy...beaucoup de flanc de porc  Il faut que j'y retourne pour le bbq.  Définitivement à recommander!"}
{"text":"We ordered bbq combo for two, bibimbap is just so so, the combo is enough for two person. One salad, two soup, one bibimbap and bbq beef, bbq beef is delicious. Nice small place."}
{"text":"So delicious. I always order the pork jeyuk with noodles and extra spicy sauce! They bring you the raw items and cook it in front of you and you wait as it sizzles away."}
{"text":"5000 years of mediocre food. Nice ambience though."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite Korean restaurant in Montreal. I first came here during a FoodFest event, but it was so good that I returned a few times afterwards. Get the OSAM! You have an option of bibimbap or fried rice and, trust me, as someone who loves bibimbap and chose that the first time, I realized it was a mistake and thereon afterwards always picked fried rice. You get egg and cheese with your rice and it is deeeeelicious with the sauce of the veggies and seafood/meat! I love the cozy atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"This Korean restaurant has been a hit or miss experience personally. At times, I received excellent service with succulent food. At others, service was practically inexistant with stale dishes.   Strangely enough, this stark inconsistency manifested itself during a single visit last time I had dinner there.  We were greeted by a young woman with a sunny disposition and were seated in the solarium. I ordered some tea and two dishes of Yukhoe (Korean beef tartare). Up to this point, the service was courteous, attentive, and brisk. My first dish of Yukhoe came and was absolutely delicious. The meat was tender and just melted in my mouth.   Unfortunately, my second dish of Yukhoe came and bore no resemblance to my first dish. (See photo attached). The meat was darker and the sesame seeds were missing. As soon as I took the first bite, I realized that the taste was different too: acrid and pungent. To make matters worse, our waitress disappeared and no one was available to refill our water for the remainder of our meal.  This visit just epitomizes how service and food can be inconsistent within the same establishment. Although the prices are very reasonable, your experience here might very well be the luck of the draw, in the lap of the Gods..."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best, I got the yakiudon and the beef tartar and both were sweet. It's almost as if majority of the seasoning was only sugar and soy sauce. The atmosphere was great and uplifting but is too crowded and doesn't allow much walking room."}
{"text":"Very nice foods and friendly staffs.  Everything is good, only thing that I will complain is the ventilation is not so good."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant mérite amplement ces 4 étoiles. L'endroit est petit mais chaleureux. Quel ne fut pas notre chance que d'avoir notre table dans la petite verrière avec le soleil qui accompagnait notre Saporro bien froide. Leur spécialité est le bbq japonais. Il nous apporte un poêle au butane et un plaque pour faire cuire nos morceaux de viandes mariné. La bouffe est délicieuse, le service est courtois et à la hauteur de mes attentes. J'y retourne assurément."}
{"text":"The food and the service were great! I would like to come back sometimes (: It's also a really cute place and the music was great too."}
{"text":"Went here with a bunch of friends the other day for AYCE! Although the menu variety and decor are not nearly as nice as Chako, I really enjoyed the meat itself. I thought the marinate was done much better than at Chako and the quality was a lot better for the limited menu items you did get!  Its definitely worth a try, especially if you're not a fan of random menu items like tempuras/sushi etc. at other kbbqs and just want to go for strictly the kbbq!"}
{"text":"I've tried some Korean restaurant around this one...and this one's far the best of! My girlfriend and I we did order a seafood pancake, and others delicious dishes ...and no mistakes! Always have been a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Came back to Sam Cha to satisfy some Korean food cravings and to give this place another go. Our menu selection was so much better this time around. Went with the beef tartare (our favourite from last time) and the entré-size bulgogi which was pretty good. I definitely recommend the tofu kimchi entrée (but actually what an enormous portion!) and the gamjatang, both tasted amaaazinnggg!!!! I honestly can't wait to taste the other soups here!   Loving this place so far, I would rate it 4  1/2 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Cold noodle soup, the taste was alright, but the way they deal with the beef was not authentic: the beef supposed to be thickly sliced but they used grilled thin beef slice instead which is not as good when being cooled...the service was kinda slow that took more than 25 mins with only a few people in the restaurant....and the place is kinda pricy"}
{"text":"Great food.  One the rare asian places in Montreal with authentic. Price is good for food and high for drinks.   They accept credit cards but not AMEX.  Overall a great experience, will go back again."}
{"text":"Went there with my mom and niece for my mom birthday dinner and the overall experience was great!   We've ordered a seafood pancakes, spicy seafood tofu soup and BBQ beef ribs.   The seafood pancake was a bit of a turn-off, doesn't taste as good as I expected, it wasn't crispy enough.   The seafood tofu soup was amazing! Very spicy, I mean very very spicy but very tasty.   The BBQ beef ribs was also good but I find it weird, they place the grill in your table but they cook it for you... I mean what's the point of having the grill on the table if we are not doing it ourself??   Both main dishes cones with a bimbimap (rice inside of a hot stone bowl) I'm usually not a fan of bimbimap but the ones they have are very good.   The service was very nice, most korean restaurant are very polite and take good cares of you.   Will go back for sure to try other stuff"}
{"text":"I come here often. They have amazing food. Nice atmosphere day and night. Staff are very friendly. This place is very clean. At the back, they also have a private place for a private party."}
{"text":"Je suis très déçu de mon expérience culinaire coréenne. La nourriture de ce restaurant est relativement dispendieuse pour la grosseur des portions. Le service est rapide et courtois mais malheureusement, ce service fut seulement en anglais ou en coréen. Le restaurant applique la loi 101 dans le menu et dans l'affichage mais pas dans le service.   La décoration me fait penser à une cantine très quétaine au bord d'une route avec des tables de pic-nique vraiment pas confortable et des jouets pour enfant en guise de décoration. Je ne suis pas un fin connaisseur en terme de décoration mais au prix qu'on paye pour manger, je pense qu'on mérite un peu de confort et de respect.   De plus, au Québec, on a une habitude alimentaire qui date depuis le début de la colonie de la Nouvelle-France. On mange des repas riches en protéine et riche en calorie mais aussi une énorme quantité de nourriture. Plus on mangeait à l'époque, plus on avait des chances de survie en hiver. Aujourd'hui, on a conservé cette habitude alimentaire, surtout à l'arrivé de l'hiver. Qu'on soit actif ou non, il faut manger à notre faim au Québec. Tout ça pour vous dire que moi, quand je mange, je mange jusqu'à temps que mon estomac explose. Je ne sais pas c'est quoi l'habitude alimentaire des asiatiques et des coréens en général mais je sais que généralement au Québec, on mange à notre faim. À 16$ pour une soupe qui contient à peine trois tranches de boeuf mince comme une tranche de bacon, trois ou quatre morceaux de tofu très mince et bizarrement très mou et quelque petit morceaux de légumes douteux, non merci. Heureusement que le repas principal, était accompagné par un bol de riz.  Je suis désolé mais ce restaurant « coréen » est une fraude alimentaire."}
{"text":"Food is okay, very spicy though No Korean appetizers (unlike other Korean restaurants) - a disappointment Staff is friendly, but service is slow Prices are good  We were a big group so maybe the service was slow because of our big numbers.  One of us ordered a kind of appetizer and I ordered shots of a certain liquor but they ran out of both. They only told us (and I guess, they only realized), when they were working our orders so there may be lack of planning with their supplies."}
{"text":"The restaurant is good for Korean BBQ of small portion if you don't want to have a BBQ buffet."}
{"text":"Favorite korean restaurant in Montreal. Perfect for either a date or simply hanging out with a few friends. The place is quite small (sits around 30), and is often full, so I recommend that you make a reservation if you are more than 2. Beef tartare is amazing. I highly recommend the dishes for two people that are cooked at your table. Ask for the fried rice instead of the bibimbap, you won't regret it. I came often, and never said that a dish did not taste good."}
{"text":"The menu touts meat, however, both the meat dishes I ordered were....a bit lacking on the protein front. It smells great though. The place is small, but the ordering process is fast. The wait staff can be a tad slow (five minutes to get a coke), but they are relatively nice."}
{"text":"the service is good but the food........tofu soup is so salty that I add water in it. Chilli sauce tastes not like traditional Korean sauce, too sour. The so called ramen is fast food. haha After finishing I went out, the air outside was so fresh and my hair my jacket even my face~~all my body smelled like bacon I need a totally cleaning OMG"}
{"text":"The food is extremely slooooooow. The bulgogi and kalbi taste mediocre (though better than other Korean places in Montreal).  They also force you to pay 15% tip for their bad and slow service. The stove also takes so long to cook and burns pretty easily. When we said that we weren't happy with the service, they said that they changed the grill for us so multiple times so they had to charge us 15% (and they did not inform us this when we were dining). They also told us not to come back and they don't care if we write them a negative review on Yelp.   Unbelievable."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant has a cozy vibe to it. Their decor is very simple but homey. Although the front is a bit on the smaller side, they do have a backroom for larger parties.  FOOD: Best Korean BBQ I've ever had. Their meat is so flavorful and marinated to a perfection. Their side dishes are also quite good. They are pretty generous with their portions with is definite plus. Everything is nicely presented and the quality is great. I would absolutely recommend this place!  PRICE: Their menu prices are slightly more expensive than other Korean restaurants but their quality and quantity are much better. Definitely worth it.  SERVICE: Their service was very good and welcoming. They were attentive to our grill and made sure to change it when it was getting too old."}
{"text":"My favorite Korean restaurant, good price, good taste good quantity, kimchi pancake is the best, and you can get a tasty soup with bibimbap for 15$."}
{"text":"Nice tiny place, nice service, standard korean food , bbq etc, entracy by the basement. J'aime l'eclairage et le sourire du staff."}
