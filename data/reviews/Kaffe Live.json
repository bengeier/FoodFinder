{"text":"First time here.  A friend invited me to try out his favorite place.  It has now become a favorite of mine as well.    They allow live music performers on the corner stage from time to time and their food is excellent.  Roast beef sandwich was great and the deliciousness of the sandwich tempted me to order something else as well.  Josh the owner is great; professional, friendly, and good humor."}
{"text":"Was good food got the breaksfast bowl Was a small kaffe deli think they need more food though  Was small not to many people"}
{"text":"This was the best community focused establishment in Spring Valley. I will be Devastated seeing this place go. I owe Josh & his amazing family more than just a generous tip for this awesome creative haven of good times & feels.  -Harley (Natty & Groundbreaking)"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and wraps. Came on Saturday they had kids karaoke 4-6pm and at 6 some entertainment for adults. The tuna sandwich was delicious...and so are their lattice chips."}
{"text":"Kaffe live has a great environment!  It's great to have a family friendly restaurant that is locally owned in the neighborhood.  I have eaten here several times and have always enjoyed the food.  The owners are super sweet.  It's so great to see locally owned businesses who care about you and what they do!! :)"}
{"text":"Good location, awesome food and great staff! Had the chorizo breakfast burrito as well as the Mexican sliders."}
{"text":"I was in line for a haircut at the Mane Barbershop and had a little time to kill so I went a couple doors down to Kaffe Live Restaurant for lunch today.   Aside from the fact that they come from my home State of Minnesota, the food was great and the service was excellent! If you want to experience Minnesota Nice, stop in a Breakfast Latte in the morning or a Sandwich for Lunch or Dinner.... By the way, they also serve Beer, Wine and/or Mamosa's for adults of course.  A couple of other observations: I noticed a small stage with a guitar and mic for live entertainment.... They also have shelves of books, crayons and coloring paper so I'm going to take a long shot and say that Kids are Welcome.   I think it's a Must Try it Out if you Haven't\""}
{"text":"Went to use my Groupon on a Sunday got there at 4 hours state open till 5 and they were closed. The open sign was still on but doors locked. Not a great start to go to this business. I will not be returning and had asked for a refund from Groupon."}
{"text":"Really good. Got the veggie wrap the fried zucchini sticks make it so much better than a typical veggie wrap. Super fresh lettuce and the chips were great and crunchy. The potato skins were good and the Caesar salad was about average. Good prices and on uber eats. Def will be a regular customer."}
{"text":"Part venue, part breakfast spot, part community gathering place- Kaffe Live kind of has a lot going on. Their live music and open mic nights definitely make them stand out, but they still seem to be finding their footing in the kitchen.  I've come in for breakfast and the coffee is just okay- good pricing and a variety of flavored syrups for your latte, but some difficulty executing orders correctly. The Kaffe Bowl is a great breakfast option, adding mushrooms, avocado, and ham made it really filling, but it would have been better if they'd remembered the gravy and queso sauces I'd asked for on the side.   Returned for a takeout order with a Groupon, placed a large order that was mostly correct. It appears their sliders have been removed from the menu so your lunch choices are various sandwiches. The tuna on ciabatta was tasty, with carrots and sunflower seeds, but the buffalo chicken wrap was unexpectedly heated- not so great when it includes lettuce, which turned slimy. The salmon bagel was tasty though, and something I'd get again.   Service was really friendly on my first visit when I worked with the owner, who was happy to tell us all about his new business. Location needs to consider kicking up the food quality or expanding the menu, as they are very close to another stellar breakfast and lunch option. Note that they do have beer and wine available for evening events."}
{"text":"Here's my thing when it's NOT that busy and I have to wait 15 min for a simple buffalo chicken wrap I have a problem. For the price of the wrap  it's decent could add a little bit more \"mmmph\" in the wrap... I don't knock anyone's hustle however, there's chipotle next door and in n out across the street where I could be happier with a protein burger....just saying. On the bright positive side the owner is VERY NICE and welcoming, this place is very clean, nice atmosphere, friendly staff, and entertainment while you sit down and eat"}
{"text":"This place is an amazing piece of edible art! A small corner stage allows for impromptu singing and scheduled open Mics and features. The chipotle bacon chicken ciabatta sandwich  could rival most East Coast sandwich shops. The staff is friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"Good food, good price, great service. We had the breakfast bowl with avocado and mushrooms and the chorizo burrito was delicious! The man agate or owner was very cool! He told us this place is catered for families. They do live music that's family friendly, but we were only there for breakfast."}
{"text":"Here for a art show but are checking out the food. The Cuban sliders are great. Pesto, red pepper with the choice of beef or chicken. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich on cabata bread. Just the right amount of heat.Overall good food."}
{"text":"Ordered the roast beef sandwich with salted chips on UberEATS because it was quick. Pleasantly surprised by the sandwich; nice amount of horseradish without being overwhelming. The baguette was grilled to perfection. The chips were amazing! Super crunchy and delicious. Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"5 stars! That means that I want to come back time and time again. I have been to this place now 13 times in the last year and I've had it delivered via post mates another 4.   The food is fresh and amazing. It's not a high scale place with confetti on the plate but it's very tasty and has never disappointed. To go on that point, I have never left here disappointed.   Their breakfast is fresh and delicious. I love their queso dip and the create your own. I've had 2 sandwiches and they were also good but the breakfast has my heart.   The 5 stars begins with the owner. A great guy who greets anyone with a smile once they walk in.   Come support a local business and get a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great wraps!!!  I was surprised to see how nice this place was on the inside!   I met the owner and he is very cool, and a local las vegas dude.   Food is fresh and good!  I am excited to try the breakfast burrito the next time around!   You definitely want to try this place.  Very cool atmosphere, clean and friendly!  Kudos!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while driving by for a breakfast burrito and a wrap. Chorizo and avocado burrito, and veggie wrap for the wife... Wow! Really really really good food!  The chips that came with the wrap were awesome. I wish I came for lunch because they serve beer too! It was too early for a brew with breakfast. They have some cool art on the walls from local artists and they have a little stage for live music performances. This looks like a cool, chill spot to be hang for drinks and entertainment the next time the wife and I get a babysitter. Definitely heading back there for more breakfast burritos.  And I think I'm going to grab some wraps to bring to my company Xmas party potluck. Saves me time in the kitchen and the food will make me look good."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is tasty! The entertainment rocks! The owner is super friendly and puts their heart into this place. Love the breakfast bowls! Mmm"}
{"text":"Tried out this restaurant for lunch and was not disappointed. Had the tuna sandwich on honey-wheat and it was amazing. Fresh food is hard to find. The owner was also a delight to talk to. Can't wait to. One back with the family when they have a live performer."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I had the Kaffe Bowl with avocado, mushrooms & gravy and it was incredible. I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"I always got breakfast bowls from this place via Uber eats and love them!! So delicious and fresh. Today was my first time coming into the restaurant. I'm super impressed with the cleanliness and friendliness of staff. They are trying to build a community here, which is difficult in Las Vegas. They hold paint nights, open mics, and art galleries. The prices are reasonable. They also serve beer, cider, and mimosas -alcohol is always a plus! Come try their amazing food and hang out with locals!"}
{"text":"What a quaint, cute place! I saw this place undergoing construction awhile back & they're finally open for coffee dates, breakfast, karaoke nights, family outings, or live music with friends. It's super family friendly with the crayons. Great concept, small menu. We ordered a breakfast bowl, breakfast burrito, zucchini sticks, acai smoothie, & banana smoothie.  The queso blanco cheese dip paired well with out breakfast foods, but could've been hotter instead of Luke warm. The smoothies were basic. No crazy additives like protein. The 2 gentleman were very friendly as well. I'll probably be back for a grab n go breakfast again."}
{"text":"This is the best meal I've had in a while. Really great service and quality ingredients. They make all of their sauces in house."}
{"text":"Stopped in a after my shift at the hospital up the street for a cup of tea and stayed for the music and atmosphere. Cool little place, would definitely come back and hang out more."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today after reading the reviews and was not disappointed!!  Grabbed the Yelp deal which made it really great!  Had the chipotle chicken wrap with my boyfriend getting the ham wrap...his looked really yummy!  I loved mine!!  They do their own chipotle mayo in house which was awesome!  A bit hotter than normal which I really enjoyed!!  Everything was really fresh too . The lattice chips were very good as well and since we had the Yelp deal we got some zucchini too!  Service was speedy the food was out to us in less than 10 minutes . One star off just because the soda is bottled...hopefully they can get a soda station soon!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We recently visited Kaffe Live and we were pleasantly surprised to discover such an awesome place with great food, entertainment an a fun atmosphere for our little family. Our food was delicious, the service was perfect and the live entertainment really added to our visit. We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I got the Chipotle chicken wrap and it was delicious. Great food, family friendly environment, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Just like some others, we stopped here on the way out of town to do some hiking in the hills.  We were enticed by the high rating, but were a bit surprised when we walked in at noon and this place was dead.  We ordered very forgettable food, and I remember my breakfast bowl was out of avocados, so I just told the person behind the counter to 'surprise me' with an alternative (I think I got extra of something altho I couldn't tell).  I also had an ice coffee which was fine, nothing to rave about.  Just an A-OK spot from my experience, location and emptiness left it feeling very odd that its 4.5 stars as of this review."}
{"text":"Live music and great food on a Sunday afternoon beautiful self taught acustic guitarist and singer Francine Summerville playing 12-3 today great atmosphere and easy to get to 215"}
{"text":"We found this place thru a Yelp deal. The place looked like it had just opened because it was c-l-e-a-n. The owner was super friendly and enthusiastic, and our order came out quickly.   We had a bowl, a wrap, and a sandwich plus 3 of the healthy bottle drinks (which were really, really good). Some positives and negatives about the food though.   The smoked salmon bowl was different but in a good way. I'd recommend this. The smoked salmon wrap was ok, but not as good as the bowl. The roast beef sandwich though was very underwhelming.  It was a very basic sandwich like something you'd make at home if you didn't have a lot of time. For home that's fine, but at a restaurant it's disappointing. Maybe because my parents owned a deli for over ten years and I used to work in the kitchen during the summers, I expect a lot from a sandwich. Their sandwich for me was a 1-star.  There were however a couple of budding pop stars there taking up the mic on the little stage. The day we went was kids stage day and they're was a family with a couple little kids who were belting out tune after tune which provided for some smiles and cheers. That was nice. I believe local amateurs also perform there on certain days and times.   Overall, there was a vagueness to the theme and menu of this place and the food we ordered reflected that. I don't think the owner is a real, hardcore foodie or a I-sleep-with-my-chefs-knife kind of cook. The place seems like it was started out of an idea to combine live music with some simple food.   I hope it gets grounded, comes up with some really good food, a solid focus and succeeds. I'd watch a bunch a Diners, Drive Ins & Dives episodes, pick out a selection of the best, most doable, test them out and try to create a short menu of homeruns. Nobody cares where you got the recipe and you don't have to tell anyone. It just needs to be good and cheap. Word spreads fast when you can knock em out of the park every time."}
{"text":"I thought this place was truly a gem. Very inexpensive satisfying food they offer. I had a skillet with chorizo and mushrooms and it was delicious! They also offer really cool things like a loyalty card buy 5 meals and the 6th is on them. I was not there when they had live music I just came to pick up my food but I can only imagine how nice that'd be. This place has so much potential and I hope they go far. They can count on me returning :)"}
{"text":"I'm so upset that I haven't come across this place sooner, because Kaffe Live undoubtedly one of my new favorite places. The owner, John, was extremely kind and attentive, and I can't thank him enough for such great customer service. As we walked in, he gave us an explanation of the menu, as well as informed us of the performances scheduled each week. We ended up getting the breakfast bowl, very inexpensive but held great quality. I can't wait to come back and try more things!"}
{"text":"Fresh, clean, and friendly!  My husband had the Texan sliders and said they were the best he's ever had (and he gets sliders everywhere.)  Prices are very reasonable.  And bottomless mimosas... YES!  Atmosphere was relaxed and I think it would be fun to go back when they have live music playing.  Will definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Only downfall is that it doesn't open till 9 am on the weekends when I want a Kaffe bowl at 7 am! I've always ordered the same thing....I know I know how boring of me. I can't help it that I like something and that's what I always get. I always order kaffe bowl with bacon and avocados. Flavorful enough and it's decent for $6 and it fills you up. The last few times they've forgotten the gravy since I have to order it to go, so that was a bummer. I don't drink coffee but my husband said it was pretty good. Overall, I like that this place is near by and you don't feel like you are eating 1,000 calories for breakfast. I would definitely come here more often if it opened a tad bit earlier, but I know not everyone is an early bird like me."}
{"text":"Place hasn't skipped a beat since I last visited with some new additions to their alcohol selection. I had the egg breakfast with avocado and smoked salmon with my usual peppermint mocha. Healthy portion of tasty smoked salmon for the price. The owner is great guy, very amicable."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. We stopped in for breakfast on our way to Red Rock Canyon, based on Yelp reviews for \"Breakfast\".  We ordered a couple of breakfast bowls.  We were the only ones in the place at about 11:30am on a Tuesday.  The guy working the counter (I think the owner) was very nice but preoccupied with whatever was going on in the kitchen.  The breakfast bowls took a really long time to come out (maybe he was training a new cook ??) and they were just ok, nothing special at all or much different than you can get at a fast food restaurant. The atmosphere is wide open and not cozy at all, feels like tables inside of an industrial or strip mall space, not a restaurant.  It could be a whole different story as a live music venue. Another thing I thought odd were their hours - not early enough to really be a \"breakfast\" place and not late enough to be an \"entertainment\" place. With a few changes the place could turn into something more special, they just need to decide what that is going to be."}
{"text":"This is a new family owned cafe. Live entertainment daily while you eat. Cool spot and great concept. Good eats."}
{"text":"We were at work as usual and were looking to purchase lunch outside of our hospital cafeteria. We went on trusty old Yelp and this place popped up. We ordered 3 item, I had the Buffalo chicken wrap and it was mighty tasty and spicy. It was still warm when we received our order through post mate delivery. My other 2 coworkers enjoyed their meals as well. We will definitely order from them again. Maybe even pay a visit in person. Good simple food."}
{"text":"My oh my...how good could a breakfast bowl be, I ask myself. Until I took one bite of my \"make it your own\" breakfast bowl yesterday. I'm eating \"low carb\" at the moment at Josh at kaffe live had no problem tending to my dietary needs for my meal. Not only was the service so damn good but the food was even better. It was my first time here and certainly not my last. Oh..and someone please give the man a raise!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends and family! Food is excellent as well! Get the chips with Cajun seasoning they are the best. Haven't had the breakfast yet but it is served all day so I will be back to do so."}
{"text":"the chipotle chicken club in a wrap is a must!!!   The service is awesomeness to its fullest!!!"}
{"text":"Does not delivered but if you have doordash they deliver for free with a $15 purchase. We ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich.. you can pick the bread you want as well, this sandwich was delicious, the chipotle mayo is a bit spicy though. It also comes w fresh lattice chips. They were super crispy and tasty.   We also ordered mozzarella sticks. They were so good and at $4.99, you can't beat the price. We will def order from here again."}
{"text":"Nice lunch spot.  Sandwich was good.  Chips were good.  Wish there were more places like this in the valley."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to pick up my after workout meals at before I have to go to work for 7+ hours.  Always return and very much recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tried their food for the first time today, got two sandwiches, beef sliders, and an order of the fried zuhccini sticks (to die for). each came with a side of waffle chips with seasoning. staff was super nice, will definatley be back!!"}
{"text":"We can't wait to come back here. We had a delicious turkey sandwich, breakfast burrito, and buffalo chicken sandwich out on the patio with our Floof. We also had two amazing cups of coffee. An iced white mocha and iced peppermint latte. So yummy! The service was perfecto and the food was fabulous."}
