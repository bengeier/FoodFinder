{"text":"You have to take McCarthy's for what it is...The local \"authentic\" Irish pub in your neighborhood. If you've been to Ireland you've been in a pub like this, a place that serves enough Guinness on tap to keep it fresh, friendly service, and the best part of the experience is the conversation with the people there. Thumbs up for McCarthy's."}
{"text":"Petty confident this is an IRA front. But who cares! Service is great, elbow room on the bar has regulars groves in it. Patio is cute outside in good weather and the first time you come you'll get the 20 questions. 2nd time you show, they are introducing you around. absolutely fantastic bar. Irish or not."}
{"text":"Gotta say...I love this place as well.  I had been there once and had forgotten the name so didn't know how to find it again!  Just such a charming vibe.  Small, intimate, a little hard to find as it's tucked away on Gerrard east of Coxwell.  Downside, I don't think they serve any food."}
{"text":"Come by  more then once and you won't be a stranger.

Yes, it may be full of Irish, often fresh from the airport, but always friendly, I should now, live just down the street and it sometimes feels like it's become my living room, the one with an ever changing circle of friends.

It's even better in the summer, the patio faces the afternoon sun, need I say more??

It can be quite busy at times, but sunday later afternoon, early evenings are usually a good time for those that aren't in for a crowd.

Most Mondays there is usually a celtic music jam, a bit of a ceilidh, if you will.... and most fridays there is also music of a more pedestrian nature"}
{"text":"\"Is everyone here Irish?\" I asked the barkeep this afternoon as she poured my pint of Welly Dark.  \"Umm... Everyone at the bar,\" she replied in an accent that pronounced bar \"baw-r\" like a real Irish person. 

As we sat outside on one of 2 picnic tables mid-Sunday more regulars trickled in.  And they were ALL IRISH.  Every single person except the Scottish me and the very German Kat F, was Irish.  And they all seemed to have walked there!  Seriously, there were over a dozen Irish patrons.  I didn't even know there were a dozen Irish people in Toronto.

The good:
- This place is amazing (very detailed good thing, right?)
- They have decent taps - Sapporo, Welly Dark and the regular stuff
- There is live music on Fridays and Celtic dancing on Mondays
- There are 2 dart boards but there isn't enough room to play darts
- The restrooms are individual rooms and SUPER clean
- 6$ even for a pint of Welly

The bad:
- There is a sketchy step on the way to the restroom
- No music was playing when we walked in and no one was talking - it was just a bunch of people drinking and staring at me
- I felt a little weird being... not Irish

Funny story:
I said \"wow, you have Sapporo on draught here?\" admittedly a bit incredulously, and the young man at the bar turned around and said \"Yah, we're cultured round here!\" in his charming Irish lilt.

Love this place.  Will be back soon."}
