{"text":"Had the braised lamb shanks with stuffed grape leaves and barley soup appetizers.  Everything was wonderful.  Very nice subtle seasonings. The baklava was a sweet end to a great meal.  I would like to note this resaurant is emaculate.  The staff is kind and very attentive to service.  Pick a nite and try is fine restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great time , great staff friendly and very hospitable, food was great, we had the chichen tika and taboole, and the home made desert. great job tarboosh. We will be back"}
{"text":"Love this place, they have great selection of Lebaneese food, so fresh and made me feel like I'm at home and my mom cooked the food.. My kids are so picky and I was surprised how much they loved the food.. Service is great, super friendly.
The best stuffed grape leaves I've ever ate."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time on Sunday 12/30/12 and we were very pleased. The Cleanest and friendliest middle eastern restaurant in northern Ohio. The food is superb and reminds me with my mothers cooking. The deep fried Kebbeh balls are the best I ever had. The falafel are also the best around. You can't go wrong with this restaurant if you are looking for authentic Arabic food. We will go there again soon."}
{"text":"We love it here! I think better food and priced than Aladdins. We have tried the hummus, grape leaves, friend kibbeh, fattoush salad, lentil soup, beef shwarma roll, chicken pitza, and kofta platter. Not one has disappointment yet!! Please try it here! I will be so disappointed if they don't make it"}
{"text":"If you're heading down Pleasant Valley Road past Normandy High School heading east and toward civilization, you can fight your way over just past the mr. chicken and hang a left across from the squalid marc's shopping center and eat in this place.

I went there slightly desperate and anxious. I needed to self-medicate and they didn't offer beer or liquor. I brought my own and swilled it from a flask. Don't judge. I ordered a lot of things from here that you'd like. Things like hummus and samosas and zatar with a spoon. The people were so nice. They aren't jaded or bitter or out to squeeze a buck out of you. It was refreshing to actually meet real people who want to sell good foreign food and make a living off of it. 

The food was really good and sitting alone in a great restaurant with a scary name in a really foul town like Parma can be cathartic. You know you get to leave and if you do so with a good meal for less than an ass-piercing price, you feel like you stole one off of the ugly side of reality. You know how it is supposed to work and you know you're supposed to be a little bitter and a bit angsty about  the restaurant-patron interaction but here you get none of that. 

I really like zatar. I imagine you can put it on anything and up the taste factor -boom- just like that by dipping it in zatar. You can dip anything in it and it sticks and adds crunch etc. and you're glad you did.

Thanks, Tarboosh. You reaffirmed my hope that there are still real people doing honest things in this ugly, sorrowful world where people eat at red lobster and dip things in butter that ought not be dipped in butter."}
{"text":"What a great place to enjoy Mediterranean style or Middle Eastern style foods.

The food is excellent quality for the price, the service is good, and the owners are friendly and enjoy their customers.  The lamb dishes in particular are outstanding.

This is one of the best restaurants in this area of Parma/Seven Hills for the price, and a welcome change from the fast food junk in the area.

We also used them to cater our son's wedding rehearsal dinner, and they did not disappoint!  The food was outstanding for that."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is erratic and extremely slow. I go here from time to time but the portions have gotten kinda skimpier than before and after my last visit I left feeing hungry which isn't how I should feel given what I paid. Their falafel is excellent and their food is much better than Aladdin's overall but be prepared to wait and wait and wait even for a simple order. The atmosphere isn't much to write home about--think Parma diner with a few token Arabic accoutrements sprinkled here and there."}
{"text":"Great falafel and delicious hummus! They were out of a lot of desserts when we went, but we will be back for sure!

Update: I tried the baklava and it was OUTSTANDING!!!"}
{"text":"My husband & I are from SW Ohio & were visiting Cuyahoga Valley Nat'l Park. We were in want of a vegetarian friendly meal. After reading reviews, (some of which were contradictory,) we decided to take a chance on Tarboosh. So glad we did. I had a new-to-me, fruity, red iced tea drink that I frankly loved (it was like a spiced fruit punch but it worked.) I ordered an $8 sampler plate that included falafel, lentil soup, hummus, salad. I don't normally like the way falafel is prepared at the restaurants in my city but the falafel at Tarboosh would bring me back into the fold. Delicious! My husband ordered a ($8) wrap called \"Grain Green Combo\" which was mjadra, hummus, toubbuleh & lettuce. His came with cup of soup too. We both loved the lentil soup. They were out of baklava so we split a $4 dessert called Namoura. This was ok. I had never tried it previously & probably wouldn't have gone with dessert if we weren't trying to extend our out of town food experience. Overall, we found our food tasty & if we lived anywhere near Tarboosh, we would definitely return as regulars. We do have Aladdin's where we live & while we are fans & regulars, I thought the flavors of the food served at Tarboosh Eatery edged out Aladdin's, particularly the falafel! With tip, our bill came to $33. I think the prices were reasonable and we left with full & happy bellies"}
{"text":"It deserves 3.5 stars but not 4...and I will return, I think I ordered the wrong dish. I ordered the Sumac Chicken. Let me be very candid, I am a stickler for moist, juicy chicken...the size of the portion was more than enough for a big eater, the seasonings were great but needed just a little salt. I asked the waitress...whom BTW was very attentive, sweet and helpful...I asked her to sub the fries/rice for a house salad...I REALLY enjoyed the salad with the house dressing. It was fresh, refreshing, crisp and perfectly seasoned and dressed. Next time I'll go with my gut and order the Lamb Shank."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. Our waitress, which was the owners wife I believe, was extremely friendly and accommodating. The restaurant was clean and had a great ambiance. Since middle eastern food is our favorite, my boyfriend and I get excited and order way too much food! Well who really cares, everyone loves leftovers and stuffing their faces right? 

We loved the grape leaves and lentil soup, both tasty! The chicken kabobs I ordered were flavorful and moist! Their hummus has a bit too much tahini for my liking. This may be random, but the salad dressing they have was delicious whatever it was. Very light and just perfect, I'm really not a huge dressing person so it was kind of a BIG deal ha. 

We finished our meal with dessert. Our waitress/owners wife recommended her specialty, which she makes fresh daily! I can't recall it's name, but it was delightful! Not too sweet, custard cake sort of, with crunchy grated pistachios on top. It was simple and perfect! Next time I come here I will figure this little gem of a desserts name. 

Tarboosh will give you that warm and inviting family atmosphere. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've eaten food from Tarboosh 4 times now, both dine-in and carry-out.  I am a big fan of this place, and I hope it does well and sticks around.  I am a big fan of Lebanese food in general, but my husband is not so he refuses to ever eat at Aladdin's.  But he will agree to get food from Tarboosh because they also have American foods on the menu (philly sandwich, burgers, popcorn shrimp, french fries, etc.)

I've sampled a lot of different foods here, and I've liked everything I've tried.  Some of the standouts were:  curry sambosas (4 large egg roll shaped samosas served with a yogurt dipping sauce for $4.95), Tarboosh salad, lentil soup, and Koshari (try it!).  My family had the Greek roll, vegetarian appetizer sampler (they'll substitute falafels for the kibbeh), gyro, and shish kebab, and everyone was happy with their food.

The place seems clean, the service is always friendly, and the prices are very reasonable.  I like that they offer some healthier options for a quick take-out dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped by in the afternoon and ordered carry out. The establishment  is very clean and nicely furnished. The owner was very friendly and helped me with my selection. The menu is fantastic, as it offers a wide variety of dishes. I ordered a greek salad and the lamb shish kebab (wrap), with Lentil soup on the side. The lamb meat was juicy and fresh, perfectly prepared and spiced. Greek salad was also great (amazing dressing) and so was the soup. Portions are a good size. I highly recommend this establishment and will defenitly return soon. Better then Aladdin's based on my first experience."}
{"text":"Tasty hummus and hot sauce. Liked the kafta roll too.

We'll go back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"This is the worst middle eastern restaurant in Cleveland. The waitresses are so overwhelmed. The food is bland and the portions are tiny.  Stay away."}
{"text":"This is my favorite middle eastern place to eat honestly my mother in law is from the Middle East and her food is amazing no one can come close and no I'm not saying that because she's my mother in law. But when she's not around and I'm craving some good food this is my new place first off the service is great and there have been a few places where the food was good but the service is terrible and for me that goes hand in hand so I can't enjoy my food. I do recommend the humus and grape leaves are so authentic tasting I love lentils so of course I had to try the rice with lentils I can't spell the name of the dish but it's really good I get a side of the chicken shawarma with it and comes with a salad the dressing is also very good I'm pretty sure it's home made too! Also you can choose a soup that comes with the meal too. So yes check it out if you're in the area and if not it's really worth the drive."}
{"text":"Not great. The kafta was seriously ground meat. No flavor no seasoning. The tabouli was good but VERY small portion for a large for 7.50. There's just better places than this. I am a bit biased bc I grew up eating Lebanese food. Aladdin's is better than this. I may retry bc the lady at the counter was so polite."}
{"text":"It's so difficult to find halal food in Cleveland, but I'm so blessed to live so close to Tarboosh.  Even my little grandpa who does not eat out EVER loves the shish tawook.  I also recommend their fried kibbeh, shawarma, mixed grill, lentil soup, really EVERYTHING. Alhamdulilah, so glad to have this restaurant so nearby :)"}
{"text":"Love, love, love their falafel burger and lentil soup! They're always so friendly and you don't have to wait long for your food."}
{"text":"Casual Middle Eastern food.  Casual setting, very clean.  Very ( almost overly) attentive service.  I was hungry so I had an order of the Ful (Fava bean stew... No Chiante here, sorry!) samosas, and French fries coated with Zatar ( love that stuff!!).  It was all great!! My hubby had the shawarma which he said was good, but missing some of the traditional accompaniments we are used to.  The samosas also were made with egg roll wrappers.  They were tasty but I am used to more of a pastry crust.  The prices were amazing and a TON of food!  Lots of vegan options too.  Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had an excellent meal at Tarboosh! We ordered two appetizers (falafal & stuffed grape leaves), two beef shishkabob dinners with rice, salad and lentil soup, 2 specialty dessert ( a homemade cake that was delicious) and two cups of Turkish coffee. Wow what a delightful, authentic meal! The service was outstanding, the dining room was very clean, there were many items to choose from on the menu and the prices were very reasonable (our total bill was less than $50). We will be return customers without a doubt!!"}
{"text":"Got carry out. The food was good. Fast, friendly service. The hummus wasn't my fave but loved the Kafta Burger and Greek Salad."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent, friendly service. Very reasonable prices and high quality food. Ordered the vegetarian sampler, falafel with fries and fava stew. We live on the other side of town, but we will be back often. Best find in a long time!"}
{"text":"Very good and tasty Lebanese food. Very well done. Fresh and good quality, taste and price. Very friendly environment and people. Quiet and nice place. Loved it. Will come back for sure. Highly recommended, worth going there :)"}
{"text":"What a let down.  The individuals that wrote good reviews on Tarboosh Eatery have no idea what true Lebanese food is.  They need to go to Nate's Deli on W. 25th Street and give it a try.  True foodies....STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!  I would not recommend you go here.  Maybe they were just having a bad day but I should not have to pay for their bad days.  The food was overall very bland and small portions for the price.  The hummus was nothing to write home about.  My husband could have had softer beef jerky on his gyro.  Not sure what kind of meat they put on it.  The fattoosh was dry and lacked sumac, lemon, and olive oil.  It looked like a bunch of old ice burg lettuce with a hunk of green pepper and a couple hunks of tomato.  The rice pudding had too much rose in it.  I felt like I was eating a bar of soap.

I was disappointed because I have heard good reviews.  Again, maybe a bad day but for the money, I am not going to chance it again."}
{"text":"Dug the gyro. Pita was excellent and the sauce was good. Rest of my party's food was \"tasty\". Soups were by far the best part of the meal"}
{"text":"Really authentic food. Could have used a little lemon juice on the grape leaves and in the hummus. The kibbeh nayeh was delicious. Fresh and made to order! Would love to come back and try more things."}
{"text":"Nice lady, but I give up. The appetizer I ordered was very good and nice homemade soups. However, the hours are erratic (it's a mom and pop place) and today my chicken shwarma ended up being beef schwarma which I do  not eat. I couldn't drive back 20 minutes to return it. It was not good. So I'm out."}
{"text":"I'm struggling here, based on YELP reviews, I was anxious to try Tarboosh Eatery.   Middle Eastern food is my fave.  I visited Tarboosh on a Tuesday for lunch.   There were no cars in the parking lot (first sign), and upon entering the restaurant there were no customers, despite it being noon and the eatery is located at a busy intersection.   I was seated immediately, given a menu and promptly ordered the Tawook rolled pita and a small order of tabbouli.   The tabbouli arrived first, ample portion.   There was no pita bread to accompany the tabbouli and upon tasting it, it would not have really mattered.   The tabbouli was tasteless.   It tasted like parsley, tomatoes and scallions, no seasoning or spices.   The parsley and tomatoes were dark and just not fresh.  It was evident that there was a sad attempt to revive the dish  before leaving the kitchen with a generous amount of BOTTLED lemon juice.  The dish was a complete fail.   My Tawook arrived shortly thereafter with a side of fries.  There was nothing \"middle eastern\" about the sandwich except the pita bread.   The chicken was sparse and non-descript.  It was yellowish in color which would hint that maybe it had been marinated?   There were pickles, tomatoes and brown lettuce, no tahini, no garlic sauce and no pickled turnips.   In addition, the fries were crispy and handcut, but could have been taken to a completely different level with middle eastern seasoning, like most Lebanese restaurants.  Maybe I went on an off day, this just didn't do it for me, especially because this place is located within 5 miles of 2 other OUTSTANDING Middle Eastern restaurants.   I would not go back:-("}
{"text":"I have no idea what everyone is ranting about. The food is bland as can be, the meat is dry, the portions are minimal, and the place smells bad. The people who enjoy this food have clearly never had authentic Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying that the lady serving food here was so kind and helpful. I've had this place bookmarked for months and was finally in the area and decided to try it. 

Upon walking in on a week day at 5:00, there was no one dining in, and no one noticed us at the door for a couple of minutes. The place is pretty big inside, bigger and nicer than it appears from the outside.  We finally got seated by the nice lady and she advised us what to order based on what we wanted to try--everything.  

Ordered the mixed grill entree and large appetizer sampler platter for two of us to share. The food came out and there was plenty for 2 people. We had a good sampling of almost everything. Hummus, was really good, needed lemon. Everything needed lemon. The baba was smoky and tasty.  The mixed grill was what we were really disappointed with though. It was $19.99 which was way too costly for what it was. It came with a cup of soup and a side of hummus, rice, salad, and 3 meats (chicken, beef and kofta).  The meats I thought were tough and tasted funny.  Nothing on that plate impressed me except for the hummus, I will give them that."}
{"text":"I'd give zero, if possible. I tried them out becauase of the amazing reviews. How could it have went SO wrong? Food and service were unacceptable. I ordered shawarma wrap $8 with hot sauce. No flavor. Fell apart. Luke warm. My experience went downhill from there. Ordered 3 kibbeh $8.5 & baba $5. The male owner didnt want to be wrong so he told me kibbeh is supposed to be FILLED with oil (pictured). The couple who owns Tarboosh only care about positive feedback and wanted to nickel & dime me because I sent my wrap back. In this business, some times news of a bad experience go farther than good. Mine has reached multiple people since dining here. My friend wasn't impressed either & she ordered a large sampler. The female owner (also my waitress) was offended at the mention of Aladdins.. well let's be honest here, they have multiple locations. 
Look at my bill (& what I left behind) for my 14mo old and I to eat. Minus the soup I had to argue to have removed from bill because it was included in price of wrap I sent back."}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED.

I want to start by saying that I love the food here. We came for lunch in a little group and sampled a bunch of stuff. The salads were great, the hummus, baba ganoush and  soup was really good also. Our server was so sweet!

The one thing I would like to see updated is the decor. It is more like a cafeteria with a tile floor and outdated chairs and tables. It's not as important as the food obviously, but it would be nice to update the inside.

Try it out!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, I wasn't sure if it was open, hardly anyone inside. I tried chicken shawarma wrap and rice. I didn't really see the rice as a side on the menu but I asked for it. It had zero taste. My toddler usually eats the rice at other Lebanese restaurants (The kind with vermicelli and cinnamon in it) but this she wouldn't touch and it ended up getting thrown out. The sandwich was nothing I'd come back for, it wasn't terrible but I've had much better elsewhere. I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant on the planet! What a discover a few short months ago and right around the corner from us! I can't give you many specifics because everything is delicious ! First do the stuffed grape leaves and branch out from there! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Outrageous.  
By far and away the finest Lebanese food in an hundred mile radius.  All of their food is correctly seasoned, and meticulously prepared.  I savor Arabic cuisine - Tarboosh Eatery gets it.  I am dying to try the kibbee nayeh - they're so concerned about having fresh meat that they rarely have it.  You must call them.  That is what I mean when I write that they get it.  

If you enjoy this cuisine, or want to try the real thing, go here when you are in Parma.  You'll be delighted."}
{"text":"Anyone working or living in this area, check this place out.  We have eaten Middle East food all over the world including the Middle East and these tastes are fabulous.  Great hummus, Kibbee, falafel, just didn't charge me for the hot sauce which was some of the best!"}
{"text":"Great casual lebanese restaurant in parma.  The chicken tawook and mujhadara plate were delicious.  The delicious sambocas are like hybrid samosa spring rolls and the pita nachos are just as they sound.  The namura dessert is very sweet coconut pastry.  I think the best item was the mujhadara plate.  I'd like to try the lamb shank next time as they did not have it today.  The entrees are between 9 to 16$ and appetizers between 6-10$.  Its a very affordable place serving fresh and flavorful food."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Excellent hummus and the lentil soup is a great side. Very clean, relaxing environment and great service. This place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"was in the mood for fresh hummus. Not as good as aladdin's. They skimped on the portion. the large order was barely enough to share. They spread it thin in a big container to make it look like plenty but really there was not much in the to go
box!  I ordered extra pita but I guess didn't need it . Forgot to ask
for hot sauce , it did not come with it. I was pretty bummed."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Im a vegetarian so I am always looking for fresh healthy places too eat. This is it!!! The family is so kind and welcoming and they make you feel at home. I am a heavily tattooed woman and many small ethnic restaurants give me looks based on the fact that their cultures dont get tattooed. This never happened here. On the contrary they have always been wonderful! A favorite of mine is the baba ganooj. The smokey flavor is heavenly!! They will make meatless options for you if you ask. The fatoosh salad is a favorite of mine. Try the felafels, dip them in hummus or baba.  True they do have a small staff, but the quality of the food, graciousness and general gratitude to you for choosing them to dine at out weigh any wait."}
{"text":"I've been here once and it has some really good food. I had the beef Shwarma and it was great. If this place was closer to where i lived I probably would go here all the time."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and delish. The Baba was perfectly blended, humus creamy, extra virgin light olive oil drizzles with paprika sprinkles...so tasty. Shared the Lrg Sampler #3 & a Pitza- Shwarma...yumyum. Tabouli, Tzatziki, Vegitarian Options, Garlic, Curry, Turkish Coffee, Baklava. Flavor Explosion of nom-nom heaven."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Better than Aladdin's and they try to locally source as much as possible.  More affordable than Aladdin's also.  

Only negative is that they are very under staffed so you may end up waiting a while.

Wish they did smoothies and fresh juice like Aladdin's.  Then I would be a 100% convert."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday evening around 6pm.  They were not very busy at all, and we were able to be quickly seated. 

The menus was very good sized, offering a wide variety of options to meet anyone's pallet.  We first had the large sampler to get a try on several different items.  All of food we received was great.  The hummus tasted a bit different than we were used to, but not horrible. I would have like the portions to be a bit larger on the sampler. 

We then had the Chicken Tikka, and Lamb Kabobs.  Both were excellently prepared, and tasted fantastic.  I would have liked to had a larger portion of meat, but not a deal breaker. 

The service was fantastic.  We never felt neglected the entire evening, and the engagement of our waitress was enjoyable. 

The restaurant was clean and comfortable, and presented well.  From you he road, the looks are deceiving and I believe is why they were not busier.  

Great place for friends or family."}
{"text":"Tarboosh is pretty good. I try to tell my coworkers to venture off the beaten path and forgo another visit to Aladdin's and try something different and equally as good. I bought a variety of samplings from the menu and it all was good. The kibbeh was my favorite. Tarboosh will be one of my regular lunch stops now that I will be forced to remain indoors for the winter. I will miss taking my walks around Independence."}
{"text":"This place is awesome as usual. Some of the best tasting/ healthy/ inexpensive meals around. The family that owns the place are such sweet and caring people!"}
{"text":"The space is very new and very clean and tidy. Friendly staff greet you and make you feel welcome right away. They were also helpful with recommendations on lunch specials. I had lentil soup and the grilled salmon pita. It was good. I didn't jump through the ceiling after eating it but I would have this again. For some reason I didn't feel that the salmon was very fresh. Nonetheless it was still good with the veggies they put along side it. I'll review again when I have a full dinner. I would recommend to give this place a try."}
{"text":"This area is starting to yield some nice eating establishments as of late. I opted to call in my order. The menu seems like the typical meditarranean fare and prices were comparable to others in Cleveland. It's a small place, with perhaps six tables. Upon entry, it looked like they may be building an ice cream section, but it was unplugged and no one manning the area. The restaurant looked clean. I got a fattoush salad with chicken. Choose between a large and small. I went for the large but could probably have eaten two of them ( I would honestly call that a medium serving). Ingredients were fresh. Dressing on the side for take out, only one but it is enough. I don't think it really sets itself apart from any other places here (Cedar land, Aladdin's, Sittoo's or Taza), they have all been very good. But for me I love how it is in my neighborhood and has a parking lot!"}
