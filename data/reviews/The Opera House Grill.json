{"text":"Its sad. This place started off on the right track and has suddenly taken a bad turn and not by accident. When I first started coming here the food was quite good. Well seasoned and in some ways unique. Suddenly things started to change and everything started to taste very ordinary and in some ways less than ordinary.  When I discussed it with the owner he said that he was trying to make it more main stream to appeal to a broader market which meant less flavour and more what you can get anywhere. My response to him was if you can get this crap anywhere, why would anyone bother to come here. When you were unique their was a reason to come here, now I may as well go to McDonalds. When they first opened they had a lot of energy and seemed on the right track, now the lack of knowledge and skill is starting to show through. I'm sure they will do well this summer because of the large patio. But when summer is over and the patio is closed, no one will be coming for the food. Not a place you would go out of your way for and if you got tickets for an event at the Opera House, eat some where else."}
{"text":"I seemed to have a much different experience than people talk about on here.  First, the positives.  After wandering on Queen Street from Greenwood going west, this was one of the only places we ever found with a patio.  So now, in this beautiful weather, it's a major advantage for this place.  Also, the food was really reasonably priced for a neighbourhood that is getting expensive.  Now the negatives - our service was absolutely terrible on a very quiet afternoon.  I believe the woman taking care of us just routinely forgot what we asked for.  Also, not a huge fan of the generic beer can or wine selection.  Overall, I find this place to be decent enough to sit on the patio and have a snack on, but hardly a hidden gem in a very busy section of town.  I'd go back if I was walking by but would never make the trip out to go here.."}
{"text":"Best fucking burger in the city!!!! So good. Greatest family buissness in the city :)"}
{"text":"This place is close to my work and I pop by from time to time. I've never had an issue. The prices are great and the food is delicious. Their patio is cute and I love that they now have board games to play with! Haven't played with any yet, but you can bet I'll be back soon to give it a whirl.   The ladies that handle the cash are always super friendly, so it's pretty enjoyable popping in there every now and then. Keep it up! Not many healthy options in the area, so this is a great option for me.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I go to the Opera house grill for lunch all the time! The food is always fresh and delicious, as well as portioned very generously. The staff are all very sweet and happy to see me, which makes me feel awesome. I never find myself waiting an unreasonable amount of time for my take-out to be ready, which is super important as I'm usually on break from work and in a rush. I'm also a bit of a picky eater, and they have never messed my order up at all.  The only thing I would caution people on, is they have a bit of a small menu. It's very \"Greek influenced\" which is great, but it does limit the variety of meals available. Also, most mains do not include a side which I find a bit strange. Other than that, AMAZING.   The chicken fingers are the best!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burger and fry joint in the Queen East opera house. Friendly service makes it all the more personal and they have Greek poutine so that's a winner in my book no matter how you slice it.   Customize your burger, add extra feta and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant today after a fun day wedding dress shopping with two girl friends. We were in the area and starved after our long morning and decided to stop at this patio in the area for lunch.   When our food arrived my friend opened her burger and was shocked to find a live snail crawling across her burger.... The waitress was nice and brought her new food and removed her food from the bill.   Honestly, this is so far beyond acceptable for a restaurant we couldn't do anything but try and laugh it off. The waitress was kind and obviously it isn't her fail but the fake that a manager or chef didn't come to apologize and completely cover our meal is shocking. Our friend had to sit and pick at our meals until her new food came and when it finally did come she obviously didn't have an appetite anymore.   Definitely would not return or recommend."}
{"text":"I liked the burger. Lots of meat for a 5 dollar something burger. The bun is kind of sticky but I am in general happy. Very friendly waitress.   Also have souvlaki on the menu. Def a good spot for a quick bite before getting into the opera house for your show!"}
{"text":"I was very happy to be able to come in and enjoy the newly renovated grill.  this place is as good as it gets (5 stars...get it? LOL) having revamped everything from the inside to the outside, and the outdoor seating area, this place is a huge contender for all other restaurants in the area. offering Greek food and some other grill fare, this place has my nomination for a very good \"bang\" for the buck. the inside offers a glimpse of a section of past events that have taken place at the venue the grill is attached to, which when you take a look at the surroundings, the time it takes for the food to get to the table seems less then a minute.  I cannot stress that the wait staff/cooks have the best attitude on the planet, never afraid to offer up options or suggestions, and extremely eager to please. to the point where I witnessed everyone being treated the same(consistency is the name of the game) and no request was a bother at all. I ordered my food and sat down with a friend who was just keeping me company, when the food arrived, even though all of the food was for me, extra plates were brought over, extra cutlery, extra napkins, and extra water for my friend and I. everything arrived hot, fresh, and supremely flavorful. the cashier checked in with me twice to see that everything was ok with the food, and drinks, and even took care of the table after I was done eating (huge points here) its nice, its cozy, and its delicious.  the place is spotless on the inside, with enough indoor seating to fit about ten people, parking is on the street if you can find it(if a concert isn't playing) and very transit friendly.  with a pretty much 12 hour opening, there's always a time to come eat here!  I wish everyone would go out of the way to eat at this little grille. they really stepped up the game with the renovations and the proof is in the food.  one of my highest recommendations for food in the city, and I don't mean that lightly, I cant wait to come back when I attend concerts next door, or just cause I can."}
