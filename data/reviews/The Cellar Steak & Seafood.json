{"text":"Such good food and great experience! Food was absolutely delicious. My husband really wanted the duck but also the gnocchi and was completely torn...and then the server offered to combine the two. What?! Of course it was perfect to the point where hubby wanted to lick the plate...I politely asked him not to even though I wanted to do the same. My steak was very tender and seasoned perfectly. The meal was a bit on the cold side when it came out but the taste made up for that. Very happy about the service and whole experience. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great place!! We came here for our anniversary dinner and splurged and had the platter for two ($150) along with soup (the croutons-yum!!) and dessert (carrot cake was so so). Coffee was good and the monte cristo coffee was delicious. Overall the food was great! Our waitress ShaRon was great! and we will definitely be coming back!   Tip: don't wear heels because you need to go down stairs to the restaurant. As far as I know there is no elevator.  Parking: free parking on the street."}
{"text":"We had a great meal tonight as a birthday celebration for my wife's 40th, perfect location and romantic setting.  We had the \"The Platter For Two\" and loved every bite.  The scallops, Lobster tail, Black Tiger shrimp were all cooked to perfection, especially with a nice bottle of Malbec to compliment it.  We finished the meal and then had probably the biggest desert of our lives... \"The Cellar Sundae\".  It was presented in a huge martini glass and was soooo good.  I suggest you make the drive to Georgetown and enjoy this fantastic restaurant!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place.  I strongly recommend the dinner for two.  That's what my wife and I always get.  Tons of left overs.   Everything is always cooked perfectly.  ."}
{"text":"in a word: WOW!  was invited for dinner by a local, and i'm thrilled i ventured outside my regular haunts...  this little (15 tables?) restaurant in tucked nicely into the basement of an old bank. exposed brick walls and warm wood make the place nice and cozy...  greeted by a wonderful staff that made us feel at home right away...  quick martini in their bar/foyer and on to our table...in what used to be the bank's vault! (too cool...great private little room)  the menu was wonderful - great selection of apps, entrees, and daily specials (we sampled 3 or 4 apps amongst the entire table and all were excellent - lobster mac & cheese was divine!)  great (varied) wine list too with something for all tastes and budgets!  feature of the day was prime rib with yorkshire pudding (i'm a sucker for a good prime rib)  top notch - especially when i asked for, and received an outside cut, med rare... simply delicious...  my fellow patrons had a variety - swordfish, ribeye with lobster, ny strip...all done to perfection  needless to say we were all impressed and will return - SOON!  thank you chef brady for a wonderful experience!  5 stars (easily!)"}
