{"text":"Tried to get lunch here and there were two people working. Only one was doing anything and took so long to even get my order taken that I needed up leaving without eating."}
{"text":"Mmmmm. Once you try this brisket you will never want to buy it from anywhere else. It is the best!"}
{"text":"Bbq done well and good prices too! Brisket, pulled pork and turkey were all well received and enjoyed. Baked beans were very flavorful, cornbread was as moist and delicious as any I've had and a nice big portion. Macaroni and cheese was not the best I've had but very good. We are not the biggest sweet potato fans so they were not to our liking, but if you are a fan you should try them, they are flavorful with a little chipotle kick. I almost liked them! As an added plus is they play the blues!!"}
{"text":"I don't get to Ambridge often but I'd have no problem stopping in again if I'm in the mood for BBQ.  My table got the Brisket, Turkey and Pulled Pork with cornbread, Mac n chz, baked beans and both types of cole slaw.  All the meats were flavorful.  I liked the HOT sauce but it was too hot for everyone else at my table.  The baked beans were delicious.  The Mac n Chz was gone before I could try any.  I liked the creamy cole slaw but wouldn't get the vinegar based one again.  We had a coupon which made it all so much better.  My only complaint is just a personal thing that I don't like seeing my food get put on a scale to make sure I get the exact portion. I understand why it's done and I can't argue against it, I just don't like it."}
{"text":"Nice little independent place. Sadly, I didn't get to try the brisket because it was all sold out.  I like that way of doing things because you know you're getting fresh meat.  Had a nice visit with the owner while eating. A solid four stars here!"}
{"text":"I just ate at ODBQ for the first time just minutes ago.  This food is completely amazing.  I got brisket, pulled port, corn bread and mac and cheese.  The Best!!!  Great service, great price, fantastic eats!"}
{"text":"Brisket was incredible! Also had the turkey which was wicked juicy and full of flavor. Cole slaw was delicious. Homemade sauces were super on point. Finally found good Q in the burgh. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Just tried ODBQ for the first time today. Finally REAL bbq in western pa! I had their brisket and vinegar slaw. The best brisket I've had, no sauce needed to cover up for dry over cooked meat. The brisket was so tender and flavorful with just the pepper they apply before they smoked it. I got a chance to talk to the owner, James, for a bit and you could tell he takes great pride in what he does, and rightfully so. I will definitely be back and will tell a few friends."}
{"text":"This BBQ is fantastic. Moist delicious brisket, great pulled pork. Try all of the sauces excellent flavors. I did take out and my 3 boys (Twin 9 olds and a 3 year old)crushed it all. Good prices and nice serving sizes. The owner was great to talk to as well. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Yessssss! Just go! Affordable, great BBQ. Wonderful smoked meat, add sauce as you need. Great potato salad and mac n cheese! I regularly get a solid meal for my husband and I, locally, and under $20."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding!!! Best BBQ around. The owner and staff are always real friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I have been to ODBQ in person twice now and I have enjoyed a take out meal a third time at a friend's house. Every experience has been excellent. I can't say enough about the beef brisket, pulled pork,ribs,and every side I've had so far...I've tried the slow cooked baked beans, the potato salad, the garlic mashed potatoes, the pasta salad, the creamy coleslaw, and the homemade cornbread...(I'm working through the list.) The owner was not only friendly, but he also spent time talking to me about our son in the military and was very kind and supportive. This place is a local treasure ! Ambridge is all the better for it. I will be returning."}
{"text":"We have ordered take out from here several times and been happy every time. My husband is astounded by how reasonably priced this place is (we are used to downtown Pittsburgh prices). I liked the chicken and the mac n cheese. My husband has tried just about everything on the menu and never complained."}
{"text":"I was finally able to try the food here, and I'll definitely be back! The brisket was tender and flavorful, and mac and cheese was tasty. Big portions of sides too! All for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"If you live anywhere near Ambridge and love great BBQ you have to try ODBQ. Easy to get to, parking available, good prices and fantastic BBQ and home made sides.   All of the meats are very good but I think the brisket is as good as it gets.  I don't think I've ever had better.  Definitely worth a visit!!!!"}
{"text":"Husband & I felt the turkey was the best and most tender.  Brisket was kind of fatty. Pulled pork good.  The baked beans are good, but beware they are a bit spicy.  Avoid the cherry cobbler; very disappointing. Homemade mac 'n cheese was good also"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!  No idea when it opened but I plan on eating here often.  Food is so good.  Guy at the counter was extremely nice and helpful.  Excited to go back....currently in a food coma"}
{"text":"ODBQ knocks it out of the ball park!  Definitely the best brisket I've ever eaten. Generous portions... seasoned to perfection, along with side dishes to match.   Clean and friendly environment with (what seemed to be) many satisfied returning patrons.   After driving from Columbus, Ohio... it was a well rewarded treat for dinner. The customer ahead of me, was from Texas... and even he seemed very impressed with the various meats offered on the menu.  The next time I'm in the area, I know where I'll be eating... ODBQ!"}
{"text":"I would have never believed it. Before they opened I told them that \"in this area BBQ ment a slab of ribs from the grill and a side of sour-kraut\". Boy did they prove me wrong. Best BBQ food and sides I have ever tasted, and by the looks of it I'm  not alone. Best of luck to you my friend keep up the good work and quality product. Another in a string of new small  restaurants that make proud to be from Ambridge."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Very quick with orders. Just wish the meat portions were a bit bigger. But overall, very good BBQ."}
{"text":"Came in here on a whim because the reviews looked good. Ordered the Brisket, it was so flavorful and tender, I also opted to get the Mac n' cheese and sweet potatoes. I highly recommend the Brisket and Mac n' cheese. The owner's name is James he was very polite and friendly. I will definitely be back. Try the cornbread!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place. Service was very good. Owner clearly takes pride in his food and the place was very clean. Food however,... Excellent. Only thing better than the food, were the prices. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Had catering from here and I'm sorry to say it, but I was not thrilled with the food. The cornbread was good. I found the Mac n cheese bland and the brisket and pulled pork to be fatty. I'll probably give them a second chance and go to the store but there's no rush."}
{"text":"Not only is this the best BBQ Brisket I ever had... ODBQ is owned by a US Veteran! And boy can he smoke a brisket!  It is so tender and each bite melts in your mouth!  As tender as it is,  it even slices and isn't in shreds.  Each slice is a piece of culinary art!  Western PA is not known for BBQ or brisket....but hopefully ODBQ will change that!    Prices are great too!  Why pay over $5 for a Big Mac when you can have amazing Angus brisket for $5? Although I didn't purchase any sides, they looked nice and fresh.    Slow and low....smoked to perfection barbecue!  Word of advice...order just a bit more than you think you will eat because yinz will want another serving! Yum!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem for great BBQ. While in town recently I quickly realized that there weren't many good spots for lunch that weren't fast food. Lunch seemed to be a challenge for this girl who is gluten free but then low and behold I found ODBQ.  When I arrived I was greeted by the owner who was very friendly. This is a no frills straight to the point BBQ joint. Owner recommended the brisket which I came with two sides, I opted for sweet potatoes and beans. The meat is served sauceless but if you ask sauce is available. Quite honestly the meat is so damn flavorful that you really don't need any sauce. Everything was absolutely delicious and full of flavor. The beans and the sweet potatoes had a bit of a kick which I loved. The portions were very generous and I ended up having enough for a second meal. If you're in the area you should definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"I'd venture to say this is one of the best barbecue places in the greater Pittsburgh area.  The brisket and pulled pork are fantastically tender, and are served with the juices, which are rich and thick with rendered fat and collagen and make the texture of the meats smooth as buttah.  The sauces are fantastic (especially the super hot barbecue sauce, that's got quite the kick!), the sides are solid, and the prices are amazing.  Barbecue in western PA might have a long way to go before it can compare with the likes of Texas or the Carolinas, but this place is taking us in the right direction."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed....50 percent of the sides where crossed out. Lacked a good portion of proteins. Owner/Cook incridebly rude. Don't waste your time with this establishment."}
{"text":"Its legit, had all the meats, pulled pork, turkey & brisket and I was very impressed! Finally some legit BBQ in the area...and his homemade sauce is awesome too! Extremely nice guy, go check it out, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If you are from Texas, this place will take you back there. Some of the best brisket I have ever had. Pulled pork was awesome, sauces were homemade, and sides were great."}
{"text":"Original review below still stands. Was here two more times and food was still excellent.  Just wanted to update that they made the menu inside 100X easier to understand.  I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"So, so good.  I am a die hard Carolina BBQ fan, and usually I can only get my fix with a visit south.  This place is insanely delicious!  The pulled pork is my favorite, but you can tell it's all made with care and pride - crucial for BBQ, in my opinion.  This place is the worst thing for my diet because the food is so good - when I see that open sign I can't turn away.  However, I did try the carrots in place of the mac and cheese and they were delicious. That's a healthy choice, right?    May I recommend the 'Blues BBQ' radio station on Pandora to up the ambiance?    Thanks for opening your restaurant in Ambridge - a great addition to our little town.  We've had some business owners really upping their game here in Ambridge and I LOVE that.  Who has to drive into the city with some cool restaurants and bars right in your backyard?"}
{"text":"I love this place.  James, the owner and cook, is a down to Earth guy who's always welcoming for any conversation.  As for the food, they really speak for themselves.  The flavor, the texture, the aroma, the AMOUNT, all come together in one harmonious taste of heaven. This place is a bit out of the way for me (at least 20 minutes drive each way) but I will always come back as long as I'm in Pittsburgh.  The brisket is to die for! And the sauces!  Let's not forget them juicy homemade sauces that complement the meat. My favorite sauce is called Stupid which is stupidly hot yet tempts you to drink it. I highly recommend ODBQ, I guarantee you will leave satisfied! Thank you James, thank you for being so great at what you do."}
{"text":"SO YUMMY!!!! Literally everything that we had from the brisket to the coleslaw was really good! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"Perhaps I went on an off-day.  I made a special trip because of the amazing Yelp reviews, but it was a two-star meal for me.  Added a star because all of you yelpers can't be THAT wrong.  I will give it another shot.  Very nice little restaurant in Ambridge with a friendly ex-roughneck from NW Texas. Compared to some of the dives in Ambridge, this place gets kudos for atmosphere.  Trendy exposed brick and clean tables, brightly lit.  I got a meat and three, with sweet potatoes, beans and Mac n cheese.  The Brisket was amazing, but the sides were sorely lacking.  The meat was incredibly tender and succulent.  Melts in your mouth.  The owner knows what he is doing when it comes to a smoker.  The sides, however, were beyond mediocre.  The mac n cheese was of the custard variety-not my favorite- but lacked the sharpness that makes some great.  A little Swiss or sharp cheddar would go a long way to flavor the bland, boring side.  The sweet potatoes were mashed, but again, pretty bland.  Lacked salt and a bit dry.   The beans were... Say it with me.... Bland.  Way too dry, lacking any appreciable spice or spiciness.  Just tasted like overcooked canned beans.   I will definitely try ODBQ again because of previous reviews.  If it were not for them, I would never return."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  This is authentic barbeque, it makes you feel like you are in the south.  We had the turkey and the pulled pork, both were delicious and the sides...soooooo good!  Mac and cheese, baked beans, potato salad, corn bread.  Everything was fabulous.  I don't know how to change the $$ rating, but in my opinion, it is a (1) $.  I thought it was very reasonable, especially for the portion sizes.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow. Just went here for the first time and will absolutely be back. The only downside is it's 20-25 minutes to get there from my home, but the drive was worth it. Tried the turkey, brisket and pulled pork with cornbread, beans and mac & cheese. All of it was great. Great service (the owner served me, I think) and great food? What's not to like."}
{"text":"I am reluctant to give 5 stars as I am afraid he will run out of the brisket before I get there!!! Phenomenal bbq!  Not real close to where I live but I don't hesitate to make the trip."}
{"text":"The barbecue brisket is on point. The mashed sweet potatoes, well, can't get enough of them. The brisket is so good, I haven't tried anything else yet.  I've been about four times, every time it's great... very consistent. Friendly owner.  Prices are good too.  I lived in Texas until 2005 (45 years) and ate a lot of brisket while I was there. It's better than most of the brisket I ever ate in Texas.  Highly recommend, y'all."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. Nothing better than homemade slow cooked BBQ. Great customer service as well!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best BBQ in Beaver County if not a bigger radius!  The food is bursting with flavor without covering it up with sauce.  Depending on your taste buds as sauce is not needed, but I know someone like their saucy, so know the sauce is good as well!  Friendly owner with great service.  This is a great place for lunch/dinner/Catering.  Thank you for bringing this wonderful food to Beaver County!"}
{"text":"Well let me be honest. I haven't been, but plan to. But I can say with pride,  I've proudly known the owner for over 20 years from the United States Air Force. And even back then his bbq skills were unbelievable. Hope to get there soon as I am from upstate New York."}
{"text":"I picked up ODBQ for lunch today and it was fantastic.  I got the brisket and pulled pork with a side of mac and cheese.  The brisket was probably the best I've had in Pittsburgh and the pulled pork was no slouch either.  I had the carolina gold sauce with the pork and it was really good.  Probably the best part was the price point.  I'm sick of places charging $20 for half as much food that's half as good as I got at ODBQ for $10."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for great BBQ close to home. ODBQ does not dissapoint, it exeeds my expectations.  I have been to Texas a few times & this new place tastes like being there.  For my first visit I had the Brisket, sweet potato & Mac n cheese & a piece (basically a mini loaf) of cornbread. All cooked to perfection, I was lucky enough to get the burnt ends.  3 choices of sauces although super hot not for me you can savor the flavor without any just fine. Can't wait to get back to try pulled pork & turkey.  The restaurant is small - seating for about 20-25 , clean & functional.  If you like BBQ you will love this place!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome little BBQ joint in Ambridge. The pulled pork, brisket, and mac and cheese were all delicious! Ask to try one of their 5 BBQ sauces"}
{"text":"We all seek out the perfect inverse relationship between quality and prices; ODBQ does not fail.  The food is as good as BBQ as you'll find in the Pittsburgh area and additionally, is incredibly affordable and makes for a fantastic lunch.  The chef and proprietor is very conversational and it'll be a great time.   Just go there and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"A wonderful place for BBQ. I'm so happy to finally have somewhere close by that doesn't rely on frozen food, they don't even own a microwave!  We got smoked turkey, brisket, pulled pork, Mac n cheese, pasta salad, carrots, two drinks and our bill was under $20. Everything was so good, my favorite was the turkey. Not overly smoky with just the right amount of spices. We grill and smoke often at home and this restaurant exceeded our expectation. The owner is very sociable and chatted with the patrons the entire time.  You can tell he has worked extremely hard to make this place happen. I love it here, charming place with excellent food, try it out!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great price & courteous service. Give'em a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review for weeks, but keep getting busy and pushing it off... However, it needs to be said - this place has the best bbq in Pittsburgh! I was shocked to come home to Ambridge and be met with this caliber of food. The brisket and pork are amazing, and the sides are ridiculous! It may be the best sweet potato mash I've ever had, and it's honestly the best baked beans by far (and I don't even like baked beans, I just got them at the owners suggestion). I went down to pick the food up to bring back to my grandparents, and happily engaged the owner with conversation about his preparations. Bless this man for the amount of time and care he puts into everything! He did his homework, and I'm not joking in saying that you can \"taste the love\" in what he creates. Plus, for the quality of product, the amount he gives you, and incredibly reasonable $$ he charges for it, it is beyond amazing! Seriously, so good. I've been telling people all over the city that it's worth the trek to Beaver County for this one."}
