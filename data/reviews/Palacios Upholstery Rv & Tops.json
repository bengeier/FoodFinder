{"text":"Jessie is a master in his profession!  I took him an old RV and it came out looking amazing.  All new upholstery and a new entertainment center.  The value I got for my money was beyond what I could have expected.  Thanks Jesse!"}
{"text":"We found Palacios on Yelp (Yelp has yet to steer me wrong) when we were looking to repair the leather pouches on the back of the seats in our SUV. We were preparing to sell the car and both pouches had ripped completely off and were hanging from the bottom.

The woman at the front desk had one of the guys take a look immediately, quoted me $175 and told me they could have it done within the week. Deal. They were a couple of days later than they initially told me (and I had to call them to find out if the job was done), but they did great work and the seats look perfect again. The bill came to $155 (always refreshing when a business comes in under their quote).

 Excellent quality work, I would go back to Palacios with any other leather/upholstery job, no question."}
{"text":"very great customer service, the lady who answered the phone I didn't get her name was very helpful will deff be taking my furniture here.!"}
{"text":"Great place! They have redone several of my boats.  Awesome work, super price.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had hardwood floors installed in my RV. They also reupholstered my couch and bench seats in leather. The price was right and the work was fantastic! I went back a year later for a them to install a flat screen and refinish some cabinets. Could not have been happier with the results. Great family business."}
{"text":"Nearly two years later and the other seat split. Jesse not only made my seat look new again, he rushed the job and finished in two hours so I could make it back uptown in time for a lunch meeting. They were busy, too, so I know this was extra effort on their part. Palacios is personal, efficient, reasonable and friendly. No need to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Palacios for auto upholstry repair.  The quality of their work is excellent and their customer service exceeded my expectation!  I just called to schedule a repair on my other vehicle."}
{"text":"I was referred to Palacio's by a friend who had them put a wood floor in his R.V.  I have a 4x4 van and wanted the seats rearranged for my kids and for camping.  Jesse was friendly, and worked with me to get the price into a range my wife could tolerate.  Haha!  We only did half the work so far, but I am more than pleased.  Even my wife said to me, \"Wow honey.  It looks really nice.\"  I would definitely recommend Palacio's."}
{"text":"My name is Patricia Bustamante and I rating Palacios 5 Stars with no reservations. The quality of work is superior. The staff is friendly, helpful, and professional. I brought my car to have my car aeat, and one rest arm reupholstered. The work looks brand new. I highly recommend Palacios for those customers looking for high quality work."}
{"text":"Searched numerous upholstery places and was reluctant because someone reviewing on Google said they were unhappy with the quality of work recently.  However, out of numerous upholstery places (some of which never returned my calls or emails) Palacios had the shortest turn around time and the same price quote ballpark.  Additionally, they were the most prompt responding to my emails.  I decided to have them reupholster an accent chair with a complicated pattern and we couldn't be happier with the quality of work.  They also were able to rush the reupholstery process, so the chair was available for a party.  I would recommend them and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Anna at Palacios was a delight to work with. She expedited the reupholstery of our two mid-century occasional chairs, and she was so patient with us as we selected a cat-proof material (textured vinyl that looks like tweed!) for the cushions. Palacios mimicked the original style of cushion wrapping and piping and finished ahead of schedule. Palacios also offered the most competitive estimate of all ten we received through Yelp."}
{"text":"A great place at reasonable prices. Had 2 different projects completed here... Took my restored 1962 Shasta camper seats here, had them make new ones for me. I bought the foam, they did the upholstery. Way better than I expected, super professional job, and I was more than happy! Then, I took my tall patio chairs in to be recovered, and they did another perfect job. They look fantastic. Friendly staff, super thorough. highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I had a chair redone here. They were so nice and knowledgeable. I loved the choices they had and they helped me to pick out something awesome for the chair. I will be having more done soon."}
{"text":"We took 2 of our Mercedes to Palacios to have a seat repaired on one and the center console arm rest recovered on the other.  They did a fantastic job and both cars look brand new. They gave us an estimate on Friday and started the work on Monday.  Jesse and Anna did a great job of communicating the progress and both cars were done in 2 days.  We are planning on taking another car in soon.

They are fast, courteous and their work is fantastic."}
{"text":"Family owned-business. Easy to find, great work and excellent customer service!!

I was looking for a place that could help me put in a grommet on a college mascot flag. I first went to Paul's Ace Hardware because they are great - always so helpful. Unfortunately, they would have to sell me the grommet AND the tool to put it in. I really didn't want to buy the tool since it would be for only one use. 
So I headed out for an upholstery shop and found Palacio's. Not only did he install the grommet while I waited but refused to charge me anything. They recognize the value of word-of-mouth advertising and, in my experience, those are the businesses that provide the best work and customer service."}
{"text":"Took my 1964 GTO conv. in for a new top. 

1. The lady behind the counter has Fuzzy math! Caught her attempttng to add an extra $400 on to the bill, she later apologized for her bad math. 

2. upon lowering the top for the 1st time, my glass window shattered. Palacios refused to stand by their work. 
DO NOT TRUST THEM WITH YOUR CAR!"}
{"text":"My husband and I took our travel trailer to Jesse at Palacios Upholstery a couple of weeks ago. I read many great reviews on Yelp and called to schedule an appointment.  I didn't like the fabric on our jackknife & dinette cushions and wanted to change it.  I couldn't go with my husband to pick up the trailer, and when I got home from work, I was very pleased except for two things.  I called and spoke to Jesse and he said to bring it back in and they'd take care of it.  Probably for most people, they wouldn't have noticed anything, but unfortunately I am pathetically picky.  We were so pleased with their ethics and professionalism that we decided to have the tear in the driver seat of our Jeep Grand Cherokee fixed as well.  So yesterday we took the Jeep and the trailer back down and both were fixed the same day and we were extremely pleased with the work.  Jesse put a rush on this as he knew we were moving out of state in two weeks and we had a lot going on.  He also thanked me for pointing out the two issues I had and apologized for not catching it himself, but like I said, most people wouldn't have even noticed.  What a great business owner...professional and ethical.

I would highly recommend Palacios Upholstery."}
{"text":"Professional in every way!! Jesse and his staff completely remodeled my 2004 35' A class motorhome and it looks amazing. The price was fair and the work was beautiful. Jesse had great ideas and the extra touches were amazing. If you want your RV remodeled look no further than Palacios."}
{"text":"Ana is a dishonest business women. I ordered custom sheepskin seat covers. She tried to pass of I'll fitting cheap version. After several weeks of VERY unpleasant interaction she reordered then . They are a better fit but still feel the quality is not what I expected or what I had gotten there before. I will never do business with them again"}
{"text":"Frank and Anna are super fair and super great work for me. I am a repeat customer and recommend them to anyone looking for superior work at a great price!!"}
{"text":"I have had work done by Palacios Upholstery twice - great work each time.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Super people. I took a \"boot cover\" for my 1969 Fiat convertible in for repair; they fixed the item at a great price; quick service too!"}
{"text":"This company is fantastic. I had a small tear in an outdoor cushion. I took it in, expecting to have to leave it. They repaired it on the spot in less than five minutes and the price was unbelievable! I recommend this company highly."}
{"text":"Revision: Owner issued apology for the experience, so I giving a better rating based on that. The experience was still not favorable after taking my grandmother's car in to get a quote to replace the headliner. I was told it would be $400.00 and would need to pay $70.00 to order the material. No big deal. I ordered the material and waited a week. Three days later, the car was in an accident and totaled. When I called to get my money back I was told its non-refundable. (I completely understand if it is policy). When I called back a week later asking to pick up my fabric, I was informed it was not there. Overall, it was a $65.00 life lesson."}
