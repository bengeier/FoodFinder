{"text":"By far the best bubble tea place - Panna Cotta is my favourite!"}
{"text":"Finally Bubble Republic has expanded to downtown Toronto! I was excited to hear about the Pre-Grand Opening this weekend and got to try out their new Panna Cotta Black Milk Tea recommend by the friendly staff. It fit exactly what I asked for which was a bubble tea that wasn't overly heavy. I found the tea to have enough flavour and this will now be my go to drink until they have their Caramel Pudding Milk Tea available.

The store was quite busy with their free small Orignal Black Milk Tea promotion but the service was still quick and efficient. The place was more clean and tidy compared to other bubble tea locations in the same vicinity. Overall, my visit was very pleasant and comfortable.

I'm looking forward to when they will be serving food like the Mississauga locations. Unil then I'm quite satisfied with their current selection. Definitely will be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday when they had a promo for Strawberry black tea ($3.69 for large). I got it with mixed tapioca and the total came to approximately $4.70. Like most bubbletea places nowadays, they let you customize the toppings and ice & sugar levels. The drink flavour/quality was not superb or anything that much better than other bubbletea places. Pretty average. 

There wasn't a long line up when I went because it wasn't during a busy time or a rush. The wait time to pick up the drink, after ordering, was less than 5 minutes. 
It's a clean little place that isn't too crowded. There are a few chairs and tables but still very little sitting. It's great for takeout though."}
{"text":"Tried the sesame noodles. It was a reasonably sized bowl of noodles in a thick peanut and presumably sesame sauce with carrot and cucumber toppings and a marinated egg on the side. Will I try it a second time? Definitely not. The peanut sauce was way more than I can enjoy and the egg was cooked too hard and it tasted kind of oldish."}
{"text":"Too expensive. Drinks average at least $5. At least two better quality and less expensive options within 2 blocks (Chatime and Bubble Tease) means they have to do something spectacular to draw in customers! Even their daily special is more expensive than a usual drink at Chatime ($4.19). The only one I would come for is the strawberry cheese chiller during the summer as a special expensive treat. The owner is really nice though so I want them to succeed - but without having lower prices, it's gonna be tough!"}
{"text":"I am familiar with Bubble Republic in Mississauga, so I was glad to see the familiar bubble tea chain near my mom's condo on Bay and Dundas. I find their bubble teas to be on the milkier side, which I like. I also like the fact that they have a daily special bubble tea, so you can try new drinks that are out of your normal \"comfort zone.\" Service was prompt and friendly. I would come back."}
{"text":"Yum yum! On my first visit I noticed that they had a lot of unique drinks like tiramisu chiller, panna cotta milk tea, orea milk tea etc! I quickly decided on panna cotta because the daily special was strawberry black tea which is meh to me. It was comparably priced to Chatime which had too long of a lineup! I didnt realize the drink came with actual panna cotta so I added large tapioca. It was quite good! Subtle but noticeable difference in taste in a good way and with 30% sugar it was just right. The panna cotta topping was like creamy grass jelly and no complaints on the tapioca either!"}
{"text":"By far the best customer service I've ever gotten. Quality of the tea was high in the tea we ordered, which was the Panna Cotta Tea. When a friend of mine dropped their cup of bubble tea, the kind baristas replenished it without question, making my friend feel incredibly welcomed. My friend decided that due to the trouble caused by the incident, she would give them 5 dollars, but they handed it back, saying it was alright. Hands down a must try."}
{"text":"Tea quality is definitely better than chatime or coco etc. Recommend black diamond milk tea(red bean, jelly, etc). Their milk tea is not overly sweetened either, 50% sugar here equals 30% sugar elsewhere. Service was very good."}
{"text":"I'm so glad there's a Bubble Republic downtown so close to Eaton Centre! I have gone a few times to the Mississauga location since I haven't been able to find anything like the Oatmeal Smash Milk Tea. Admittedly, I've already been here several times in the new year and loved their drinks every time. 

I usually prefer to order my drinks with 50% sugar since I find it a bit too sweet, and with less ice. The Oatmeal Smash has a nice crunch and a chocolatey, Milo-y taste along with milk tea. It's definitely a must-try if you haven't had it before. I appreciate that they have more than just your average drinks here if you're looking to venture beyond just original milk tea. I believe a small was $5 and the large was $6 without tapioca and taxes, and they only take cash or debit which is a bit frustrating. I've also tried some of the daily specials such as Taro Slush and Pana Cotta Milk Tea which are a great deal with the large being under $5. If only bubble tea was always this price... 

This location is a bit small with just a few tables; it's not the most comfortable but good if you want to stay a bit. Another thing to mention about this location is that the guy behind the counter (I've usually gone on the weekdays) is super friendly and always serves you with a smile and kind greeting."}
{"text":"One of my favourite bubble tea locations!

They have a lot of unique flavours and mixes compared to a lot of other places, and they're all pretty good!

If you're used to most bubble tea shops' sugar levels, you may be iffy about this place. They have reduced sugar levels on all their standard drinks inherently, but this is why I like this place so much. I usually halve the sugar content of every bubble tea place I go to, and I don't like having to guess how much to reduce it. This place has just the right amount for me. They also tend to make their milk teas with slightly higher milk ratios, which I don't mind actually, but it's something to keep in mind.
However, when it comes to more elaborate drinks, expect sugars to be high as usual. 

Whether or not you like this place will largely depend on what you order and how much of a sweet tooth you have, but it fits my cravings just right!"}
{"text":"There's a cluster of bubble tea spots in this area - Chatime, Presotea, Chaplus, Bubble Tease. Bubble Republic's menu is one of the more interesting places because they offer a lot of different toppings and creative drink options (though drinks can be pricier here than at other places).

Strawberry Cheese Chiller: A solid drink! It's less of a traditional bubble tea and more like a milkshake. Definitely go with 0% sugar because the base drink is already super sweet. I got mine with small tapioca - my favourite! I like the strawberry layer near the bottom of the drink as well.

Handcrafted Panna Cotta Black Milk Tea: The panna cotta topping is super tasty! It has a slight caramel flavour that adds a hint of sweetness to the drink. I got this with 0% sugar as well because I wanted to taste the basic milk tea to see what it was like. Overall, I think it has a distinctive flavour that makes it stand out from other bubble tea spots. It mixes with the black tea quite well, creating a smooth, smoky flavour."}
{"text":"Caramel pudding is A1. They finally decided to open one outside of the west end. 

Dammit Yelp why do you force me to write long reviews? I guess I'll say you can't go wrong with the Mango slush either. Imo BR has better quality bbt than the surround bbt stores."}
{"text":"Dropped by again after visiting ChaTime and it was full. Had a choice between this place and Bubbletease, but bubbletease was absolutely empty not even an employee in sight, so I decided to come here.

The store had a lot of seats available. The table up front had their usual skeleton sitting there. Good AC as well.

This time I tried the MC Milktea with regular sugar. MC stands for Malaysian Coconut, and you can't get it with no ice. The employee behind the counter explained what the milk tea is, and offered suggestions on how much sugar to add. When the drink arrived, she had also explained how to best prepare the drink by mixing it well before drinking it. Drinks are prepared pretty quickly, despite there being only two people behind the counter and one person's usually at the cash.

The drink was quite sweet, but tasted pretty good. Wonder how it would taste with half-sugar, since I usually don't get it too sweet. Overall a refreshing drink.

We also brought had uncle tetsu cheesecake in our hands and was planning to eat it there. They didn't seem to say anything about it, so that's pretty nice. Enjoyed our cakes and drinks until closing time."}
{"text":"I have tried three drinks at bubble republic and all were first rate.
The panna cotta in particular is one of the best bubble teas I've ever tried.
It really tastes like a panna cotta, the jelly tastes like pieces of panna cotta in a drinkable form.
5 stars!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I were drawn in by the free samples offered outside the store. He tried the mango green tea and had to immediately buy a large lol - good marketing! I however thought it was too sweet so stayed away. The two guys behind the counter were really nice."}
{"text":"After having recently tried the one in Missisauga, I was really excited to see that they opened up a new branch in the heart of my hometown, Toronto!

Unfortunately, the bubbletea did not live up to my standards at all. I had ordered a very standard jasmine milk green tea with tapioca and I ended up tossing it out with half of it remaining. And just to let you know, I typically hate wasting food so I had already tried my best to gradually sip at it during my 1.5hr stay at the store.

The tea was overwhelmingly milky and I could barely taste a hint of jasmine.. so you can see why that would be a problem for me when I'm lactose sensitive. The tapioca pearls were very sweet and overly chewy. Another thing I noticed was that I had ordered a small and my drink wasn't even filled up to the brim.. there was good 1 inch gap of nothing. 

Ehh, with all of the great bbt options nearby, I'm not sure I would come back here."}
{"text":"We ordered a milk tea smash oatmeal chiller with 30% sugar after supper and it turns out very good. Will definitely visit again to try more. Staff is friendly as well."}
{"text":"Finally, a place that makes hot bubble tea just the right temperature. Hot, but not scalding. Perfect. Owner is also super nice."}
{"text":"Came in during their soft opening because I've been wanting to try their bubble tea. They've been under construction for quite some time and finally opening up officially in mid June.  When we entered, we were greeted by a very friendly staff member. Helped us with our decision on what to order and told us about speciality drinks that they had that other places did not. Opted for the original milk tea with tapioca, grass jelly and red bean.  The tapioca were cooked to perfection- chewy and sweet.. the only down fall is the milk tea itself had no tea flavour to it... was very watered down and could barley taste the milk. Mind you, I did ask for half sweet.. but even with half sweet I would expect some kind of sweetness to my tea.. here I had none.. instead it just tasted like water down milk.  Quite dissappointing if original milk tea cannot be done properly at a bubble tea stop.

Although they are still working out their kinks before their grand opening.. I think I would rather go to the local chat time since I know the quality will be up to standard."}
{"text":"- small tapioca is A+
- matchamisu is A+
- 30 sugar actually tastes like 30 sugar
- strong tea flavor"}
{"text":"I always saw social media posts of this bubbletea joint but was never able to try it because of it being only located in Mississauga for some time. However, I was walking to Eaton Centre today and to my pleasant surprise, saw this location!! I went here after chowing down on some poke as I wanted a sweet ending to my lunch adventure. It was empty when I walked in at around 1:30PM. I decided to get the Saturday Special which is a large panna cotta black milk tea for $4.19 ($4.75 after tax). Its regular price is $5.50 so I think it was a good way to try something without spending toooo much. 

The drink was made right away and I honestly loved it. The tea was not too sweet or overpowering. Its subtle sweetness went really well with the sugary panna cotta topping. A really good balance that was definitely not overwhelming. Their \"regular\" sugar level is probably considered \"half sugar\" for Chatime's pearl milk tea, for this specific drink at least. They have a lot of different toppings here that are unique to other places such as the panna cotta of course, basil seeds, and ice cream!! Pretty much all the toppings are 50 cents extra. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my drink, the service was very friendly, the place itself was very clean and modern and the daily specials are definitely a great way to reel people in. Although a bitttt more expensive than other places, they at least grant you 2 vicinity points for a large drink purchase rather than 1 at all of the other bubbletea joints I've been to. I really do recommend trying Bubble Republic out!"}
{"text":"If I lived in Toronto, I'd probably pour a good amount of my paycheck into this place. It's a small café with a few tables serving bubble tea, shaved ice, and Taiwanese cuisine. They have pretty unique drinks here like their Smash Oatmeal Milk Tea, Matchamisu, Panna Cotta Milk Tea, Caramel Pudding Milk Tea that you probably wouldn't be able to find in other boba places.

The barista here is friendly and was really helpful when I was picking out drinks.  He let me sample a little of their panna cotta, which they make in house and use as a topping. It was a little sweet on it's own but well balanced when paired with their black milk tea. 

The black milk tea itself was on point.  This is how you know you've found a good bubble tea place."}
{"text":"Some great tapioca. Good if you want a less mainstream place for some bubble tea. Atmosphere is not amazing but will do."}
{"text":"Was very excited for this place to open downtown as the location in Mississauga is amazing!

However, I was a bit disappointed with our drink order. I ordered an Oreo milk tea, 70% sugar and regular ice. Although I asked for less sweet, I felt it lacked a lot more sweetness than just 70%. I was hoping for a refreshing slurp of bubble tea, but it was still a bit warm so I had to ask for more ice. The mini tapioca was a little over done and very mushy/soft. 

My friend got a honeydew milk tea. It looked like the same shade as \"ooze\" - LOL. It wasn't very sweet again, but my friend had asked for less sugar. It had a very powdery after taste.

The service was slow, but understandable as it seems like they've just opened. They still don't have some BR staples like caramel pudding milk tea yet, but signs say they're coming soon.

Overall, this place does not compare to the Mississauga location. However, I will return in hopes that they've worked out the kinks and refined their recipe."}
{"text":"Got the Monday's special Black Diamond Black Milk Tea for $4.75. Tasted like water, the black tapioca wasn't chewy enough, and the red bean was odd to be in the drink."}
{"text":"Clean and quiet little bubble tea place tucked in on Bay Street. It has a wide array of choices and a lot of dessert shakes! My boyfriend got the tiramisu shake with 50% sugar and it literally felt like drinking a tiramisu cake. Very decadent and a great drink for dessert. The portion size however, was way too big (they only offer once size for the dessert shakes). I would have liked a choice of size with different pricing.

I for my part got a small jasmine milk tea with 0% sugar and mini pearls. The drink was good at first but the more I drank, the creamier and heavier it got until it got too creamy to drink and I had to throw it out. I would LOVE to see an option of selecting the type of dairy to add to the drinks!

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place over Chatime."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: this review is solely based on their taro chiller w/ mini tapioca. Based on other reviews, it seems that their green/ black milk teas are mediocre. 

Bubble Republic has discounts on certain drinks depending on the day of the week. Since it was Tuesday, I got the large taro chiller w/ mini tapioca at 50% sugar. The taste of taro wasn't strong, but I liked how the texture resembled a thick smoothie. It wasn't overly sweet either, and the tapioca pearls (which were suitably slightly chewy) complimented the drink well. 

However, in terms of other drinks, it might be better to go when there's a discount."}
{"text":"I've been looking for this place forever! New one open here downtown can't wait to taste it."}
{"text":"Bubble Republic is a clean, open and airy feeling store with lots of seats and space for hanging out. We ordered a fruit tea with less sugar and less ice, it came quickly as we were the only people in the shop at the time. The drink was syrupy and nothing really stood out. It's an alright place, but there are other choices for tea in the area."}
{"text":"I believe there is a soft opening going on right now, but the official opening will be in early June.

First time at this place and ordered the staple green apple green tea. It's pretty flavourful and blended quite well. Since today was super hot, this was nice and refreshing. Having said that, it was also a nice touch to be asked how sweet and how much ice I preferred before assuming my order like other establishments. 

The inside was very clean with sufficient seatings. 

I'm looking forward to their food when it officially opens.

Will definitely make this my prime place to visit in that area.

My order came to be $3.80...not bad for a downtown location."}
{"text":"Finally! Glad to see BR closer to home, although everytime I'm in Mississauga I still stop by for a caramel pudding milk tea!

They've just had the grand opening over the weekend, everyone was working super hard.

I definitely recommend paying a visit once they've settled down... they currently don't have food items on the menu but perhaps will in the future."}
{"text":"Quite happy that they've opened this bubble tea shop in Toronto. We no longer have to go to Hurontario for our Caramel Pudding milk tea fix. However, I find their sugar levels quite strong for this drink. The 70% sugar tastes like full sugar. They've recently added a few food items. I tried the minced pork with rice and was pleasantly surprised with how great it tasted for only $5!"}
{"text":"\"Got the taro with small tapioca, 50% sugar. Too sweet. I think the tapioca is dipped in syrup. Way too sweet. I can't imagine what the 100% sugar would be. Artificial flavouring.\"

\"I can see why it's not busy.\"

- co-worker"}
{"text":"Good bubble tea place near Eaton Centre. They have two types of tapioca balls: regular size and small size. Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Been to the ones in Mississauga and this one is just as good. My favourite is the oatmeal smash milk tea with half sugar and no ice (came very chilled). Comes with oatmeal at the bottom which adds a nice crunch. Has a hint of malt flavour which reminds me of the ovaltine I had growing up."}
{"text":"I was craving bubble tea while walking downtown, and lo and behold I came across this place. 

My go to bubble tea drinks are either mango, passion fruit, or lychee slush. This place had all 3 flavours and DOZENS more. Most places I've visited only have a handful of flavours. 

I ended up ordering a large lychee slush bubble tea with tapioca. The cashier asked me something that I didn't quite hear so I responded with a friendly \"pardon?\", she got very rude as if I offended her by asking her to repeat herself and proceeded to yell what she had previously said. Did not appreciate her unnecessary attitude. 

Other than the impolite cashier, the lychee bubble tea was delicious. The tapioca balls tasted fresh. I payed about $7.50. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but I might consider giving this place another shot if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This time I ordered a large Milo milk tea with small tapioca. The drink offers very strong milk and Milo flavor, giving you bang for your buck. The store was close to pack this afternoon, with many customers sitting and a short line up to order. It was worth the wait to get my drink"}
{"text":"Despite the various responses for the quality of BBT, I think it'll always vary depending on what you get and with what sort of modifications. I can say for certain, the manager (my assumption) is pretty nice and accommodating.  Service is great!  I even remember a long time ago, I left my card behind here and the manager even ran out half way down to give it back to me. Quite memorable    #favbbt"}
{"text":"Went again and writing an updated about how i experience. 
* got the barley milk tea and oatmeal milk tea. They were really nice. The oatmeal is def my fav because it reminds me of asian oatmeal that i loved 
* service is incredible. Owner/manager ? Was really attentive and showed true warmth. 
* they offer shaved ice as well as noodle bowls. Will come back to try again
* compared to other nearby bubble tea shops, this place has spacious seatings with great natural light. 
* great variety of unique flavour mix drinks !"}
{"text":"This is based on my first drink I've had here. I'm not a person who usually would put red bean in their bbt but I wanted to try this drink out since it was part of their bestsellers. I asked for 50% sugar, I think the taste could have been stronger. It is not a bad combination though, it made the milk tea a bit frothy which was interesting. I will come back and try their other drinks!"}
{"text":"Came back for the Wednesday Special - Caramel Pudding Milk Tea. 

Since my last experience with their Monday Special that the milk tea was quite plain and not sweet enough, I ordered Extra Sweet today. I brought it home, added more ice, and it tasted like one of the best milk tea I've ever had. The caramel pudding is not completely pudding though, it's small pieces of pudding covered by jelly so it is basically called as Caramel Pudding Jelly. It is quite interesting. 

My suggestion is that if you're used to with the regular sweetness like other bubble tea chain, order Extra Sweet for milk tea. Then, it will taste even better than Chatime and Sharetea. 

I give 4 stars because I believe there is always room for improvement and I have only tried milk tea. I will come back regularly for the Monday and Wednesday Special for milk tea, maybe for other drinks as well, but it is quite pricey. I just love the service here. The owner is so nice and smiling all the time.

Again, I totally recommend!!!"}
{"text":"-- Good --
The bubble milk tea with pearls was delicious. I like this milk tea slightly more than Chatime because it has less of the creamy flavour that's a little too overpowering. 

It's unique that they offer bubble tea pearls in 2 sizes, you can get a mix of both if you like too. I tried both sizes, but my partner and I still prefer just the regular sized pearls. 

-- Bad --
Cash only unless it's above a certain amount. Slow service even at 7:30pm (busy-time), there was only one taking order and another making drinks. Service was average - girl didn't appear friendly and didn't smile. Slightly felt like an item being processed at a factory. But I do understand she must feel quite busy to accurately process and fulfill all the orders with short-staff. 

-- Summary --
Because the service is slow and the bubble tea is quite pricey. I still choose Chatime instead."}
{"text":"Bubble Republic is night and day compared to Chatime. In terms of ambiance, Bubble Republic is a lot quieter than its counterpart. The flavour of Bubble Republic's original milk tea is also far inferior. Price is higher. Texture of the tapioca lacks the resistances of tapioca from Chatime. 

Although they are in close proximity, I would opt for Chatime over Bubble Republic on any occasion."}
{"text":"I was greeted by a super friendly barista upon entering. It was my first time here so I asked him what the popular drinks were. He directed me to the two \"top choices\" boards, suggested the Panna Cotta Black Milk Tea, and even gave me a small sample! My drink came up to $6.20 which I considered a bit pricey but I guess that's the standard for bbt nowadays.

Seating is limited and the bathrooms could use some cleaning, but was impressed by the kindness of the barista and novelty of panna cotta bbt (actually have no idea if this is a unique flavor - I don't drink bbt often)."}
{"text":"Love their daily specials here - my favourite being the large mango chiller on Thursdays for $4.09+tax.  Carries all the same selection as their other locations. It would be great if they could bring all the food offerings they have in Mississauga because it's pretty authentic Taiwanese (which isn't an option in the area)."}
