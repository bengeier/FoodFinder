{"text":"We stumbled across this place right before noon and popped in because it was brightly lit and had a couple of pics of amazing looking banh mi and noodle dishes. Definitely did not disappoint - delicious soups and entres, friendly owners, bright and clean and simple. And the price was right."}
{"text":"This small and very new shop delighted us with a bahn mi and spring rolls on a ridiculously hot day.  Everything tasted good, the people working there were all friendly, and the interior was clean and new.  They'll be easier to find once they have a sign but don't wait, the restaurant was crowded and people are discovering them!"}
{"text":"I love it!!!!!!My favorite sandwich in the world! I always take la sandwich Banh mi au poulet effiloché avec une petite soupe saté que je trempe dedans. C trop bon."}
