{"text":"Great pho, great service. They even split a bowl for my children. Wish there were a few more food options, but this is a mall food court. Please frequent them so that we can keep good pho nearby.   Maybe the beginning of a foodie food court at PV?"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and decided to check this place out and was impressed. The owners are super friendly and the food was great! Finally found a half way decent  Vietnamese restaurant in this area. Very happy and highly recommended"}
{"text":"Color me pleasantly surprised! Good, cheap Pho at the PV Mall Food Court. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Fabulous Pho for a great price!  I got hooked on this kind of food many years ago and their broth and ingredients are excellent.  I would have never thought that I could find this good soup in a food court, but their Pho Beef was excellent.  I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but I couldn't help it... This place is great! The pho is super tasty and fresh. I can't believe it's in a mall food court. I wish fashion square had one"}
{"text":"Just tried the Chicken Pho...wow this is some good stuff!! And only $5 too!! Also ordered the veggie fried rice and that was excellent as well. Very nice folks behind the counter. I informed them I was vegetarian so I went without the chicken and the owner was very nice to offer me extra veggies. Will definitely be coming here a lot! Oh, and polished it all off with a taro boba tea. So yummy!  Post Vegetarian Update: the vegg experiment is over and now I'm able to order any item off VVF's menu. This has become my favorite place, not just for Vietnamese food, but as a regular go-to place. Everything I've tried has been terrific, but I do have a fave that the owner custom makes for me which is the #1 grilled chicken w grilled veggies (instead of a salad) and he puts a fried egg on top, aka \"Chris' Special\"."}
{"text":"I stumbled here on accident while walking through the mall. The restaurant is owner is passionate about his trade and uses only quality products in his pho. The broth is made with Beef bones giving it a rich marrow taste, unlike a lot of Pho places that take shortcuts with their broth to serve the masses. The pho tai even has thinly sliced filet mignon instead of the standard inexpensive beef cuts. There is no competing with this pho-- it is in a class of its own! Hidden gem in a very unexpected place in the Valley."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to have Pho soup and from the reviews on Yelp decided to try this place. We were a little scared seeing that it is a food court place but it was delicious! The staff was polite, very pleasant and helpful with making our order just as we wanted them. I had the chicken Pho soup without the meat (I'm not a fan of meat textures), they added vegetable for me and it was very good. My husband had the beef pho and the meat was very tender and had great flavor.   They serve there soup in actual bowls so you don't get the Styrofoam taste to your soup which was a concern before I saw the real bowl.   I would highly recommend trying this place for yourself."}
{"text":"This is a mom-and-pop place that just happens to be in a mall food court.Food is super fast as you would expect. Of course there are less selectionscompared to a restaurant. Prices seem very good, great for Paradise Valley."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food and have at least once per month. Yet I hardly find a good and decent price one in North Phoenix area, I usually go to Da Vang more than a decade. Until today, my Vietnamese girlfriend wanted to try some pho in my area. I bring her to this new place in PV mall. Like others mentioned, the owner set the price is very comparable and low price than its neighbor food court competitors like Panda Express or Osaka. She loves the meatball pho, the soup is very tasty and warm. She even said the soup is very similar than her home made one. I order the daily special pork chop with salad/eggroll #1 combo. The eggroll is very crispy and I saw the chef deep fry when I ordered. The taste is great and better many Chinese restaurants I went. I can taste some soysauce and meat in it. I think it is homemade, not the one from Costco or supermarket nation brand one.  The pork chop is huge almost covers half of the box, soft and juicy, with a bone. I also like its side salad. They use the Japanese ginger lime juice dressing. I also have a small bowl of chicken soup. I enjoy that place a lot, especially close to home and it is not expensive than Viet Kitchen Restaurant locate at Cave Creek Road."}
{"text":"This small stand is inside the Paradise Valley Mall food court.  Keep in mind that when I looked for  the restaurant in the Paradise Valley Mall Directories, it was not listed.  So don't leave the place just because you don't see it.  Hopefully, the owners will do something about this.  Ordered the meatball/beef pho and another chicken pho but without noodles.  Both Pho's had powerful, delicious broths and generous portions of everything.  Lots of meatballs in mine which I totally enjoyed considering that I had a bad cold and this hot delicious broth awakened my body again.  The owner is so affable and attentive.  He came out to see how our pho's were and offered to give the person who chose no noodles additional chicken and veggies.  Lovely gesture.   This is the place to go if you want a magnificent pho is the Phoenix area without having to venture out into the Avenues.  Oh, and i almost forgot.  $5.95 for PHO?  Absolutely fantastic price."}
{"text":"Even though it's at a mall food court, they still serve the noodles in usual plastic bowls! We started with Spring Rolls - they were pretty good, but it really needed the fresh flavor of the mint.  The #5 Beef & Meatball Noodle Soup had ample noodles, but the flavor in the broth was just not there.  The broth needs to stew long enough to develop the flavors - maybe the traffic at the mall isn't enough to have big pots of broth stewing for the whole day... #8 Bun Thit Nuong - Grilled Pork over Noodles had huge portions of pork but didn't have the distict seasoning on the pork nor the Nuoc Cham.  The staff are super nice and compared to the other reviews, we hope we caught them on an \"off day\"."}
{"text":"Pretty ballsy for anyone to take up McDonald's old space in the PV food court, let alone a family run Vietnamese joint! A lot of my friends back home would laugh if I said the best Viet food I had this week came from a 10 year old, his dad, and a white dude but I am far from joking.  My bro and I ordered separately, but I got grilled chicken over rice. That must have been two or three thighs or something because I got a box full of juicy, well seasoned meat over light rice. The salad that came with it felt more Americanized with the dressing but it still worked well. My bro ordered pho as always, and before he finished wiping out the bowl I tried the broth, which is pretty solid. Also super cool that you get actual restaurant style bowls in the court.  We did hit a little snafu - I ordered the spring rolls which seemed like they took forever. The lady at the adjacent table and I were talking about how adorbs the kid at the register was when she picked up her order of 6 - which came with a bonus since they ran out of shrimp. Strange, I came up to the bro working in the kitchen in asked him what's up. Man, that fallout between him and the little guy when they saw my order was incomplete was hilarious and totally worth it. But they DID hook me up with some more expensive slushie of any choice with boba. I got pina colada - which was a mighty fine drink.  Maybe it's the lack of traffic/help is from Thanksgiving weekend, because drinks and food did take a bit when they made everything fresh to order. However, my experience was more than satisfying and I am surely trying more of their menu next time I'm shopping around PV."}
{"text":"Vietnamese food in a mall food court? I have never before seen that in an American mall. That is what pulled me in & made me want to try it - especially with the high reviews.  I went for the Pho Tai Bo Vien (Rare Steak & Meatballs). It was brought out & served to me in a real bowl along with everything you need. They brought out veggies, Sriracha, Hoison sauce, chop sticks, & a soup spoon!   The pho was not perfect, but I have high expectations as I eat it homemade all the time. It was good enough and especially for the price & convenience. I would certainly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just opened up! It is located within the PV mall food court! Really good pho for 5 bucks! No joke! Various types of boba flavors to pick from! Other yummy items on the menu! Will be back!! Check it out!  Been here 7 times now and I still love it. They even have Vietnamese iced coffee."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food and great customer service. The pho is on point, the vermicelli as well. I am standing in the PV mall food court (a terrible place to be at the end of a long work day) when I want to be on my couch just to eat this food. And it's so worth it."}
{"text":"After taking the kids to a movie, we headed to the Paradise Valley Mall food court. I did not expect flavorful Pho with perfectly cooked veggies and tasty, fresh noodles. A hearty treat after a long morning run!! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good news for the area just north of Paradise Valley - you now have a Vietnamese eatery, and a good one at that!  I love Vietnamese food and have tried a lot of the Vietnamese eateries in the metro area (http://www.yelp.com/list/vietnamese-restaurants-phoenix). I didn't have very high expectations when I saw this in a food court (in the Paradise Valley Mall) but happily, it turned out to be a really good food experience. It definitely looks like a mom-n-pop operation and the couple who attended to me were very friendly. I ordered one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes: bún thit nuong (rice noodles with grilled meat) but could not decide on pork or chicken, so the gentleman from the kitchen suggested a half-and-half topping (half chicken, half pork) and I accepted. The food was served in a real bowl, just like in a regular Vietnamese restaurant, and I have to say that it was the best bún thit nuong I've ever had! I also ordered a mango smoothie - it was refreshing, creamy and sweet ... and made a dessert course unnecessary ;) On the next visit I ordered pho ga, and on a third visit I had a special for the day: lemongrass chicken; both dishes were very good. As is expected for Vietnamese fare, the food here is inexpensive, costing even a bit less than in most Vietnamese restaurants in the metro area."}
{"text":"I have had their food twice after I discovered them in the PV mall. I moved from California to Phoenix needless to say that I have high standards when comes to Vietnamese food. I have to say that they did not disappoint.   I tried the Pho and grilled pork dish both were authentic delicious!   Do give them a try!"}
{"text":"This mall Vietnamese place was excellent and the owner indeed had a passion for his food. The gossip obtained from the restaurants close to where they were, is that their lease was up and they decided not to renew. No word as to whether or not they are moving to another location, but we certainly hope so."}
{"text":"PLEASE come & support this place!!! I want great Vietnamese food near my house always & I would rather come here than other place even a sit down restaurant. This is the real deal you will be blown away by its authenticity. Owners are kind, professional & will explain the dishes perfectly !"}
{"text":"This is in the PV Mall Food Court, I think it may be the spot where McDonald's used to be.  Yaay! finally found a decent place nearby for my pho fix. They serve pho in a real bowl (not disposable) which was nice, they do not have my favorite (dac biet) but what they had was good. Service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Very good pho in the mall food court of all places! I count this as one of my faves for pho. I had the rare filet and it was delicious. The beef was good quality and the trimmings were fresh and cold. The price is also good and the staff (maybe the owner) are very friendly and accommodating!"}
{"text":"Best mall food evahhhhh. Great pho served by kind people who are obviously passionate about cooking. Yes!!"}
{"text":"I'm new to Phoenix area and have been trying to find a good Vietnamese food place for those times that I don't have time to cook but don't feel like pizza or burgers. I grew up with Vietnamese food and have tasted different family recipes so I do know what it should taste like if anyone wants an honest opinion. So I was pleasantly surprised by this place in the mall. The food was good and price was reasonable. Major indications of a good Vietnamese restaurant for me is always the egg rolls and Pho soup. The egg rolls have a decent filling that is not just all cabbage and noodles as fillers. The beef Pho noodle soup was also tasty. I will have to try the chicken Pho noodle soup next time to see if it gets 5 stars. (Just FYI: Chicken Pho should have a chicken stock broth that's a little more clear and tastes a little different than the beef broth. The chicken meat in the soup shouldn't be tough and dry even if it is the white part.) Definitely go here if you want decent Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Good pho, great prices, awesome service. Got a chicken pho (huge), chicken fried rice (huge) and an egg roll  to go. So yummy and more than enough for 2 people"}
{"text":"Oh fellow yelpers....how you have led me wrong this time. I know, you're thinking, it's a food court, what was I thinking.  We decided to give it a try based on the five star reviews. What a terrible idea. We had an egg roll, a skewer of barbecue pork, and a noodle bowl with chicken. All barely edible. The egg roll was greasy. The skewer of pork was burnt, and the chicken in the noodle bowl was spongy.   We literally ate a few bites and no more. (And we're usually members of the clean plate club).  I actually said out loud, that if we didn't get sick from dinner, it'd be a miracle."}
{"text":"Ok. So this use to be a horrible Korean mall restaurant. But now it's a delicious Vietnamese food you will not expect from a food court.  The people who own it are super sweet.   Everybody should eat here pho sure."}
{"text":"Who woulda thought that I would find a pretty solid bowl of Pho in the Paradise Valley Mall food court? This obviously family owned and ran establishment is definitely worth checking out if your looking for some different food court fare... The broth was flavorful, my meatballs were delicious and service was spot on!"}
{"text":"I was attracted to the good reviews from Yelp and seemingly good price.  However, it was dark and no one was there.  It may be closed for good?"}
{"text":"Please don't shortchange this place because it is not a chain restaurant in a mall food court. I think people feel obligated to go to \"what they know\" in food courts, but this place is really worth it. Delicious pho for a happy price. Next time I go back, I'll also try the spring rolls because they looked so fresh and refreshing. I love that it is also close to my house, so I can come here anytime I am craving Vietnamese food, and not just when I'm at the mall."}
{"text":"I had very low expectations from a mall food court Pho shop. Boy was I wrong! I judge all Pho on the broth and this broth is excellent. Better than many sit-down restaurants I have frequented in the past. Another outstanding feature of the Pho Tai is the beef. It is real, thickly cut and tasty. Many shops have paper thin slices but not here. (see photo) This is a mom and pop shop that reminds me of my time in Saigon. Do yourself a favor and give them a try. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Location: This place is located at the food court in Paradise Valley Mall next to Mucha Lucha Taco Shop. The business hours coincide with the mall hours.   Food: I must say the Vietnamese food here is relatively inexpensive compared to other West Valley places. The bun thit nuong (grilled pork with vermicelli) was only $6. A bowl of pho was roughly $5-6. That's a great deal! Born and raised in Cali, my standards for Vietnamese food are very high. The food stayed true to the authentic Vietnamese taste, but ran on the mediocre side. I had the #8 bun thit nuong, and was not impressed. I'm used to the traditional cucumbers, bean sprouts, and mints that were all lacking in this dish. This is not an accurate representation of all the flavors that I would normally expect. My boyfriend had the special of the day, lemon grass chicken with egg. The dish wasn't too salty and had the right amount of flavors. It felt like something we could easily cook at home. Overall, this place is great for mall food, but not restaurant quality. I still need to try their pho though.     Service: They were fast at delivering out the orders. The cashier was awesome about finding and bringing the food directly to the customers sitting around the food court."}
{"text":"I've seen the reviews for VVF but really didn't have a desire to visit. Not a big fan of Mall Food Courts and not a really big fan of Pho. So this place was not on the top of my list. My wife wanted some Pho and do some shopping and PV Mall. She mentioned the Pho place I mentioned to her. So Valley Vietnamese Food was it.   This is a mom and pop shop in the mall. Not to often you find this in the food court. So I ordered the Spring Rolls and I got to tell you. It was bigger than all the other places I got spring rolls. Longer. Had fresh shrimp and beef inside. Very fresh. Didn't seem like it was pre-made. The peanut sauce was really good. My wife and I really loved it. It was so good.   I ordered the Pho Tai Bo Vien which basically had Meatballs and beef. It was really good. Fresh veggies. Fresh beef. Tender beef and the meatballs. So good. Me and my wife tried to figure out what kind of meat were in the Meatballs but couldn't figure it out. I tell you what. It was probably one of the best Pho I had. Really good. Gobbled it all up and it's a huge bowl. It's an actual bowl and they give you a real soup spoon too. All you have to do is bring the bowls and spoons back to the counter.   My wife got the Pho Meatballs. She really liked it too. It was way too much for her so she brought the rest home and ate it later that night. No complaints from her.   After I order the food, I was expecting them to yell my name and slide the food on the food counter. Not here. I was looking down at my phone and the mother of the owner hand delivered the tray to me. Very nice touch. Really appreciated this.   So this is no ordinary food court place. Great food. Cheap food. Huge portions. We ordered two Pho and spring rolls for $17. What a deal. Very nice service. So I feel even through this is in a food court, I had a really good dinner.   I even talked to the owner and asked him why he started this business in a food court cause mom and pop shops never start in food courts. Anyways, he said that this is his first restaurant and didn't know where to go so he went here. I love mom and pop shops.   This guys really good. Loved it and will definitely be back. I encourage all you Yelpers to give this place a try and show some Yelp luv here. It's really worth it."}
{"text":"I'm scoring in regards of context- this is a food court and obviously won't be the best thing you've ever come across. That being said, pho in a food court is awesome. Broth is on the sweeter side, and it looks like the noodles are really rice noodles and not wheat. The man to take my order was very kind and even offered my a glass of water when he didn't see me order a drink (I thought it was a sweet gesture). He brought the soup to my table with  the usual lime, sprouts and basil, also with Sriracha and hoisen. I wouldn't make a trip for it, but I would definitely go for this over anything else in that area (outer restaurants included)."}
{"text":"Best pho and spring rolls I've found in Arizona! So inexpensive too, 3.50 for two massive spring rolls! Everything is half the price, and double the size of any other Vietnamese restaurant. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is the best food I've ever gotten from a mall food court. Everything about it was spectacular! The service was extremely fast, the food was delicious and the price was exceptionally cheap. It's legitimate restaurant quality food at food court prices and speed. I don't know how they pull it off but I'll do my best to keep them in business.   The beef and meatball pho was calling my name and I was not disappointed with the selection. The bowl was an excellent size with plenty of noodles and meat. Needless to say I left very satisfied.   The value here is just incredible. You will be hard pressed to find a better combination of food, price and service."}
{"text":"A fantastic find for fans of food courts and Pho. I repeat. A fantastic find for fans of food courts and Pho. A fantastic find for fans of food courts and Pho. A fantastic find for fans of food courts and Pho.  Tasty, restaurant quality Pho in a mall food court! Such a pleasant surprise. Moderately priced. Friendly service. Served, not in food court Styrofoam, but in actual bowls. A bowl seems like a small thing, but it makes such a difference when it comes to Pho. Valley Vietnamese Food is a huge step up from the Korean joint that had occupied this same spot. Also seems to be a local family owned business.  The PV Mall food court has really improved of late. Much better options. The court is becoming a destination in and of itself for our family. Perfect if your gang has conflicting cravings. Enough variety for any family. Everyone can get what they want. And don't forget the Coca Cola Carousel for the kids. Situated at the North side of the mall, the food court is most easily accessed by parking in the mall parking garage."}
{"text":"I lunched on the Grilled Chicken Combo plate. Tons of food!  Grilled thighs with rice and fried potstickers with a generous side salad. The food was delicious and such a nice surprise in a low profile mall. The owner was kind and accommodating."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! By far the best pho and Vietnamese food I have had in Phoenix. Don't let the mall location dissuade you. Real deal slow cooked billions of bones lip smackingly delicious pho. The pork vermicelli is also excellent. Highly reccomended. Go, now...... what are you waiting for?  Go... the savory goodness of Vietnam await.  I said go!"}
{"text":"Out here in Scottsdale for a 4 week training. Was craving Pho and saw this 5 star rating on Yelp. I agree with the others that reviewed this place, the  pho was great and was not disappointed. I'm from an area in SoCal that is big on pho and the taste you get from this place isn't far from what I'm used to. Their fried rice ain't that bad either for $3.25. So kudos! will be going back before I leave"}
{"text":"Inside Paradise Valley Mall food court where McDonald's once was.  Ordered the #6 Pho Beef and Meatball and Pork Chop with Salad and Fried Egg  Service is a little mixed up where they gave people the wrong order and then had to scramble to get it right. Tip - Find a table and then wait for your food until they bring it to the counter .   The Beef and Meatball Pho was pretty good and it came with bean sprouts and chili, very generous portion for $6.75 and came out the right temperature,  not too hot and not to cold.  The Pork Chop with Salad and Fried Egg was also a generous amount of food and the way the pork chopped was grilled was very tasty.  Regardless of being in a mall food court or not, the food was very good especially with its low price.   I look forward to the next visit to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I am eating their #9 right now and it is fantastic, especially for food at the mall. Better than any of the other fast food places here. Take a risk and give it a try. Glad I did!"}
