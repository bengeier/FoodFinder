{"text":"This is a solid HK style cafe. Came for the afternoon snack and ordered the French toast, one with peanut butter and one w/out (originally we ordered 2 with peanut butter, but the waitress suggested we try one with and one without) great recommendation as it is made differently and tasted different too. The one without peanut butter was my favorite as it had a unique taste to it. Came back the next morning for their breakfast speacials which are a great deal. You get your choice of eggs and ham with toast, a drink, and a noodle soup. All that food for under 6 bucks. Their milk tea was solid, had good tea flavor and was not watered down. Would come back to try their baked rice dishes the next time I come back to TO."}
{"text":"We find ourselves coming back frequently as there is usually no wait, and the food is consistent with large portions. Prices are very reasonable. We especially love the cube french toast here and order it everytime! It's crispy on the outside and soft (melts in your mouth) on the inside.  Highly recommended! The HK milk tea here is also pretty well done compared to similar establishments in the area. This time, we came for dinner and ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce and cheese, and the baked pork chop with tomato on rice. Both were great. There is plenty of parking in the plaza, and service quick. We definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"????????????????????????? ???????? ????$8 / $9???????????????????????? ??????????????????????..."}
{"text":"They're the same owners as Matsuda (a few stores down). But PSA: there are better Chinese breakfast places out there.   Very typical Chinese fare. I find their food quite bland and service slow during the lunch rush but prices are reasonable for the portion. I would rather go elsewhere, like the old T&T food court for rice rolls."}
{"text":"Solid HK Cafe that does sizzling plate meals! It's a very nostalgic feeling since this used to be the norm but recently HK cafes have moved away from them because they are heavy and hard to clean up. But the experience of hearing the sizzling and holding your napkin in front of you as the sauce hits the plate and you hear a rush of sound and get that hit of garlic or black pepper sauce is fun!   Bonus: they have some of the best cream soup and HK borsche with their meals I've had in recent memory :)"}
{"text":"This is a Hong Kong style cafe. Same owners as the Matsuda all you can eat sushi which is a few stores down.They have afternoon from 2:30-5:30pm. Servers are really friendly. Food is on the higher end of the spectrum in terms of taste. Their chicken teriyaki rice was delicious because the chicken was made really well with a crispy skin. Lacked in terms of the amount of sauce in comparison to the amount of rice. Would definitely come here again and try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I've now been to Pine House Cafe twice, and came away feeling pretty good both times. It's your standard Hong Kong style cafe, where you can get rice plates, fried noodles, fried rice, and a cup of tea with your meal. The seating is comfortable and the staff are friendly.   Both times I went, I got a similar meals (rice with pork chops or chicken, and a sauce). Fairly standard, both dishes were tasty and the portion size was good. The tea isn't amazing, but it's not bad.   The price is again, standard with other comparable cafes. I believe both my rice dishes were $9, and came with a cup of tea (can't remember if it comes with soup as well). Certainly no complaints, and I think Pine House is a great addition to an area that's been quiet since T&T left (there's a new grocery store there now)."}
{"text":"Very bad service. I ordered a steak and after tax is 29 something. Then they said they don't have machine to use card. I have 30 cash and give them, the owner said no money don't eat... very bad service not recommended at all."}
{"text":"This is the only place I've ever been to that takes an hour and a half to make fried chicken. Are you kidding me? If you're slow as shit, let me know. Don't tell me it's cooked from scratch when it's still not done after waiting for an hour and a half."}
{"text":"Having opened about 3 months ago, this is another good ol' HK-style afternoon tea restaurant. As always, afternoon tea prices are the cheapest ($5-7) but lunch prices are still great ($8-10ish). The combo allows you to choose a main dish along with a soup and a drink. THE BORSCHT SOUP IS SO DELICIOUS. It's the richest and most flavourful one I've had yet and it even has nice small shredded pieces of braised beef in it!   Update: I've been here multiple times now having tried many dishes and on an overall, everything here was great! Large portions for yummy food at a fair price. Definitely one of my family's new go-to's."}
{"text":"This is your typical HK style restaurant. With your meal you get a choice of cream style or Russian soup, and a hot/ cold beverage.  Today I ordered the eel fried rice (omit the green peas). Not bad. Big chucks of fried eel were obviously present. (Please refer to pics below). I didn't really like the Bonito flakes on top and would have preferred masago or tobiko. But then again, this isn't a Japanese restaurant. Portion was huge and packed half to go. Another good find!"}
{"text":"It must be the nostalgic 80s and 90s Chinese music/MTV they play in the background that keeps me coming back again and again ....  Or it may be because whenever I lunch here, i find a little bit of serenity and solitude amidst my busy day, amidst this busy neighborhood, even amidst this plaza. This is Pine House Oasis.   Even at its peak lunch hours, I never felt I was being rushed to leave.   Lunch combos start at $8. Comes with soup and drink.   The service is great! Servers are friendly, attentive and polite. (A rarity for a Chinese restaurant). The food is tasty. It comes out fast and it comes out big! I like the sizzling plate with veggies, so climatic! And it's enough for 3 meals! The HK milk tea, although not award winning, is quite solid. You really can't ask for too much more from a HK cafe.   My favorite place to be midweek is their little booth in the back...an hour of Calmness before heading out and facing what the day has in store for me...."}
{"text":"Pine House Cafe is located in the Matsuda plaza on Steeles and Middlefield! Located right next to the grocery store, parking is perfect for this plaza - you usually don't need to wait more than 5 minutes for a parking spot.   The letters and colour of Pine House Cafe is really similar to Matsuda so we guessed they were owned by the same owners - later confirmed that they are owned by the same people because people wearing Matsuda shirts came over and dropped off some milk in the kitchen!  For a Chinese fast food type cuisine, Pine House Cafe's prices are reasonable, though the time for food to come out was a little longer - possibly because they are still a new restaurant. We ordered the beef ho fun and the Portuguese sauce baked rice.   The beef ho fun was slightly oily and in my opinion not saucey enough. The Portuguese sauce baked rice was rather tasty - though the portion appeared smaller than other dishes such as the fried rice, I think it was worth it. All this came with a drink as well as soup.  I will be coming back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Went back to check out their Curry and their French toast. The place was packed when I got there (2:10pm, Sunday). I ordered the Curry Beef Brisket. It is not the normal kind of beef brisket you get like the rest of the HK style restaurants, which sometimes is rough. Theirs are in small chucks, chewy and soft. (the person at the table beside us ordered the Beef brisket with noodle soup....and he got the same kind of brisket too).  The curry tasted differently from last time. Because this time their chef sprinkled some Lemon grass into it. Totally changed the taste, I prefer it plain like last time. Anyway, still good. The other dish we got was the Fried Pork Jowl. The sauce tasted like teriyaki. While the meat was sliced thin. Lean, yet very moist.  The French toast is something to die for. Cutting it into smaller chunks makes more crispy surface area. While the inside is super soft and chewy. And they use condensed milk other than sugar syrup. Just awesome."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times and each time I've had a pretty good experience. Staff are friendly but sometimes seem too busy chatting with each other... The menus are crumpled paper riddled with spelling words and such but atleast there's English and Chinese.  Tons of specials which is typical for hk cafe style restaurants. Comes with cream or borscht soup. I usually have the latter, but I find it extremely salty so beware!!  I had the baked pork with rice and the baked spaghetti with cheese and tomatoes sauce. Flavors are great but the pasta was swimming in oil which was a bit concerning. Over all not bad though and the food is not quite as over salted as the soup was.  Nice fast service and decent food :) don't go if you're in a hurry though because the speed of food does seem a bit inconsistent."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and not a time has disappointed me.  Their lunch set comes with soup and tea; borscht is rich and  flavorful.  My fave is their baked pork chop with tomato sauce on rice!  Great food, clean place but slow service."}
{"text":"Portions are large. Tried a few dishes and all were pretty good. The one that stands out is the cube french toast. Crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. Service was good. Never had to wait to get service."}
{"text":"Typical Hong Kong style breakfast lunch brunch afternoon tea restaurant.  On a Saturday they are quite busy. Waited around 15 mins for a seat. They have free wifi but signal is very weak almost non existence.  They have an afternoon special starting at 2:30-5:30? Pretty good deals. They all come with drinks, if you want a cold drink add $1.00.  For a party of 3 we ordered only 2 dishes and it was plenty for us. For lunch the price for the rice dishes are around $9.00 with drink and soup.  The noodle was $8.00 with drink and soup also. The service the drink before the meal which is okay to me. But normally they serve it after the meal. My table was missing sugar but the waitress notice and brought it to us after we borrowed from the table next to us.  Don't expect much service or them to speak much eng. it is a typical Chinese restaurant. But it's heap fast and good."}
{"text":"3.5 star. Newly opened HK style restaurant in this area that's great for a quick bite and good for Asian style comfort food. Prices are 5-15$/person on a average with food and drinks included depending on what time you go in. The portion sizes are also very generous. They do have a breakfast menu that's from 7:30-11:30am and afternoon tea menu from 2:30-5:30pm. Food is usually cheaper during those times. The place itself is very bright and not too loud.   What I ordered: Beef rice noodle stir fry $8: it was very well done! One of the best ones I've had in a very long time. This dish tends to be quite oily so the noodles won't stick to the wok when it's cooked, but it wasn't very oily when I had this one. Seasoning and everything balanced out. The beef portion was quite generous as well. This came with soup of the day and a choice of tea or coffee as well.  Club house sandwich $4.50: this is a well known sandwich every single Hong Kong style cafe would have. They substituted the bacon with some turkey ham to make it a healthier option. It was pretty good except it lacked a sauce. You just came have a sandwich without the sauce. Even if it's just plain mayo would be fine!   Overall I think this place is definitely a go to if you're sick of dim sum or have a hangover. The ratings would definitely change overtime once I've tried more of there items on the menu."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch. It was quite busy, though we quickly got a table. There were only two waitresses for a full house. The decor was alright; nothing special. I got the Baked rice with Portuguese sauce with brisket. It was definitely a heavy dish; it was my first meal of the day, and I barely finished it. Taste-wise, it wasn't a thing special, though it wasn't bad either. Overall, I'd rate my experience a 3/5."}
{"text":"Pros: Food is well done Friendly service  Cons: Menu is very limited  I used to frequent this place when it was called Elite cafe.  I really liked it then so I wondered how Pine House would compare.    Walking in, they pretty much kept the same decor as the previous business with a few minor tweaks.  There are still plenty of seats for the size of this place which is nice.  There are tables that will easily fit groups of 8 so big groups can certainly find a table without too much trouble.  When you sit down, they hand you the menu.  My first thought was is that it??  It was basically a small half sheet of paper with items on both sides.  It was a nicely done menu, but so very tiny.  I think there were no more than 30 items.  Comparing that to the extensive menu the previous business had, it was kinda disappointing.    I ordered a fired rice noodle and my wife ordered a baked rice dish.  The dishes are prepared very well here.  There's a good amount of food portion wise.  My fried rice noodle included a very good portion of beef and my wife's dish had a good portion of fish and cheese.  Taste wise, it was pretty good as well.   The staff here were all very nice. I really enjoyed the service of the last business here and it looks like Pine House Cafe has at least kept up with that tradition.    All in all, Pine House Cafe is a pretty good HK style cafe.  It could do with a bit more variety in the menu if you ask me though."}
{"text":"Pine House serves up some monstrous portions for breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea! There is no shortage of meat. I came here for afternoon tea and ordered the fried fish sandwich. The fish cutlet was bigger than my face and very thick. It is fried and battered but there was never any surprise batter chunks - every bite was fish! The milk tea here is also very aromatic and tasty. I came back for breakfast soon after. The combo is a super good deal. You get to pick an option under three different categories. The first is essentially a choice of meat (accompanied by eggs and toast) and the second and third choices build a meat + macaroni or noodle soup bowl. It's a ton of food and really yummy. The prices are just amazing. It's truly a $ place after tax and tip."}
{"text":"So, I was wandering after my exam on Monday at like 10AM.  Nobody was up and restaurants were only starting to open.  I was going to go to the Viet Sub in the corner as I was looking for carbs but gave this place a shot.  Should've just went to my viet sub.  I walked in and got seated right away.  They gave me a tattered breakfast menu that was relatively cheap, approx $7.99 for a meal + drink.  I ordered the congee beef with fried noodle and a iced lemon tea.   The iced lemon tea got delivered with a Chinese newspaper.  Here is where things get a little droll.  I told my server that I didn't want the newspaper as I was reading a e-book on my iPhone.  She looked at me in surprised and straight up asked me, \"you don't know how to read Chinese?!\" I confirmed negative.  She walked back to the cash and you can hear her say to another server, \"the (leng mui) little girl doesn't know how to read!\" Server 2 response: Really? Does she speak Chinese? Original Server: Yes she does, but she can't read Server 2: Did she stutter like go \"um\" or \"eh\" when she talked to you? Original: No, she spoke ok but she doesn't know how to read at all  & here I am, awkward as hell sitting literally a metre away from them?!?!?!?!?!?  It was funny afterwards but I got a little embarrassed as the other patrons took a peek at me.    OK, I digress.   The food came out fairly quick, roughly 5-7 minutes.  The congee was a little watery and the beef was obviously frozen and only dethawed as my congee boiled.  I didn't finish the congee.  The fried noodles were very standard and had a good load of bean sprouts fried in.  It wasn't bad but just a little too oily.  My iced lemon tea wasn't steeped long enough ): so I was literally drinking lemon water with honey.    My bill came to $8 something.    Overall, I'd rather trek a little farther and go to New City by Kennedy and Hwy 7."}
{"text":"After being here for Afternoon Tea and Dinner for a few times, I have to update my review of Pine House Cafe.  The food is good in general and the service always excellent. The main problem though is the food lack consistency. It have been opened for almost 2 months and what I ordered can be a hit or miss even on the same item!  Even their Borscht soup can be rich and with chucks of vegetables and beef on a good day and a week later tasted watery and blend. Same with the sauce on their Baked Pork Chop and Rice.  I hope the kitchen can have their standard sorted out. It might be the most important factor to keep your existing customer keep returning."}
{"text":"Decided to try this new HK style diner since it was close by. The sign out front is huge and it would be pretty hard to miss the purple. The decor inside is simple and clean. The menu, typical Chinese diner food nothing special and distinguishing. Ordered the HK diner default items that are available at most places.  Two options for soups that come with the meal: Russian borscht and cream soup. Since cream soup isn't at every diner had to choose it. It was creamy and flavourful, definitely a good start to the meal. Sadly when the egg sandwich came it was disappointing visually. The bread was extremely thin and after the first bite, it was confirmed that the bread wasn't that freshest. The egg was the right consistency and level of cooked, just a bit under seasoned but that could be fixed with a dash of salt and pepper. Everything else was average, it was good but doesn't stand out.  Overall, it's a decent HK style diner so the parents will probably want to come back again for lunch."}
