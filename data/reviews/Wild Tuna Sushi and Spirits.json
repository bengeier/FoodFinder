{"text":"I've been to most of the top rated and well known sushi spots in the greater Phoenix area and I have to say Wild Tunas is by far my favorite. Small family run place with the best Yellow tail and Tuna in town. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent saki bombers. I hear they have exellent sushi. Will have to check that out another day."}
{"text":"I have read a few other reviews that say this place is a mom and pop place.  Let me clarify- Pop actually makes the sushi and his son is the very friendly waiter.  They were both very professional and checked to make sure we like all of our food.  Knowing that we are supporting a local business and their food was really good, we have found our new sushi place!  One other clarification from other reviews- a few people have talked about a cafeteria-like atmosphere and bright lights.  I am very sensitive to lights and was not bothered by theirs at all.  The decor is pleasant with dark walls and simple tables and chairs.  I thought it all looked pretty familiar and then when I looked at the bottom of their soy sauce bowls, it hit me.  The decor and dishes are all CB2 or very similar.  CB2 is the college or just starting your career level of Crate and Barrel.  Simple, clean, slightly trendy, and overall comfortable.  As for the food (which is the whole reason for going, right?), my husband and I loved or really liked all of the sushi.  We tried four different dishes since the waiter was kind enough to inform us as we walked in that we still had ten minutes if happy hour left.  Happy hour from 5-6 on a Saturday night?  Nice!  I always have to have yellow tail when I have sushi and theirs was yummy.  Then we tried some less conventional sushi. The surf and turf was very good but I don't eat much steak anymore.  The sauce they use on it was really yummy tho.  My husband loved the dynamite rolls.  I thought it was good, but did not like the taste or consistency of the sauce the scallops were in when it was eaten with the roll.  My favorite of the unconventional rolls was the captain crunch.  Altho I am not usually a fan of tempura or eel sauce, the combination of the crunchiness of the tempura flakes on top of the roll and the sweetness of the eel sauce made this a nice sushi dish to end the meal on.  The amount of eel sauce was just perfect.  By the way, if you ask about their beers, don't get turned off if the waiter says bud light first.  They have some good Japanese beers (Kirin light, Kirin ichiban, Sapporo).  We suggested he not say the bud first so we will see if he changes. The house sake was typical compared to other sushi places.    Overall, nice place, great service and staff, yummy food, local and family-owned.  We found our new sushi place!"}
{"text":"I feel bad writing this place a bad review because the staff (and owners I expect) were very nice and the food was pretty good.  However, I wouldn't recommend this place because it was way overpriced. The rolls were about $1-$2 more than what I'd imagine for this kind of place. However, we also had the $14 Tuna Poke appetizer and it was tiny. I am used to the Poke at places like the Islands or Yard House where it's a whole plate for that price. This was maybe 1/4 plate.  If it weren't for the prices I would go back, but I can just as easily find decent strip mall sushi for much less."}
{"text":"Top notch sushi, top notch chef! Only reason for not giving them 5 stars is that they don't accept American Express.  If you're a sushi nut at all, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Awesome small sushi restaurant owned by the nicest family (father makes sushi, mother serves tables, and son helps serve and manage back of restaurant).  Fish is so fresh and they have a full bar.  My favorite rolls are spicy tuna and dynamite but all sushi pieces are excellent too.  Love supporting this small \"mom n, pop\" restaurant, as well."}
{"text":"We love love love wilds tunas! The food is fantastic and very fresh! Everything is made with special care. They have great customer service and are always friendly and welcoming!  The drinks here are awesome as well! Tyler is our favorite server! He always recognizes us and knows our order!  We highly recommend this place; alone or with a group it is great!"}
{"text":"Bubba Gump roll, California roll, and green tea ice cream is one of my favorite dinners. This is the best sushi."}
{"text":"A pleasantly unexpected surprise. After the first two times my husband dragged me here I was utterly unimpressed - poor service, mediocre (at best) food...so tonight was my first time back in about 5 months and I...liked it.  We had the shu mai (excellent!), rainbow roll, shrimp tempura roll and squid salad.  I'm an admitted fish snob and can't bring myself to eat sashimi at places that pre-slice the fish, but the rolls were downright tasty.  The tempura crisp and not greasy,  void of any fishy taste.  Service had also improved dramatically.  A grown-up was doing most of the serving, supported by a half-hearted teen.  This is a dramatic improvement over the previous entirely hopeless teen staff.  A really nice surprise!"}
{"text":"I received a gift certificate for Xmas . Finally got to use it . OMG  , I ordered the lunch sashimi special  ( tuna , salmon & hamachi)  fresh fish , beautiful color , and  appealing presentation . I don't  know why I waited so long . A little steep on prices , but still cheaper than Chicago .  Definitely a fantastic find in a strip mall ."}
{"text":"Local business with 5 Star service!  I had the pleasure of dining and visiting with Father & Son and had a fabulous experience!  Stop in - you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"We went here because there was such great reviews. The sushi was good and fresh. However, the prices were crazy for sashimi... they don't have any sashimi bowls or plates and it's $14.50 per sashimi order. So for us to get what we normally get at a sushi restaurant we would be well over $80 for the sashimi alone. Don't get me wrong, everything tasted fresh...just wouldn't go back because of the price."}
{"text":"Small, family-run sushi spot with an intimate dining area paired with great staff and amazing sushi! Very friendly and personable service. They make you feel very welcome, always. Rock n Roll roll is amazing and I would definitely recommend the spicy salmon or tuna as well. My boyfriend and I are definitely making this our go to place for a great dining experience. I would recommend them to anyone looking to find some tasty sushi provided by some friendly and talented people!"}
{"text":"Wild Tuna was unexpectedly really good. We had the hamachi neck, seaweed salad and Marilyn Monroll, and they were fresh and flavorful. The service was prompt, and the owners (I believe) were very accommodating and friendly.   Don't be fooled by its small size and strip mall location. The food is very good. I moved here from the SF Bay Area, and it's hard to find good, fresh sushi within Phoenix. I'll definitely be back, especially since it's quite close to my home."}
{"text":"Wild Tuna has the best sushi in the valley in my opinion.  The fish is always fresh and delicious, very high quality.  It is a small sushi bar owned by a super nice family.  The decor is modern and the color scheme of the place is fantastic.  My husband and I try to go 2-3 times a month because the sushi is just that good and the owners are just that awesome.  Our favorites is anything tuna because the tuna is always \"melt in your mouth\" quality.  I can't eat spicy tuna anywhere else. Their specialty rolls have fun names and are quite unique.  Everything we have tried there is delicious.  Wild Tuna is my favorite sushi bar, I have not found anything better in Arizona, in fact nothing comes close.  Always a wonderful experience and highly recommended if you are searching for superb sushi in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Absolutely pleased with this place. Very nice family owned restaurant. Clean, simple and inviting.   Killer menu! Authentic Japanese items and some others. Never have to wait long for food. Accommodating as I've ever seen! The woman even pulled out an extra chair for our baby carrier!   I love going to this place!!!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place one star because I couldn't figure out how to give half a star.  Now, I'm neither a sushi expert nor a snob when it comes to it but I know quality sushi when I taste it and this was not it. It was too bad because my friend and I were really excited to try this place out...especially since she lives across the street and we have been waiting for them to open their doors for a while.   I kind of got the feeling that this was going to be an interesting evening when we walked in and nobody really acknowledged our presence until I gave the chef the \"tell me if I should seat myself or wait for the waitress before I stab you with a chop stick\" look...right after that he gracefully mouthed the words \"just sit anywhere\". After waiting for 5-7 minutes the waitress finally came and brought us water and gave us some menus to look over. Normally on a Friday evening I would've understood the wait but the place only had like 10 people inside!   At this point I am really hoping that the sushi will make up for the crappy service. The menu had some unique rolls with some traditional rolls too. We wanted to try some of their own creations so we picked the Sqidinator, Bubba Gump roll, and the old favorite...the Philadelphia Roll.   So, at this time I'm feeling pretty good about our choices until they made us wait forever for our food. I think the remaining artic glaciers melted while we were waiting...ok so I'm exaggerating but that's how it felt!  When they finally brought out the sushi the Philly roll and the Squidinator were first. I went for the squid first and as soon as I bit down all I could taste was the mayo they put inside. It was so overpowering you couldn't even taste the squid. Obviously I was disappointed. Now, with the taste of mayo and fried squid in my mouth I reached for the Philly roll hoping the cream cheese inside would wash away the aftertaste of the roll. At least with this roll they didn't add too much of anything but the quality was definitely not there. I mean c'mon who messes up a Philly roll! They managed to make it taste like something I could buy at Safeway!   Now, all my hopes, dreams and future business were dependent on a roll named \"Bubba Gump\". Well just like the movie this roll should have been left to die in Vietnam! Again, they added to much mayo and some kind of hot sauce. They should have just gave me a bowl of mayo, hot sauce and rice...maybe that would have been cheaper because for these prices I should have gone to Stingray or Ra. Now, the worst part came at the end of the evening...no it was not the bill it was when the waitress asked if everything was good...and I answered \"everything was great! To this day I don't know what left more of a bitter taste in my mouth...the food or my lie.   This might have all been grand opening bugs they will work out but for the time being for quick sushi I am sticking to Sakana which is around the corner from my place."}
{"text":"This is where my husband and I like to go for date night. Their food quality is excellent and everyone working there is so friendly. I especially love their avocado, Philly, and spicy tuna rolls.  Prices are very reasonable. I love, love, love Wild Tuna! :)"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did since it is so close to home and a family-owned restaurant, but I had a very disappointing experience tonight.  I went with my father.  We ordered the yellowtail roll, the philly roll, and the surf and turf roll.  We liked the philly the best, but weren't impressed with the others.  The surf and turf was saturated in sauce and totally fell apart.  The portions were small for the price we thought.  Also, we were overcharged and the server didn't want to adjust our bill. I thought the decor was pretty cute, but I could have done without the big TV screen.   I won't be returning here in the future."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Went here on a whim for my girlfriends birthday and she and I both loved it. Not only was the sushi delicious, but the service is what makes me give a five star review. Run by a father and son, the service was great. Both are super down to earth, and you can tell they love what they do. Never too in your face with service and never neglectful which is VERY hard to find these days. Will definitely keep coming back for more.   Only suggestion I would make would be to have pictures of some of the specialty rolls, just so I know what exactly to expect. Not that I've been disappointed, mind you."}
{"text":"Another great restaurant in a strange strip-mall location. It must be a Phoenix thing I guess. If this place was located in a swanky part of town it would be the talk o the town. The sushi is the best I've had in town. Our group split 8 rolls and I enjoyed all of them. I really like the artwork and colorful theme too. The portions are smaller than some other places but the quality more than makes up for it. I will be back anytime I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place has great food and a friendly staff. It is reasonably priced and Yama Chan works at treating every customer like he or she is special."}
{"text":"Salad was great and dipping with sweetness.  Was very clean and sanitary.  Would come here again."}
{"text":"Small but very inviting place. Service was good and very nice. The Ell and cucumber was great and so was the squid salad."}
{"text":"What a delightful surprise! Clearly a family owned place that takes pride in what they make. To kick off the happy hour, we had the \"Strawberry Fields\" cocktail (and a Sopporo). The cocktail was made well, not too heavy on the alcohol, and the owner (who made the drink) kindly offered the over pour. We then tried the Captain Crunch roll, which had an excellent presentation and was delicious. We had intended only a quick appetizer but wanted to explore the menu since it was clearly quality fish. We asked the waiter, likely the son of the owner and was professional and courteous, who recommended the a Spicy Tuna roll. We appreciated this suggestion since it was one of the least expensive items on the menu, which told us he wanted us happy, not just up-selling. We weren't disappointed. They do not take a standard approach to the roll, and it's a must try. By the end of the night, the diners and the staff were all politely conversing and talking, just enjoying the evening.  Fresh seafood,  delicious sushi at a family owned place that clearly wants to win over its customer base. How can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"I do agree that the cost is a little up there, but it was well worth it! I came into the restaurant last night and had an enjoyable time with my friends. The service was impeccable!!! I have been recommending this place since I left. I could afford on a normal weekly occasion, but there is a happy hour until 6pm. The spirit menu was favorably priced and the drinks were amaaaazing. I plan on going in again and I am thankful it is down the street from my home! Thank you for the wonderful experience, Wild Tuna!"}
{"text":"Great family owned sushi joint. The location is small and quiet, staff is super friendly and service is good. The sushi is good quality for the price, and is conveniently located in our neighborhood. They use very fresh ingredients and a good size menu. I'm a no-frills sushi kind of girl (no tempura or mayo for me, thank you!), and typically order a spicy roll and sashimi. Their spicy tuna and California rolls are delicious (real crab is a big plus), and sashimi is very fresh and tasty. We really enjoy coming here!"}
{"text":"For Arizona, this is the best sushi I have had so far in town. It's in a strip mall and while it's painted nicely, this is not some super fancy, upscale sushi spot.  The service is always timely. The family have gotten to know us well through conversation, and they remember our names.   The chef cares very much about the quality of his fish. He will ask us every time what our evaluation is of the yellowtail sashimi-- it is the buttery-est yellowtail you can get, as far as I have tried. I still have other places to try (Sumomaya, Sushi Roku) but for a fairly reasonable price, I drive from Midtown for this place when I can (because what is near Midtown is not that good)."}
{"text":"GREAT food, service, owners, atmosphere as well as friendly patrons."}
{"text":"I'm kicking myself in the ass for not trying this place before tonight! I always thought this place was some modern-style sushi place that we have way too much of in the valley. I was shocked to find out it's actually owned by a Japanese couple that actually know how to make really good sushi. This is hands down, the best, freshest, sushi I have had in Phoenix in the past decade!  I've lived in Japan and my wife is Japanese, so we are always on the lookout for something wothwhile. This place is it. I didn't experience the service issues other people had (in fact, my service was great), but the food was so much more superior than any of the more expensive sushi joints in town.  For reference, I had the salmon, tuna, mackerel, smoked salmon, eel, and yellow tail. We also had the spider (softshell crab) rolls, vegetable tempura, and seaweed salad. All excellent."}
{"text":"I am very impressed with the quality of the fish here! When a person has enough sushi, they get to recognize, and appreciate, a chef who delivers fine fish. I don't live in Phoenix, but if I did, I'd be a regular! The restaurant was very clean and neat when I went, and it was nice to see that the staff was a family. The Dynamite roll is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The inside looks brand new even though it's 8 years old, the owner and son are so friendly, and the food is delicious!  We started with the squid salad, which was the best we've ever had. Not rubbery at all, and lots of flavor. On the roll front, we had the Arachnophobia, the Fire in the Hole, the Dyn-O-Mite, the Philadelphia (for the little) and the Red Zeppelin (from their daily specials). They taste like nothing I've had before. Their spicy mix is not mayo based, so it's much lighter but still has that great spicy taste. The creaminess comes from the fish itself, which was so fresh I'd say it was caught 5 minutes before if we weren't in the desert! We also had tuna, salmon, and yellowtail nigiri. I've had good sushi, great sushi, and terrible sushi. This was better than all those, hands down. I could split the salmon with my tongue...no biting necessary. I also had the Gold Coast martini, which was perfectly made. This is one of those trifecta of perfect places: great food, great service, and great ambiance. The prices are really good too compared to other places I've been and definitely a steal for the quality of food you're getting. Please support a local business and nourish your soul with some Wild Tuna deliciousness."}
{"text":"Amazing small place a hidden jem.  We tried four tolls and all of them are amazing.  The dynamite roll was one of the best rolls I have had in months.  It's worth a trip out to this place to have an amazing meal."}
{"text":"Wild Tuna's is a cute little out of the way place, always a great atmosphere. Good for dates or small groups. I love the famliy vibe of this place! They always remember you when you come in :) FANTASTIC fresh fish, especially the salmon. I also love that they have something interesting on special!"}
{"text":"We tried Wild Tuna's recently.   I can't say that I would go back as the pices are high, the sushi is just OK, and the amibience and service are sub par.  Likes:   The Green Eggs and Ham roll had a nice bite to it and I liked it  Dislikes:  The sushi.  The choices are very limited, the portions are very small for the price, and the presentation is poor.  The spider roll was not as good as others in the area, too oily for my taste.  Beverages:  Although it has the word spirits in it's name don't expect too much.  They carry only one \"Japanese\" beer Asahi which is made by Miller in the US.  There is no menu for Sake so you have to just order it with no idea on what it is or what it will cost.  Even the non-alcoholic choices are poor.  If you order tea (usually pretty good in most sushi restaurants) you'll get a crappy teabag in a large stainless steel pot producing a poor excuse for a cup of tea.  Bottom line:  If you like Sushi, go elsewhere, you will spend less money, get better food, and have a more positive experience"}
{"text":"This was the perfect little sushi place we were looking for.  The food was great and the staff was excellent!"}
{"text":"Ummm... When there is a roll called \"the Barbie roll\" you order it, and you're definitely not disappointed, it comes out wrapped in pink rice paper!!! This place is great! I love local haunts, and the service is impeccable. Highly recommend Wild Tunas!"}
{"text":"I don't eat fish so I'm not sure how much my review is worth but on my first visit recently the chef made me the most wonderful veggie roll -he even did it without the seaweed which I hate!  Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted a simple date night and found this restaurant on yelp. We went right at 5pm when they opened and were the only customers. The staff quickly greeted us. We sat at the bar and ordered happy hour drinks. It's a family owned restaurant and the father and son were quick to suggest items, talk sports (since my husband was wearing a White Sox hat) and were, just overall, very accommodating.   The food was delicious and reasonably priced. We orders a special roll, Tropic Thunder...a delicious combination of salty fish with sweet mango. It should be on the regular menu.   Overall, we were very impressed and happy that it's so close to our house. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Wild Tuna for several years - since it opened. It is family run with great food and service."}
{"text":"I came in last night for the first time, and all I can say is WOW! This sushi tasted so fresh, and the flavors blended together perfectly. We ordered salmon sushi, caterpillar roll, dynamite roll, and wild tuna roll. They were all amazing. The dynamite was my personal favorite. The waiter was really nice and personable too. We also had a raspitini and lemon drop, and they were delicious. Not too strong, and perfectly blended. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place has really good Sushi, but note, they only serve Sushi and Drinks, and a smattering of Japanese Apps. Like Gyoza and Tempura. Having said that, the staff is really nice, even when they were super slammed like they were tonight.  The Sushi and Sashimi itself is really top notch.  I usually stick the the traditional forms of Sushi (Sushi, Sashimi, Hand Rolls)  My girl likes the Americanized Maki or roll types.  I was converted to the American Maki at this place.  It was all well balanced, and really, really delicious.  Try the Rasta Roll, it was awesome. All in all a really good place to go for Sushi."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat sushi my kids love it. They where very nice ppl. I wish I had a longer vacation to come back here. Until next time Arizona"}
{"text":"We decided to venture out from our normal sushi spot, hoping to find another place that we could go to regularly.  The restaurant itself seemed clean and the ambiance was nice.  The menu was not all that big for special rolls, and majority of them were similar. We ordered three rolls and gyoza. It seemed like we waited for quite some time before getting our food. There was just nothing \"wow\" about them. They were pretty pricey. Our meal came to almost $50 and we both left feeling still pretty hungry and disappointed with what we ate. We kind of wished we had just went and bought mediocre grocery store sushi. Pretty bummed, we really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Wild tuna is not only the best in Phoenix they now are serving Poke lunch and it is fabulous ! The family is all there. Everyone should try it!!   everything is fast and fresh 5 stars in my book! We have needed something new in Moon Valley for a long time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the valley for sushi rolls... and a few other items that you can't get anywhere else! ...and I can practice my Japanese... the chef/owner and hostess of the restaurant are Japanese, so that's refreshing.  Before I begin, I should state that if you like eating sashimi and nigiri type sushi, this review may not help you as I stay more on the cooked and maki side of the sushi world... which is why this place is where I crave to go when I feel like sushi! They aren't traditional--actually quite daring and exploratory in their rolls, and not afraid of entertaining  customer requests.  Of their standard specialty rolls, my favorites are the Surf & Turf (This is the perfect roll to introduce to people who have never eaten sushi or that like meals that are more Steak house), Crunch & Munch, Mango Fandango, Sancho (sans cream cheese--HATE that ingredient in sushi) and a little known roll that Chef Yama makes for the foodie-daring: Frito Bandido (Yes, made with Fritos for that corn crunch!). If you don't see a roll on the menu or the daily specials board, ask for it anyway, if they have the ingredients, Chef Yama will make it.  Unlike other reviews, I think that Wild Tuna's prices are quite reasonable for a sushi restaurant, especially when it comes to standard rolls like spicy tuna, spider, California & eel rolls--$1-$4 cheaper than some of their competitors.  A word of caution, if you don't like sauce, I suggest you tell Chef Yama to tone it down, because here, it's all about the sauces. Though I admit, they can be overwhelming (ex. Eel Roll)... but sometimes for the better... case in point The Surf & Turf. My usual Wild Tuna's buddy and I will order a spider roll which is quite sauceless to sop up the leftover sesame sauce... trick: leave at least one S&T roll on the plate, or the waitress may take the dish with all that saucy goodness away!   Outside the world of sushi, the hidden gem that always pleases the crowd: Magic Mushrooms. Just get them... you won't be sorry! But make sure they've cooled down a bit before popping one in your mouth.  And for dessert? Ringo Tempura. Fried wedges of battered apples drizzled with chocolate & caramel syrup with a dollop of whip cream. Delish!  I hear they have a pretty good but slim time frame for Happy Hour 5-6 M-Sa. I will have to try it one day... but even if I don't, I'll definitely still frequent the place!"}
{"text":"Came with my roomy for the literal happy hour and It was definitely a good experience. Happy hour is 5-6 and they just take 15% off select items so you're really not saving much. I got the shrimp tempura roll which was surprisingly plain but it tasted fresh. I also got the fire-in-the-hole roll and it tasted great but was falling apart on me. Or server was super nice and very attentive so that was great! Plus I few obligated to say that the water tasted good, I know it's stupid but I'm finding more and more places have water that tastes like it's from a hose. My biggest problem with this place was that the menu was pretty small and plain and the special rolls were just out of my price range. I feel like you get your money's worth as far as quality I just wouldn't be able to afford this place as a go to sushi place."}
{"text":"First time here and we're looking for our new sushi place since we're new to the neighborhood. We found It! Great place, fun atmosphere and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Great Mom and Pop joint! Sucks that they're closed Sun"}
{"text":"Very poor service. Had to wait for one of the tables to be cleaned off, even though many of them were empty.  Our appetizer came out after everything else. I ordered 4 rolls, they only brought 2,and then asked \"Do you still want them\" when they tried to take my plate away when I was waiting for the rest of my order. They charged me for the extra sauce I ordered for the 2 rolls they never delivered. Will never return."}
{"text":"Got some sushi for take out, and I have to say - it doesnt compare in flavor to several other places in the Valley I have gone to, and the price is higher...  and when I asked for some extra eel sauce, the chef acted like I had asked for his first born!!  And then put about 1 teasoon of sauce in a little plastic cup - Gee thanks!  total bummer because this place is super close to me..."}
{"text":"In short; get the spicy tuna! You won't find it better than here. It's the hands down, best in the valley. You really can't go wrong with ordering any roll here, though as everything tastes so fresh!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the price was a bit high considering the quantity, quality and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ate here once a while ago and it was pretty good. But the other night I called to order some food to go, and nobody answered the phone. Tried again a while later and still no answer. I decided just to drive over and order in person, but when I got there they were closed. It was almost an hour before their posted closing time and there was no sign saying they were closing early. The food is decent but I guess they close early if it's a slow night."}
{"text":"Awesome specials. They greet you with a happy smile .We have always enjoyed every thing we have tried  .Just around corner form home love it .we will bring guest and family in the future."}
{"text":"Super delicious place, with high energy staff.  When I walked in the place was super busy, but the staff was super friendly and I had a table quickly.  Great place for Friday or Saturday night dinner. I would definitely recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Finally tried this little gem tonight and it is officially my favorite sushi spot.  The food is divine and the service is welcoming and delightful.  Please don't tell anyone else.  I would love for this treasure to keep its quaint and peaceful charm forever."}
{"text":"This was my first sushi experience and it was glorious. My gf is a former server in a renowned sushi bar and she ended up knowing some of the same chefs as the chef/owner here. He has been a sushi chef here in the US since the 80s at least. I can't wait to return the next time I'm in N. Phoenix."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place and so glad i did. Great family owned sushi place. Very cute decor inside and fantastic sushi! We had The Hot Chick, Philadelphia Roll, and the Arachnophobia Roll. Damn good! Happy hour is from 5-6 with a various selection of rolls."}
{"text":"Everyone needs a local sushi dive, where saki is poured when needed and sashimi reigns supreme. Wild Tuna fills the bill. Happy hour roll specials on week nights make the perfect stop in after a long day. The only waitress is friendly if only just competent, but the job gets done and the rolls are scrumptious. Make sure to drop in before 7 to get the half off specials."}
{"text":"Great Service and a hidden gem 2 minutes from Pointe North Tapatio Cliffs resort! Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place ! They always try some new combinations and the sushi is fresh and yummy ! The only thing better than the food is the service. Everyone is polite, they really try to understand your taste and recommend tasty choices. Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"We had the Me Soy Horny and salad to start, followed by the Poke, Salmon and Garfunkle, Surf and Turf, and Protein Bomb. We ended our lovely meal with warm house Sake, Green tea ice cream and churro tots  We will definitely call me back here again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I live in the area and come to Wild Tuna every so often.  The sushi is always excellent and so is the customer service.  They have a great happy hour deal too."}
{"text":"I always judge a sushi place by the quality of their sashimi- we went in after some friends recommended this place, ordered the yellowtail sashimi to test the waters, and mmmmmmmm AWESOME.  We also got the \"fire in the hole\" specialty roll which was spicy yellowtail, shrimp tempura, cucumber, avocado, cream cheese, and also DELICIOUS.  Great service, atmosphere, and luckily not far from our house :)  This will be our new regular sushi spot. Glad we discovered it."}
{"text":"I have been to Wild Tuna twice, in the last two weeks. My boyfriend and I love this place. Tonight, just to share, we had miso soup, Philadelphia roll, Rainbow roll, the Salmon and Garfunkel and the Surf and Turf. In my opinion, they were all well worth the money. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Great sushi! It's a local family owned restaurant that puts quality first.  This is always our choice for sushi. Wonderful drinks, food and atmosphere, plus the price is great.  Really easy to find with plenty of parking.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi I have ever had in the Valley. I love the family run atmosphere and everyone is so welcoming and friendly the bubba gump and TNT rolls were so amazing. I can not wait to go back and get my sushi fix again!"}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place was the edamame.    The lack of wine list was a total turn off.  The drink menu period was not good at all.    The sushi was overpriced and lacked the freshness I am used to.    I like trying new places.  This is one I won't return to."}
{"text":"The food, service, atmosphere and drinks were all 5 star!! The only reason I put a 4 star review is because the tables were sticky. Would go back in the drop of a dime!"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi in Phoenix! Highly recommend..... EVERYTHING. Tuna here is fantastic, the soft shell crab is rockin' and the owners are some of the nicest people in Moon Valley! If you have a chance to visit, just do it!"}
{"text":"Everything is good but they do have the Best spicy tuna roll ever. Super friendly staff. Love this place"}
{"text":"I had given up on local sushi, but this place exceeded all expectations!  Father & son place knows good tuna (they have a different take on spicy tuna, they call it \"poki tuna\" and spice it the Hawaiian way).  The dynamite roll (involved scallop-y goodness + miso glaze) was delicious, but the spicy tuna is not only different, it's way better than the norm."}
{"text":"AMAZING service! Tyler and his family provide excellent customer service. They definitely remember their regular customers! They explain the menu very thoroughly and answer any questions you have! Happy Hour every day 5pm-6pm. This is a must try place!"}
{"text":"Short: Get the Spicy Tuna Roll and for some reason I order entirely too many Gyoza orders but that explains why I'm fat.   Longer: Wild Tunas was another case of me going to a restaurant when it first opened and being disappointed likely because they're still figuring it out but coming back to give it another chance and loving it. I'm bummed I waited years to come back but it's probably safe to say we are legitimately \"regulars\" here now. We've been known to come 4 times in a week which is a lot for us at least. Service is great. It's a family operation and Tyler and Yom are genuinely nice dudes. It's awesome when there aren't many people there because you can have great conversation with them. That said, it's been getting really busy lately and they could probably use some more help but they do their best!  So onto the food, it's good solid sushi. We usually get the basics but the basics are quality. The salmon sashimi is fresh. The Spicy Tuna is simple and deliciously spicy. The Dynamite is top notch too.   All around good stuff! I'd have to save the 5 stars for a place like Nobu, but Wild Tuna is nothing to scoff at! I just don't want it to get too popular because or go-to nice spot when we want to eat well but stay in Moon valley."}
{"text":"We are new to the Phoenix area and like sushi.  We read the reviews and chose this because of them.  We did take-out today and unfortunately we were quite disappointed. I picked up our order on a Wednesday evening at 6:15 and there was no one eating there.  The sushi was really not very good. The rolls were not bad, but the sushi and sashimi were not cold enough. We will keep looking."}
{"text":"Nice little family sushi place in my neighborhood. I've been here a few times and haven't been disappointed. The service is good, the sushi roll selection is better than most places, sashimi is fresh.  The only complaint I have about Wild Tuna is their limited hours. Open for a few hours for dinner only, and not open Sunday or Monday."}
{"text":"Excellent experience with great food and service.  None of the problems on other reviews.    We have lived near hear for the entire time it has been open but had not stopped in.  Really glad we went up.  Very limited hours, Mon-Sat 5pm until ??.  But we will definitely be back.  Our normal Sushi place is Cherry Noodle Blossom, but each of the four plates tried was better than anything I have had at noodle blossom.  Very very fresh.  Complaints?  Only that I missed the light on the way up and had to come back south to it.  Can't blame them for my mad navigation skills."}
{"text":"The rolls were good but a little small for the price, the wait was long for not being busy."}
{"text":"This place is extremely good. Try the fake & bake (spicy) and the Bubba Gump. Definitely one of the best sushi places in Phoenix. We were very happy with everything and the owners were friendly."}
{"text":"Love the modern vibe. Simple and elegant design. Tuna roll was outstanding. Spicy yellow tail was deliciously spicy."}
{"text":"Decided to check out my local sushi restaurant after moving into my new apartment on Thunderbird. I've been in the mood for sushi ALL day and today was the perfect day to check it out. I came right after work and it wasn't too busy, only 2 other groups in the restaurant.   I was immediately greeted by the waitress who was super friendly and attentive. She helped describe different rolls to me to help me find the roll I was thinking of. They unfortunately were out of miso soup but I had to \"settle\" with the gyoza (pot stickers) which were pretty dang yummy since they were boiled and then fried on one side.   Ate up my shrimp tempura before I could take a picture...sorry. But the shrimp was crunchy, warm, and delicious.   I was still hungry so decided to order the captain crunch roll. A few Yelp reviews raved of it and the pictures looked awesome so I just had to try it. It was also on the happy hour menu (15% off) so that was an added plus. This is definitely going to be my regular sushi spot!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food! Pride of ownership truly shines through at this family-owned restaurant. Chef has a great sense of humor and other family members are very helpful, polite and friendly. We will definitely become regulars and bring others!"}
{"text":"Sushi is one of my favorite foods and I've sampled a lot of different places. I really enjoyed the quality here. It was quick and delicious. I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Not only was this the best sushi I have had, but the customer service is stellar. Everyone is so attentive to your needs and makes an honest effort to make dining with them a pleasure. I wish I could give a higher rating because they deserve it. Thanks you guys!!"}
{"text":"This was my second time trying this place. My experience was much like the first, except they were much busier this time.   This is sushi, sashimi, and apps only. The menu has your  typical sushi and rolls, but they do have some very unique menu items and daily specials. I had two sushi orders and a spider roll, edemame to start. It was serviceable and comparable to what I've had elsewhere.  Why's they get two stars? First, I ordered my roll \"no avocado\" , as I'm allergic.  The bill even said \"no avocado\". Guess what, lots of avocado on my roll.   Just like my first time here, I noticed that things taste funny. The fried soft shell crab in the roll tasted like old oil, while the sushi rice was too vinegary. Even the soy sauce was funky, with a chemical taste.   Service is slightly less than what I expect from a sushi place. It's obviously family; the guy, his wife, and their kid, along with a dude int he back frying stuff up. If they would grease up the customers a little and ask if they want a drink or dessert, I'll bet that they would make more money every night.   I need a neighborhood sushi spot, so I'm going to give them one more shot."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this place! Awesome poke lunches. Super nice service and only $8 for the best lunch ever."}
{"text":"We always enjoy the fresh fish. The family that owns Wild Tuna makes you feel welcome and cared for. Tonight I had some of the best yellow tail. Great for families or date night."}
{"text":"I was leery of trying another strip mall sushi joint, but my girlfriend got me to go and i'm glad we did.  It was our first time there and we arrived just after the dinner rush which worked out perfectly.  I had Tuna, Yellowtail and Salmon sushi.  This was some of he best sushi i have had in Phoenix.  They truly distinguished themselves by the quality of their fish.  We also enjoyed the Protein Roll and TNT.  I even got an extra order of Tuna since it was so good. The service was great and we will definitely be back. Cheers."}
{"text":"How I love this place! My fiancé and I have been coming here for years and I am just writing this review. What can I say...consistently amazing and fresh sashimi, delicately sweet amaebi, super tasty spicy tuna rolls (unlike any you have had before) and great service. This family owned restaurant always satisfies my sushi cravings. Regardless if you are in the mood for rolls, sashimi or any other Japanese yumminess, don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Great poke bowls for lunch. The family who owns the place is very nice. Great service and fresh food, we'll be back."}
{"text":"The only :) you saw here were on the menu to indicate happy hour menu items, and by hour I literally mean hour 5-6 only.  Overall the menu is fairly standard, but the prices are a bit higher than I expected for a neighborhood store front style join.   We started with a small bowl of miso soup $2 and edamame $3.80 however it arrived with the meal and not as an app.  For rolls we went light with a TNT roll $11.50 Inside was cream cheese, yellow tail and asparagus, no rice all tempura battered and fried. Served on a bed of yuzu sauce and siriacha. The yellow tail was a bit well done for a sushi roll nearly all grey, and the flavors just did not pop in my mouth.  The spicy tuna was mediocre ($6.80) but for that price I was expecting something bigger and or better, it was preseasoned with soy for some reason.   Service was decent. but we were the only table at 8:30. None of us got sick either so that is a pro but given the value to portion size flavor and quality I have to say seek other options."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place! We had been trying to remember to go there for sushi for months now... We finally went there for dinner Friday night and I fell in love with their Las Vegas roll! Their customer service was awesome, everything was so fresh and their prices are great, not expensive at all! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food great atmosphere and good people!  What else more can you ask for?  All special rolls are worth trying and the desert is unique! Personal favorite roll for wife is Here's Nemo, mine is Sashimi mix."}
{"text":"fresh fishies. super friendly, quick service. PERFECT iced green tea. this place was such a great find. I love love love a long running \"hole in the wall\" sushi spot. a million compliments to the chef. tip - always check the blackboard."}
{"text":"This place is so great ! It's a small neighborhood sushi place that's family owned and operated ! The family always makes sure you like your food and takes care of you . We feel like family when we walk through the door ! By the way , everything on the menu is amazing ! The rolls are packed full of delicious ingredients and the appetizers never disappoint !"}
{"text":"AGH! I hate giving this place 3 stars because you can tell it is a family owned restaurant and the owners were so nice but I am forced to dock off 2 stars for several reasons.  Let me begin with the fact that this one of the freshest tuna I have had in my life and I've had world class tuna from all over the world. Most of the rolls tasted fresh and some of them had unique tastes, like the buffalo shrimp with ranch. Interesting combination but good nonetheless. Also they are waaaaay slower than regular sushi joints however given the quality of the sushi I am not docking stars because of this.  Their prices reminded of the prices of a sushi joint in the east valley however without the Scottsdale atmosphere; they are definitely somewhat high for what you would expect from a strip mall sushi joint. I saw that they have happy hour, which by the way it is LITERALLY 1 hour, definitely go in these 60 minutes if you are budget conscious. As I prepared to dig into the sushi goodness,  I asked for a low-sodium option of soy sauce and the teen waitress told me that they didn't had one, REALLY what place in the 21st century does not have options for the health conscious? Finally one thing that REALLY bothered me was that I was charged $1 extra for a side of Sriracha, I have NEVER been charged for this anywhere else.   Overall top quality sushi and somewhat high prices, however the fact that I was nickled and dimed for a side of Sriracha when I spent over $90 and the smell of old cleaning cloth on my table will make me think twice before stopping here again."}
{"text":"This is my second time here.  I came back because of how nice the waiter was and how amazing their sushi was!  Their eel Diablo roll is one of my favorites.  This place is the friendliest place I have been too and they make you feel like long time friends or even family when you done here.  They also have good prices.  Love them so much"}
{"text":"The sushi was deeeeelicious!!! Super secret good! I was surprised cause it was a hidden gym"}
{"text":"This place was alright. it's very bright and colorful inside, which was nice, but the food wasn't anything to write home about. The miso soup was made from powder, as was the wasabi, which was a dissapointment. We ordered smoked salmon sashimi, that didn't look all together fresh. The only thing that saved this place was their Dy-No-Mite roll. I would suggest this to anyone who asks. All in all, not my first choic of sushi places."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that this place is Hands down best sushi in Arizona.   I've been coming here for about a year now and haven't been to any other sushi place since (except RA, for a birthday party) which was more expensive, loud and lower quality.   This is a family run establishment and a very nice, personal environment. You will never have a bad experience here, they aren't the quickest in town because they pride themselves with quality food and service.   Again, I will never eat anywhere else."}
{"text":"The best sushi and some little different blends with fun names that tell what it all about.  Wife likes the Maui Wowie (chicken she does not like raw fish).  I like the Surf & Turf and Dynamite is really special. iYam iYam (veggie) is a new one worth trying.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"This is an amazing sushi place. The dynamite roll is really tasty. The business is family owned and run and very friendly. Highly, highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is usually busy, but they take care of everybody wonderfully.  The service was excellent!  My favorite part was the sushi that was made - Every roll I received was so good that it required absolutely no soy sauce.  It really had a flavor of it's own that would be detracted by the soy/wasabi.  I'll go here again, definitely."}
{"text":"Stopped in had sushi a second time this last week and was not disappointed. It's a really fun little spot. Family run business, which I love, and wonderful fare. 5-6pm is their happy hour on, oh I'd say, 1/3 of their rolls. They play fun music and serve beer. I'm definitely making this place our go-to spot when were in this part of town.  Our favorite rolls were the tuna, shrimp tempura, and the captain crunch!"}
{"text":"Well it was my first time there last night! And wow, I've had better gas station sushi! I ordered 5 rolls for the family and it was all gross and avocado was completely brown and gross, the tuna was dry and nasty. Even the wasabi was gross. And these were tiny size rolls,Let's just say i will never return there. 58 bucks down the drain."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here as often as we can, the yellowtail is some of the best we've ever had.  We usually try one of the specialty rolls and are never disappointed.  Tonight we came to celebrate our anniversary and it was wonderful as always.  We ate our usual-- spicy tuna, yellowtail, and rainbow rolls which were delicious and stuffed to the brim with fresh fish.  We also tried a few specialty rolls including the Fire in the Hole and Squid Vicious which were both amazing!  We also always share a miso soup, cucumber salad and dinner salad which are always fresh and yummy.  The dinner salad is a mixed greens with a ginger dressing that I adore!  The server, Tyler, is so friendly and attentive and the sushi chef is also kind and generous in his dishes!  This place is truly a gem, we will come back and recommend to all!!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to grab sushi! Every visit is always enjoyable, their staff is very attentive and friendly, food is always fresh and delicious, and wonderful ambiance to eat in."}
{"text":"Location:  Easy to access and get to. It's so near my home I'm disappointed I haven't tried it before. Parking is easy as well. 5  Decor: I said to my friend, get ready  to walk into a fishbowl as we entered. It is definitely bright.  I prefer to have a more  mellow place to eat but the food made up for it! 2.5  Service: No hostess but greated quickly. Tyler was the server he is energetic, friendly,  knowledgeable, and gave great suggestions. I did have to wait for water but I drink  a lot. 4.5  Food: OMG. SERIOUSLY. THE FOOD!!! We got edamame, typical but came out so hot. I enjoyed that.   Spicy Tuna: Different and best  version ever. The family is from Hawaii and they do the sushi poke style. Trust me you want this.  Dynamite: best thing you will put in your mouth. I don't normally do baked  or cooked rolls but I tried it and ordered another. So so so good. Cali roll with scallops on top. Just do it.  Rasta: jerk flavors. Every bite was packed with flavor. Different and so good. Another favorite. Captain Crunch: spicy  crab, with tempura Crunch and eel sauce.  We got another I forgot what it was called but simple. Clean and good. 5  Happy Hour: 15% off and on food only. Kind of weak. Do a couple rolls that are special a week or idk create a special for 50% less. Also 0 drinks on happy hour. They have only a few hours of service so I understand why but my bill would have been bigger if there were drinks on HH for sure. 2  Overall  it's my new favorite because of its location, family owned, and food. I'd go again and again."}
{"text":"Owner is very nice fish is amazing!  This is my new favorite spot. Definitely is a hidden gem !"}
{"text":"Solid spot. Fresh fish and great prices. Seriously what else do you need in a sushi spot. I like their spicy tuna because they use soy sauce in it! I wanted to try their protein bomb...looks like the sh*t but I didn't think the hubs would be down. We went with the Capn Crunch because that's the goto comfort sushi food the hubs needs when he ventures to a new sushi place. It did not disappoint but it wasn't the star. The standout for me was the wild tuna roll. The dynamite roll was bomb, the hubs discovered that he likes squid salad. All in all a solid place. Will be back. Won't bring the child, just a smaller place and when a child screams it's very loud. Good service."}
{"text":"What a great hole in the wall find! So glad we stumbled upon this place, right down the street from our house.  The food was great- not a HUGE selection, but good. Spicy Tuna was a breath of fresh air- it wasn't bathing in mayo. Actually, there was NO mayo. And it had just the right amount of \"spicy.\"   I wish the menu had happy hour prices. When we asked, the waitress/owner/wife said, \"we'll take a little off.\" It was pretty nondescript, so we didn't know if happy hour meant \"half off\" or like, \"a dollar off.\"   Either way, the food was good, reasonably priced to begin with, and the service and atmosphere were just perfect for a neighborhood sushi joint. Not showy, not loud, not snooty... just good sushi and friendly owners. I recommend everyone tries this! Minus one star for not having a very awesome happy hour deal :)"}
{"text":"Tried out Wild Tuna finally.  Like others mentioned, it's a little stripmall place, but they did a nice job decorating to make it more interesting than a strip mall.  The modern atmosphere is somewhat cold if you are used to dimly lit, romantic sushi places.    When we arrived and glanced at the menu I thought it was slightly overpriced, but much to my pleasure, we had conveniently arrived during their happy hour and they give 20% off all sushi, yippee!  (it's a small window, Monday-Saturday 5-6pm)    We had the smoked salmon sashimi, yellow tail sashimi and one of their special rolls along with a tasty bottle of wine.  The roll was awesome, the sashimi was perfect, nice thick pieces, very fresh.    Cute little place appears to be the husband behind the sushi counter and wife serving.  She did a nice job.  They didn't have any wine buckets but she thoughtfully put our chardonney in a water pitcher.  Works for me as long as my wine is cold!  I like to support local business owners like this."}
{"text":"Great sushi spot, family owned & operated. You can tell they passionately care about what they do & LOVE what they do.  Went tonight for the 1st time and will become a regular. Great sushi, good specialty rolls.  What makes the difference is the owners, they are great people!"}
{"text":"Not sure if the positive  reviews here are fake or if the place could be so completely night and day  from my experience... My fiance and I went here a couple weeks ago and it was slow but the reviews were good so we ordered 4-5 rolls.  Service was mediocre but what really led to the 1star review(which I NEVER do) :  Several of our rolls came out and my fiance says \"I didn't realize these had eel....\" To our utter shock and dismay!  It was AVOCADO that was so browned and gross that it literally looked black like eel. It was disgusting and we lost our appetite.   Do not go Here!!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally a place to get good sushi in Phoenix! I lived in Phoenix for 20 years and almost always been disappointed with the Sushi.  Finally a place with actually good Sushi like you would  get on the west coast.  Good service, good Sushi"}
{"text":"Another wonderful couple visits- we always feel special and welcome here. We are always impressed with the freshness and quality. When you do the basics this good it is indescribable- salmon with a touch of rice, fresh ginger, wasabi so creamy it's like ice cream and a sliver of lemon on top. Just wow! Love the baked mussels and really you can't go wrong here- all the rolls are something special. Thank you for your commitment to quality in your service and food. Thanks for having a bright, awesome interior. Thanks for sharing your down to earth family hospitality."}
{"text":"We sampled a bunch of different menu items and everything that we had was outstanding. Friendly service too. Great neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Phoenix! It's a family run place with great sushi. It's a smaller place so sometimes it gets a little crowded, so come early!"}
{"text":"Really great sushi and chill atmosphere! The potstickers were crispy and flavorful, the TNT roll was explosively delicious and the rasta roll didn't her us around. It was good time, mon'!"}
{"text":"I have low expectations when it comes to sushi in the phoenix metro area, but the sushi here was pretty good. The ambiance was nice and the staff/chef attentive. I just wish there was more nigiri options since I'm more into nigiri and sashimi than rolls. The sides were also good."}
{"text":"Great place, loved the food it was a quaint place. I give it low ratings due to the exceptionally slow service from our waitress. She was very polite but unfortunately a little disorganized. Took a while for us to be greeted once seated and was checked on enough while we were eating. But once we were done it took 30 minutes to get out of the place, with a whopping total of 3-4 tables seated in the place. Get a second waitress please."}
{"text":"There is a strong possibility that this is the best sushi in Phoenix. For whatever reason, most sushi places stateside never use enough vinegar in their rice. The result is a mediocre, bland experience. When people think of sushi, they think of just fish. Rice is actually the most important ingredient for sushi. Everytime I come here I'm just so blown away by the quality of the rice that I sometimes forget about the quality of the fish (which is always good, as well). Everything on the menu has its strengths, but I recommend the tuna and yellowtail. Prices are on the high end; expect to pay for quality. The owner/chef is nice, and the wait staff is always consistently accommodating. The location itself is nothing special, but there are no glaring drawbacks. Simple and elegant - that is the essense of sushi, and this place gets it right."}
{"text":"A hidden treasure, and open late! Delicious and very fresh sushi, probably the best in town!!! ! I always love coming here, and we are always surprised at how good it is! And the staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"Yes, there is a sushi god, and he has plopped a sushi place right down at Thunderbird and 7th Street.    It's open! and not only is it sushi, it's HAWAIIAN SUSHI!  The place is tiny, very intimate. The walls are deep blue and the seating is like a lot of Japanese bars, very stark... but these are lime green.  The menu is terrific, with all the traditional sushi, sashimi, and extras... plus, they have a ton of really original specialty rolls.  I love their sushi.  I thank the sushi gods because it is in my neighborhood and I can pick up a yummy roll for dinner on my way home.... and I don't even have to go out of the way to do it.  mmmmm..... sushi!"}
{"text":"Dined here with a co-worker recently for dinner, and found it to be a nice little spot to dine and chat. They have some good drinks at the bar, and our sushi was quite nice as well.   My dining partner is not a fan of nori, and she showed me a little trick that apparently every sushi place can do - substituting soy paper for nori. I'd never even heard of the stuff. It's similar in texture, just without the taste. She selected the \"Fire in the Hole\" roll with soy, and we got some nigiri and edamame as well. Here's what we found:  Edamame: Standard fare, nice and salty, quite tasty. A good starter  Salmon nigiri: Featuring a fairly generous cut of nicely marbled fish, it was a tasty bite for both of us. No slime, just yum.   Tuna nigiri: Again, a generous cut, deep dark color, and a good texture, especially considering that sushi here in the desert has to be previously frozen.   Fresh water eel: Flaky, well cooked and perfectly glazed, this was a very good dish. No off flavors or odors at all.   Fire in the Hole roll: Featuring spicy yellowtail, shrimp tempura, cucumber, cream cheese and avocado, with the above-mentioned soy paper instead of nori, this was a fairly large diameter roll that packed a lot in. The spicy yellowtail was definitely spicy, and the tempura and cucumber provided a good crunch, while the cream cheese held the heat a little at bay. Honestly, I kind of liked that the soy paper let the flavors of the filling come through a little more.   All in all, we had a great dining experience here. Our dishes arrived a little out of order, but we got everything and really enjoyed it all."}
{"text":"This place has some seriously awesome sushi during dinner time, and I love that they're now open for lunch serving their poke bowls. Great local family owns it - I can't recommend this place highly enough! If you're looking for high quality sushi and a friendly atmosphere, you've got it with Wild Tuna."}
{"text":"Wow! Fresh fresh fresh!  Great service from a real mom and pop place.  The spicy dynamite roll was outstanding."}
{"text":"5star for sure. Staying at the Hilton Tapatico hotel down the street. Decided to try this sushi place based on the high railings and reviews. Was not busy at 630pm(opens at 5 happy hour until 6 I believe). Sushi was top notch. Service was so so so good. The waiter (son of the sushi chef I believe) was the most helpful and friendly waiter I've ever had....anywhere. Typical pencil order sushi menu, 20oz Japanese beers $7, and excellent sushi. If you are in north phoenix area this is the place for sushi. I am from northern NJ/NY and this tops most of the places I've been too for food but def for service."}
{"text":"It's right by my house. Its not bad at all. The cuts of sashimi are huge (which probably aren't \"regulation\"), but who cares they are decent. Definitely not the same as going to get sushi in a coastal town, but not bad for being close to where I am located.   They seem to be family run and owned. The fish was fresh, which is a lot better than most places, which serve you fish which....just tastes old.   Their rolls were mediocre at best. if you live near by and can make it to their happy hour, which you can miss if you blink, then definitely stop by.   It did not convince me to not make the long drive to my favorite place though."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years. It is a family owned, family run business and they are the nicest people and a big reason we come back. File this under random, but my wife had sushi for the first time in Steamboat, Colorado in 1998 and they owned and ran the sushi restaurant in town back then. Obviously they moved to Phoenix at some point and it was quite  serendipitous that our little neighborhood sushi restaurant was owned and run by the same family!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Wait at times was long but worth the wait. They were quite busy when I came in. Yellowtail sashimi was delicious. Fire in the hole roll with shrimp tempura came out so hot and spicy. Mouth watering. So glad we great sushi place in the north valley."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great customer service. Everything is fresh and delicious! It's not expensive at all. Definitely my sushi spot!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this incredible place so close to our house!! The Wild Tuna Roll is out of this world!  Super speedy and so kind and helpful! We shall be regulars!"}
{"text":"I'm currently here for business and I just left the restaurant. I basically had sushi the past four days at different restaurants...  I'm staying at the Hilton Tapatio, so I was keeping an eye out for local restaurants. I have to admit, the logo caught my eye, so I decided to look it up on Yelp.  Here's the lowdown:  Likes: Surf n Turf (wonders what it would be like with Kobe beef) Green tea ice cream Looks like a fun place for a first date - if you both know how to use chopsticks. Women like men with good finger dexterity. But you might not get a lot of privacy, it can get loud as you can easily hear other people's conversations.  Okay: Rainbow roll  Dislikes: Hotate with Mayo Does not accept American Express (my corporate card)  The restaurant looks fairly new - then again, just about every business around here doesn't look more than 5 years old.  I was here on a Monday night at 6:50pm. Besides myself, there was a family sitting at the sushi bar and two young women at a nearby table.  I was greeted kindy by the Chef, who looks like he probably owns the place. And I was immediately told to take any available seat.  I'm assuming the waitress was the wife of the Chef and she asked me if it was my first time. Based on the demographics of this area, I take it not a lot of asians / filipinos live in this area. She handed me a paper menu that had traditional sushi / sashimi / rolls / salads / appetizers on the front, and the specialty rolls with expanded descriptions on the back.  I don't drink alcohol, so I ordered a Pepsi, so she brought out a can with a glass of ice filled with my drink.  When I'm new to a sushi joint, I usually try to look for a baseline that I'm familiar with. For me, my favorite is the Rainbow Roll from Sushi Sams in San Mateo.   Wild Tuna's Rainbow roll was under $9 bucks, which seems like a deal, but it was relatively small, which is okay because I hate big rolls which make me take two bites and gets messy. But at the price, they do put good size pieces of fish. I only like Salmon and Tuna on mine, and they were happy to grant my request at no extra charge. I also asked if they could put real crab meat (yes folks, a lot of sushi joints use the fake crap) - but unfortunately, they were out.  In the back of my mind, I can't help but wonder how fresh Sushi could be out in the middle of the desert called Phoenix. I am a bit spoiled by the availability of \"fresh off the boat\" fish in the San Francisco bay area.  The salmon tasted great, which means, no fishy smell or flavor. The tuna, wasn't as high a grade of tuna that I'm used to, but it wasn't bad considering that I'm nowhere near the ocean.  They used very little, as in quantity, shredded fake crab meat, but it is better than the fake king crab leg meat that Yaso served me last week.  I also ordered Hotate (scallops) with mayo. I usually save that for last if it is really good, but I ate it first along with cucumber salad that came out the same time. Based on this experience, I probably wouldn't order it again. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't very good either. There was a very slight taste of fishiness to it (i'm picky), so the vinegar like tanginess of the cucumber salad masked the taste.  Finally, my Surf n Turf came out! This was Shrimp tempura and grilled enochi mushrooms topped with seared beef and finished with a tangy sesame dressing with a hint of onion.  Although the rice was drenched in the light soy like sauce, the flavor was rich and the steak was buttery tender. I would come back just for this.  Forget about the traditional stuff - which you can get anywhere else for a better deal and taste. But, I have a feeling that this place is known for its specialty rolls.  I topped off my dinner with green tea ice cream. I love green tea ice cream and this was really good! If you have never tried it, it is an acquired taste, but once you love it, you want to have it again and again.  My bill came out to be $32. I usually would split much with my wife, so your bill should come out cheaper if you share - unless your eyes are bigger than your stomach like mine. I'm still STUFFED as I write this.  Since there was no \"eye candy\" to watch (as a previous poster noted), I ended up watching the large screen tv they had behind the bar. I guess Monday nights are slow nights. It's okay, I was served quickly and was in and out of there so I could check into my Hotel."}
{"text":"I lived right by this place for a while and only recently discovered what an awesome place it is; wish I had know about it sooner!  The food is always very fresh and the staff are the most polite and considerate severs I have witnessed.  A couple of the customers who walked in were greeted by name and they had a very friendly conversation together.  I'm addicted to the Dyn-O-Mite Roll, so delicious!!  The salad is very fresh and the dressing they use is so flavorful, it has a slight kick. The restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated; it's always a huge bonus to have a clean bathroom."}
{"text":"Out of all of the sushi places in the area, this is my favorite. Very laid back and honest people here. The enviroment is very relaxing. The plum wine is amazing and my favorite roll is the Barbie roll. If you are in the area, definitely stop by this place!"}
{"text":"Great sushi place. It is fresh!!!!!! You may have a bit of a wait as it appears it is only one person making it but it is so worth it!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I have been here quite a few times now and it has quickly become our favorite! Come with friends and family or come alone. The food will NOT disappoint! Super fresh tasting and cold, which may seem strange sounding but who wants lukewarm sushi? The family who own it are always welcoming and kind and they always ask genuinely, how your food tastes. Totally recommend to all my friends!!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best sushi in Phoenix.  The owner and his wife are always there and they definitely take pride in their food, which is awesome.  The hand rolls are excellent and the sashimi is fresh.  This place is tight."}
{"text":"Hidden gem for sure! Great food, staff and service!"}
{"text":"Sign out front reads \"Wild tuna sushi and spirits\"  Walk inside and man behind counter says \"All we have is poke bowls\"  Me - \"oh wow, I thought you guys had sushi based on your sign\"  Man behind counter - \"Once again..all we have is poke bowls\"  Odd way to treat potential customers..interesting business strategy."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZEBALLS OMG! I don't think I've ever had a better spicy tuna roll in my life. It was flavorful, just the right amount of spice and not a huge amount of rice.   The owners are a family and VERY nice. The service isn't the quickest, but they make up that in sushi quality and low prices.   My go to is the spicy tuna roll, tuna roll, yellowtail nigiri and a specialty roll I can't think of right now lol.  Go see for yourself, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for dinner, at first I thought I wanted to turn around and leave, it looked very empty and the atmosphere just didnt appease my taste, but my husband insisted we try it since we absolutely love sushi and like to try new places. Once the food came, it was actually surprisingly fresh and tasted not bad, they even serve tequila there which you wont find in too many local sushi bars. I gave it 3 star because of the cold atmosphere, the lights were too bright, tables looked like i was eating at a lunch room, although the prices were clearly not that cheap. The owners were pretty nice as well, its a family business with the husband and wife working and maybe 1 other person. That place was ok but I definitely have had better!"}
{"text":"Not amazing but not bad . Got the caterpillar and captain crunch to go . Both were fine . But super small . Weren't very filling . It's fine if your in a hurry"}
{"text":"Wild Tunas is by far the best sushi in the Valley! Always extremely fresh and so delicious. The owner and staff are extremely friendly and attentive. I have been there many times and will keep going back. :)"}
{"text":"What a great find. A family owned and run business with great food. Here from Philadelphia and was looking for good sushi. Found it.   Knowledgeable and helpful. Fair prices!  I'll be back my next business trip to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant!  We love the food. The creative names for the specials like Fire in the Hole and Marilyn Monroll keep us coming back.  Excellent service every time we visit.  Love the design and decor of this cozy sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Try the uni in the winter months... Seared tuna is amazing... Everything from the wasabi to the ginger is super fresh and clean.  Well done!!!"}
{"text":"Wife is away so Dad and four kids do sushi. Seemed like a good plan and was.   We went to a place none of us had eaten at before. Oldest and number three chose the place. Not sure what won them over in comparison to other places, but it all worked out.  I thought the sushi was good. I liked the Spicy Tuna with the soy sauce marinade, as did number one. He said \"it was refreshing to have a spicy roll that was actually spicy and the soy sauce marinade for the spicy tuna was tasty.\" It was a good roll.  Number three really liked the Eel and Cucumber roll. She specifically said \"I thought the Sushi was amazing and the eal was not to dry and that all the fish was very tasty.\"  Number two, who can be picky with the sushi he eats, said \"Sushi was tasty. Big fan of the spicy tuna and eel, soy sauce was good for writing.\"   That is right, the soy sauce was good for writing. He lead the table in writing his name on his plate with soy sauce. I knew all of the studying in high school would pay off. Shows why he recently graduated. Asher, way to use your creative powers for good!  Now number four had some super interesting comments after our meal. He told me he would rate the restaurant 3-3.5 stars and he had reasons:  Reason Number. 1: the fish on the nigiri sushi was too thick. That's right, he would like some thinner sliced fish. Who knew?  Reason Number 2: there was not enough rice with the nigiri sushi because of how big the pieces of fish were. Yup. No joke.  Even though I respect his opinion, I didn't take it into consideration for the rating based on the reasons, which, while honest, completely hilarious and altogether awesome, didn't seem like good reasons to lower a rating.  So what we learned is if you want good size pieces of nigiri sushi this is a good place to go. I am sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Really fresh! The atmosphere is nice. Honestly, the smoked salmon nigiri was the best I've ever had. My tuna roll was also quite spectacular. Thumbs up to this place."}
{"text":"Cute little contemporary sushi bar tucked into an unassuming strip mall.   I'm not big into the sashimi part of the sushi world so I stick to the specialty rolls for the most part.    I enjoyed all the rolls I tasted about 6 or so.   The Rasta with spicy tuna was very good, Surf and Turf was different but good,  one with tempura chicken  was fine, soft shell crab was tasty and fun to look at with it's big legs and claws sticking out of the rolls.  I think they just opened a few weeks ago and don't have ordering system down  yet, they kept bring out several items that we didn't order.  Other than that this is a good place to drop in and get some good hassle free sushi."}
{"text":"Neighborhood sushi restaurant that is family owned. I have been here a handful of times and it is good but not great. Rolls are unique with fun names but a bit overpriced for what you get. I love yellowtail and it is always amazing here. Service is slow but I get it when it is just one person waiting on the whole place. The salads are great here as well. Owner is always nice and chatty when you come in. Overall good place to come when I dont feel like driving to my two favorite sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I come here as often as we can, really great sushi, nice environment, and very friendly staff. 100% Recommend. The sushi gives you superpowers. I fear that might get glossed over, so I'll mention it again. The sushi gives you superpowers. This is an insanely good deal for the money, as I'm pretty sure that science hasn't made these superpowers available to the public yet. I won't go into too much detail about the superpowers and what they entail, but you can imagine they're pretty great."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Monday night and received excellent service, high quality tasty food, and a surprisingly affordable bill. So glad to have these guys in  the hneighborhood."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi and a very relaxed environment. This is a must try hidden gem.   I ordered several roles and every single one seemed to taste better than the previous. The staff is very friendly and attentive. I see myself making this a regular spot of mine :)"}
{"text":"Had a girls night out, and decide to try this place because it was the only sushi place between my girlfriend and I. Very quaint little place, was happy they had a happy hour. I love the fact it is a local Mom and Pop. The edamame was yummy, they had cute different colored soy paper. Both the owners made sure we were enjoying ourselves and would stop by to chat. The sushi was enjoyable, not the best I've had, but good. My friend and I will be returning and hope it is just as good/better the next time."}
{"text":"I went on a week night so didn't have the issues some have had with service.  The place was dead.  I thought the sushi was ok, but it could have been better.  Prices were a bit steep compared to other places I have been.  2 sets of rolls and a beer was $30..  I could get more for less.."}
{"text":"Wow this place is great! Love how casual it is, and how friendly the staff is. Sushi was also obviously great, seeing as it's a 5 star review! The tuna nigiri was unbelievable! And we had the wild tuna roll and the Rhasta roll! Both were good, but I preferred the tuna one! They were pretty busy for a Friday night, but never overly full and the service was still on point. Tyler was very nice and never rushed us! Nice little gem! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to check this place out for Happy Hour on a Friday. The deals for HH are not great and the drink selection is very minimal. After having to flag down our server to ask questions after she tried to scurry away on us, we ordered 3 rolls between us. She brought us one tiny little saucer of wasabi and ginger. When we asked if we were going to get another one she said no. When we asked for more she asked if we wanted to pay extra for the \"real\" wasabi. No, we just would each like our own wasabi and ginger... she reluctantly brought us one more tiny dish. When I asked for a side of eel sauce-- Surprise! I was charged for it. When we asked for some more napkins, we each received one more. The sushi was fine, nothing to write home about, but the level of stinginess was kind of unreal. Based on this, our server's general attitude, and the lack of good Happy Hour prices, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I pretty much call everyone \"tuna\" so I had a feeling Wild Tuna would do me good.  And it did!  It's an obviously family owned joint and as the owner put it, he's \"a bit of a mad scientist\".  We tried 3 of the special rolls - all were great.  The presentation was awesome.  Especially the Salmon and Garfunkel - when they served it, \"fifty ways to leave your lover\" was playing in the background.... I was amused.  Our order came out one item at a time so we werent overwhelmed.  We spent $65 for two people before tip.  We sat at the bar and just, honestly, had a great time.  We aren't sashumi snobs - just wanted some decent sushi.  And this place hit the mark!  I want to go back and leave room for some sushi style dessert.  Tonight's special was the Elvis - peanut butter and banana in a spring roll, topped with chocolate sauce and whip cream.  Hope it's there when we go back!"}
{"text":"This place had great service and the sushi was great. The dynamite roll was so good. The 4 of us ate 6 diff rolls and we were stuffed and it was not expensive. Highly recommend this place. Intimate atmosphere and very clean inside. The sushi chef was very helpful and nice."}
{"text":"I went for the first time tonight, and I'm so glad I did. The owners are incredibly friendly. The fish was all fresh with great texture. My friend and I got four different rolls to try out and we weren't disappointed. You should absolutely give it a try!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big sushi fan. Have eaten it all over Phoenix and all over the world. This place is just ok. Fish did not taste especially fresh on our nigiri and the gyoza appetizer was kinda bland. Overpriced, compared to other (better) options.   I'm new to Moon Valley and hoped that this would be a great local place in our backyard. Guess I'll have to keep looking."}
{"text":"It's all about the Poke! They are open for lunch and serve some of the freshest Poke around during the week. Fresh fish, good choice of base ingredients, lots of sauces and other ingredients. Sushi is also very good and the friendly staff is second to none. Will be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and nice laid back atmosphere. Service was prompt and friendly.  Sushi was extremely fresh."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Unfortunately the place was empty except for one other person. But the atmosphere was nice and the owners were friendly and helpful. The food was great. I have found it quite difficult to find good sushi in Phoenix and this was the best so far. the fish was fresh & tender. We tried yellowtail, salmon & 2 different rolls. One with yellowtail, the other with shrimp. All were good and I would order again.  We will return for sure and would certainly recommend. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I know this is stated over and over again but... all I'm going to say is DYNAMITE ROLL! I have been coming by here for years as I live right down the street and If i crave sushi and have the extra spending money to afford it, I rarely go anywhere else. Added bonuses are that the owner and people who work there are really nice and attentive. Just an overall great place."}
{"text":"Always delicious!  The best yellowtail tuna in town. Run by a local family. I'm happy to support our locals. They recently started offering poke bowls at lunchtime. Don't miss out on this fresh lunchtime item!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been here many times over the past 3-4 years. We live just down the street and it is niceto have such a great sushi joint so close to home. It's a mom-pop type place and they take great pride in serving some the best sushi in town. We always order lots of sashimi...I'm getting hungry thinking about this!  I read previous reviews that their prices are high...I disagree.They are priced how they should be. You pay what you get for. You will pay the same at other really good sushi places. If you are in the area then you have to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the service was especially great! Super friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"How this place has any stars is 100% beyond me. I would give -5 stars if I could. My experience here last night was not only the worst sushi rolls that I've ever had, it was also the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. Both my boyfriend and I have over 10 yrs working in food service, we're not picky or looking for reasons to complain but food should be edible and service should be decent (or at least attempt to be). I love to support local business but this experience was beyond disappointing, a total waste of $34.   * 10 mins to acknowledge us, in a tiny room with 3 other tables already seated. Server finally came and was not even remotely polite. Just barked at us asking if we were ready.  * Waited 30 mins for our food, no one came by to check on us or let us know what was going on.  * When food finally came out server passed us to pick up dishes off an empty table with our food on a tray, when she could have easily served us and then dealt with the dirty table.    * The rolls were tiny, I mean so small we actually started laughing. Tasted like absolutely nothing.   * Surf and Turf -The steak should be sliced thin and seared. This was just fatty, disgusting lumps of raw meat. We ate them because we were starving, a move we would regret in about 30 mins...  * We wrote down our order for 1 Cali Roll, 1 Surf and Turf roll and a calamari appetizer on the menu they gave us. Rolls came out, we asked for our app. She says we didn't order one, I tell her we did. She continues to argue we didn't.  Fine, we order a different calamari app. She comes back and says that app is different than the one you ordered on the menu (the one SHE said we never ordered) we know this, can we just have some calamari for god's sake?   * Calamari eventually comes out looks like burnt panko cheese sticks and is literally rubber. I try as hard as I can to pull one apart and cannot.  We send it back as it's not even edible, not even a \"hey sorry about that \" nothing.   * Went home and immediately both me and my boyfriend run to separate bathrooms sick to our stomach, and I'm still nauseated today."}
{"text":"We just had the best experience. We were immediately greeted and explained the menu by Tyler. He took the time to make sure that we were satisfied with the food we ordered. We appreciate great customer and would recommend this place to ANYONE looking for great sushi and a personalized experience."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places I have been to for sushi. The owners are friendly, personable and welcoming to new comers. Every bit of sushi was amazing! The yellowtail sashimi = AMAZING!!!!!"}
