{"text":"You couldn't ask for a better location for a restaurant, right on the habour side with the most beautiful of views. One side is the harbour and the sea beyond and on the other Scarborough Castle. It is a beautiful place to eat on a summers night when everything is lit up.    The food is absolutley stunning and is definitly worth the price, it's not somewhere you could afford to go on a regular basis but is definilty the place to go for a treat.    Parking can be difficult but that is a general Scarbrough problem."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant, Clean with nice friendly staff and enjoyable food with a good childrens menu. Reasonably priced.    The Cheesecakes are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"One of the great things about this place is the position right on the sea front with views across the habour - stunning! I also like the open plan kitchen - I always feel more confident about the quality of the food when you can see it being cooked. This has a reasonably priced pizza and pasta menu, as you would expect in an Italian themed francise resturant, and a good kids menu. I have only been here for lunch out of season so they weren't very busy. The staff were great, friendly and happy to chat, the food was served quickly but you never felt rushed so a very pleasent dining experience."}
{"text":"Lovely location, large outdoor seating area and upstairs is a lovely view of the harbour. I have been several times and it's always been packed to the rafters. It does get very hot inside.i've never been offered a table outside or upstairs (the loos are upstairs, that's how I know about the view) It's a pleasant place to eat, very noisy when full and staff are rushed off their feet but are very efficient. The food is nicesome dishes on there that you don't find in a run of the mill italian restaurant. The portions aren't huge.we can easily eat the full 3 courses, which is unusual for me.most places I never can manage a dessert! On the whole a pleasant dining experience"}
