{"text":"this place is awesome! We travel to get there at least once a week.  anyone that wants a great meal for a great price. try it!!"}
{"text":"I'm perplexed on what to rate this. I've had such a bad experience with this establishment, that I've vowed I will not return.  The location is dirty first off.  They had a guy that was CLEARLY both Homeless and Intoxicated in the establishment. I don't care if he's ordering something to stay off the streets for a bit. As a paying patron of this restaurant, I shouldn't be exposed to such a horrible scene.  Went on a Friday Night. Not busy at all. One person in front of me.. But they were really unable to accommodate her as her order was simple. But took forever.  I did have someone else help me, but it felt like an ETERNITY to get my order.. and while I was waiting they got SWAMPED. I can see the Owners just look at each other in panic as more and more people billowed into the Restaurant.  The guy helping me tried to assist. While waiting for my Donair to cook, he asked everyone for their orders. Most people were getting a slice of Pizza, but he was unwilling to help them unless they were getting food that actually needed to be prepared.  Again, I've said with these types of Establishments - Don't ever get anything outside the Sweet Sauce on a Donair; I found their sauces Bland and Tasteless.  Overall.. the Donair was quite good - but was ruined by a horrible experience."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.   I've had and seen better, think it needs a re-do.  and this isn't the right phone number."}
{"text":"So, if you're like me, you love a good donair every now and then... okay not then, just now!  It doesn't matter where I am or what I'm doing, I can always eat a good donair and, my goodness, does Great Canadian Shawarma know how to make a good one.  Not only are their donairs and shawarmas stuffed with so much meat and veggies you can barely get your mouth around it, but they load on the delicious sauce to make it a mouth-watering, no time for breathing, must eat as fast as possible to avoid someone snaking a bite, yummy treat.  That being said, they don't charge out the butt for these things either.  It's surprising that the amount of food you get comes at a very reasonable cost.  To make it worth my while I usually get a medium (or large if I'm feeling saucy) so I can possibly save some for later.  The only problem with Great Canadian is that it can get a little busy during the weekday lunchtime hours.  Since it's downtown, and right near a train station, people line-up to have a taste of heaven.  I prefer going on either the weekend or in the afternoon when it's not as busy and I can get my fix as fast as possible!"}
