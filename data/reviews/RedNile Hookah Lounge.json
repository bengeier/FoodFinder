{"text":"This was our first time here. We ordered 1 flavour - double apple - the sheesha was not made right so we told the hostess to switch and get us a different flavour ... the sheesha was even worse than the last time. The tea was cold as ice. The staff if really friendly but the sheesha is shit. Don't even want to try the food here.   Ps. The sheesha was broken and our table was wobbly. Not even worth 1 star."}
{"text":"There are very few places in the GTA that actually manage to get a hookah right. And this place definitely got it right. The quality of the hookah and the flavours are definitely there. The two owners great every one that comes in which gave me the feeling that I've been a regular for years! The food selection is also better than what I expected!"}
{"text":"Great place. Great atmosphere. Good service ,Love the giant tea pot .reasonable prices.  Will come back"}
{"text":"Out of all the hookah places I've been to rednile hands down is the best place I've been too. Everything is so clean & the atmosphere & service is amazing no complaints id probably say this is the best spot for shisha yet."}
