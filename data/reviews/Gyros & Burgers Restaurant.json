{"text":"I called to place a pickup order and was hung up on. I should have known this would be the case after looking at their website: http://gyrosandburgersrestaurant.com/ WOW!"}
{"text":"Look I like a little Greek once in a while they owner seemed friendly until I ask about my order his attitude was \"it is what it is.\"  I ordered the Shish Kebab Platter, I got my order in a fair amount of time but there were no vegetables except one small piece of tomato. I asked him about the picture and said where are all the other items, he said that picture on the advertisement is from the internet its not what i'm selling....I will find my wife Gyros some where else."}
{"text":"where do I start with this place ?
 OK they made our drinks and then didn't give them to us just let them sit on the counter while it took 25 min for our order. Oh and the girl put coffee cup lids on our drinks. 
They skimp on things where they can .
 A quarter of a pickle just thrown in your food? Not even a full pickle spear?.  Do not get the tazekie sauce it's way watered down!!I
 The French fries were good after ya heated them up in the microwave.   They said they have a Italian sausage sandwich but it's not a sandwich they give you its just a polish sausage on a hot dog bun.
The cheeseburger they offer is a frozen patty Qt burger with skimpy dressings on it."}
{"text":"Gyros are awesome. Everyone is very friendly and place is clean. 

Update almost one year later is still same great quality and still 5 stars."}
{"text":"I always get excited for mom & pop gyro shops, so it sucks extra hard when I am occasionally let down by them. I mean, the people are nice and all, but the food blows. No, I don't mean that as in it was simply disappointed, I mean that as in this could literally be the worst Mediterranean  I've ever had. 

Where do I start? 

OK, I was surprised with the generous portion of hummus. The little to-go box was heavy as a brick! Too bad there was an excessive pool of sesame oil on top that was already leaking out of the styrofoam when it was handed to me. Even worse, the hummus was quite bland and suspiciously bitter. Like...how do you mess up something this simple? I think the most horrifying part was that for what had to be at least a half pound of hummus, there was one tiny little serving of pita bread. Like, take a little 5\" circle of it that you would buy from the store, heat it up, and then cut it in half. That's how much you get. Seriously, WTF man? I would have paid extra for at least a full serving of bread.

The gyro is arguably the worst I've had. It's on par with college cafeterias and places that totally don't specialize in them. This is supposed to be the main attraction. This is SUPPOSED to be the best item offered. It's terrible. As another reviewer pointed out, the tzatziki sauce tastes watered down. And there's barely any of it. And while there was ample meat, it was not only incredibly bland (you don't have to just prepare it as-is, you're supposed to add your own touch), but so mushy I was concerned with whether or not it had been cooked adequately. The fries are so forgettable I can't even comment on them. Their desserts are store-bought, and their fountain drinks are kool-aid...which is the only thing I enjoyed from my visit here. Black cherry for the win.

I usually reserve one-star reviews for some combination of bad food AND bad service, but this place is so terrible at doing basic meals, that I wonder if only a lack of competition keeps them afloat. If someone brings you lunch from this place, assume you did something to piss them off."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! We have been all over town over the years for gyros and this place is the best. And the prices makes it all the better. A Gyro feast that says it feeds 6 easily feeds my family of 9 and only for $17.99!! The staff is always very kind and fast. An unexpected gem here in Glendale. Keep up the great work. Many Blessings to you all."}
