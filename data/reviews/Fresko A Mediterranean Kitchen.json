{"text":"Great food , it was the first for us i order greek hamburger, gyro and sales very delicious and fresh ,very nice design for small space .I'll go back again"}
{"text":"Fresko's was great! The food was delicious and the service was wonderful. We stopped here on chance because it was close to our hotel and we will come back anytime we're in Phoenix! Try the Greek burger!"}
{"text":"Perfection! I had been wanting to come here for a while, and I'm So glad I did!! I had the gyro pita--the pita was fresh, soft, and warm, and the gyro meet was perfectly cooked. I also had a side of greek fries. I'm Super picky with fries, and these were Perfect. Nice and crunchy and well-seasoned. The customer service was also outstanding. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! If you Lillie Mediterranean food, then you will love this place! All homemade recipes and fresh ingredients! Owners are wonderful and staff is extremely friendly!! A must try!!!"}
{"text":"Quick, Easy, Healthy & Local. Perfect answer to the question, I don't want to cook tonight, but I don't want to get all dolled up to go out. Not to mention, they are BYOB with no corkage fee"}
{"text":"We dined with Gina today here for lunch. I've had a it of Greek food, and Fresko has stood out as having very good quality ingredients and tasty dishes. I had the gyro plate with the cucumber salad. It was great and portions were in line with my diet goals. Healthy, tasty, and friendly. Go there."}
{"text":"They had me at \"natural chicken\". The green beans and rice were so good I ordered second helpings. Thanks Fresco for offering healthy options."}
{"text":"I love Greek and Mediterranean food.  Yesterday, I saw Fresko Mediterranean, read the reviews, and looked forward to trying the food.  I ordered chicken and lamb kabbob meals, Greek and Tabouli salads, and sides.  Bar none, this was the worst food (in general) I have eaten in many years.  The kabbobs, salads, and sides were bland. The fries were ok.  The seasonings tasted as if they came from cheap seasoning packets from the local store. And the food was priced high, even for good quality food for this type of restaurant.  Maybe it was a bad day; or Fresko is trying \"very hard\" to go out of business.  Either way, I know that I will never eat at Fresko's again."}
{"text":"I stoped in on Sunday morning. It was empty at first but people started to come in for the lunch rush. I had the Greek Burger which was a very flavorful pita / burger fusion. We also got the sampler platter and all of their dips are made in house and were wonderful."}
{"text":"Very fresh, obviously cooked to order, loved the gyros, salad, fries and meatballs. Quick, friendly service, and fair prices. BYOB."}
{"text":"Super fresh through and through, and not to mention tasty! Their baba ganoush is amazing too. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a new restaurant coming to our little neighborhood, especially Mediterranean! I frequently go to its older competitor down the street so I thought the fair thing to do was get the same meal I get at the other place: standard gyro and greek fries. The flavor was pretty good, but the meal was pricier here and the meat was very greasy. I will definitely go again and try something else. Maybe they excel at one of the other meals? But for just a standard gyro, I'm sticking with their neighbor."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch last week at Fresko's!! The staff was extremely friendly. It is a small space but with all 7 of us eating together, they gladly put tables together for us and made sure we had everything we needed. The food is superb! The appetizers, falafel, and baklava we're so delicious! And don't forget about their cold brew coffee! I will definitely be coming back and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Mediterranean food and great service!"}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of chicken souvlaki before and this place ranks up there as one of the best. The chicken was very moist and seasoned just right. The pita sandwich was a good size and they didn't hold back on the Tzatziki sauce either. Look foward to coming back to try more."}
{"text":"Visited Fresko Mediterranean Kitchen on opening day and it was more than one could hope for. Hummus, Baba Ganoush, and Pita bread are fresh and delicious. The Gyro and House Baklava are the best I have ever tasted. Not making that up. I tried them all over the US and will drive anywhere for great Gyros and Baklava. This is the place. Order them with Lemonada. Like lemonade with magic added. Trust your taste buds. They will kindly thank you after a visit to Fresko."}
{"text":"A great little gem. Fabulous food and friendly owner and employees. Also, a very good value for the money. With the plates you get a main dish, fresh baked bread, and two sides. Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Very Tasty and fresh! Calling all Tzatiki Lovers. Friendly service. All Fresh made and yummy! Great Service. They are BYOB with no uncorking charge"}
{"text":"Great food. We got the appetizer and with plenty of dip and yummy falafel. As well as veggies . Would just say more pita bread because it was so yummy !!!"}
{"text":"We chose Fresko to cater our holiday lunch party because we were looking for something different.   Everything was amazing, especially the Spanakopita, Moussaka, the fresh pita bread and the dip sampler, just to name a few. Trust me, there is so much more to choose from. Would have loved to get one of everything!  Janna and Kody definitely exceeded our expectations in preparing an authentic and delectable variety of healthy and fresh Mediterranean foods! We'll be visiting again for sure!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! Very fresh and healthy. Wonderful vegetarian options. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! This is what happens when two seasoned professionals come together to offer incredible Mediterranean cuisine.  Kody is an extraordinary chef with a phenomenal culinary background and Janna manages the restaurant with finesse and much care. Their collaboration produces wonderful gourmet food in ambiance of relaxation.     The Ahwatukee Foothills is very fortunate to have such a wonderful eatery that offers the freshest, the finest, and the most fabulous in Mediterranean!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place by word-of-mouth.  I never noticed it from the street.  All I can say is WOW!  Delicious Greek food!  I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki and it was fabulous!  The homemade pita was unbelievably tasty and the chicken was wonderful.  Service was excellent.  Greek fries were just OK.  I've ordered greek fries at other restaurants and am used to getting them with a little lemon olive oil drizzled over french fries with some feta cheese crumbled over the top.  Fresko's were just french fries with chunks of feta. I think they could work on those.  But, I will be back! Excellent food!!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! The atmosphere is casual and cute- very much the cafe ambience. I had the gyro with Greek fries and I was really impressed. Hefty portions of meat, tzatziki and feta on the gyro and also you could tell the tomatoes and onions were chopped fresh- both were crisp and chunky which added an awesome fresh taste to the cheese, yoghurt and meat on the pita. If you like crispy fries, you will NOT be disappointed- the fries were perfect and seasoned very well. And a new selection of unsweetened teas? Basically this has my name written all over it.  This is all I could be looking for in a cafe restaurant, but the fact that it's owned locally makes me 100 times happier to spend my money there. You will be so happy you tried this place!"}
{"text":"Adore this place! The pita bread and hummus are to die for! You will not be let down with this appetizer. You might just find yourself ordering more. The Greek side salad is also a favorite. Staff are nice and this place is always busy!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always fresh! I've never really like Greek food but I thought I'd give this place a chance after my friend referred me here. I work around the corner I wanted to try something new so I did and I freaking love this place."}
{"text":"Plain and simple... This place is just that. Not fancy, just excellent Mediterranean fare. The staff is friendly and accomodating and the dishes are exactly what one would expect from this type of establishment yet there are subtle creative twists in every offering. For the love of food, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Tried Fresko a little while ago for an impromptu lunch. It was just ok. Cute place. Little pricy for lunch - they have no lunch menu or specials.  We asked. It's the same menu as the dinner menu. My chicken Souvlaki was $7 and husband's lamb $9. Sides were extra, $2 for regular fries and $3 for Greek. You could tell the fries were recooked. :( The chicken was good but my (Mediterranean) husband did not like the lamb at all and the portion was quite small. I might give it another chance but my husband said he would not go back. The chicken was good, but not the lamb. We didn't try the hummus or anything else, just a couple of sandwiches and fries."}
{"text":"There's a lot of Greek and Mediterranean places within a few miles, and this is by far the most fresh and delicious one. The staff is super friendly. The spinach pasta salad and souvlaki chicken are my go-to."}
{"text":"I've visited this nifty place 3 times since their opening. Everything I've tried has been delicious! . Had 1 little blip with the cucumber salad but they made it right immediately and cheerfully. I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"I had seen the place as new and was on my list of places to check out It was not anything special to me I come from NY CT and have had much better Counter service and small portions Feta seemed store bought nothing like fresh homemade I was used to"}
{"text":"This review is based on one visit and one food item.   Fresko A Mediterranean Kitchen is located on the same shopping center as my  ew gym. After taking a quick tour of the gym I walked over to Fresko to grab lunch. I did not Yelp this restaurant before dining in.   I ordered a Chicken Souvlaki Pita, no side, no drink. My total was $7 and some change (I can't remember the exact total). I decided to get my food to go. I waited a little while for my food to be prepared. A really kind woman (the Owner or manager think) was running the food out and realized I was sitting there empty handed for a while and asked me for my order again. A few minutes later she came back with it. A very small sandwich in a small bag.   I didn't open it up until I got back to my office (less than 10 mins away). I was highly disappointed when I did. It was the smallest pita I've ever had. Totally diffident then anything else I've had in Arizona. The flavor was excellent, seasoned perfectly but it was so small. I'm still hungry now!!  This was my first time having a pita that I could hold with one hand, needing no assistance at all from the other hand. In fact, I could roll my pita up and eat it. Picture that, I ate it like a chicken pita roll up or something. Yes. It was that small. It had 7 small chunks of chicken on it. I counted and enclosed a picture for you to count too! If I were dining in I would have sent it back and ordered something else, something more filling.   I do plan to check them out again. I noticed a sign for a BYOB policy with no cork fee. I like that. Free WiFi, I like that too and again, it's located a few doors down from my gym so I'm sure I'll try the food again. I will not however bother ordering the chicken pita again. It really isn't worth it."}
{"text":"A truelly joyful experience. Everyone is so nice and friendly, the environment is comfortable and welcoming you clean. Then the food knocks it out of the park. You can taste how fresh and clean everything is. A relief for some like myself who works a long of a day.  It would be a shame to miss out on them, they deserve a chance.  Loved the chicken souvlaki"}
{"text":"The service is good here, they welcome you with a smile and the food is fresh and tasty. Looks like its very clean this place. Recommended for Falafel lovers and mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I came here for a weekday lunch and loved it. It's a small store in a quiet strip mall. The inside is clean and pleasant and the service is great.   I had the meatball pita with a cucumber salad and iced green tea. I ate every bite!  My friend had a the soup with a tabouli salad. She enjoyed hers as well, but said she probably would try something different the next time we come here. We are looking forward to coming again and trying some of the other menu items.   After reading the other reviews, I will probably give their dinner options a try. They offer both Middle Eastern and Greek dishes that sound fabulous."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try this place as I love Mediterranean food and there are many good reviews online.  I didn't care for the hummus,  too garlicky and I prefer smooth hummus texture over their chunkier hummus. The prices are a little high.  I got a gyro, which was good."}
{"text":"Great food made with fresh ingredients. The staff was also very friendly and attentive. Bonus: Right now, they are offering a special when you check in on social media and show your phone to an employee you get a free dessert. First  time stopping in for lunch, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I wasn't very hungry but I wanted to try this place. I got the hummus that comes with one pita bread. My boyfriend got the Gyro sandwich. Let me tell you I'm a huge fan of bread and this pita bread is to die for. I could really eat it with everything. My boyfriend devoured his sandwich. It was the perfect amount of tzatziki to gyro. We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"About a year ago I came to your restaurant with a friend who lives near Fresko.  I had, among other things, the Spanakopita which was HEAVEN!  All the food we had was great.  A few weeks ago I went back with the same friend and had the Spanakopita and the meatballs.  Both were horrible and I was so disappointed!   I will not be going back.  My friend said the food has gone downhill since you opened when it was so wonderful, and that is certainly the experience I had."}
{"text":"Just got home from having lunch at Freskos. Had the chicken salad pita. The chicken salad was absolutely the best and the pita bread was soft with a bit of crunchiness on the outside. The owner and young man who waited on us were very friendly. Uses her family recipes. Will definitely frequent this restaurant often. A great addition to Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Great Food!! Fresh and Delicious. We will definitely be back! Very friendly staff. Definitely a gem!"}
{"text":"Happened to hear about this quaint little Mediterranean/Greek restaurant from the Ahwatukee Friends group, so thought we'd check it out. What a pleasant surprise!  The tabouli, baba ghanouj, and hummus combination was fabulous! Their pita bread is freshly baked. Don't miss out on the baklava!  Cody and Janna (co owners) are welcoming and super friendly. Stop by and meet them next time you're in The Tuke!"}
{"text":"Fresko's fresh and healthy food is amazing.  We hired them to cater a shower with over 35 guests and they did an outstanding job!  Both owners were extremely helpful and Janna did a fabulous job with respect to timely delivery and setup.  Everyone loved the food!  The only suggestion that I could pass along is that you should definitely order extra food, because your guests will be going back for seconds!!!  To the Fresko's team.....Thank you for everything!"}
{"text":"Excelente comida griega. Atención personalizada. ideal para después de una visita a IKEA. El lugar es pequeño pero eso no tiene porqué ser algo malo"}
{"text":"Fresh and light salads. Chicken Souvlaki is awesome on a pita or on a salad. If you want drunk/hangover gyros go to the place on 48th st. If you want healthy, flavorful Med food you can't go wrong  here. Very convenient takeout!"}
{"text":"Used trusty yelp to find this little gem before heading to airport .Hubby and I shared the lamb souvlaki meal and moussaka .All were delicious! Only negative I would say is that Greek fries were cold ( don't think they are meant to be cold ??) and moussaka was just warm but the authentic Greek flavours were in the mark ....would definitely search them out again Ina future trip to Phoenix :)"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Fresh Greek Food with exceptional service. Love this little taste of Greece in our neighborhood.."}
{"text":"Yea!!! Finally an exceptional Mediterranean restaurant in Ahwatukee! Best tzatziki I've ever had! Everything is truly fresh and house made. Lamb, spanakopita, avgolemono soup, bougatsa dessert....all so good! Also have to mention that the  service is totally welcoming and kind. This is going to be on my regular rotation!"}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite food in Ahwatukee. I appreciate the quality of their food. Mediterranean food is full of taste, and there's was too! I look forward to trying more items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Awesome little hidden gem. Quality fresh salads and amazing gyros. Awesome top notch customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while we were in the area. So glad we did! I had the gyro, my husband had the lamb pita. Food was made fresh and excellent!"}
{"text":"Tried many times now and consistently amazing. Obsessed with the food and love the customer service."}
{"text":"Best falafel I ever had. They were very friendly and grateful for my business. The atmosphere was laid back and tasteful. Glad I found my new falafel spot!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive, tasty, and and a nice atmosphere. The service was great, and the desserts were awesome."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for a late lunch. I ordered the Spanakopita and the Greek salad. Very good. Wish the piece of Spanakopita was bigger. I wanted more! We also ordered the Greek fries, they are a treat. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star is because our waitress forgot my friends coffee. We reminded her twice and still forgot. There were only a few people having lunch so it wasn't tremendously busy. Finally she got her coffee when we were getting ready to leave. Overall a cute restaurant with good food. I will return..."}
{"text":"This is the best GREEK food I have had since moving to Phoenix 18 years ago!!! I am from Chicago and have some the best GREEK food around! Reasonably priced , friendly great staff and a terrific BYOB policy! Don't pass this place up!!!"}
{"text":"This place has more unique items on their menu compared to your typical Mediterranean restaurant. Everything was really fresh and tasty. The feta dip and mango black iced tea were great! Service was great, too."}
{"text":"This place has gone down of late.  The once terrific lemon soup is now a thick gravy-like consistency and no lemony flavor; it appears to have been put through a blender.  The babaganoush is the texture of mortar and bland.  The bean salad had undercooked beans. The dolmas were good and the bogatsa for dessert was the best part of our meal."}
{"text":"I have just a small handful of fav Mediterranean restaurants and Fresko just joined it. The clientele actually was as healthy as the dishes, as hikers swung in from local trailheads.  I had a white bean salad, a small order of hummus and baklava. The option for chicken with the salad was appreciated and the meat was well seasoned. The salad was a very good value with plenty for an evening leftover.   Alas, there were not leftovers of the hummus and baklava! Plating was quite beautiful and service was excellent."}
{"text":"This is absolutely wonderful and real Greek food.  I have tried the moussaka and their lamb! Wonderful.  Lemonade - best I've had.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is a sleeper in Ahwatukee, AZ. I was surprised by the very authentic and tasty Mediterranean food available. Everything is fresh and prepared with care. I'm not a food snob.  I just know what I like. This restaurant is going to be part of my routine visits to Phoenix."}
{"text":"We're talking 5 stars all the way here. To the point to where if you don't love Fresko, you simply can't be impressed. I mean that. You give 4 stars here, and your eating privileges are being taken away. I ordered the chicken souvlaki pita, greek fries, and mango black iced tea with lemon. The texture, flavor, and look of everything was like eating something out of a cooking magazine. The edges of the pita were perfectly browned like it was kissed by God. It was delightful, and I don't use that word frequently. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant.  Unfortunately, Fresko has ruined Greek/Mediterranean food for me for life. Because now I'll never be able to eat one of those Kronos Gyros pitas garbage again. My brain will always be comparing my experience to this one. It'd be like going back to banging a 7 when you were dating a 10.  Order the iced tea. It's popping with flavor, and you get their little eyeball/olive ice cubes with it. The baklava also looks heavenly.  This place has a lot of potential. I can spot a diamond in the rough, and this is one of them. The ownership ought to find a way to take on some non-sharky investment, someone who wants to grow with the company, so they can expand within the area. Whoever is cooking this food is a chef, not a cook. Again, delightful."}
{"text":"Update...the owner reached out and offered to comp my next meal....even though I didn't like the meatball sandwich, I did like the chicken souvlaki plate...I do appreciate the owner protecting her business by reaching out and fixing my experience...I'll be back in the future  Giving a 3 because I ate there many months back and the chicken pita was great....Today I ordered the meatball sub and tossed it out...the meatballs were undercooked and I really didn't like the taste at all...I ended up eating out of the company vending machine. Will wait a while before I give them another shot."}
{"text":"What a gem!  I've now tried Fresko twice and I would definitely return.  Don't want to wait for a table at the big popular restaurants in the area? Not a problem here.  Most people don't know about this place and you will not have to wait to order or to receive your food.  Not only that, Fresko's prices are competitive.  I highly recommend the hummus; it's the best I've ever had.  We will order it every time we visit.  My dinner date loves their Greek salad with chicken and he's ordered it both times.  He said the salad was very fresh and probably the best Greek salad he's had.  I've had the meatball meal and lamb pita.  The meatball plate included really tasty sides and the meatballs themselves were very tasty and fell apart in my mouth (not like thick Italian meatballs!).  I will probably try a few more items at this restaurant.  I really like the friendliness of the staff and the owner is there working!  This is the best kind of local restaurant."}
{"text":"Never been here before but it was near my hotel and I was starving so I decided to give it a try. The woman behind the counter was very nice. I ordered a chicken wrap to go.  When I took a bite into the wrap I felt a piece of chicken that was very hard, not sure if it was raw or over cooked. About 30 min later I felt sick to my stomach . Won't return again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, of course cozy atmosphere. Got an order to go and when we got home, literally only 1/2 of our order was in the bag. Yes we checked our itemized receipt. Total was over $40 and I even tipped."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in on a Sunday afternoon after reading some reviews on Yelp. The atmosphere was cozy with good music in the background.  I tried the chicken and my wife the gyro platter. Both were excellent! The gyro meat may have been the best I have ever had.  We both recommend this place and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Ok, so, yeah!!! Awesome! First of all, EVERYONE THAT WORKS HERE IS AWESOME!! Second, the food is amazing. Honestly the best falafel I have ever had... my son and I both had the falafel pita. I was going to take a picture and post it.. but I took one bite and forgot.. my wife had the chicken souvlaki pita, also awesome! Don't miss this place!!"}
{"text":"So if you don't know what bougatsa is, you have to try it--this is the only place in town where you can get it. if you're like me and love bougatsa, you'll love theirs. Don't buy it all--save some for me."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and we were not disappointed! Had the Meze platter and the Pastitsio. Both delicious. A lot of food for 2 people...could not eat it all. Nice atmosphere and great service! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Gyro meat from a frozen loaf, rather than a traditional cone. You could do much better at several other local shops.   Meat balls that were apparently prepared earlier and held long before ordering. Ending up dry and visually unappealing.   French fries that were not prepared per order and held to long. The topping of feta added little to a barely warm fry.  They had no business being on our plates.   Rice was over cooked, lacking flavor and barely warm.   \"Country Bread \" seemed like a strange choice to accompany our order.   Marinated salad was flavorful, but components had sat too long. Very soft consistency.   We felt that very little of our meal was prepared for us, rather warmed up and served.   Staff was very nice and appreciative of our visit.  We had high hopes, wanting to support a new local business, but left disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow! Fresh, clean, cooked to order, and FLAVORFUL! So glad I stumbled on this place- my new go-to spot."}
{"text":"This is actually closer to a 3.5 star but don't take that the wrong way as I am kinda stingy with 4 star reviews (but giving 4-star as they are new in town). This place had fast friendly service. The food was hot and pretty darn yum. And the restaurant was clean. I had the chicken souvlaki with a side of tabbouleh and Greek fries. A really decent grab n go option and nice to have another local option in Ahwatukee. I will be back for a second go around."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, healthy options. Nice decor. Not your typical fast food Greek place."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. The potato salad is great as is the chicken meal. Very tasty. My daughter had French fries and they tasted really good - like they were baked and had great flavor.   Service was terrific and the cook came out and took the time to explain the differences between their desserts. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the gyro plate with potato salad and fries  Came with about 4 pieces of gyro meat about half this thickness of a piece of cheese and was the frozen kind   this was more of a snack than a dinner. wont visit again, competition gives you way more portions and charges less"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Chicken souvlaki pita is awesome! Gyro meet is seasoned just right and so tender whether in a pita or just the plate version.   The hummus is going to be a denser, grittier version than what you are probably used to but still good. Baklava is excellent also and they give a large portion.   Greek fries delicious too.  I had been here 5 times and haven't had a bad meal yet. Highly recommend!  I've now had the gyro plate (excellent), cucumber salad is perfect (nice and light), and their green tea is fantastic.   Small local business whose owners are on site (always) and engaging with everyone.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh food. The service was excellent. Nice, casual, inexpensive place. Dog friendly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love their food! Best pita & gyro I've ever had and a reasonable price. Service - friendly & quick. If you want Greek food - go here"}
{"text":"On recommendation from Y-friend Karen W. came in to try Fresko. Super thrilled I listened, this time. Small restaurant, big on flavor and homestyle friendly service. Lots of local regulars immediately began conversation with us, enthusiastically promoting the \"freshness\" of all dishes.  A BiG Plus is... You can BYOB!! Yea!!  Greek food is a longtime favorite and moussaka was a definite must. Noticed Plates come with 2 sides and wanted to try a bit of a lot Therefore ordered:  1 Moussaka plate w/potato salad & cucumber salad 1 Gyro plate with green beans & tabouli 1 Chicken Souvlaki plate with Greek fries & cucumber salad What a Greek Feast Fest! Delicious with excellent size portions and fair pricing. We could not decide which were favorites as all were amazing! Please see photos and hopefully they tell the tale of an epic restaurant. We will return as other menu items caught our \"big eyes\" @@ Thanks to Miss Gina helping us with our orders and questions!  Plenty of parking without issue!"}
{"text":"Great place, clean, friendly and great food. A nice lunch place or for a quick dinner pick up! Baklava is really good not overly sweet more in the spice side which I like."}
{"text":"Just tried this place out yesterday and I already came back today! This place is amazing. They have lots of vegetarian options and the employees are helpful about answering questions and are so friendly! The costumer service is awesome. I love their dolmades and their falafel pita. Their falafel is the best I've ever tried, it's not dry or overly cooked it's perfect and their pitas are fresh and warm. 10/10 would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"After a long day of errands/Christmas shopping I was starving and wanted something fresh and healthy so I picked up dinner on the way home. Love this place as it's always delicious with the friendliest staff around. Moussaka/Rice Pilaf and Green beans were still steaming when I opened the box when I got home. Yum! Rice pudding for dessert which is amazing! Highly recommend this place for any of their items which I've had (that's most of the menu at this point)"}
{"text":"Too expensive for the serving size. Food was good, but not enough for what I paid. Also, the teen who took our order did not greet us. We had never been there before, we were not asked had we been there, if we needed any help with our decision. Nothing, I guess I expect too much. The customers were more informative than the folks that work there."}
{"text":"Wow!! So glad we stopped in. My FALAFEL PITA ($6) was the best I've ever had! I'm a HUGE falafel fan and have had it at dozens of places. Balls moist, not oily, perfect size, nicely spiced, and way more then I usually get in a pita. Also, Pita bread was AMAZING. Will visit again soon!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Phoenix visiting family from Dallas, Tx. I stumbled on this place as we drove to our destination. I yelped this place along with another Mediterranean restaurants. I chose Fresko because they had more Gluten-free items as I am sensitive to Wheat. I must say, it was the best decision. Why? The Greek salad for starters was sooo delicious, it was balanced with perfection. It had crunch, the right amount of salty-ness from the cheese and it was seasoned and dressed as a true Greek salad should. Moving along... the falafels were heavenly, they crispy and perfectly browned on the outside, but soft in the middle as a falafel should be. I'm a potato lover and I enjoy the taste of fries. The Greek fries will not disappoint! The green beans, yum! These are not your momma's green beans. They are Just as good or even better than soul food green beans. Finger licking good. The Chicken, seasoned perfectly, juicy and healthy, what more can you ask for. My 13 year old nephew had the GYRO and he ate every single morsel. There was nothing left on his plate. You will not be disappointed with the quality of the food, the staff and service. It's all Freaking amazing! Awesomely good. I Wish they were In Texas!! The best of the best! I'm Looking forward to another trip to Phoenix for a plate at Fresko."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and great tasting...  Not to mention it's a small business..."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mediterranean food! Owners are great people and have done a great job with the new place. Definitely will be coming back for the Chicken Pita and try some other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Super cute little place with good Mediterranean food. Reminds me of being in the Mid East definitely want to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food and service at this unpretentious and cozy restaurant. The chicken souvlaki pita and the Greek fries are amazing! Being from the East Coast, we also appreciate that there is NO CORKING FEE!!! So nice to bring our own wine and not get charged any extra. The house baklava is also a must try!"}
{"text":"Nice and Cozy Mediterranean place . Good tasting food .  It has its own taste and doesn't feel like eating at a chain restaurant . Very unique"}
{"text":"It's a cross between fast food and sit down.  You order at the counter and they bring everything to you a long with cleaning up after you there isn't even a trash can in the dining area.  The staff is friendly and helpful with the menu.  We got the sampler platter and the tastes were all over the place.  A little sweet, some spicy and some tangy. The meatballs are great expect don't try and bite them in half cause they will fall apart. Over all food fresh and everything I had I would eat again.  Oh and the music is a good choice"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new restaurant in our community and it did not disappoint! The food was fresh, hot, and delicious. Menu had great choices but not overwhelming. Ambience was clean and nicely decorated. Very friendly gentleman working the front counter who suggested the side of braised green beans with my chicken souvlaki plate and I was very happy with the selection. The chicken had great seasoning and very tender meat on the skewer. The cucumber salad was crunchy and fresh with right amount of dressing. The most unexpected delight was the bread and tzatziki which was more than just bread and sauce, you'll just have to try for yourself. (Almost didn't try it as I'm trying to cut carbs but worth the bites!) My son ordered chicken souvlaki on a pita with Greek fries and loved his meal. Said he was stuffed which is a big compliment! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Food was great which is hard to do a Greek restaurant. Dining area could use a little work but otherwise food came quick and hot and staff was friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Had a stellar horiatiki salad with chicken and wow!  I've been looking for my Greek restaurant since moving from Buffalo, New York and I haven't found a place until now!  The salad was extremely fresh (all house made) and the chicken was covered in super tasty spices.  The lady at the counter was such a sweetheart and very friendly.  I will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Food is good and the prices are great. Super friendly staff and very clean restaurant. The unsweetened mango ice tea is the bomb.   They are dog friendly and allow you to BYOB without a corking fee! HECK YA!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. I was in Tempe was super hungry and I was searching local places for gyros and I came across this place saw the good reviews and decided let's do it. I had for the first time a Greek burger in a pita bread that came with melted feta on top soooo freaking yummy. I cut my burger in half so it fit in the pita long ways and had a side order of the creek fries also soo good. Everything was delicious. Their all about healthy and fresh have a wall for how the restaurant started and history eating inside and out. It's perfect for all us gyros lovers. Deff coming back again."}
{"text":"Fresko is a cute little Mediterranean eatery owned by chef Kody Harris, who used to be the executive chef at Thirsty Lion Gastropub. Fresko means fresh in Greek, and the name holds true as their food is fresh, fast, and a healthier option for eating out.   I love how the menu offers items such as moussaka and pastitsio which can be hard to find at Greek restaurants here. I love both but I felt like eating more veggies than pasta so I went with the moussaka ($12.50). The plate comes with 2 sides, I had the Greek lentil soup (Fakes), and green beans. I also had a bite of the gyro sandwich.   Both were ready in a few short minutes. The moussaka was a generous plate, filled with a large square of the eggplant casserole, cup of soup, and hearty portion of green beans. The lentil soup was well seasoned and had a homey feel to it, while the green beans were stewed for a long time and had a tomato base. They were also nicely seasoned. I enjoyed the moussaka for the most part, with all the ingredients meshing well together, but as I ate more of it I noticed the center of was cold. Since they make it ahead of time and refrigerate it, more cooking time in the oven would help to ensure the entire portion of moussaka is heated up.   The sandwich was enjoyable, with its tender gyro meat, soft fluffy pita, fresh veggies and tzatziki sauce.  Service was friendly and sweet.   I love supporting independently owned businesses, especially ones owned by women! Overall it was a good experience and I'd go back again to try more off their menu."}
{"text":"I haven't had a falafel in Phoenix anywhere near as good as this in the 14 years I've lived here. I can't wait to come back to try the other menu items, especially the spanakopita. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! If you are looking for fresh healthy food that has amazing flavor, look no further. I have been hearing how wonderful this place was for months and today was my first experience. I will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Good size chicken sandwich gyro. Good amount of food stuffed into the sandwich and good flavoring on the gyro. Thought it was worth the money."}
{"text":"Happy to stumble upon this little gem. Wanted a healthier option (i.e. avoiding drive thrus) and it needed to be quick, thank you Yelp for guiding me here. Not only were they quick but service was great, the staff was friendlyand helpful in making my selection. I tried the Lamb Gyro, it smelled so good I couldn't wait to dig in. It was simple, perfectly seasoned, tender meat, feta, fresh, crisp tomatoes, some fresh red orion, Greek yogurt sauce all wrapped in a crisp, warm soft pita bread. A well balanced Grecian party in my mouth. Each bite was better than the last."}
{"text":"Great food and near our hotel. We ordered two gyro plates and a Greek salad to go. The plates were good but strange that country bread is included but not the traditional pita bread. My only complaints were that it was boiling hot inside the restaurant (that's why we got it to go) and the lady taking our order didn't seem to be very enthusiastic and wasn't very focused on what we wanted. Luckily the chef came out and fixed our order and included the pita bread."}
{"text":"I call Fresko  my \"Friday Night Date\" because it appears I've developed a craving for their food by the end of the week.  And who wants to cook on Friday night?    So I went again tonight (Friday) AND I was there for lunch today  (Friday).  That's two meals there in the same day. Did I say I love their food?  For lunch my friend and I split the Greek Salad with Chicken Souvlaki on it and the Meze (appetizer) Sampler.  Both were delicious.  I loved getting a little bit of most of the appetizers.  My favorites are the Lamb Souvlaki Plate with the Braised Green Beans.  My second favorite is the Moussaka--yum!  I don't think you can go wrong here.  Another plus, bring your own booze--No corkage fee."}
{"text":"Fresh food, but not as authentic as I would like it to be. I've tried a few things on the menu and they were decent. Lemon chicken soup is good but hit or miss. Nothing like Coney Islands from back home or homemade. Tried the veggie dip plate...it was ok. One thing I did really enjoy was the Moukassa...it was different...delicious and that little extra I look for in a mom and pop shop. Like to go there for a healthy meal option, but  not my 1st choice . When I have the option...I'll reach for something a little more authentic."}
{"text":"Restaurant is pretty pricey for what they're selling. Ladies were very nice and the restaurant seemed very well put together and clean. Most Greek places have a 7 to 8 dollar lunch special but expect to pay over $10 without a drink. Had to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.   Everything we've gotten has been very good.    Is definitely a must try.     They are also byob so you can bring your own wine and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for lunch and dinner. The food is freshly prepared and delicious! If you are a Mousaka fan, get it here! Amazing. They also are BYOB or wine. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Possibly the best Mediterranean food I have ever had, I love the muharama"}
{"text":"I ordered the falafel sandwich and a side cucumber salad today for lunch and it was yummy. The cucumber salad had tomatoes red onion feta and basil, with a delicious vinaigrette. The Falafels were a bit smooth in texture but paired well with the tomato red onion and taziki. I will request adding lettuce next time I order this. Great tea, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy a friend introduced me to this place. Finally a place I can find authentic Greek food.  I am not talking Gyros here.  This last visit we had the Moussaka and Pastichio. Both were delicious. We finished with Rice pudding and Bougatsa, a custard wrapped in phyllo. Heaven! On other visits I have tried the Chicken and Lamb souvlaki (kabobs).  The side dishes are equally tasty.  The atmosphere is casual and the prices are quite reasonable. The owner and employees  make every effort to impress. This will be on our rotation of favorite Restaurants for sure."}
{"text":"I believe our experience could have been better had there been more employees to help out. There was only 1 person working and she was super sweet, it was just busy being a Friday night.   The hummus was the best. You can tell that it was made fresh and the pita bread was warm and super yummy. The large order of hummus is a generous size but they only come with 2 pieces of pita bread so we did order a few extras.   I felt the meatball sandwich was incredibly too expensive for the size that it was. I believe it was $8 and it was shockingly small. At first I wanted it smaller (because it was for my son but they wouldn't offer a smaller portion, and there are no kid's meal) but fortunately - and unfortunately - it was super tiny. Thankfully, it wasn't for my husband! It also came with no sides.   I felt the Greek salad did not come with enough lettuce (weird). It was super yummy but also pretty small considering it was also $8 and a large. Our tab for a family of 5 (5 entrees + hummus, only water) was almost $70 w/o tip. Of course I did include tip.. :)  We may go back but only if we're really craving Greek food and not willing to drive a little further for somewhere else (Opa in Tempe).   I do want to confirm that the lady working there was very, very nice and the atmosphere was good/clean. I just can't pay that kind of money for such small servings."}
{"text":"Authentic Greek cooking and I know the difference.  Hats off to Cody and her crew!  The fasolada and baklava were excellent.  Pitas were fresh and tasty. Making good Greek food is time consuming to make and expensive.  This restaurant has well-priced good food and we recommend it!"}
{"text":"Cute looking small place but for what you get, small portions, expensive and mediocre taste. Definitely not worth it.  Green Corner in Mesa is way better."}
{"text":"Wow! Really yummy. Really fresh. Loved my meal - it was the best falafel I've ever had (including the falafel I had in Israel). Hummus & tabouli was fresh & delish. My husband ordered Pastitsio (Greek lasagna) with white bean salad & Greek fries as sides. Again, delish - all of it! Yes, yes, yes we will come here again!"}
{"text":"Second visit and not my last. Great menu, excellent and authentic food, and amazing service. Had the sampler platter; enough for two. Putting Fresko on my restuarnt rotation."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem. Excellent atmosphere, food and service. The Muhammara was delish!"}
