{"text":"Not really a Mexican restaurant per se. At least not for mexican standards, mais... a good Montreal spirited one: mélange / métis / in between / Nepantla!   Very good as a post-mexican concept. Go with an open mind, and you'll love it!   Highlights: Very good tacos de carnitas & pescado. Delicious home made ginger-ale. Awesome chocolate bar. I'll be back babe..."}
{"text":"I cannot speak for the food, but my brief experience at Mais was not pleasant. I walked in with two friends and it was our first time at the restaurant. After standing at the door for a minute, no one greeted us so we sat at an open table thinking maybe we seat ourselves (there was no signage indicating otherwise). After 5 minutes or so we're finally acknowledged by staff but are told that where we are seating is reserved so basically we need to leave.. They didn't offer to take our number for when space opens up at the restaurant later. As we are packing up to leave, one of the waitresses rudely says \"next time make a reservation\". Yeah, we are already aware of that by now, thank you. Overall, I understand that they were busy and there was no room for us, but the staff were really impolite in their approach to the situation."}
{"text":"Swanky interior, a tad pricey for what it is, but quite delicious. The servers were more than friendly and made good recommendations. You should probably make a reservation beforehand if you plan on going over the weekend, but you could chance it all the same."}
{"text":"I went to Maïs during the day for their lunch special; a choice of three different tacos, or a trio of each. The place is more bar than restaurant, so the ordering system is a bit awkward; you have to order and pay at the bar. I'm not sure if this is how it works when the place is busier at night, but I can only assume a giant clusterfuck around the already limited bar space. Our waitress told us that the tacos change on a weekly basis and was quite helpful when it came to explaining what it was we were ordering."}
{"text":"Came because of good reviews. Mediocre restaurant overall: Appetizers were disappointing tho the tacos were good. Cocktails were awesome."}
{"text":"The tacos are so yummy! and their signature specialty cocktails are perfection!  The service is a bit slow, but definately worth the wait."}
{"text":"My first and sadly my last experience at Maiis was very disappointing!  We've made reservations for two people on a Friday night at 8pm. We were seated in the very back being the last table with little to no light.  We asked to be moved, they moved us in a share table of six other people. With the condition we leave 90 minutes later. By 9:15pm, we were reminded again to leave by 9:30pm.  The music was blasting, so talking was a challenge. Our server was Ok, yet not in a kind and friendly mood.  The food, it was fantastic! Flavourful, lots of texture, fresh and with a mild kick! Sadly, the entire seating experience and the poor service was a turn off for us. I will think twice before returning."}
{"text":"I guess I'm the odd one out for not liking this place but here goes! I wanted to introduce my friend to l'atelier and when we got there it was reserved for an office party. While trying to figure out plan b the manager came out to see us and recommended a few places and have rave reviews to mais. We walked in, the place was cute the layout was nice and the moustached staff was very friendly. They make their own tonic so my gin tonic was absolutely delicious! My friend had the tequila Bloody Caesar and couldn't even finish it, it was just awkward. We got the calamari and the chicken wings for starters: the salad was fine nothing special, a bit stingy with the calamari (cooked pretty well) the chicken wings were so strange. Think of the full Wing doused in tomato sauce and sriracha.  The tacos were insanely disappointing. The pork belly one was not cooked right, it was thick cut and just laid there like a big lump of fat. The braised pork taco was soooo salty I couldn't get over it.  Our bill for the meager and barely edible offerings including 2 drinks was 65$$$$ Again friendly service, barely edible food, high high prices!  Good luck with this one!"}
{"text":"Super good and not expensive at all! Sitting at the bar is also fun as you can see them making everything! Plus, our waiter offered my boyfriend and I a tequila shot after our meal! Really cool :)"}
{"text":"always updating their menu with seasonal and local stuff. delicious and surprising twists on the classics along with some great creative house inspirations. lovely service, great drinks too.  perfect for a casual date or for a hangout with a small group.  they don't take reservations though, so get there early or be prepared to wait. (but they will take your number and call when your table is ready so you can slip down the street to a bar while you wait, so it's never uncomfortable)"}
{"text":"This Place sucks! Terrible service from novice hipster waiters. It took an hour to get a few tacos and it cost around $50/person for what should've been a $10 meal.  Wanted to Love it but ended up hating it!"}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere! Went there with the wife and she said is was very authentic. My wife lived in Mexico for a year and missed the food. But this place is very authentic."}
{"text":"Delicious and suber tasty tacos! I had the fish, the pulled pork and squash taco and all were fab!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner with friends. The service is quick and the food is tasteful. I'm not used to Mexican style food, but I really enjoyed it. It's a perfect spot for groups of peeps that like to share their plates. The decor isn't my taste though, it's a bit too rough with \"chicken fences\"."}
{"text":"Not that impressed with this place. The ambience, decor and service is by far better than the food.  I went there with a group of friends so we ordered one of everything on the menu. My favourite taco was the one with the cheese filled zucchini flower. My least favourite was the black bean paste taco. I love bean paste normally but the texture and taste of this one left me underwhelmed.   Their calamari/squid/ceviche style salad is extremely good (and spicy)!   Apart from that nothing else really stood out. We ate everything because we were all really hungry but after we left we couldn't think of any particular reason to go back.   I want to experience tacos that will leave me craving them all day, every day! lol   Despite my low score their communal tables and friendly service deserve a visit. I will definitely give them another chance if they update their menu."}
{"text":"Last night went to Maïse with a friend and tried a variety of tacos. I tried carnitas, chorizo and beef.  The tacos were well garnished but a tad too small. Also the food took quite some time to get prepared. If you lived in Mexico or southern California you might not be very impressed but this restaurant has the location going for it if you wanna grab a drink a little food this is a potential spot to check out."}
{"text":"My girlfriend & I enjoyed the tacos, but the attitude in this joint just plain stinks. Our bartender Dan was cool, but he was the exception to the hostess, who certainly seems to believe the world spins on her axis.   It was 6:15, the place was empty but we were sat at the bar, with only 4 spots to choose from. We were told we had until 8 before they'd change over to the next reservation. No problem, I'd mentioned we'd only need about an hour, already. Just as I was about to tuck into my plate, she reached across and over my plate to grab the interac machine. When we left at 7:45, most of the tables remained empty. She was happy to greet her friends with big hugs and smiles, while new customers just didn't seem worthwhile. Another Mile End spot that started out well but has taken the hype way too much to heart.  Hipster heaven, especially when it comes to smug."}
{"text":"Quel endroit mignon! J'ai vraiment aimé la décoration et l'ambiance de cet endroit. Le menu est très simple, 3 tacos et un dessert à un prix fixe. Il y a trois choix de tacos, j'ai pris un de chaque avec la salsa épicé verde, quel délice!!! Le dessert aussi était excellent. Mon ami a trouvé que ce n'était pas beaucoup de nourriture mais j'étais personnelement satisfaite! J'y retournerais."}
{"text":"It was my first time there and honestly i was really disappointed. I tried the carnitas and they not even looked like real mexican carnitas, the chorizo was ok but whats really bad is the service OMG i asked for a second beer three times and it never came, the hostess and the waitress were extremely rude.      That was the first and last time in Mais"}
{"text":"Slow service left me woozy from the margarita... with no food to compensate. The good was good and the service other than pace was very nice and helpful. The food was definitely tasty but not as much as I expected considering the price of a taco is $4 or so."}
{"text":"Waited over 1 hour for food and to me it did not taste good. The drinks however were delicious and original."}
{"text":"We were able to get a table the last-minute on line on a Saturday night. We were pleasantly surprised! Everyone spoke great English and greeted us with open arms. Our reservation was ready with in five minutes. The premium margarita was great.  Hubby really enjoyed the guacamole and chips.  The hit of the night was sharing all of the different tacos and sides.  My favorite taco was actually the sweet potato taco followed by the chorizo and then the beef. Hubby's favorite taco was the sweet potato followed by the chorizo and then Carnitas. Potato in butter sauce a must! Black beans were good too.  We were definitely surprised that this wonderful local spot was not touristy at all!"}
{"text":"You can tell that the tacos are made with high quality ingredients but there is something a bit off about the flavour, it's definitely not traditional Mexican tacos but I'd call it French Canadian tacos?!  It's a bit expensive, 50$ for 2 for one drink and 3 tacos person...the atmosphere is hip and cool decor but well that won't make me go back."}
{"text":"Loving the rustic trend and a twist on the traditional . The place looks good but not much room. The food is what I like.. Bite size so you can have a taste test of a little of everything. It's a must to try a few times."}
{"text":"Great arctic char tacos, but one was enough. Huge portion of beef, and it's quality, in the beef taco. and it's all super affordable. Needs more chili peppers, though."}
{"text":"The calamari was fantastic. The tacos were nice but there are better ones around. Our server was very funny and definitely enhanced the experience. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Food was very good (carnitas tacos are the best!), the hipster atmosphere may not be for everyone but it has its charm.  Service is definitely the weak point here... Getting eye contact with the waiter/waitress is challenging at best."}
{"text":"I'm from Southern California and these tacos are as good as it gets.  Slow cooked, marinades, demi-glace, melt in your mouth selections.  The steak tacos are outrageously good.  Delicately balanced, well - thought out. Great service."}
{"text":"Très bon tacos et bouffe mexicaine Très bon service Dommage qu'il n'y ait pas des plats ''avantageux'' pour le midi, car à 4$ le petit tacos, le lunch revient quand même cher..."}
{"text":"I love tacos and Mais definitely has some solid taco making skills! Their menu isn't extensive but everything we ate was delicious! Fish taco was tasty and I loved the cauliflower taco which was a delicious vegetarian option. Only complaint; service was a little slow... My friends and I were wondering if they went to Mexico to get the tortillas!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying Mais based on the strong reviews. We started off with a root vegetable salad which was quite tasty and had a nice flavour profile. We ordered fish tacos, a pinto bean taco, and the celeriac taco.   I'm sorry to say that the fish tacos, which were served with cabbage, avocado, and chili tasted like coleslaw with served with something mushy. There was no spice or salt, and the chili sauce only made it taste as though eating chopped cabbage with some spice. The pinto bean taco, with tomatillo, queso fresco, and morita also tasted as though I was eating baked beans on a taco. I couldn't taste any of the other ingredients. In a change of pace, the celeriac taco didn't taste mushy, but aside from the pineapple, the other ingredients didn't have much presence.  When the waitress asked us how we enjoyed our meal, I told her that aside from the salad, we both found that the tacos were mushy and without any flavour. She didn't apologise or ask what went wrong; all she said was that she had never heard anyone make that comment before and that everyone else enjoyed their food.  For $40, a lack of response from the restaurant when faced with some honest feedback and a lack of apology or at least regret that we didn't enjoy our meal, my money is better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Omg 5 stars. I don't understand why the bad reviews, coming from Los Angeles with a ton of options in Mexican food, I can honestly say the food was delicious and the service was incredible. Carlos was amazing! ask for him! I will definitely be back next time I come to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Vraiment Nice comme place.  Cocktail et bouffe vrmt bonne staff super cool! Ambiance festive!"}
{"text":"It is different from the usual hard shell tacos but its as good as those traditional ones, or even better. Went there twice, once in summer and once during winter, and they had different vege tacos in their menu depending on the season I think. The vegetarian ones are not really good tbh, i tried the beans one and it lacked a bit of flavour. BUT, the meatty ones are ALL suuuper tastyyyy (the shredded pork one is the only one i havent tried yet). The beef tongue is amazing omg the meat is super soft and melts in your mouth! they are so generous with their portion too, we got a really big piece of salmon for the salmon taco (also one of my favourite). Every taco is just so tasty, the sauce and the complementary ingredients are so on point: there is always a combo of spicy or sour with savoury.  Even their appetizers are great! Loved the beef tartare, the chewy texture of the beef and the crispyness of the chips on top were just perfect.  The portion looks small but they are really filling. I was full after 3 tacos but i also ordered appetizers.   The decor is so nice, the candle and the dim light just makes it the best spot for a date.  One thing I didnt like was that the waiter keep on making us leave as he keep on taking away my plate when i was actually waiting for my next batch of tacos. The restaurant wasn't even full so idk why he was being so pushy at the end and didnt want us to stay a bit longer."}
{"text":"Great drinks, good food and great service. We fell upon this place by mistake last year and were pleasantly surprised. Whenever we are in the neighbourhood we make a point of stopping for dinner. I didn't give it a 5 star only because the fish taco did not have the wow factor as everything else. It was quite bland. Otherwise I definitely recommend and save room for the chocolate bar!"}
{"text":"Do you like soggy, bland and unoriginal tacos? Then Mais is for you! Tacos are basic, nothing impressive and definitely not worth it. I would not recommend"}
{"text":"Restaurant Maïs, situé sur St-Laurent près de St-Viateur, est un restaurant de tacos.  Je dois dire tout de suite que j'y suis été le midi. Le menu est différent du soir, il y a seulement 3 tacos offerts en combo.  On y voit la petite touche Mile-End juste à voir le menu de drinks.   L'intérieur est modeste, on y voit de la décoation comme sur Pinterest : des bidons accrochés au plafond et des lampes suspensdues. Il y a une longue table en plein milieu et des petites tables un peu partout. Ce n'est pas un grand restaurant, mais il doit rentrer un 30-35 personnes.  Si on regarde la bouffe...  et bien, vous ne serez pas déçu!  3 tacos : -Porc effiloché -Agneau -Pommes de terre et feta  Je dois dire que je suis quelqu'un de plus viande, mais c'était intéressant comme taco végé.  Le service est d'une rapidité étonnante. Après un 10 minutes vous recevrez à votre table vos trois tacos ainsi que le dessert dans un bel emballage.  J'y suis été pour un diner rapide, mais j'ai hâte d'y retourner pour un souper et déguster plus de tacos. Si j'avais à comparer avec le Icehouse... je dirais que le rapport qualité prix est beaucoup mieux chez Maïs."}
{"text":"Avec tous les restaurants de tacos du coin, pourquoi choisir le Maïs?   Ça commence avec la déco un peu rustique mais chaleureuse, la bonne musique juste assez forte, les lumières de Noël qui pendent du plafond et les chandelles dans des pots massons. Ils ne prennent pas les réservations, alors si on arrive et qu'il n'y a pas de place disponible l'hôte prend notre numéro de téléphone et nous propose d'aller prendre un verre dans les bars avoisinants en attendant. J'ai vraiment apprécié, ça nous évite de devoir attendre debout et être torturé par les délicieuses odeurs émanants de la cuisine!  Une fois assis à table, la nourriture. Les tortillas de maïs étaient tendres, mais si tendres! Je n'ai pas d'éloges à faire pour les entrées, mais les tacos étaient tout simplement sublimes. Mon coup de coeur du repas va à la salsa de graines de citrouilles. Un peu comme du beurre de noix, mais avec une texture plus consistante et une pointe de piquant, c'était le complément original parfait à tous tacos, particulièrement celui de courgette et fromage frais. Pour être honnête, on a même terminé le pot de salsa à la cuillère! Checkez moi ben aller dans ma cuisine pour essayer de reproduire ça... Et pour terminer le repas, on opte pour deux desserts, le shortcake aux fraises et la barre de chocolat. Le sel venait complémenter à merveille l'amerture du chocolat, amerture que j'ai trouvé limite trop présente. Par contre, le shortcake. Quelle surprise! Une délicate crème, des fraises savoureuses, un subtil goût de gingembre et une gelée à la réglisse qui tapissait le fond du petit bol. Je ne m'attendais pas à tomber sur un dessert aussi surprenant, une merveilleuse finale pour un délicieux repas.  Ce qui démarque le Maïs, c'est aussi ses cocktails. C'est l'fun de pouvoir bien manger et boire des bons drinks en même temps, pas juste du vin ou de la bière! La liste est si originale que s'en est difficile de faire un choix, on passe du margarita à la bière renversée dans un verre de clamato aux drinks à base de rhum. Par contre, si vous êtes un fan de bourbon comme moi, le Old fashionned fumé est un must. Je voudrais aussi ajouter 2-3 thumbs up pour le service vraiment rapide malgré le nombre important de clients, on voit qu'ils sont efficaces en cuisine et organisés en salle!  Je suis du genre à préférer essayer un nouveau restaurant plutôt que de retourner à un endroit que je connais déjà, même si je l'aime beaucoup. Par contre, je retournerais au Maïs 1000 fois sans hésiter, je pense même que je vais y trainer mes amis, mes cousins, ma soeur et mon chat. Oui, j'ai aimé ça à ce point là."}
{"text":"I drove into Montreal from Brooklyn around 8pm and I was starving. Luckily my friend lives a couple of blocks from this place. It was recommended to us by one of her friends. I'm glad we went and was pleasantly surprised!  The decor is great. There is a lot of communal sharing tables or tables for two or a seat at the bar. It just felt cozy in there. The waitstaff is super awesome too. At first glance they're mostly stylish men of the hipster variety. However compared to Billyburg, they're clean (no greasy out of control beards/hair) and super friendly. I loved our waiter! He was really funny too.  Now the food. I wanted one of everything on the menu, however I only could get two things since it's a cash only place. I opted for a black bean taco with a side of guacamole. Perfect. My friend and I also split the wings. I love spicy food and theses had some kinda of habanero kick. I would definitely get them again, but your sinuses will be open by the time you eat them. I chased it all down with a Dos Equis.  On a side note, I tried my friend's Hibiscus Soda and that was quite tasty for the non-alcoholic beverage.  The only thing I would like to see is an order of guac and chips. Other than that keep up the great work and I'll definitely be back (hopefully before I leave town)."}
{"text":"Just 1 star, and lucky to get that many. I think this place is way overrated, overpriced and complete with overly rude employees. Its a silly little cramped place with average food. The hot sauce was about the only redeeming part of the experience."}
{"text":"La nourriture était excellente! Rien à redire à ce niveau. Par contre, le service laissait à désirer. Nous avions réservé pour 21:15, une table pour 3, et à notre arrivé nous avons attendu environs 10min dans le cadre de porte avant qu'une serveuse nous réponde, pour se faire dire que \"nous étions d'avance\" (à 21:10... soit 5min avant notre réservation) et qu'il faudrait attendre, ou prendre le bar. De là, le service ne s'est pas empiré, mais disons qu'il ne s'est pas amélioré non plus. Le serveur n'a pas du nous sourire de la soirée. Over all, l'endroit vaut la peine d'essayer, mais le service ne me donne pas envi d'y retourner en courant."}
{"text":"Déco chaleureuse,  super ambiance tamisée le soir. Leur Ceviche pétoncle est très bon!  Le seul hic est que leurs tacos sont tous à base de farine de maïs,  je n'aime pas la farine de mais..."}
{"text":"Checking the reviews before eating here you will realise that they are as polarising as they get. In the negative ones I read  \"hipster chefs\", \"expensive\", \"small portions\", \"unfriendly waiters\" etc.! For the \"unfriendly service\" I can only talk about my own experience and I found extremely friendly waiters, as a matter of fact they even offered us our third margarita (very good once btw) for free since the guy at the bar did one too many. But even without freebies they were very cool!  As for the food, if you find it too expensive, portions too small or dare to call the chefs hipsters you clearly don't get it, don't recognise good food if it jumps you in the face and should get the hell out of there and buy yourself a Poutine!! The food is so well thought through!  Every dish we took was a surprising experience in itself, very skillfully executed and rich in taste! Properly my favorite dish was the grilled calamari salad with orange, almonds, onion confit and a little sprinkle of chili (of course)! The calamari had a wonderful smokey roasted flavor, were incredibly tender and combined with the rest of the ingredients it came together amazingly well in our mouth! As of the tacos I was really impressed with the carnitas and how a simple coleslaw on top helped to bring magic into this taco! And hey, they even do deserts well! The chocolate bar flavored with 5 spices, various sorts of chilies and sprinkled with fleur de sel rounded up this great dinner experience which was accompanied by a friendly service and young passionate and easy to talk to chefs and only added up to a bill of 55$ for two drinks incl.! This experience taught me once again to take online reviews with a pinch of salt!"}
{"text":"Un très agréable moment passé à Maïs ce soir. Nous avons partagé à deux en apéritif la courge au queso fundido et champignon qui a été une excellente découverte. Ensuite, nous avons testé trois des tacos de la carte. La qualité et la quantité sont au rendez-vous! On apprécie le mélange des saveurs et le travail des produits. Notre table était à côté de la cuisine et nous avons pu constaté que les cuisiniers prennent grand soin des plats et c'est très appréciable. La décoration et la musique sont aussi des plus non-négligeables.  À refaire, en couple ou entre amis!"}
{"text":"Bien, mais le resto a perdu un peu de son swag du début. Néanmoins, bon et pas cher."}
{"text":"I went with a gang this week and had great service and quite delicious eats. Our waitress was funny and patient and helpful in figuring out how much food to order. We went with the sharing portions and I think this is a really affordable way to go. Lots of pork or chicken and awesome fresh tortillas and all the toppings. If you shared one of these (around $30 for enough meat for 8-12 tacos) between two people and had a couple drinks you'd have a really sweet night out in a sexy, intimate, comfortable room. The fish tacos were extra tasty, but unavailable in the group format when we were there, plenty worth ordering one by one though."}
{"text":"Great tacheria!  Looking for a bite on the cheap, this place is worth checking out.  The atmosphere is perfect for a get together with friends... laidback and easy going!  The tacos, although inexpensive, are deliciously prepared.  The only downside is the wait time to get seated and served, which is usually a good indicator, but might deter some people from going back!  Your call!"}
{"text":"Ça faisait longtemps que je voulais essayer ce restaurant dont j'avais entendu beaucoup de bien, mais j'étais un peu craintif après avoir vu les critiques polarisées ici.  Nous sommes allés à quatre, nous avons eu une place tout de suite sur la longue table partagée. Le service a été rapide et efficace, tant de la serveuse que du barman, qui prenait la peine de venir nous donner nos drinks dès qu'ils étaient prêts. J'ai vu que plusieurs ont eu des problèmes avec leur serveur dans le passé, je ne sais pas si nous avons été chanceux ou si le problème a été réglé par l'établissement, mais rien à redire ici.  Idem pour l'ambiance, très chaleureuse, décor magnifique, bien tamisé, l'étroitesse de l'endroit lui donne un côté authentique, toujours une bonne idée aussi d'avoir une cuisine ouverte pour voir les cuisiniers (et même la plonge!), les salles de bains étaient bien aménagées également.  Nous avons choisi les plats à partager; nous avions le choix entre le carnitas, de la bavette, du poulet ou un poisson entier (dans ce dernier cas il faut commander 24h à l'avance), avec huit accompagnements. Nous avons pris carnitas et bavette (les plats à partager sont pour deux), avec tous les accompagnements (salsa verde, guacamole, crème sûre, ognons caramélisés, etc.), tous excellents.  J'ai été surpris dans l'écart entre les deux plats; alors que la portion de carnitas était trop grosse pour deux, celle de bavette aurait pu sustenter une personne seule. Dans les deux cas cependant c'était délicieux, la bavette juste assez saignante et bien tranchée, le carnitas était bien assaisonné (nous l'avons fini à la fourchette dans le bol...). Ajoutez à ça les tacos bien chauds, c'était génial.  Les cocktails sont très bons aussi, nous avons pris des margaritas généreux en tequila qui aurait pu être un peu plus froids.  Pas d'entrée ni de dessert, la portion était parfaite pour quatre hommes affamés, le quart des plats et trois margaritas me sont revenus à 43$ après taxes mais avant service."}
{"text":"The most esthetically pleasing tacos with a delicious list of cocktails.  Perhaps a bit overpriced, but hey, a girl's got to treat herself once in a while."}
{"text":"Disappointing food. Tacos arrived in cold to lukewarm tortillas. One had a beautiful piece of fish with unremarkable toppings. Considerably more expensive than other Mexican options: Ta Chido, El Rey del Taco, La Matraca. Convivial atmosphere and stylish hipster wait staff."}
{"text":"Loud Hip Hop, salty margaritas and a nice variety of tacos. Maïs is definitely a unique experience.  There was a long wait for a table (they don`t take reservations) but the host gave us the option of passing on a cell phone number which he would call when a spot was free. This was great as it was very very cold outside and the place is tiny so waiting-in wasn't an option. We headed down the street for a drink and ended up missing the call - making our wait a bit longer when we called to check. The owner was GREAT about this - he brought us a round of tequila shots because we waited for a table for over an hour but honestly it was mostly our fault.   My margarita was awesome and authentic and had fresh coriander. Sorry what?! FRESH CORIANDER. So I was pretty happy about that. I had two.  The tacos were good. Nothing to write home about.....reasonably priced and unique flavors. My favorites were the carnitas and the squash, black bean and fresh cheese. The crunchiness of the pork rinds on the carnitas was a really nice touch, and who doesn't like fresh cheese?  All in all, I enjoyed the drinks and the vibe (young, loud, dark, intimate) of this place more-so than the food but I will definitely be returning to see what other taco flavor combinations they come up with"}
{"text":"Last night we got to Mais ridiculously early at 530. It was empty but quickly began to fill up. The hostess, servers, manager, and table runners were all so so kind! The drinks were great! My husband got the mescal old fashioned which I had to steal sips of, and I got the hibiscus soda.   Food, which we got to see lovingly prepared as we sat at the taco bar, was delicious without being too crazy elaborate. The beef tartar appetizer with fingerling potato chips  was fresh and had a great Mexican twist in the flavor. For dinner we had  5 tacos between the two of us. Two pork belly ( the acidity in the vegetables complimented the crema and fat of the pork perfectly), the turkey Barbacoa ( comforting and perfect to dip in the side of quac I got!) and Aaron had the fish. I was considering another round but checked out the desserts and decided to go with the roasted pineapple panna cotta. The vanilla crisps included with the expertly prepare pudding and fruit, well I don't even know how to say it any other way. Yum!   The whole dinner was a flavorful and kind experience."}
{"text":"Okay.. now I get it.. I am going to have to unfortunately update my review, changing this place from one of my potential favorites in Montreal, to one of the most dissapointing.. It turns out the one \"bad\" waitress from last time, was more of a taster of the norm than the other nicer server I managed to find that night.  My sister was visiting town last night, and previously when I went to Mais, I thought she'd love it, like me and my wife do, so I reserved to come here with her.  But from the second we arrived, though, even having reservations, we were just met with severe negativity and dismissive \"service\".. Almost every single thing, from \"Where is the bathroom?\" to \"Any other nice cocktails to have with food here other than margaritas?\" was met with serious disdain. The staffer would stop blank faced, kind of annoyed, mumble something dismissively, and walk off. And we were never sure if he heard or what or what.. And that's if they would answer. A couple times he just lifted his eyebrows in a \"whatever,\" way, no words, and then we'd sit and wait confused and maybe something would show up. It was hit or miss what showed up. About 2/3 of what we ordered.  But then later ordering our food (about an hour into our night), mid sentence from my sister, the guy just pulled away and walked off to the kitchen, we looked at each other confused wondering what just happened, I thought maybe something urgent he forgot.. but then he strolled out, leaned on the bar and joked with another girl server for like 2-3min at the bar, eventually I made eye contact with him gesturing with my hand like \"what's going on?\", he storms back over looking really annoyed now, so when I reminded him of our taco order, and if my sister could finish ordering her food he said something along the lines of, \"Obviously, or what you wanna make it yourself...?\" followed by some nondescript slur under his breathe. He tried to cover it up with a smile, but my sister was furious now about to stand up and lose it on this guy. If I wasn't such a patient person in service situations [I worked as a waiter many times in my life], I wouldve thrown fuel, but I just tried to ignore and gestured for her to not, but thought to myself, \"I'm never coming back here,\" and finished our order. My sister wanted to walk out right then and there, but I said give it a chance still. But the guy then proceeded to smugly slam everything down on the table from then onwards.  There was a very strange inferiority complex stemming from the wait staffers, anything we ordered was sort of met with this weird power struggle spite. There was definitely something going on, it wasn't a normal experience. But impossible to take in stride. Maybe the management/staff were in some kind of internal dispute or something, I dunno, we started to speculate, but that's not my job/role as a customer.   Now. All that said, again, I must note that when the food came, all the tacos: fish, carnitas, others, & drinks were excellent. Really yummy, fresh & well priced. Kitchen/bartenders have got it down. But the wait staff made me feel like complete shit constantly, all of us. And by this point it was really kind of miserable, especially because I knew the bill was going to be well over $100 (I really wanted to have a great night with my sister/pay for all of us).  Anyhow, eventually I asked the staffer what was wrong, or if we had done something, to which the guy smiled and exclaimed \"Nothing at all man, why?!\" very joyfully/off-guard. But then it just continued, so I think he was being sardonic in retrospect. Anyway, we figured maybe it was just the one guy (last time I had a hit/miss thing with the staffers too), maybe having a bad night, so I asked another wait girl, and weirdly she did almost the exact same!. Just the same angry face, disdainful treatment, an entirely \"fuck you customer\" experience. It was really disheartening. Just a two hour painful \"hospitality\" nightmare.  When it came to the end, whatever \"it\" was, I asked for the bill. I left 0 tip. First time ever in my whole life. But it was the only way I knew how to express my anger without lowering myself to what they were doing. But sadly, I felt I was still well over a $100 short, and really really upset by the loss of money and horrible experience. Obviously the staff didn't say anything, because it was obvious how out of line their \"service\" was.   I can never ever return here now. Even if I wanted to, the staffers have made it ethically impossible for me. And that is a real shame, because I loved it before. Bad service is one thing, but paying ppl to treat you like shit (especially as a high paying return customer with reservations) is just completely out of line (regardless of previous experiences). And it wasn't a busy night. The onus is totally on management to realize that they have ppl working for them that are actively destroying what should easily be a fantastic place."}
{"text":"Rien de compliqué mais les tacos sont chauds et biens garnis.  Ce qui est selon moi le \" high light\" de la soirée est l'excellent service qui nous a été prodigué par Rena.  Celui ci était juste dans tous les sens et il vaut certainement une étoile a lui seul."}
{"text":"I'm a lover of Mexican food and always interested in supporting local businesses (plus I have a friend who works there and encouraged me to to check it out) so I was happy to discover Mais a few weeks back.   I found it to be a cozy, bustling joint where it was easy to people-watch since most of the young crowd were seated at long picnic-like tables. I thought the tacos were artfully plated and had a few little twists. The ricotta-squash sounded the most interesting, but I personally found it bland and too rich. The Carnita was the winner for me - tender meat with crispy pork rind and salsa verde - and delicious paired with a Tecate. My vegetarian compadre seemed happy with her marguerita even though it was in a smurf-sized glass and she declared the fish taco trumped the mushroom/squash. There are vegetarian options yes...but I found them to be the weakest links on the menu. A spicy bean/smoked tofu would certainly make a nice addition...  There was little room for dessert (at only three tacos each and beverages we were stuffed) but we shared a home made chocolate bar (a dense, chocolate cookie bar). I liked the concept but the actual dessert left something to be desired. If it had been moister or glazed with a cinnamon-chocolate ganache it might have stood out. As it stood - it sat.   Yes, Mais is currently a hot spot. No, it's not your authentic Texan taco feast at $1.25 apiece with a variety of amazing salsas, fresh cilantro etc. BUT that being said it was a night well spent. I'd return for a drink and a snack but probably not for a full dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch, and was pleasantly surprised to be quickly seated by the very affable staff. The carrot-mole tacos were easily the star of the show. Very affordable and comfortable on a chilly day to a few Americans."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but service and food do not meet it. I suspect the very hard sitting is to make sure people don't stay too long. The staff does the job but without much enthusiasm. The tacos look appetizing and freshly made but lack a bit of taste personality. Unfortunately ingredient nowadays are tasteless so up to the Chef to enhance their flavor. If you take the chocolate bar I suggest you pair it with Disarono."}
{"text":"Went here on recommendation from our Air B & B hosts.  We loved it!  We had margaritas, a wonderful tartare, clams, and shared some tacos."}
{"text":"Absolutely generic and disappointing food, all dressed up with nowhere to go.  Bland, overpriced, and sometimes  just bad or odd combinations (trout in a fish taco was rank). The 'Ceviche' they serve was completely unrelated to ceviche, just a few raw slices of fish that weren't even marinated in anything, and some corn to make it 'Mexican'.. Overpriced joke.  Seems like the restaurant was just cashing in on the upscale Mexican trend without any of the chefs or owners having ever visited Mexico.  A taco at even the most basic taco truck in NYC or elsewhere is filled with way more pop and flavour than anything found here.   Wait staff was clueless when we arrived, seating us first at the bar, then at the back, then back at the bar, then made us move three seats over even though during out whole meal the place was virtually empty. Very odd.   Bartender was very nice, and the only reason I don't give this place one star."}
{"text":"Very cute set-up, cozy tables and bar seats (unless you're the unlucky tables in the corridor to the bathroom). The food is amazing. A little bit overpriced I felt, but still very enjoyable!! We found it was a bit of a wait until we got our tacos but they eere simply amazing, especially the fish one. Try to save some room for desert - loved the chili chocolate bar and the popsicles looked grest, too. I would definitely go back, probably with a bunch of people as it seems to be a nice spots for a group to share a long table!   - Cash only but ATM in the back - No reservation but they took our cell phone number and called us when the table was ready. So we went for a beer at the Waverly across the street!"}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken wings, 3 types of tacos and the guac. Based on my experience in mexican type restaurants, their food was very \"MEH\".  The tacos we're not tasty at all and I didn't enjoy them. I found them very bland.  The chicken wings were nice and spicy, but too big in my opinion.  I was expecting something crispy, and the wings came out saucy. I also ordered a mojito that was very watered down and I couldn't even taste the alcohol. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Very disappointed; pulled pork tacos (table for 28$) is served now as jarret de porc wich means they bring you this huge bone with tons of fat and little meat which you have to cut yourself in this very limited space we had for six people (end of the table, where usually 4 people would sit comfortably). We were served this jarret de porc with a butter knife... when we asked for a meat knife the waitress said she didn't have one... we were speechless... trying to maneuver in such confined space was a struggle. Thankfully the busboy brought us a real knife... another surprise: guacamole, sour cream, cheese (all the goodies that used to be included) are now extras! + margaritas used to be excellent, now they make them very diluted. Disappointment after disappointment. Never going back."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad. The tacos are a bit on the pricier side ($3 and up), as are their drinks (a bit tiny), but both taste rather great! The fish taco is simply delicious, and while we ordered a few carnitas tacos, it was a bit inconsistent (ok the first time and dry and bland after). They have community tables but these can bd reserved. The service, however, is a bit slow, and it is quite dark inside, but worth checking out."}
{"text":"J'avais une réservation pour 13 et on m'a offert une table de 12. Ils ont une salle pour les groupes plus gros, mais disons que j'avais un nombre chanceux qui ne fittait nulle part. Mis à part le fait qu'on était tassés, j'ai pris un cocktail Tequila et pamplemousse qui était bon, compte tenu que j'aime les trucs frais et pas trop sucrés. L'entrée de salade de betterave tiède était super et un peu épicée. Bon choix pour végétariens et possibilité de s'adapter aux végétaliens. Plutôt dispendieux pour les tacos, mais c'était goûteux!"}
{"text":"Wow quel superbe bar à Tapas ! Les tapas sont délicieux, originaux et métissés, pas chers pour leur qualité . Le service est super ...  Et le bar très chaleureux où il fait bon discuter avec ses voisins de table. On y fait de belles rencontres ... Même s'il faut faire un peu la queue, cela en vaut  la peine ! Une nouvelle adresse à explorer !"}
{"text":"I think this place is underrated. It has a nice atmosphere. Very good tacos and misc plates. A must-try Mexican chocolate \"bar\" w coarse salt. Good drinks. Mega nice chef/co-owner. I think it compares very favourably to the more popular Grumman. Resto Mais also has a lovely private room for groups. The closest comp in town to gourmet hipster tacos that I loved in Chicago, NYC, and LA."}
{"text":"J'ai demandé à mon être cher, sors-moi à un endroit surprise. C'est chez Maïs que j'ai abouti. Quelle merveilleuse idée! D'abord, on ne peut passer à côté de la michelada, tout est dans le détail. La bouteille de bière est à l'effigie du resto, les épices sont judicieusement collées sur le rebord du verre en une forme rappelant la lèvre inférieure. Les tacos sont exquis et vraiment très très garnis. Je crois que demander 1 tortilla supplémentaire par taco aurait permis de déguster plus facilement. Je suis tombée à la renverse en mordant dans un taco à la fleur de courgette. Tout était délectable. Je sens naître en moi une obsession du taco. À bientôt Maïs!"}
