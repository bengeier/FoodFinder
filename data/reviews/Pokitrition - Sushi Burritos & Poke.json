{"text":"The poke bowl was so yum and flavorful. The service was really quick as well. There is a definite lunch rush so get in early."}
{"text":"I had the best poke bowl I've yet had at a very reasonable price! I come from the Bay, and this place definitely rivals CA in terms of quality and amount of food you get for the price.

The ambiance is casual, comfortable, and relaxed. The folks working there are nice, very well informed, and efficient. The fish tastes fresh and delicious. The level of customization is great.

I had their half rice, half salad bowl and near drowned it in a double side of seaweed salad. I would recommend the seaweed salad! I would also recommend their cold brew peach green tea - slightly sweet and very refreshing. 

So glad this place exists in Chandler! Definitely coming back again and again."}
{"text":"I come here once a week for lunch from work. Very fresh. Seems healthy too but would be nice to know what the calorie fat count is. If I knew it was as healthy as I think it is I would come more often. I always get the poke bowl with brown rice salmon and marinated tuna and jalapeños, spicy crab, and all the toppings like mango, edamame, masago, etc and (pay extra for avocado). Hits the spot every time. Ends up being a bit pricey at almost $12. Fills you up. But doesn't leave you feeling bad or stuffed / lethargic. I'd get the wrap which is like a giant sushi roll if they served it with brown rice (for health reasons). Try it out!"}
{"text":"Sushi 'burrito' customized? How can you complain? The wait is long, but it's new and delicious so it's expected. Anticipate 1-2 hour weight. The food is affordable - around $10 for a bowl or wrap. The fish is quality and there are several options. The location is small and more designed for take out. Will definitely return but it's soooo far for me in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and helpful.  It was a great value as compared to eating at a sushi restaurant.  Great flavors and textures in the food.  Highly recommend it and will be back!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. My husband and I drive from Payson to come here. It's fresh, it's delicious, it's amazing. I love this place. They remember me everytime I come in. I order bowls to take home for my husband and I. I can't wait until they have online ordering available!"}
{"text":"I decided to try Pokitrition after seeing many pictures of sushi burritos, it exceeded all my expectations. The burrito was delicious. Being able to turn your favorite poki bowl into a burrito is unique and makes for a great meal. The restaurant was nice and staff was friendly. I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!! Must get the wrap/burrito. The teas are amazing as well. Wish there was more seating but overall great atmosphere. The customer service is always great and they are fast! One of my favorite places to get lunch."}
{"text":"Voor het eerst dit concept geprobeerd. Je eigen salade of burrito samenstellen. In fases mag je twee ingrediënten uitkiezen. Eigenlijk moet je het zien als een grote sushirol. Wij vonden de salade en de burrito's echt heel erg lekker. De bediening was ook super. Legden bij binnenkomst uit hoe het werkte en waren zeer vriendelijk."}
{"text":"I will be back - let's get that out of the way.  I went in and kind of felt blind since there was no menu to grab, or anything to go off of when you walk in the door.  However, I soon realized it is set up like Chipotle; pick your mode, protein, and toppings down the line and voila!  I was originally going to get a bowl, but when I saw how the rice was steamy and then they put the raw fish on top with the other cold toppings, I felt like this pairing was sacrilege - and would not pass the freshness test on my trek back to work.  So I went with the Poke Roll (a sushiritto!).  Got double salmon; they sort of make you choose a crab mix and a seaweed salad.  I was not really a fan of either, to be honest.  The seaweed salad is stringy and gets stuck in your teeth, and really didn't lend much as far as flavor goes.  I'll opt out of both the next time.  What I really didn't appreciate was the oil on my seaweed wrap.  I understand the importance of a non-stick situation when you're banging out rolls, but at the expense of an oily sushi roll?  Hard Pass.  All in, the salmon was a good consistency, but could have been colder - this can be solved by popping it into the freezer for a few minutes before digging in.  The rice was perfect, the available toppings were colorful and fresh - the taste was great, but I will try it in a bowl next time - and ask for cold rice!  They get extra points for the little to-go containers of ginger and wasabi ;)"}
{"text":"I love this place, they offer diced mango and I've not been able to get that anywhere else. Although I wish they offered avocado."}
{"text":"You pick out what protein, vegetables, and toppings you want. Pay at the counter. Eat. Food is pretty good. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Love the quality of this place's food every time we come here, but we came in Sunday night and didn't like the service of one of the cashiers (medium sized Asian male worker with a hat). He was rude ringing us up because it was 15 mins before closing. We weren't the last customers so he shouldn't have been annoyed at us and second we asked them if we could still get something when we went in and all the workers said yes. I would have given this 5 stars, but that cashier's rudeness and unprofessionalism was why I wanted to give this place 0 stars. We even asked him since there were 4 of us if we can gets stamps for all the bowls on one stamp card and he said if we are paying with two different cards then no. Honestly if that's your policy then that doesn't make sense and isn't a good business practice. Then when my friend got rang up buy the other cashier (smaller Asian male worker) he was nicer, polite, and more professional. We liked him better and he is what real customer service is about and why I added 2 stars."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my brother. He had the tuna bowl and I had the salmon wrap. Both were really good and satisfying. The ingredients are fresh and price right. Very friendly staffs and clean environment. I'll be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. It was a little bit pricey for two people $30. The restaurant was clean and the customer service was awesome!"}
{"text":"I ate here a few weeks ago the sushi burrito is such a genius idea. So Americanized, it's perfect. The lady that made my burrito wasn't very attentive at my novice decisions. My sushi burrito, I think could have been better with expert advice. I suggest if the people could give ideas for better combinations to pick on a sushi burrito because I don't know what pairs nicely with what. My floppy version was alright but it wasn't great. So in a way I'm putting myself down not the restaurant. Just suggest better stuff with the burrito if you see a noob ordering."}
{"text":"Totally worth the visit for the poke burrito. Haven't tried their poke bowl yet, but the burrito alone deserves 5 stars! No other place in the valley to get it! Place is small, but well kept and clean, staff is extremely helpful and nice. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Loved the burrito option which had sushi rice with a layer of seaweed. Marinated tuna had good flavors that were enhanced by the ponzu sauce. Get the spicy crab and seaweed salad mixed with edamame, mango, and wontons and you've got a winner! Everyone there is really friendly too! Mmm now I'm drooling just thinking about it! Gotta go back soon!"}
{"text":"Yum! Just... yum! Ingredients were fresh, colorful and tasty! I had the bowl- half brown rice, half salad, half salmon and half marinated tuna. Delish! I loaded up on the veggies and the sesame added a crunch. Customer service was speedy and friendly! Thanks for a yummy dinner!"}
{"text":"Okay, This place has a lot of good reviews and I would say it is better then Ahipoke but it's still not good! My co worker and I came on our lunch break we both have the same opinion. I usually like to cook my salmon which they were unable to do.. The sauces were not impressive and they barely put any on my salad or rice. It cost a minimum of $10 I got a drink and avocado so my total was $15 I really really wanted to love this place but I am going to have to skip eating here."}
{"text":"Portions and taste have decreased lately.  It seems like you have to know them or something to get a full bowl or burrito.  My bowl ended up being half full while the customer before me had his bowl packed to the brim.

I recommend looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just came here with my family and this place is very clean and nice.  The food is very good and tasty"}
{"text":"I was invited here for a business meeting and have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I had never been to a POKE restaurant before so I didn't know what i was getting myself into.  Since I was out of my element, I asked the server to build a bowl by his recommendation. It was amazing. This place is on my regular rotation now. Love it!"}
{"text":"Was very excited when I saw this place opening so close to me. I first went in on the soft opening, they didn't have a lot of options. The bowl wasn't very flavorful their sauces lack a certain kick. I decided to give them another chance since it was a soft opening. So I tried again, the rice has improved sauces still not that great and for the amount you get it's overpriced.
Maybe I will try again in the future, for now I'll stick with Ahi poke bowl"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out. It was great. I liked all the variety and choices. The sushi was fresh and delicious. The only downside is location and seating. This place should upgrade to a real eatery so the patrons can enjoy the place and the food."}
{"text":"I am from LA where there is a poke shop in every corner and I was craving for Poke when I was in town visiting friends and Pokitrition was the closest one to me. 

Walked in and was greeted with a smile by lively employees. The process is similar to poke shops out in LA where you pick the base, fish, sauce and toppings. 

They were telling me the tuna is from Hawaii and i could definitely taste the difference. It didn't taste like the fish from LA at all. We definitely need more places like this in LA!

The fish was just sooo fresh. It definitely tasted like fish you get from a plate of sashimi"}
{"text":"First timers and it blew my mind! Poki burrito you are my everything!  super fresh and flavorful!"}
{"text":"I've tried a few poke places around the valley and this is still the best poke here in the east valley. I think their prices are fair and they are not skimpy on the fish and toppings, which I can totally appreciate. Honestly, we are not coming for the rice and toppings, it's all about the poke! lol Thank you Pokitrition, and please come to Gilbert!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent! I ordered a poke bowl with marinated tuna, spicy tuna, spicy crab, onions, avocado, on top of brown rice and covered in their shoyu sauce. The food I ordered was absolutely delicious and filling. My food tasted fresh, flavorful with every bite just as enjoyable as the first!

The customer service here is top notch. The employees are very friendly and immensely great to talk to. They give the restaurant a wonderful atmosphere. If you haven't tried this yet, I'd recommend coming here when you have the chance.

I've been here quite often and I can't express enough how great their customer service is!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!  I've been twice in the past 5 days. If you like sushi, the GIANT Poke wrap is for you. $10 will get you so much protein of your choice, incredible sauces and all the veggies you can stuff in the rice wrap. You will be happy with your choice as all the food is fresh and staff is very helpful. I will be back....soon. I want to try the Poke Bowls too!"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a poke kind of guy,  my Girlfriend is.  
We decided to try this place out and well,  it was easy to order,  they had a fair selection of toppings. 

Only thing that bothered me a little was how pricey it was.  
They sell a \"box\" water,  which was like $4 or something,  but they did have complimentary water on the side,  which was good."}
{"text":"I love sushi and a poke bowl is everything inside a sushi roll. The food is very fresh and the staff is very courteous. I love the build your own poke bowl and I can put everything I want into it. I have not tried the poke burrito but it looks absolutely amazing.  I can't say anything negative about this place because it's everything I imagined and more.  If you go on a Friday or Saturday it gets pretty busy but the wait is not long at all.  Just seating would be limited."}
{"text":"Best sushi burritos in Southern AZ that I've tried so far. Wish they offered cream cheese and wasabi so I could make a prope Philly Burrito. Wife tried Poke Bowl and said it was light, fresh and filling. One of our favorite stops and it's right in the neighborhood from work."}
{"text":"Ambience: Walking into this restaurant, it the decor is really nice. They have a wooden pallet themed wall throughout. Small space but it's perfect. I really liked the feel and vibe. 

Customer Service: Picture this... a hipster sushi restaurant. That's the only way I can describe it. All of the employees were happy and smiling. It was my first time there so they explained how it worked and all the ingredients. The tuna is flown in fresh from Hawaii everyday. Just incredible. 2 thumbs up to the management and team. 

Food: It's sushi so it's pricey. Having said that, the food was absolutely delicious and the sauces they mix in are so tasty. I didn't want to meal to end. You will not be upset, and do what I did and get a wrap not a bowl. You won't be disappointed. The sushi was fresh and you can taste it. In mine I had shrimp, tuna, salmon, Sriracha sauce, edamame, seaweed salad, mango, roe, green onion, roasted sesame seeds. Wow. Once again, 2 thumbs up. 

Drinks: The drink I had was delicious. It was a mango tea locally brewed. It wasn't too sweet but just really fresh tasting. I really wish they had Simple Soda!

Restrooms: They maintained the wooden pallet theme in the bathroom too and it was very clean. Nice job. 5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"I have been to Pokitrition several times now and I look for excuses to go back, even though it is not close to me. 
I have ordered both the burritos and the bowls, with and without rice. I try something different every time and have not been disappointed yet. Great options for a low carb or paleo family member as they can order the salad.
If you can't make up your mind, don't do the half and half. It just gets messy. Opt for the rice bowl and try the salad another time. It's an option for indecision, but I don't think it is as enjoyable is totally committing to one or the other. Just do the classic bowl if you're not sure. 
Regardless of what you order, I do suggest going for the rice seasoning. It adds so much to the dish.
I love their sweet green tea. Has a bite, which is why I order it sweetened. The black is amazing both ways.
Recently took a friend who is currently low carb and low sugar while she is leading up to her wedding, she completely fell in love with this place. 
It is getting popular, so don't freak out if there is a line. The staff is friendly and quick.
Go for the reward card, you'll be back!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place and now every time I get a bowl it is smaller and smaller. I get the fish needs to be portioned out, but I think a little extra rice and toppings wouldn't hurt when paying 11 dollars for a bowl. 

Side note: the workers need to pay a little more attention and layoff of whatever they were taking. I watched one glassy eyed worker dump an entire container of crunchy onions on the sushi burrito in front of my order."}
{"text":"Not all poke places are equal! Love this place! I always get the poke burrito and it's filled with yummy goodness! They are very generous with their portions. I really like the Yuzu Ponzu with spicy mayo, and a side of sesame shoyu...yeah, I'm all about the sauces!

The fish and all ingredients are fresh and the service is friendly and efficient. The restaurant is bright and clean. 

They also have a punch card to reward repeat customers!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and delicious.  I ordered multiple poke bowls and used the order cards that I printed out from their website which made it easy.  That way I didn't have to worry about getting anything wrong for my husband as he got to pick all of his ingredients.  I had the spicy tuna and the marinated tuna, and although the spicy tuna was good, I liked the marinated tuna even better and think I will get a double serving next time.  I also would be interested in adding additional fish because the serving is not big.  I also thought they were very light on the cucumber and would have liked more. Next time I will ask for it and see what happens. They charge 9.95 for the make your own bowl and an additional 1.95 for extra fish.  The staff was super nice and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"I rarely yelp but this place has earned my time and 5-stars. I'm pretty obsessed with their poke wraps. They are a perfect balance of being so clean and fresh while still filling. The wrap is HUGE and my husband and I often split one. I recommend the spicy tuna + marinated tuna, ponzu & siracha sauces and all the toppings. Our littles (who do actually eat this kind of food too) eat a side of rice and miso soup if they aren't feeling like a wrap or bowl. 

The staff is super helpful and nice and the menu is simple and affordable. I think that is why they have completely nailed the taste. They focused on one thing and hit it out of the park. This might be a weekly visit for us. Highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place! The only bad thing I have to say is that it's too far but worth the drive.  My husband and I try to make a trip on the weekends. We live in Peoria. And we even go with our 5 month old baby.  The staff seems really young, but they have great customer service."}
{"text":"I was super disappointed with this location (Phoenix). I live in Peoria and will drive weekly to go the location in Chandler. I was excited that there was one close to my work in Phoenix. I ordered online and my coworker offered to go pick them up. When I got my order I seriously thought it was part of the kid's menu. I have never seen it so chinsy before. It was missing half the stuff I ordered on it. I got the Poke Salad no rice. The picture I took had not been eaten yet, just mixed around (hoping to find the rest of it underneath)... Nope, no luck. I will try it again and see if they just had a one off day. Hopefully, my next visit will be a better one and I can change this review. But about the food... The salmon tasted fresh and it was still good. The surimi crab tasted hard. There were a few greens that were soggy and none of the stuff I ordered was on. Hope my next visit will be a good one!"}
{"text":"Best poké spot I've been to yet!! The ingredients are good quality, and the staff is always friendly =)"}
{"text":"I don't usually leave reviews... but after stopping by this place. I HAD to!

After shopping at Chandler Mall, I was feeling for some sushi so went onto Yelp to see what was around. This poke spot popped up a mile away us. 

Also seemed like it was a new place since it only had 8 reviews, was SO GLAD I did!

You start off with your selection of fish here, then the onions and jalapeños get tossed into your mixing bowl. Base came next and the selection of toppings. The toppings was a little limited but it more than made up for it because I never really like to fill my bowl anyways. 


Definitely will return again soon!"}
{"text":"As far as Raw ingredients go, this place is as fresh as it gets. The fish is flown in daily from Hawaii. You can definetly tell that it's fresh! (Have a home in maui, visited 6+ times)
I'm very excited for a place like this in chandler, I think it's going to do very well!
The food is really, really good!
I can't express how fresh all of the ingredients tasted.

I was getting my hair cut next door and Just happened to overhear conversations about \"the new healthy food place next door\"
 I'm glad I did!

Make sure and support local business, eat healthy, and try something that isn't too common in this area!"}
{"text":"Love their sushi burrito. It is huge so two people can eat it. I love the variety of toppings and meats. The food is fresh and the customer service is awesome. I did save half for the next day cause I couldn't finish it and it didn't taste good as a leftover, the rice had dried too much."}
{"text":"I felt like the fish wasn't fresh. Won't be back. Try AhiPoke. They are amazing."}
{"text":"So good ! So happy to see all these poke places popping up in Arizona. I got the a bowl half & half - salad and white rice. 3 proteins(portions of the fish can be just a tad bigger I think). I have been to all the poke places in Arizona so far and this one had a little less serving size - other than that it was great! Next time I'll have to try the burrito. Yum yum."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they first opened, and it's still the same (if not better) great flavor. Their sushi burritos and poke bowls are amazing. Large selection of toppings for you to choose from, and when you feel like you're tired of the combination you've been getting, you can change it up and get a whole new, yet still great flavor. 

Since they first opened, they've also added online ordering! So if you're in a rush or want to beat the line, put in your order online and skip the line entirely to pick up your food. 

They've also been voted \"Best Poke\" of Phoenix in 2017 in the Phoenix New Times publication--and rightly so. Hands down my favorite restaurant, and favorite place to get poke at in Arizona. 10/10 recommend.




*word is that they're gonna be opening another location in Uptown Phoenix sometime in the Spring of this year too!"}
{"text":"Pokitrition finally made its way up to Phoenix! And it's just as amazing as their OG location in Chandler! 

If you don't know what Pokitrition is, think chipotle meets poke (raw fish i.e. tuna, salmon, etc). You can choose between a poke burrito, poke bowl, or salad. Choose your base, then your protein, your sauce, and then side toppings. 

I usually get the poke burrito, 2 scoops of salmon, yuzu ponzu sauce on the fish and siracha aioli on the rice. Then I get two scoops of spicy crab, masago, cucumber, mango, and a side of wasabi!

Pokitrition is hands down my favorite restaurant--they've got fresh food and it tastes amazing. 
You best bet I'll be back here on the regular!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Fresh tuna and salmon! The poke wrap was delicious! We came during their grand opening so the wait was 1.5hrs, but it was totally worth it! We even dove all the way from Glendale! Hopefully they decide to open on on the west side of town!"}
{"text":"Really delicious, and fair prices. It is a bit more expensive than comparable meals, but at $10-12 dollars you are getting quite a bit of food. All the staff are super pleasant and very friendly, which is good since the menu is complex."}
{"text":"Easy online ordering, extremely tasty ingredients, affordably priced, kind service - good stuff!"}
{"text":"Feeling #BLESSED to have Pokitrition so close by. I literally screamed when I first came across their \"coming soon\" signs, and when they opened, they did not disappoint! 

The first thing I loved about em was that they fly in their ahi tuna from Hawaii, Honolulu Fish Company to be exact - a ton of points towards freshness and authenticity! Being given the choice of a wrap (sushi burrito) and a bowl is awesome too and helps keep things from getting boring if you want to be a beast and eat poke several times a week!

I had my first taste of the build-your-own-poke bowl last year when ahipoki was the only joint in town. It was really good to me back then up until I had the religious experience of having authentic poke during a trip to Hawaii. Now it doesn't super measure up. Thankfully, with Pokitrition's fresh ingredients, tasty marinades and Honolulu tuna, I can enjoy and reminisce about that real island poke.

Also love that they have a loyalty punch card because I can't fill it up fast enough! Service is fast, friendly and personable- they have often remembered me coming in before :) Plus it always feels good supporting a local AZ-based business in my own neighborhood. See you tomorrow Pokitrition!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome poki place, I'm a fan of poke and this place exceeds my expectations. For sure a place I would be going to again in the future, I recommend sushi burrito with salmon, one scoop spicy crab and seaweed salad. For the toppings I normally take everything they have to offer, they make fantastic topping selections."}
{"text":"To start off I think most of us in the valley are starting to appreciate the poke revolution. Just a short time ago it was new and the options were small. Now that there are more options, it is more of a fair comparison. The setup at Pokitron is more compact than some of its competitors, so it did take some explaining to get my sea legs. Despite my lengthy questioning the staff was very patient and explained all the options. I ended up with a half and half bowl, half salad half rice, with the traditional tuna. The add in choices here are better than other places I've been and the final creation was my favorite poke bowl to date. I will be back, like stalker status...this place is going to get sick of me real quick!"}
{"text":"As my son said - the sushi burrito is solid!   I had a poke bowl and my sons enjoyed the sushi burrito.  The ingredients are so fresh and tasty!  Nice, clean restaurant with a great feel and friendly staff.  We will definitely rerun!"}
{"text":"Craving poke and this place was close to the mall. 

Didnt realize they had sushi burritos out in Chandler so decided to give it a try. 

Best decision ever!

Got the marinated tuna and spicy tuna poke wrap. They have spicy crab mix here, which was pretty cool. Havent seen many places offer that. 

Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"It finally happened!!! I'd been wanting to try Pokitrition since before they opened! I am so so so glad I did. I had a poke bowl with salmon (cause I love salmon) I ordered the half salad, half rice and it was amazing! The salmon and rice were topped with a delicious house made yuzu ponzu sauce, then I added 2 scoops of spicy surimi salad, avocado, sliced jalapeños and sliced red onions. It was so perfect so pretty and while I was eating all I could think about was when was I going to go back to have more of their delicious food."}
{"text":"I went on their first day of the soft opening, so the line was a bit slower than usual, but the food (specifically the fish) is just as good as the Chandler location. The poke bowl concept is everywhere, so the process is the same - pick your base, your protein, your sauces, and your sides. I always go with salmon and the marinated tuna, which has a really smooth texture to it and a nice bite. I have yet to try their sushi burritos, but I've had friends that have ordered it and they're always satisfied with it. They're not skimpy at the Chandler location and I found the same to be the case at this new Phoenix location. Given the choice, I'll always pick Pokitrition over the other places because of the quality and quantity difference. Glad to have a location that's close to my work to satisfy the lunch cravings!"}
{"text":"It was my first time there and my first sushi burrito and it was really good! I came in with a big group but the workers were great~ it was clean and had pretty good variety of drinks to choose from. I got mango green tea for my drink but it was over brewed so it was super bitter. So I told the worker and he apologized and let me switch to mango black tea and it was perfect! Super nice of him. The price was reasonable. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today and really enjoyed my salmon and brown rice bowl. The portions were decent and everything seemed very fresh. They did not have shrimp yet, which would have been my first choice, but I'm looking forward to trying it another time.  I work in that center and the price (base of $9.95) is too steep to go for lunch often, but it's nice to have another option around."}
{"text":"This was my first time having a poke bowl and a poke burrito and this place did not disappoint! 

I'm so glad I made it to their grand opening for the buy one get one (: I was worried they would run out because they did say \"while supplies last\" but I did and my friends and I were part of the few last people they serve. They gave us free swag for baring the burden of telling people behind us to leave which is pretty cool of them. 

I feel like for about 10 bucks you get a lot of food and on top of that, the food is good and fresh! Love the decor of the place, very simple and modern. The staff is extremely friendly and even though they were probably tired from working all day for their grand opening, they were very attentive and did not rush us at all. 

To be honest I was a little scared going there late on their grand opening because I didn't want the leftover scraps but it was nothing like that. 

Definitely will come back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Poke is poke - and we're fortunate to have it expand in Phx - but the burrito is where it's at. 

The fish is high quality, and they have this beat press for the rice. All of the usual condiments included. But something about eating it in burrito form.

Again - the size is awesome, the price fits, and it can be whatever you want it to be. If you were to get an equal roll(s); you'd pay much more.

I'd go light on the sriracha aioli but otherwise - spot on."}
{"text":"Omg yes! I am so happy they opened. What a perfect type of food for th 100 degree weather I'm AZ! This is so refreshing. It will be hard not to spend my Money here"}
{"text":"I saw this place at PHX NIGHT MARKET and decided to give it a try. They have sushirittos. I got a bowl instead and Ichose: marinated ahi tuna, salmon, brown rice, Japanese seasoning, edamame, sea weed salad, spice crab mix, masago, radish, green onions, crispy wontons, sriracha aioli, sesame Shoyu.... the employee accidentally added a sauce I didn't want. Presentation was nice. But flavor was not there. I was looking for a kick of flavor. Even the marinated ahi was BLAND. Can't say I will be coming back. This place is just HYPE for the sushi burrito. But I'm sure that'll be bland too."}
{"text":"I would  have given 5 stars, great customer service and delicious food. I was disappointed on how small the portions are. I had read  on the reviews that portions are large,they use a small ice cream scooper to measure the meat. And yes I have been to plenty of poke places to know the difference in portions.We also had a baby with us and they did not  have high chairs (we where told they had been ordered)"}
{"text":"The options are limited but the fish is fresh. The sauce is better than Ahi-poki (which I think is too salty). I wish they had more options than just salmon or tuna :("}
{"text":"So a bowl of poke salad is about $9.95 for 2 scoops of protein (tuna, salmon, spicy tuna, octopus). Additional scoop is another $1.75. You get 2 toppings (crab and seaweed here). And additional topping is extra (avocado $1 extra). The scoops are smaller than the ice cream ones."}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii I know what poke should taste like and this isn't exactly it, but it's pretty darn close.  I ordered the poke buritto and it was very good.  If ever I'm in the area I'm gonna go back and just construct a hawaiian style poke bowl. Cheee heeee!!"}
{"text":"Best poke that we've had in the Valley. Great customer service as well! 
We got their signature spicy burrito and a poke bowl. The fish was really fresh and all the ingredients were of great quality. The restaurant itself is very clean and well decorated. Loved it!"}
{"text":"This place opened about a month ago down the street from me, and I have had a great experience going here.
First, there may or may not be a line - if so, it generally moves quickly and they will get you on your way. However, the portion sizes are very large. 
I generally like the poke bowl - I have had the \"burrito\"/wrap and it is good too - just another way to eat it. I prefer the bowl though - as the wrap becomes a little harder to eat. 
Anyway - I like the spicy tuna, and the spicy crab is awesome. Love the seaweed salad and the toppings. 
Unlike other places I have been - they are very friendly here and quick to help out. As well - loved that my sushi rice was still warm (as opposed to other places where I have had dried out crunchy rice) and I love the shoyu sauce. 
Overall - very easy concept and delicious."}
{"text":"PLEASE DONT BE SCARED OF THIS PLACE!! The food is phenomenal and the customer service is twice as great! Everyone is welcoming and engaging. I ordered a tuna bowl on brown rice with mango, crab salad and avocado and actually INHALED the food. It is definitely worth coming you you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This is THE place to get sushi burritos! It's definitely a one of a kind place in Arizona. Everything tastes so fresh. The restaurant is always clean. The staff is super friendly and quick to make your order. (Shoutout to Pauline for making me the best sushi burrito ever!) I also love that they do stamp cards because we'll keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of sushi but I love their salads and I add crab. Everything always tastes fresh. So good!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to Poke! Pokitrition is close to work so it makes this location convenient. The fish is always fresh and the toppings are great. (The mango sounds weird but is fantastic!) I like their Ponzu & Aioli combined which makes for a great sauce.  I've only ever had the poke bowl, just because I want EVERY topping and think it would just be too much to roll in a burrito. Couple things I wish, is that they would maybe offer another fish option. (yellowtail, octopus, etc) and the wasabi. They are getting better with it, but it's a tiny little bit in a cup you have to request when paying. (super tiny... like silly tiny amount) I can't imagine wasabi is too expensive, put it in line with the toppings and let me get a good kick in my bowl too.  Overall it's a great place and worth a try."}
{"text":"Dude, SUSHI BURRITO. It's so amazing. Big and filling too. Servers are always fast and friendly here."}
{"text":"Just stopped in and had the BEST experience! Everyone was so helpful and you can tell the fish was fresh. I had a wrap and could only finish half. So awesome! Keep it up Pokitrition"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy!  I love the idea of a sushi burrito!  The ingredients were amazing and you could pick what you wanted in your burrito."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at the restaurant. The guy at the counter explained that you order like chipotle. I started creating my bowl and chose the spicy ahi and the marinated ahi. Luckily before I finished ordering the person behind me asked what the marinade was. I'm highly allergic to nuts and would have no way of knowing that the ahi was marinated in nuts had the person behind me not asked. Nut allergies are extremely common and are normally noted on the menu because of the severe reaction people who are allergic have. The restaurant had plenty of signs for uncooked fish illness. There should definitely be something that says marinated in nuts. I created a new bowl that was nut free but I'm concerned about cross contamination because there set up wasn't the cleanest."}
{"text":"I love raw fish! Moving back from Hawaii to AZ, i thought I wouldn't be able to enjoy a \"spicy ahi don\" (spicy raw tuna bowl) here in the desert. But a Chandler friend insisted that Poktrition was a quick fix for my Poke withdrawal. It was like a raw fish Chipotle. You get a bowl or wrap (large hand roll) with rice, protein (raw salmon or ahi), and your choice of add-ins. It was FRESH and tasty, but i did feel jipped on the rice (I got the bowl), and felt it was over-priced ($17?!) I ordered salmon, spicy ahi, guac, seaweed salad, edemame and crunchy onion...Maybe i got too much \"mush\", but i felt it needed a better texture than mush. I just need more RICE! Which is why I will update this WHEN I go back. Hopefully the wrap will sooth the Poke handroll fix, or I will have to ask for more rice in the bowl. It's good, and worth another chance."}
{"text":"Entire staff is always friendly and welcoming! Good poke is hard to find in Arizona, especially after living in Hawaii for a few years! Finally came across this place and their food is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!  First time having poke...super clean, staff was helpful and charming.  The space is small but very inviting. Met the owner who seemed super excited about the service they were offering the public...Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Yum.  Cool new place with yummy food.  Loved the flavors.  Name is weird, but dont let it deter you from checking this place out."}
{"text":"Modern and sleek interior. Nothing that will distract you from what truly matters... The food. The assembly area was clean and very functional for the staff. My husband and I got the wraps and OMG they were amazing and filling. We will be back again!
The fish was fresh and the toppings added taste bud tickling flavors. I am a happy chocolate girl for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pokitrition a few times now, and they have consistently provided quality and flavorful poke bowls and sushi burritos.  They're always friendly and portion size is decent for the price."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time a week ago! I LOVE how large the burritos are for the price! Good quality! You get to choose your toppings and they make it right in front of you! I would love to see a larger variety of drinks available, however."}
{"text":"So yummy! Hits the spot when you want poke. Service is great! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"My first time having Poke. The spicy tuna was really good. Easy to order, will be back. The restaurant itself is pretty small so I grabbed mine to go, but very clean & simple decor. I love how they offered cups of water, always a plus. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Will be back."}
{"text":"This place is worth so many more stars than just 5! I have not stopped ranting raving about it, since I have been! Great service, so quick, amazing wrap! Will be back next week! New favorite place!"}
{"text":"This spot was just ok. A little pricey for the amount of food they give you. I've had a few poke spots and I wasn't that impressed by this one."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to give this place a try. It's been hard to find a good and fresh Poke place around here.  The staff was very friendly and helpful (I was a little bit lost at first in how to offer but the gal was super friendly and patient with me). My poke bowl was super delicious and I could taste the freshness of it. Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place has really delicious poke bowls. It always tastes fresh! They are always so friendly and have quick, accurate service! It is perfect for a nice, healthy lunch!"}
{"text":"In the time of \"choose your own,\" I can see the appeal to this style of fast food. Growing up in Hawaii, poke has always been prepared in a certain manner by a chef or a mom or uncle, where you are tasting what they think it's good. When you make it yourself, you control what you put in and deal with the consequences, as with all experimentations. This halfway in the middle approach in which this establishment tries to achieve, falls short. Pick your own sauce and combination works well for ice cream and maybe sandwiches, but not poke. Additionally, the bowls are small, and even smaller are the amount of fish you get. 

Do yourselves a favor and head down the road to the other poke place. They do it better, a bit closer to Hawaii, at least"}
{"text":"I always feel very healthy after eating here because of the freshness of ingredients and clean sauces. The marinated tuna has a wonderful taste and texture!

They have a hip vibe and a bunch of products and drinks I've never seen before. Teas are real teas and realll good, and just sugar and fruit flavor. They even have infused cucumber water!

Plus it's right off of Ray and the 101 so it's super convenient to get my poke fix.  What more can a foodie ask for?!"}
{"text":"2 Stars on yelp is defined as \"Meh, I've experienced better\"

That's about all I can say.

Ahi Poke and Poke Eats are better than this place, and here is why:
Bigger servings, better options, and better environment.

Poketrition gives you the smallest servings of all the new poke shops in town, the bowls are pretty petite. You can and will eat a lot more at poke eats or ahi poke. Poketrition is not by any means a comfortable sit-down place, 99% of the time you will take it to go because it's small and cramped. This is not a big deal, but having room to sit and breathe is nice, it never hurt anyone...once again this is not a problem at the others.

Last gripe is their water situation, they have a tiny un-chilled crock of nasty cucumber water in the back of the restaurant with tiny dixie cups, it's either that or buy a Dasani. Just let people have water from the machine like everyone else please.

Competition is good and healthy, the more poke shops the merrier, but I don't see the big deal about poketrition, it never wowed and never lingered, and the servings are little. Kudos and good luck to the owners though, nothing wrong with having several options for consumers.

But for real, say no to that gross cucumber water."}
{"text":"We so are lucky that this is our neighborhood Poke place! Bowls are fresh, tasty, and super filling. They do not skimp on fish or toppings! Staff is always helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Most likely my favorite Poke place in the valley outside of yours truly (Mac's Kitchen ) The staff is so friendly and attentive and the flavors are perfect. Even though there isn't an array of protein options, they have just enough and it's all fresh. You must have the house special marinated tuna and spicy crab salad, they are amazing! Don't forget the mango and watermelon radish toppings you will not be disappointed. I still have to go back and try the poke wrap which looks absolutely satisfying and more than filling. You just can't go wrong here. The only downside for me is that they are only in Chandler and I am in the west valley so my visits aren't often. Nonetheless an absolute treat every time I have the opportunity to oblige. Just look at the detail and make some time to check out these friendly folks at Pokitrition... Mac 5 star approved!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved here from CA and this is our favorite poke spot in AZ! The staff is amazing and always fun to talk to and the manager (or owner) himself is a pretty cool dude. Always super fresh fish and fat side scoops"}
{"text":"Fresh fish and flavorful sauces. Love this place, as it is consistent, quick and great service. 
I've seen people go in for the first time and they let ok totally lost or even intimidated on how to order. The staff is always very polite and patient, helping the newbies build a tasty poke bowl."}
{"text":"I 100% can't get enough of this place. The customer service is phenomenal! They always greet me with big smiles on their faces. Plus they remember me every time I come in. 
Their options of toppings are always fresh and available to customize your order. I've never had a mistake on my order happen which is great because I'm such a picky eater! 
Definitely come to this place if you're looking for a fun environment to have a great snack or meal!"}
{"text":"Just went for the first time and it is fantastic! Great was to have a sushami burrito or bowl.  Definitely a must try for sushi lovers alike.  Staff is fast & friendly."}
{"text":"Great fast food for raw fish.  Lots of choices, bowls are large.
I wish they were closer, I would be over often."}
{"text":"This place was really good! I had the wrap! I think the service was 5+. The food was really fresh. It just missing something, not sure what. I will go again to see if I can change it up and get something more taste. I was going to give them 5 stars but there competitors Chula seafood in Scottsdale had the same concept but there flavors were just a little better. To next time"}
{"text":"So excited that I finally get to try this place. My friend and I walked in and the staff already seem so nice and welcoming. It was my first time and the girl seem very helpful and friendly. Unfortunately I didn't catch her name. 

I got their sushi burrito wrap and it's the best thing ever! This creation is so cool. Raw fish tasted very fresh, their sauces is the best and the wrap itself is very big. It can be share for two if you dont eat allot. 

Anyways I would definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Completely addicted. The staff is super friendly and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite poke place! Everything is absolutely delicious, fresh, and the flavors/sauces/sides complement each other so perfectly. The bowls are great, but I recently tried the sushi burritos, and they are amazing! I definitely recommend this place if you're thinking about trying poke, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Love this place but ordering online isnt worth it. Waiting in line is faster. Ordered it early, waiting 20 minutes past the ready time.... not a happy camper"}
{"text":"Wow! This place rocks, I went in with some friends last weekend and this place is phenomenal! 

I had a bowl with tuna and salmon which were both fresh and apparently are flown in daily from Hawaii, super cool. The staff was really helpful in recommending what toppings to put in my bowl and it all turned out great. 

The prices are good, I can't wait to go back once they have their grand opening and try their wrap in addition to the bowls."}
{"text":"I can see why this place has 5 out of 5 stars right now. First time we had poke and we chose this place over other places in the are as the make the poke rep, over just having it an bowl. We had the salmon and it tasted really fresh."}
{"text":"Still trying to understand what I just experienced..  The place smells like a pet store for starters.  Fish shouldn't have a super fishy smell and what I had did.  They dont really have salad dressing for the salad. It's pretty much just everything that a sushi roll has on it.  I had the aioli and it was good but if I'm there for a salad, I don't want to smother it in mayo. Staff was nice.  I'd call this a chipotle clone but with 3 day old fish and less options.  Also, no alcohol so that is a 'never again'."}
{"text":"I'm completely obsessed with their marinated tuna. The food is fresh, portions and prices are reasonable, and staff is quick and friendly. Looking forward to the new Central PHX location opening."}
{"text":"It's finally my turn to check out the Poke craze after seeing everyone's yummy posts. My friend  picked this place to eat at one afternoon because she heard great things. My first thought was subway but for sushi. But as I got closer to the ordering area, it became more than that. The theme is eat healthy, eat local and eat raw. The staff was great at welcoming us and helping us with the ordering process. Pokitrition was started by ASU grads (WooHoo... Go Devils) and they serve Hawaiian inspired sushi bowls and burritos that you customize yourself. You can choose from salmon, ahi, spicy tuna and cooked shrimp for your protein. Then you have a base (salad or rice) and toppings you can add to complete your meal. Lol... I think I picked every topping available just to experience it all. The bowl was supper fresh, light and delicious. I was pretty blown away by all the flavors. Even my buddy who is super picky went for the octopus and loved it. I really enjoyed my first time trying poke and would come back again. Here's to new experiences!"}
{"text":"The poke is bomb! The Cheetos sushi burritos were very good but on the pictures it shows that they get rolled in hot cheetos but they just sprinkle very little on the inside."}
{"text":"I've tried sushiburrito places in Cali and Vegas before and they were delicious. The first time I came here it wasn't bad but just okay. I didn't think their yuzu sauce and mango chunks were as acidic as I wanted them to be so the burrito was just a little too subtle for me.

I gave it another try and I'm so glad I did. I just really liked the yuzu sauce way more this time and they really mixed it in with the salmon and tuna I ordered as the protein.

I ordered so much on my wrap I almost thought they wouldn't be able to wrap it but they did! 

BTW avocado is $1 extra!"}
{"text":"This is hands-down the best Poki Bowl I've had in the valley. The fish is always fresh, the staff is always friendly and helpful and the servings are the best! Thank you for the best value and amazing food! Thank you Justin!"}
{"text":"Freshly made to order bowls and rolls. Colorful presentation. The various ingredients in the bowl brought a balancing taste and surprising texture.
Fast and friendly service! A must go eatery in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Am a big fan of poke and the other Poke restaurant in Chandler, so I was anxious to try Pokitrition. Wow! It did not disappoint! I ordered a wrap, my first time trying one and it was a huge bite of deliciousness! I had salmon, spicy tuna, red onions, cilantro, green onions, both spicy and regular crab salad, furikake and fried onions to finish. It tasted so fresh and the price to portion ratio was ideal! Can't wait to come back with my daughter to share this excellent food experience! Left completely stuffed and in a glorious food coma."}
{"text":"I am so happy that there is a great poke place right off the 101 in Chandler. The food is fresh and they have great options. I have never tried a sushi burrito but the bowls are great!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the counter by the register is always dirty and sometimes the service can be a little \"flighty\". Besides those, everything else is fantastic."}
{"text":"I consider myself a Poke connoisseur at this point.  I gave Pokitrition a shot when they first opened and the first time I walked in the door I was blasted with an awful smell of fish.  Good fish should not smell.  I had my bowl, was not impressed and I wrote the place off.  Today needed a quick lunch and was in the area and decided to give them another chance.  Walked in, same awful fish smell.  And this time my salmon tastes fishy too.  With the wonderful poke places opening in the valley, this place should really reconsider their business plan.  They have way less ingredient options from the other pokes places too.  Definitely off my list for good."}
{"text":"Ahh gotta love the Poke craze! Pokitrition is quick and straight to the point which makes for excellent lunch stops when you are in a rush. They have a simple menu which means the line moves smoothly so why not the extra star? To be honest I was expecting more of a selection of toppings, sides and proteins add a few more options and this place will earn a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place was on point.  Great value - I somehow managed to have enough food for leftovers which kept surprisingly well.  Tasty food.  REALLY great staff - I was pleasantly surprised with how they were able to help me through the process and make recommendations.  They were happy and attentive.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Favorite new place to get a quick sushi fix. The ingredients were incredibly fresh and it's nice to pick whatever you want in your roll. I went there with a coworker and was blown away... so I took my whole family back and we all walked away happy. Planning frequent visits to Pokitrition!"}
{"text":"So Good! I've waiting for a place like this to come to AZ! Now it's here! Sushi burrito! Loving it!"}
{"text":"So fresh and tasty. The first thing I said when I walked in was, \"it's like a sushi chipotle\"!!"}
{"text":"Drove an hour to try it out. Absolutely delicious. Only wish the burrito was bigger for the price"}
{"text":"Love this place! By far the best tasting I have been to.  Loved the wrap aka burrito.  The staff is super friendly and know the product well to answers all of my questions.  Bring it closer to home in Gilbert please."}
{"text":"Obsessed. Food and service are excellent. A guilt-free, fresh and filling meal!"}
{"text":"The parking during lunch hour was a bit tough but so worth it. The fish was fresh, the sesame shoyu sauce tasty but not overpowering. Thw surimi crab was good, but I always would prefer real crab. My only complaint is that they are pretty light on the masago, even when you ask for extra (although I would happily take the entire bowl so.....) This place is a drive for me but oh so worth it. Will definitely be back to try the \"wrap\" which looks like a giant sushi roll."}
{"text":"Pretty fresh ahi tuna for Arizona and larger portions then most poke places, I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"5 stars for Pokitrition! Best poke restaurant in Arizona. The sushi wrap was amazing, basically a sushi burrito  but better! If you love fresh fish and sushi, you will love this place. I hope they add more locations, preferably the North Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"zipped in for a late quick dinner. I had the poke wrap, aka sushi burrito. I had originally planned on saving half for later-NEWP, didnt happen, it was just too good. In fact , I dreamed about it for the rest of the evening. I will be back soon. omg so good and fresh!

Super friendly, courteous staff.

Super clean.
yum.=)"}
{"text":"Since my last review on a poke bowl place, I refused to waste another $ amount here in Arizona. I wanted to simply invest my $ on something well worth it. Which means, on another trip to California.... BUT!!! 

I was recommended by a friend to try Pokitrition. It's new so the place was very clean, style is modern, and very well lit. It was our first time, so the staff gave us a run down on how to order at their location. The toppings are not a huge selection, but they were fresh and their sauce options actually tasted amazing! Each cube I bit into were so flavorful and soft. AND GET THIS. The spicy tuna was actually SPICY and the flavors of my bowl blended so beautifully together that I could hear the song \"Ave Maria\" play in my head with each slow and savory bite. 

They only had one size bowl, I think. As the price was $9.95 for 2 selections of fish. It would have been nice if there were a small, medium, and large option. However, the current size made my piggy self full after eating about 3/4 of it and my brother had to put his in the fridge for a short break.

Hallelujah! Finally....... I found a place to satisfy my poke bowl cravings. Btw, I heard from a little bird that their fish was so fresh, that it flies in from Hawaii daily. I will definitely be eating here, A LOT."}
{"text":"I'm in love with the poke burrito and it is some of the freshest poke that you will find in the valley.

First off, the Poke craze has taken over AZ and everyone is coming in to the market. I wasn't sure this would be better or the same as the competitors but oh my goodness, this takes the cake!

I went on their grand opening day but have gone back several times because of how amazing their food is.

You can choose a bowl or a wrap which is great. All their fish is flown in fresh daily from Honolulu and you can taste the difference. I have had some of the poke from local locations and the fish is generally frozen first and then thawed. NOT THIS PLACE, IT IS SO FRESH!!! 

They have a machine that flattens out their rice to make an easy to assemble wrap. They offer a guacamole house spread on the wrap and I'm letting you know, this makes it even better! As you go through, you choose how many scoops of fish to add, vegetables and little extras. This is the only place that I know that offers watermelon radish and it is amazing. They also have watermelon juice for sale. The wrap was the most perfect wrap I have ever had and some of the freshest fish to boot!

The restaurant is small but there is usually enough seating for everyone. Tons of free parking and a wonderful addition to the area. 

I highly recommend that you try this place, even if the name is a pun on words, you will love it!"}
{"text":"Great local spot for poke that is fresh and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. I stop in frequently for a healthy lunch alternative. My only gripes are that it takes a little while in line even when they're not too busy, and some lower-priced drink options would be nice."}
{"text":"I moved here a few months ago and my poke cravings are so real after living in the bay (which has a million poke places) and I'd say this is a solid place. I have had their burrito as well as the bowl and personally the bowl is much better. My only complaint is the variety of options for sides , toppings and protein. Still when I am craving poke this is my to go spot"}
{"text":"Very good poke bowl place! I am addicted to poke bowls and have been to a few around the valley and this is a very good one! A bit pricey- as poke bowls usually are- it will come out to about $12-13 without a drink, $15 with. But definitely worth it. The spicy crab is amazing and the rice is not too dry and the salad tasted good. Also try their teas. The black tea is the perfect amount of sweetnesss. So good."}
{"text":"I swear these poke places just keep getting better!!! I looooved Poketrition because they have the option to not only get a bowl, but also a burrito style poke wrap. 

The wrap is seaweed and rice, and they put a really yummy seasoning on it. I added tuna, sweet and spicy sauce, crab mix, onions, edemame, roe, watermelon radish, cucumber, and wontons. The wontons gave the wrap a really great texture! 

The staff was super friendly also! They made sure we understood the process and all of our options. What's great is that they have a cali-style option where you can skip the main protein and still get everything else, which I think is a nice touch! They have lots of yummy, healthy drinks as well.

This is probably my new favorite poke place! Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"My new favorite poke place. The fish is very high quality and they offer a variety of toppings, sides, and dressings. The rice seasoning is amazing and takes it to a whole new level. The service is also very friendly and the prices are reasonable. I have yet to try the sushi burrito but I plan on it soon."}
{"text":"It was good but didn't wow me as I had hoped.    It was crowded inside, loud so you had to yell so the person behind the counter could hear me.   I don't like that.   Menu was a little confusing.   But asking a question was not easy.    I'm not sure I'll return again."}
{"text":"So delicious!  They are always speedy with their service, and the food always tastes fresh.  If you've never tried the wrap, you have to have it at least once.  I usually get the bowl, though, because the wrap is just too much food for me.  They have a great selection of toppings and the portions are generous.  You can mix and match sauces, too, for some great flavor combinations.  We've tried a few different poke bowl places around the valley, and this is definitely our favorite."}
{"text":"Great quality seafood.They are buying really high quality fish and it shows. One of the few places in the valley I trust for seafood."}
{"text":"Best poke place in town. I love getting a wrap there. Everything is so fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"I've never had the poké bowl here, but since it is the same ingredients as the \"burrito\", I'd says it's pretty good quality and tastes fresh. The sushi burrito is definitely something else, in a good way. Kinda can get messy, but tastes really good. Decently price as well, about $10 for one. Fast service."}
{"text":"I am going to go on record by saying I have never tried poke before.  Many have raved, few have tried ... and I have to say, it was incredibly delicious.  But what you don't understand is it is also incredibly filling.  I ordered a wrap and customized it with my eyes (I didn't know what I was going for, I just put stuff on based on what I thought I would like) ... but it was satisfying!  Next time I'm going for a 1/2 rice/salad bowl!  Staff is super friendly and would love to help explain it to other newbies.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The staff are so helpful and really know the product. Everything is super fresh, great taste and the cold brew, Yum!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to leave a review. I have been here a couple of times now and I am not disappointed! The staff is super friendly and the food is great. I always get the sushi wrap (burrito) with spicy tuna, salmon, spicy crab, and whatever topping I feel like stuffing inside that day haha. The only issue I have, which isn't a big deal, is I wish there was a bit more rice and tougher seaweed to hold the burrito together better. It would also help break up textures a little bit more as sometimes it just get pretty mushy. But the flavor is there, and it's amazing. I come here a couple of times a month now with friends and they all enjoy it too :)"}
{"text":"These type places seem to be popping up all over these days, and they are all similar, with similar prices and features. 

This one's decent as well, but I have to say that, so far, Poke Bowl (the original, I believe) still edges it out. 

Even so, good for a healthy, tasty lunch at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is very fresh and you get to build your own bowl. The serving size was large - I couldn't even finish my bowl.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Someone else said, \"I can't stop thinking about this place!\"  And I absolutely agree!  I went there yesterday and completely understand.  It is FRESH food, amazing ingredients and that perfectly satisfying mix of food textures and flavors combined in a bowl!  AWESOME! I live in CA and am here in AZ just this week.  plan to go back tomorrow to get my fix until my next visit.  

LINE out the DOOR on THURSDAY EVE. so be prepared to wait, but certainly worth it!  Line moved quickly too! 

STAFF were impressive, let them help you decide.  They helped me and their suggestions were fantastic!  I think the owners are even behind the counter working, that's the enthusiasm and delight I felt from the team.  

Bravo!"}
{"text":"Best Poke around!  If you are a fan of Sushi and the style of eating such as Chipotle, this is your place!  After my first visit, I was hooked!!  Expect to pay just under $10 a bowl (Avocado $1 extra).  I never think it will fill me up, but it absolutely always does.  I prefer the bowl over the burrito, but all my friends LOVE the burrito.  

Now here is what I order 98% of the time: 
White Rice Bowl w/ Furi kakke 
Marinated Tuna and Salmon
Shoyu and Ponzu Sauce (Also put some on the rice)
Sea Weed Salad, Mango, Spicy crab, edamame, Masago, Avocado
Sesame seeds & wonton chips.

awww man, I think I need to go after writing this review now!"}
{"text":"My favorite poke spot in Arizona. Their staff is ALWAYS kind and welcoming. The serving sizes for their bowls and the sushi burritos are perfect. The burrito is a perfect size for me because it never feels like I've ordered too much. One main reason this place is my favorite is because they offer some \"game changing\" toppings that you dont find at a lot of their competitors. Those toppings being cilantro, mango, and watermelon radish. Add any of these to your meal and you wont be disappointed. They also have the best drink selection compared to their competitors including some delicious mango black tea that I just love."}
{"text":"Wow what a great concept health fast food..
Totally loving it.
You can make your own sushi roll or rice bowl with fresh raw fish.."}
{"text":"Fresh new concept and totally delicious.   Like how they've got a loyalty program.  Friendly service as well.   I hope to become a regular here."}
{"text":"This is the first time I ate this place, it very yummy and the tuna and the salmon are really big. Me and my sister love that place and will come back for more"}
{"text":"This place was quick, delicious, and left us with happy feelings! This place does not provide the full sit down restaurant ambiance but compares more to how you would order and eat at chipotle. You order either a poke bowl or wrap (which is like a sushi burrito and is so flavorful) the worker adds the ingredients you ask for and makes it in front of you. They have a really cool machine that flattens the rice on seaweed to wrap up your poke! They have so many options! I choose a wrap with ahi tuna, salmon, with crab, seaweed salad, siracha aioli, cucumber, watermelon radish, edamame, and wontons! The wontons added the crunchy factor that took it to the next level! I recommend it! We also got a tea which was delicious as well! Cute on the inside, not very big, but we ordered got our food quick, sat and ate! Now that I'm moving closer to chandler I will definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"We wanted to go for their grand opening and thank goodness we didn't! Lines were around the corner! So a day or two after the grand opening, we decided to go. OMG! Love this place. It's quite tiny inside tho so didn't seem like a good idea to stay to eat. We ordered 2 burritos to go. It's kind of like a Chipotle in that you order what you want as you go down the line. Not a ton of choices here but still good just the same. We had the marinated tuna with crab meat and seaweed salad. So good we are ready to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Really good! The burrito is yummy but for the price, I feel that you get more food with the bowl. Either way, yummy and fresh. Gets crowded for lunch"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating poke and let's just say I fell in love at first sight. 

It's just like chipotle, but better. Yes, call me a heathen, but I won't take it back. Essentially, you pick what kind of medium you want your piece of heaven (sushirito, salad, or bowl) and you pick your main meat, your seasoning, and then toppings. I went with the Yuzu Salmon Bowl and I loved every bite. The ingredients were fresh, even the salmon even though Arizona is a land locked state. I am a firm believer that we eat food with our eyes. The poki bowl was delicious but also beautiful in color and arrangement. The gentleman who created my bowl put lots of care into its creation and I was thoroughly pleased. The lads behind the counter are extremely courteous and patient. Bottom line, I'll be back whenever I find myself in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love poke and I was excited to try this new poke restaurant that is, for me, conveniently located.  When I arrived,  the staff was attentive and greeted me with a smile.  They asked if I had ever had poke before,  which is a big deal of you're new to the poke experience.  The food was plentiful and fresh.  I do wish they had more sauce options which is why I gave a four instead of a five. They're price point of $10 is on mark with other poke restaurants.  Some may think that's expensive,  but I think it's a value when you consider the quality of food you get."}
{"text":"I only go here for the poke wraps AKA sushi burritos. They're so good 

They also have a stamp card. I'm halfway through mine xD"}
{"text":"With so many poke joints opening up all over the valley, I have to say this place is my absolute favorite! I definitely encourage you to come here if you haven't tried poke before. I've recommended this place to friends, family, and co workers and they all ended up getting hooked. Everything is sold at a reasonable price and their ingredients always look/taste fresh. I usually get a poke wrap with the marinated tuna, along with their mango black tea. It's AMAZING! The staff is always so friendly and energetic, there's never been a time where I received poor customer service. They're also very accommodating and willing to answer all your questions. 

Nothing can compare to this place! :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite poke place! Their ahi and salmon is so fresh and sauces are amazing."}
{"text":"My very favorite place in AZ! I go their every weekend and can't stop loving this place. Their meat is fresh and their seasonings are outstanding. Portion size is large, and people work there are very friendly. I highly recommend this place to seafood lovers out there."}
{"text":"I frequently go to Pokitrition for lunch because of the quality of the food and the great service. The people working are extremely friendly and will take the chance to know you when you're ordering and checking out. I normally order the salmon and the spicy tuna. Every time I order those, it tastes fresh. 

Pokitrition is similar to a Chipotle in a sense that your order goes down the line and the employees put your choice of toppings. They are very efficient when creating your bowl or burrito."}
{"text":"Very tasty sushi wraps ordered and made \"Subway\" style, order ingredients and watch them get rolled into a seaweed wrap (or into a bowl). The folks behind the counter were quick with the food and a welcoming smile. This won't replace my favorite Sushi place but I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Poke bowls are my new passion. :) This place is nice, good quality food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I ordered a wrap. The employee who made my beautiful masterpiece, Andrew (I think that was his name) handled the process with the most professional manner. Not only was he generous with the portion sizes, but he arranged each and every piece of my wrap beautifully. When faced with the daunting task of rolling the entire bad boy up, he rolled up his sleeves and assured me not to worry. A true hero that we all need, but don't deserve. A very accommodating host, Andrew should definitely receive praise as well as promotion for his revolutionary service for he created a true masterpiece. Andrew truly placed every component and ingredient into the wrap as if they were his own children. The most enjoyable part of it all was the experience of Andrews flavors exploding into my mouth and being able to taste each and every flavor of andrew's children as the intense sensation flooded every part of my pallet. A truly sensational dish and an experience I will never forget. Thank you, andrew."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the salmon poke wrap and it was way better than the poke I found I San Diego. Definitely a must-go for sushi lovers alike."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite poke shop. It always taste fresh here and the staff are all friendly and welcoming plus knowledgeable. Did I mention the decor is on point as well!"}
{"text":"Whatever ASU grads do, they do it better. GO DEVILS!!!  Seriously though. I have been to a lot of poke joints the last six months and they do it the best here. Better assortment of fish and ingredients. Impeccably fresh and reasonably priced. What's not to love."}
{"text":"There's a lot of poke places & this experience isn't worth coming back? Nearly all my reviews are 5 stars too... 

I eat a LOT of poke from many locations but ordering here was really unpleasant... everything had to be repeated multiple times. She spoke perfect English too just couldn't communicate. The counter didn't even look clean where they were making bowls - crumbs were all over it. The cashier couldn't remember how to log in. They don't take Amex. The bathroom had no soap. The napkins were torn. There's the main trash can blocking the main entry/exit. 
It was all a really weird experience. 

Sushi burrito was pretty tasty. I like how the avocado is mashed up."}
{"text":"Found this spot on yelp. Needed to meet a business associate for a quick lunch. Hidden gem tucked in the corner of a small shopping plaza. All the ingredients were fresh and the bowl was really easy to make. Not a lot of seating. I can't wait to go back and try Poki in a Wrap. Definitely gonna add this to my weekly lunch destinations."}
{"text":"Excellent wraps!!!!! Super fresh and yummy. We went twice in 1 week because it was so good! I love the seaweed salad, too! And that you can choose whatever you'd like inside. Also, I've tried the green tea and the peach black tea and they were both really good! We love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Just recently had a baby and was craving poki throughout my pregnancy that and many other foods I couldnt eat, my neighbor told me about this place and its a great spot for you to fill your poki craving. I will be returning and taking something home."}
{"text":"Never had a poke bowl before.  We decided to give it a try.  The staff was very helpful,  and the food was delicious.  I opted for the bowl & my hubby had the wrap. We will definitely be back to try different options."}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite joints to eat at when I'm in Arizona. The Poke is fresh and delicious. The sushi burrito was something new to me and I really enjoyed it. I definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I like the concept and the workers are very nice! Cons: the imitation crab meat and there is something about seeing sushi packed into plastic bins and then scooped out into a bowl or sushi wrap. The sushi is just ok. I guess I expect high quality sushi. I don't like to play around with raw fish. So I'm going to keep my high expectations. Will I be back....maybe?!"}
{"text":"So good love the poké wrap adds more flavor and is just amazing. Very filling as well. I give them a 10/10!"}
{"text":"I just ordered a poke wrap for the 1st time, it was a to go order. The staff was friendly and the guy that was building my wrap was giving me his recommendations on what will go better with my meat choices. I really enjoyed my poke wrap, it had a nice crunch and spice. Very quick service too. I'll be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I love poke! I feel in love with it in NYC. This place is one of the best places to get fresh and authentic poke bowls. I am thrilled it is in Chandler! YUM ME"}
{"text":"Have you ever been to one of those places where after you ate your meal you kept thinking about how good it was all day long and wishing you had more of it when it wore off? To me, this is one of those places. 

I was intrigued as soon as I walked in and liked the setup where you choose your ingredients and watch them make your order right in front of you. You could choose a bowl or a wrap. I liked the looks of the wraps other people were getting so I chose that. They're all the same price not including add-ons so that made the choosing easy because I didn't have to consider whether one was more or less expensive. 

The choices were wonderful. You start with two proteins. I chose salmon and shrimp although I'm sure I would have been happy with anything they offered. Other add-in choices include sides, toppings, sauces, all of which are integrated into the bowl or wrap, not set on the side. I would have gotten avocado but it was $1.75 extra and I felt like that upped the price a little more than I wanted.  One of the sides was shredded crab and it was a perfectly delicious choice. 

If I were going to tweak it at all it would have been to ask for a little more cilantro since I love it. And I had no idea what the three sauces tasted like so I just had to pick one randomly. I didn't want something too spicy 
and just did an eenie meenie miney moe between the other two choices. I don't know whether they offer samples but if they do that might have helped. The place was pretty crazy busy on a Saturday afternoon about 1 p.m. so I didn't want to make anyone behind me wait in line while I took too long to make my choices.  When I looked at everything they offered I think there would have been no way I could have ended up with something I wouldn't have liked even if I had told them to put whatever they wanted on it. 

The wrap looked so huge at the end that I was only planning on eating half of it and taking the other half with me to eat later. That just didn't happen. It was so scrumptious and went down so easily that when I finished the first half I moved on to the other half without a second thought. I wasn't sorry. I can always go back, and I plan to. 

The employees were super nice, greeted me in spite of being busy, cheerfully responded to my questions and choices, told me to enjoy and checked if I had enjoyed the wrap as I left. They showed genuine interest in happy customers. That's how it should be but some places you feel like the server is just being nice to you for a good tip, like we can't tell the difference between real interest and phony niceness.

The total price of the wrap was about $11 with tax, but it was as huge as a large burrito so I felt that it was well worth it, not to mention the great quality of the ingredients which made every bite a taste delight.  They don't skimp on the quantity either. I don't know what the nutritional information would be on it, something I might want to look up, but I felt like I got a good portion of protein and greens by the end. It was wrapped in seaweed like a sushi roll but much easier to eat. The seaweed was very tender, not chewy like some sushi.

I'm definitely hooked."}
{"text":"I've been trying all of the poke shops that have been popping up in the East Valley. This one probably still ranks at the top- It seems to be the freshest and the the flavors of everything are awesome. I love how they mix the fish with the sauce, separately, I feel like this really adds to the taste. The only cons I've found is they have totally changed their portion sizes since they opened - in particular really skimping on rice, and it's just not as filling as It used to be. The miso soup is worth It for $1.50, the iced tea not so much (sickeningly sweet). I'll be keep my eye out on new shops popping up but will continue to be semi-regular at this one, for now!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner by myself when traveling out of town. Very friendly staff with a \"can do\" attitude. Food is fresh and tasty. Portion sizes are adequate and reasonably priced. I would definitely go back here again. There is ample seating. The ordering process seemed a bit cumbersome/unclear to me but it could just be that I wasn't used to their process being a first timer there. 5/5!"}
{"text":"Sushi burritos are always a yes in my book. I wish these were a little bigger but they were still good! I ate the whole thing and could've eaten more. I also didn't realize when I ordered the Salmon that it was smoked but that was okay. They also have to stamp cards so you can work your way toward a free one! The drink options here are limited to pre-packaged drinks only. They didn't serve fountain drinks here, but they had a thing of cucumber water to serve yourself."}
{"text":"Food: Delish! Got a sushirrito with shoyu ahi and spicy ahi. The guy who made my roll was so nice and accommodating--he made me a brown rice burrito per request even tho it's usually made with only white rice!

Price: Appropriate 

Atmosphere: Modern and trendy

Service: Excellent 

I signed up with a point system so I'll def be back! :)"}
{"text":"First time coming here, saw it on yelp.  Had to try the sushirito.  I did the salmon and spicy tuna with crab salad cucumber and edamame with mild chipotle dressing and toasted sesame seeds. And a honey green tea. It was so good and filling but not over doing it, if you know what I mean. I would definitely come back. The staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"Sushi burritos are where it's at... Awesome quick service... You get to bullshit and joke with the crew there... Really great place it's a must... They fucken do a good job and great eats!"}
{"text":"The best and freshest Poké in the valley. Definitely worth every bite and dollar to make the trek over. Wonderful staff to meet your needs, knowledgeable and quality oriented. Each their own artist to help you make your delicious creation. 10 out of 10 recommend the marinated tuna and regular tuna with a combination yuzu and shoyu sauce. Chances are the shipment of fresh tuna just came in and someone is cutting it up in the back to replenish what you get."}
{"text":"I'm sorry I just don't get all the great reviews of this place. I've had a lot of Poké in LA and was excited to try this place based on the Yelp reviews. I would consider this the worst spot I've tried. It's set up like most others sort of. 
1. Select your fish(most you choose base first )
2. Select your sauce
3. Select your toppings
4. Select your base or in a burrito
I wanted tuna but I looked at it and it reminded me of the canned kind I ate as a kid on white bread. Not firm like ahi tuna should be. They don't really have many fish choices so I decided to go with salmon. I chose the burrito option which was a huge mistake. I could barely eat it as it was so dry. The rice was crunchy and the proportion of rice to filling was way off. Other Yelp reviews said the service was so great but that was not my experience. Makes we wonder if they are mostly friends and family writing them. The workers seemed completely disinterested and untrained. How hard is it to put fish and toppings and roll them up? I could not get out of this place any faster. With all the competitors in town, not sure how this place will make it, bad location, bad food and poor customer service."}
{"text":"Super awesome ! Being from Hawaii, we were just visiting and I was craving poke. Found this place on the map and had such a tasteful experience. Everyone was also very nice and welcoming. Giving 4 stars only because of the portion of poke you get. Very small scooper and I was shocked when that's all I was getting, being that the poke is the best part and what's advertised. If they added more scoops or substituted for a bigger scooper then it would definitely be PERFECT! But Thanks for great quality food."}
{"text":"Great food and definitely a healthy option. More poke restaurants in area popping up with this being a decent place. The prices are same or a bit higher than the other ones close by. ( especially the drinks) The biggest difference is the minimal choices of proteins. Salmon, shrimp, tuna, tuna or tuna ( 3 types)....still great !!!"}
{"text":"Upon entering the place smelled like piss or cleaner, not sure you can get those confused? The chilled table looked like it was defrosting and not properly chilling the fish and veggies. Everything looked old, like it had been sitting there all day, not very clean or fresh. Plain tuna tasted disgusting (and this is my third poke spot try this month I know what good tuna tastes like) I feel like I wasted $11. Cilantro had yellowed and gone bad. I feel like nobody there really cares about keeping the food fresh. Also the tuna looked odd, and smelled off. Like it was covered in an oil slick (look). Toppings are limited choices. Save your money and go elsewhere, came because of the good reviews and I feel misled.

Update: The owner does have good business practice. Upon reading my review they messaged me, apologized and offered a free bowl or wrap if I returned. Not sure I will go back, but I have a LOT of respect for any business that puts the customer first and tries to handle complaints respectfully and with hospitality, hence I will give them two stars instead of my original one star because I appreciate any business that makes an effort to right a wrong and puts the customer first."}
{"text":"Similar to other concepts like this around the Valley - but also better, because of the customer service, cleanliness of the restaurant, and very sweet and helpful staff. Every time it is delicious; they have a wide variety of authentic (I'm told, by my friends who know) choices. I always get the bowl, but the burrito-style wrap is really cute and looks tasty as well. This is definitely a once per week stop!"}
{"text":"The food is very good, fresh, and healthy.  I love the spicy crab and the sriracha aoli sauce.  The prices are reasonable for the portion, 10 dollars for what I would consider 2 servings.  The staff is very helpful, friendly, and patient. I eat here every weekend, I absolutely love it."}
{"text":"Ordered a poke bowl from this restaurant and it started up good enough. The service was friendly and the restaurant was clean. The seafood looked really fresh but after getting the food I realized that the poke was somewhat warm...normally poke bowls are cold poke with fresh warm rice but the entire bowl was lukewarm and it worries me. Luckily, I didn't get sick. Overall, I might give this place another shot but hopefully it was just an off day..."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place out due to my disappointment with other poke places in the valley. After looking through other Yelp reviews and photos I decided to give it a go. Unlike other poke shops, Pokitrition uses quality FRESH tuna and salmon. You won't find any ice crystals on this fish! I was amazed at the number of sauces available and the variety of toppings too. I opted for a poke wrap with half marinated tuna and half regular tuna. The poke was then mixed in a small bowl with some of their Korean sauce and put onto my seasoned rice/seaweed wrapper. Then came the jalapeño, 2 scoops of spicy krab salad, mango, crispy onions, chives, cucumber, and watermelon radish. At the register, they had samples of their sweet mango black tea. Loved it, so I grabbed a full size one. My order total came out to $13.94. To me, that's incredibly reasonable considering my poke wrap was HUGE and I got a large specialty tea. I honestly can't wait to come back, I am so impressed. I gotta tell all my friends, if you want good poke, this is where you have to go!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! It's almost like the chipotle of sushi! They have amazing customer service and the food is so fresh and delicious! Soon became one of my fave post workout places to go. Def worth the hype"}
{"text":"This is the equivalent of a subway but 1000 times better because... Sushi . I had the spice-sea wrap with everything on it. It was my first trip so didn't want to have to think too much about what to get. I really enjoyed this! I added a touch of soy sauce and it needed nothing else. I know it's a \"wrap\" but \"sushi burrito\" is much more fun to say. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients and tastes so good! Great looking place too. Will try to make it to their grand opening this coming Sunday!"}
{"text":"Great service! Friendly, helpful, and nice, makes it difficult to provide a bad review... unfortunately, this really wasn't what I was really looking for out of a poke place. Still looking for something like 'Da Poke Shack' in Hawaii... with that said, it was still really good. 4 stars and I recommend it if you want a 'Chipotle' style seafood place."}
{"text":"Average.   I kinda felt like the price to food ratio is way to high.  Consider making the pricing more competitive."}
{"text":"My sisters & came for the grand opening bogo. The line was long but definitely worth the wait. So many fresh choices to make a delicious bowl, salad, or wrap. Tuna or marinated tuna?  Salmon & Tako or just salmon. We had a variety today: marinated tuna with seaweed salad, siracha aoili topped with crispy onion; salmon & tuna with surimi crab, seaweed salad, siracha aoili topped with furikaki, cilantro, masago; spicy tuna & tako, spicy surimi, sesame shoyu, furikaki, crispy onion, masago, sesame; salmon & spicy tuna, crab surimi, siracha aoili, red cabbage, edamame, radish, crispy onion.  OMG all so good! I know I've seen tons of IG pix of sushi burritos so I was eager to try it. Next visit will be a new protein combo in a bowl. Maybe brown rice. Samples of mango or peach green teas were passed around while we waited in line. Those too were tasty. I'm excited for the next round!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch yesterday and was so satisfied with the food. The portions are big and delicious. If you like sushi you will love Pokitrition!!"}
{"text":"First time here and I'll definitely be back. 
Was a bit intimidated by the build your own, so went with the Salmon Bowl. Yum! 
Fresh salmon and veggies. Love the seaweed salad too!"}
{"text":"Came in for the soft opening. Got a free burritos with my selfie. 

Location is clean and modern. Staff was generous and more than knowledgeable. 

You can pick from a bowl or salad or a Burritos which is what they are known for. I'm not gonna post all the options (my pics will do). 

The poke burrito was delicious. Not nearly as messy as I thought. 

I'm a big fan. I'll try and be back whenever I'm on this side of town!! 


Grand Opening starts at noon on Sunday June 24th. They have BOGO until they run out."}
{"text":"Eh, it was okay. The serving sizes was on the stingier side than other Poke places I have been to. Flavor was more bland and I was hoping that they would have had marinated veggies. Granted, the salmon and rice tasted decent so I rated it average."}
{"text":"5 stars for food, 3 stars for service.
I went for the soft opening on Friday to get a poke bowl for myself and my fiance. The new location looks great!  The food was appetizing and fresh. I understand this is the soft opening and they're in the process of training new staff, but these are a few things I noticed.
1. Portion size was very inconsistent. I had three decent scoops of protein while my fiance ended up with about a scoop and a half even though he asked for three scoops. Also, the fish is cut pretty small so there isn't much fish even in a \"full\" scoop.
2. We were over charged and didn't realize it until we got home which was our mistake for not bringing it up. My bowl was charged for 4 scoops of protein instead of three.

In all, I'm looking forward to coming back again once things are running a little more smoothly as the bowl tasted great! Just a few kinks to work out!"}
{"text":"Friendly workers, good quality food. There isn't a wide selection of options but overall really good. I recommend trying it."}
{"text":"So I left my wallet at home today and I was starving cuz it was a late night at the office and on the way home realized I can order online using my Yelp account that's tied to my card how perfect and to top it off with some awesome poke"}
{"text":"LOVE! 
I didn't know I was a poke fan until I came here. Ordered the sushi wrap, and it's AH-MAZING. Seriously. Like heaven in your mouth amazing. Service was great too. It was our first time so they were super helpful and patient as we chose our items. 
They definitely did not skimp on the toppings, and I felt that everything was very fresh. 
I'm kind of scared to try other poke places, because this one set some high expectations. 
I 100% recommend this place, and hope they open more locations closer to where I live! I will get a sushi burrito every week! I promise!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! I've been here a few times and I'm always impressed! I you have always wanted, but have not had a \"Poke (sushi) Burrito\" you need to add this place to your bucket list!! No joke! I had a Poke Bowl ($9.95) includes 2 generous scoops of protein (aka fish or tofu) $1.95 will get you an extra scoop! I had a scoop of tuna and 2 salmon. You can add your 'sauce' they have several options for any pallet. You choose 2 sides, seaweed salad and/or crab salad and toppings, they have several! Think of Chipotle style ordering style. The restaurant is VERY clean and the raw fish is kept to the correct temperature! The staff is also very friendly and encourages questions from guests who are unfamiliar with 'Poke'. This is a fun restaurant to take friends and family, or when you are looking for something new & out of the ordinary!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place because I like Ahi Poki Bowl. After going to Hawaii I was craving places like this. I honestly like ahi poki better... For salads at least. The salad here is not mixed with any dressing. In ahi poki bowl they let you make your own dressing that they mix in the salad. The tuna and salmon meat are njce but the toppings here also don't make sense? Jalapeños? Red cabbage? ... All and all it still tastes good I just prefer the other place. More flavour, more seasoning and better toppings."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here. 
I looks ant tastes fresh. 
The line can be a little long at times but it's worth the wait. 
Not a place for big groups but cozy enough for a cheap lunch. 
Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. When I ordered my  wrap and salad bowl person who made my order was very very light with the protein tuna/salmon.  Three people behind me had orders made by different people serving them and what appeared to be at least somewhat decent amount of protein.  That being said once ur in line ur kinda stuck with what u get.  The fish wasn't as fresh as we thought.  The service  was good but for a salad and burro 22 dollars was to much for a lot of rice and a little bit fish"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem. This is real burrito place. Well if u expect to have mexican burrito, will be even more surprised. I knew it was sushi burrito place and i was shocked by owner's idea of making small sushi into burrito type. I am an asian and i am very familiar with this kind of food. This is just made just 2-3times bigger in terms of size. Now the real problem is how they can make it tasty. Well... they did a hack of a job. The ingredient, fresh fish, and sauce blended in perfectly. The salad or bowl looks very similar to Ahi-poki. Great place for lunch. I will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  I usually order the wrap, which I highly recommend.  I let the server give me suggestions for what to add to the wrap, as you can personalize your meal any way you want.  The miso soup is a must, if you like soup.  The drinks selection is great.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Prob the best poke spot we've had. Had our fair share of poke, including from several spots in Cali, NYC, and AZ. The staff are always super friendly, the food is always deloycious , the price isn't too bad, and usually (except for a couple of times) the portions are great. The only complaint is that there isn't one closer...doesn't seem fair to dock points for that though. Yassss pokitrition, Werk."}
{"text":"Its chipotle for sushi . 

If you really like Sushimi this place would be perfect but I'm not a real sushi eater and the burrito is just so much fish it kinda gets gross it was good but jus way too much fish"}
{"text":"I first had poke in Southern California and I instantly fell in love with it. After moving to Chandler, I have been on the look out for a good poke place. I'm glad I decided to take a chance and venture into Pokitrition. The one thing I look for when I go to a place that serves raw fish is odor. I was glad that Pokitrition did not have a fishy smell at all. The menu is simple and straight forward and the staff is amazing. I got a poke bowl with brown rice. For my protein I chose marinated ahi tuna and regular ahi tuna with sriracha aioli. I got seaweed salad, spicy crab, scallions, masago and sesame seeds as well. The fish was fresh, delicate and flavorful. Loved what I got and I'm curious to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Love this food! Staff is very helpful, and hooked me up with a gift card for my friend ... they have gift cards everybody!!"}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles where there are many Poke choices. We usually get 3 scoops, not just 2, of fish for $9.99.  My favorite poke place in LA gives 5 scoops! They only offer 4 fish options-salmon, tuna, spicy tuna and shrimp--limited. In LA, I usually get double salmon, octopus, tempera shrimp and scallops (and free avocado). Free Mango add in here is a nice touch. Still missing and prefer the miso dressing option. Great unusual drinks but pricey for tea. Friendly staff. I would probably give 3 stars but I want the poke shops to succeed in AZ."}
{"text":"Great concept but I won't ever be going back.  Serving size is horrible. I paid 50$ for lunch.  Food was good.  I don't ever see a need to come back when I can pay the same price and get twice as much with way more of a selection and better \"house\" sauces. AhiPoki crushes this place.  I tried it though. Was good.  They just don't understand their market yet."}
{"text":"I felt like I was cheating on my regular poké place by coming here, but my friend was meeting some friends here so I decided to get a bowl to-go. It was pretty busy when we got here around 7 and the atmosphere felt chaotic to me. The employees were great and took care of us despite the busy crowd. 

The setup was familiar except the menu was off to the side of the initial ordering location, so I moved a bit to the side to see what was different than other places. 2 scoops is $10 with additional toppings extra. I got my standard half half bowl with white rice and greens and spicy tuna and salmon. They also have sushiritos which was new to me. The toppings are similar and I got edamame, cucumber, spicy crab salad, regular crab salad, jalapeños, red and green onions, and crunchy toppings. I got a mix of their Sriracha aioli and sesame shoyu sauce. 

When I started eating it, I could taste the mayo from the aioli and it was strong to me, I didn't like it. I added soy sauce but I think that made things worse. There was something off about my combo bowl but I couldn't pinpoint exactly what else it was. Usually, poké blends together pretty well but it didn't here. It seems like I'm in the minority because of the high ratings here, and I'm glad for that because that means other people have had great experiences here. I will still venture and try out more poké places but I will be more humble about my expectations."}
{"text":"Pretty expensive, but really good food for what you pay. I got the burrito version and it was decent but lacking flavor. Next time I might get the bowl so I can control flavors better per bite."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly to start with. Getting to see them make your food to order was neat. But they don't mess around the fresh fish with the array of toppings makes for an outstanding finished product. 10/10 would recommend the wrap."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place quite a bit.  Unlike some other poke stops in town I've had, they weren't stingy with the fish here. Two scoops plus two scoops of crab salad and you have a hearty meal.  The flavors were all good and the choice of toppings exceeded my expectation.  For $10, it's a fair price.  The wraps looked good too...think a giant sushi roll.  I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I wish it was closer to where I live (just a thought maybe make one up north)

I've been here twice and guarantee I will be back. The bowls and wraps are good. I think I might be addicted to the wraps (a giant sushi roll basically). You can taste the quality of ingredients and the price point to quality is good. I hope their quality remains high because I feel this is really what separates them from their competition, also I don't know anywhere else that does the poki wraps. 

In a one week time they have adjusted so much to work out their soft opening kinks. Sky is the limit with how they will progress, I am excited for more of their stuff to roll out. (They have miso soup here, if that's something you want. It kind of hides in the menu)"}
{"text":"Talk about a high throughput establishment!  The line looked a little daunting when I first entered for a late lunch but the servers were very efficient (and friendly) so it was amazingly fast to get through. 

Definitely a great place for a quick, healthy meal with impressive variety for the amount of space available in the preparation area. 

The ingredients were fresh and had good mouth feel (the fish really is sushi grade). I have never had a poke with a base other than rice so I gave the salad base a try. It did not seem like my ingredient choices were the best fit for that option so the next time I will either ask the servers for their recommendations as to what compliments a poke salad or maybe try a wrap instead. 

The price was reasonable for the quality and quantity of food. The seats were full when I got in line but there were some available after paying (which was just as efficient as the preparation line). There is also outside seating on either side of the building and parking should not be an issue. 

Thanks to the owners for adding to the diversity of Chandler and to Yelp for telling me about it!"}
{"text":"I love ahi poke but I loved the idea of putting all that wonderfulness in a burrito or giant sushi roll. It was exactly what I hoped but I knew the seaweed wouldn't hold so I asked for an extra piece to double wrap it. I got the tuna and salmon but they minimal topping selection. They explained to each customer how the assembly line worked. They bragged about the watermelon juice and we got suckered in, it was good but not 5 dollars for a little bottle good."}
{"text":"First off, I am obsessed with the poke trend. It's become one of my favorite go-to meals the past year. Trying all the different restaurants that pop up has become a sort of foodie quest.

I have seen the sushi burrito pictures on my Instagram for quite sometime, however being a CenPho girl, I rarely venture to either side of the valley for fast casual type food. So, having an occasion to be on the East side, Pokitrition was immediately added to the itinerary. 

My friend and I arrived early, right before what appeared to be a lunch rush. The menu is easy to understand (pick your base, proteins, sauces, and add ins) and labeled for gluten free and a few other allergens. 

Obviously, I went for the burrito base, as that is what makes this place different and added spicy tuna, seaweed salad, onions, edamame, avocado, masago and a few other things. Immediately, I could see how this place did not skimp on portions! 

My burrito, pictured, was amazing and definitely enough food for two people who aren't starving. The process seemed like it takes more time, particularly of you order a burrito than other poke bowl places and they were out of kombucha, but those 'complaints' were minor.

I cannot wait until the 16th Street location opens!"}
{"text":"Very knowledgeable employees, my poke salad bowl was absolutely delicious! The fish and ingredients were all very fresh despite the late hour we went."}
{"text":"So delicious, tried it last night and I think I'll have again tonight!

I always get the spicy tuna and am never disappointed :)"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite poke restaurant in the Phoenix area! Not only do they have poke bowls, but sushi burritos/wraps as well!! I've tried both and they are different, but delicious! It's really up to preference. I suggest that you fill the wrap with more crunches for it to have more texture. I prefer my wrap with less of the other toppings, because I feel like it can bee too much when you take a bite. It is different from the bowl, since you can pick and choose what you'll have in one bite. Both of choices are super filling so no need to compare which option might have more food. 
My favorite protein is their marinated tuna and salmon. Even though the marinated tuna is mixed in with sesame shoyu sauce, I still add on the yuzu ponzu sauce to it. The mix is still very good! The one last thing I would recommend is their cold brew tea! Both green and black tea are to die for! Their tea has a strong tea flavor, and I personally love to drink tea, which is probably why I like it. 
Don't let the lunch or dinner rush scare you away. Although the line might seem long (to the door), they get to you pretty quick. And that's not the fascinating part. The best part is that the staff is still nice and super friendly during the rush! The staff here is so FRIENDLY, which makes the experience here so much better."}
{"text":"This place is really good and it is close to home so I'll be visiting at least once a week!! The fish and other ingredients are very flavorful and fresh and you can customize your own bowl to make it super awesome!   Deserves five stars for the very yummy food and very friendly staff.   I do have to mention it takes a while to get through the line even when they aren't busy, but definitely worth the wait.   Knocking off a star for the wait. It takes a really long time to get through the line."}
{"text":"I love that there are new Poke places opening around town! It was our first time at Pokitrition tonight. I like how they offer a rice bowl, salad and a wrap, usually Poke places only have rice bowl or a salad. 
While I liked the flavor of their marinated tuna, the portion is lacking. We ordered a total of 3 bowls, 2 regular bowls and a kid's bowl. Unfortunately, they were all the same size. Kids size. Luckily my 6 year old enjoyed his Poke Bowl and says it tasted fresh. We will probably be back again, hopefully by then portions won't be kid sized!"}
{"text":"Came for Pokitrition's grand opening and braved the 2-hour wait to try their rendition of the famous poke bowl. I had eaten poke before in small bites but never as a full meal. As I will be visiting Kauai soon, I wanted to get a full serving of this thing everyone goes crazy about. I was absolutely blown away with the quality and taste at this new business!

I ordered a poke bowl with marinated tuna, cabbage, seaweed salad, and sesame seeds drenched in sriracha aioli. In a word: heavenly! My wife ordered the same but with spicy tuna and I got to have a bite--equally as good as the marinated mix. For a beverage we bought a bottle of watermelon water, which is exactly as awesome as it sounds (water taken straight from ripe watermelons--none added!). My wife loved the experience so much that she bought an \"I (heart) poke\" tank from them for $10. Someone's a little excited for Hawaii next month hehe.

The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming during the duration of our wait and meal. It really put the cherry on top and made it a certainty that I'll be back for many more poke bowls (and wraps) to come!"}
{"text":"Fantastic bowls. The reviews are accurate this place is great the ingredients are fresh."}
{"text":"Delicious poke burrito! Everything tastes fresh and the staff was very nice! So nummie"}
{"text":"Great place to have a healthy meal.  The ingredients are fresh and delicious.  The prices are a tad higher than other poke restaurants but definitely great tasting meal.

The staff here are friendly and inviting and do a great job of assisting diners to navigate their process.  And the dining area was immaculent."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean, the employees were very friendly and helpful and the food seemed very fresh and of good quality. They also offer stamp cards to get a free bowl or wrap after purchasing 10!"}
{"text":"Umm, what is there to say. They are wonderful at prepping poke. They have all of the tastes and many of the fishes. I ate a wrap that was great to ate. I'm not even making it up. I'll eat there again if I can help it. And sauces."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I were looking for something quick, simple, healthy, and tasty for dinner that was close to home
I recommended this restaurant after having read several good reviews.

We shared a Sushi Burrito (Marinated Tuna, Cooked Shrimp, Sriracha Aioli, Seaweed Salad, Surimi Crab, Mango, Avocado, and Crispy Wonton Strips) and a Yuzu Salmon Bowl.

Pros:
Their menu offered several familiar options for the fish, seasonings, and sides to satisfy most any fan of Poke.
The quality of the fish and the other ingredients was good and everything tasted fresh.
All of the ingredients worked very well with each other and the flavor of the fish came through quite nicely.
The portions in the burrito were generous and were as much as could possibly fit in a rolled up sheet of nori.
Service was prompt and very courteous despite the restaurant being somewhat busy on a Friday evening.

Cons:
The only downside is that this type of food can be a little pricey; the tab for the two of us came to a little over $30.
This is to be expected for Poke, though, and is not a true negative provided you're aware of this in advance."}
{"text":"This is my first trip so went with the Spice Sea Wrap.  It was huge and a little challenging to eat sue to size but absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"This place is so good!! The people there were so welcoming, patient and nice!! My best friend and I both got a Poke Bowl and a Poke Wrap and we loved it. My favorite will be the Poke Wrap, it's very filling and flavorful for sure. Also the Mango Green Tea was AMAZING!!! I will def be going back."}
{"text":"Came here while on vacation to Arizona to visit some family and was craving some poke, stumbled across this place from yelp and wanted to stop by to try it out. 

First impression of the place is that it is very clean and I love how simple their concept is. The shop is very welcoming and I was greeted right away. In California we have a bunch of Poke places and I've tried a lot of them so I know what good poke is supposed to be like. 

So first thing is that it is basically a very similar concept as Chipotle where you pick what you want in your bowl/salad.wrap. They have so much selection here and it works like an assembly line. The employees were very friendly and made sure that they made it just the way that I like it. I went with the rice bowl and chose salmon and tuna with sriracha aioli (BOMB.COM) and a bunch of other sides. My boyfriend got the poke wrap and was so excited to eat it. Let me tell you....seriously for a place out in Arizona I was shocked as to how bomb it was. The fish was fresh and all the flavors were ON POINT. I personally love the aioli because it is a bit creamy, but the sesame shoyu my boyfriend got was pretty good too. Overall our meal was very nice and fresh and delicious. 

I see why there would be so many good reviews, this place definitely lives up to all the good yelp reviews. For the price for the bowl and wrap (I underestimated it, I WAS SO FULL but kept eating) came out to be around $20 something and it was so worth it. SO GLAD I FOUND THIS PLACE!!! Will definitely be coming back again when I come visit from California again !"}
{"text":"Amazing. The best Poke in town. Fresh,clean and super friendly services. highly recommended. Definitely be back."}
{"text":"The sushi burrito is amazing! It may sound gross to some but it is extremely fresh and filling. The employees are always super nice and energetic and are willing to listen to what you need from them."}
{"text":"Can't give this place enough stars! My mom and I had a lunch date here when they first opened. It was her first time trying poke, my millionth time, and we both absolutely loved it! They were jam packed since they're a new place, but they handled the crowd quickly and professionally. All of their food options are up on a menu so it's easy to read and quick to decide. Prices are also clearly listed out so you're never surprised at what you end up paying for your bowl. They're also very fairly priced.

My mom comes in all the time now. I went with her today for the second time and was pleased that the staff recognized her, asked how she was, and thanked her for continuing to come in. You're really only as good as your staff, and man does this place hit it out of the park.

This is also the first poke shop that I've seen the option to get a bowl or a wrap, which is essentially a poke burrito. Tried the wrap for the first time today and it was fantastic! I'm never let down by the food here. Excellent quality, excellent taste.

I only hope that they expand their food options in the future. They have a great selection as is right now but it would be nice to see more options added as you continue to grow.

My new favorite poke place! Absolutely must try!"}
{"text":"Build your own Poki? Yes, please! Fresh fish, veggies and rice. If you don't know what you want they have bowl combo suggestions. Reasonable pricing for large portions.

We ordered on the online website which forced us to choose surimi. No thank you. 

They have a sauce bar where you can load up on all your favorite sauces. 

The inside is a little small but you can see staff making your food."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place shortly after we moved to Chandler. We absolutely love it! The fish is SO fresh, and we always end up full, but not overly stuffed or weighed down.

Totally an appropriate amount of food that is worth the price. We make this our weekly \"out to eat\" place. 

On top of that, the staff is always friendly and helpful. 

Overall definitely worth taking a chance on!!"}
{"text":"This place is just absolutely delicious.  Ever since the first time I tried it, I've been absolutely hooked on it and have not had a single bad experience and the food was never disappointing despite my high expectations for it.

I will put it out there that I have not had any other Poke before trying out Pokitrition, but this place is just so amazing that it's hard for me to want to try others.  I legitimately do not understand how this place keeps fish so fresh in Arizona... I've occasionally had some good fresh fish while getting sushi at places like Osaka Japanese Grill, but even on its best day, it didn't compare to how the fish is here every day.

Legit good, will keep coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was because we were in a rush or we ate a late breakfast but when we had lunch there, things didn't taste appetizing.  I had the spicy tuna with crab and seaweed salad.  I want to go back to see if things change cause I love poke."}
{"text":"Wwwwwoooowwwww!! This was my first time here and it was soooo good! Where has this sushi burrito been all my life? 
As a first timer the staff was very patient explaining items and helpful in forming my \"burrito\" masterpiece. The fish, shrimp, veggies, and sauce were very fresh. My sushi burrito was so huge, ughhh I'm so full. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've tried a few poke shops around town, and this was pretty average. The fish was not amazing nor were the flavors. The service was great, and the staff was friendly. There were no complimenting drinks or desserts which was a little of a bummer. These guys are new though, so I'll give them another try."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place scrolling through Yelp while looking for lunch. I haven't had poke in a while and decided to give this new spot a try! I was so pleasantly surprised!!!! I ordered the poke wrap(looks like a poke burrito basically) filled with tuna, salmon and a bunch of other goodies! I was a little concerned with how I'd like poke in wrap form, but it was amazing!!!! I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"I was welcomed as soon as I set foot in the door. Super awesome place. They also like to make conversation to make it a more friendly environment. The Sushi burritos are amazing!!! Must try!"}
{"text":"I keep on reading the name of this place as Poke Stop lol. Don't worry you won't find any Magikarp on this menu! This place differs from other poke places in that they offer sushi burritos/sushi wraps. Protein selections are a little less diverse than at other places but the fish is fresh. 

I had a sushi wrap with marinated tuna, salmon, and a plethora of toppings including diced mango, watermelon radish and masago. The marinated tuna is marinated in their ponzu sauce, and the yuzu dressing that they use is more on the tart side than super sweet which I liked. Also note that they will not make your wrap with brown rice. I think it's probably because the brown rice won't stick to the seaweed wrap like white rice does.

I loved the sushi wrap. It was hearty, filling, and I loved the mix of flavors and textures. The rice was soft and fluffy and it was a good amount of food for lunch. While the fish was fresh it did have a bit of a sticky texture to me. 

They don't have a soda fountain but they do have a varied selection of drinks including cold pressed watermelon juice, Hawaiian soda made with coffee extract, Press cold brew coffee and freshly brewed iced tea.

Service was superb. The young woman and gentleman working here were awesome. 

Overall it's a good place to get your poke fix! 4.5/5."}
{"text":"Cannot get enough poke right now, anytime my husband and I get take-out it's always poke. I could eat here everyday. So yummy! Wasabi"}
{"text":"10/10 highly recommend if you are a sushi fanatic! I typically go to other spots for poki bowls but man.... poki burritos are a game changer! I spoke to a very nice young lady who stated that their fresh fish ships overnight from Hawaii. If you are a creative foodie and love hot cheetos, this place is also for you! They give you the option of adding hot cheetos. My first order was perfect or maybe I just got lucky? I got the sushi burrito with hot cheetos, salmon & ahi tuna (tossed in sriracha aoli), red onions, seaweed salad, spicy crab, masago, avocado, and crunchy onions. Yummy in my tummy!"}
{"text":"This place stays busy at lunchtime during the week, but I'm so glad I dropped in! 2 protein bowls are $9.95, add $1.95 for each extra scoop. Shrimp, ahi Tuna, spicy tuna, salmon, marinated ahi tuna and tofu are protein options. Also may pick between white rice, brown rice, salad mix or go for a sushi burrito! I went with my bowl preparers favorite and tried the Yuzu Ponzu sauce and found it very light and not very detectable, which I prefer. Sides: seaweed salad and either Reg crab or spicy crab, and your typical list of toppings and crunchy options you see at poke focused restaurants! Avocado is $1 upcharge. Drinks are a little pricey, but they do offer complimentary cucumber water, which is my favorite! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"great food, great selections to make your own. great people too. it was our first time and they were good introducing the ingredients."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but I definitely felt the urge to write one for this place!

I was greeted by everyone who was working and they all seemed happy to be there and not just there for the paycheck. 

This is just a small local business that just recently opened four months ago and the design and the feel of the place was super comfy and cute, albeit it is a bit small.. but most people seemed to take their food to go. 

There was definitely a wait as i walked in and thought i would have to wait a while to get to me, but everyone seemed to be so joyful and efficient. 

The fish was YUM! The recommendations they provided were PERFECT!

Will come again before leaving PHX!"}
{"text":"Great service! It was my first time there and the guy behind the counter answered all of my questions. I got a poke wrap and it was delicious! Fresh and flavorful ingredients. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Finally tried Pokitrition tonight for dinner and I'm definitely impressed. The line was lengthy, but I can't complain because it's really worth the wait. I did a bowl with marinated tuna + spicy tuna (I love Tuna hahaha) with half rice/half salad. My boyfriend had the wrap and he was obsessed! Seriously fresh fish, literally blown away by the quality. The staff was very friendly and helpful when I asked for suggestions on their sauces. I also love the large variety in toppings! (*Mangos topped on poke is, without a doubt, a game changer*) They aren't cheap on portions, so you don't have to worry about not getting your money's worth because you will. The cashier who is also the co-owner was super friendly and accommodating. She really took the time to talk to me and asked about my first-time experience. It's safe to say that they've won me over and I can't wait to come back! 

Never paying for overpriced + mediocre poke bowls and bad service from Ahi Poke Bowl again!"}
{"text":"I have been HUNTING for a place that has a sushi burrito in Arizona ever since I tried one in California and I came across this on accident and I am overcome with joy! 

I work right by Chandler fashion square mall and this is a 5 minute drive from work ! Right off the 101 and Ray road. Needless to say, this will be my only go to spot for lunch now. Found it on yelp today and within 5 minutes , my co worker and I rushed over to get one. 

Just like all the poke bowl places here but you have your choice of a bowl, wrap, or salad and great choices of mix ins.  We each got a wrap. I got mine with tuna and salmon and you get your choice of 2 additional add ins such as seaweed salad or crab salad or spicy crab salad. I got 2 scoops of crab salad to go with my tuna and salmom, and I got avocado, which is a dollar extra but they do not hold back on the amount they give you. Put a few finishing touches on it with masago and green onions and sesame seeds. It was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I was in heaven eating this the whole time and my co worker loved it and already told his friend about it. 

Place is small but has adequate seating. Everyone who worked here was so nice and smiled!  Make sure you get one of their stamp cards if you plan on going back as much as I do.  Can't wait to come back and turn on more of my co workers to it !"}
{"text":"Great poke bowls with lots of topping options!! Highly recommend!  Just wish they had some tables outside where you could sit to eat"}
{"text":"Basically poke in a rice bowl  a seaweed wrap or on a salad.  Assembly line style similar to subway but slot more tasty.   Friendly and efficient staff.  Sometimes longer lunch lines but they staff to accommodate it.  Try it."}
{"text":"First time here and I LOVE it. The atmosphere is fresh and new, very trendy. The employees are seriously the most patient and fun workers I've been around in awhile. The food is amazing!!! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Two of the best things in the world burritos and  sushi mixed together that change your world for the better! They have really amazing looking salads but I haven't had the joy of trying them yet I can't wait to go back and eat there again."}
{"text":"Pokitrition is much better then a lot of the poki places I've tried! They have really fresh fish and the guy at the front was really helpful and friendly. I recommend trying the sushi burrito dipped in flaming hot Cheetos ! Weird but strangely delicious."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Pokitrition already, but I had heard their new ginger miso sauce was out and I had to give it a try. It was very delicious and I had it with salmon in a wrap. It adds a sweeter taste and smells like fresh ginger. The team working there were amazing per usual with their service and overall friendliness, especially Justin! Thank you Justin for the amazing wrap and tea!"}
{"text":"My first time going to Pokitrition and it was so good. I usually go to AhiPoki but came here to try the sushi wrap and it was amazing. I could only eat half, you get so much food. They have a nice variety of fish that you can have two scoops of and in addition to two scoops of any combo of krab, spicy krab, or seaweed salad plus other dry toppings. This was a really fun experience and the employees were very friendly. Also the water has cucumbers in it - a nice touch!!"}
{"text":"Pokitrition was my very first poke bowl experience and WOW! This place is fantastic. The employees are super friendly and extremely helpful. The Bowl is the way to go."}
{"text":"I love a place that greets you with this kind of enthusiasm.. they make you comfortable when you walk in.. they walk you through your options so you never feel like you don't know what you're doing .. 

I had the Marinated and spicy tuna over half brown rice/ half salad greens .. crab & seaweed salads (extra) .. avocado (extra) ... how pretty is the mango and watermelon radish.. with the sesame dressing. Delicious and filling.. every bite is different.

They sell watermelon water, cold brew and boxed water (funny).. we had the peach green tea .. 

Fresh and yummy.. they get busy at dinner time .. dining room has limited seating .. we'll be back .. don't forget to get a punch card for free food"}
{"text":"I've tried several Poke restaurants in the valley and i have to honestly say this one is hands down the best! Portions are much larger than other places, they have toppings that no one else has. Like watermelon radish and mango. And their cold brew ice teas are amazing! Almost forgot, service is excellent and friendly.

It's a little small and could be hard to find a seat during busy hours but not a big deal, just an fyi.

Try this place you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Delicious!

You can tell the ingredients are fresh just by looking at it. 

I had the Spice Sea burrito and it was delicious and huge. 

Super happy this place is right across the street from my company!"}
{"text":"Pretty good poke! Very clean and simple design! They also have poke burritos! There's nothing that extravagant about the poke but there's also nothing terrible about this place. The rice is cooked pretty well, however if you eat the poke burrito, it's a lot less flavorful because if you were to add sauce to it, it'll kinda lose its shape! 

The poke bowl is more worth it in my opinion, but I'm the kind of guy that likes to mix everything up after awhile of eating my bowl. The sauces are very normal and you definitely tried something similar to it at other poke places. 

The portions I will say are quite small. So I wasn't a fan of that. Also, this is not really a problem but it always seems like there's a million employees working there at a time, when there's only like 5 customers in the poke joint.

The reason I'm rating it 4 stars is because it's good, but is it really different from any poke joint like ahipoki? Not really."}
{"text":"I have been trying many poke places in the Chandler/Tempe area over the past few months. Pokitrition is not my choice for a bowl, but I am in love with the wraps/burritos and come regularly. Burritos are not common at poke shops and they are really the reason I drop by.

Also a plus, better drink choices than most poke shops with fresh brewed iced teas, both sweetened and unsweetened."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and the employees are super friendly. I especially love the fact that they have watermelon radishes because it makes the food look extra Instagram-worthy. Pokitriton is by far my favorite place to go for lunch!"}
{"text":"Visited the first time after a friend had let me try a bit of her salmon roll. I went on my lunch break early on a week day and was help quite a bit with my first time order. The only disappointment was that they were already out of wasabi and it wasn't even noon. Loved the flavors and over all health benefit of the food. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Phoenix! 

Eating the sushi burrito here is like a revelation especially after getting a heaping side of chojang to put on between bites. Need to ask for more of that sauce in the future as that mix of sesame oil, rice vinegar and gochujang is just deadly when combo'd with poki.

Go to order (Spi-Sea variant)

Marinated Tuna
Chojang
Onion
Jalapeno
Seaweed
Spicy Surimi
Mango
Green Onion
Wonton Strips

I don't even get sushi anymore as this place does the trick in a fast-casual format. For $10 plus tax I don't think you can match the taste or price. Only thing I wish for is that they have a location closer to Camelback so I don't have to trek as far for my fix. 

Drinks are awesome (Cold brew mango black tea is a must try) and staff are great. They deliver now too! 

Def check them out."}
{"text":"Best poke place in AZ I've tried so far. Better than pokedon, my previous favorite. The fish actually has color unlike ahipoki bowl."}
{"text":"OMG! Pokitrition, I think I am in love. This burrito wrap thingy is giving me life. 

The ingredients fresh, the taste delicious, and the service phenomenal.

You will see me again and again and again.

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend. Love how they greet everyone who walks into the door. It was our first time here so the guy behind the counter explained everything to us in perfect detail. Everyone was friendly except the one who was on the register. He needed a little more ummph and a little less \"I just want to go home.\" The only \"issue\" I have is the selection and prices/selection of drinks. Otherwise it was fresh, filling, and delicious. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Tried this place out today and was not disappointed. So glad to have a poke place close to home! Being from the Bay Area of CA where there are a ton of these places...this place is up there! Fresh ingredients...friendly staff...I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I got here a little before noon, no one was in line ahead of me but it looked like they had quite a few Togo orders. They worked on the Togo orders before helping me, which it seems like they should have one person working on the Togo orders instead of three people working on them. My friend had her daughter with us and she needed to use the restroom, since no one was helping us she took her daughter to the restroom. The cashier had to come and help me after I was waiting for few minutes. When my friend came back with her daughter, she tried to order her food and the cashier told her that she would now need to wait at the end of the line that grew to five more people. I was taken aback by that seeing we were Both waiting for quite some time before being helped. The food was great, very fresh and great flavors. The tea was flat, could tell it was not fresh. The staff was very friendly but they need to figure out better system to manage people in store and the Togo orders."}
{"text":"This is my favorite poke place. I didn't realize how many there were in the east valley but once I found out I went a little crazy hitting them all up. 
You can get a bowl or wrap, and a wrap is basically a one big sushi roll. It's amazing! All the toppings are wrapped in rice and seaweed is on the outside. I recommending going light on the sauce otherwise it can get soggy quick. There's so much flavor in all the toppings anyway that I prefer it NOT drenched in sauce. 
If you aren't a seaweed person get the bowl - in which case you you can also do salad instead of rice, or if you want both you can do half/half.
They also offer spicy crab meat here where most other places just have regular. It's sooo good!
They have a loyalty punch card so after 9-10 you can get a free bowl or wrap."}
{"text":"It's like Chipotle but sushi! Very good, large, large portions. We ordered take out and the staff was very helpful and patient w us newbies. 

I had the wrap, with salmon & tuna, saracha sauce, avocado, seaweed, green onions, cilantro and crunchy toppings. 

Kids had the bowls and could have easily split 1 bowl between the 2 of them. 

A great way to curb those sushi craving at an affordable price."}
{"text":"The sushi burrito/wrap was really good and even better that you get to basically customize it. I was actually surprised with bow good thr miso soup was. Definitely recommend this place to others and will be going again."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite poke shop in town! Everything is so fresh and the portions are great. My favorite is the wrap with marinated tuna and spicy tuna. The staff was very helpful my first couple of times there. Be prepared to wait in a line out the door if you go during the lunch hours, but definitely worth the wait, the line goes by pretty fast."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a traditional poke bowl, this location may not be what you're looking for. But if you're wanting a poke wrap (think a HUGE custom sushi roll), then this is the place to go! The flavors were amazing. The customer service was outstanding. The portions were huge. Even have a frequent purchase punch card. I was very satisfied customer. Will definitely be going back !"}
{"text":"I went there today for the first time, I have heard so many greats things from friends. 
Staff is super friendly, it was slow when I got there so I told them it was my first time and they actually took great care of me. 
Took out and enjoyed it at home. 
Salad bowl was awesome, fish fresh and tasty, toppings as delicious as every thing else. 
Highly recommended!
I will go back and become a regular for sure.
So happy to have a poke place close to work & home!"}
{"text":"Looks good, taste good, lots of choices nice staff.got the poke Salad,next time I will get the spices spice sea buritto."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of ahipoke bowl. This is the second time I've tried this place, its improved since the soft opening. I was major disappointed they were out of octopus and the line of 8 people took 20 mins to get through. The place is small and not conducive of large crowds. This summer the line is going to be out the door and not nice. I had the cold brew green tea, it was good if you love you'd tea sweet, I would have loved it unsweetened. May have been an option but I did not see that."}
{"text":"I love poke, and this place is great. Good options and I like that they have spicy crab and regular crab. The price is on par with other poke places and it's a quick and easy bite when you are running around"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time yesterday. And was absolutely impressed with everything. Had a poké bowl with ahi tuna and all the fixin's. These guys are doing it right! 

 By the way James J's review was Ludacris. I don't know what in the heck he was looking at that looks like canned tuna. Of course he's from L.A. and everything is better there. The fact that he has one review and no friends probably says it all though."}
{"text":"The sushiritto was very good! I got salmon and tuna with ponzu sauce. For the toppings I got mango (suppppppppper good!), watermelon radish, crab meat and a bunch of other toppings. I enjoyed the sushiritto alot! I ate it all on the spot and the Mexican coke was a refreshing compliment to the sushiritto. Only complaint was that they ran out of octopus and marinated tuna, but that's probably because the place was so packed they ran out of it. I will DEFINITELY be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced delicious and good service I ordered tuna avocado rolls and they were delicious fresh tuna and avocado and skillfully rolled"}
{"text":"I had the poke wrap or is it a burrito anywho it was good but not really my thang, different and worth trying of course, will be back to try a non wrap bowl once I hit like 5 more poke spots that have opened up"}
{"text":"Love this place! Fish was really fresh! Friendly staff! There is also wifi where I can study too! Will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Omg I absolutely love this place. I've tried the Poke bowl and the sushi burrito both are very yummy. All the employees are always very happy and friendly. The fish and vegetables are always fresh. My personal favorite is Dean marinated ahi tuna and spicy crab."}
{"text":"The best lunch I've ever had!  So good I went back a second time in one day.  I love that they have brown rice and everything is so fresh, healthy, and tasty.  The shop is adorable and the customer service is top notich."}
{"text":"Poke Poke everywhere!  Arizona has so many poke places now I can barely keep track. 
This poke shop is special because they let  you get order the colorful poke bowls in Sushi burrito style like infamous Sushiritto in SF. Since, SF is 12 hrs away pokitrition will do.

They have two unique machines that help spread rice on the seaweed. They are offering a special right now they have Hot cheetos to sprinkle on your wrap for a fiery instagram-friendly poke sushi burrito! 

When you move in line you can select different toppings like seaweed, furikake. I liked the sesame and ginger sauce for my protein. Avocado is $1 extra. My choice of protein was Salmon and Tuna which were very fresh. The fish is shipped from Hawaii and the quality is very good. 

I think they need hand menus because your caught off guard when it's your turn to order. There's not that much time to decide. Overall, I would come back. The sushi burritoes seem to have more food than the bowl. They were a little slow today and they forgot to give me wasabi for my order but this is a nice place for a quick lunch. Bonus they have fivestars to collect points 

Overall: 4"}
{"text":"The two times i've had the best Poke was on Oahu and in California but now i've found a goldmine!!! The food is wonderful! Fresh, raw and a great selection of drinks. It's new so it's busy but worth it! Keep it up."}
{"text":"It saddens me to have to write a one star review based on my experience today! I have been here the past two times during lunch and my experience has been 5 stars. However I came around 6:30 and the poke station was a mess!!! I could not believe my eyes. They were rolling the burritos on the counter filled with toppings that had spilled ! There was literally toppings everywhere that could have easily been wiped up. There was shrimp next to the seaweed salad, mango spilled everywhere in between the topping bins. I hope management sees this so they can be more cautious of the mess! Especially the start of dinner they should have a clean station."}
{"text":"Pokitrition was first founded by four friends who went to ASU. One of the friends, Jimmy, studied as sushi chef and this influenced his decision to help start the company. The four just wanted to bring cool, fresh, local food to the Valley. They fly in fish fresh from Hawaii on the daily and have become infamous for their....sushi burritos!

Coolest part about the sushi burrito? You get to customize it.  I ordered the marinated tuna, siracha aioli, ponzo sauce, seaweed, and spicy crab. I call this one the MerBear. Oh, and did I just name every single favorite thing about Japanese food? Yes! This made me especially happy because oh my gosh, this burrito was so big and delicious. I probably ate it too fast and furiously, but no regrets! How could I not fall in love at first bite? If you guys are in Chandler, Tempe, or just in Arizona, definitely check Pokitrition out."}
{"text":"Tucked in a corner of a strip mall, this great place opened in March. Healthy selection of tuna, choice of bowl, wrap or salad. Freindly staff and an eco conscious choice of locally sourced boxed water.   Delicious!"}
{"text":"I wanted to see what all the hype was about Poke Sushi Burritos. I ordered the salmon with ahi tuna burrito lots almost all the toppings. 

In my opinion, the burrito didn't have enough flavor and it was a bit heavy on my stomach.

I usually get poke salads with lots of dressing on it. Maybe it was just something I wasn't use to. I finished about half of the burrito and couldn't finish the rest. It was sitting right in my stomach."}
{"text":"Really like this place!! Is the name horrible? Yup!!

The salad was good and the wrap was bomb!

The only thing that could make it better is if they had some sliced jalapeño that you could add to your wrap for folks that like it extra spicy!

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is fresh, clean, and so flavorful! On top of that, the service is always amazing. The people that work here are enthusiastic and helpful, and they do it sincerely. I will be returning many more times, and recommending to anyone I know."}
{"text":"POKE + BURRITO = POKIRITO

I finally got the chance to try the hype, and they definitely impressed me. You can choose between the poke bowl with rice or salad, or poke wrap. You get two scoops of protein (more for extra $), sides, and toppings. I had my wrap filled with marinated tuna and salmon, crab meat, seaweed salad, cucumbers, and furikaki. The portions don't look huge, but it is FILLING for sure! I almost couldn't finish because I was getting so full, but I had to because it was so delicious! You probably get more food in the bowls because they don't have to worry about rolling it shut :)

For a first timer, the staff was so friendly and helpful. They explained everything so clearly but kept the line moving quickly! 

Environment: 4/5

{"text":"Always friendly service.  I love the poke wrap/burrito!  Lunch time on Fridays especially is busy,  so order online.  I just wish they had flavored brewed green teas.  Food always tastes fresh!"}
{"text":"Ok, went here to try the Sushi Burrito, but being NEW, i didn't order correctly,, my bad,, i thought the option to wrap it up at end would happen... 

Anyways, got the regular bowl, with salad, Tuna, and Salmon, Onions, Yuzu sauce, 2 scoops plain krab, cilantro, mango and masago, and a lil furikake, or whatever... 

Fish tasted very fresh,, kudos,, greens were crisp, and the toppings were really good... mango added a perfect sweetness to the bowl.. 

This is about same price as AP, but less protein options, that ok, since i can get MANGO on it ,, and 2 scoops krab stuff without the added dollar fee... Also Pokitrition seemed like the portion size was bigger... 

It comes down to,,, Closer to home, Mango toppings, and unless I want albacore or yellow tail (add $1), this is my goto spot now for some poki !!"}
{"text":"I never thought I would be interested in \"Sushirritos\", so I will admit I was a bit apprehensive when I came here with some family. Rarely can I say that coming to a place always brings a pleasant experience,but Pokitrition never lets me down. When we come here (now we are repeat customers) they always remember us and treat us with the utmost care, always suggesting new things to us and making sure we have everything we need. My only problem with the place is that they run out of shrimp so quickly! The first couple of times we went, they didn't have any and it was only recently that they had enough to give me for my sushirrito. Besides this, it is a great spot, a little pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Super tasty! I did the bowl half and half with salad and brown rice, spicy tuna and salmon...sesame ponzu for a more sweeter sauce...

I love the seaweed and crab salad and all of the mix ins...wonton crisps, avocado, cucumber, red onion...will have to try the wrap next time!! 

We heard seating is tough so we tried to go \"off peak\" lunch times...pretty long long after 1PM. 

Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"This is my first experience with a poke restaurant, and I found it delicious!  The people behind the counter were friendly, helpful, and patient with my inexperience ordering a poke bowl.  The food was great!  I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick dinner bite. If you like poke then this place will hit the spot. It's simple and easy and at a good price."}
{"text":"I've tried both the burrito and the bowl multiple times here. The burrito is a little too oily for my liking. The outside of the wrap always seems to have an oil like substance on it and does not make the burrito experience very satisfying. I would give the burrito 3 stars and their bowl 5 stars. Their bowls are excellent. All of the ingredients work well with each other to create a great meal. I hope one day they will figure out a way to make brown rice burritos."}
{"text":"Finally! My dream came true! A sushi burrito concept!!! Once we walked it we were greated by super friendly staff. They explained all the ingredients and the process. I had the salmon and marinated tuna and majority of the toppings. With a miso soup and mango tea. I was very surprised and hate to say it, but my burrito was bland.  probably will ask for extra spicy mayo next time. But everything tasted fresh. The burrito was huge chipotle sized. Miso soup was really good. Not salty at all. The tea was a bit strong for my taste buds. But I'm not a big black tea drinker. 
Overall the experience was great. I don't think it's fair to rate them low just because my taste buds weren't excited."}
{"text":"This is the best poke place around,  I've tried most of them. I probably eat here twice a week and its aleays busy. The value is great and the food is awesome. I only have 2 suggestions,  bigger bowls for the half & half, its hard to stir in the little bowl. Also,  drink selection,  I don't care for the tea and there isn't a soda fountain"}
{"text":"Very fresh!  Great customer service.  Next time I would get a bowl.  The burrito/sushi wrap was way too much food for me!  Loved all the options.  Excellent!  Will definitely go back!  I had the salmon!  Perfect!"}
{"text":"I attended the super fun, high energy Grand Opening, complete with a swamp cooler and a DJ (DJ Hai) to keep spirits up as we waited in the sweltering Phoenix heat. The 1st 50 people got free swag and they graciously offered samples of their teas to keep patrons hydrated which was a nice touch. As I made my way inside I was greeted with bright smiles and the interior was clean, trendy, and spacious. I loved the interior, especially the wall of real potted plants! We got in on the BOGO deal and let me tell you, we were so stoked! Everything was fresh, super delicious, and healthy. When I want to eat clean I am coming back! My hubby got the Rocking Shrimp burrito, I got a custom made to order poki salad bowl with salmon and marinated ahu tuna. Both were delicious and we were so pleased with our meals. Congrats on the new location!"}
{"text":"In keeping with our recent poke bowl addiction My roommate and I tried Poketrition this week. I was immediately struck with how friendly the staff was! 

The prices were more expensive than other poke places I've been, but they had some delicious sauces and toppings. I got an ahi tuna bowl with delicious seaweed salad and crispy onions. My roommate got an awesome-looking seaweed-wrapped burrito. 

Next time I plan to try the California style, which is just crab instead of fish and two bucks cheaper. The point is, there will be a next time."}
{"text":"I have eaten in restaurant once and this time we had it delivered.  Let me statt by saying their online ordering is nothing short of amazing.  Very easy to get exactly what you want.  I love intuitive design.  We all had poke bowls and we all got what we wanted.   Very fresh, very filling.  I just wish this place was in Chattanooga.  Delivery was also quick."}
{"text":"Our first time to a Poke establishment in AZ and I have to say I was satisfied. We went at a busy time (Monday lunch hour) so seating was very limited. The protein selection was good and seemed fresh. The sauces were the right amount and the rest of the toppings made for a lot of choices.  I love that they give you two scoops of either crab or seaweed salad. It makes the cost of an 11$ bowl worth it.  Overall this place is noteworthy and we will return.  I would have given a 5 but being rushed through the line and the limited amount of drink selections made it a little less than perfect."}
{"text":"I really like the concept of poke bowls and burritos, but where it breaks down for me is the ratio of fish to rice.  Basically there isn't enough fish for the amount of rice.  This makes the texture too dry and the flavor too bland for my particular taste.  I will say the ingredients are always fresh, but I prefer to have standard sushi fare when I'm in the mood for raw fish."}
{"text":"Make your own poke bowl, sushi wrap or salad bowl. Great selection of ingredients... their marinated tuna is like Shoyu Poke. Awesome value at $9.95. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I always wanted to try a sushiritto but they never had a place in town that had it until now. It was a big burrito, I got full off half of it. Personally I prefer a bowl rather than the burrito style, it's much easier to eat but I had to try it. Ingredients were fresh and really good I would come back."}
{"text":"Found this place looking for nearby places for lunch on Yelp. I got a poke bowl with salmon and marinated tuna --- SO GOOD! I would have loved a little more masago in my bowl, but I'll be sure to ask for it next time. There WILL be a next time!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was very clean and the atmosphere was fun and relaxing. The staff was seemed stressed and rushed and it impeded their friendliness somewhat. I got the sushi burrito and it was delicious; the ingredients tasted fresh. Some caution: the green tea is very floral and may taste like perfume to some."}
{"text":"I wanted to love Pokitrition, on paper it's everything I ever wanted. When they had their grand opening, I fully intended to come out and support them however they posted a video of the lines and I was like oh no, I can't wait in a line that long, not even for BOGO and I'm glad I didn't. I thought Pokitrition would be like Jaburrito in Vegas and it almost was just without the flavor and the taste. It's set up like a Chipotle and I went for the poke wrap with white rice,  1/2 salmon and  1/2 spicy tuna. I wish I had just chosen salmon because the consistency of the spicy tuna threw me off and I'm not a sushi virgin or anything, something just tasted off to me. I chose the traditional sesame shoyu sauces with surimi crab as my side, topped with masago, watermelon radishes, and sesame seeds. I couldn't even taste the sauce at all; my wrap was just so dry and flavorless which was super disappointing because I had this place bookmarked from when they were still in their soft opening and was really excited to try it. Literally all I could taste was that not spicy tuna that was a little off and I even opened up my wrap at one point to scoop it out but after that it had no flavor, lol. The customer service was great and the inside is nice and clean and new but I just can't get passed the lack of flavor. Next time I want a poke wrap or a sushi burrito, I'm just gonna stick with Sushi Stop Udon & Grill on Dobson/Guadalupe because for a little bit more, you get a huge serving with a ton of flavor. Sorry Pokitrition. :-("}
{"text":"Freshness. Flavor. Freakin tasty. We had about 30 min to grab grub before a wedding rehearsal and Pokitrition did not disappoint. I forget his name, but the dude w Chicago roots killed it. Made me a marinated tuna and spicy tuna burrito w mango, edamame, spicy crab, and crunch onions. Just a killllller burrito man. Absolutely love this place. Need one in Wisconsin. #PokeWorldDomination"}
{"text":"Poketrition is fantastic.  First time trying the place, so I wanted to try a wrap and a bowl.  We tried various ingredients including tuna, spicy tuna, marinated tuna, and salmon.  ALL were delicious.  You can pay extra for extra fish on your entree, which we did and we loved it.  They have a great variety of toppings and mix-ins to go with the fish and the base (salad, rice, wrap). The Sriracha sauce was awesome!  In short, I'll have to make more trips out to Chandler to have excuses to come back to Poketrition.

Update 5/7/17.  I've been wanting to go back again, and finally was able to yesterday.  Food, again was delish.  Recommend the bowls, we preferred them to the wrap.  Soooooooo good."}
{"text":"I wish there was a place like this at home! My friends had posted pictures of a poke burrito and I had food envy. One of the first things I wanted to do when we arrived in town was get some poke. I was in heaven. You choose your ingredients to add to a rice bowl or rice burrito. They have Tuna, spicy Tuna, shrimp and salmon. Then you add toppings and sauces. It seriously is one of my all time favorite foods. I dream about poke now."}
{"text":"It was first time trying Poki. This place is so close to my house so I had to give a try. I got the shrimp wrap which tasted amazing. If you love shrimp sushi rolls, then you will definitely love this shrimp wrap."}
{"text":"This is another chipotle style fast food place.

Only tried the wrap, but based on that I wouldn't go back.

They use too much sesame oil on the outside of the wrap which makes the wrap feel greasy. The seaweed used for the wrapper was also a little too salty.

They do not have fountain drinks which is strange for a fast food place. 

I also didn't like how everything was room temperature. The water was room temp (not sure they ever added ice to the jug) and worse the raw fish was also room temp.

When I told them I'd like the krab mix, they said that two are included, so I got 2 scoops of krab. But when I asked for seaweed in the next step they told me it would be extra. Afterwards noticed that it did say 2 sides which is either krab and/or seaweed, but since they were in separate sections of the line it was very unintuitive when you are going down the line.

The only redeeming quality was that the service seemed friendly and the place was clean.

I feel that there is a lot of potential for a places like this, but with all the competition in the area for similar fast poke places, I can't recommend this one."}
{"text":"If you enjoy paying $14 for one roll then this is the place. The food was just average at best. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Q:  What kind of fish is made of two sodium atoms?
A:  2 Na.

It's been raining all day. I feel like a drowning fish! I might as well head out and eat some Nemos before running errands. ;)

Pokitrition is a decent place. It's brightly lit, decor is modern, the staff is super friendly and informative, and the eats are clean! Toppings are plentiful and it's all very fresh.  I especially like the mango. I also enjoyed the big chunks of fresh fish and the jalapeños. There doesn't  seem to be a soda fountain so you're stuck buying bottled drinks. They do have a home brewed iced tea that's strong.  I like it when my drinks can deliver a kick.  This place also serves Poké Wraps aka sushi burritos.

With this place being so close to home, I can see myself stopping in here; especially since it's so close to spin class! It starts at $9.95."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Everyone was super friendly and helpful to understand how their system worked.  The food was very fresh and filling and oh so tasty!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We had the Poke Tuna wrap with the works, and a Poke salad bowl. Both were out-of-this-world delicious, so you got no excuse to miss this spot for lunch. Very clean minimalist proletariat dining room - all comrades were making happy with eating of good food...You not belief! I appear to be standing in a big long line of 'Told ya so'... I put a YouTube video up of them making my wrap, called: Biggest Sushi Roll Ever! Told ya! Now you done been told! Shizzle shizzle what?"}
{"text":"Happy to say this was my first poke burrito experience and it was delicious! They just opened this location yesterday and I was happy to try it out. The restaurant is a make-your-own style bowl or burrito, like Chipotle style. I opted for a burrito with spicy tuna and marinated tuna with spicy mayo and sesame shoyu. For toppings I added the spicy surimi, seaweed salad, corn, cucumber, and all the crunchies. Definitely add ALL the crunchy toppings- wontons, fried onions and sesame. It gives a much needed crunch to an otherwise all soft burrito or bowl. The burrito was full of flavor and not so huge or overwhelmingly that you'd feel sick. You could even split a burrito and get a side of miso soup if you aren't super hungry. The staff was super friendly and nice. Highly recommend this place for fresh poke!"}
