{"text":"Below a zip line in the middle of Fremont Street was not where I expected to find delicious, authentic pierogi, but Vegas always surprises me! What a treat. Had the Kielbasa and the cheese and potato pierogi, and both were excellent. The food is prepared to order and pairs well with the beers at Banger. And the pierogi. Mm. Boiled with sautéed onions draped over the top, with a dash of salt and pepper and some sour cream on the side. Just right."}
{"text":"The Pierogis were awesome! The right amount of caramelized onions. The beer Brat on pretzel bun was great too. The menu is not large but, this guy knows what he is doing. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Now that's a tasty sausage! 

Ordered the habanero sausage as I thought it would go good with the El Heffe beer I was drinking and was not disappointed! A little bit of pepper heaven in my mouth right now! 

The sausage comes on a soft and very tasty bun unlike I've ever had before with a sausage.  Only con is that I wish it was twice the size :(  I'd order another but at $8 a pop (the only reason I rated 4 instead of 5 stars) I'll save repeating that heavenly experience for another day..."}
{"text":"I go for the beer at Banger Brewing often. I was pleasantly  Surprised to see king sausage set up on their patio. Once again I had to have the beer brat with the cherry peppers a side of potatoes salad and a jalapeno heffe. King sausage is by far the best home made sausage I have had anywhere. Looking forward to going back. A must if your in DTLV."}
{"text":"Jerry is a wizard of the home made sausage. Every sausage he creates from meat selection to sausage creation to grilling it to serving it perfect to me. Hardworking guy whose product is phenomenal. Can't recommend any more highly. Gotta taste to really appreciate it."}
{"text":"Jalapeño Hefe with the Bratwurst and pretzel bun... Best pairing ever. But looks like the cart has moved on and no longer at Banger Brewing.. Anyone know where he went?"}
{"text":"Kings is hands down best street food in all of vegas. From all this hipster bs food truck propaganda. You have Jerry the King of all foods street in this fair city. Great man cooking and serving food with pride. This is a must stop and eat on your trip to vegas. Weather your local or trying to eat some food before you hit up your VIP bottle service Jerry is the man with the dinner plan."}
{"text":"Sausage lovers must go if you are in Vegas!! They've got so many choices of sausages it was like heaven! 
Our server was a friendly girl with glasses. Can't remember her name, but she offered us the best plates in the house. And I could not disagree, they were the best. So juicy, so delicious you cannot go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"Wonderful menu and food is soooooo good. Made with love. I love the cheese and meat pierogis and the stuffed cabbage rolls are so yummy. The prices are so reasonable. And every time I'm down town I always eat here. If u are craving a great sandwich you must have the meatloaf sandwich. Totally one of my favorite places. Very authentic polish good."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Period. My German fiance and I loved the brats and kielbasa, and the pierogies were fantastic. The owner was very kind and looked in on us as we ate inside Banger Brewery to make sure we enjoyed his homemade sausages with plenty of sauerkraut. Very authentic flavor (according to my fiance) and the owner was just a great person to chat with. Take a friend, look for Banger Brewery, and enjoy a relaxing evening chowing on some excellent sausage."}
{"text":"My wife and I had never had Pierogies until a couple of years ago while visiting Chicago. They were so delicious that we couldn't wait to go back.  Much to our surprise,  we noticed Jerry's little spot one night when we were down on Fremont St.. When we saw Pierogies on his menu, we had to order immediately. They were absolutely delicious and we now have our spot to get Pierogies here in Las Vegas. Thank You Jerry, see you again soon!"}
{"text":"The meatloaf sandwich and pierogi are amazing! Hearty and satisfying with a top-notch comfort food flavor and feel. The food goes perfect with the banger brewing brews!"}
{"text":"Has delicious food! I don't normally frequent too many places but I always see myself coming back. If you're from Nevada or just visiting, this place is an absolute staple!"}
{"text":"A much needed top of the line stuffed cabbage lunch now that the minivacation is over to ward off the 3 day hang over ha !! This is always an office favorite we all love coming here thx for the good grub !"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this food truck more than 5 stars. Absolutely delicious. Pineapple / chicken sausage w/ potato cheese pierogi and potato salad. Omfg mouth watering!!!"}
{"text":"I have been a Patron of the king sausage at Banger Brewery before but I had a party at the bar and asked Jerry to make us a bunch of perogis. he was very accommodating to my large party and the sausages were hot and very flavorful! The sauces he paired with each sauce was perfect. I highly recommend getting sautéed onions on everything! The habanero sausage wasn't too spicy an the chipotle sauce was just spicy enough. The el heffe sausage had lots of cilantro on it which I loved! If you're looking for a chill place to eat and drink please try a beer and a sausage."}
{"text":"Have a pierogi craving? Head over to see jerry!! Potato an cheese .. Sauerkraut and mushroom.. Meat .. Allll ammmaahhhzing!!

The surprise for me was his stuffed cabbage. I have a great Romanian friend in town that makes a similar one for me but only once a year. Now I can have it whenever I want ! Gotta try it!

Last that we've tried was the polish kielbasa ! Hey did I mention it's smoked!? And freshly made by Jerry! Omg on a soft pretzel roll really to die for!! 

I'm glad he's on Fremont tucked away in front of bangers brewery. Just a hop skip and a jump from the synshop hackerspace / home on 4th!"}
{"text":"The meatloaf sandwich and pierogi were reminiscent of dinner with my late grandfather.  Jerry is a fantastic cook who delivers exceptionally fresh homemade Polish food at a great value.  I cannot wait to try his sausages.
Na zdrowie."}
{"text":"Best sausage place!!! Sausages are hand made by the owner..these are seriously the best sausages I've tried.!! U won't regret!"}
{"text":"This food is the real freaking deal! Dont eat anywhere else on freemont. Home made sausages, kielbasa, peirogie and stuffed cabbage. Everything was so flavorful, the man who runs the little shop was so friendly and passionate. Everything is made fresh every day! Dude, go here!!!

You can find this guy nestled behind the outdoor brew vat at the Banger Brewery!"}
{"text":"Jerry is a Polish Prince.  His homemade kielbasa and pirogues are to die for.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"My friend and I have enjoyed a wonderful girl's weeeknd in Las Vegas and we decided to go to Fremont Street for our last night.  I was starving and the Banger's Brewery caught our eye.  I spent my junior year as an exchange student in Poland, so when I saw the offerings of pierogi and kielbasa, I was hoping I was in for a treat.  Jurek (Gerry), with his fresh potato and cheese pierogi and kielbasa with just the right amount of snap, delivered all that I hoped for and more.  His pierogi tasted just like the ones I helped make and eat with my family in Poland.  I also sampled a couple of beers in the brewery, the DBT and May Flower.  The DBT was a great brown, very chocolately and smooth with only a hint of bitterness.  The May Flower was perfumed with jasmine and was the perfect summer brew.  As they say in Poland, Smacznego!!  By? swietny!!  Dzienkuj?!"}
{"text":"Loved the pretzels with mustard and butter!!! Great service and right to the table inside Banger brewery!!"}
{"text":"Awesome!! A must stop if you are in the downtown area.  Handmade sausages and pierogies are amazing. My wife had the beer brat and potato and cheese pierogies and I had the habanero sausage and meat pierogies.  The owner, served us personally and made our experience unforgetable. One of the best meals we've had in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is really only a 3 plus star review, but the owner is such a nice guy I didn't want to be his first under 4 star rating.  We tried the meat pierogies and fond them to be a little above average, they were a bit gritty and didn't pop with flavor; it was only after we tried them that someone said the cheese pierogies were the ones to try.  We also tried the Kielbasa and while the skin was crisped nicely, the sausage itself had dried correspondingly, I suppose he didnt cover or steam the sausage during cooking.  Still it was flavorful.  The same comments could be made about the brats but they were a bit juicier.  The price was about right and the flavor was okay so I will be going back to try the other items people rave about.  It was okay and the owner was great but still do not get you expectations up that you will be astounded, but you will not regret the experience either."}
{"text":"Wow, the four in our group thought the food was incredible! From the Bratwurst sandwich, Pierogis, potato salad with bacon and desert crepes, the food was out of this world! Jerry, the owner took good care of us and we look forward to tracking down his truck anytime we are in Las Vegas. P.S. - Come to the San Fernando Valley, CA!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went into Banger Brewery this past weekend thinking they had a restaurant, but it turns out their restaurant is King's Sausage which is parked out front but will serve the Banger Brewing customers.  This food was absolutely unbelievable.  We were a group of six and when we got there about half of us ordered food.  The food was so good that everybody ended up trying it and when they brought over the bill we sent him back to the grill with a second food order instead.

I ordered the habanero sausage which was incredible.  I also tried the meat pierogies, the cheese and potato pierogies, and the big pretzel.  All of it was worth writing home about.  I honestly don't know if King's Sausage is a permanent fixture outside of Banger Brewing, but I'll make sure to find it where ever it is the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food! Go to bangers brewery and grab a menu on way in. Order a brat out front and have a brew! A+++++"}
{"text":"Glad to see Jerry King Sausage is at Banger Brewing a lot more often these days .  The Guys links are the best around. The habanero on a pretzel  bun is amazing.  Thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously...SO GOOD! I grew up eating pierogi from the women who handmade them in the basement of churches in Cleveland and have never found anything that compared until I found Kings! I stumbled across the truck at the Inspirada farmers market and had a dozen made to order. Absolutely delicious!!"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious and made with love! My personal fave is the meatloaf sandwich. Just do it"}
{"text":"I can't recommend this place highly enough.

I wasn't too hungry, I just wanted a quick and cheap bite. Even though didn't spend very much, the owner treated me like a king (kept checking in on me to make sure I never ran out of sauerkraut)!

Do yourself a favor and get: Cheese pierogies, the polish sausage, and a beer from the brewery...It's both a good deal and incredibly tasty."}
{"text":"hands down best and maybe only polish place in town. Food tasted great,  Kielbasa was outstanding.  The Cheese Pierogi was great I am use to farmers cheese, this was very close.  Overall amazing food!!!  Great Keeshka"}
{"text":"Amazing Perogi's!!! From one polish to another Jerry can sure cook up delicious food!! If I wasn't in public I would have licked my plate clean!!"}
{"text":"What goes better with with a great brew than a great brat and pierogis?  Maybe a polish sausage?  Or even a habanero sausage?  Either way, Jerry makes the best in town. Everything is handmade by Jerry himself and cooked to order. I could easily (and gladly) put down two dogs and an order of his macaroni salad in one sitting.  Cheers King's Sausage!"}
{"text":"Jerry from Kings sausage set up a food truck in celebration of Oktoberfest at my work. Everyone was pleased and happy. He was able to accommodate having a pre-set menu of sausages and pierogies that were absolutely delicious. Thank you so much for coming here!"}
{"text":"Had the chance to eat at this truck tonight. The Perogies were amazing. We had both the potato and cheese and the meat. The dough was amazing. Also had the stuffed cabbage which was delicious. Had two pieces of the bread as well which is like a pretzel bread and it was great to sop up the sauce from the cabbage. What a great change to the usual choices found around town. Keep up the great food!!!"}
{"text":"The owner, Jerry, is from Poland- and he brought his sausages and pierogi recipes with him! There's a trio of flavors for the pierogi, and they're all good but the cabbage and mushroom is my favorite. Whichever you decide on, they're served in the traditional style topped with sour cream and fried onions, and they are comfort food to the max! The bratwurst sausage, dressed with cabbage and mustard, is the perfect compliment to a pint inside at Banger Brewing. Quality is solid, prices are a bit inflated due to the location (5 pierogi for $8!) but not outrageously so- the sausages and sandwiches are generous portions. I'll be back to try the meatloaf!"}
{"text":"Delicious, he's in front of bangers brewing company outside. the brewery doesn't have a restaurant but he'll either serve you inside or outside on the deck. best Las Vegas sausage I ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Had the habanero sausage and assorted pierogis. All of them were delicious and super well prepared!!! This guy knows his stuff."}
{"text":"I've had the brat and polish sausage, along with the potato salad. All of these items tasted great and you could tell they're authentic. The business is located at the entrance of Banger Brewing and any of the food items Jerry's fantastic food  items really compliment the awesome beer from Banger.  I highly recommend you try something from King's Sausage as you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pierogies are outstanding. Soft and delicate with a burst of flavor awaiting on the inside. A must!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Banger Brewery, love microbrews, but we were also hungry....King's Sausage was there and Jerry explained all the amazing things he could make us....they only had a simple chalk board listing his food items, so be sure to talk to the man himself to get the full scoop....his meats and sausages all done by him, all fresh breads, and pieced together to make brilliance by the King.   We had the super burger, bison topped with sausage, habanero sauce with grilled peppers, and the jalapeño bratwurst on a pretzel bun with grilled onions, sauerkraut and a jalapeño beer sauce.  So amazing, the best thing we have tasted in Vegas so far!  Jerry should be on the food network"}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of trying Kings Sausage yesterday and I have to say it was a very pleasant experience. The food was fantastic and the service was impeccable. Jerry was very friendly and provided fantastic customer service. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I promised the owner jerry we'd review his food. ^_^

Visited vegas over the weekend, ready with my bookmarks of delicious looking places I wanted to check out. Kings sausage was #1 on my list.
It's a small food cart literally in front of banger brewery. Delicious.

My boyfriend and I ordered: one bratwurst sandwich, one kielbasa sandwich, one meatloaf sandwich and an order of potato and cheese pierogies. 

We ordered in the front, went inside to sit down and a few minutes later, jerry brought our food over to us. Nice guy.

Everything was delicious! Perfect bar food. Sausages are served on a tasty pretzel roll! I enjoy supporting small businesses that serve out delicious, humble food, like this one. 

Definitely grab a bite here and enjoy a refreshing cold beer while you wait. I'll for sure be going back next time I'm in vegas."}
{"text":"Just had the pierogi and it was fantastic! They were authentic and well prepared and the caramelized onions were cooked to perfection. 

The portion looks small at first but it's filling. I'm stuffed at the moment but I look forward to the next time this food truck stops nearby."}
{"text":"The absolute best sausage in Vegas! Friendly service and awesome food. The buns are like pillows melting in my mouth and the sausage is to die for. Had my first at bangers bar in downtown lv. Come for great beer and the awesome brats!"}
{"text":"We had a birthday party earlier this month and booked King's Sausage for the occasion. We coordinated the schedule and the menu together and Jerry was accomodating and easy to work with. He showed up on time and it was a major success. The food was amazing and everyone had a blast. Djenkie!"}
{"text":"We came across Kings Sausage while playing bingo at Banger Brewing. The food was EXCELLENT!!!  My husband ordered a bratwurst and I ordered the potato and cheese pierogi!!  They were both amazing. I wasn't sure if the pierogi's would be enough but the order of five was very filling!!  I would not hesitate to order this again. Jerry takes great pride in his food and it shows in the quality of his amazing selections!!! I would highly recommend this to anyone who heads to Banger Brewing for a beer!!!"}
{"text":"Omg. If I could say that in Polish I would. I am so grateful to Yelp for finding this food for us!!!!!!! 

JUST like my grandmother and all her many sisters made. And I am too lazy to make because it is so labor intensive. 

Wow. I have lost 100 lbs. and I almost ordered one of everything on the menu. I DID order the pierogis and stuffed cabbage. And I ate every bit. My husband ordered the bratwurst and it was the best he ever had.  

I almost divorced him because he dropped a tiny taste of pierogi on the table as he stole it from me. 

Seriously awesome.   And I don't say that very often."}
{"text":"Yummy Pierogi. Drank some beers inside the banger brewery. The cook was nice to bring our order inside to us. I tried the potato and cheese and the meat both were delicious. They go amazing with beer."}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh made sausages and hand made pierogies. What a pleasant surprise in Vegas, authentic East European comfort food!"}
{"text":"Place is great...we are local and can get to jerry quick like for a brat and the pot sticker deals...things are bomb!!!!....

Can't wait to go back and grub on the meatloaf sandwich and cabbage roll he showed us..."}
{"text":"Best pierogi's in town. Everytime I visit downtown I must stop by and get the sauerkraut pierogi. Goes well with the beer."}
{"text":"King's Sausage came to my office building yesterday (February 1).  I was heading out for lunch and saw him, so I thought I'd save myself some time.  

I had a Kielbasa sausage, which was delicious.  There was a great snap on it; the meat was flavorful, and it was maybe one of the best sausages I've ever had.  However, it was really expensive - $8 or $9 (I can't remember which) for just the sausage.  No side, no drink, nothing.  Just the sausage.  I could have spent the same money at a lot of places in the neighborhood and gotten an equally good meal, and gotten a better bang for my buck.  So, while the food was great, I can't get behind the pricing."}
{"text":"Simple, great food! Try the habanero sausage, spicy but not too overwhelming.  The piergos are homemade and worth a try.  I ended up getting 2 orders!"}
{"text":"Food truck great food very friendly clean \"A\" rated had the brought worst with sauerkraut and spicy mustard on fresh soft pretzel bun it was great!  
Tender juicy full of flavor."}
{"text":"If you like real Polish food, you gotta try Jerry's. He has amazing sausages, Polish dumplings and more good stuff. I highly recommend it, you gotta try it."}
{"text":"So I saw this truck at first Friday and I'm not to big on sausages but my friend is so he got one and I took a bite and WOW best sausage I ever had. The meat was so juicy and the pretzel bread was warm and delicious. There was some type of pickled pepper and mustard on their as well. Every bite was delicious and perfect!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. We had the brat w/ sauerkraut, the habanero brat, and the cheese & potato perogies and they all were the best we've ever had. Paired with the awesome beer at the brewery, we were in heaven. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. I had a hard time choosing what to have because of my terrible indecisiveness, but ended up with stuffed cabbage. Delicious. My friend had the meatloaf sandwich and she seemed to have thoroughly enjoyes it. Everything is better enjoyed with an amazing craft beer, of course :)"}
{"text":"Ok.   So the beer inside is excellent. 
Bartender said to get food from this guy.   Said it was better than excellent.   Apparently he makes his own sausage.   Had the sausage with grilled onions.    Damn it went down very fast.   Most excellent was accurate"}
{"text":"Sausages were great! Chef is friendly. I recommend the habanero, with the chefs recommendations for toppings. He's very accommodating and will let you do half and half, bunless, and will slice it up for you! Yumm."}
{"text":"I have had King's Sausage bookmarked for a good long minute. When I noticed they were one of the food vendors at this years Aviation Nation at Nellis AFB this year, I knew what I'd be having for lunch! This truck by far had one of the longest lines of all the food vendors. The ladies who took my order were so nice. I was given a ticket after placing my order and waited off to the side with the other waiting customers. I had to wait about 10 minutes for my order and there was ketchup, mustard and napkins on a table for customers. 

Potato and Cheese Pierogies ($8) - There was 6 pierogies in the order and they were topped with caramelized onions and sour cream. Good amount of filling inside and very good flavor. Definitely something I'd order again. 

Kielbasa ($8) - The menu said all sausages are served on a pretzel bun. I was able to pick any toppings I wanted and went with caramelized onions, bell peppers and mustard. I thought the sausage tasted good and I love pretzel buns, but felt the sausage could have been bigger to match up with the size of the bun. I was able to bite both ends of the bun before getting any sausage. They have some other sausages on the menu I'd like to come back and try. 

They sometimes also offer burgers and other special menu items. You can check social media to see where they will be next."}
{"text":"Every time I see a food truck, I try to stop by and try the food because they are hard to come by unless I'm in some fest or track them down with food truck websites and drive far.
Today, I was at a farmers market on Eastern (Twin Peak's shopping center) and saw this truck. I was not in the mood of sausages but I somehow I remembered they had good ratings on Yelp so decided to try.
Wow, sausages on pretzel bun?! Never had that before.
I picked the Habanero flavor sausage with everything on it.
Wow, wow, wow. Is this really a pretzel? It's so soft and fluffy in my hand. Fresh like right out of the oven. It's far from my usual pretzels from the mall. 
When I bit into the sausage, meat juice came out from it. Stained my shirt but it's OK. It was freaking amazing. A bit sweet but still habanero spicy. Loved it. 
The sauerkraut, the grilled onion, the pickle and the sauce. Combination of all that in my mouth was Heaven.
The lady that took my order was very nice and talkative.
The only thing is that they are not on roaming hunger or any of that sort of websites. Also, they are not in the same spot every week like some of the food trucks. So, it's really hard to come by when I really want their sausages again. I know one of these days, I will crave their sausage... Sad."}
{"text":"This food truck stops at my work often. I have had the meatloaf and it is excellent . My favorite however is Jalapeno and cheese bratwurst  with bacon potato salad. It is bombdotcom"}
{"text":"The best sausages I have tested and next to the Banger Brewery. It can't get any better."}
{"text":"The Polish bites reminded me of my grandma's food. Especially the pierogi. The beer from the brewery went very well with King's food."}
{"text":"The pierogi's are spot on!  And the bratwurst paired with mustard and sour pickle are awesome"}
{"text":"Had a kielbasa and pork pierogi, boyfriend had habanero sausage. All excellent. F BK, Jerry is the real king."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Polish food in Las Vegas!  We had pork perogies, potato and cheese perogies, cabbage roles, and kielbasa.. Yum!  Everything was fresh and homemade.  Wash it down with one of their yummy craft beers and you are ready to take on the town.   The owner, Jerry was so nice.  The place was humming with happy people."}
{"text":"Tried the potato & cheese pierogi and the beer brat with kraut. Reminded me of my great aunts delicious Polish cooking. The pierogi dough was spot on. The brat is served on a pretzel bun. Everything is homemade and authentic. Kudos to Jerry! We will be bringing family back for more!"}
{"text":"It's a bit of a 3.5, but it'll do.

I've been eyeing King's Sausage during my fairly regular trips to the weekly \"Food Truck Party\" gathering outside Total Wine & More near Fry's, and I finally opted to try them today. It wasn't quite my first experience with them - that happened last year when I shared decent but perhaps overly salty pierogies with friends at another food truck event - but I decided to give it a proper go today.

The woman operating front-of-truck, if you will, recommended the bratwurst when I asked. I decided to order this (presumably listed as beer brats) for $8, and it was prepared quite quickly atop a pretzel roll along with the complimentary toppings that I'd requested: caramelized onions, mustard, and a side of chipotle sauce. I was actually browsing another food truck when she surprised me with my order.

Flavor-wise, the sausage and toppings combine to make everything you'd want in a bratwurst sandwich. I ended up using all of the chipotle sauce too when I realized that it wasn't that spicy, especially when spread atop all the other non-spicy components. Maybe I'll try the pickles next time, although I was concerned for it being too sour. My main gripe was that the pretzel roll became more and more the dominant part of the flavor profile, and on top of that, didn't have quite the chew that you'd want in a good bun.

Perhaps I'll have to give King's Sausage a 3rd try next time. One gentleman nearby seemed about as outwardly impressed by his pierogies as you can be, and I need to double-check with the gentleman from the other food truck on what he specifically likes on this menu. For now, I'm rounding up to 4* because of service and because I tend to expect less from food trucks in truck."}
{"text":"Jerry is the greatest and man can he cook! He has the best food downtown for sure. My boyfriend and I have followed him to his new spot and we are so glad he is serving the best sausage and perogi more days a week. Please go down and check it out!"}
{"text":"King's Sausage is delicious!  We had three sausages and two plates of pierogies on 11/9 and loved it.  We have several food sensitivities (garlic, nitrates...) and usually would have repercussions from such a meal but we both felt great.  The Owner told us that everything was made with quality ingredients and we would definitely agree!"}
{"text":"Pierogies in Las Vegas! Stuffed cabbage in Las Vegas! I stumbled upon my favorites from back home at The Sunday Farmer's Market on Eastern. We were only in that parking lot because we had a Beach Hut Deli craving, but we couldn't pass on pierogies. 

We tried the Potato & Cheese Pierogies. Yum! They were delicate and delicious with buttery grilled onions and sour cream on top. I can't wait to try the rest of the pierogi flavors, sausage, and stuffed cabbage.

We talked to the owner since we wanted to pay compliments to the chef. He said that he is at The Farmer's Market about once a month. Follow him on social media to find out when he'll be at the market. Next time I'm in this area it'll be for King's Sausage!"}
{"text":"I've never been a big sausage fan, but I love these homemade sausages.
I hate sauerkraut, but here it is awesome.
Before here, I had never been impressed by perogies, but these homemade perogies  melt in your mouth.  Jerry is a super nice man so hope he does well. The Banger Brewing brews are a great pairing with King Sausage."}
{"text":"Amazing stuff from a street food vendor. Had the habanero sausage and mushroom-kruit pierogi. Great-great!"}
{"text":"Amazing sausage! So authentic and really nice owner! Friendly staff. I was there
On first Friday and the service was very fast. Great pierogi"}
{"text":"Look, if you are in downtown Las Vegas, do yourself a favor and check this place out!!!! Unbelievable!!! Delicious, and fun to boot! The sausage and pierogies are unbeatable!!!  Wish I could freeze em and take em back to Dallas with me!"}
{"text":"As a midwesterner, I was on the hunt for some authentic pierogies.  In Las Vegas, there are only two places and King's Sausage is one of them. Jerry, who man's the ship, makes everything from scratch, including the sausage!! His homemade soft pretzels even come with his own cheese sauce. He was so personable and answered any questions we had. You can tell this food is his passion!

Hubs and I tried each of the pierogies (cheese&potatos) (sauerkraut&mushrooms) and he got the kielbasa and i tried the habenro. The pickle cooled down the balanced spice of the habenro and Chipotle mayo! As a polish/german gal, I'm ashamed to admit I've never put a pickle with my sausage before. Its damn delicious. The pierogies are as real as they get. 

The added bonus is he is located right in front of Bangers Brewing on the strip. Best food and beer in town!!!  You can't beat it."}
{"text":"This was the best kielbasa I have ever had! Partnered with the micro brew, sitting on the patio and enjoying this delicious food was awesome."}
{"text":"Amongst all the generic, typical fried food or taco trucks at First Friday, to have stumbled upon the Polish food truck harboring pierogi's from heaven was a miracle find in our starving state! Tried the Polish sausage and the meat pierogi's, so delicious, will probably be stalking this truck, seriously, if you see them, get in line!"}
{"text":"I love this food ahhhhhh the best! This has been my dinner many many times!
Hand made, honest food."}
{"text":"Owner is a really nice guy - one man show hidden behind a tank from the microbrewery next door. There's no sign, it's right next to Banger Brewing and Heart Attack Grill. We ordered the habanero, delicious and fresh. The sausage is tasty, roll is soft, served with generous chilli, onions and pickles. Might be kidding myself but it almost tastes healthy! Have a look at the pics - $8 for a sausage sizzle."}
{"text":"Wow!  Picked from reviews and not disappointed. Grabbed a beer from you inside and had a habanero sausage and my lady got pirogues."}
{"text":"Yuck had them at first Fridays the kilbossa had no seasoning and the paroggies tasted and looked like soothing reminiscent of what you would find in a woman's panties during that time of month. Nope never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Polish Perfection served out of a Food Truck. King's cuisine is delicious plain and simple. The owner is friendly, generous, and takes care of his customers. Their short menu includes pierogi, sausages, and a meatloaf sandwich. And you will want to try every item! Everything is homemade! This is probably why everything is delicious and packed with flavor. The kielbasa on pretzel bun with added homemade sauerkraut and peppers is a polish symphony of flavors! The jalapeño sausage and beer brat is also tasty. The pierogi are cooked to perfection. Not doughy or greasy. I was impressed as I ate these quite frequently in Canada. You'll definitely want to try these with sour cream. The dessert pierogi is my gf fave. It is filled and topped with berries. The meatloaf sandwich on wheat bread is so filling and hits the spot. The meatloaf is delicious, juicy, and packed with flavor. I love how homemade food is NEVER bland. This chef is a true Artist. I always order here when I attend Food Truck Frenzy."}
{"text":"What can i say.. This place is awesome grab a beer from the brewery, order yourself a kielbasa and ENJOY!! Everything tastes heavenly good!"}
{"text":"Great food truck! I ate here when they were at Tenaya Creek Brewery. The food was quick and delicious, the owner even hooked me up with some extra sauerkraut because I didn't want the bun on my sausage. Can't wait to try the cabbage wrap. This is a great business - definitely find King's Sausage and give their delicious food a try."}
{"text":"Had a \"dinner\" downtown and needed something more afterwards...stopped by Jerry's stand & wow! It sure hit the spot!! Really enjoyed the habanero sausage and I will most definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Great food.  The quality is very consistent.   German pretzels are amazing.  Who else makes their own sausage in this town?    I trust the ingredients and the prices are good for the quality.   Not frozen foods like all the other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing! The food was fresh, flavorful, and authentic. I was absolutely amazed at how great and filling it was. The owner was very nice and we came back the next night for more. We had pierogies, cabage rolls, and kielbasa. My polish husband even says it's better then mom use to make."}
{"text":"We ordered the kielbasa and the beer brats on a hot pretzel roll with pork pierogis. Everything was on point and we really it. You can also grab a beer next door at the bangers brewery while enjoying your food and jenga."}
{"text":"Review for the brewery beer Part of the place nice friendly service even with Grupon nice professional service Will be back even a bit $$ 4 downtown but what the heck Will be back nice socializing Place..

{"text":"I stumbled onto King's before attending an event at CraftHaus Brewery. It was amazing because I love pierogis so I knew it would be a stop on the way out. The gal running the front of the truck was super friendly and gave me a menu to take. My order was already planned. Potato and Cheese. And the Meat pierogi. 

When we made our way back to the truck after some small beer samplings, I was saddened to learn they were out of the potato. Devastated actually. I'm still crying. The beef pierogis were incredible. Soft and tender. Served with some sour cream and caramelized onions. I enjoyed them once I got home, so even luke warm, I was in heaven. 

I plan on stalking this truck all around town. I will get my hands on those Potato and Cheese pierogis, if it's the last thing I do. I'll of course order the meat again too. I'm crazy like that."}
{"text":"Best Polish food in town! Right outside Banger Brewing - you get great with with amazing food! Perogis, brats, meatloaf sandwiches - all phenomenal. Perfectly spiced and flavorful! Great food, amazing beer and people watching - a perfect evening!"}
{"text":"Jerry has a food truck now! And a few new pierogi flavors, and a burger with homemade bacon that's pretty frickin awesome. I just tried the spinach & meat pierogi and I think they're my new 2nd favorite after mushroom/sauerkraut. A few items have increased ever so slightly in price, likely to help cover the costs of the truck. Still totally worth it, but just be aware the prices in my previous review may not be accurate anymore. To find his truck's location on any given day, you'll need to find & follow him on Instagram under the same business name."}
{"text":"I would have ordered the pierogies but I had some for lunch so I went a different route. I got the burger and holy cow it was amazing! So juicy, full of flavor with a slight kick. I loved it! I will definitely eat with this truck again EVERY TIME I see it. Thanks to Lovelady Brewing for them them here tonight."}
{"text":"Usually when I hear that a place has great pierogies, I'm pretty skeptical because I had a Slovak grandma who could cook and I haven't had any food that compared to her cooking.  Until now.
I ordered the potato and cheese pierogies and a Kielbasa sandwich.   Totally out of this world.  Jerry makes his own cheese (!) for the pierogies and his dough is spot-on.  Truly spectacular.
He makes all the sausage himself, too.  The result is juicy, flavorful goodness.  Jerry's philosophy is simple: make the best food using the highest quality, freshest ingredients and people will come back. 
If you are looking for amazing food, this is the place.  And you will love meeting and talking to Jerry, too."}
