{"text":"Let me start by saying I am not a picky person... But when 3 of the 4 plates on our table had dried food still on them ( mine actually had a cement dried chunk of chicken glued to the back of it )... I figured I had to write something.  The sheer filth didn't stop there... I took my kid into the bath room only to discover it hadn't been cleaned in something close to 10 years... My shoes were sticking to the floor from the stagnate urine, there was no towel paper and poop still in the toilet bowl.  After returning to the table, the waiter came over to apologize in broken English to tell me the dishwasher was really backed up... We ended up leaving as I couldn't eat another bite... This place is great if your looking for cheap and want to attempt getting food poisoning."}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese restaurant. Always great food. Best pork fried rice. They treat you like their friends (or family). Rather it's for lunch, dinner in or take out I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, every time. We are so glad we live close to this place. The quality is much better and more consistent than others we have tried since moving to AZ. Dine in and carry out, this place is fantastic!"}
{"text":"So decide to try this place on a whim and boy was it the biggest mistake of the day.  Walk in around  lunch time and  was greeted and seated right away.  My boyfriend ordered the orange chicken and I got the sweet and sour chicken.  The lunch specials come with the following egg drop soup / iceberg lettuce w/ ranch / an over cooked bland egg roll / cream cheese puff / brown white rice ( its supposed to be fried rice) and then the main dish.  Its a lot of food for $4.95 but its gross.  The orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken had so much breading that you really didn't know if it really  was chicken.  My daughter had to use the bathroom and it was dirty and we saw a roach on its back alive.  Also the lights are so dim in there that its hard to see.  Maybe they did that on purpose.  I would NEVER go back here again... Don't waste your money..... Panda's would have been a BETTER choice.  I left hungry and disappointed..."}
{"text":"We've never had a bad meal at Chen's!  Usually pick up our order and they are always fast, accurate and yummy!  Our favorites are kung pow chicken, sweet and sour chicken, Mongolian beef, fried rice, Also love their egg rolls and crab puffs!"}
{"text":"Actually I was pleasantly surprised by this place. We were on the way to the swap meet but we were hungry so we stopped here first. The fried orange tofu was pretty good and when I asked if they can add broccoli to it, they did and without a charge ! Staff were nice as well and it was pretty busy here on the weekend. You can actually sit down and enjoy your meal here...I hate that chinese places are only takeout spots with maybe 2 tables and everyone coming in stares at your plate of food while hovering over it as they stand in line. Cant stand that !
 Oh, and the veggie eggrolls were a little cold inside and they were just ok...but everything else was good.
They have cheap lunch specials too.
Probably be back if we are in the area again !"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS.  (If I only could)
 FOOD- no taste.  White soy sauce rice for \"fried rice\".
Too much batter on the honey chicken. And when I got to the chicken it tasted boiled and weird.  
Tasteless egg roll.   
I work in the complex and even for convenience,  I will NEVER go back.  
And the friendly service-Not so friendly.  I called in the order and when I showed up a few minutes later they seemed put out that I was early.  A nice lady was also waiting for soup to go asked if I had ever been there.  I explained it was my first time and asked how she likes the soup.  She asked the owner to give me a sample.   They again seemed, put out.   I felt unwelcome.....
Will steer all my clients away from them.   Even if they want cheap.   Which is all this place is.   Is cheap."}
{"text":"Wonton were doughy and brother was like wsrm. Ordered an egg roll and it was cold. Lettuce were average.
Will not come back"}
{"text":"Yummy and the dinner for 2 will feed at least 5 just add extra egg rolls."}
{"text":"Bad place to eat, tastes like dog food, bland and no taste, I swear they use canned dog food or some garbage, this place I will never go to again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is so good. My 2nd time ordering in 2 weeks. Try them out. We got the pineapple chicken and Kung pao shrimp. Both were so tastey. They are a little skimpy on the meat so ask for extra. :-)"}
{"text":"It used to be really good but not anymore.  Sorry guys! :("}
{"text":"Great food!  Called in for pickup.  Was hot and ready when I arrived in only 15 minutes.  The Lemon Chicken was great.  They even let us substitution some items for the dinner for two.  Definitely will be eating their Chinese food again, only we'll eat there for the sit down experience."}
{"text":"Loooved, LOOOVED the service & esp the FOOD!!!

My daughter & I \"stumbled\" upon this place, after not being able to find the Chinese restaurant we WERE looking for. Tired & hungry, we decided, \"What the heck!!!\"
Sooooo glad we did!!! (Stumble in, that is!)

The service was excellent! \"Johnny-on-the-spot!\" It's a pretty small place so they can see all of their customers, but I've been in small restaurants before and still got \"lost\" to non-observant servers. Not so here! The servers were at our side whenever we needed anything! Refill of our drinks, serving the food, clearing our empty dishes, offering \"to-go\" boxes, etc. ( The server overheard my daughter saying, \"I wonder what their other (spicy) soup tastes like?,\" even tho she was already slurping up her Egg Drop soup. The server immediately brought a lil cup of the other soup for my daughter to sample. (And DIDN'T charge us for it!) Now that's good service!

But the BEST part of our meal was the food!!! NOT only was it DELICIOUS, served JUUUST the way we ordered it (since I'm such a darn finicky eater!!!), but the servings were plentiful!!! HUGE portions! Overflowing the platter, even!!! There was soooo much food leftover from the 2 of us, we were able to make 2 full additional plates to take to work for our lunches the next day! (With the big container of rice they serve with every dinner meal, we were able to divide the rice & the 2 different dishes we ordered (Teriyaki Chix & Lo Mein) into 2 sep 3-course meals! Yum-yum for our next day's lunch!)

The place was clean, prices more than reasonable, & service excellent! It was a very pleasant \"accident!!!\" Highly recommend!
(Just ignore the lil kids next door learning Martial Arts! Hey...they have to learn somewhere...and it added to the \"ambience!\" Lol)

Now the only problem is...it's in Mesa, and we live clear across town! Bummers we don't live closer! This would be my \"go-to-place\" for Chinese food!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really good, I'm from San Fransisco bay area and thought China town had the best now I have finally found Chinese the way that it should be.

Portions are large and the Chicken fried rice is the best, all the food is fresh and they are fast. 

Servers are nice, and the decor is sparse, but the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"We place to go orders at Chens a few times a month and couldn't be happier. Our food is ready in about 10 min from hanging up and always hot! You can't beat a lunch special for $4.95 and it's huge! This place is always packed. Good food, reasonable price and if you want a dish done differently, all you have to do is ask ( nothing here is very spicy, but if you ask for it to be spicy, they are happy to add the heat, etc.)"}
{"text":"I am also from San Francisco and I have to disagree with theother SF Bay Area reviewer.  I've only eaten at Chen's twice and was disappointed both times.  The vegetables were overcooked and the dishes lacked flavor overall.

I do agree that the portions are a good size.."}
{"text":"We went here Sunday night and we had WONDERFUL FOOD!  Crab angels first, 10 of them SUPER!  We shared fried rice and Lemon Chicken.  PERFECT!  great food and have leftovers all for $25.  Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Just moved back to Az and ended up here in Mesa. This place is close to our house and we usually get take out. Food is fresh and plentiful. We used to live in Seattle and had many choices that were excellent and never found a good Chinese food place when we lived in Scottsdale a few years ago. 
They were very nice, too. Also, while waiting for food they seemed to be very attentive to the people who dined in.
The owner/manager seemed aware of what was going on and wanted to make sure everyone was pleased."}
{"text":"Most everything is tasty, though if you like the fried stuff, the sesame chicken is their defining dish. Coated in sesame seeds and a very wet honey, each bite draws you in... Until there is nothing left. Dont expect much personality from the servers/cashier, unless you're in the \"older\" crowd. The food is also done in about 10 minutes, regardless of time of day."}
{"text":"Mediocre.   Wonton soup as best thing I had.  Ordered sesame chicken and it was deep fried ---yuck!  Fiance ordered chicken chop suey which was salty. Not worth the drive to east Mesa."}
{"text":"First time here tonight. The service was great and a smile on there face! Very friendly staff. The prices are average and the inside is clean. The food was good. Everything tastes really good from the soup to the appetizers to the entr√©es. If we're in the  again we will stop in for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"While the dining experience lacked substance and a more \"updated\" decor, I was pleasantly surprised by both the dishes we ordered to our table, as well as the appetizers (egg rolls and pot stickers).   Our waitress(s) were both very courteous, as well as polite.  Priced reasonably. Seems to be family owned, and our servers were also eating lunch at another table.   Four stars all the way for the food, minus a star for the decor (and) the fact that they do not deliver to my house which is very close.  I'm from the SF Bay Area, so I know real chinese food and this comes pretty darn close to that level of an experience."}
{"text":"The food ad no flavor and the foods that say spicy have no heat the only good thing was pot stickers"}
{"text":"My fiance and I love good Chinese takeout (especially if they're open late). Being new to the area, we hopped on Yelp and decided to try Chen's... we were not disappointed. Good portions, fresh, and great for leftovers. Everything we've ordered has tasted great!"}
{"text":"Probably the most inconsistent Chinese rest I've ever eaten at.  The food ranges from alright to absolutely awful.  You can go there 3 times  a week and order the same dish.  It will never be the same.  It's like they are just winging it.  They also use a lot of canned vegetables.  The meats are un-marinated or seasoned and usually taste terrible.  

You'll be served a glutenous snot-like soup to start.  Better dump a ton of soy in it so that it tastes o.k.!  Also you get a \"salad,\" which is actually a half-cup of ranch dumped on 2 pieces as lettuce.  The only things you can trust will be acceptable is the Sweet and Sour.  It is over-breaded, but crunchy.  Maybe it's the sauce that covers up the awful meat?  The Egg Foo Yong can be good, depending on what random vegetables they will be using that day.  Everything else is a crap shoot.

I've been there far too many times and only rarely enjoy it.  This is the only chinese restaurant in the area.  I think that is what keeps them going.  It's definitely made for older folks who like bland mild food.  

Also, there staff are not talkative or friendly.  There have been times where they are just counting the minutes until you leave so they can quickly start vacuuming under your table while you are standing up.  If you want good Chinese, it's worth driving to Chou's Kitchen.  In fact, you're better off eating at Panda Express. At least Panda Express is consistent!"}
{"text":"Chen's is pretty good! We ordered family style & the orange chicken was probably my favorite. Portions are large! The restaurant is a good size, very comfortable, and was busy on Saturday night. Ask for a side of the lemon sauce, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Chen's has pretty good Chinese food - my family and I are fans of the lemon chicken and General Tso's chicken. There are other staple favorites - the mooshoo wraps, angel crabs and egg drop soup are all great.

The atmosphere has changed since it's been under new ownership/management. The new owners aren't as friendly and seem to rush you when you order. The portions are still healthy and big, though. The take-out service is VERY fast - within 10 minutes your food is ready and you still get complimentary rice.

As far as the setting, they have new upholstery which has definitely modernized their look a bit."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the beef kabobs, an egg roll, veggie lomein, and General tso's chicken. The kabobs were limp and flavorless, I may try to doctor them up tomorrow with loads of BBQ sauce. The kabobs were filled with grizzle. The general tso's chicken was also soggy, while not flavorless I could not get past the texture. I had two bites of it and resorted to eating the white rice. I've been craving Chinese for about a month now, and now I'm still craving Chinese food. Literally the worst food I've ever paid for in my life! If I could give a half a star I would because the guy on the phone was nice."}
{"text":"I have driven by Chen's Chinese Restaurant countless times. I was craving Chinese food so I decided on going to Chen's. I have been looking for a new Chinese restaurant   to add to my cycle of restaurants. This is defiantly a place I will go back to; here is why:

Price- We went for lunch and the price was very low for how much food we got. I did not even come close to eating all my food. I don't know what their dinner prices are but there lunch prices are fantastic. 

Food - The food was spot on! Do I need to say more??

Service - My water cup got refilled multiple times before I was empty. We didn't have to wait for anything. It was how service should be at any restaurant."}
{"text":"Good. But, make sure you ask for no MSG as you need to at any Chinese restaurant. I didn't and now I'm feeling the effects. Boo! No leftovers for me. :("}
{"text":"I am a lover of Chinese food, and am always on the prowl for a tasty new place that is close. This place fit the bill nicely!

Started with the Egg Flower Soup: The flavor was good (it did require a little pepper) and I enjoyed that they added water chestnuts to the soup.

For the Entree I went with the Lemon Chicken: Battered then fried chicken over a bed of cabbage with sweet lemon sauce. The sauce was perfect, YuM! The entree did come with white rice as well. 

The server was nice enough, and if you dine in there really isn't much to look at (couple tables & booths.) I suggest just order take-out and eat the delicious food in the comfort of your home."}
{"text":"Ate lunch there and wish I hadn't.  Worst food I've ever eaten. Lean Cusino in freezer section is superior."}
{"text":"I mean, it's edible... Would I ever crave this? Most likely not. My husband, brother-in-law and I all ordered different dishes and none of us were impressed."}
{"text":"Not bad... better than panda but not by much. Their \"fried\" rice that comes with the lunch special is hardly fried. Tastes like they poured soy sauce over white rice stirred it and called it good. The bbq pork chow mein wasn't horrible."}
{"text":"Chen's reminds me of when I first moved to Arizona back in 1994 and could not for the life of me find any decent Chinese Food (took me 2yrs, to be honest).  Here's a hint that makes Chinese Food great . . . FLAVOR!!!  Which Chen's has none of.  Forget the soy sauce, I literally had to put salt on it to get even a hint of flavor.  

I ordered some usual staples: pot stickers, house fired rice, house lo mien and some egg foo young.  The pot stickers  were about the only thing that was half-way decent, but everything else was as bland as white rice on top of more white rice.  Not to mention, this is one of those places that has no clue how to make decent egg foo young - ingredients should go inside the patty, not drizzled all over the top, thus the patties were dry and chewy.  Overall, it is one of the worst Chinese Food experiences I've had and I'd pay money to see Chef Ramsey rip the place apart."}
{"text":"Absolutely Ridiculous!  Ordered take-out and it was wrong...fine.  Called...went back.  He was holding what he said was the right thing...thought it was great that he was waiting with the \"right\" order.  Left...all the way home and AGAIN discovered it to be WRONG....come on really.  Back again...there he was with money back in hand as if to admit \"yeah, we suck\". But instead \"it's been a big night.\". Please...not a lot of choices out here in East Mesa but been going to this spot for years...not anymore."}
{"text":"I've been wanting some Chinese food for quite awhile and tonight I ordered from Chens with DoorDash Delivery. You can bet I will be ordering again!  My wife and I are very impressed with the freshness of the veggies and the shrimp/scallops I had and her Chicken w/Cashews are delicious.  The order was delivered quickly and it was hot!  This is what we ordered.

{"text":"As most of the other reviewers have stated, Chen's has good food, sparse decor, big portions, and great prices. I have come across a couple of decent \"hole in the wall\" Chinese places that are similar to this one, however Chen's is a bit more upper-scale than most in this category. It's VERY clean, well-lit, and the staff members are friendly and unusually fluent in English (That's a fact not a slam of any kind, BTW).

The egg-drop soup is soup is the best that I've had anywhere, at any price!!!! I put a few drops of soy sauce in it.... stir..... and WOW!!!! 

The lunch specials are a great value and include an entr√©e, soup, a tiny salad, and an egg-roll. 

Many of the dishes that I've had elsewhere are served here, with a dark sauce rather than a light sauce. I find that I prefer that!

I LOVE this place!!!"}
{"text":"Love Chen's super fast and tasty. Haven't had anything bad here. Perfect for those nights where you just don't want to cook and you're hungry now."}
{"text":"So I do like this place I really do. The food is good but not great. I am a big fan of the sweet and sour chicken. The soups are a little bland but that's not the reason I eat CHINESE food anyway. I would recommend this place as a decent cheap quick fix if you are craving Chinese food."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting my mom and we got takeout from this location. We ordered Mongolian beef, spicy shrimp and shrimp egg foo young. It was edible but I thought the portions were small and the food was bland.  The egg foo young was weird--very small and tasted like a veggie burger."}
{"text":"Wow, for a fast food Chinese place, this is actually pretty good. Lunch specials are very reasonable and you get a lot of food, including soup, cheese rangoon and an egg roll in addition to your main item.  Good flavor and attentive waiter to refill drinks.  Overall, I good place to go."}
{"text":"My husband ordered some shrimp fried rice. He then asked for more soy sauce and the waiter tells him it's already some in the bag. My husband asks can he have some more and the waiter reply so he is only going to give him 2 more in a nasty way. My husband gave him a ten dollar bill placed it in his hand he in turn places my husband change on the counter and not in his hand while he had his hand out. Made my husband feel small and he felt they were being prejudice and didn't want to touch his black hand.
NEVER EATING THERE AGAIN. WHAT NERVE"}
{"text":"Tried this place when I first moved here and was underwhelmed. They said they have \"crab putts\" and discovered that it's actually just cheese puffs. When I asked they said people don't want crab. Umm yes, yes, we do. Offer cheese or crab & cheese. Their Kung pao was ok but they only offer white rice to accompany with no option to sub fried rice. They suggested buying a whole order of fried rice which I did and it was tasty but I would've liked to have not had to buy an entire order as none of my family cares for white rice that ultimately got tossed. The sweet and sour was standard. I have since discovered that finding awesome Chinese food is a challenge around these parts."}
{"text":"Great food, fast and attentive service, good prices. It's not upscale or fancy, but Chens beats the Panda Express option easily."}
{"text":"Love the Wonton soup here and the staff is very friendly and timely.  I grew up in NY, and it's not the authentic Chinese food I got back home but it is very tasty."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the east valley. Best service in the east valley. (Orange chicken) (house rice) (Mongolia beef)"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place and now that I have it's going to be added to my go to place for Chinese. Since moving to the area it's been very hard to find any decent fair priced Restraunts that aren't chains. My only complaint was that the food came out to fast, would have liked to finish my soup & salad before the main dish came. The lunch prices were right on and will be returned often."}
{"text":"Like many have stated, Chen's serves Americanized Chinese food. That isn't to suggest that it isn't good. In fact, it quite good. We were promptly seated and given menus. 

The establishment is well kept and not too noisy. Friendly service of the mom and pop shop gives the place a comfortable feel. Appetizer soups came out only a minute after ordering, and by the time we finished our cups of soup, our HOT meals were on the table!

The pan fried noodles were a little on the salty side, but tasted really good. The beef with snow peas was really good, especially after adding some chili sauce (which I asked for separately). Portion sizes definitely worth the money, and it's relatively inexpensive anyways. 

I would eat here over Panda Express any day! Better taste, waiter service, quieter and the personal touch of the owners running their business. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great food with fast service. Sadly this doesn't have the same flavors on generals chicken like I do, but I go back because of the service"}
{"text":"Most delicious hot and sour soup I've ever eaten! I  I went in to order some hot and sour soup. I get it from several restaurants around and the price is between 450 to 650. There's was seven dollars. I said wow that's expensive. THey said well you need to try it. It was the best hot and sour soup I've ever eaten well worth the money. It add beef, shrimp and the best brown broth. Definitely 5 star!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for carryout the other night for the first time. I ordered the general tso, orange chicken and some egg rolls.

The tso chicken was extremely breaded. It had an unusual flavor to it I couldn't place. It appears they use dark meat for it and not white breast. I found a bone in one of the pieces about half way through eating it. That pretty much ruined the rest of the meal for me. 

I haven't found a bone in my Chinese food for nearly 30 years. I eat out for Chinese about 36+ times a year.

The egg rolls were OK. For a $1.50 I at least expected a shrimp or pork egg roll but it was vegetable. 

The sweet and sour sauce was kind of bland. My wife said the orange chicken was below average. 

Everyone was polite who worked at the restaurant.

Prices to me were on the higher side for the portion size and quality.

I definitely won't be back. When I find a bone in my food that pretty much permanently turns me off of a place to eat."}
{"text":"Solid choice for Chinese. Service is always fast, friendly and efficient. My go to place several times per week."}
{"text":"My daughter and I love Chens Chinese food.  They have great service and food. The portion sizes are perfect.  I recommend Chens to people all the time."}
{"text":"I gave this place one star because the waitress was nice. When I pulled up I only saw old white people. That told me what was confirmed when I ate there. The food is HORRIBLE. Don't ever eat there if you want food that has taste. I had shrimp fried rice and broccoli with garlic sauce. The shrimp was rubbery and the sauce on the broccoli was - I'm still trying to figure out what it was.
I will continue to search for good Chinese food."}
{"text":"We've ordered from Chen's several times and the food has always been piping hot and tastes good after we get it home.

My only complaint is that the prices seem too high for what you receive in return. For example, we usually order the Happy Family entree and there are way too many mushrooms and not enough chicken, shrimp and beef. 

We are big fans of shrimp egg foo yung and the way they make it here is different than most of the Chinese restaurants I've been too.

Their food is definitely good, just be prepared too fork over as much as $65 if you buy 4 dishes and a few egg rolls!"}
{"text":"Nice little mom and pop. Good price, good food. I would say the food is better than average for Chinese in this part of town. I will definitely be going back. Lunch menu comes with soup and salad to start and an egg roll and cheese ragoon with the meal. So if you are looking for \"Panda\" there is one across the street, but I prefer the mom and pop."}
{"text":"Price for lunch special ($7) is the only reason this place gets 2 stars. I should of trusted the poor review I read, food was plain, chicken was spongy, and the spring roll in the lunch special was undercooked and soggy. I think this was a meal heated in a microwave before we picked it up. Our family will not return to Chen's."}
{"text":"Food is OK for price.  Not disappointed by any means but definitely no WOW WHAM BANG gotta have more, will probably visit again in a year or two."}
{"text":"Not a traditional Chinese restaurant. Very cheap but not very good. I've had better food at Panda Express."}
{"text":"This is such a disappointing place, it's in a great location to be a quick lunch spot but the food is so sub par that I would rather be hungry. I went in for lunch and ordered the broccoli and beef. My order came with a salad that was basically poorly washed iceberg and a couple table spoons of off brand ranch dressing. If this is your best attempt at a salad it would be better not to have it. My order came with fried rice which was really just mushy white rice with soy sauce tossed in - I ended up walking out after seeing what I was being served. I felt insulted like this restaurant doesn't think their customers are worth the effort.                                                                      I was actually embarrassed for them - can you imagine having a Chinese restaurant and being so lazy that you can't even make fried rice correctly. Shame - needless to say I will not be going back"}
{"text":"Really enjoy the lunch specials when we have time to dine in.  Soup, salad, and entree.  Mongolia beef, shrimp chop suey for lunch.  Plenty of tables to enjoy."}
{"text":"Friendly prompt service. Food is always cooked to order and servered fresh and hot! Great prices; super value. My go to lunch spot."}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving Chinese food today, so we decided to try this place based off of the decent reviews and word of mouth from a friend of mine.  First off they are very friendly, and the restaurant itself is very clean looking.  I have had some terrible experiences at other Chinese places so I always get nervous to try new ones.. But I was beyond satisfied when I tasted the food!  One of the best places I have tried yet in the east valley and I was extremely impressed.  Sometimes I have gotten food that was soggy, cold, or just plain bad (food poisoning).. This food was the complete opposite.  It tasted fresh, nice and hot, and they got it ready in such a timely manner also.  When it comes to price, you can't beat that either.  The portions are great sizes and we ordered a few different things so I would say I couldn't imagine anything not tasting great there.  All in all, I had a great experience (got the food to go) and I will be ordering again in the future!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre.  If I want chinese really badly, I'd still go somewhere else.

Avoid the egg fu young.  It's floury like bisquick  instead of eggs.  Nasty.  Also the meat isn't in the patties, so I assume they're premade.  I assume it all is, actually."}
{"text":"Not to bad for a quick meal while craving Chinese food, however it certainly isn't comparable to some of the other places around town.  I personally wasn't to pleased with the quality of food here, and more than likely won't return."}
{"text":"Love Chen's! There food is very good, place is always packed with people.  Tonight we enjoyed Orange Chicken, Lo Mein,  Chicken, Fried Rice, and Crab Ragoon"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and love this place.   Inexpensive, good tasting food with super and quick service.  

Love the orange tofu and lemon chicken."}
{"text":"For what they do, Chen's is very good.  Straight up American Chinese food with no pretense.  I've even done phone orders while reading off another American Chinese restaurant's menu.  If you're looking for a nice tub of fried rice or Chicken Teriyaki to nosh on with a few egg rolls then you have arrived.

Eating in is very enjoyable.  It's simple, clean, well-kept and usually has families in there which gives it a nice feel.  The staff is helpful and efficient.

We usually do take-out and usually on Friday evenings.  I don't care when you call and I don't care how much you order, it will be ten minutes.  Also, the guy on the phone will talk spectacularly fast.  Just say, \"Order for pickup\" then give your order next, then say thank you, hang up the phone and show up there ten minutes later.

I haven't had everything here but I've had several different things and they were all good.  Portions were on the larger side, which is EXACTLY what you want when you are a guy and suddenly hungry for Chinese food.

Keep up the great work, guys."}
{"text":"I was hoping Chen's was going to be good, as there aren't many Chinese food options available on this side of town. Sadly, I'll probably never eat here again.  I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and House a Special Fried Rice.  While the presentation was nice and everything looked fresh, the Kung Pao was very bland.  Kung Pao is supposed to be spicy and this didn't even have a hint of spiciness. The House Special Fried Rice was also very bland. It even left a weird aftertaste in my mouth. The portion sizes were very large, but with food that is virtually tasteless, what's the point?  I can't comment on the service as I got this order to go. They seemed friendly, but the bland food is what is going to deter me from going there again."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, and I really don't have any specific gripes...the staff was very friendly, take out service was fast, order was perfect, price was ok (seemed a little high, but reasonable I suppose).  Just didn't seem like it had much flavor.  Service was 4 stars, food was 2 stars. A 2 star rating for \"Meh. I've experienced better\" seems to fit. Food certainly wasn't bad...whole family ate it just fine.  Just was...unremarkable.  I usually devour leftover Chinese food, and some of this sat in the fridge and went bad because I just had zero desire to reheat it.  I feel bad about not liking it, and I really hope others do.  I'll probably try it again, just wish I'd been blown away.  Have just had too many others that were way better."}
