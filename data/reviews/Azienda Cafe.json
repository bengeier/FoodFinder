{"text":"This place is great! Probably some of the best carrot cake I've tasted. I go for the matcha latte and the occasional breakfast sandwich. It's hard to find matcha without sugar, but they've got it. They also have a variety of non-dairy milk options, which is pretty awesome. Even better, the staff are always very friendly. They make you feel right at home. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered The Bellwoods described as a roast chicken sandwich with bacon and cheddar cheese.  It's on the extreme salty side especially because it came with bacon and cheese.  It also took 20 mins when the cafe was completely empty and two staff members.  I asked what kind of meat is in the Bellwoods sandwich and he said it's a deli type meat.  I said that's very deceptive and his respond was that it's still roast chicken.  I do not recommend their sandwich and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I won't lie to say that the vibe of this cafe is a little confusing off the bat. The place has a design opens up the space, and makes it seem incredibly inviting, along with tons of light that comes in on a sunny day. I came on a Saturday, and the other customers seem to most be older people, drinking beers in the middle of the day. In addition, they had a poker tournament on the TV (or something that seemed like it). I wasn't sure what kind of vibe they were going for, but they definitely had me puzzled. This is definitely somewhere that would be a good study spot, with many tables, and plenty of natural light.

I only had a latte, which wasn't anything to be wowed by. The espresso seemed overwhelmed by the milk. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to grab anything to eat, as the counter had a nice array of desserts. I'm definitely intrigued enough to come back here and try another cup of coffee, since it's conveniently located along College."}
{"text":"I ordered the Montrose sandwich on whole wheat, it's the roast beef sandwich and it was DELICIOUS! The beef was so tender and juicy and they give you a hearty amount of meat. I highly recommend it, as well as the berry iced tea lemonade. The prices are great and so is the food and workers."}
