{"text":"Had my first visit for lunch today. I was highly impressed. Oysters & shrimp were very fresh and they have a great oyster section. Bartender was very attentive and friendly. Pearl will def be added to my favorites list of places to dine!"}
{"text":"Same great food as the flagship in Charleston. Great bartenders and waitstaff. One of my favorites."}
{"text":"Everything we tried was delicious! Started with white wine and oyster shooters (which were amazing), then had the house oysters on a half shell, I got shrimp and grits and my mom got the tuna tartar. Finished up with the sliced bread pudding. Service was great - fast and friendly! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Pearlz is awesome! The oysters are always fresh and you honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My wife LOVES their Shrimp & Grits and always ends up eating way more than she wants too! :)

The restaurant isn't especially large, so there will likely be an extended wait on the weekends. My advice is to grab a couple seats at the bar, as all the bartenders are great. 

Keep an eye open for Brussels & Mussels as a daily appetizer special. It is, without a doubt, one of the best things you'll ever eat! Simply amazing tasting!!!"}
{"text":"I had been here many times before and the service was always great. This time however, service was outstanding. Lizzie, the new server, really made me and my friends feel like we were royalty. She was personable, charismatic, and knowledgeable. We will be back to see her and try the lunch seafood platter!  Thanks for an incredible experience."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and had the lobster roll.  Wow!  Full of lobster.  Would rival any Maine lobster roll.  Definitely a must.  Apparently the chef is from Massachusetts.  I'll have to see how the crab cake stands up next time."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and had a taste for a lobster roll. Thankfully my waitress Lizzie recommended it to me! It was delicious and her service was incredible - a perfect balance of attentive, yet not hovering! I'll definitely be back and hope to see Lizzie again!"}
{"text":"Best oysters in Charlotte. When it opened up 2 blocks away from a competitor, I was curious how it would compare. But the oysters were delicious! Only disappointing thing we're that of the 3 dozen we ordered probably 5 of them were extremely extremely small and shouldn't have made it onto the plate. I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"What can I say?  I have a mutant for a 9 year old that likes to eat raw oysters.  A friend had recommended Pearlz Oyster Bar and we were not disappointed.  To start, their service is excellent.  We had a minimal wait.  We did go at 5:30 and the place was starting to fill up.  Our meal began with a variety of incredibly fresh oysters from New England and the west coast. Having lived in Boston and tried about every oyster dive around, there is no doubt that the manager, Chad, is passionate about getting the best possible oysters around. He has connections up the coast and this has paid off for the patrons.  Furthermore, the chef took it a step further and brought us a round of doctored oysters with gouda cheese and bacon.  There is no doubt Pearlz looks to be creative, and more importantly care about not only the meal, but also the experience.  A good raw bar needs a variety of beer to go with the meal.  Pearlz does not disappoint with a selection of local drafts from the up and coming Charlotte brewery scene.  

My dinner was the Seafood grill sampler.  Nothing fishy here.  Fish was fresh and was not overcooked. Again, the selection was excellent.  My wife got the fried shrimp platter and enjoyed the corn fritters.  One of my kids got the fish and chips.  Very large portion with one piece the size of a small baby's arm.  We shared the chocolate creme brûlée which was also excellent.

Bottom line is that if you are looking for a good food experience, excellent raw oysters, and a thoughtful and creative menu, then Pearlz is a good choice any night of the week."}
{"text":"The hubby and I had an impromptu Monday date night at Pearlz. We had lunch here last year when we first moved to Charlotte and weren't impressed but decided to give it another try and this time it did not disappoint. The Monday specials were great! $3 champs and $12 baked oysters were a hit. We loved the clams and the hubby's pan seared salmon was cooked perfect. I had the cod sliders and was impressed by the flavor combination with the butter pickles and bacon. Who doesn't love bacon?!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner there last night. We had the tuna poke and shrimp and grits. They were both excellent! Great service and atmosphere as well!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you enjoy service without a smile, generic shopping mall atmosphere, and warm low-quality overpriced oysters served by a staff that doesn't know anything about oysters. 

I mean, there isn't even an actual oyster bar. 

The house oysters are an embarrassment to oysters and any reputable place would not even serve such tasteless and slimy imposters. 

My best advice is simply to not go here. No oysters at all is better than oysters from Pearlz."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything I've had on the menu has been great! Gumbo, jambalaya, raw oysters, oysters Rockefeller, shrimp & grits, mussels and whole Bronzino have all been fabulous!!! Charlotte finally has a great seafood restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"I search near and far, high and low for a restaurant that can make a clam chowder without the grit! Sadly, not here. And while we're at it, what's a 3 \" piece of industrial food plastic (you know, the type that surrounds pasteurized packaged lobster meat for the supposedly \"fresh\" lobster used in the lobster roll) doing in my lobster roll? I literally pulled it out of my mouth like some goofy 3 Stooges bit.  Disgusting. Totally weak response from the manager who took it off the bill but obviously didn't think it was a big thing.

I will never go back."}
{"text":"Best tuna poke I've ever had! The bartender and rest of staff are fantastic! They always have a good selection of wine and beer taps."}
{"text":"I was craving oysters and this place somewhat hit the spot for me. The other dishes were just underwhelming and the atmosphere sorta dull.

Sundays have a $3 mimosa, $5 Bloody Mary drink special. But, I didn't like my Bloody Mary.. It tasted like watered down tomato juice with cheap vodka. I got the house oysters steamed and they were pretty good. Shucking them myself for the first time ever was a bit difficult though. The calamari appetizer was good but salty. We had to ask for lemon wedges and extra sauce (it came drizzled on top of the calamari not on the side). The crab cakes were small but tasty. Our waitress was really nice and informative. My friend got the lobster roll. It was just ok. The lobster meat was tough and chewy to me. Maybe we came on the wrong night (a Sunday stormy night) but this place can have potential if they work on improving their drink specials and dishes. Overall, too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"We just finished an $82 meal here with poor service, loud music and so-so food. We are big fans of both Charleston locations and know what the food & service can be. This one needs a lot of work!  My husband's appetizer was served after the meal came and his piece of grouper was tiny.  Bonefish would have been a much better choice."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place, but they still have some kinks to work out.  Waited 40 minutes for a takeout order (they said it would take 20).  Also, they need to work on their front of house staff.  The girl who took my phone order knew nothing about the menu.  Also, in person she was dressed in a dowdy t shirt and kept playing with her dirty looking hair.  Not a good impression for people walking into the restaurant for the first time."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Gumbo was like rue with ol'bay. I guess if you have nothing to compare it to then it would be great, but we are seafood junkies.  We like to try new things, so we did."}
{"text":"I like there happy hour with unlimited oysters. I went twice and the oysters were fresh but service was a bit slow"}
{"text":"I love the oyster selection way better than that of other oyster bars in Charlotte. Their selection of entrees on the menu isn't huge but that it compensated by daily specials that will rival any other restaurant in terms of freshness and quality."}
{"text":"Mark the oyster shucker at the bar is bomb. Can't wait until he's old enough to run the whole bar. He's the reason we come back. :)"}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Pearlz Oyster and Raw Bar located in the StoneCrest at Piper Glen Shopping Center in Ballantyne, NC.

Dora here. What a massive, eclectic shopping center! Restaurants, boutiques, salon, spa...even a Target and Harris Teeter. I could happily lose myself in here for days. 

This restaurant offers fresh seafood in a casual dining environment with an outside patio. Now, if you follow our blog much, you know it is not too often that I can talk my wife into experiencing a seafood restaurant, but it was Father's Day, so what could she say.

Dora here. Anything for you, honey.

We ordered a side of Corn Fritters as an appetizer. Served with a dose of powdered sugar, these fritters were crusty (Dora here. I told him he couldn't use the word \"crispy\" again today, and this is what he comes up with, lol) on the outside and soft on the inside with nuggets of fresh corn and red pepper. The fritters were great but I missed a dipping sauce to be enjoyed while eating them.

Dora here. YUM! These babies were fluffy and light, with occasional glimmers of corn and red pepper flecks. The touch of sweet from the powdered sugar made us debate whether they tasted more savory than sweet. Great start to our meal! Don't they look delicious?

I chose the New England Lobster Roll with a side of homemade chips and a cup of seafood gumbo. Now I know you will say that is a lot of seafood, but when you do not get it too often, you have to load up on it when you get a chance. (Dora here. Haha.) The lobster roll was creamy, tender and tasty, and served on a grilled roll capable of handling this full-bodied sandwich. Outstanding!

The gumbo was packed with rice, sausage, beans, shrimp, and some other ingredients that I could not identify because I devoured it too fast. Hardy flavor and just the right amount of heat. Another thumbs up!

Dora here. Take a gander at the Crab Sandwich. Yowza! What's not to love about a buttery soft bun barely containing all that crabilicious flavor? The broccoli slaw wasn't mayo based, so I used it as another condiment for my sandwich, which added another texture and layer of flavors. Delicious! And I'm not a fan of tomatoes, but those super tiny maters on this sandwich were so fresh and sweet, I ate every one of them! Just don't tell my mother. lol

Has a restaurant prepared a particular item in such a way that you found yourself enjoying a food that you normally don't like?

We rate this restaurant 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"Great oysters and amazing steak. We had a great time with friends. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Saw this place tucked away in Stone Crest. Food was great and the service was top notch. Quinn the bartender provided spectacular service."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is amazing. The fish tacos is where it's at. Great service all around."}
{"text":"We were very excited to have a new oyster bar in the area my man got me to try raw oysters a few years ago and I've been hooked ever since. It was busy on a Friday night with a 20-30 minute wait but we found seats at the bar and were decided to eat there. 

We were greeted promptly and placed drink orders. Drinks were good but quite pricey. We started with raw oysters. We asked the waiters opinion about a certain type of oyster and he very obviously had no idea. He turned to the two guys shucking behind the bar who were both very knowledgable. I will give them it was not quite oyster season but to be honest none of their oysters blew me away. We had oysters at another restraint two weeks prior and their worst oyster was better than Pearlz best. The BLT seafood tower was ok but over priced for size and quality.

We ordered the special which was a crab stuffed trout with honey risotto and I will give them it was a delicious combination of flavors. Overall the atmosphere was nice. The entree was great but with the over priced drinks and food and lack luster oysters I do not think we will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner last night after a movie. Love the atmosphere. Mussels with butter and garlic with hot grilled toast are AMAZING. I can't wait to get that again. Fried shrimp appetizer, super light and lots of flavor. Our waiter Jonathan was so great. Kevin the manager came over to introduce himself. Can't wait to go back for a meal. Nice addition in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"This place is okay - they do oysters well as an appetizer.  The seafood gumbo was pretty good.  The beer was also decent.  Service was pretty good.  The shrimp and grits was, well... let's just say it was okay, but I've had much better.

Atmosphere - wide open area, darkish interior and very large booths.

While the place is nothing to rave about, it certainly isn't bad.  If I am traveling through here again, I would probably stop, but then again, there are several other places around the area I have not yet tried."}
{"text":"Update: Father's Day 6/17/18, and I did NOT contact management before we went, as was suggested due to our previous visit in 2017.  
Our party consisted of our son, his wife, my husband and myself. This time, everything was fantastic and delicious - worthy of a full 5-Star review.  Their $3.00 mimosas are quite refreshing and the Oyster shots were pretty dang good. To start, we shared 2 orders of oysters on the half shell. Dinner items consisted of: Pearlz signature burger; Angus Beef NY Strip; crab legs; quinoa Tabouli salad. Everything was delicious, and service was great. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is an unholy union between Fatz & Hooters!

Food was so-so, service was deplorable. Tea was served with no lemons, bench seat comes up for storage, or at least it did for the hefty fellow that sat next to us! I guess people in Charlotte are willing to pay big bucks for seafood! Menu was pretty skimpy and weak. Can't really recommend this place. If you're angry, look like Sam Kinison, like crapohydrates, you'll fit in great here!"}
{"text":"Just okay.   This is another place everyone seems to rave about, but honestly service and food were par if not below.  

Ordered a tuna and a mahi fish taco both of which were somewhat flavorless.  

Service was just ok as well but especially disappointing as it wasn't crowded at the time."}
{"text":"Oysters are so fresh here! 2x doesn't of raw oysters, 2x appetizers, 4x entrees, 5x beers for $200. Great deal!"}
{"text":"Do not recommend...This was a friendly place, nice menu, server was outstanding, HOWEVER, I ordered tacos and on the first bite, I had a plastic bread tie in my mouth. Manager apologized and said \" I won't make you pay\". She took the plate and didn't come back. The server came back twice while we were leaving, to apologize and express his embarrassment.....seems like their responsibilities should be reversed.

Initially, this had the appearance of a safe place to dine but my experience represents a blatent disregard for food handling and preparation."}
{"text":"I hear people talk about this place alot. I've attempted to eat here three times.

We order shrimp cocktail and its mushy and not crisp  or cold. It goes back 3 times before we can eat it.

Next some sort of pasta dish. Honestly after the shrimp I was scared to death to try anymore fish. Out comes a pasta dish covered in onions! Does not mention onions on the menu. And its loaded with butter. All and all horrible experience. 

I am only leaving two stars simply because the manager did the right thing and took the entire bill off. And we left a decent tip. I can't say I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great specials, great food, the best service and delicious drinks - love the bartenders. We have always had impeccable service and never had to wait too long. My favorite is the cod sliders and my husband always love the oysters. The clam chowder is yum too!"}
{"text":"Very consistent since our first visit in regards to the adult choices and flavor. I must say they have improved from the grand opening month in regards to having a liquor license in place. We first visited during the opening month and they were waiting on licensing to serve liquor. So think about Blakney/Ballantyne on a weekend if you know anything about these area they are pretty lively all week and especially on the weekend with families, singles, couples, etc.. going out for dinner and in many cases having a drink to accompany their meal. 

We were almost put off because this place was empty which was weird due to the crowd in the area. Immediately when the hostess greeted us she mentioned that there is no alcohol as they haven't received their license and she seemed so sad in saying so. We ensures her that we didn't need a drink to try the food we can walk over to another place afterwards if we needed liquor afterwards. We were seated in the first booth near the door. Our server was nice and we enjoyed our dishes. I had a seafood salad tower with fresh shrimp and crab and asparagus and more (I don't eat pork so minus the bacon for me). My husband and teenager had the fried shrimp platters. Since then we've returned about 3 or more times and all of which the liquor license was in place which makes for a wait for a table. The wait isn't too bad and if just with another adult you can grab a seat at the bar and dine there which is what my hubby and I did on our night out alone a couple weeks ago.
Our fav items include:
Mussels
Cod sliders 
Fried Oysters 
Fried Shrimp platter 
Seafood pasta with the garlic sauce from the mussels *Next time I'll be sure to ask for more shrimp and tell them to leave off the clams as they were OK but the mussels and shrimp WERE the powerful items in the dish with the most flavor.

I give them 4 stars because I haven't had a bad moment there. I would give some suggestions as far as the kids menu. The grill cheese is what we go for each time but the bread is extremely too flaky they need a softer bread as it is HARD as a rock once sitting for like 10mins. Kids eat slow so that's no good. Also they need to have a Fresh fruit side option as our son doesn't prefer fries he like fruit. A plus is the kitchen cut up an orange for our son because we didn't want the fries for him. That isn't an option but they did it anyway."}
{"text":"Fried Oysters, Bar Service, and Beers were all excellent!  
The Tuna Tartare (Poke) was unfortunately gooey and gloopy with a dressing that unfortunately destroyed the dish.  Served with toasted baguette slices that were chewy...not crunchy.  They seemed like we were served yesterday's toast.  Would be better served with chips... but sadly, I wasn't that impressed when it came to a dish that is best served simply....fresh tuna, a dash of sesame oil, and a sprinkle of soy.  Simpler is better when it comes to tartare/poke.  
I'd definitely do the fried oysters again, however!  My husband enjoyed his crab cake sandwich for the most part.  A-OK."}
{"text":"First time here - working from out of town - glad I came in! Sat at the bar with my iPad. Quint(sp?) the bartender came right over with water and asked if I needed a menu which I did. I then asked about a special vs a standard and was told that if I plan on coming back, which I do, to take the special which this day was fried belly clams with fries. So good!!! Complemented it with a glass of pinot grigio, a bartender who didn't rush me out and a very friendly environment. I got a kick out of seeing so many people ordering the oysters and shucking them themselves! I would be too afraid but they were having so much fun. Great place, great food, great atmosphere. Thank you!"}
{"text":"2nd time here.  Love oysters and seafood.  Great atmosphere and location.  Lots of locals visit here.  Try it when in Charlotte"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a delicious dinner last night at Pearlz! We had oyster and crab legs and they were awesome! definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing service as always!! Can't wait to try the new oyster selection and house made shrimp and veggie wontons"}
{"text":"Prices are great for fresh seafood.  

I'm from New England so I wanted good Clam Chowder. The chowder had plenty of clams, it had a good consistence but it had a spice that gave it a stronger bitter taste - maybe too much thyme not sure wasn't bad but not the best I had had. 

Fried oyster where excellent, not over breaded and not over fried. 

Lobster roll was loaded with just Lobster and on a toasted New England roll.  

My wife had the BLT Seafood stack and she enjoyed it very much - loaded with seafood and great presentation. 

My son had the Muscles on pasta - that was the winner great balance with oil and garlic, muscles where hot and fresh not over cooked on ribbons of thin pasta."}
{"text":"Skimpy lobster Roll.  Small Bun and not enough meat for price.  Food good.  Only one Tv at bar."}
{"text":"Dinner here was the best one I had in Carolina. The waitress offered us a extra table to put along side the one we were at to give us more space for the food we were ordering. Shortly after, another customer came and they took the table. The gentleman who took the table brought us a platter of oysters and said sorry for the inconvenience. This was such a nice gesture especially coming after our server offered us a bowl of clam chowder for the same reason. The food was delicious. Everything was brought out hot, looked, and smelled amazing. The oysters were fresh and the clam chowder was hearty. I would recommend this restaurant to any friends or family in California."}
{"text":"The wife and I were a little skeptical after our experience at Pearlz in Charleston a while back, but we are all for second chances. Now the first thing may be to say that all Pearlz locations may not be equally comparable. It may be more like comparing apples to oranges really. The Charlotte location is in a shopping center, while the Charleston location is in the bustling touristy historic area. The only comparable thing really other than similar menus was the time of day that we ate there. We were there during late lunch time on all occasions. The Charlotte location was not busy at all, while the Charleston version was slammed with people there for happy hour oysters and drinks. It would be interesting to see how the Charlotte locations deals when they are slammed, likely on Friday and Saturday night. Anyway, enough about the comparison, let's talk about the food and service in Charlotte. Both times we sat at the bar to watch the shucking action going on. The oysters were good, fresh and reasonably priced. The wife and I appreciate a variety and love the saltier/briny ones that typically come from the colder waters of northern New England and Atlantic Canada. 

On the 2 lunch visits, we also ordered apps and/or sandwiches to include lobster roll, cod sliders, crab cake sandwich and the crab cake appetizer. All of the seafood was fresh and perfectly cooked. Oh and no filler in the huge all crab meat in the crab cake, which is always nice to see. I am particular about my lobster and lobster roll, so I was happy to hear that it was made with fresh cooked lobster. The lobster was the star of the show and also overtook and covered the whole simple hot dog bun that it was served on, again which was a good thing. It was just a little messy to eat as a sandwich and definitely requiring two hands to secure everything together. The Charleston rice was recommended as a side item to go with my lobster roll and really there is no need to opt for any other side in my book. It's like a spicy jambalaya and very filling. I ordered it again with my cod sliders at the next visit.

Service at the bar was great and attentive. Having personable people behind the bar shucking oysters, making drinks and serving food goes a long way. The only drawback is that we are not close by to be regulars, but we will return as often as when can and whenever we are in the area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. Try the fish platter - 4 different filets that change regularly. Staff is friendly, drinks are stronger than avg, and service has improved greatly in past 6 months."}
{"text":"We gave this a second shot. The food again was solid although the shrimp was over seasoned but they did good on making it right. But service was slow again.  Too many other places in stonecrest to put up with this. Didn't seem to care about last review either. Keep it up :P not coming back out of principle not that they would care"}
{"text":"One word to describe my experience..AMAZING!! We were a large group of 12 and the food and service was exceptional. We all shared and tasted one anothers food (Oysters Rockefeller, crab dip, seafood gumbo), I took advantage of restaurant weeks menu and got the spare ribs, they were mouth watering. Best mashed potatoes I've ever had. Since some of us arrived at different times, we did not all order at once and our waitress handled the confusion gracefully. My husband and I are already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. They do have a decent happy hour and it is designed to let you try a few things off the menu. The craft beer special was a bit limited since they only have 4 or 5 beers on draft. The Oysters Rockefeller was very tasty. 

Our waiter was incredibly nice and even showed my dad how to open his steamed oysters."}
{"text":"Pearlz is an AWESOME place! 
Really cool to meet with a group of friends there, a family dinner, or to entertain clients.
Extremely delicious with a variety of seafood entrees or amazing sandwiches if you prefer.
The roasted garlic potatoes are better than any I've ever tried.
The location - in the middle of one of Charlotte's finest shopping centers - is perfect!
Probably the most professional restaurant staff in the city!"}
{"text":"Great seafood.  Best oysters, shrimp tacos, and wahoo.  Fish was seared perfect.  Fresh sauces prepared daily including the buffalo sauce.  My new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Their shrimp and gritz are great, they gave us saltine crackerz as a FREE appetizer, and the waitress was nice. They do a daily special type thing on the shrimp and gritz where they do a different style each day. The style today was sausage and peppers with blackened shrimpz. Our waitress said \"Merry Christmas\" instead of \"Happy Holidayz\" when we were leaving which I was very fond of.

Their ceazar salad with grilled shrimp was good, however I thought the grilled shrimp was over cooked and slightly bland.

Their crab cakez were small in size but gigantic in flavor and the garnish (slaw) was delicious as well.

A great place to eat before you watch the Hornetz or the Pantherz!"}
{"text":"Really can't say anything nice about this place. We went for the 1st time. Sat at the bar. We finally get acknowledged by the bartender (it was a Monday, so not busy) and we say we want to order quick, as we were going to a movie in a bit. We order. We wait 5 minutes for a simple glass of water. Not really sure what he was doing - um nothing. We thought about ordering cocktails, but since he could care less about our needs, we decided against it. Shrimp taco - 4 rubbery shrimp. Rubbery. He never returns, never asks if things are fine, do we need anything else, etc. We were looking the menu over - is he a mind reader thinking I won't ask if they want anything else, they don't - are we not dressed properly (we were) - are we not a regular that he expects a fat tip from? We could turn into one - we won't now. My husband had to flag him down to just get our tab for 4 rubbery shrimp and the oyster shooter. Good thing it wasn't my birthday. Wait, it was. We found somewhere that thought our  patronage and money was worth something. This place is WAY overrated. Glad that bartender didn't have to work very hard. Hubby still left a nice tip. Can you give it to someone else? Perhaps the new guy that asked for help from the lazy bartender and he just walks away and does nothing."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! So love having Pearlz here in my home town Yum!!!  Blue Points are delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Pearlz in Charlotte is a wonderful place. A narrow selection of great beer and a grand offering of oysters and other amazing culinary offerings.
I started with a great Tuna Poke and Yuengling beer, then an amazing Shrimp N Grits with a Charlotte brewery Triple C Smoked Amber.
Maybe I was influenced by the flawless service, but this place was amazing!
I feel it starts with the staff and I have to say the staff at Pearlz is on point at all times. They were either checking on customers, wiping down the bar or taking food to customers. Their attitudes reflected a great place to work, that says allot.
I'll be back, no doubt!"}
{"text":"firstly the service was really really good.  surprisingly enough the oysters were very skimpy and lacked flavor. we spent $27 and tried three different kinds. Not impressed as I was expecting to be.  My friend said her gnocchi was good. My burger was overdone. The crab dip tasted odd like they may have added vermouth  or similar. It was not for me. Friend said mussels were good. Parking was good, the beer selection was ok and the restaurant itself was very pretty. It was pretty loud. Not sure we are going back."}
{"text":"It was our first time there on Friday night September 17, 2015. I heard Pearlz had just opened two weeks earlier. I'm not sure yet if I would return. It seemed like a huge bar but not as many tables or booths. There were many menus and lots going on on the menus making it hard to make a decision when the server popped up asking if we had decided yet. There was a wrinkled paper special menu for the night that had small plates and half plates and sharing plates and tasty treats and everything from soup to nuts. Then there was a laminated permanent menu that had many more decisions. I had the lobster roll but it wasn't lobster salad it was loaded with lobster meat which I think was fake lobster or else it would've cost $1 million. The lobster substitute and roll were delicious in my previous reviewand the homemade chips that I expected to be thick spicy salty and like many with that burned taste turned out to be delicious thin chips. We asked if there was a dessert menu but it seems there is only one special desert each night and if it's something you don't like you're sunk. The drinks all worked out great and it is hard for any restaurant to mess up drinks. It was a 45 minute wait on Friday which wasn't bad but Stonecrest has so much going on including concerts and restaurants that it's like a high level circus. The restaurant seems like it specializes in attracting 18 to 35-year-olds but there were quite a few older people there with adult children and grandchildren.

In my previous review I said \"I think\" the lobster was fake and did not use misinformation or know for sure. So any comments directed at the review are also using misinformation. Get it right next time reviewers."}
{"text":"After the second time I went to Pearlz I vowed not to go back - however, after deciding we wanted to listen to the outdoor music at Stonecrest on a gorgeous night with a decent band - we relented. It was noticeable that many tables were vacant inside and out - still in the peak dinner hour. Typically on a Friday night, back when Miro was in this spot, you could wait an hour+ for a table, particularly outdoors. We walked in and stood by the vacant hostess station - honestly, they were only half full - it was not a great first impression - yet again. We finally got seated on the patio and the waitress stood chatting with a gal at the table next to us (she appeared to be an employee who was off her shift, having dinner) for an uncomfortably long time - never acknowledging us. Then after this banter, she started walking away and I had to speak up to get her attention as we wanted to order a bottle of wine. I ordered the mussels - thinking it would be hard to mess this up - they came out COLD - so disappointing. My husband had a stacked seafood salad that was dry and looked very unappetizing. Sorry - love the location - do not like the food or the service or the atmosphere - this time I'm really not going back."}
{"text":"I was only here on one occasion but it was quite tasty.  The fish was very tasty and the service was both friendly and professional.  I would have no trouble at all recommending this to any seafood lover.  I have not found there to be a ton of excellent seafood choices around here so I was happy to find this place.  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the creative dishes and fresh oysters and shrimp. Staff was great  and  relaxing."}
{"text":"First time eating at this Pearlz, we had to wait for a good minute but it was not an awful wait. It was very well worth the wait! I had the southern fried OYSTERS.... crazy Delicious, my wife had the largest bowl gumbo that I have ever seen, a dozen of oysters on the half, my friend started out with a cup of clam chowder, a dozen of oysters, calamari all fo appetizer, the oysters platter dinner... the Food was the best ever! I every thing melted I your mouth busting with flavor, every thing that we ate was full of flavor. My one and only problem was the server, her name was Shannon, I asked her specially how many oysters were on the appetizer portions, she told me, I asked her what was the top shelf bourbon she passed me her cheat sheet to read. My question all had their meals except fo me. When it show up it was all Shrimp. When Shannon. Finally made a wellness check I told her that I was bought out shrimp and not oysters she told me that I asked her for the shrimp count and that what I order. I said but no I did not.. Shannon smiled and walked away... she came back
With our
$132.00 tab..
If you  have her Shannon I hope your experience will go better than  ours.. The Good is a simply delicious and the music was great too just not Shannon..."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is outstanding... The seafood and peel and eat shrimp is delicious. The Maui tacos are amazing.. excellent atmosphere to relax and have a good time..."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and location of this place. We went to Ballantine location. Easy to get there. We had the crab dip appetizer. It was pretty good. My husband had three tacos: oyster, shrimp and mahi. He said the oyster one was the best. I had salmon tacos. very good but the banana peppers had a funny taste. I also had a wedge salad. It was great but it didn't have onions. Sad about that. I should have asked for some. Overall the meal was great and we will go back. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Our party of six had a fun night at Pearlz. Got there around 6pm. It was their busiest time. We were seated with a short wait of 15 minutes. Our waitress was young but she did a great job. Took our orders and food came out quickly. Great night with great food."}
{"text":"Excellent establishment. Server was attentive and generally cared that we left with all inquiries answered and fully satisfied. Separate from her I noticed the manager, a French Canadian he called himself, on duty today that made a point to greet \"most tables\". I say his characteristics deliberately as I hope he becomes aware of my comments. I saw him specifically introduce himself and ask how things were going to a majority of patrons over 40 years of age. On a Monday lunch period it was obvious what he was doing. I hope his kitchen and server staff are commended for their good work and the manager made aware of his biases. Ballantyne or not you owe a service of gratitude to every patron in your establishment. NEVER expect you are above your patrons."}
{"text":"First time so we did our usual, try it for lunch first. This is part of the HOMETOWN HOSPITALITY GROUP out of Charleston. I had the Soup (Tomato/Blue Crab) and Slider (Crab Cake). The Soup was very good with a decent amount of Blue Crab.... and very hot! The Crab Cake had very little filler and a Mustard Cream Sauce, Tomato and Arugala. My wife had the same except New England Clam Chowder.  Thanks Chowder was overloaded with Clams, potatoes..... but was very bland with very little flavor at all. I took the Chowder but had to add Salt and Pepper. I'm sure we'll be back but as far as the Chowder goes, I'll ask for a sample first!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy that Pearlz has come to Charlotte. Have dined at both Charleston locations. My wife and I love this place. I actually tried something different this time. The lump crab cake sandwich. It was amazing. We always start with the Calamari, then the Pearlz house salad. The wife went with the shrimp dinner. Service went way beyond what I expected after only 3 weeks from their opening. Iva was our waitress and she did a wonderful job."}
{"text":"The food was good. The fried oysters & the  raw on half shell was tasty. The waitress was very rude, uneducated regarding the menu. She had an attitude that almost got her cussed out & fired! 
Training needed on customer service. Unfortunately first impressions can dictate if a person will return. The waitress lost customers b/c of her unprofessionalism."}
{"text":"Love this spot! We came on a Saturday night with no reservation and while the wait was estimated at 40-45 mins, we found seating at the bar in less than 20. Pleasantly surprised.

The service was fantastic. Travis (the manager) and Noah behind the bar were so great and entertaining and provided a wealth of information about oysters. Speaking of oysters, the Beau Soleil oysters here are a MUST. Seriously. Get them. Even someone like me who is not particularly fond of oysters loved them. 

As for our entrees, I ordered the grilled mahi mahi and my boyfriend the seared yellow tail -both incredibly fresh and flavorful. My boyfriend's meal came with a side of pickled red cabbage slaw which he raved about. Cocktails were also perfect.

Overall, one of the best seafood meals we have enjoyed. Highly recommend this spot. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"How cute!!! A little east of Charleston in Charlotte. This really is a perfect location. The atmosphere is wonderful. This is a hidden gem. Can't believe I'm
just trying this place out but it's a must to go again. 


Update update update!!!! Went again and again. Everyone please get the Seafood Gumbo. You'll wanna slap your Spouse...I promise. Oh and the Fried Oysters. And if you remember from my bio I absolutely hate Oysters but I need to change that to raw oysters. The fried ones are DELICIOUS. Taste like chicken. Lol"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!! The food was phenomenal and the service was great. I wanted to try everything on the menu. But I'll be back soon.  I went with these two wonderful people. And we had a great time."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  Lobster roll is genuine bread and full of meat.  Just no scallions next time .  Lobster needs nothing but butter. ;) recommend !"}
{"text":"Update: went here for a midweek date and was impressed. Menu has been updated - the poke is really good, the gluten free menu has wonderful options and I enjoyed the shrimp and grits thoroughly. 

Recently grabbed dinner here with the family
Pros: solid service, good happy hour options and comprehensive seafood menu (even if you don't enjoy oysters)
Cons: expensive considering portion sizes, food lacks dynamic flavor profiles.

Everyone really liked the fried oysters, scallops and lobster risotto, and mahi mahi taco. Tuna taco was fatty and had the bloodline still attached and the calamari lacked bright flavors. 

Overall a good option if you are seeking seafood in Ballantyne but not destination dining ."}
{"text":"Love this Oyster Bar .. I will be a regular - my new favorite place. Staff is friendly and service is excellent. All the oysters and seafood is very fresh. You have to try it soon."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! Been there 3 times and every time it has exceeded expectations! If you like Mussels, Clams, Oysters then get here at some point! Cool atmosphere and friendly staff. Overall just a fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"There are so many other choices available around the area.  We kept being told they were closing and we needed to order and get out.  This was mildly entertaining since they were still seating people after us.  The piece of cake we ordered for dessert was $9.00 and was remarkably small.  I would say find a more accommodating restaurant that is a better value."}
{"text":"Not a lot of tables but when you get one its well worth it!  Fried oyster app with buffalo sauce is outstanding.  Dean and DeLuca is right behind it so a good spot to relax while waiting on a table."}
{"text":"For a taste of New England down south, this is the restaurant to go to. To be honest, if you're a northerner and you know what Legal Seafood is, then let me tell you right now that Pearlz's clam chowder blows Legal's out of the water...clearly, if you like New England food, you've got to make a stop here. The executive chef is from Massachusetts so that right there proves the food is authentic. Made with the classic New England ingredients like potatoes, huge clams, and lots of cream (sometimes restaurants skimp out on the amount of clams but this soup is everything but lacking in clams). The cup of it comes in a pretty big sized bowl, so you get a really good amount for the price. Their lobster roll is also to die for!! With a nicely toasted bun and huge chunks of lobster meat!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Charlotte desperately needed a stand up seafood restaurant. This place had such a good atmosphere and I was really impressed with the staff. We sat at the oyster bar and got to see the guys shucking the oysters all night. In my opinion the oyster bar is the best seat in the house. The crab cake appetizer was my favorite, with lumps of crab and a yummy mustard sauce. We also had a half dozen of the house oysters along with a cup of the clam chowder and some peel and eat shrimp. I would order all of the above again and thought it was all great! Give them a try!"}
{"text":"It was date night and my wife and I wanted to try something different, so we went with seafood. We picked this place because we've been to the one in Charleston. 

The long and short is this: it's seafood, 300 miles inland from the nearest beach. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't amazing. It's a far cry from the Charleston location - to be expected as Chucktown is right on the coast. 

The food was nothing to write home about, the service was tolerable at best, and my wife's martini was missing an ingredient they had listed on the drink menu - because they ran out. It also came in a glass that had a huge chip on the rim of it. 

TLDR: don't waste your time here, nothing that impressive."}
{"text":"Great selection of raw oysters! Fun to sit at the bar and try various oysters from around the US."}
{"text":"I have been following Pearlz eversince I discovered the restaurants in Charleston, SC. I always order the Oysters Rockefeller, (to die for!) Shrimp and Crab Seafood Tower Salad! It's pretty consistent. It tastes better when you dine in. I've had their Lobster Roll, which was very good, And their Lobster/Seafood Tower on ice. (can't remember exact name) Their sliders were good too. Also, my husband and I enjoy experiencing the selection of raw oysters. I guess you can say I'm a \"regular\", so trust my judgement.  You've got eat here! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great if you look rich & white!

I'll start by saying I've been here several times with my friends and have always had a great experience. 

Last night, I was surprised to observe such a sudden change. We took my grandmother and my aunt out for a nice dinner. They love oysters, came all the way from GA to visit us, and it was my Grammie's 68th birthday! I was excited to take them here, and I told them they would LOVE it.

I was completely embarrassed by the way we were treated. 

Admittedly, I did not dress well this time out. I was in a tshirt, jacket, yoga pants and tennis shoes. Looking back, I probably should have dressed nicer. But I didn't think it would matter THAT much. This place isn't that upscale... I mean people wear jeans there! 

Anyway, the rest of my party was wearing nicer jackets/tops with jeans. So I was really the only one who could be considered underdressed. 

I think this set the tone off quite horribly. When I told them we needed a table for 4, we were told there would be a 30 minute wait. I said ok! No problem, it's a Saturday night and they're probably busy.

Then, we noticed several open tables throughout our 30 minutes. Couples that walked in, admittedly dressed nicer than me, were given these tables before us. I thought maybe they had made reservations, so I wasn't too concerned at first. However, I wasn't so understanding after the 5th group that walked in (no one else was waiting inside the restaurant) got sat before us. Was this really a punishment for me not dressing nice?

After 30 mins, we FINALLY got seated..... and you know what? The table they sat us at was OPEN THE ENTIRE TIME WE WERE WAITING!!!!! I was very upset by this point. This table was in the back left corner of the restaurant, and we enjoyed a lovely view of the server stand as well as the kitchen/back of the bar. We were also lucky enough to be seated right next to the bathrooms!

I still cannot believe they had us wait 30 minutes even though there was a table open for us the entire time.... and they also weren't shy about seating more \"desirable\" customers before us.

As a former server, I'm pretty sure I know what happened here. You saw me not nicely dressed, and maybe you even saw my family members' dark skin. You immediately dismissed us as \"undesirable\" customers because of the way we looked. 

My & my boyfriend's check was over $100 alone. We frequently dine at similarly priced restaurants, and I guess I expected too much out of this one.

At least they were nice enough to give my grandma a free bday cake!"}
{"text":"Pearlz Oyster Bar is a seafood / cocktail bar located in Charlotte, NC.  According to their website, they are \"The Eclectic Little Oyster Bar\" with several locations (including Columbia, SC; West Ashley, SC, Charleston, SC).  

They have Happy Hour specials!!  We were able to order the dozen oysters for $12.  Woot Woot!!

For entree, I ordered the Shrimp and Grits based on the recommendation of our waitress.  One of my colleagues ordered the Pearlz Signature Burger, so we ended up splitting our entrees.  My motto is always \"variety is the spice of life\" or \"sharing is caring\"!!  For dessert, I ordered the chocolate cake.  NOM NOM NOM!!

MUST GET item is Shrimp and Grits!!  You won't regret it!!  ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"First time and we enjoyed it.  I just had the grilled veggies or seasonal veggies and they were hot and very tasty;  definitely cooked with butter.   Son ordered  fish tacos and every time he took a bite it was with a mmm.  He thought the fritters were great.   Other son had fried oyster appetizer and loved it ; said tasted fresh.  Wife had seafood blt and at first she returned it because they forgot the crab, but they apologized and she said it was very good. Great first experience. ..we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Visited a second time. Service very good. I again ordered the crab tomato bisque which was yummy. My friends ordered the fresh oysters and thought they were  very good. Presentation of food excellent. Hubby ordered a medley of grilled fish with deep fried mashed potatoes. I ordered hot tea  but they  we're out of tea bags but charged me for a cup of hot water."}
{"text":"The hubby and I took a chance on getting in on a Friday during Queens Feast without a reservation.  We had a 30 minute wait which wasn't bad all things considered.  We were seated at a community table, which was interesting.  Our server, Marley was terrific; very well versed on the menu offerings.  Hubby started with a dozen house oysters, which he said were really fresh.  I had a cup of the new england clam chowder.  Delicious, velvety chock full of clams.  I had to stop myself from eating it all because it was so filling.  next up we had the crab cakes.  Can I just say, no filler!  The aioli was has just the right amount of tang to finish these puppies.  Hubby has the gumbo, which he found lacking in seafood, but he enjoyed it none the less.  We had a side of gratin potatoes and grilled asparagus.  The asparagus was meh, could have use a little char on it.  The potatoes were great.  I also had the lobster roll, which I found a little disappointing. The sandwich had no dressing or sauce at all. I was expecting a lobster salad sort of deal, but it was just, well, lobster. Overall, our meal was enjoyable, the service terrific.  We will definitely return, if only for the oysters and crab cakes."}
{"text":"First time to this place with my sister and my cousin. We went on a Sunday evening arriving at 7 and the place was quiet with only two tables and three people at the bar. We were greeted right away by a friendly host. The place was clean and looked new. I have been to the original location in Charleston,SC and this location is so much bigger! 

The food at the Charleston location was phenomenal and that is why I when I found out that we have one in Charlotte I made up my mind that I had to go. What a disappointment. We ordered broiled shrimp, steamed clam, clam chowder and lobster rolled that was served with chips. I have to tell you that the seafood was not fresh. The chowder was good and came out in a huge bowl that we shared and got like 4 cups out of it. The clam was tiny and dry. The shrimp was ok, lacks flavor. The lobster roll was tasteless with no seasonings or flavor. Plus, the chips it was served with was over fried and a little stale. 

I would not come here again because the food just wasn't fresh and didn't leave an impression. It's not cheap either. For the three of us the bill was about $60 for 3 appetizers and one lobster roll with chips."}
{"text":"I guess it's time to write an updated review of Pearlz since we've been going for 2 years now, I can't believe it's been that long already! We mainly stick to the tried & trues - Oysters Rockefeller, steamed mussels, peel and eat jumbo shrimp, gumbo, clam chowder, lobster rolls. Everything I've tried there was delicious and I think it's a great value for what you get. 

Even if they're packed, you can usually squeeze in at the bar in a short amount of time. We get great service sitting there, plus you get a free oyster shucking show. 

Speaking of service, I'm always impressed how willing they are to customize your order. Want your lobster roll hot with butter (do this, by the way) instead of cold lobster salad - no prob. Want those fish tacos blackened or grilled instead of fried - just ask. A lot of restaurants are really unaccommodating with special requests, so I appreciate that. 

I would love to see them open a location Uptown to get that city vibe. Stonecrest is just so...well, you know. In the meantime, I'll just be glad I don't have to drive all the way to Charleston. 

I am currently craving their gumbo, the best I've had in Charlotte - so I see a trip there in my near future!"}
{"text":"Ok folks here we go again... this was my second time dining here and my second time being disappointed. The waitress was clueless about the daily specials as was the manager. The meal was half assed at best. One of the specials we ordered was nothing like the way it was described. What was supposed to be spicy was sweet, and the Brussel sprouts were so under cooked that you could break glass with them. The fish was dry and over cooked. The oysters, and oyster Rock were good as was the gumbo, but the rest was below par. Here's the kicker..... only 1 dessert choice!!! So if you don't like cheesecake then your screwed. Way over priced for quality of the food!!!!! Sorry Pearlz but 2 strikes and your out!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks and apps and this place is amazing. The calamari with extra aioli is a must try. We also got the shrimp egg rolls  a must cop. Sarah was a bartender and she was incredible. Great service and a personality that goes for miles. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"The seafood at Pearlz is exceptionally fresh and perfectly prepared. Our server, James was knowledgeable in every aspect of the menu, attentive, yet not intrusive. Manager Kevin, made certain our dining experience was exceptional. I would highly recommend that you ask for James! The ambiance is great, as well."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday. Paid $30 for 3 things to go: fish, potatoes, and grilled asparagus. Not too complicated. Got home with my wine and discovered I was only given 2 of the 3 things.  Was missing the vegetables. See pic. Sooooo weird. This, after speaking with the staff on the phone for 11 minutes (I had a few questions about their rather small menu that the young girl didn't know and each time had to go ask about. Like 'do you have green beans'.)  Note this place was not even busy for a Saturday night.  Called back and they said they will be mailing me back my $30. I did not care for the manner of the GM. I got the impression he did not have warm fuzzies for me either."}
{"text":"This is one of those reviews that needs a caveat. I'm not a big fan of \"fu-fu\" food. Our oysters were fresh, cold, delicious & affordable. They were served with all the necessary accoutrements, end of story. The tuna tartar tasted a bit off, fishy and I'm a huge sashimi fan. Their Cobb tower needs dressing options & if that's not acceptable, more rather than less is necessary due to the dryness of the ingredients in the tower. The homemade chips are served with a blue cheese knock-off, OK but two chunks amidst the liquid made us work around them to get any dip at all.  
All in all, not a good first visit. I think it's gonna take another trip to identify what they do well, did I mention the oysters...
P.S. Please stock a decent non-alcohol import, O'Doul's is disgusting!"}
{"text":"I love seafood;  it's probably my favorite type of food.  There is nothing better to me than sitting along a coast or body of water, on a patio, enjoying fresh, steamed seafood.  With that said, I'm giving Pearlz 3.5 stars and rounding up to 4 for its: nice ambience (4 stars); friendly,  courteous service (4 stars), quality seafood (4 stars); and consistency (3.5 stars). 

Nice ambience.  Pearlz is a little off the beaten path in a strip mall about 11 miles from Uptown (distance matters:  see below).  The area is relatively new and on the weekends, it's definitely bustling,  where the parking lot is full and there is a live band playing for your entertainment off the patio.  Inside, it's set up like a bar:  booth or high top seating comprised of dark wood in a dimly lit backdrop.  During the day, its large windows stream light in and at night, you have lighted trees right outside to enhance the playful atmosphere. 

Friendly, courteous service.  I've been to Pearlz several times now for both lunch and dinner,  usually on the weekends.  My most recent visit was on a Thursday night at around 9 pm, my only weekday visit.  On my weekend visits, they're generally relatively busy (the longest that I've waited for a table was 5 minutes) but they are always upbeat, attentive and prompt.  I order a very specific virgin margarita and like to have a new salted rim cup brought; further,  I make revisions to the menu that they very kindly accommodate.   However, the one weekday night I went, we were 2 of 3 patrons in the restaurant and the service was very slow, which was a break from the very expedient service to which I had grown accustomed.

Quality seafood.  The seafood I've had here is always fresh (as fresh as you can get being 3 hours from the coast) and the food is always flavorful.   I've had: 
--------DELICIOUS (I always order these): 
+  oysters.   The oysters aren't briny or fishy;  they melt in your mouth like butter.  They're not the best I've had but are good for the price.
+  steamed clams.  For some reason,  I can't do the raw ones even though I always do raw oysters.  I get them in the garlic butter sauce, which has light onions and freshly toasted,  lightly butter garlic bread and it is so yummy.  
+  peel and eat shrimp.  The shrimp is plump and succulent.  You have to do a little work but these guys are almost the size of prawns so they're worth it.  They are also well seasoned in Old Bay. 
+  clam chowder.  It's very hearty, full of chunks of potatoes and clams. The broth is creamy. Not the best I've had but still very good.  
+  fried shrimp dinner.  My boyfriend loves this, the fries are good, the shrimp are well seasoned and plump.  My boyfriend always orders this.
--------GOOD (sometimes but not always):
+  Caesar salad.  The dressing is lemon-based and creamy, a step up from store-bought but not quite as good as the house-made versions at steak restaurants.  
---------MEH, JUST OK (tried it but won't order again):
+  calamari.  They are breaded and fried, have good flavor of Old Bay and a hint of butter but not memorable.  
+  Lobster sandwich.  The lobster is tasty, the roll is buttery.  This is a good sandwich but not the best I've had. 
+  crab cake sandwich.  This is a crab cake dressed like a burger.  The crab cake is tender and sweet but not worthy of a repeat.  

On their raw menu, they have a 4 clams,  4 oysters and 4 shrimps item and I always revise this based on whether I order a full shrimp or full oyster (I typically end up with 6 clams and half a dozen of one other item).

Consistency.  I would have given Pearlz 4.5 stars but they got knocked down for consistency.  My last Thursday night visit had dissapointing service.  Our server would disappear for prolonged periods of time even though we were her only patrons.  

So I eat raw oysters all over the world without hesitation.  Usually, I'm willing to risk the upset tummy here and there because I do love oysters.  All the other 5+ times I've been,  I have never had a problem -- until last Thursday.  The 11-mile drive back home was sheer torture...  I'm certain it was the oysters or clams because my boyfriend was fine and didn't have either.  I'm not saying that it was enough to deter me from returning but I would say skip this as a first date location or at least skip the oysters or clams for such an occasion. 

Overall, I've been to Pearlz many times and would not hesitate to come back (but I'm willing to take calculated digestive risks), although consider yourself warned as far as consuming raw oysters or the steamed clams here (my adverse reaction was the exception not the norm but I've been to many other places throughout the world and only have problems 5% of the time, if ever)."}
{"text":"Update: Consistency is clearly the challenge here. This time the oysters were much better but the crab cakes were only ok; a lot more bread filling this time. Service was still great though."}
{"text":"The staff here is very sweet and attentive. The house oysters were great but the oyster shooter was not. The food here didn't really stand out to me it was just okay."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the pleasure of trying Pearlz for the first time this evening, and we were not disappointed. The place is really neat looking, there's a lovely mix of menu choices and the wines and craft beers were very nominally priced. Our server Sarah knew her job well and moved quickly (she's also lots of fun!). We were also welcomed by General Manager, Chad Rogers who spent more time chatting with us (interested in our ideas and asking what we thought of some of his). My husband devoured his fish and chips (they make their own chips) and I enjoyed my lighter dish, a tasty linguine in garlic and olive oil with fresh shrimp. Pearlz is definitely on our top ten Charlotte restaurant list after just one visit! That's a good place to be considering we eat out several times a week :-))."}
{"text":"Quality seafood in south Charlotte. I have been here a few times and I am never disappointed with my meal. Seafood is never cheap but the portion they give you makes it worth it. The cocktails are also quite good. The restaurant is small so if you are trying to go on a Saturday night be prepared to wait. The last time I went, they forgot something in our order and we waited a while for it, but they profusely apologized and took the item off of our bill....it was the hot crab dip and you need to try it. Delicious and worth the wait."}
{"text":"So im adding to my 1st review below-yes-i would still not order oysters because of my own issues as stated-we were recently back and we ordered the shrimp and grits and honestly it was heavenly. Better then Hueys in Savanna! Lobster rolls were delicious and over all-super lovely service-i look forward to my next visit. 
Im sure they recognized me from the review and were also very gracious. 

(1st 2star review) This place should be named the dirty oyster. I have never in my 30 years of eating oysters had caked dirt and sand on the shells-The owner came over and politely told me that that's the way they receive them and I appreciated that so I did some research.
Order advice is don't pick them up and put them to your lips to enjoy the natural liquor from a beautiful fresh oysters which these were however you will get a glob full of sand in your mouth-
Other than that the food was received well and the service was very nice."}
{"text":"After one bad meal we gave Pearlz a second chance - particularly since that meal followed so many excellent ones. This place was SO good when it opened but quality has quickly gone downhill. For the second time our son's fish and chips arrived at the table raw and our specials were either undercooked or overlooked. Don't know if the change has been in management, ownership or the kitchen, but something has clearly changed. It's a shame."}
{"text":"Great oysters ranging from 1.25 to 2.50 in price. The seafood platter was fresh, but fish was slightly over cooked. Good craft beer taplist and fun bar atmosphere. Service was friendly and extremely attentive."}
{"text":"My first time eating here and it was great! The food and service were amazing! Pearlz offers the best of the best when it comes to seafood. This is possibly one of the Best places to get oysters in the Charlotte area. 

I ordered 1/2 dozen steamed Oysters, Crab Dip, and Corn fritters (which is covered in powder sugar) with a lovely glass of Chardonnay. My friend and I dined at the bar, our food arrived piping hot! The service is great and the food is incredible.

Pearlz also offers great happy hour specials, I recommend taking advantage of these deals!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner.  Pics attached.  Randall our waitress was great.  Perfect service.  Loved the crab cakes and oyster tacos, as well as our house oysters!  The manager is cute.  Always love it when they stop by to make sure everything is ok."}
{"text":"Great oysters.  Delicious gumbo.  Excellent service.  Fun list of craft beers."}
{"text":"Been to the one in Columbia, SC
Pineville is quite a ways from our north Charlotte 
So we hadn't been to this one before.
Came for happy hour snacks.
Corn fritters a big let down... sadly not much flavor. And a little dry. 
Fried oysters were great and the blue cheese was good enough to drink!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see that Pearlz had expanded from Charleston to Charlotte. There aren't as many quality seafood options in Charlotte, so this was a welcome addition.  I went with a party of 7 and they easily accommodated our group. The highlight was the affordable dozen oysters appetizer at $14.95. They also had a number of daily special oysters which they flew in from around the east coast including Blue Points. For dinner, I had the Mahi Mahi filet, which was good for flavor, but unfortunately a little overcooked. Around the table, people had the tuna burger, mixed grilled fish (huge portions!), fish and chips. Overall, we had a good experience. If this was in NYC, then I would probably say 3 or 3.5 stars, but for Charlotte I'm not sure if there is a better seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out, I had pasta with shrimp and plate of Oysters. It was good. Service was good."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night with some friends. We started off with the crab dip. It was very good and creamy. It was pretty heavy too. When we ordered our food, I asked about the garlic and olive oil pasta to see if there was anything in it like veggies or if it was just straight garlic and olive oil. The server told me it was just garlic and olive oil. I added shrimp to it. Once I got my food I was pretty disappointed. My pasta was very green and salty. It definitely wasn't just olive oil and garlic. Not only that but I paid to add on shrimp and my shrimp was completely flavorless and dry. It wasn't even really seasoned. The whole meal was not good. Even the girls I was with tried my dish and wasn't pleased with it. 

My only suggestion is to NOT get the pasta here."}
{"text":"Ate a late lunch here today. Wifey wanted me to try this place. She was right the Mussels are very good as well as the calamari. The fish! The fish! OMG! It was some dam greasy I had to peel the beer batter off. DON'T GET THE FISH AND CHIPS!!!!! The chips are excellent but the fish was so greasy it made my stomach hurt for 3 hours. When I pushed the fork into the fish, the grease rose like water in a sponge. EEEK!!!! 14.50 for 8oz's of fish, that's expensive for enough fish to fit in a grade school milk carton and I didn't even finish but half of it. The funny thing is I'll probably go back again but just won't get the fish and chips."}
{"text":"So happy that we can find excellent seafood in Charlotte now.  The prices reflect that they fly in thier seafood fresh everyday, but it's so totally worth it.  We went and the joint was jumping, we opted to sit outside as we could be seated right away.  We got oysters on the half shell to start.  They were as delicous as the one's we had gotten at the Pearlz in Charleston. I got a fried Oyster Po'boy as my entree, and the Boy got the Cod sliders.  His cod sliders were good, but my Po'Boy was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  So good.  I didn't even want to share.  The portion was huge as well for the price.  This is definitely on the list of \"places I will come back to\"."}
{"text":"For Charlotte, this place is pretty amazing. Food was great, fresh, flavorful; service was friendly, prompt, welcoming; atmosphere was good. One downside - bathrooms were revolting.

We squeezed in a quick bite before a movie. I snagged an oyster flight because I wanted to try the different types of oysters. Cocktail sauce + horseradish is my garnish of choice, and I was pleased to see they had both. Massachusetts Bay fleet oysters are amazing. Yummmm!
We also had the calamari and lobster roll (omg what do they put on their house chips? delicious!) which was chock full of giant pieces of lobster. Lobster \"salad\" is usually some mix of a little bit of chopped up lobster and a medley of other things. This was basically giant pieces of lobster with some sauce and shoved into a yummy roll.

Everything tasted super fresh, and given how far we are from water, that is impressive. Very pleased, Pearlz. I'll see you again.  (Pls work on those nasty restrooms though. Thx.)"}
{"text":"Great food, love their shrimp and Grits.  Service was prompt and our server Casey was wonderful at her job ; great personality, informative, and patient.

They have a young Manager didn't catch her name , very thin young woman.  She was nice but I do t think she has the skills to run a clean efficient establishment.  We complained to both our waiter and the manager about how nasty the floors were with food all over the floor.  From the time you walk in the door to far back where we ere sitting in the restaurant.  We were told by the waiter that the bar staff sweep at the end of the day, so I guess food and crumps that are all over the floor sit until end of day.  That poses a safety issue ( slip and fall).  I hope this attitude does not carry into the kitchen!  

Mean while we went over to Dean and Deluca grocery store with 3 hour left before closing and they were sweeping their floors when something fell on the floor... hmmmmm,  maybe when the table is bust the floor should be quickly swept to prepare for the next group of people .  So we are not sitting o. Crimps or have food particles under our feet."}
{"text":"Love this place, the food and drinks where great! So glad your here in Charlotte. I had oyster rockafeller  and my husband had raw oysters with shrimp taco. The portions are large and alot bigger than Lure."}
{"text":"Really not a raw oyster type of person so held off visiting this place. We stopped in this year and actually the food was very good! I would definitely go again love the inside Decor, they totally redid it from when it was Miros. Staff is wonderful, menu selection broad, we didn't have a bad dish!"}
{"text":"Finally!!! This was my favorite oyster restaurant when I lived in Charleston, and I am beyond thrilled it has opened in Charlotte!!!!! The food quality is absolutely superb, and the drink selection involves a wide variety from their homemade brews to homemade liquors and more!!!"}
{"text":"Convenient location. Very good food and excellent service.  Oysters are fresh and  good plus they have a large selection. Especially enjoyed fried oysters and shrimp. Clam chowder is excellent. My only complaint is their seating. If there are only 2 in your party they sit you in the back along the wall. You are so close to the people next to you that you are uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Tried here a few weeks ago on 2 different occasions.  The food was good - not great but solid good.  The menu changes for some items so keep that in mind. I had a really good dish my first visit and my second order of the dish was quite different and didn't taste all that great.  The space is really nice and the servers are friendly. The oysters were good but on the small side.  Overall ok.."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying that I was born and raised in the Midwest, and as such, my knowledge of seafood is pretty limited. I'm working on it. 

I went here for dinner recently with a group of 6. We had to wait a while for our table, but we sat at the bar, shared some oysters (I'm a total newb when it comes to oysters but I loved them), and had a couple of drinks, so I didn't mind. 

Service was friendly both at the bar and at our table, though maybe a tiny bit on the slow side (in their defense, it was pretty busy). 

We couldn't commit to a bottle of wine, but I was pleased with the selection of wines available by the glass. 

I ordered the mixed grill for dinner. Everything was fantastic (oh god, the scallops were especially amazing), except one of the fishes (I think it was the wahoo but can't remember for certain) was pretty dry."}
{"text":"Pearls oyster bar carries many varieties of oysters on the half shell. When we went we sat at the bar and had a variety of oysters on the half shell with a glass of wine. They oysters were delicious and the service was great."}
{"text":"Charbroiled oysters were good, but not as good as what you can get in NOLA. Cod slider was delish as was the crab dip and shrimp and grits. The corn fritters were ok. Wouldn't get them again. Service was good too. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Love coming here!!  Tried ther NE clam chowder for the 1st time.....amazing!!  Every bite was filled with clams!!  Crab cake slider was delicious!  And of course their shrimp bloody mary is not to be missed!!  Always a friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food service have been to Charleston  Columbia store and charlotte all are equally in service and food

3/24/18. Came back to Charlotte location. Food excellent great service. Just recommend the high top tables have hooks for purses. My wife inform me of this. But love the place"}
{"text":"Officially this rating is a 4.5 out of 5 stars. Pearlz has super fresh oysters at very fair prices...about a dollar an oyster during happy hour. Their bloody mary with pickled vegetables and a big juicy shrimp on top is perfection and all other food on Pearlz's menu (from what we tasted) is quite good! We had mahi tacos, smoked salmon, raw oysters, corn fritters, crab cake, and a big bacon cheeseburger. Everything was cooked and seasoned well and fresh ingredients were used. I would have liked to have had more side dishes offered and more side dish options (a couple of our entrees came with chips and we would rather have had fries or rice), but otherwise it was a really great meal. Staff at Pearlz are very friendly and professional and the outdoor dining cannot be beat  during good weather. This restaurant is clean and comfortable with good local beer on tap, a fine cocktail and wine menu, and very reasonable prices. We would definitely return to Pearlz and are very interested in checking out their brunch. Of note, they do accommodate children (well kept, clean highchairs, crayons, and a kid's menu), but it's not even remotely kid dominated. In other words, this is a place that you can comfortably bring your children to without feeling like you're forfeiting a nice, sit down dinner at a proper adult restaurant. Kudos to Pearlz for striking that delicate balance! The 9 year old at the table next to us ate about 30 raw oysters, so, maybe a night out at Pearlz can elevate your children to junior gourmand status. Our little one was only interested in corn fritters and the crackers that came with our oysters, but he's only two years old, to be fair ;)"}
{"text":"I am disappointed in Pearlz. If you are remotely a healthy eater you will have troubles finding anything on the menu as almost everything is fried, has a cream base or super creamy sauce. To top it off the two times I've had to go there the fish did not taste fresh, very disappointing."}
{"text":"We visited Easter weekend and this was hands down some of the best food I've had in Charlotte. I seriously did not want my food to end was was trying to figure out when I could come back again before I even left. Kudos to the chef and our awesome waitress!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times and it's not bad! It's a very small restaurant and seating can be limited depending on the night and time you go, of course. The service is decent.  The food comes out fast and I have never had a bad experience.

I always get oysters because I love them. They are prepared nicely and always have a good flavor, I just hate shucking them myself!!! The crab dip is creamy and served with a hearty bread. It's very rich! Overall a good spot if you're in the area wanting seafood."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour with my friend and it was awesome! The crab cake slider was on point and the chips were nice and crispy. The crab dip was yummy as well but the chunks of bread they served it with seem to be too much! The wait staff was friendly and we had lots of fun talking to them about different restaurants in charlotte that they liked. I will be back this time with my husband :)"}
{"text":"Checked out Pearlz for dinner and enjoyed great service and a delicious meal. 

My mom ordered the garlic and oil linguine with mussels - there were tons of perfectly steamed mussels, and the pasta was alienate, with lots of garlic flavor. Everyone agreed they would order this again. 

My dad ordered the crab cake sandwich and really liked it. The crab cake was fresh and there was a good crab-to-bun ratio. It was served with homemade chips which were crunchy and yummy. 

I ordered one of the specials - the sampler. It came with four small filets - one of each of the daily special fish. They were all perfectly cooked and seasoned, served with truffle mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts. The veggies were lovely, but I didn't taste truffle in the potatoes. That being said, the texture was creamy and delicious and I enjoyed them immensely. Normally I really like swordfish, but it wasn't my favorite here - I'd recommend trying a new or different fish, since they cook it so well here. 

Highly recommend for a casual and delicious meal. Next time we'll have to check out the daily specials and order some oysters!"}
{"text":"First of all, our server DORN was awesome!! He was attentive, friendly, and knowledgable.  Frank ordered the raw oysters and said they were some of the best he's ever had. They better be, hence the name Pearlz. I ordered the fried shrimp with the Asian chili sauce. Shrimp was a little iodiney and the sauce was way too sweet. Not bad tho. I also ordered the Corn Fritters and they were delicious.! They had chopped peppers dotted throughout and they were sweet and pillowy. The only complaint that I have about them is they would be better if there was a sauce to dip into, something spicy, like a red pepper aioli to offser the sweetness of the corn. Frank ordered another half dozen of the oysters. I was gonna try the BLT TOWER WITH CRAB, but I'll save that for next time. I'll give it another try to order entrees. Overall, it was ok. No pearl found yet."}
{"text":"Consistent quality - good food and drink & props for doing a decent job of channeling the original restaurant (had an appetizer and wine). Still, it's not Charleston but nothing is (this coming from a Charlottean).  Hope it works here!"}
{"text":"I do not get the impression that they were ready to be open for business. I ordered the pickled fried oysters as a starter and was disappointed. First I received five oysters that were as small as an altoid. I could literally fit them in the palm of my hand and still have room. They also did not taste good pickled and fried. As well, the blue cheese buffalo sauce did not compliment. I also had the shrimp and grits. They were extremely bland. I had to season myself with salt and pepper. Yet the consistency of the grits were good. When I tried to order desert (because I was still hungry) the server said he had to see if they had any. My husband's poboy also looked dry and the chips were bland as well. I'll try this place once more and pray that it's a little better."}
{"text":"Nice Service. Most dishes are great. Though the Gumbo was a disappointment... But! Their Shrimps and Grit is amazing! Not a fan of the Hard Cider they offer. Taste kinda plain. But overall, they have great oysters and decent food with a very nice staff"}
{"text":"Great food and the oysters were very fresh. Great mid week specials. Sat at the bar and had great service. The seafood gumbo was outstanding as well."}
{"text":"I was craving oysters ( yes I know) anyway we came here for my birthday and loved everything from the service to the oysters to wine .  We sat at the bar and had the best experience ever ! Can't wait to go back for Monday oyster deals !"}
{"text":"My friend invited me to their soft opening night tonight. While I am aware soft opening is not indicative of their normal service, I do like to provide a sneak peak of what may to come.

I have never been to the other locations and thus have zero frame of reference, but it seems like Pearlz already has its own small Charlotte fan club from patronizing their Charleston location. My overall impression by reviewing their menu is that it offers a good selection of seafood options at a very reasonable price. If you don't like seafood (or allergic), they have plain salads, a burger and a steak to choose from.

My complimentary dinner started with half a dozen of raw oysters (this time from VA, $8.95 for 6 or $14.95 for 12). They were fresh and of good size but were little bland in taste. I was told they will have varietal oyster offerings (ex. West coast) which will be more expensive but tastier. 

My appetizer was the peel & eat shrimp ($12.50, 8 to an order, enough to share since they are the bigger shrimps). Slightly seasoned with Old Bay, they are good for the cocktail shrimp lovers. But I am spoiled by my prior fresh shrimps eating days, I found these shrimps to lack that particular bounce and \"fresh from the water\" taste. 

2nd course I chose the Oysters Rockefeller ($11.95, 5 to an order). I may say this is one of the highlights. Very flavorful, not too cheesy, a hint of bacon but not overpowering. However I didn't see the crawfish/lump crab toppings as shown on menu description, but still a solid excellent dish.

Lastly I chose the fried shrimp entree. The 2 side items semi stole the show - the homemade chips and the corn fritters. The chips (really chips, not fries) were perfectly crispy. The fritters were slightly coated in powder sugar, giving it a good contrast to the otherwise savory dish. The shrimps itself (I believe they are the same source of shrimps as the cocktail shrimps) were ok; the batter can be lighter in sodium and the weight. For $16.95 there was plenty of shrimps to go around.

Ok... I lied, that was not my \"lastly;\" the last item I had was the cup of seafood gumbo ($4.95) I added at the very end.  And it is legit. Not some tomato based fake stuff. This is the brownish good stuff - how gumbo really should be made from a dark roux. I promise, you want a cup if not a bowl of this!

Overall from the food standpoint, Pearlz offers excellent value. So shrimps are not their strength in my opinion, but the Rockefeller and the gumbo were both solid. The portion I saw on everything is good. The tuna tartare looked divine. Fried calamari tossed with peppers is on my list to try. Local beers on draft ($5) and $9 signature cocktails - tho alcohol license wasn't ready as of today. I think Pearlz is ready to shake things up in Stonecrest, and give the big chain restaurants around the corner a run for their money!"}
{"text":"The food here is good. I really enjoyed the mussels and seafood blt salad. Unfortunately, the service left much to be desired. We were never offered water, our mussels came without bread (although every other table had bread), and the manager went to every table but ours to ask how everything was. I'm giving 3 stars because a huge part of a great meal is how you're treated, to me. Perhaps next time we'll have a better experience. Worth a try for seafood lovers. Just don't expect to be wowed with the service."}
{"text":"Checked off the list of places to try. varietal oysters are good but overpriced. The poboy was big, but really bland and mostly bread, lettuce, and tomato. Homemade chips were overcooked and hard. Fish and chips (sub fries) were also bland. Scratched off the list ."}
{"text":"It is so disappointing to write this review, as I've been waiting for a great seafood place to come to the Ballantyne area for a while.  Overall quality, ambience, and service reminded me of one of those tourist trap seafood places you get sucked into by the water or on the islands.

I have to be honest as it was probably one of the worst food and restaurant experiences I've had in a while...and at $100 out the door for two people the value simply wasn't there.  Especially since we had only 1 glass of wine per person and over $80 in food.

Atmosphere:  3 stars  Meh.  I found it to be ok, nothing exceptional.    Give that a pass for personal taste.

Food and Drink:  0 to 1 Star.  
Appetizer:  Of the Dozen oysters on the sampler, about half seemed super fresh.   Very small
Main Course: 2 Stars: BLT Tower, Great presentation, but seafood was very dry and overall salad lacked any substantial flavor.  Slight Fishiness
0 Stars-  Tuna.   Again, great presentation but the Tuna was incredibly Fish, still tasting it...Had to send back after 2 bites.  Don't serve Raw tuna if it shouldn't be served
2 Stars-  Mussels-   Ok in Flavor.   Extremely Small Mussels, almost no meat to them.  The Bread served with the mussels was stale
Special- 1 Star Ordered an OMB pretzel because I couldn't eat most of the food that was presented.  Clearly had been microwaved, hard and rubbery
Wine- Selection OK, had to send 1 glass back because clearly the bottle had been open too long...tasted like soy sauce.

Funny thing is...I never send food back...I will usually just eat it and just not come back.    

Service-
Greeting and Seating-  3 to 4 stars.  Friendly
Server-  2-3 Stars, average at best.  Had to order water 3 times, never apologized for food
Overall-  1 Star.  Really, we send 2 things back, send everything else back half eaten and a restaurant that's open 6 weeks doesn't send a manager over at least.   Most of the staff and manager's time was spent huddling around the hostess desk watching the Panthers game...

It is telling that on a Sunday night at Stonecrest this restaurant was about 30 percent full...I simply can't imagine they will survive at that quality level.    REALLY wanted to enjoy it...the hunt for good seafood in Ballantyne/Stonecrest area continues."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Pearlz for the first time last night. Overall it was a positive experience and we will go back.  Our waitress was friendly, and people seemed to be having a good time. 

The reason I'm not giving them 5 Stars will make sense to some, but not to many of you. I'm from the eastern part of the state and the atmosphere was completely different from the smaller , small town eastern NC \"hole in the wall\" oyster bars I've always loved. This place is different. The atmosphere is more upscale than the oyster bars I've known in the past.

Overall I think we're lucky to have Pearlz in the area, it seems to be a great place for date night, my food was good, and I suggest you give it a try."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit...we felt a 2nd chance was warranted...but, still disappointing.  We  had 2-starters - the peel and eat shrimp and crab cakes.  Crab cakes seemed pre-made and then dropped on grill to heat up....they came out luke warm :)  Shrimp was ok...nothing to rave about.  On our first visit we had the seafood combo which was 4 pieces of different fish...all the fish was way overcooked.  We wanted to like this place, but they don't seem to have it together?  Atmosphere is lacking."}
{"text":"We live pretty far from Pearlz but were in the area on a Sunday around lunch time and gave them a try. It was a good decision!  My wife and I both love seafood and set a pretty high foodie snob bar in general no matter what we're eating whether at a dive or a fine dining place and Pearlz met the bar well.

We started with a couple cocktails, and a dozen Blue Point oysters. Bloody Mary for me and Margarita for her. Both drinks were well made and you could actually tell there was liquor in them which isn't always the case. The oysters were pricey but no more than you'd pay for non-local oysters anywhere else and they were tasty, served with cocktail sauce and a mignonette. 

I was really hungry and followed the oysters with clam chowder and a lobster roll. The chowder was good and had a ton of clams while the lobster roll was fresh, stuffed with lobster and served in a butter toasted split-top roll as it should be. 

Service was prompt and friendly. All in all, if I didn't live so far away, I'd likely have Pearlz on my regular rotation."}
{"text":"House oysters are an amazing value!  Cassie is our favorite server. Fun vibe and atmosphere.  Live music outside on the weekends is a plus!!"}
