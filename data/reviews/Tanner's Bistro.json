{"text":"We realized we were taking a risk, the reviews were mixed: mostly around inconsistent service. But we can stand that for great food, which most of the reviews included. NOT ANYMORE! The dumpling menu is gone, I believe the original chef left - which was a great decision because this place is about to go down in flames. Yes, the service was terrible. We were sat by a lovely hostess who struggled to find us a table in a mostly empty dining room (maybe 4-5 other tables when we got there had guests).  Then we waited 25 minutes to be greeted by our waiter. Most people around us got some attention, so we accepted the anomaly. We did see plenty of other patrons having to ask for silverware or return an ice bucket unnecessary for red wine, or request plates for a shared dish, but it passed the time until our waiter finally appeared and asked us what we wanted to drink. Did I mention we didn't get drink lists when we were sat? Just food menus. We made him wait while we selected a wine off the menu he brought. We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 glasses of wine. He came back 15 min later with our drinks but no food, to see if we wanted to order the rest of dinner. Luckily we made the bright decision to wait for the first course to arrive. Our crab cakes were mushy and barely hot, the tuna was bland and the bus boy kept trying to take my plate! I had had enough. We paid, left and walked to Villa Francesca who sat us within 20 minutes of arrival on Valentine's Day without a reservation and made us feel special. They were crowded, but they took great care of us. Next time I'll skip Tanner's entirely and just go to Villa Francesca. They know how to make great food and treat a patron!"}
{"text":"Myself and a big group of friends were hunting for a restaurant for our New Year's Eve dinner. It was a bit of a dice roll, but we ended up going where none of us had been before: Tanner's. Very happily, it was a great experience! The food was delicious, the atmosphere was warm, and our server was excellent.   There were a lot of dishes ordered around the table, but it seemed as though everyone was happy with their selections. I had the tilapia, but also got to sample the meatloaf and duck confit spring rolls. The menu is definitely worth exploring!   I started to describe this place as \"out of the way,\" but it really isn't. It's right across the street from Time Warner Cable Arena, which made it perfect as a pre-show restaurant.   Definitely see myself going back here."}
{"text":"Agree with some other posts, this location is tough to make a success. Just left a completely empty place after my drink had flakes of some crude in the glass.  They had only one bottle of red and nothing but Muscato for white.   The bar tender was nice and friendly but the place is a mess.  Hope First Ward can get a place that can make it some day."}
{"text":"This seems to be a cursed location.  Nothing has lasted here long.  I've never heard of Tanner's Bistro and when I showed up I thought that location was a sushi place.  The menu was a small tastes menu.  I LOVE tapas, but $8 for a vegetarian eggroll?  I know a quality chinese place that will sell one made in house for $1.50.  Overall, nothing I ordered was especially mind-blowing with the exception of the salad, which I shared with a friend.    It took over an hour from the time we ordered until we received our food.    Service was excellent and we were given a plate of samples and a round of drinks for our wait."}
{"text":"I was actually here with a group of people a few days ago. The scenery and location is actually great. The service was quick and our server knew a lot about the menu. She was able to answer all our questions and even recommended an appetizer for us. Something that really bugged me all night long was how our server was chewing gum. I think it's disrespectful and completely unprofessional to be a server at a venue like this and chew gum. She never even tried to spit it out or stop chewing while she talked to us. I'll really reconsider recommending this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Tanners is a nice upscale bar spot with great food. The only issue that I've had is with some of the bar  tenders, they tend to move a little slow and not be very attentive to their patrons. Other than that it's a nice spot to grab a drink with your girls or with your man."}
{"text":"I visited this place for a Claflin University alumni function. The atmosphere is very upscale. Very appropriate for the Uptown area. The alumni event was a mixer and Tanner's provided us with an open space downstairs fitted with comfortable seating. I was really impressed. We also had a very nice server. The food choices for the private event included wings and Crab Rangoons. Both awesome!   The food and service was great, so my friend and I visited again the same weekend. This time, we had Turkey Burger, Mac & Cheese, Garlic and Parmesan Shoestring Fries, Wings and Crab Rangoons. At the mixer, we had to share with others, but one-on-one these items never had a chance. The Turkey Burger was prepared just right and the Mac & Cheese was good too.   The restaurant is ideal for events. There was a bridal shower happening as we dined. My only complaint is parking. I get it, the restaurant is right next to the Time Warner Arena, but if I'm dining, can it at least be validated. Other than that it was a great place. I'd recommend it and likely return."}
