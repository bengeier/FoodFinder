{"text":"Ah.. the ever-elusive perfect panzerotti. I have yet to find you outside of Windsor. 

Let me give you a brief background of my panzerotti affair. When I went to University (of Windsor.. please withold your judgements haha), I was a busy bee working 6 days a week. My day off was Sunday, and by then I was always pooped. So I'd stay in bed, order a panzerotti to be delivered, and watch tv all day. My \"Panzerotti Sundays\" were sponsered by Pizza Plus. Man. BEST panzerotti ever.. thick dough, perfectly deep-fried, perfect ratio of sauce-to-cheese-to-crunch-to-chewiness. I was in love. I left Windsor to hang out in Banff for a while, where, to my shock and horror, a Panzerotti is completely unheard of!! They have \"calzones\" which some will tell you is exactly the same. No, no they are not. They are a weak little brother to the mighty panzerotti. 
But I digress.
I moved back to Ontario a couple of months ago, my panzerotti cravings completely washed away and forgotten. I've been on this vegan-raw kick lately and honestly a deep-fried folded pizza hasn't even crossed my mind.
Enter the massive hangover.
I'd noticed \"Panzerotto\" in my neighborhood and when I was ready to die from alcohol withdrawl symptoms the tagline \"The original Panzerotto\" played like a broken record inside my head. So I forgot about vegan/raw/any sort of health and called the hotline number and ordered me an \"Original Panzerotto\" (which was in itself a weird experience, because I called the number 222-2221, was sent to an operator, placed my order, and was then called back from the Yonge-Alexander location confirming my order.. why couldn't we have skipped the first step?).

Anyways. I go to pick it up and noticed a few things right away
1- they had pre-made panzerottis sitting in that little heated pizza-display case. Weird, no?
2- my panzo came in.. a bag? I didn't like seeing grease stains. I KNOW what I'm about to do to my body and I don't need a see-through paper bag to make me any more aware of it. Not to mention the fact that anyone who saw me got the clear impression I don't give a shit about my health. Which I do. So I would have appreciated a more discreet option, like a pizza box, and then I could at least pretend it was a pizza that I was taking home to share with others.
Anyway.
So I get home, a little put-off but still super stoked for my first panzo in well over a year.
Imagine my disappointment. First, I'm pretty sure it wasn't pizza dough, but some other panzerotti-specific dough. Which kinda let me down. Second.. I dunno actually. It was just really disappointing. Not that cheesy, not that crispy, not that doughy... I was actually kinda mad at myself for wasting my junk food day on it.

I will however give them kudos for price. It came to $6, I think. I had mushrooms, pineapple, and onion in it. Not bad. Definitely not great. I'll continue my hunt for a good panzerotti... next time I'm super hung.

Also: the diff between panzerotti/panzerotto? no idea. quality I suppose! stick with the 'i'.. 
There may be no 'I' in 'team', but there must always be one in Panzerotti!!!"}
{"text":"I am a professional woman in my mid-20's, and I live roughly 5 blocks from this location.

I went out on saturday night, and on my way home, I was followed and attacked by a man on Yonge street. I managed to make an escape, and ran into the nearest lit place, which happened to be this restaurant. I was extremely distressed, and begging for someone to call the police (my cell phone had died an hour earlier), while the man stood outside, forcefully kicking the window and making threatening gestures at me. I was terrified for my life, and nobody in the restaurant bothered to call the police, or offer me a phone to do so. 

They falsely assumed the man was my boyfriend, and decided not to do anything about it, despite my telling them over and over that I had never seen this man in my life. I was not on drugs, I hadn't had a single drink, nor was I dressed like a prostitute or a homeless person. The employees here had no reason to believe I was in any way related to my sketchy-looking attacker. 

The man who stalked and attacked me got away as a result, and is still loose somewhere in my neighborhood. 

One of the employees here believed me when I said I didn't know the man, but his co-workers quickly brushed him off, and no effort was made to call the police by any of them. He gave me a bottle of water, and told me to stay put, while they let my attacker get away unscathed.

I live in the area, and am now terrified to leave my apartment. The indifference of the men working here could end up costing someone their life, as their refusal to call to police has given this predator the opportunity to do it again.

I would like to thank the one employee who believed me, and gave me the bottle of water. However, a call to the police would have been much more appreciated. 

I would say that I'll never eat here, but that point seems redundant, given the fact that I'm too terrified to set foot on Yonge street at all, after this experience.

I'm sure the food is good here, but for those of you who are in danger and are expecting to be rescued, don't hold your breath. You may get a free bottle of water, but you won't find a hero, or anyone who's willing to call for one."}
{"text":"Chicken pizza and a pop for 5 bucks. Not a bad deal at all. The panzer otto's in the display looked kinda gross. If you're in the area, its not a bad choice but consider looking around before you settle for this stuff."}
