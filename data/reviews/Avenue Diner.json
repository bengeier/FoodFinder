{"text":"I've been to Avenue quite a few times and am usually very happy with it. The food is great, but way too expensive to go often. The grilled cheese is my favourite but you have to pay to add on anything (and the grilled apples are the same price as the chicken, what?). Sometime's the salad it comes with has some iffy lettuce (which would be alright anywhere else but when it's 14+ dollars it's not ok). It would be nice if they had a few more vegetarian options on the menu, or at least a few healthier vegetarian options on the menu (rather than french toast, pancakes, macaroni, etc). My two favourite dishes (macaroni and grilled cheese) are definitely the same idea as what they serve at Farm, except Farm's are definitely better.  I love the atmosphere - and it's definitely one of Calgary's best downtown restaurants. A great place to take a friend."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in town. Every detail is perfectly executed. The freshness of the ingredients is exceptional year round. The various club sandwiches are great. Unlike the new burger joints people are flocking to The Ave has done a great hamburger for years."}
{"text":"Breakfast - yes! A long, leisurely breakfast with a good friend in an up-market, downtown, cozy, restaurant including either the signature omelette (w/ organic spinach, forest mushrooms & aged Canadian Cheddar) or the Scrambled egg & Yukon Gold breakfast burrito w/ achiote & savoury red pepper jelly OR one of Avenue's signature eggs bennys. Then again, maybe the maple fried steel-cut oatmeal w/ vanilla bea n cream & Mom's super lemony lemon curd or fruit and yogurt parfait w/ in-house made granola & four-berry compote. Absolutely fabulous breakfasts all.   Start your downtown day at Avenue, and head to Arts Central, the Glenbow ...."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place in the city, worth parking downtown for.   Hash browns are great, anything with fruit is great, and I do like the Mac and Cheese (really not how Mom made it).  Definitely worth going to, and worth the wait (if you get there later in the morning)."}
{"text":"It is a great casual place for business breakfast/lunch or sunday brunch with the family.  Great staff, fast service!!!"}
{"text":"Food was out of this world!! The servers were great, super friendly, and the food was to die for. There is a wait if  you don't get there early enough but they offer free coffee to those who are waiting. Seriously, do not miss this place!! We couldn't wait to get up in the mornings to go and eat there!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times because of work, and if others didn't pick this place, neither would I. Small menu, okay staff, and it only gets three stars because the food's pretty good, depending on what you have,but waaaay over priced for what it's worth. $15.00 for mac'n' cheese? What? Really?"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast around!  The food was absolutely amazing.  Flavourful, good size portions, great atmosphere...  Love, love...  If your in C-town, definitely a place to get your eat on!"}
{"text":"I love Avenue Diner.  Reminds me of the 50's when service was good and so was the food. Rare to come by these days! It can be a little expensive, but I am in love with the mac n cheese  they have. Its best if the weather is good outside and you can sit outside and scope out all the people!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this diner for 2 years now, great chef \"Paul!!\" and waitress are nice as well, people are complaining it expensive but look at the location!!! Avenue and davenport  is the most expensive place in the city, food is. Good , just your average selection of \"pub food\" ..... I think it is a fabulous diner and will be returning !!"}
{"text":"I like the dated subway long decor but that's about it. Toast and egg for $$$ and mediocre coffee. Again no no."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, service and cool retro ambiance - straight out of a movie set. Great diner fare, amazing milkshakes and very fair pricing, particularly given the proximity to Yorkville!"}
{"text":"If you have small children and are looking for a good place to have breakfast with your family, this is NOT the right one. The food is good and most of the staff is friendly. In fact, I considered myself a frequent client at this restaurant and every time I had a chance I would take family and friends there. Never again. This morning I took my in-laws visiting from abroad for breakfast. I have a 17-month-old son and as every toddler that age, he has the tendency to be a bit noisy, talk loud and try to get attention. Since the beginning, we noticed that one member of the staff was not very happy to have him there. She tried being subtle at first by making faces every time he was a bit loud.  If you have children you will know how when someone is not nice towards your child it hurts you even more than if they were not nice to you. By the end of our meal my son wanted to get off his high chair, was standing by my side and sat on the floor by the hall. Then the same \"unfriendly\" person asked me to move him right away because he was in her way. I understood that he was in the way and wanted to move him without him making scene but she did not give me time and repeatedly and rudely asked me to move him. When I told her we were about to leave she kept on insisting. Obviously this person doesn't have kids, I thought, and has no idea on how to talk to the customers. I told her she didn't need to be so rude but she kept on going on and on. Her attitude surprised me and so I asked her name (I thought the manager would like to talk to her about being compassionate and understanding) but to my surprise, her response was \"Heather Chell, and if you want to talk to the manager, that's me, and if you want to talk to the owner, that's me\". I was so shocked by this that I could say nothing else but leave and make sure that I would never come back there again. I am writing this because I was shocked by the lack of tolerance she showed with my son. If you have a baby/toddler and want him to be treated right, please go somewhere else."}
{"text":"What an awful experience. We ordered a grilled cheese, a tuna sandwich, and a tossed salad, with a hot chocolate on the side. The grilled cheese was literally a piece of American cheese between two pieces of bread. Nothing else. The tuna sandwich was not bad, but nothing special (just tuna salad and lettuce and tomato). The salad was literally a mess of some iceberg lettuce and a few chopped pieces of tomato. Oh, and one slice of cucumber. We had to ask twice for dressing, and at one point the cook asked me to get out of my seat to pick up the grilled cheese from him, rather than just having the waiter bring it over. The hot chocolate was abysmal - lukewarm and overly sweet.  I can't believe that anyone in good conscious would charge $25 for the meal I just described. This place may have the nostalgia factor going for it, and maybe we would've been happier had we ordered the usual breakfast fare, but we were really unimpressed."}
{"text":"I've been to the Avenue Diner tons, but yesterdays lunch was incredible!  I had the Fresh Tomato & Balsamic Eggs Benedict and a nice bubbly mimosa -- it was mindblowing.  The balsamic with the hollandaise creates an epic taste in your mouth and the eggs are incredibly fresh.  Not to mention, the staff at the Avenue is ever so lovely.  I love the atmosphere in that restaurant, always so clean and crisp and full of happy people munching on amazing breakfast foods. A+"}
{"text":"Quaint old school dinner. But that's where the positives end. Nothing special about this place other than its age."}
{"text":"On the atmosphere, service and location, this place is great. Friendly folks, lots of well-known locals coming through and a bright sunshiny room.   If only it wasn't a restaurant, this place would be great.  I had a cheese omelet (hard, overlooked, no cheese to speak of, with Unidentifiable crunchy bits in it), potatoes (tasteless, rubbery) and back bacon (like leather - texture was like it must have been sitting on the grill for weeks). Sad, because this place is in my neighborhood, and I'd love to be a regular here..."}
{"text":"Sat down happy, left hopping mad.  Light lunch for 4 adults and 2 kids came to just over 90 bucks. Seating was sort of lousy, but acceptable-right next to the kitchen. I had kids with me-one toddler, one breastfeeding 3-week-old. Sort of tiresome upscale diner atmosphere. Had the corned beef hash and eggs-good! My pals had spinach salad with salmon-reportedly average. My 2-year-old had a kids' meal-eggs, also good.  Experience still smooth up to that point.  Time was 1:30-ish, lunch was over, and the diner was virtually empty at that point.  My kid wanted to rip around and play with the oh-so-hip tractor seats they have at the front counter. They made a bit of a \"squawk\" as he turned each one. I was practically holding his hand. My fellow diners smiled patiently. Then things went downhill fast. The maid behind the bar gave me the \"knock-it-off/slash-the-neck\" sign, as if she was way too busy earning her $8/hr to deal with me and my super bratty kid. As I opened my mouth to respond, a blond dame in a power suit rushed over and admonished my son and me: \"People are trying to dine\" she sneered.  At this point my jaw dropped. I responded, flustered, \"Well, he's only 2, and we were just about to leave anyway (I had already provided my credit card), and besides...RELAX. Lemme talk to the manager. She was the manager. Urge to kill rising... I had just spent 90 bucks on a so-so meal. I was about to leave. I paid the bill already. It's not like my kid whipped down his pants and peed all over the floor.   PUT UP AN \"ADULTS ONLY\" SIGN THEN! I raged. The hipper-than-thou (I'm assuming) childless owner skulked back to the kitchen. I followed to retrieve my coat (which was back there-remember?) and offered some threatening stares, but stopped short of turning over tables and smashing coolers as I reasoned this would be a poor course of action.  The waitress apologized for the manager's behaviour, though it wasn't her fault. How could it be?   Conclusion... the owner-cum-manager's attitude sucks. Lucky to get two stars. Don't take your kids."}
{"text":"This is a classic diner. The type I grew up on. The staff and service is great. The decor is old school.   The menu has all the essentials. Breakfasts, burgers, hot plates, steaks & shakes. I'm hooked on their classic two egg, ham, home fries. Their home fries are classic macedonian greasy spoon.   The only reason I haven't given 5 stars is because I haven't explored the menu fully - therefore I can't honestly vouch for the full menu. But I'm sure it'll be as good as I hope.   Love this place. One of the last original diners in Toronto."}
{"text":"The word \"diner\" to me conjures up a bullet-shaped silver building with squeaky maroon booths, grease-stained menus, and middle-aged servers named Darlene or Brenda with funny hats. I was a little disappointed that I experienced none of these things, but cheered up immensely by the clean and bright interior, spacious counter, friendly service, and delicious food. My plate of eggs, hash, and buffalo sausage arrived with an intoxicating aroma of maple syrup and flecked with green onion. Ingenious.   I was alone, so sat at the counter reading a book and was never disturbed by too-loud music or noise level. The music selection of classic R&B was an appropriate choice, although the same Stevie Wonder song was playing when I walked past an hour later. Be wary of looping albums. Prices are reasonable, but a little high for a diner and type of food they're serving, but you're paying that extra bit for a nice atmosphere and the guarantee you won't get disgruntled Darlene."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  Avenue Diner has clearly been around for a long time and tends to cater to an old-regular clientele.  This place gets points for great ambience and friendly, attentive staff. It's an old-school, classic diner featuring burgers, shakes, breakfast items, and sandwiches. The staff were polite and kept our coffee cups filled.   The food, however, just wasn't great. We ordered the cheeseburger, club sandwich, and a side of fries. The fries were straight out of a grocery store freezer bag and the burger patty was dry. It was all reminiscent of a mass-produced junior high school cafeteria lunch.   There aren't a lot of restaurants around Avenue and Davenport where you can have a relaxed meal without much fuss, and this was a refreshing change. If only the food was better..."}
{"text":"Not really a brunch kind a guy lol but I was urged to go with a friend and although there was a bit of a wait which we was told would be 15-25 minutes, it turned out to be only about 10.  From what I could see its really as soon as a seat(s) for you group size comes available you are seated whether it be at the long bar or at a table/booth. We sat right by the kitchen at a table which was ok enough room although it is a little cramped being a long narrow room, service was good and friendly, we both had the eggs benny mine smoked salmon which was really good, only fault is its so busy and quite noisy so if your nursing a bad head then maybe not the place for you!  I would go again but maybe on a less busy day, but maybe location and how good the food is maybe there always busy, definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Would not recommend this place. I had a ham and Cheese sandwich which was ok, but I ordered a salad. It consisted on lettuce, 2 slices of cucumber and 1 slice of tomato cut into 4, and they charge $6 for that, what a joke!"}
{"text":"Based on today's breakfast, I think they have stopped trying. They used to have great multi-grain toast that they no longer serve. The home fries were room temperature and tasteless. Come for the authentic diner vibe, but don't expect much from the food. Disappointing."}
{"text":"We had originally planned to head to Canmore to brunch but wanted to stay in town to save time.  In hindsight, this wasn't really a well thought out plan.  We got to Avenue Diner at around 10:45.  We had a party of three (me, hubs & our 3 yr old).  There was a wait but it didn't look too bad.  They told us that it would be about 30 minutes.  We sat down to wait.  We ended up waiting for an hour for a table.  Avenue Diner is set up to be mostly tables of 2.  Many, many 2 tops were seated while we waited.  Also, the counter is NOT okay for kids. The stools are too far away from the counter for anyone but adults. Thankfully my 3 yr old was content to play with my iPod while we waited.  When we finally got a table, the waitress was there immediately and gave us a fruit bowl for our little guy since she knew we had been waiting forever.  My husband got the corned beef hash and I got the spicy chicken sandwich.  We got a single pancake with a side of sausage for the little guy.    The corned beef hash was AMAZING.  So, so yummy.  I would go back for that for sure.  The spicy chicken sandwich was also very good but a bit hard to eat.  The food came out quickly and our waitress was top notch.    Overall I thought the food was great & I would definitely go back without a 3rd person.  I do think the prices are a bit high for what it is.  This is why I gave them a 3 instead of a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Good food, nice diner space. Excellent menu with a wide range of local ingredients being used. Only does breakfast then closes (too bad as it would be a great night spot for comfort food (e.g. some warm Mac & Cheese, Roast Beef & Gravy, Shepard's Pie)  One thing I find is that the kitchen is very slow and that breakfast takes forever to get cooked. You had best be patient especially if you visit in a large group or with small children."}
{"text":"Breakfast - Very good, fresh fruit was very fresh, my eggs weren't runny, and the bacon was crisp and tasty, not overcooked or undercooked. Definitely a great place for a good breakfast. Unfortunately the horrible service we received ruined my experience beyond recovery.  We came in on a Saturday morning, just a little after 10 AM or so. It was pretty quiet, maybe 2 or 3 tables at the back and that was about it. Seemed like things were moving pretty quickly, so I didn't have any concerns about slow or poor service when we were seated. Boy was I wrong. Now I can give someone the benefit of the doubt and accept a few mistakes with service, we're all people, we have shitty days, make mistakes, it's normal... No big deal. What I can't accept is both rude behaviour and drastically incompetent service continuously.  After being seated, it took about 12-15 minutes for the waitress to come and ask us for drinks, at a time when she was standing at the kitchen doing absolutely nothing. From there, it took another 10 minutes for us to receive our drinks. Now if the service had improved from this point on, I wouldn't have cared... She didn't even come back to take our order, I had to flag her down about 10 minutes after receiving our drinks, we politely mentioned that we were ready to order, and received a rude remark about how she wasn't ready and then she walked off. 10 minutes pass, and hey guess what, she's back to take our order, exceptionally grumpy while doing so.  The food arrived relatively quickly, though my friend's order was screwed up, we asked the waitress if he could get a new order, she remarked that it was fine and he could eat it the way it was... It took a bit of arguing on our behalf to have her send it back to the kitchen to correct.  At this point we were both pretty livid, this is just horrible service, so I go up to the little bar at the front and ask to speak to the manager or someone in charge. A few minutes later I get to speak to someone and explain our situation... seems that we've caught them off guard, this person stands there staring at us for a few minutes and then proceeds to tell me that we couldn't have received service that poorly, they only hire great staff. I hate complaining, I almost never do, even when I receive poor service, but this time, it was well warranted and instead of taking my complaint and making me a happy customer, you basically tell me I'm lying? Someone needs to take Customer Service 101. Finally after some more explaining while trying to remain calm the \"manager\" says they'll talk to the waitress in question and thanked us for our input. Now we've spent 40+ minutes WAITING for service and food, in a restaurant that is essentially dead, once our food arrived it wasn't correct as to our order specifications, and our service was beyond poor. We receive a thanks for our complaint and are expected to pay full price for this bullshit?  Needless to say, I haven't been back since. Now I've read all of the reviews prior to writing mine, and do realize that this doesn't seem to be a normal pattern of behaviour, but this was just so bad that it needed to be documented."}
{"text":"I had the carrot waffles with spicy butter for breakfast here and I have to say this was the equal best waffles I've had (with Penelope in NYC). If I lived in Calgary I would definitely be back here. The service was very friendly and maybe we went early (at 10am) because we were seated straightaway but by the time we left there was quite a long queue for a seat."}
{"text":"Awesome diner atmosphere with friendly staff to match. The food was fresh and very good. Breakfast of egg omelette and french toast hit the spot. Prices for downtown Toronto are very reasonable. You don't leave stuffed... But you are very content."}
{"text":"We came in and had to wait for a table. I think that is very common here as its usually pretty busy.   I decided to order the corned beef hash with in-house braised brisket, a sunny side farm egg and citrus-basil Hollandaise sauce. I ordered a side of bacon because, well, it just felt right.  The dish came all mixed together and had some sprouts on top. This would not be a choice of mine, but they were very crunchy and tasty which created a nice flavor as well as a nice texture.  I actually enjoyed this dish. Its not my usual steak and eggs but it was pretty good.   I have been here before and I ordered the eggs benny with tomato, fresh basil and reduced balsamic. I remember it to be good but small and not really like eggs benny.   One of the girls had a side special for the day with her meal that had zucchini, dried cherry and cream cheese sauce. According to half the table that tried it, it was amazing. It didn't sound like my thing so I skipped it.   This is a nice trendy place to come once in a while, but I couldn't eat here every day."}
{"text":"Amazing eggs benny. Trendy ambiance too."}
{"text":"great neighbourhood, awful restaurant. the chicken in the chicken fingers is reconstituted, tasteless, and disgusting. the burgers are burnt to a crisp and tasteless (according to the husband, i don't eat red meat). the prices aren't good, and the decor is extremely shabby. we gave this place three tries because we used to live nearby, but we always ended up with a huge stomach ache  also has anyone else noticed that the sign on the outside is a huge penis? just thought i'd mention it."}
{"text":"I respectfully disagree with my fellow Avenue Diner reviewer. The Avenue Diner has been in business for over fifty years, and while it's a little rough around the edges, it's definitely worth at least 2.5 stars.  I live very close by and stop in a few times a year and have always enjoyed the lunch lady and her son. It's a neighbourhood joint that makes people feel at home every time.  The pros: AMAZING home fries, classic glass Coke Bottles and savoury homemade soup.  The Cons: a bit pricey, runny eggs and small portions.  In my opinion, the Pros definitely outweigh the Cons. Give it a shot- if it's lasted half a century, it can't be THAT bad right?   PS- Fellow Yelpers: Be careful with the 1-Star reviews. In order for Yelp Newbies to trust our opinions, I believe it's important to save the 1-Star and 5-Star reviews for extreme cases, good or bad. Otherwise, it makes the site kinda unrelieable I believe.  PPS- Yelp needs to start offering .5 review options. I would've given The Avenue Diner a 2.5-Star review as an example.."}
{"text":"First off - this is a small diner.  About 7 tables and some counter space. Probably well liked in the neighbourhood for quick take out.  I did have a great BLT on rye here, but I must say it was rather expensive for the offering.  This accounts for a 2 star rather than a 3 star rating.  My husband had the nut loaf (like a danish) and I had a BLT, we both had coffees and with tip it was over $15.  I think that is expensive, especially since it was the sandwich alone (no sides not even a pickle).  So, if you want a good sandwich or breakfast in this area, it's fine -- but don't be surprised if you somewhat wince at the price.  It is Davenport and Avenue Road.  They do have some interesting items like Tuna BLT and Chicken Salad BLT.  These I normally only see in the US.  So I will probably be glad to check it out.  Access is TTC, walking or street parking on Davenport or Avenue."}
{"text":"On the hunt for pancakes this morning, I stumbled onto the Avenue Diner. Fresh decor and the open floor plan were inviting. There is a cozy dining room in the back, but today I sit at the counter with the latest collection of Sedaris short stories.   Since I know exactly what I want, I did not see the menu... but I hear it is loaded with local suppliers and healthy ingredients. My pancakes were whole wheat flax seed, and they were happy to oblige my request to add bananas to them. My bacon came out crispy, but not burnt... just the way I like it and I did not have to ask.   I would agree that it is slightly over-priced, my tab was $24, and all I had was the aforementioned and a cup o' joe. They only charged me $1 for the added bananas, though, which was a pleasent surprise.  Over all, nice place for an enjoyable weekend breakfast."}
{"text":"GREAT BREAKFAST!! Okay, so breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and I'm not willing to pay $20 for breakfast at the Marriott.  So, a co-worker and I ventured out for breakfast and came upon this little spot.  I ordered the eggs and yukon gold potatoes.  OMG, was it good!! The eggs were so fresh and cooked perfectly.  The potatoes were so yummy and buttery.  Even the toast and jam were delicious.  My co-worker got the Maple fried steel-cut oatmeal.  That was amazing, too!!!! With all the choices on the menu, I would find it hard to order something that wasn't good here.  And, the service is so friendly.  Bottom line: If you are in search of a good breakfast spot in Calgary, look no further!"}
{"text":"This place is a character breakfast/brunch/lunch spot in t.o. You want a diner ... a diner is what you get here.  Keepin it simple.  The next reviews call this 'rough around the edges' ... no way.  My other fav spoon down the road \"Peoples\" is the rough one ... The Ave is classy, clean and stylish in comparison.  Both have owners and staff who are like 110 years old, but make you feel welcome from the moment you arrive.  Not like grandma's house welcome, more like the wierd cat lady but she's funny-cool invited us in for cookies ok cool lol."}
{"text":"GREAT breakfast spot downtown.  I love breakfast and Avenue dinner delivers.  The one thing that I really enjoyed about Avenue dinner is the fresh squeezed OJ, which every brunch place should have.    The menu has a great selection of items and everything that I tried was very well executed.  I had the carrot cake waffles, which was like desert for breakfast!  However, even though you would think this would be incredibly sweet it was actually nicely balanced.  I strongly recommend, especially if you are in downtown on a weekend morning."}
{"text":"My new favorite Saturday morning diner in Calgary.  Great food.  Wonderful ambience.  Prompt service with warm sincere smiles.  Be prepared to wait in line if you come in multiples on a busy  morning but it's worth the wait.  If you're waiting however, don't worry because there is free flowing coffee while you wait.    Feel free to go alone.  The counter is an excellent place for you.  And chances are you do not have to wait at all 'coz they can easily fit you in at the counter.  Bring your favorite morning paper or a book that you've been meaning to read... and find your new breakfast spot.  As for the smiles...  somehow they seem to have very warm smiles.  Makes you want to smile back and have a good day."}
{"text":"This may have been the most over-priced terrible food we have ever seen in the city of Toronto. Packaged gravy, mccains fries, disgusting coleslaw, amateur (tasteless) sandwiches, etc. The water was okay."}
{"text":"We ate breakfast at Avenue Diner twice during a visit to Calgary.  Enjoyed it both times.  Service was good even though it was busy.  The carrot cake waffels were delicious.  My kids did great there as well.  They enjoyed the food and loved the hot chocolate with whipped cream that our waitress fixed for them.  I will be back for breakfast next trip to Calgary!"}
