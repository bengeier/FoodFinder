{"text":"went for the $1 oyster after 5pm deal, my bf and I had 4 dozen of those. They're smaller in size but very tasty, i particularly like the sauce. Good deal."}
{"text":"First on my Summerlicious '10 hit list was Biff's Bistro, an Oliver and Bonacini restaurant. Having had a great experience at Auberge du Pommier (S09) and an even better one at Canoe (S08), I was anticipating a great lunch. Biff's Bistro definitely delivered!  Chickpea butter The buns (white) were nice and soft - freshly warmed and came with a generous chunk of chickpea butter. I'll shamelessly admit that I slathered it on like calamine after camping. Not as amazing as previous O&B bread baskets, but not bad - not too crusty, and not some crumby (hah! get my pun?) store-bought thing.  Salmon tartare with crème fraîche & summer radish Yum - a perfect patio appetizer. The salmon was fresh and subtly marinated and the crème fraîche had a nice light consistency to accompany its tangy flavour. The lemon zest was slightly candied (but not too sweet which is how I like it!), the radishes were crunchily fresh, and the single olive (which I happily halved) was stuffed with something deliciously pink (should have taken a picture and asked what it was! Now I'm super curious. Lesson learned.). This was the favourite of the ladies that I was lucky enough to lunch with :) ...but not mine!  Summer tomato & spinach tartlette with pistou  This was my favourite. Surprising, considering that there was a gazpacho in the mix. I am a huge fan of flaky pastries that aren't so shiny that you can see your face as you eat it. I was also pleasantly surprised with the size - I assumed that the tartlette would be a round little thing and we'd have to battle it out with our forks. The pistou that accompanied the dish had a slight flavour, but the spinach did most of the (delicious) work.  Gazpacho with shrimp hache & crème fraîche I will admit that I was a tad surprised at the presentation of the gazpacho. I'm used to seeing the dollop of crème fraîche and a little more care with the overall presentation. This was my most anticipated appetizer, and while good it was a tad too creamy for my taste. Still, I love a good tomato-based anything so when my friends said that I could gobble up the rest...I happily obliged. So far, the gazpacho at Boulevard Cafe is still this summer's winner. As with our appetizers, our entrees came in good time:  Baked salmon with haricot salad & sauce verte The bed of salad was nicely done - definitely enjoyed the haricot greens and beans, and it was perfectly cooked (oh how I hate overcooked beans). I usually avoid salmon from restaurants - too many experiences of overcooked fillets leaving me wanting to go home and sear my own salmon steak. This was not bad - one end was quite nice and juicy, while the other end was a bit overcooked. Half a win, so half a chance that I'll re-order salmon at a restaurant in the future.  Smoked ham & Gruyère crêpe with Dijonaise Well well. Who would've expected a ham and cheese crêpe to be so good? The cheese definitely sold the crêpes, which were pleasantly warm and had nice, salty cooked ham tucked inside.  Caramelized onion & chèvre frittata with arugula & preserved tomato What was so special about this frittata? Nada. It was nice, but next to the other two entrees the flavour was lacking. A nice dish, but I wouldn't order it again. I liked the sundried tomato - but is that really a surprise? Nevertheless, it was time for dessert!  Assorted Cookies  Cookies! A nice sampling of cookies, but nothing to write home about. It certainly made for a nice picture. I like my cookies moist, not dry, and naturally I liked the chocolate square in the back the most.   Lemon cake with blueberry compote & lemon crème Yum! I love lemon desserts. Bring on the lemon tarts, candied lemon rinds, sour lemon candies, and lemon poppy seed bread any day. This cake was really light and fluffy - not so much moist as really well aerated. The lemon flavour was very subtle, and paired quite well with the lemon crème (so I was glad that the cake wasn't too strong). The blueberry compote was a nice balance, although I've had better at Canoe with (surprise, surprise) with their lemon meringue tart.  Warm flourless chocolate torte with strawberries & Grand Marnier Like many girls, I love chocolate. A chocolate torte? You have to beat me away with a stick. As I am not well-versed when it comes to liquers I can't really comment on the Grand Marnier strawberry mix, except to say that it complimented the warm, soft torte extremely well. It was not too sweet, and the torte was very rich so the flavours blended quite nicely. My favourite out of the three, hands down.  Overall, I was very happy with my Summerlicious lunch at Biff's Bistro. For $15 prixe fix, you get quite the sampling. I wholeheartedly recommend it, and noticed that they have $1 oysters after 5pm! Given their nice, spacious patio and location near the entertainment district, Biff's is great for a night out or a casual lunch. Will return for non-licious menu!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience at Biff's Bistro lately. We went there for our first wedding anniversary to use some Oliver and Bonnacini vouchers, and we were surprised by how much food we got - we didn't even end up using anywhere near the total value of the voucher. The service was very good and the food delicious. They even had a little anniversary dessert and champagne for us - a nice touch. My only qualm was with the saltiness of the food. I actually tend to like saltier foods more than I should, but even for me this was on the saltier side. Nonetheless, a great experience."}
{"text":"3.5/5  I have dined at Biff's Bistro a few times now and I can say this restaurant is good, but not overly mind blowing. It nonetheless is a solid choice for a night out.   I had the Winterlicious 2016 menu last night. I didn't enjoy the appetizer (smoked whitefish) as it seemed like a bunch of vegetables thrown together. The dessert (bread pudding) was different... it was more of a french toast than a bread pudding. The entree (filet of beef) was perfectly cooked and tender. The sauce also went very well with the dish.   The service was a bit weird though. We arrived 15 min early and were instructed to sit at the bar as the table was not ready, yet the restaurant was mostly empty at the time. The tables are also quite closer together so you can hear other people's conversation quite easily. Throughout the night we could hear glasses falling and breaking.   Can't give a strong yay or nay for Biff's Bistro, but I would still go back as it's located quite conveniently to the downtown core.   Parking details can be found on the website... \"Underground parking is $2 after 5:30pm upon validation at the restaurant and is accessible off Scott Street, one block east of Yonge.\""}
{"text":"Super nice, efficient, professional service. Mediocre food. Nice atmosphere. A solid 3 stars. It's probably useful to note, though, that this place as a 'high end', 'upscale' restaurant would sink rapidly in any other major city due to the food. I'll definitely return, but I'm sticking to the bar and the appetizers."}
{"text":"I came here with a co-worker for a Summerlicious lunch. The patio was beautifully shaded and we were very happy with our table. We both ordered the Salmon Mousse as an appetizer, which was very refreshing and light. I had the Crepe as my entree, and although I enjoyed it, I wouldn't say it was a stand-out meal. Service was quite slow, with our lunch taking an hour and a half. Overall, nothing too memorable and there are other more unique restaurants that I prefer."}
{"text":"i'm here for the food, which is seriously as good as it gets! The ambiance and atmosphere has my thumbs up too, but let's not digress...we're here for classic french cuisine and i'm keen to see if there's any other restaurant in Toronto that can upseat the #1 Didier.  For the hors d'oeuvres, i ordered frog legs which is a uniquely Provencal dish. Well fried in fritto batter and soft moist meat indicates care and technique. Saucing was a tiny bit on the sweet side for me, i understand the chef is trying to go the off-beat route for a classic dish but if he would just reduce the sweetness by 15% it would be a perfect dish that's accompanied by perfect greens with a hint of vinaigrette.   Steak tartare was perfectly done all around, and we ordered more due to its quality marinations, and prescient pairing with sweetbreads that begged for more!  Also, tried the oysters which were a great bargain for $1 per half-shell after 5pm. However, i'm no oyster aficionado but it's considered decent for its price by my dining friends who are real oyster fans.  Mushroom soup was really excellent, and on-par with auberge du pommier's legendary Cappuccine de Truffe. Here at Biff's, the mushroom soup featured roasted mushrooms that form part of the stock as the hint of smokiness really melds well with the richness of mushroom. Chives and a bit touch of creme fraiche brings the soup a touch of acid and freshness. Well-constructed.  The buf bourguignon was well made. Classically stewed for hours with fantastic sauce to go with.  Creme brulee was excellent with lots of vanilla beans in it, very generous. However, i have to fault them on messing up flambing the top layer. Some of my dinner partners had charred ones, while i had a perfect one, the layer was somewhat thick for my liking and had to use pressure to break apart. A perfect one requires a single tap.  The creme caramel was perfect. Luscious and delicate texture reminding me of tofu with a touch of firmness from the yolks. Minimal number of air bubbles in the dessert is a good indication of a folding techniques when mixing. Officially the best creme caramel in town.  The menu is very extensive, while there's some misses from my dining partners such as a dry duck confit (where Didier and La Palette offers excellent variations!), this is a place with excellent potential with the charming patio and friendly service. Also, it's few minutes walk from home."}
{"text":"Walked by Biff's on a lovely evening and saw the sign out front advertising $! oysters and couldn't resist sitting outside and enjoying a nice cold Kronenbourg and some oysters.  The oysters had a very nice flavour.    We also tried the escargots with gnocchi, bacon and smoked beurre blanc, which were very good, also had the steak tartare, which was good but slightly under-seasoned, at least for my tastes, the braised beef cheek and bone marrow was delicious as was the as was the foie gras du jour, a foie gras parfait with candied peaches.    Service was great, beautiful spot to sit outside, food was very good and the price is quite reasonable.  Will definitely be coming back again soon to try a few more items on the menu that we wanted to try but didn't have room for."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband for drinks and oysters - buck-a-shuck after 5pm on weekends!  Oysters were awesome!  Service was a bit slow - our food came before our drinks....minus that would have been 5 starts!"}
{"text":"was invited to dinner with a high level delegation from Brazil on Nov 13th at 6 pm.  Table of approx 20-25 executives from various industry, government, media etc. .  We were in the private dining room.  Server was good - attentive, but food was very slow, probably because there was only one server for over 20 guests.   The big problem, however, was my steak, which I ordered medium and arrived well done, almost charred.  A major mistake for a so called professional, high level restaurant that purportedly caters to the local business clientele.  The server recognized it and took it back, but the second time around it was not quite right once more arriving medium-rare.  Not wanting to cause further fuss,  I simply ate it and carried on the conversation with my colleagues.  Needless to say, I would not recommend Biffs for any type of business lunch or dinner.  If they can't get a simple steak order right, what else would they screw up?"}
{"text":"Came here for a company dinner and had the great opportunity to try Biff's which is one of the famous Oliver & Bonachini branch. It was a prix fixed meal, but nevertheless, it was a great dining experience for a first time. The atmosphere in there is quite nice. Old photos with nice lighting, not too dark. Dark wooden floor, washroom not so big though.  Started with Hor Dourves (not sure if that's spelled correctly)   Had their $1 oysters I'm certain, and it was fresh indeed, although I did clip a few shells here and there.  Also had their steak tartare on crispy baguette. Nice flavour in the meat, but did not enjoy the crispy baguette where it tasted dry and hard.  Had their cheese puffs. Not bad...   On to the main meal. My gf had their famous mushroom soup with tarragon. She enjoyed it very much. Can really taste good quality mushroom soup that is silky smooth and not overly salty.  I got their roasted red beet salad with goat cheese and maple pecans. Its my first time with beets, so it was alright to me. I'm not a big fan of the flavour, but I am aware its quite healthy for you. Would I order it again if I was a regular guest. Nope!  Mains my gf got the 'Duck Confit' with lentils and this cranberry paste with seeds. First time trying duck confit is surprising tender, fall off the bone deliciousness! When I first saw the plate it seemed quite small, but you peel off the layer of the skin, and the meat is all there waiting for you to scoop it off. Nice dish!  I got the 'Flat Iron Steak' cooked perfectly at medium. Now I am not use to eating flat iron steak, but this steak is quite chewy I find. It took a good few chews to digest in my stomach. Nothing wrong with the steak, but just not use to it.  Desserts we both had their Toffee Date Cake, and it almost looks like bread pudding. This dish was very tasty with the caramel sauce on the side. Overall, the food was quite good and I was glad to get to try this place out..."}
{"text":"Came here while staying downtown for the night. The best part of dinner was the in house distilled water. The food was bland and presentation was blah. Tables are too crowded together, the server wasn't attentive.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"There's so little good French in Toronto so I decided to give Biff's a try. After all, Toronto Life gave it three stars!  The room is attractive and the service was fine if a touch too earnest. I was asked three times how my entree was.  A salad of Boston hearts was near perfect.  Then the beef bourguignon came. This classic had been horribly tampered with. The bulk of the dish was strips of rubbery asian mushrooms that added nothing to the taste. To add insult to injury, they had been laid out in an elaborate crosshatch pattern over the plate that was distinctly unappetizing to gaze on.   Clearly this was a \"creative' chef but I am desperate for a 'competent' one in this town who can execute the basics consistently. I would be loath to come here again and see how other favorites have been ruined.  Every time I go to a restaurant that TL likes I am disappointed, while other places I love get scant notice from them. Flavour just isn't a criteria for them I guess.  I wish I could use this space to recommend another French restaurant in the city but I have not found one I liked! And the last time I went to Manhattan I had two wonderful French meals, just walking into places I happened upon. Toronto can really be a drag sometimes."}
{"text":"Reserved for New Years Eve so our expectations may have been a tad higher, and as expected the prices were also higher. Which we accepted but then the food showed up and we realized that we probably made a bad decision to go to Biffs.  Service: Server did not seem too interested in being there, was not terrible but left us for long periods without checking on food or drinks.  Ambiance: Nice place but lacked friendly environment that we were used to at smaller places.  Really did give off more of a Corporate atmosphere.  Food: Oysters, Beef Wellington, Oysters - not bad, very small portion a little pricey at $16 for tiny oysters  Beef Wellington - I was very much looking forward to this dish and honestly was extremely disappointed. First, there were hardly any seasonal veggies on under the Wellington so the plate presentation looked bare. Next, the tenderloin was way overcooked and nowhere near the medium rare it should have been.  The puff pastry like most Beef Wellingtons can get soggy but I think this was a little more soggy than usual and negatively affected the eating experience.  We were both extremely hungry afterward but we chose not to have the pricey desserts because of Appetizer and Main course experience.  Expectations probably too high perhaps due to New Years but still very disappointing.  Spent over $150 for what seemed like it should have been half that.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place.   The food is excellent. Oysters are a steal at $1 each. And the service, bar none, is the best I've had in the city.   I had Biff's and Carisma listed at my top 2 places, but after the negative experience at Carisma (read my review), Biff's has made it to the top of my list. Yay - you deserve the win, Biff's.   Try it out. Be prepared to drop some money though - things add up, but the food, service, ambiance, everything... believe me, you won't regret it.   Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"I had the Arctic Char with almonds and green beans and I really enjoyed every bite it was delicious! My husband had the Fillet Minon with frites and he said it was one of the best steaks he had ever had.  We also split a salad. The waiter was perfect; attentive but not too fussy, and very nice demeanor. We had a terrific time. The wine selection was great too. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The S.O: Hey, my mum wants to go to Biff's for her birthday. Me: Is that the Frenchy-looking place on Front Street? The S.O: Yeah. Me: OK, let's see what Yelp has to say. **Screech in the record** From the reviews that pre-date mine: \"Subpar food...awful service...\" \"I would not go again.\" Ruh-oh. Based on these reviews, I wouldn't want to eat here. But I wasn't going to be the Yelp nazi who 'jacks an old lady's birthday plans. (At least not this time, anyway.)  But, actually, our experience was not that bad. Biff's is owned by the Oliver Bonacini restaurant group (Canoe, Auberge du Pommier) and I think someone competent went in and cleaned house because both the food and service were better than previously reported.  FOOD The French classics are here, and, yes, they've been tweaked. Sometimes the revamp works; the mushroom soup ($10) was enriched with earthy mushroom flavor instead of heavy cream, the way it would've been in the pre-coronary-awareness 1970s. The chicken liver parfait ($12) was a light, delicious near-foam served with croutons, and tangy cornichons and four-grain mustard, both made in house.  So far, off to a five-star start.  It's when the entrees arrive that the revamping seems more about the chef's conceit than delivering what diners want. Like with New Coke and words like \"hubster,\" why do you mess with the originals if your version isn't a marked improvement?  The S.O.'s boeuf Bourguignon was deconstructed to the point of ridiculousness; chunks of braised beef were served on a plate--a plate, not a bowl!--with dollops of pomme puree and Chinese cloud ear mushrooms with barely any stewing liquid in sight. This is not how Amy Adams made it in the movie, Julie & Julia.  My roasted arctic char ($26) was bland and overcooked, whereas the bed of lentils de Puy it came on were bland and undercooked.  The birthday girl reported that she was happy with her grilled calf's liver ($19). She also loved her dessert, a very rich and dark chocolate torte served with pear puree. Without prompting, the pastry chef scrawled Happy Birthday on the plate. Thankfully, nobody sang.  They have an extensive wine list with prices ranging from moderate to my last paycheck.   SERVICE The hostess, head server, and back-up server all seemed to have graduated from the Professional, Attentive and Slightly Stiff Academy. My favorite, though, was the adorable waiter-in-training wearing a white bellhop jacket who just seemed excited to be there. He didn't mind my silly questions about his jacket and the name of the restaurant. (Biff is Willy Loman's son in Death of a Salesman.)  VIBE Much more classy and formal than how I usually roll but the setting was perfect for the guest of honor. Biff's looks like those grand Parisian brasseries with big mirrors, vintage posters, and cabaret music. Couples, old and young, were dining the night we were there. The space is huge, and I imagine when it's at full swing, Biff's would be buzzy and fun.  BOTTOM LINE A lovely celebration restaurant with an old-fashioned vibe and new-fashioned food. The decor and service will impress dates and mothers.  3 stars"}
{"text":"I'll start with the good; our server was attentive, friendly and helpful.  The food was a bit of a letdown.  The fois gras was tasteless and far to airy.  The duck fettuccine tasted like chicken noodle soup without the broth...not what I expected at all.    For dessert I had the Creme Brulee which was good but not the best I've had.    This is not a place I would recommend nor would I consider going back to."}
{"text":"I went for the Summerlicious menu with some coworkers and I have to say I'm impressed with their menu, service, and how the food tasted overall. A lot of the menu for Summerlicious were pretty boring so this place is a must go in the future if they keep up.  For appetizer it was a seafood salad: great combination of food and the dressing was just wonderful.  For entree the salmon: not much to say about it. It was really good. I believe they butter poached the salmon (I love poached fishes). The veggies were okay. My coworkers seem to really enjoy it and they feature the dish at their entrance. Personally, I found the food too rich in flavour. Wish there was something to cut down the flavour.  Dessert Napoleon: I found it quite average on the taste. Okay, a lil above average. :)"}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5. Good option for winterlicious. Recommend the braised pork shoulder."}
{"text":"Winterlicious Review  Atmosphere/Service : Beautiful decorations, cushy but classic chairs (chaises?) and white or black marble top tables. Soft and rhythmic jazz music plays throughout the night so that you don't have to speak at 1 million decibels to make yourself heard. The crowd is largely suits and older financial types, and the servers are perfectly suited to a composed clientele. Water glasses never went empty.  Food: Some of the dishes looked completely unpresentable, and I was surprised to see that the kitchen let them go out without bettering the presentation. Alas, it was Winterlicious, so I can't complain. Flavours in the soup and grain salad app courses were unsurprising, subtle, and palate pleasing. The mains were beautifully presented and the fish and chicken were absolutely perfectly cooked. Sometimes the flavours were too overpowering to enjoy the texture or natural flavour of the ingredients (e.g. lentil bed for the fish was strongly spiced and I could not taste the typical legume flavours of the lentils).   Desserts were phenomenal. Both the chomeur and bavarois were not overly sweet and the latter had notable tart notes from the cherries. Cheese plate is not recommended: presentation is sub-par, the bread has the texture of sand, and only one of the cheese selections were enjoyable (the cheddar).   I am a big fan of the ambiance and desserts, as well as the service. They carry Rodenbach Grand Cru, which carries a big motivation in my willingness to return in the future, and I most certainly plan on doing so."}
{"text":"Just went today for Winterlicious, and I'm definitely going back for their full menu! Ambience is classy, server is nice and friendly, and most importantly, the food is amazing. They do validate parking, which is very helpful. I would recommend for going on a date as well!"}
{"text":"Was here for dinner Oct 4th.  Was not impressed by the food especially after the person beside me found a live beetle in his salad. Don't remember the menu saying anything about extra protein in the salad. At least the service was good."}
{"text":"I would like to give 3.5 stars but Yelp doesn't allow half points. And I don't round up.  Overall, the service was good except for the one waitress who was completely stupid - we were being attacked by a huge bee and asked for help. She gave the bee a look of disgust and said 'I don't know what to do with a bee!' and ran away. WHAT.THE.FUCK. At least move us to a different table or get us something to swat it away. IDIOT.  Anyhow .. back to food. The tuna appetizer was deliciously cured. I think I could have eaten that as the main. Refreshingly cool. The oysters were 1$ each but were pale in comparison to Celli's Cottage - I would pay a tid bit more and visit the latter instead. The steak frites were an utter disappointment - it was rubbery and tasteless. Honestly, I was arm (steak knife was sawing away at it) and tooth (chomping down on it till my jaw was sore) wrestling with it. The dessert was great tho - it was warm and chocolatey. My companion loved this dessert ... for me tho, I was still dreaming about the Creme Brulee I had at Epic."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5/5  This weekend I had the absolute pleasure of going to Biff's Bistro with some very good friends for some great food and great stories.  This was my last Summerlicious meal for the season, and I was determined to end it with a bang!  Biff's is another Oliver and Bonacini restaurant so once again, my expectations were high.  I started my meal with their house-cured atlantic salmon with mimosa, sauce verte and crème fraiche.  Okay, I'll admit it.  I'm absolutely a sucker for cured meats, especially fish!  Whenever I see it on the menu, I'm immediately drawn to it, and Saturday was no exception.  The salmon had such a great colour and a wonderful salty texture.  It was plump and delicious.  Part of me wished there was more crème fraiche to balance out some of the saltiness, but the dish overall was a treat.  The best part of my meal was that I was with some of my other foodie friends.  It was no question as to whether or not we would also order a serving of freshly shucked oyesters - and at $1 a shuck it was a total win.  It was a nice little treat to accompany our meal.  I know this might be completely inappropriate, but the only thing that I wished was that I had a couple drops of Frank's Red Hot to top it off with.  Sometimes that $#!& goes on everything.  Given the option, I usually order the fish when I go out, but I was drawn to the pork entree simply because I'd never had spätzle before and I really wanted to try it.  The entree consisted of roasted pork tenderloin with Alsatian spätzle, boudin sausage, caramelized apples & calvados.  The pork was wonderfully cooked and flavourful.  A great, hearty piece of meat.  I was a little disappointed with the spätzle.  I obviously don't have a basis for comparison, but I did find it a bit doughy and underseasoned.  For dessert, I ordered the cheese platter.  I don't have an overly sweet tooth, so the cheese was a great alternative with slight sweet contrast in the artisan honey and fruit and nut loaf.  The cheese was nicely aged with a bite at the end.  The combination of the loaf, honey and cheese was just heaven.  The only thing that soured it slighly was that we had to wait a long time inbetween finishing our entree and receiving our dessert.  It wasn't until we were obviously annoyed by the wait did our server come and check on us.  I completely understand that with Summerlicious, restaurants get a rush of people at a time, it would have been nice if our meal could have been wrapped up a little quicker.  I think the best way to determine if a Summerlicious restaurant is good or not is whether you would go back on a regular service night.  I would definitely like to return, because I can tell that Biff's has more up their sleeves in addition to what we ate.  The atmosphere is classy but relaxed, and you're sure to have a great time no matter how big your group is."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy a great night out with fine foods and drinks. Unfortunately the evening we had at Biff's was not as we had hoped. As we read through the menu, our taste buds blossomed and our digestive juices flowed like Pavlov's dog.   We ordered the Plateau de charcuterie (for two), 2 dozen oysters, grilled calf's liver with house cured bacon, grilled romaine, onion soubise, pickled grape and red wine jus.  My husband ordered for himself the beef bourguignon with herb, potato gnocchi, northern wood mushroom and cipollini onion.  We were extremely disappointed with the portion sizes and minimal display on the plates. With the small amount, we had hoped the flavours should wow us, but it was below mediocre. Don't let the price lead you to believe the food should match.  Even the oysters were poorly shucked and under sized. Most of the oysters were still stuck to their half shell and broken during the separation.   The simplistic and most basic expectations we had for the bread basket left us disappointed, they couldn't be bothered to refill it. The Plateau de charcuterie came with a very delicious pâté and 4 shaved (almost transparent) pieces of duck and what appeared to be 4 shaved (thickness of a single strand of hair) summer sausage.  Unfulfilled and disappointed."}
{"text":"You can sit on the patio of Biffs in the summer and imagine you are actually sitting in a bistro in France.  It actually delivers in terms of recreating that feeling.I know because I vacationed in Paris once.  The food was standard for that part of downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"I have been to Biff's a few times mostly for the $1 oysters. I mean no place in town can really beat that. The experiences were mostly pleasant as service and food were both executed extremely well.  Just came back from a dinner for 4 and our focus were oysters oysters and more oysters! We also ordered the the crispy pig ears and rinds, steak tar tar and the bourride.  The last 2 dishes were decent but the crispy pig ears and rinds tasted very blend as if they were not seasoned. Our waitress had very kindly offered to have them redone. However when the dish came back, it was the same old dish with some salt sprinkled over it. I was expecting a newly prepared dish as they would have done in most restaurants.  Regardless, we had a good time and proceeded to order 120 oysters total. The shocker came when the bill was presented to us. The restaurant had charged us $2 for seafood sauce! (I would consider this a condiment especially after just spending $120 on 120 oysters!!!) As well charged us $9.60 for 2 half pints of Kronenbourgs even though we had asked for 1 pint to share ($8). When we asked the waitress for an explanation, she said she can change the beer price but it is restaurant policy to charge for seafood sauce. Then the general manager came back with the modified bill and just WENT ON AND ON AND ON about how they are selling oysters below cost and that's why they are charging for condiments. I told her the point is not the fact that I have a problem paying the extra $2 but the fact that 1) I have never paid for seafood sauce in a restaurant EVER and 2) this should have been brought to our attention when we first asked for the sauce. She then said she would adjust the bill for us and proceed to blame the waitress for not clarifying with us from the start.  I made it clear that I did not want to get the waitress in trouble as she had been a wonderful host for the night but she just went on about how it was the waitress' fault that we were not informed.  Everyone in my party walked away with a very bitter taste in our mouth and all these for $3.60!!!  I was definitely disappointed in the quality of both food and service (how the GM handled this situation) tonight.  I may return to Biff's but it will definitely not be the same."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Great place for lunch on the patio. Love their fish and fresh salads."}
{"text":"Great place......love love love  Great food Great service Great value Enjoyed the whole pre fix menu  Will return in the future"}
{"text":"Last tuesday I went to Biff's Bistro with a few foodie friends to try their Vive Languedoc! menu.   We were greeted with oysters and some refreshing libations inspired in the south of France (bien sur). Pastis with rosemary, sparkling water, and orange slices. Not bad huh?....Besides the fact that I hate Pastis and I am not very fond of rosemary, it was a hit!   I usually do not eat oysters in Toronto but Biff's is usually a reliable source and I have never got sick after eating there. They were delicious!   We had a four course meal paired with wines from the Languedoc region. Just for the record, Languedoc is a former province of France (and I have to admit that I have never set foot in there). The old region is now comprised by the regions of Languedoc-Roussillon and Midi-Pyrénées in the south of France.   If you have never tried wines from the Languedoc region, I would recommend you to try. My favourite was the Crémant de Limoux, but yes, I am bias as I am a huge fan of Champagne and Cava. The sommelier did do a very good job!  Our meal was.... ok. I would love to give you the full menu (with the proper terminology) but I forgot to take a menu with me. The appetizer was a light salad with a beautiful cod and potato gratin with cheese on the top. We had a delicious escargot dish that was my favourite, and pork and fois gras wrapped in pork fat for our main course. The dessert was a creme brulee (too runny to my taste but nice in flavour).  The restaurant was nice as usual, the company was great, the wines were good and so were our food. It did not wow me at all but we had a good time. Would I come back to Biff's? Of course! I love their oysters and their nice atmosphere but I don't think I would go to another event."}
{"text":"Yummy. I love it when a restaurant understands the meaning of 'rare'.  It's not medium rare or kind of rare - its passed over th heat just long enough for the outside to almost sear and barely warm up the middle.   I like Biff's a lot because they served my filet truly rare. Plus they produced a veg side rife with oils and butter that was almost as tasty as the steak. The wine list is not so great - for whatever reasons, that's been my Canadian experience from Vancouver to Ottawa (Montreal and Quebec City do much better) but that's just to be expected - I'm resigned. I will go to Biff's again."}
{"text":"Went here with my Ex during the summer, it was really suprising to think it was a bistro, since the name was theoretically saying it was what it was. Thier food quality is great, prepared hot an nice food plating which brought out what it's worth. The grease on certain plates such as their stake could've been less messy due to the liquid basing the steak was possibly in but that is just a personal preference since I or some prefer clean an orianted.  3/5 Waitering 4/5 Food Service 4/5Location 4/5 Quality Great place to get to know one another with a date."}
{"text":"I used to love this place so much! My last visit there wasn't as exciting as the ones before, and I found the food a bit generic and the service was a bit slow.  Still if you're a fan of French cuisine (like I am!) you've got to try this place. I personally recommend beef tar tar ( if you're into raw) or fillet minion (if you're not)."}
{"text":"I've been to biff's couple times, and I feel like it has changed. It's not the same bistro that I enjoyed couple years ago anymore!  Too bad to see some amazing dishes disappear from the menu, and I feel like the overall quality of the food has dropped a bit. Not bad or anything, but nothing extraordinary either.  The atmosphere is still very nice, but just sad to see that it has changed for the worse, basically."}
{"text":"3 stars might be a little too critical but I've eaten at Biffs many times and it is never a perfect experience. The food is good, not great. The oysters are a plus but aren't always fully shucked. The blood pudding was great but I don't think that is a regular item. Every time I go the staff seem to disappear for long periods of time."}
{"text":"I was there for lunch with couple of my colleagues. I had the tuna tartare...it was just ok. Wasn't very flavorful. Waitress was nice but service was a bit slow. I would be more understanding if the restaurant was busy but it wasn't."}
{"text":"We went here mostly because of the location and the fact that they have $1 oysters. The service was absolutely terrible.  Don't even come here for just oysters as they make it impossible.  You are only allowed to order 24 at a time and we were a party of 4 planning on just eating oysters. They took 30 minutes to bring one platter and would not let you order anymore until they were served. So ended up ordering steak frites and fish which was not great. The $1 a shuck oysters is just intended to get you in there.   We will NOT be returning.  Lots of other great places to order oysters at."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed both my visits here. They have a $35 set menu that's delicious. For the set menu, I had the beef bourguignon and the romaine salad. I was shockingly delighted by the salad. I thought it was a simple caesar salad but there was a tanginess to it. When I read it, it turned out to be something else (cannot recall), but even my friend who hates anything cheesy or creamy thought the salad dressing was well done. The fried onion was a nice touch as well. I really liked the beef. It was really tender, and although it was not in the traditional beef stew form, I enjoyed eating it with the gnocchi. I also had the duck, which was on the regular menu. It was very good, cooked medium rare, perfectly, and seasoned well (asian food is very flavourful and so I do like my food on the well-seasoned, salty end). My friend had a special the second time I went, it was parpadelle with beef tenderloin, I believe. The parpadelle was made in-house and was amazing. The beef was good as well, overall a very good dish.  Some problems my party faced was with the chicken and fish. The chicken was a tad pink inside, but the waiter explained to us that it was cooked a certain way that leaves the colour so. He assured us that the chicken was cooked. I tried it, and it was certainly cooked, but the colour definitely bothered my friend, who has a sensitive stomach and was worrying about her stomach the rest of the night. The fish I tried was a bit overcooked on the inside, but seasoned well. It came with little bits of duck confit, and so it was a bit too rich for my cousin's taste. Besides the sorbet, which is really good, the dessert was mediocre, which was a disappointing.   The service was good both times and I will be going again.  P.S. They have $1 oysters after 5 p.m. I believe. Not the best oysters, but a good deal for oyster lovers."}
{"text":"10 people on a  Tuesday night. Food: Several of us got steak -- tough to cut (even with steak knife) and not the least bit tender. Two of us had meat way undercooked relative to our order. Fries were excellent as was goat cheese salad. Service: Slow and the place was not busy. Inattentive and server seemed to be hovering around folks when obviously in the middle of a conversation. Atmosphere: Nice place however music was loud and distracting (we sat up in front section)."}
{"text":"One of my favorites, and much better than the O&B next door. There is something about french cooking that warms the soul on a cold winter day. As soon as the frost hits in November I start hankering for cheese fondue and boeuf bourguignon.   This place can be a bit pricey for everyday dining, but for a datenight you can get a really great meal for a reasonable price --so long as you dont get carried away with the wine list!   The service is always good. I prefer to sit on the bar side, but have done the dining room experience as well. If you ask for a wine pairing, your server can either help you, or will send someone with somalier skillz your way. They bring out warm bread, and I am kindof obsessed with their pickles and grainy dijon. Mmmm. The bourguignon was a bit of a different take than the way I make it, but topped with gruyere cheese? Yes please! I think the only thing I have had here that I did not love was when we did the prix fixe dinner one night and I ordered the creme caramel for dessert. I was underwhelmed by the taste and texture. There was nothing really wrong with it, it just lacked lustre --especially after the spectacular meal we'd had.   I would heartily recommend this one for sure!"}
{"text":"Even though French Cuisine isn't my favourite, I enjoyed my experience here.  The ambiance is great with such attentive & knowledgable servers.  I had the prix fixe with the Duck confit.  First time trying duck so I was a bit nervous but it was very tender and cooked well.  The only thing is that it was a bit on the salty side.  The cassis panna cotta for dessert was perfect for cleansing my palate as well.  Oh, I also had a bite of my friend' steak tartar.. it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Restaurant: Biff's Cuisine: French/Bistro Location: Entertainment District Address: 4 Front St E Price Range: $15-25  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3 Service: 5  Ambiance: 4 Overall: 4  Extra information:  *$1 oysters after 5 *Patio during the Summer time  Biff's is a beautiful French/Bistro restaurant located on Front St E. Ever since coming to Toronto, I've been craving fresh oysters that's so easy to find in BC (westcoast) for a decent price. One day I was complaining about how oysters are so expensive in Toronto, when my friends told me about the $1 oyster deals at Biff's.  So after having dinner at Frog & Firkin, we decided to drop by biff's for some oysters!   It's dark inside the restaurant but not so dark that you need to use your iphone to read the menu. Once we stepped inside, the host guided us to the bar area when we told them we were there for oyster specials. Biff's is def one of the fancier restaurants around the block, but it has an overall laid back atmosphere. So it wouldn't necessarily make you feel out of place if you were dressed casually.  Our waiter was friendly and provided us with excellent service. He kindly explained some of the cocktails to us and he was very knowledgeable about their menu.  Ordered: Heart Warmer Cocktail 4/5  *Cocktail made with pomegranate vodka and red grapefruit for $9.50 *Drink is sweet and perfect for girls *Refreshing with strong grapefruit juice after-taste *Didn't taste/feel like it had much alcohol in it  Since we were there for oyster specials, we started off with ordering 20 oysters for 3 of us.  Ordered: Oysters 3/5  *The oyster took a while to arrive, but I assume it's because they shuck it when you order them so it comes fresh. *It came with fresh horseradish, red wine vinegar and lemon. *Oyster were quite small but they were very fresh- however, they didn't really have much flavor *It almost tasted like I was slurping water *I personally prefer more sauce/condiments that are provided at Rodney's Oysters (Worcester and hot sauce) *They were decent for the price but it wasn't the best oysters I've had  One of the friends I went with insisted we order the frog legs at biffs. I've never had frog legs before nor did my other friend...but what the heck, we decided to give it a try.   Ordered: Frog's Legs with Sauce Gribiche 2/5  *I wasn't sure what to expect but it came lightly deep fried with some type of tartar sauce. *And yes...it sure looked like frog legs. *You know how people say frogs taste like chicken? well, it does *The texture was almost like soft chicken meat, which wasn't very appetizing. *The fact that I was eating frog legs didn't creep me out at all, but the taste and the texture just did not appeal to me. *To be honest, I was expecting to be more firm. My friend told me how usually they do it better and how this dish wasn't done right... *This did it for me, I tried frogs once and I am not really interested in trying it again. *What can you say, first experience is really important!  Summary: Although I didn't really enjoy the food at biffs, I really enjoyed my experience there. The restaurant has a nice, relaxing vibe and everyone who worked there was super friendly. I would like to go back and try their regular dinner items. This place would be good for girls night out or a date night."}
{"text":"I would never recommend this place. I was extremly disappointed by  overpriced and tasteless food. Poor service."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Biff's for NYE.  We are from out of town and made a reservation last minute.  The food was decent, however the atmosphere was lacking. My wife and I are in our early 30's and the average age there was in the 60's and above.  Nothing wrong with that but if you are hoping for a more hip place for a night out on the town this is not the place.    To make things worse, an older gentleman made a disparaging remark to my wife about being dressed inappropriately which was strange since she was wearing a nice sweater and jeans.  We mentioned it to the front staff but all they offered were apologetic smiles.  I believe he was a regular b/c the hostess seemed to recognize him.  We had the set menu.  The oyster appetizer and soup were delicious.  The main dish was just ok. (Braised Pork)  I'll probably not come back, the clientele are a big turn off and there are so many other wonderful restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Dropped in to have a quick bite before the So You Think You Can Dance show across the street at happening at 7:30 in the evening. We arrived at around 6pm, and got seated at the bar as everything else was either occupied or reserved. Our orders went in at 6:11pm according to the receipt.   We ordered a dozen of the $1 oysters (we came here just for this), 2 mushroom soups and a goat cheese salad. The soups arrived at 6:40, about half an hour after we ordered. At about 7 the gentleman next to us asked the bartender to check on his order; he had been waiting for an hour. The lady next to us mentioned that her oysters took an hour to arrive also.  Finally our salad came at 7:05, and it wasn't that good.  At about 7:10 we decided to mention to the bartender that we had a show to catch, and she started to get the bill until I reminded her that our oysters hadn't arrived yet. She apologized profusely and went to the kitchen to check for us.  Five minutes later the oysters came and I rushed to gulp them down and pay the bill. Then I realized I only got 10 of the dozen that I ordered, and had to get the bill adjusted.   I don't fault the bartender too much as it was the kitchen's fault, but the speed of service was atrocious and the food was overpriced for what you get ($10 for a soup and $15 for a tiny salad with no meat), aside from the oysters.  If I hadn't told to server we had a time constraint who knows how much longer we would have had to wait?"}
{"text":"Second time here and as usual, the food was delicious. We primarily came for the buck a shuck oysters, which has a countdown from 700, but we wonder about the actual legitimacy of the countdown as we had 72 oysters but the numbers on the board didn't seem to reflect that.   In any case, the other reason we were there was to celebrate a friend's birthday. Sadly, just like the first time I was at Biff's, despite a clear conversation with the hostess/server about doing something for the birthday boy/girl, and assuring me they would put a candle in the dessert and write happy birthday, this did not happen - TWICE!!! This was super frustrating and the server clearly had no recollection of this at all even though we had even made sure he knew who the birthday boy was at the table.   So as long as you aren't there for a birthday (although there were a few around me that were successes), go there for the oysters and other fabulous French cuisine. I got the 3 course meal since I don't eat raw oysters which did not disappoint - especially the chicken liver parfait. Mmmm. Also, the service is on the slow side so don't go if you are in a rush!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, and atmosphere. The ribs are to die for!"}
{"text":"Biff's Bistro is nice and pricey for dinner.  We went for Winterlicious Dinner and it was just okay.  But the service was excellent that I would probably go back again.  Plus, I reallly want to try their oysters!  The atmosphere is pretty nice, but our table for two was too close to the table for two behind us.  I don't think it's meant for two women with winter coats to be sitting back to back without hitting each.  We ended up pulling our table over since there was no other table on one side of us.  Ther server was cute! (Too bad neither my friend nor I am single!  I'm just kidding... kinda..) The service was very good from the very start.  The host greeted us promptly and we were seated very quickly even without reservations.  We ended up taking our time after our meal to eat our desserts and then even after that we stayed to chat a while longer.  They never tried to kick us out (thank goodness it wasn't a busy night) and they still served us water time and time again.  The food was okay, but I thought it was a little on the pricey side even with the Winterlicious menu pricing.  The breat there is very good!  We ended up getting 2 more refills.  The portion size of the appetizer is good, but I found the portion size of the entrée was a little small.  The dessert was delicious and a good size.  All in all it was a good night out."}
{"text":"My company had a group dinner at Biff's Bistro two nights in a row ... that means it can't be bad right?   Food: Good  Ambiance: We were in a private room and that was great  Service: GREAT  Location: Convenient  Value: Never saw the bill so I'm not sure   I'm not sure why my company (from the US) chose this restaurant but I'm assuming because of its proximity to both the convention centre and our hotel (the Sheraton Centre). We had a private room where we would be holding a presentation and the details to support that were flawlessly executed. we had a large table that seated 15, a projection screen, and a couple of devoted waiters.   Let me just say that the service was great. Top notch. We were waited on attentively and the dinner/room/meal had a nice upscale feel.   The menu is French which isn't at the top of my list (being a cheese hater) but I was easily able to find items on the menu that I liked. I had some of the tuna appetizers, a beet salad, and a steak.   I quickly passed on the lamb liver appetizer and blood marrow pudding. (Um EWE!??!) Maybe its a Canadian thing but both seemed unappealing to my American palate.   For desert we all had small slices of chocolate cake. There was only one empty dish left on the table!   The food here is good, and the service is great. Both make this place worth checking out if you are looking for a restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"This place blew my mind. Frog legs we're awesome and dollar oysters after 5, bangin food all around. Def make sure you wait til dinner time because the lunch menu is tiny and pales in comparison to the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Biff's is right in my neighborhood.  It's a cute little french bistro (operating under O&B) that serves up classic French (and sometimes French-Canadian) Cuisine with a few modern twists here and there.  In the summer months the patio is a beautiful place to sip on some wine, have some oysters or even a full meal.  The furniture is comfortable and the flowers and iron fence add to the Parisian feel.    What's also fun about Biff's is that they do a daily froie gras special which changes every day based on the chef's inspiration.  It's always new a refreshing to try what they have to offer for the day and what flavour pairings they've chosen to serve up.  Everything else on the menu is executed well too.  While Biff's may not be that trend setting droll over french resto option in Toronto, it serves as a solid choice if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Before seeing the Pet Shop Boys Supertour (which was, by the way, FANTASTIC), we decided to do dinner right across the Sony Center. I felt like French food, so Biff's fit the bill for that type of cuisine and with a great ambiance to match.   Service is really good here. Like really good in the very attentive, but not overbearing kind. Food, on the other hand, is so-so.  My dad said everything was just overly salty - the frog leg appetizer, the fois gras, his Beef Borguignon. The mushroom soup was the same one you get at O&B so nothing different there. My Quenelle basically was bread.  My mom, on the other hand, really enjoyed her Duck Confit and my husband had a very nice, tender piece of steak.  The Lemon Tart was nice and refreshing and the Madelines...well, nothing can ever compare to those from Café Boulud.  Would I come back here again? Don't think so...unless it's for drinks (Sunday is half-priced bottle of wines!!) and nibbles. But the overall ambiance and the service were great."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and service. Good for a fancy date or a special occasion. Oysters were excellent and I don't even like seafood. 3 course meal for $35 felt like great value with mushroom soup, beef bourguignon and lemon cake."}
{"text":"To be honest this restaurant does not deserve even one star. I don't even have words to describe such terrible food - foei gras with greasy french fries totally killed me !!! The linguine was extremely overcooked and tasteless, however our server haven't even tried to figure out why we didnt  touch our food. This place is not worth to spend your money and time!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of French bistro fare, so was thrilled to find out Oliver & Bonacini had launched Biff's. The food was excellent (as expected: gorgeous duck confit), the wine selection very broad and the staff is superb. The one failing point I found was the decor, which did not present so much as authentic French, but as a chain restaurant version of French. There were some very lacklustre and cliched art choices, an overall lack of warmth and no sense of the history or patina which would have amounted to a very romantic bistro experience. Keep the herringbone floors and the lovely zinc bar, but add a few more layers."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend and had their amazing 18 one dollar oyster with the beet cured salmon salad. Although the salad was small portion, it was delicious and more meaty than veggie. The chocolate marquise was a great and rich in chocolate (a type of flourless cake that's sort of like a brownie). Overall, I would definitely come back to try their regular menu (I had a craving for oysters and couldn't resist their special)."}
{"text":"I should start off by saying that in general, I am not a fan of O&B restaurants - I find them to be overhyped, and often overpriced for what they are.   I did however, receive a gift card to the O&B empire and decided on Biffs as I had never been there before. I will just talk about food and service (ambience, decor etc were all fine).  Food  We took advantage of the buck a shuck oysters - fresh, shucked perfectly - no complaints. Great price without it being bargain oysters  The crispy pig ears were out but our server suggested the chicken liver parfait. It was delicious and they gave you a very generous portion of pate - lets just say we had over half remaining! Very smooth, delicate flavour  My boyfriend got the prix fixe - mushroom soup and braised ribs, whereas I just got the steak frites. The mushroom soup was delicious, light, full of flavour. The braised ribs were good but nothing spectacular. I make similar ones and I thought they were similar tasting (and I am not a great cook by any stretch of the imagination). My steak was overcooked and just meh - honestly the keg does a better steak.  Service  Our server was excellent. He was busy so forgot to come back to check if I wanted wine (in all fairness I was waffling) but there were plenty of other people checking in on us. The people who served us the food didn't explain it (say that the pate comes with house made mustard!) but it didn't dampen our experience.  Overall; its fine, not great. For the price (around $150) I would prefer other places in the city with more spectacular food. I'd come back for the oysters but would have dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"A-OK because I'm not a fan of the food....BUT  They do $1 oysters DAILY after 5 pm. Need I say more?  Be warned it can hit or miss as they serve whatever they get from their wholesalers that day. Call ahead if you're picky.  But if you're an easy-to-please oyster fiend like me...really, how are you going to say no to a buck a shuck?"}
{"text":"I always wanted to go to Biff, and I grabbed onto the opportunity when Summerliscious rolled around. Let me start with the decor: it's cozy but very fancy at the same time. My friends and I tried their $1 oysters - they are so good for the price. From the menu, I tried the Salmon Tartare (appetizer), Beef Steak Diane (entree), Chocolate Bavarois (dessert). My friends tried the appetizers: Chilled Cucumber Soup, St-Canut Jambon de Paris; entree:Poached Salmon, Chicken Au Pistou; and desserts: Un Bordel de Fraises, and Biff's Summerlicious Cheese.   I really enjoyed all the menu items. The steak was a little more cooked than I wanted for Medium Rare - but it was still delicious. One of my friends chicken was a little under cooked around the bone. For the desserts: I absolutely loved the Un Bordel de Fraises. It was sweet and sour - a wonderful combination. I didn't get that of course, but my own Chocolate Bavarois was still good - not too sweet and texture was perfect. However, I just preferred the Bordel de Fraises more.  Overall this meal was well worth the cost. My next item to try is the Steak Tartare - I've heard many good things from friends. So I'll see you again, Biff!"}
{"text":"We ended up here on a Sunday as it was sorta farewell for my friend. We started out with 2 dozen oysters (buck a shuck so can't go wrong there). The icing on the cake was that they have no corkage on Sundays. I had brought a nice bottle of Zinfandel from my last trip to Napa and was saving it for a memorable occasion and this seemed appropriate enough. The oysters came on nice bed of ice with accompaniments. This course went well. Feeling I would need more than just a main I ordered ROASTED BONE MARROW PUDDING and Steak and Frites. My friend had the 35 day aged rib eye.  The marrow was good and reminded me of the good days when Hoof Cafe was open and used to serve something similar. As for the mains for a bistro I don't think it was anything special. The fries were nice but the my main steak was nothing special. Same goes for the 35 days aged rib eye. I guess I have been spoiled by  grilling my own steaks all summer long and really expect  a very good steak to make it memorable. The wine went well and the total damage without tips around 100 bucks. I mean we didn't have anything spectacular which seems to be the theme for most of O&B mid range establishments which have been relegated to mediocrity . 3 Stars due the good value on oysters and no corkage fee on Sundays :) I think O&B needs to improve the food in their mid range places (they are not mid range anymore for starters!)."}
{"text":"We came here on the last day of Winterlicious 2017.  I made a reservation, last minute after reading Danny's review for last year's Winterlicious.  It was a good decision.  Thanks to Danny.  The whole experience was great.   Good Food. Great Ambiance. Excellent Service.  Let's start!  Service  Reservation: It is always a good idea to make a reservation because you never know when a restaurant will get busy. You can either call or book a table thru their website.  I  called only the night before to reserve a table for  two people on the last day of  Winterlicious 2017.  The person who took my phone call greeted me very well in French .  He was polite and informative.  He took time to explain about the restaurant's reservation policy such as how long the restaurant could hold the table for us and what we needed to do if we changed our mind or we couldn't make it on time.  It was simple rules that many restaurants use, such as  the reservation would be held only for 15 minutes and if there's any changes, the customer needs to call to inform them ahead of time for an hour in order to adjust the time and they will accommodate the customer at the best.  However, it wasn't a problem for us.  We arrived there before the reservation time about 10-15 minutes.   Host: The hostess suggested to wait at the bar while she was having our table prepared.  It didn't take longer than 5-10 minutes.  My husband just ordered a double shot of whiskey  and didn't even touch it yet. The hostess had to wait for us to make a payment for the drink.  She waited there with us patiently and brought us to our table.  Waiter: After sitting down for 5-10 minutes, our server \"Allen F\" came to introduce himself and greet us. He was polite, helpful and attentive.   Ambiance  The restaurant is decorated in a modern way.  They have a bar section on the right side which customers can use as a waiting room.  The dinning room is on the left side of the hallway.    Food   We got a prix fixe dinner menu of the Winterlicious 2017.  It was $38 per person for 3 courses.  You can also add wine pairings with your food.  The price was very good.  $25 for petit (11oz.) and $28 for grande (14oz.).  I ordered only a glass of wine while my husband got wine pairings with his food.   Appetizer  - Lemon Parsley Cod Cake: It was juicy and not too greasy. It was pretty good.    - Spiced Chicken Pastilla Parcel: It was delicious .  They just look like Thai Chicken Curry Puffs. The parcels were wrapped in a triangular shape and served with BARISSA YOGURT dip and SUMAC.  The pastry was CRUNCHY and GOLDEN brown.  The chicken filling was very FLAVOURFUL and SPICY! The Pastilla pastry is a bit thinner than Thai curry puff pastry however they both are crispy and perfect for SNACK and LUNCH!  These Pastilla Parcels also went very well with the paring wine \"2015 Grüner Veltliner, Loimer 'Langenlois', Kamptal, AT\". My husband normally doesn't like white wine because they mostly are too sweet for him. However, this paring white wine was great and paired well with spicy pastillas.    Entree  - Pan Roasted Salmon: The salmon itself was cooked perfectly. Salmon skin was the best part. It was very crispy  I normally don't like salmon skin but I couldn't deny it this time. Their CAULIFLOWER COUSCOUS was very good.  It went well with BLACK TRUFFLE VINAIGRETTE.  Really love  ! .   - Steak: My husband chose STEAK for his main dish. I actually didn't touch it except potatoes on the dish . I don't eat beef. I can't explain how steak was . Based on his opinion, the steak was a bit tough to chew.  It was an ok dish.  The presentation was good .  Potatoes were tasty.  However, he said he was more interested in my salmon dish .  He liked his paring wine though.  It was \"2012 Gabbiano 'Solatio', Toscana, IT .\"     Dessert  - Camembert en croute:  This was my first time to experience Camembert en croute. It was a remarkable dessert.  It was soft and very rich in cheese .    Must try it! We had it with the sparkling red wine, \"N.V. Brachetto d Acqui, Viticoltori Acquesi Sparkling from Italy .\"  - Chocolate cake:  It was a bit hard. It seemed like it was sitting on a plate for a long time.  It might be better if they could warm it up before serving.  I'd prefer my cake to be soft and puffy~   Price: $$$  OVERALL was GREAT"}
{"text":"I went to Biff's a few weeks ago because I was craving something French. The restaurant is nice and the servers are great.  We also enjoyed the oyster special ($1 per oyster and upto 40 orders per table! Can't beat this price and the oysters were delicious / fresh!)  Although I've enjoyed the oysters and the service, I didn't think everything else we ordered was very good. The price is reasonable but that shouldn't be a reflection on how average the food is going to taste.  I had the roasted pork belly and my boyfriend had the filet mignon. Both were average. For dessert, we ordered the basket of madelaines which I LOVE because they are soft, chewy and buttery. Well theirs was GINGERY. Who (and why) spices this classic simple delicious treat with GINGER? They were well baked and served fresh out of the oven but I was surprisingly disappointed with the odd ginger scent and taste with this dessert.  Overall, the place makes a decent attempt at being a quality restaurant and offering some classic french items but fell short for me."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe how this place has changed, and not for the better!    I called last week to get some more details about the launch of their new \"Dirty Bits\" menu along with the farewell of their daily one dollar oyster specials.  (They now have daily specials but buck a shuck oysters on Tuesdays and Saturdays).  So it was advertised as an Oyster Shuck-Off, with different chefs doing the shucking at different oyster stations.  On the phone, I was told there would be four stations with four types of oysters, from both east and west coasts.  It sounded like a casual event where you would pay at the stations, get your oysters, have a few drinks and sample some of the new \"bits\".  It sounded like a fun launch!  This was not the case, by any means.    1. There was only one type of oyster (Cascumpec Bay, P.E.I.).  That in itself was a disappointment.   2. We sampled some extremely watered down cocktails and some really strong ones too.  The inconsistency was terrible.  Some would say I can't complain about complimentary drinks, but if that's any indication of what you'll be serving me when I pay, then I thank you.  3. I asked a server what was in a particular drink and she had no idea.  She said she would find out but she didn't.  This is a so-called \"launch\".  Shouldn't all the servers know the menu inside and out?  4. We sampled a few food items but it seemed as though the food would go one way and the drinks the other.  There was no balance.  Some patrons would get all the food, we happened to get most of the drinks.  This made no sense at all.    Again, if you're showcasing a new menu, it would be to your benefit to put your best foot forward.  Instead, it was an unimpressive kick-off to a boring \"new\" menu.    Oh right, to top it all off, I found a really cool looking organism living in my oyster.  I wish I took a video but it was replaced before I had a chance.  Good thing I showed it off to several people.  It was ALIVE and swimming in the seawater.  I guess that's as fresh as it gets?"}
{"text":"I was here for my birthday and the service was wonderful.   My guests and I were seated in a private room decked with artwork mapping out streets in Paris. Great conversation starter.  The menu had a varied selection and I had the Beef Bourguignon with truffled Parisienne gnocchi, mushrooms & bacon... I would definitely have it again and the meal was also accompanied by pickles and house mustard which were perfect during dinner. My friends tried the chicken dishes and had rave reviews. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the items.   Very nice place and hopefully, I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Went before a show at the Sony centre.  Nice restaurant but I couldn't do more than 3 stars for the following reasons.   - Oysters were poorly shucked and extremely small (even for small oysters)   - Beer was flat  - Mains came out before we were finished our oysters,  even tho we asked that they hold off.    - I had the calf liver which was great but problem was there was 2 pieces,  with one being cooked perfectly while second piece was way less cooked.  Not sure how the chef managed that.   Overall not up to the standards you would expect from a OB restaurant."}
{"text":"(4.5*)  We loved our waiter so much that my friend would chug her glass of water so he could come back and refill her glass hahah. Our waiter asked every time our dish came out how everything tasted and if everything was okay and made sure to keep our glasses of water always full. Very good and friendly service here I love it.  We came here for Winterlicious and ordered Cervelle De Canut, Truite Au Bleu, Roasted Turkey & Canestri Pasta, Lemon Parsely Cod Cakes, Camembert en Croûte, and Molten Chocolate Cake.  Cervelle De Canut (2.5/5) There was so much whipped cheese lol the greens were drowning in it. Fortunately the cheese wasn't too strong or overpowering so I didn't really mind. You could kinda taste the pickled beet vinegrette but I would've liked more especially with the amount of whipped cheese was on there. The vegetables weren't as crisp as I'd like.  Truite Au Bleu (3/5) There were 2 crisps and slow cooked trout on each and the sauce was lovely. However the trout was a bit fishy? So it kinda off put me a little.  Roasted Turkey & Canestri Pasta (4.5/5) The sweetness from the sauce really shows that it was from the Madeira wine that they used and the turkey was cooked to perfection. I also loved the aroma of the gremolata, but I would've preferred the pasta to be a little less sweet because I was starting to get sick of eating it with how sweet it was.  Lemon Parsely Cod Cakes (5/5) I really hate parsely but I decided to order this dish anyways and surprisingly enough, there wasn't enough parsely taste for me to hate it. The Cod Cakes were actually really smooth and creamy and the crisp on the outside was on point. I loved the gribiche sauce and lovely carrots paired with it.   Camembert En Croûte (5/5) The aroma from the Thyme Honey Butter was so fragrant it made it a really nice dessert to end off with after the Cod Cakes. It did say raspberry but I got sliced strawberries instead? The camembert was mush, the strawberries were soft, the apple slices weren't as crunchy as I'd like, but the nuts (i think) sprinkled ontop made the texture of the entire dish exquisite. There was also a Husked Cherry Tomato garnish in my dish and the tartness it had gave me a very refreshing palate cleanser to enjoy finishing dessert more.  Molten Chocolate Cake (5/5) This cake was the softest melting fudgey cake you could ask for and it's bittersweetness made it really enjoalso had the husked cherry tomato and toasted oat crumble to accentuate the soft cake.  Really nice experience thank you for having us :)"}
{"text":"This is by far, one of the greatest restaurants in downtown GTA. I walked in, and was waited on by a group of very friendly staff who were extremely knowledgeable about every dish: the ingredients, preparation, etc.   I ended up ordering the duck confit with a broccoli purée and cabbage mix underneath, which was absolutely delicious. It costed around $30+taxes, but it was also quite a large serving.   10/10 would go back again."}
{"text":"High-quality restaurant in every respect. An Oliver and Bonacini classic.  Vegetable and goat's cheese mousse was a fresh surprise;  Smelts were not cold and greasy as they often are, but hot and crisp.  The tuna was firm and of sashimi quality with fish roe and anis.  The flatiron steak was thick, with flavour and accompanied by great French fries.  We had freshly cooked Madeleine's, which are worthwhile and unusual. Fine wine list."}
{"text":"Location: 4 Front Street  E, Toronto, ON M5E 1G4 Price: $$$ Service: alright   The best thing about this \"fancy\" restaurant was the $1 oysters! Prior to this outing I have never tried oysters and I was glad I did. My friends told me that it was rare to have $1 oysters at restaurants in Toronto but at the same time this restaurant's oysters aren't as rich since it's from PEI (fresh but not the best) Of course it was delicious but of you're a oyster enthusiast you wouldn't be amaze by the taste but only the price.   I really did enjoy my visit at this Bristo. Everything from their duck to seafood to steak tar tar was well done. It wasn't amazing to be a 5 star rating. However, the service was good and a restaurant with great service is a must visit.   Verdict: $1 oysters for the win!"}
{"text":"It's nice if you want to feel very fancy and important but the food was expensive and the wine was ridiculous.  It was good-but I'd rather spend that money on about 5 dinners at another restaurant.   Dress nicely, though.  The staff is nice.  The photos on the wall look really nice and there's a lovely patio. The location is awesome, too.   That's the only really particularly good part of the experience.   Nothing bad per se, but just nothing great."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!! And I'm a very picky eater.   However, I don't think they take instructions well. I didn't want Brussel sprouts and specifically told them not to include it. Only for my meal to arrive and what did I see? Brussel Sprouts.   This was my first time eating there though so I'm going to give it another try next time. I keep you updated.   P.S The drinks(cocktails) are superb"}
{"text":"Dined at Biff's in a party of 10 about a week ago. Atmosphere was lovely, and the staff were extremely attentive, which considering I was the fashionably late last to arrive, was a pleasant surprise.   I enjoyed the steak frites, and the staff were happy to amend things to cater to specific dietary restrictions. Steak was perfectly cooked, and the side of veggies were served with a garnish that I'd guess was a parsley puree of some kind that was out of this world. I'm not really sure if I've guessed right at parsley, but whatever it was, I loved it.  Ambiance was upscale casual and enjoyable. I saw many other options on the menu that I'd be interested in trying again sometime."}
{"text":"Lunched during winterlicious with great disappointment.  absolutely embarrassed to take a business associate there!  the food 1 out of 5....it took repeated requests to even get my water glass filled. my lunch date could not believe the slow service. she had to leave before even ordering her prix fixed dessert. sloppy management. poor Training.   only redeeming quality? a smile, most of the time after you spend 2 1/2 hours requesting service.  stay away if you want to enjoy lunch. dinners years ago where amazing. who runs this now \"so so joint?\" that of course rhetorical...non? O & B....you so have dropped the Ball!"}
{"text":"Oliver & Bonacini - you've no doubt heard the name. They own 8 restaurants in the downtown core alone and attract the corporate crowd like moths to a flame. They're also home to one of the hardest-to-get reservations (at Canoe) during Summerlicious and Winterlicious. Yeah, you just keep your finger on the redial button honey.  I was never a die-hard fan of the O&B empire simply because I didn't have a corporate expense account and always found the crowd to be \"stuffy.\" None of their restaurants were places I would go to hang out with friends. Most of my dining experience were Summer/Winterlicious luncheons with fellow co-workers or for special occasions.  But most recently I've been spending a lot of time après work at the bar of Biff's Bistro at Yonge/Front because of the recent launch of their Ménage à Trois, Quatre, Cinq menu where you can enjoy two Sustain wines (a red and a white) from Rosehall Run Winery from Prince Edward County and Mill Street Organic on tap for $3, $4, and $5 respectively from 3-5pm, along with a daily bar snack special from Monday to Fridays for the same prices. The daily snack features are as follows:  Mondays: Vegetarian Tuesdays: Meat Wednesdays: Pork Thursdays: Vegetarian Fridays: Fish  And if you just so happen to have one of those jobs that don't allow you to clock out before 5pm, you can still take advantage of the buck-a-shuck from 5pm onwards. On weekdays they start the countdown with 500 oysters until they sell-out and 700 on weekends.  On the particular Sunday I went, they were serving Read (pronounced reed) Island Gems from British Columbia which were really creamy and delicious!  They might just be my new go-to West Coast shuck!  One evening I was flying solo but still had a blast. The crowd is very diverse from nearby theatre-goers to out-of-towners and yes the corporate crowd undoubtedly still find their way in but the atmosphere is fun and inviting. When the weather cooperates, the patio is a great spot to get al fresco with a view of the Sony Centre of Performing Arts through colourful planters and iron gates. It's a great spot to play \"fashion police\" at the expense of show go-ers and have a good laugh.  Parking is also $2 after 5:30p.m.  There are cocktails too of course, but I found mine too syrupy and sweet.  Cocktails everywhere are always a hit and miss; but wine and beer seldom let you down.  I am quite infatuated with Amanda Ray's menu at the moment with everything from escargots with gnocchi à la parisienne (pictured above) to crispy pig's ears (pictured below) and a bavarois for dessert.  She's recently done some travelling in Vietnam and on one night featured what I'd call a \"fish lettuce wrap\" that was inspired from ch cá lã vng, a turmeric and dill fish dish originating from Hanoi. It's nice to see her incorporating dishes from bygone French colonies as well. My mom would've loved it! (Random tidbit: She was born and raised in Vietnam and so I've been exposed to that cuisine since a very young age).  It is also worth noting that they have their regular prix fixe menu for $34.95 that includes an appetizer, main and dessert. For that price - you can't really go wrong. The selection isn't just a sloppily thrown together menu of \"cheap\" offerings either. Chicken liver parfait and buf bourgignon are just some of the decadent offerings with a gâteau de citron that won't make you feel too guilty to indulge in something sweet.  So allez-y, make a reservation at Biff's Bistro.  There's no word on how long the Ménage à Trois, Quatre, Cinq will run for - don't catch yourself having a \"zut alors!\" moment for missing it ;)"}
{"text":"I love their $1 oysters smaller but sweet. Gosh, if I stayed in Toronto longer, I would go there every day. I also had their veal liver, OMG, it is fantastic. LOVE it!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I loved this place. The food was great, the wait staff were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is so adorable! Has a great patio now that the weather is improving and the restaurant has a fair amount of seating with the lounge and dining area.   The downfall was that I found the service incredibly slow. I'm not sure if the server was just giving my friend and I time to talk but it could have been a little more efficient.   We ordered a bottle of their Pinot noir which was really nice. I enjoyed the extensive wine list. And then ordered the steak & frites as my entree. I order my steak medium rare and it was cooked perfectly and soooo many frites!! My friend ordered the duck confit and loved it as well.   This place has been on my radar for quite some time and it'll stay on my list of spots to return to when I'm in the mood for tasty French food."}
{"text":"Very good. Very well priced.  The oysters were very good and amazing value at 1$ each after 5 pm. The frog legs were delicious.  Highly recommend the oysters. And frog legs."}
{"text":"Splendid. Amazing. Magnificent. Need I say more?  Well, yes I actually do!   My partner and I came here for the prix fixe offerings. Three course meal for two for around $60? What a steal!  The decor was easy on the eyes. It was like eating in a study but you know. Not a study.  Our server was delightful. He anticipated our every need and followed up at the right times. He was hilarious and made us feel comfortable.   Moving onto the food: DAMN.   The truffled salad made my mouth water. I'm a sucker for truffle and vinaigrettes. So the combination of the two made my mind explode. The portion was filling but not too much for an appetizer. I would honestly just come here if I was craving for a good salad.   The duck confit was to die for. I've always wanted to try this unattainable (budget wise) and quite famous dish. It did not disappoint. Well, the chefs at Buff's didn't disappoint! It was so rich and delicious. I couldn't finish the whole thing but oh man, I'd scarf this thing down for a midnight snack. The ingredients meshed well together and you could really taste the intricate ingredients.   The dessert was really good as well. I'm not too much of a dessert person but it was pleasing to the palate.   Overall, a wonderful meal. I will definitely come back again, thanks to the chefs and the service.   This place made my taste buds go to heaven !"}
{"text":"Pretty much like all other O&B restaurants, Biff's is upscale with a classy vibe. Central location right across from Union Station. Dim lighting sets a romantic ambiance but it didn't feel intimate since the tables are so close together (at least the ones along the far left wall were).   We swung by after work for some dollar oysters (which starts after 5pm Tuesdays & Saturdays) and frankly, I was a little disappointed. They're tiny and some of them weren't even full oysters. I've definitely had better (i.e.: Nome Izakaya, Wilcox Gastropub to name a few).   Our server was friendly but maybe checked up on us one too many times.     I'll probably give this place another go in the future but until then, my impression of Biff's remains as overhyped."}
{"text":"I was just here today for the Winterlicious lunch and I was very impressed with the taste, service and quality of the food. The portion size was just right from the appetizer to the dessert. My hubby ordered the Truite au Bleu and I ordered the New Farm Greens to start. The champagne vinaigrette dressing was light and just the right amount. The trout was very flavorful and melted in our mouths. The chip underneath the trout gave it a nice light crunch. For the entree my hubby ordered the Shaved Sirloin Tartine (which was pretty much very thinly sliced sirloin which almost taste like roast beef/deli meat). The potato salad on the side was abit cold - would be nicer if it was a tad warmer......I ordered the Roasted Turkey & Canestri Pasta. The sauce was mixed in with a soft boied egg on top which made the sauce for the pasta more creamy. It had good turkey flavour with real pieces of turkey. Dessert was nice too. We ordered the Roasted Parsnip Sabayon and Camembert en Croûte. Both weren't too sweet and had some fruits. Nice way to end the meal...."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, servers that are helpful and willing to explain parts of the menu. I had Braise Beef Cheek & Bone Marrow, and Beef Bourghuignon. The plate presentation were nice, only overdone by the excellent taste and tenderness of the beef. My bride had Asparagus Soup, Sockeye Salmon. Both were flavorful. First time her but it will not be the last. We enjoyed the food very much.  Server was good. Thank you for the meal."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical coming here but it ended up being better than expected.  I ordered the 3 course set for $35, which included an appetizer, main and dessert.  As an add-on, I also ordered the fried pig ears ($7).  The fried pig ears were actually quite tasty.  It was served with some creamy mayo-like sauce and is definitely enough to share among 2-3 people.  For my 3-course meal, I started off with the mushroom soup which was quite good.  You can really taste the mushroom texture.  For the main, I had the beef bourguignon.  Among the onions and gnocchi was a large juicy chunk of beef, slightly on the fatter end, but very tender.  I was fan of this.  For dessert, I had the coconut angel cake with blueberry compote and lemon curd.  This was probably the most disappointing part of the meal as the angel cake itself was quite hard in some places and the blueberry compote was a bit too sweet.  Overall, the meal was better than I expected."}
{"text":"I just returned from a business lunch at Biff's. A caveat: I ordered the Summerlicious menu. Thus, I will avoid the tendency to speak on portion size, though I will say that I did leave wanting (this may or may not be related to the fact that our table was for some reason left off the \"gets a bread basket\" list.)  I had high expectations from the O&B brand. Those expectations were immediately quashed when we had sat for around 10-15 minutes without getting a second glance from the waitstaff. Finally, someone came and asked if we had been looked after (I'm pretty sure she could have guessed from our facial expressions, but we politely told her anyway that we hadn't.) Our drink orders were taken - I had a \"Lillet White Sangria\", which was basically a slightly fruity white wine with a raspberry in it.  For my order, I opened with the salmon tartare, which was the highlight of the meal. The mix of zucchini and carrot ribbons with the tartare, mayo and the endive was a perfect opener. I always appreciate dishes where every ingredient is easily consumed and discerned in one fork full.   The tartare was followed by Cha Ca La Vong, a crispy sautéed white fish with vermicelli noodles and \"Kernal Peanut Sauce.\" It wasn't bad - I cleaned my plate. However, I was not blown away by either the flavours or the technique. It was hoisin sauce and peanut with vermicelli and fish. Definitely a recipe easily recreated at home.  Finally, as a self-proclaimed \"cheese aficionado\" I naturally gravitated to the \"Biff's Summerlicious Cheese\" dessert. As advertised, it was an ounce of cheese with some artisanal honey and either overly toasted (or stale...crispy in any case) nut bread. My best guess on the cheese is it was smoked gouda. Certainly nobody was in a rush to elucidate me, so your guess is as good as mine.  All considered, the food was average, and the service not quite. I know Summerlicious can be a drag for some restaurant owners, and maybe they don't invest a lot of energy into customers that primarily expect too much for less. I'm empathetic, but I simply wasn't blown away. There are better offerings for 20 dollars in this city, and certainly there are better 10 dollar cocktails."}
{"text":"total bad experience. the chef is really odd. He came around to the tables. and was asking odd questions. I think his name was anthony. I only remember because it was an awkard conversation."}
{"text":"Went for summerlicious. 38$ for 3-course dinner. it's alright...advise you to steer clear of their salmon which was overcooked, underseasoned, and the skin wasn't crispy, yet they told me it was grilled... a bit disappointed..."}
{"text":"I've actually eaten at this restaurant once before and the second time around was a little underwhelming considering they had a fancy shmancy summerlicious menu with things that required google image searches (yes that's right. I did that). I'm not a foodie nor do I claim to be. I just like to eat food at all kinds of cool restaurants and share my experiences with others with the hopes that my review will help someone in some way shape or form because isn't that what Yelp is used for after all?  The service was great. I thought our waitress was very friendly and did a good job explaining meals to my coworkers that did not conduct dorky google image searches like me. Our food came out at a decent time and our dishes were taken away as soon as each course was finished which showed that the wait staff was very attentive to their tables.  $20 lunch menu (3 courses):  Appetizer: SMOKED COD BRANDADE This could have been the main meal in my opinion. It was the same size as the pork (small) but oh so delicious. Not too salty or overly fishy in flavour and served with frisée (bitter) & asparagus salad (subtle - balanced well with the bitter salad). A light app but a good pick.   Main: BREADED PORK ESCALOPE  My pork was not breaded. The portion was very small (about the same size as the fish cake) and also cut very thin. They did provide lots of beans though. The flavour was simply OK. The meat was juicy and covered in a light chasseur sauce but I still felt it was missing bacon. Mind you, I always feel like every meal needs bacon. I much preferred the fish cake over the pork.  Dessert: CHOCOLATE BANANA TART Chocolate + banana + peanut brittle = my favourite dessert combination ever on this planet! Add those layers into a crisp cookie-like textured tart crust and you got yourself a pretty awesome dessert, right? Not really. I did like the taste of the chocolate ganache and banana puree but I was disappointed with the tart crust itself as I found it a little too hard. The flavours met all expectations: chocolate ganache tasted like dark chocolate, the banana puree was banana flavoured, and the tart crust was not too sweet (albeit hard in texture) - nothing really spectacular but good nonetheless.  Overall, great service and okay food. I don't think I would eat here on a regular day other than summerlicious/winterlicious events simply because the prices are way over my budget and the portions are too small. I also didn't really find the place to be any different from other restaurants in the area (financial district)."}
{"text":"Came here for the summerlicious menu!  Got the Poached Salmon, Pork Croquette and Camembert en croute.  Fancy place! From the way the waiters dress to the table setting with double cutlery and fabric napkins, this is great for a date to dress up for!  I sat inside as my last visit I sat on the patio. They have nice leather & marble décor (the bill tray was real leather!)  Appetizer: Poached salmon, the salmon was tender and flaky. It was covered with a tangy tomato sauce with corn  Entrée: Pork croquette, one medium sized on top of bed of diced potato on a tangy sauce. Didn't like the tang to the potatoes personally. I'm impressed that the cut of meat is one piece and that it's so tender and flaky, it's like eating tuna, and pulls off like pulled pork. My only complaint is that it was incredibly salty-- the meat, the crust, the sauce. I only ate half.   Dessert: Camembert en croûte, I was surprised that the pastry was soaked in sauce. I'm not sure if the pastry is supposed to be crispy, but the texture is exactly like eating a microwaved croissant with cheese inside. It was very gooey, and I think I would prefer the pastry dry and crispy without the syrup.  My partner had a whipped cheese salad, burger and chocolate cake,  to which they all tasted alright,  except for the chocolate cake, it was dense and sweet to me as if it was made with shortening.   All in all,  great for a fancy meal! They just lost a star because my entree was way salty."}
{"text":"Tout n'a pas été parfait mais je pense que c'est un jeu de circonstances car ce restaurant a un sacré potentiel!  La nourriture même si j'attendais le goût du boeuf bourguignon de ma maman (oué j'en demande beaucoup je sais) était très bon, le saumon fumé excellent, le canard confit exquis et la cerise sur le gateau c'est bien sur le pain servi au début! Surement la 1ere fois que je mange du pain aussi bon qu'en France à Toronto! Quel plaisir!  Le service rien à redire, notre serveur était aux petits soins pour nous. Le seul hic a été à la fin, nous avons attendu 20 min l'addition pour problème informatique, donc un soir de St Valentin c'est moyen, mais ils nous ont déduit la boisson pour s'excuser de la gène occasionnée.  Pour le lieu c'est vraiment sympa! pas typiquement francais mais agréable quand même! Le petit plus: entendre gainsbourg chanter! ;)"}
{"text":"Came to Biff's for winterlicious again this year.  I liked the menu very much, i had cured salmon, veal with egg noodles, and cheese plate for dessert. Hubby had a salad with mangos and pears, halibut, and spiced cake. We both enjoyed our dishes very much. I was gonna go with the duck confit.. very curious if they make it like paris... there's always a next time! They serve a bowl of baby pickles and a jar of homemade mustard with the main dish and I thought that was a nice touch. both are very refreshing and tasty/  The food portions are not very large, but well made and delicate. kinda expensive but it was well worth it."}
{"text":"From start to the finish, I had a really good experience dining here for Winterlicious during dinner time. The restaurant decor is quite nice when you walk in. There is also complimentary coat check which is quite nice. It's $35 for the Winterlicious menu and it's one of the better deals to dine for. For the appetizer, I ordered the Pork & Foie Gras Terrine. It was nice and delicious. For the entree, I ordered the Filet de Boeuf. It was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. Probably the best main dish I had during my Winterlicious journey in 2016. Also loved the fries that accompanied the dish. For dessert, I ordered the Crème Caramel. It was an interesting dessert but I loved it. It tasted good. I also ordered their $1 Oysters as they were having their oyster special on the Tuesday we were at the restaurant. The staff and our server were quite friendly and efficient. They got our drinks and our food out in a timely manner. Overall, great dining experience and great ambient feeling when you dine there. Definitely one of my more memorable Winterlicious dining experience and will highly recommend it to others."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to check out this cute looking french bistro one day while walking around Toronto.  We come in, this not so happy host seats us and then says...you will have five minutes to order, because we end lunch at 2:30pm and then reopen at 5pm for dinner.  Now that does not shock me, many places shut down between those hours to prepare for a dinner menu. But the way she said it to us, was like your mother saying \"I will give you 5 minutes to decide what you want for lunch\"  Anywho, we look and decide to order some sandwiches.   The waitress comes over and says, \"the following items are no longer available for lunch and names off a few things. Well our luck, one of them was the sandwiches we decided to order. Well this waitress looked like we told her she was fired. She was so mad and stormed off before we could say anything, and comes back...\"ok fine we can make them\". She did not even give us a chance to tell her that we would order something else on the menu, but she just ran off in mid sentence to ask.  So we get our food a few minutes later, and are told \"hurry and finish up, we are closing in 10 minutes.\" So we are beyond pissed now, why seat us, take our damn order, make the food and then tell us hurry up we have to close???? Just tell us when we walk in that you are closing.  So then some lights go off in the place, we continue eating and laughing because this shit is just insanity. The waitress comes over while we are still eating, and places the check on the table. So much for dessert haha.  We pay, leave a small tip...because, well the waitress had left for her break...and I said to my wife later, \"you know it would have been all worth it, if the food has actually tasted good.\"   We also wondered...what if we did not eat our food faster? Would they have turned all the lights off and locked us in until 5pm?  Subpar food...awful service...and the craziest dining experience I have had while on vacation."}
{"text":"Took my friend Steve there last night for dinner since he had a craving for oysters and he was very impressed by the food there. We had two dozens of fresh oysters (delicious BTW), shared some bouillabaisse and ribeye and it was delicious. The service was superb also. All in all a very pleasant night. We went there at the right time because in August you can BYOW and there was no cork fee. I really liked the restaurant and will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Winterlicious Menu!  If you live in Toronto, you're probably familiar with Winterlicious, and this was the best Winterlicious dinner I've ever had.  My friend ordered the steak frites and I ordered the pork belly and we shared... mmm best of both world's!  Even the fries with the steak were amazing! Best fries I've ever had, perfectly fried, couldn't get enough.  The steak was a delicious, flavourful and rich with a sauce to die for. And the pork belly was melt in your mouth delicious with a hint of apply jelly.   I loved that the servers treated us well even though the majority of people there were in suits and clearly on business dinners and we were a party of 8 in jeans and pretty chill.   They offered a wine pairing with each course and the server took the time to explain each selection.  Overall it was just such an enjoyable experience. Bravo Biff's bistro for serving exceptional food with a high level of service without pretention.  Much appreciated!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here and will definitely be back. Service was great: very attentive and thoughtful collection of waiter, bartender, host and crew. We ate like kings for a reasonably good price, ordering off the table d'hôte menu allowed for a delicious soup appetizer, hearty and delicious main, and generous dessert course. I enjoyed the duck which was surprisingly less fatty or oily than most, but still flavourful and salty. Cocktails were perfect as was the wine recommendations. All what you would expect from a staple, classy but affordable French bistro. Will return and do recommend."}
{"text":"Foie gras is the best and my favorite! Chiefs are so busy during winter delicious. I think that's why Steaks are so so. If u want to try authentic foie gras, Biff's Bistro may be ur choice."}
{"text":"Came to Biff's during my last trip to Toronto. My sister and her BF had been a couple of times and made reservations for a Saturday night.  First off, the service was great. We were greeted the minute we walked through the door and offered to check our coats. The busboy was attentive at filling up our glasses and clearing plates. Anthony paired our dishes with the perfect wines. He made some great suggestions on the menu and helped us pick some yummy dishes.  The atmosphere is very French bistro- wood tables & chairs, large windows, tall but simple floral arrangements. The decor was really chic and impressive.  We had a charcuterie starter with tons of obscure meats- from suckling to horse! The mustard served with the platter is delicious! I wish I had the recipe! We also got our share of 1$ oysters :)  Entrees were:  - Duck confit with duck hearts and lentilles (5*) - Sweetbreads (3*- acquired taste) - Horse (5*)  We finished off with a cheese plate and profiteroles for dessert. We also got dessert cocktails and port to cap off a great meal."}
{"text":"Had another lunch here yesterday. I FINALLY didn't order the mushroom soup. I am SO GLAD I went for it (or, I suppose... didn't go for it)... something new!  Upon being inspired by one of my table mate's orders (the daily pasta special), I went for Les Oeufs Du Jour! It was a mushroom and goat cheese omelet with frites and a salad. OMD LES FRITES. And yes, I meant OMDieu, not OMGod. WOW. I've never tasted fries like this. Crisp and salty, with fresh parsley... sinfully delicious.  I love Biff's. New surprises every time!"}
{"text":"2nd O&B restaurant of this 2014 Winterlicious isn't looking too good. Though the atmosphere is fancy, and busy, their service is sub-par.   45mins into our dining experience we had only received our main entree, however I will give them the benefit of the doubt since it was lunch time.   The staff was polite, presentable, and knowledgable in recommending us a few dishes. For Starters Crispy Pork Terrine with with a artichoke puree and picked carrot onion salad was a lovely, grounded pork in filo dough roll, fresh, tasty, and presentable 4/5  The entree was their Braised Chermoula Lamb Sandwich, served with their in-house pita, mayo, and Panisse frties (flour and chicpeas), presentation looked very plain, the cuts of lamb were nice and thick, frites were magnificent, however it was missing some level of freshess, perhaps some greens to give the dish more color, versatility, etc. 3/5  Dessert; Chocolate & salted caramel Pave 4/5 not bad, rich, served with whipped cream and mint ontop....  Overall I've been oth other OB restaurants but this isn't the best.  I dont understand as to why they have two OB restaurants beside on another along Front St.....doesn't make sense. I will not be going back to this OB restauarant. I would give it 3.5/5"}
{"text":"biff's bistro---come on, i mean calling a place like this biff's.  it sounds more like a name for a greasy spoon diner down the street behind a buillding and maybe some shady characters lurking around  but i digress.  my wife and i are in toronto looking for a place to go to eat.  i haven't had steak tartare for a long time--thats what happens when you live in the states, i guess.  That, and you don't find smelts in new mexico.  so i was an extremely happy camper when we had dinner tonight.  thoroughly enjoyed the meal.  The mushroom soup didnt taste like old musty mushrooms--it was light and tasty.  She had the beef bourguignon and enjoyed that as well.  the chicken liver parfait was light and fluffy, not heavy.  was impressed--and would have made a hell of a sandwich.    now i have to make sure i get back to toronto sometime so i can get the same old tired dinner--smelts and steak tartare---my version of surf and turf.  but geez,  who in hell names a french bistro biff's??"}
{"text":"One of the upscale French restaurants under the O&B arm. I've been here twice for the past 2 years, due to the restaurant's central location.  Pros: - Great steak tartare as well as some other signature French dishes. If you're craving some good French food, this is a place to check out. -  Buck-a-shuck $1 Oysters on Tuesday nights - one of the many places in the Downtown core that has good oyster deals on Tuesdays.  - Lovely patio. I love this part of Front street as it is more quaint and calm compared to other parts of the Downtown core.   Cons: - In my opinion, many of the dishes are overpriced. Most entrees are well above the $25-$30 price range. The last time I came for buck-a-shuck oysters and a few sides including a small Chacuterie board and the goat cheese tart to share with my friend, we both ended up paying around $30 without any drinks or feeling full.  - Service was mediocre on my last visit. The table beside us was receiving many bread refills, while we received none. When the waiter served our Chacuterie board, some of the items fell off the plate but were not replaced. I also noticed some of my dishes were dirty on the patio. Overall, the service does not match the price charged on the menu."}
{"text":"I've never been here to eat in their dining room.  Just the bar and patio for their buck a shuck oysters and seafood platter.  I've never had bad service once.  Every server we've had has been efficient and extremely friendly.  I have come for buck a shuck oysters in the past where the oysters were the size of pennies but the couple of visits they have been a good size and variety (not just malepeques).  They also have a great deal on corking fee I believe on Mondays, which I would recommend because their wines are expensive!  Once of the best places to go for a good deal on oysters because of the service and ambience."}
{"text":"We were here for Summerlicious.  I will say that O&B restaurants never disappoint.  The food was delectable.  I had the pork belly, and cake.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  They have a strong wine list and drink menu.  The patio was lovely.  They did everything right.  We enjoyed our meal and had a great girls' night out.  I totally recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Went there for winterlicious, nice decor, nice service, food is OK. Do not order the oysters even if they are on sale. They are too small."}
{"text":"Lovely place! I like the atmosphere and decorations - everything looks beautiful! The food is amazing, they have the best beef tartare in the city. I don't remember the names of the dishes but everything was delicious.  The service depends on the day: one time it was very fast, even thought they were busy; next time it took half an hour or more to get the appetizers..but still, I love this place!"}
{"text":"Service was non existent, some hipster waiter with a holier than thou attitude.  Food was actually ok but took ages to arrive and I had to grapple the guy at the end to get the bill.  Thing is our bill would've been much higher if we were asked if we wanted more drinks and apps, but no, captain hipster was more interested in his looking at his poncy suspenders in the mirror, shame.  Up your game guys and girls!!"}
{"text":"Went there about two weeks ago for dinner.  Good food and very friendly service.  Love their prix fixe menu.  The duck config was super good.  I was so stuffed with the three-course menu :)  I need to go there and try their $1 oysters soon after work!!!"}
{"text":"Very romantic ambiance and food is very veryyyy rich. I ordered the mushroom soup, beef ribs and le tigre. Mushroom soup was very creamy. Delicious. The beef rib was great but the couscous was drowning in the olive oil - which i didnt care for. But the beef was cooked to perfection.  As for desert, the portion was right on. Le tigre was amazingly fresh and had hard choco bits inside. The chocolate sauce on top was amazing but the raspberry sauce on top was too citrusy for my liking.   I got a little sick in the middle of the night but i am guessing it was the mushroom soup because I was the only one who ordered it from my table. Over all 4/5!!! Amazing."}
{"text":"Went for buck a shuck with some coworkers. Horribly slow service. It took an hour just to get our oysters and it was all we ordered. It wasn't even busy in the restaurant. Empty tables allllll around.   Oysters were great but definitely too slow.   But the server was very kind and polite the whole time. So maybe its better on other nights."}
{"text":"The food was average to below average.  Based on price and ownership (the same company owns Canoe), I expected more.  Atmosphere might be good, but when we got there 830pm on a Thursday, the place was dead.  I would give above average points to our steaks.  Fresh, good quality and well made.  The service was friendly but slow.  Our waiter spent much of his time talking to the guests next to us and didn't come over until well after we had finished our entree.  I would not go again."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious $35 dinner with two friends. We sat inside and I love the French bistro décor (sat near the bar) - very comfortable and cozy yet classy and great place for quiet conversation.   Service was ok but I found that the server interrupted a few times. Quite awkward as I was in the middle of a conversation with my friend... Usually they would pause and get your attention before asking a question??   The bread to start was fresh and warm, but really tough to chew! I was scared I would lose a tooth.   Salmon Tartare -  I liked this and it was great paired with the thin, slightly bitter endive - something different than pairing with toasts. The mayo was good too. There was a lot of thin carrot ribbons.  Beef Steak Diane - nice charred crust but it was not as rare as I wanted for a medium rare. While it was tender, it was also quite fiberous/difficult to cut and could be more juicy. I liked the mushrooms, green beans and potatoes.   Un Bordel de Fraises - essentially strawberries and whipped cream, this was a nice sweet & sour combination. Very simple pairing of strawberries, rhubarb, light Chantilly and meringue bits. (But the spoon was a bit big for the jar)  Also shared half a dozen of buck a shuck oysters. They were a BC variety, too fishy for my taste.   Overall the dishes were very standard yet well executed."}
{"text":"This was my second time here at this place in a month. The food continues to be very well made and tasty. The staff there were always friendly and courteous. Never too abrupt and always wait for the right moment to ask questions. The steaks were. Well made w such fresh asparagus. The salad was nicely seasoned but too big of a portion!!! The hors d'oeuvre were absolutely delicious. Especially the spreads!!! A must try at this place. I had the same dessert both times I was there, just tells you how good it was. Will definitely return to this place."}
{"text":"A wonderful celebration meal, we began with kir royale while perusing the menu.  The fixed price menu offers several popular selections; great value at only $34.95 for three courses. A stand out was the beef bourguignon, absolutely perfect.  Service was top notch, and the dining room is charming. I have a new favourite restaurant in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Today is the first day of Winterlicious in our beautiful city.  Enjoyed Winterlicious at Biff's today.  The food was A+ especially the Poulet Grand-Mere.  The Waitstaff was excellent; especially our Waiter who was very knowledgeable of the menu offerings.  FIN"}
{"text":"Treated my wife for her b-day last year. Made reservation online requesting for a table in the corner of the restaurant as i wanted to make it an intimate evening as it was my wife's bday.  To my surprise, we did get a special table. It was special because it was in the corner. As soon as we sat, we got a glass of wine on the house 'compliments of management' for the occasion. Then once we ordered, we got free apps and 3 different types of desserts 'compliments of the chef for the princess' with a small candle in the middle of a french pastry.  Besides all that, the food was amazing, ambience-awesome. Service -top notch.  Highly recommend it for either a business lunch or a romantic feast."}
{"text":"This is a lovely restaurant, good food, great service and wonderful ambiance.  it is a little bit pricey but the quality of the food and overall experience certainly makes up for it!  My colleagues and I enjoy coming after work for drinks and $1.00 oysters.  We tried the charcuterie & fromage - it's $38.00 - manageable for sharing!  I definitely recommend splurging and trying this restaurant for an elevated dining experience and expanding your palette to new flavours."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful date night at Biff's! Tasty French fare, great wine, lovely ambiance and the service was exceptional.   We ordered the small charcuterie board (the terrine was a highlight) and two entrees to share: the steak frites and the daily special of Fogo Island cod. We ordered the steak medium rare - it was cooked perfectly and came with a mountain of crispy fries. The cod was a bit dry which was disappointing, but the puréed cauliflower and other veggies it came with were sooo good they made up for it. Generous portions overall, especially for French food.  Our waiter was amazing and incredibly attentive! Always filling our wine glasses, brought out GF crackers after he asked for dietary restrictions, brought out a lovely treat in celebration of our anniversary, even folded our napkins when we stepped away to the restroom! Really nice touches which made the evening very memorable."}
{"text":"Out of all the O & B restaurants - Biff's is a sentimental favourite.  Why?   It's a classic French-style Bistro, service has always been mostly excellent and attentive while being more or less unobtrusive.  In fact, I would said it would be a good date restaurant, if you're looking to impress, but not completely overdo it.  Their steak frites is excellent and easily one of the best that I've eaten in the city.   However - in four visits  - 3 visits, I've had an excellent meal, the one meal that wasn't so great was well... a non-summerlicious meal. It's weird, but there you are. It seems to be a bit of an anomaly - as usually restaurant meals during any 'licious promotion can be inconsistent. Also, I usually find the desserts at Biff's to be not that great compared to their Starters and their mains.  Most recent visit was pretty good -  we were seated in one of the smaller private rooms - which probably sent me into giddy excitement - as this room had an ironwork maps of the city of Paris, it was a wonderful reminder of my trip back in October.  Food, I had ordered the starter - Pork Rillettes, served with an apricot compote and buckwheat crackers - good generous starter portion, overall flavour was decent, but didn't blow me out of the water.  I had the Grilled calamari for the main, which was enjoyable, the calamari wasn't over-cooked and over charred - which can be risky in some places and the best part was that the calamari didn't smelly fish.  For the last course - I had the cheese course, the cheese was ok - but once again - I find the area of desserts is where Biff's has a tendency to fall flat. I'm not saying that they're terrible, but for some reason, they just fail to impress, I can't figure it out  - like I've had a lemon tart here and while the curd was decently lemony, the crust was well mushy and rather bland.  Their fresh strawberry lemonade was good - but then again pink lemonade is always good and this one had just enough fizz to make me happy and it was smoothly tart and sweet at the same time.  Service was pretty good, wonderfully attentive, until it right after the dessert - when we tried to look around for our server to ask for the bill, which took some trying to get their attention, but we did get it eventually. But as an observation - it's a bit disconcerting to have four different people check in on you, in regards to your meal, every time a course is served - only have them pretty much disappear on you once the meal has been more or less completed. I do like to linger after a meal and I don't like being rushed out, but please at least give me some eye contact, when I'm trying to get your attention.  Overall - Biff's is a pretty good restaurant, with good food, atmosphere, and service."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with my bf and his family to use an O+B gift card. It was pretty decently busy when we got there and we ordered the oysters right away since there's a 40 min wait time and the max order is 24 at a time. Did I mention it's a buck a shuck? Oh, the 50 reviews before me probably did. The only downside was there were some shell bits in the oysters but for $1 I couldn't complain.   I won't get into everyone else's orders since there were 5 of us. This review is based solely on what I ate. I ordered off the prix fixe menu since I wanted to try the beef bourguignon anyways from someone else's Yelp review. For $9 more I got chicken liver pate and ice cream and sorbet for dessert too!   The chicken pate was a big portion that I wasn't expecting. It came with pickled beets (I think) and the house mustard which brought the pate to another level. It was a great combination and I would definitely get it again.   The beef bourguignon was absolutely delicious. The beef was so tender and flavourful with a good amount of fat in it. The gnocchi, root vegetables and mushrooms were the perfect side dishes for the beef and I couldn't eat enough of it. I didn't want it to end. I'm definitely going back just for this dish.   The ice cream and sorbet was pretty good too. The flavours I got were mango sorbet and milk chocolate ice cream. I REALLY liked the milk chocolate ice cream and I would probably buy a tub if they sold it!   Overall: Service was excellent - waiter came around filling water and checking up on us frequently.  Food was awesome - the whole meal was only $34.95 plus tax (not including the oysters which were only $1 each anyways).  Decor and ambiance is nice - comfortable chairs and a nice patio.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Biff's for the very first time on a Winterlicious occasion.  What made it a great introduction was the impeccable service we received from Ashley L the whole night!  She was friendly, courteous, and so professional and her smile was contagious!    Now for the food! The mullitagawny soup was absolutely delicious but I have to say the foie gras won out. We had the filet de boeuf and pork and they were really quite good.  The pork definitely lost out to the beef though in terms of taste and flavour.  The portion was a bit too small as well.  The beef, however, was one of the most perfect steaks I've ever had. Finally, dessert was great - the cheese platter was definitely very enlightening.  They had some light cheeses there to suit the majority's palate.  The creme caramel...well, I really dislike any creme brulee and creme caramel so I didn't actually touch that at all.    Overall, I think the fantastic service was a determining factor that I'd definitely go back again.  I would love to try out their oysters and their non-licious menu outside of that time period!  Hopefully, we'll have Ashley again!"}
{"text":"Came here for boyfriend's birthday dinner on Saturday night. The service was excellent - servers and hosts were super friendly. They were attentive and cleaned our table quickly. We ordered 3 course dinner for each of us. Food was pretty good, but not mind blowing. They were served pretty quickly though. $1 oysters were pretty good too, but they were pretty small. But can't complain since they were a dollar each. Overall, I recommend this place... We thoroughly enjoyed our experience here."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5 Stars   Finally having a scorching hot day after a few cold ones, my friend and I decided to go downtown in honor of patio season. Originally planning to go to Oliver and Bonnacini (sp?) Cafe Grill, we were quickly directed to Biff's Bistro because we didn't have a reservation.   The decor of this establishment is great. It's very chic!   I found the service to be great. When we walked in, the Hostess was quite friendly and quickly seated us outside. Our server came often to our table to see how we were doing.   Can't speak for what my friend ordered, but I ordered the Boston Bibb Salad and Mussels (w/ tomatoes, parsley, and garlic in a white wine sauce). My meal was a-ok. Nothing to rave about, but also nothing to rant about.   I love the location and atmosphere so I think that I'll find myself here again."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with their $1 oysters except for the fact that me and my girlfriend had stomach cramps after which I question if they properly washed the oysters, but none the less it was good, but be aware we waited 30 minutes for 2 dozen oysters to be shucked and we were their first customers to order them....drinks are quite pricy here, draft beer was like $8 and my girlfriends sangria was $11, so here's the thing our waiter said they didn't have sangria on the menu but they could make it for us and we asked if they had fresh fruits and he was like 'of course, no problem'......LIES, the only fresh fruit we got was a slice of apple as decoration on the tip of the glass with no fruits in the sangria at all, it tasted like sprinkling white wine....so u've been warned Other than that I don't think I would ever come back to this place except for their $1"}
{"text":"Biff's gets 5 stars for making a 50th birthday party for 20 people (with food allergies to accommodate) a flawless event!  From the coordination at O&B events, the impeccable service, communication and attention to detail by the two staff assigned to our group and the delicious food, we could not have asked for better.   All of our guests had a wonderful time. Thank you Biff's!   *The beef tenderloin with mushrooms and foie gras was the highlight of our menu.   We will be back for dinners and oysters soon!"}
{"text":"A 3.5 star experience. My husband and I arrived at 5:45 pm Tuesday night for an early dinner before a 7:30 Raptors game. I advised the hostess when I made the reservation that we needed to leave in 75 minutes. No joke- they advised all the 3 servers who attended our table. Our main server kept an eye on all the entrees to ensure we didn't have to wait more than a few minutes between courses, and did not forget about us when the place got busy at around 6:30.  I was disappointed about their salmon tartar served on a bed of lentils, under some beets and pickled beets. The pickled beets were too overpowering. Then came my main entree - the sesame crusted tuna was cooked to perfection! Dessert was also great- the almond- orange cake was small in portion, but very rich, also served with a scoop of fragrant vanilla ice cream. The servers definitely made it a lovely experience!"}
{"text":"Good choices smaller dishes, very interesting tastes, some really exotic, but delicious!"}
{"text":"Went there for Winterlicious as a double date and it was a pleasant experience .  It was somewhat busy for a Sunday night but we were able to receive a great service from our waitress and good recommendations .  The 4 of us elected to go for the Yukon Gold Veloute that was very impressive. Unctuous texture, great mix of flavors and good portion.   I then went for the Northern Woods mushroom dauphinoise that was fine, but forgettable. The dish could have been warmer, the seasoning more present. It felt borderline like a cafeteria dish.   For desserts though, I was able to taste both the Sabayon and the Camembert en croute. The first one frankly took me by surprise. And by that I mean a good surprise! Never imagine that parsnip would have made such a great dessert. And the Camembert was just lovely mixed with the raspberry and honey butter.   One thing that annoyed me is the restaurant very liberal use of the \"local\" term on their Winterlicious menu. For instance, when I've asked the waitress where the free range salmon was from and she said B.-C., that's a very long stretch for local. 150km is usually the norm."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner before heading to the Aquarium. My friend and I ordered 24 oysters that were $1, charcuterie board and pig's ears. The oysters were delicious and I have no complaint for $1 each. I also really enjoyed the charcuterie board. I've never been a fan of pig's ears but I think Biff's made it particularly poorly. I would stick to ordering it at a Chinese restaurant. I also ordered a drink - not your grandma's fruit cake. What drew me to the drink was the pumpkin cider which I could actually taste in this drink! I thought the drink was well made. Lastly, we ordered dessert. I don't remember what I ordered but my friend ordered artisanal ice creams and sorbets and I remember it being very flavourful!  I definitely want to come back here and try an actually entree. It was a fun night at Biff's!"}
{"text":"Came here for the Winterlicious Lunch 2014.  I started with the Hillside Farms Beet and Carrot Soup. It was flavourful, but not entirely what I expected. It was more of a curried soup (which the menu did not let on), and I felt the spices overwhelmed the flavour of the carrot and the beet. I was kind of expecting a sweeter soup. Like a borscht but with pureed carrot.  I had the bouillabaisse for my main. It was pretty good. You definitely need to eat it with some of the bread provided for the table though. The baguette they put on top was kind of a bit on the soggy side. I felt the fish was overcooked, as it was a little dry. You definitely needed to get that fish swimming in the bouillabaisse sauce to get a good bite.  Lastly, I had the Chocolate and Salted Caramel Pave with Cherry Puree. Also another dish that wasn't what I expected. A pave is something rectangular, but I expected something more just chocolatey... like a fudge or a mousse. But it was a cake, and no where on the menu said it was a cake. There was also nothing caramel about it, and honestly it was pretty much a black forest cake. It was a chocolate cake with whipped cream and cherry sauce. It reminded me very much of the black forest cakes my grandma has made over the years. I did like eating it, but again... not what I expected.  Overall I felt I got my monies worth on a Winterlicious lunch, but I wasn't overwhelmed. As well, for a prix-fix lunch, it was a little on the slow side. So expect the meal to take a while. I would recommend checking out Bannock instead of Biff's if you haven't been to either."}
{"text":"Service was impeccable, food was fantastic. There are some unusual menu picks but we stayed in our comfort zone with fresh mushroom soup, steak frites and albacore tuna. Very pleased & recommend. I wasn't overly thrilled with the selection of white wines by the glass. They have $25 cork fee, if you're a white wine diner I'd recommend that if it's convenient. Flavours were fantastic! O, and so were the cappuccino's!"}
{"text":"The Filet Mignon was excellent. However, the service and decor were lacking relative to the reputation of the owners. They are attempting for an old school 20's look, complete with music from that era. The tables were pretty cramped together and the look just seemed dated and didnt wow. Our waiter did not seem very knowledgeable or helpful.  Overall I had a good time and enjoyed the food, but it won't be on my must-repeat list."}
{"text":"I came here for their dollar oyster deal. Upon arrival we were greated and seated in the middle of the restaurant.   We ordered a dozen of oysters and some appetizers. We waited quite a bit before our food came and was very disappointed at the size of the oysters. They were much smaller than your regular oysters(the oyster itself, not the shell)..almost flat. The appetizers did not taste great. We were still hungry after the tiny oysters so we wanted to order another dozen. Took us forever to get our server's attention and took them forever to bring out the oysters.   No service here, had to ask for more water every single time.  So after a dozen of oysters and an appetizer each, we left and went to another restuarant for a complete meal and drinks."}
{"text":"The oysters are disgusting... Don't go for cheap oysters.. They stink and smell like dead for years... We had to throw away at least 5 of them... Didn't say anything until paying the bill cuz we didn't want the waiter to feel embarrassed; but after we brought it up in a friendly way, he didn't feel sorry at all and didn't even ask us why we said so, but just said they can't be any fresher for THREE times. Btw no bread was served until we asked for the second time, and it was not even busy at all. No comment. Will never come back again."}
{"text":"We were a group of 11 trying out the winterlicious menu.  I didn't have high expectations as ppl wrote avg reviews.  I have to say the food was surprisingly good and the service from our server was just right.  Balanced attention and left us adequate time to chat and decide.  I had the salmon for appetizer, braised beef for main and cheese platter for dessert.  would highly reco the cheese selection."}
{"text":"This is a mini review of the lunch I had here a few weeks ago. My other review and pictures are attached.  http://nearafar.wordpress.com/2011/10/19/near-biffs/  VIBE  I came here for a press lunch, so I can't comment on the vibe in the main dining room. I can note that I was promptly greeted by the hostess and led down this narrow and quiet hallway to the private dining room by the waiter. The staff were really lovely and as attentive as they could be to a group of twenty.  The private dining room is absolutely gorgeous. Blood red walls are carefully curated with iconic French posters and photographs, all framed in black. The photographs are all different sizes, but the decorator made it work. Kudos! This is a great room to have a business meeting or employee lunch. And the bathrooms? Well, they're lovely. I'm also in love with the French style of tiling they have on their floors.   WE ATE Our group was given a special prixe fixe menu, which isn't on the typical menu (I saw some items, but not all items on the regular menu; otherwise, I'm blind and I apologize). I started with the mushroom tarragon soup with a dash of truflle oil (clearly, if you're reading my reviews truffle oil is one of my favourite things).  It was great! My main was the steak. I order my steak medium-well and in this case, I'm wishing I ordered it medium-rare. It was well cooked, but a bit tough. And we were given butter knives for our steaks. It was very awkward physically cutting my steak in a room of nineteen silent people. There was a bit of a giggle and our server came to our rescue with the knife.  I finished with the crème brulee, which was torted just enough to reach so I could devour its gooey centre.  I would come back and like to try their basque chicken, duck confit and filet mignon. It's a tad on the splurge side, but I think this would be a great second date place.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Get to Biff's in a jiff! Though I like \"Get to Biffy's in a Jiffy! \"better (said in an English accent). *Still no copywriting job.  Help to Yelp."}
{"text":"For my family's annual Christmas dinner, we decided to stick with the O&B chain and try Biffs out. I was incredibly disappointed last year when we went to Jump instead of Biff's and I've been dying to try it since.   We arrived right on time and were seated promptly upon arriving. They took our coats at the door, which was a nice touch. We did see they had oysters for $1 each by the dozen and they were keeping a little score tab at the front. I guess they order a few hundred and count down until they're all gone. This should tell you something about how good those oysters are ;)  We were a party of 6, so we decided to split a few appetizers to get a taste of everything. We had an order of Foie Gras, Pigs ears, a dozen oysters, lamb belly confit and deep fried smelts. The foie gras was served with a lovely little wonton (although that's not what it was, its the best word to describe the crispy stuffed triangle of deep fried goodness that accompanied the foie gras) and was excellent (luckily I got to eat almost all of it myself :D), the pigs ears were great, nice and crunchy in little strips. The lamb belly confit was out of this world good, but be sure that you get some of the sauce at the bottom and the little berries that come too. I've never had smelts before but they were quite nice, delicately breaded and fried and very simple. The oysters however... They had a nice light pile of freshly grated horseradish and some red wine vinagrette with shallots in it. I generally don't like horseradish out of the bottle, but the fresh horseradish was SO good, especially with the red wine and shallot vinagrette. Yum!  For my main, I ended up choosing the lamb shank, which I believe was a special that day. It was good, but having had lamb shank the week prior at another restaurant, I wasn't a fan of how the shank was prepared. There was no sauce or anything to the lamb. Very simply done but I felt it could have used a bit more, some sauce, some garnish, something to set off the flavor of the lamb a bit more.  Our server was quite good, if a little unsure of herself, but I think that was mainly due to the fact that english wasn't her first language and having to recall various components and ingredients may have proven difficult. However, she was very knowledgeable and pleasant to deal with.  A few things I didn't like: our table was very high compared to the height of the booth and chairs. I felt a bit like a kid in a big kid seat without a booster. The restaurant was slightly noisy, but I think the size of the tables made it more difficult to hear everyone because we were that much further apart.   Overall, I really enjoyed Biff's and I hope to go back for another special meal soon. I had no idea it was tucked away on Front street, so close to the GO station and very conveniently located."}
{"text":"First off...for being $1/oyster (after 4pm), I couldn't get enough.  They were so fresh and delicious.  One dozen wasn't enough.  The pig's ears...eh.  The escargot were delicious.  The chicken liver pate was fantastic. The rabbit entree was average.  The cocktails were delicious.  And the service was great.  Yes, I consumed a lot that night...but it was so delicious!"}
{"text":"I have to say... I was quite surprised by how delicious the salmon was at Biff's Bistro. The skin was nice and crispy, the fish just melts in your mouth and the sauce was perfect. Unfortunately, the creme brulee was a different story. It was torched to the point that it was as hard as a rock - if they made a rink of creme brulee, people can skate on it.   If you do decide to try the place, I would highly recommend just getting the salmon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their \"Shucks for a Buck\" event that runs every single day from 5pm to 7pm or until they run out of oysters to shuck. (They carry 500 at the beginning of their 5pm sale) Their oysters are small compared to ones that you see at Rodneys but the price you get for them is definitely worth it. It takes around 30-45 minutes to shuck 24 oysters and that's the most you can get at one time.    Other than their oysters, I absolutely love their food. It's ambient and the servers are very attentive and very friendly. Their bread is absolutely fresh and the experience is just overall fantastic. I haven't had any dinners there in a while so I'll update when I get to eat there again! : )   Definite recommend for a night out or a date night."}
{"text":"Recommended by a local, decided to give it a try. Service was friendly, top notch and the food was deeelicious. My honey had the duck confit, cooked perfectly crisp on the outside, succulent and falling right off the bone. I had the Tortiere, a tasty meaty pastry lightly toasted on the outside and melt in your mouth tender on inside! Definitely Recommended, Best meal in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I've been back to Biff's numerous times since my initial review and every time it was great. That's why I suggested to a friend that we meet up there for drinks, oysters and catch up.  Little did we know that we had walked in on launch party night for a new Dirty Bits bar menu and oyster party.  We were seated in the last available table in the bar area when we ran into fellow Yelper, Karen L.  Not really a big coincidence since we're both oyster fans (I got to witness the new parasite friend in her oyster).  We placed our order for two dozen oysters and 2 Pimm's Cup ($13). Our drinks were long devoured while the wait was on for our oysters.  Notably the place was a lot busier than any time I've ever been there but knowing that the event might attract customers, Biff's should have been better prepared.  About an hour after ordering, our server turned up with a plate of oysters on a melted bed of ice.  Some of the oysters had fallen into the watery puddle and it did not look appetizing at all.    We ate one and we knew something was off...they were warm and the taste was not particularly appetizing.  We mentioned this to our server and his first suggestion was to offer us a few more free (possibly bad tasting warm) oysters.    We declined and he took the plate off our table.  As we were discussing going some where else, he reappeared with 2 separate plates of oysters.  These ones were on actual beds of ice.  Not sure if he just took the oysters from the original plate and replaced them on ice.  We tried these ones and they were better, at the very least cold.   We finished up and quickly asked for the bill.  Another server came by and asked if we needed anything else and we expressed our disappointment with both the service and quality of oysters.    We did get to sample a few items from the new bar menu including fondue balls, smelts, duck confit poutine, and tuna on radish and one small drink - jalapeño margarita.  I think the wait for our oysters overshadowed any of the samples.  I think O&B could have had an event with better service to showcase their new menu and get people excited.  Too bad because they usually do things up nice and classy."}
{"text":"Went as a group of four specifically for the buck a shuck deal (everyday after 5:00 pm). They start a countdown on Fridays with 700 oysters but be warned, they go fast! We got there just before 7:00 pm and it was already down to 430. Each table is allowed to order 24 oysters per order but you can order another round once the oysters arrive at your table (20-40 minutes). When the oysters came I was surprised to see how small they were. I'm not complaining about the $1 deal, but from other pictures they look bigger. The manager informed us they were from New Brunswick.   Everything else is pricey (what you'd expect of a French restaurant) so I opted for the La Crêpe de Jardin ($21) which was very good, but I'd rather go to Crêpes á Go Go. The waitress did a lovely job of recommending an amber beer from Muskoka (I wanted something similar to Guinness. This one is lighter).   Service is great. The waitresses are attentive and pleasant. The manager walks around chatting people up and are overall a warm group of people. Great spot for a date night but I won't be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"I fully expected Biff's Bistro to be a bit touristy (given the location) but was pleasantly surprised with this place. On a Saturday evening it seemed to be mostly locals. There was a wide demographic of customers here, from elderly couples to a few large, boisterous groups of early 20-somethings.  The patio looked beautiful here but the interior was equally pleasant. Decor was definitely a bit frou-frou (the Queen would be all over this place), but this is generally what you expect at a French Bistro.  We didn't try any oysters (oyster fail!? oops) which are only $1 a pop after 5pm.   I did try a scallop ceviche appetizer and the pork belly entree. Both were amazing.   The ceviche was served over a flat plate rather than in a cup, the scallops were sliced thin and had a nice acidity, topped with a thin slice of lardo (Italian cured salami) for balance.  I can never resist pork belly and the entree here at Biff's did not disappoint. It was very tender and not overly fatty.  Bonus points for Biff's because you can get a carafe of wine here. (Too many places only serve by either glass or bottle).  Service was great at Biff's, although we did seem to have quite a few different staff coming to the table rather than just a single waiter."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious dinner with my boyfriend on the weekend. Although this restaurant is part of the O&B family, I think its quite a high quality restaurant.  Summerlicious dinner ($38) For starters I had the marinated seafood salad was really tasty. There was a decent amount of seafood - the mussels and calamari were fresh ingredients. The calamari were soft but slightly chewy. I had the herb and mustard crusted pork tenderloin for the main. This was amazing! The pork meat was cooked just right, super tender and juicy, not dry at all. The mustard crust were along the ends of the pork adding a nice crunch and kick in flavor in each bite. Caramelized pineapple upside down cake for dessert, served with vanilla ice cream. The cake was good, not too sweet, but tasted really good adding ice cream in each bite.  Foie Gras du Jour ($21) The way they serve foie gras depends on the chef's daily inspiration. I found that was pretty neat. Expensive for a 3 piece appetizer, but it was really deliciosu! We had the foie gras spread served in a puff pastry, topped on a goat cheese spread and raspberry dressing. The foie gras was really good, rich in flavor! It doesn't look obvious but there's actually a perfect amount of foie gras inside the puff complementing each other. The goat cheese spread was really creamy and adds extra flavor to the puffs."}
{"text":"An ultimate favourite of mine!  A TO staple visit!  Biff's always never fails! You can't go wrong with a buck a shuck after 5pm!  An amazing deal and they're simple and tasty!    Chef Amanda Ray always prepares her menu with thought and love.  I'm always torn when I have to order my meal at Biffs.  But now that I have moved out West, I have to be even more picky!    I headed to Biffs for a special occasion - my birthday!  A group of 8 of us had a reservation and were seated promptly as we arrived.  Our server graced us with the evening's specials and we decided to order from the regular menu.  We had a selection of starters from salads to pig's ears!    Our mains ranged from the duck to the beef bourginon.  EVERYONE was pleased with their choices and the flavours were amazing as always.  A nice birthday treat ended the meal along with a couple of baskets of the warm madeleines.  Always me favourite!  Oh Biffs!  I miss you ... and will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a-okay in my books. Buck a shuck oyster night is definitely the highlight for me. Whenever we go we order dozens and dozens of oysters always worrying that they will run out but they never do. The oysters they have on special are always fresh and tasty.   Their wine list offers a great selection if wines by the glass and by the bottle.   Service is too notch.   From the menu, appetizer wise both the steak tartare and marrow bone are great choices. The description could lead you to believe that the bone marrow is both the marrow and beef cheek, but it is really beef cheek mixed into the marrow. I wish there was more marrow.   The duck confit is decent and as their fries are quite tasty I asked to sub the fries for what did not seem that interesting to me. They accommodated and I was a very happy camper."}
{"text":"Why bother update with same stars you may wonder. I want to let others know it's consistent... consistently average food, but with good service & atmosphere (with exception to the bathrooms, which I feel could use either a more thorough clean or new floor tiles & paint touch ups). I had the chicken liver parfait again, which was thankfully good as the last time, although I found the melba toasts were WAY too hard (so heads up if you're the least bit concerned about your dental work).  My friend had the mussels - they were fine. I had the flat iron steak frites. My bad, I should've known more about that cut, that it shouldn't be cooked mid-rare or it's chewy. (I just can't bring myself to order steak more done than that, but in this case maybe medium would've combated the toughness).  Now, the server was wonderful and offered to replace it, but I let it go since it was my naiveté. The frites (aka skinny fries) were a bit cold, and over-salted. I know one should not complain about too much, but seriously, this is not fast food and I don't need a triple serving of fries that occupies more than half the plate. My big dissapointment was the Lemon Tarte. The pastry was way too thick and not flaky. There was about the same thickness of the lemon curd (1/4\") as there was pastry. It was kinda smallish, about a 3\" round. If there had been more curd and less pastry, the portion size would've been fine.  My friend had the ice cream and she said it was nice, but I think it's hard to screw up ice cream.  Maybe next time, I'll go for something more 'common' or safe like the bourguingon. Stew can't possibly be screwed up can it? Sigh... each time I eat here, I wonder \"would Michael Bonacini really approve of this food?\"...  As before, I would return for the location and service."}
{"text":"Met a friend from out of town here for dinner one night and had a pretty good experience. The décor was typical for what you would expect for a restaurant attracting a more corporate crowd. I liked it though, not overdone or stuffy but very modern and clean.   I've been here before and I thought it was average but it was better this time.  Our waitress was great, helped us choose a delicious bottle of wine and went on to make recommendations for the menu.   I had the soup to start which was good, piping hot which I liked and very flavourful without being too rich.   The trout was okay. The fish was fresh and cooked nicely but it was a tad on the bland side.  The chocolate cake was really, really good. It was my favourite part of the meal and I would go back just for the dessert.   I also heard that they have some sort of special on oysters but only at random times so I didn't get to try that out. I would definitely try this place again to see if the oysters are any good :)    Overall, solid restaurant that you won't go wrong with and I would recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Just finished a Summerlicious three course dinner. What a wonderful joint with beautiful decor, ambience and a knowledgable staff (ask for Elizabeth). She makes great cocktails too :) The Chicken parfait is flavorful and rich, definitely worth a try. I had the pork medallion and each component in the dish had a taste to it which was distinct yet contributed to the overall appeal of the dish.   To finish off the warm pineapple upside down cake with in house Vanilla bean ice-cream cannot be beat.  Also, their mustard has a unique flavor and I was told it is made in house too."}
{"text":"I am officially a Fan of O&B chains.  I never liked corporate big restaurants such SirCorp (Jack Astors, Alice Fazoolis) or Cara (Milestone, Swiss Chalet). Working in one I know it's all uneducated cooks in the back that never took a single course in culinary before.   Biff's would be the second 3rd O&B restaurant experience and I was completely blown away. The decor is upscale and cozy, but casual enough so you don't have to be rdiculously over dressed for dinner.  After 5pm they offer buck a shuck. That's right. $1 oysters. You won't get an extended list to choose from but offering that in the middle of the financial district is a steal!  Aside from the buck-a-suck. They also offer 3 courses for 33$. Their single course entree is already 25$, so for just over 5$, you get a soup, salad, or foie gras, and a dessert of your choice.  From my experience what the most memorable part of my meal was the mushroom soup. A definite must try!"}
{"text":"Oyster! $1 an Oyster?! Everyday after 5 pm??!! Now I know where to go for oyster when I have the cravings....  I know Biff's Bistro is not serving up the best oysters in town and you don't really have choice of the fancy oysters but $1??   I tell you I can eat a lot of oyster.. if I going to pig out on oyster at Rodney's I would be in trouble and I might have a heart attack when I see the final bill.........  We ended up sitting by the bar... and the services was good without overbearing... and I like the deco and the vibe of the Biff's...  but how many oysters can I down in one seating?! It can be quite scary :P"}
{"text":"I came here for winnerlicious. Everything was just perfect. Nice place to have a good meal with family or friends. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great choice for pre or post theatre if you're seeing a show at Sony Centre.  Literally steps from the front entrancr, Biff's provides French bistro classics  well.  Oddly enough we kept being sent food that had not ordered though and so did the tables near us , so that was idd and the reason for only delivering a 3 star.   The prix fixed menu is a great choice if you want to try out the menu a bit but the bar menu specials look great if you want to stop of for drinks pre show too!"}
{"text":"A group of 6, including myself, dined here on New Year's Eve and were unimpressed with Biff's as an overall experience. Where the restaurant saves itself is in the quality of the food but we have simply come to expect a lot more from an O&B restaurant.   First, the prix fixe menu for NYE did not make any sense. It was priced at $75 for 3 courses plus an amuse bouche. However, none of the items on the prix fixe were not also on the a la carte menu, and no matter what combination we tried to make, nothing came out to more $75. The prix fixe menu seemed to be kind of a rip off, so we all ordered a la carte. I had the escargots and the Lobster Newburg, which were both tasty, no complaints about that.  The problem began already when we walked in, when the hostess noted that coat check was \"full\", even though we saw that people were leaving with their coats we arrived. Two members of our party were able to check in their coats, but the rest of us were inexplicably left out in the cold (or the opposite, if there's a pun to be intended). We sat in a booth so we had to leave our pile of parkas (it was very cold that evening) next to us, which isn't per se a problem, but in a restaurant where my entree is almost $50, I would expect less dismissiveness from the hostess.  Our server, while very nice and while he profusely apologized, was also very slow. It took a good 10-15 minutes before we were even asked about drink orders, by which time we had already all decided on what we wanted to order for food. We also had a party of 6 but the serving manner was all over the place, with our food being passed over our heads and us expecting to basically serve the platters to ourselves.   Overall, food was very good but service was beyond subpar for a place this calibre. If I wanted to dine at Jack Astor's, I would have chosen Jack Astor's."}
{"text":"This place seems to thrive on its name alone. Out of the 4 steaks our table ordered, 3 were way undercooked. Medium wells should not be bleeding. I'm guessing they just made them all rare. The fries were way too salty as well and the dessert forgettable."}
{"text":"This is a nice French restaurant - I came here on a Friday afternoon and had lunch on their patio.   Service was quick and friendly. They only brought the bread upon request - our party expected that this would be done on its own. The bread was warm and tasty, and the butter melted on the bread. So it was good that we asked.   I had the calf liver (done medium well) and it was delicious. The liver wasn't dry but was also tender. The liver was on a bed of vegetables which complemented the meal well.   Later that week, I attended a social at Biffs with wine/beer and hors d'ouevres. The lamb burger was tasty and quite messy for a small snack. The chicken balls were average - a bit too much dough/batter for my liking. Their best hors d'oeuvre was the seared scallop.   Great place to catch up or host a social!"}
{"text":"came here for oysters during happy hour. cheap oysters, but they don't come with sides sauces, only lemon, dry horseradish and some vinaigrette. the oysters were small, and the service was slow. we were in the bar area, and were one of 2 tables. when she did come to the table she kept on trying to get us to order off the menu."}
{"text":"I came here with about 5 or 6 friends for drinks, Buck a Shuck oysters and frites (come on, they're fries!).  The oysters were good, the frites were crisp, but seeing that we wouldn't be racking up a huge bill, the wait staff did not go out of their way to be overly friendly.  Otherwise, the decor was quite nice, the seats were comfortable, the food good.  Was tempted to come back for dinner to try the entrees, but judging by the less than lukewarm response from other yelpers I'm not too sure if I'd be so keen!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located, but our meal was only average. We stayed in the private room and the room was pretty cool with the map of paris drawn through wire.  I had the 3 course for $33, mushroom soup to start followed by artic char, and creme brulee. Well priced, but nothing really hit me.  The nice part is they have $1 oysters after 5pm. The oysters that night came from PEI. I was quite full after the meal, but managed to sneak in a few early on. When we came in, they have a chalk board counting down the oysters. 700 that night, and 0 upon leaving~~ kind of cool~~"}
{"text":"Biff Bistro is my last O & B restaurant to try, so I decided to stop by for a weekend lunch. Biff Bistro offers a lunch prix fixe combo, which comes with the soup of your choice.   I wasn't tempted by the soup of the day (some sort of bean soup), so I opted for the mushroom soup instead.  The hearty soup was rich with robust, earthy flavours.   For the main, I decided to try Basquez style chicken with preserved lemon, olives and chorizo. The dish was visually stunning, and I was immediately drawn to the bright, vibrant colours. Luckily, the taste did not disappoint either. The chicken was very tender and the broth was bursting with flavours of the meat juice and herbs.   I wasn't very impressed with the caramelized onion tartlette with warm mushrooms, anchovy and grand crème delin. The pastry itself was slightly too thick and hard, particularly in the bottom. I also wished that the anchovy had been more evenly distributed throughout the tart. The large chunks of cured fish made certain bites overly salty.   All in all, it was a very enjoyable lunch, and I really loved the chicken! However, I think I prefer O & B Cafe Grill and Jump over Biff's Bistro."}
{"text":"2.5  to be honest, I have not had much of their food here. Just a soup and app a long time ago, maybe summerlicious but it wasn't too memorable. So maybe it is better and maybe their food is good...this is a narrow review.  The most memorable part of the times (3 to be exact) that I have been here was the buck a shuck night. Sad to say but for the amount of oyster you get (super duper small), its like the regular price of 3-4$ an oyster but only 1$ worth in size. So it may as well have been regular oyster night. Too bad for all the effort in them shucking such tiny oysters.  Could have been just that night but no thanks to another night."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at Biff's Bistro during the most recent Winterlicious. I found the atmosphere captivating, and the service very friendly and professional. My wife and I opted in for the drink pairing, and were blown away by the quality of the food. Very succulent."}
{"text":"Fantastic place on all counts. Their Summerlicious menu was top notch and so it their own pre-fix menu that they offer every day. I would disagree that the food is expensive - their entree are in the usual range of good restaurants. If you want to spend $26 on 5 dinners, you can only go to McDonald's me thinks :) Great service, friendly staff - can I point out I also loved the decor? :)"}
{"text":"After the great flood of Valentines Day in 2016, we were fortunate to come here again after they reopen..  We were lured by the Buck a Shuck again and this time we sat in the Bar/Lounge side. We were also tempted by the #Dirty Bits (Special Happy Hour items for $7)  Along with 5 dozen Buck a Shuck Oysters, we had:  Dirty Poutine - lamb kofta, cheese curds, lamb jus, harissa drizzle We ordered the first one and it was so good, we ordered it again, unfortunately, the chef at the back forgot the best part, lamb bits, so we had to send it back, they were really good about it and made us a third one and comp it. - Good customer service all around  Fish, Chip and Pickle - this was disappointing, it was literally 3 pieces of bite size fish and 4 potato chips  On the recommendation of our bartender, we also ordered the Giant Duck Wings - it was very tasty deep fried with a maple glaze. This item was also $7 but was not on the menu.  The drinks were a great value also. We had the Vesper Martini and Goose Island Honker Ale (14oz) both for $7 each  We also ordered the small size Beef Tartar, which was only ok, I think the chef forgot to add the egg yolk as it was really dry. (This was more than $7, I forgot how much it it)  Since it was the first week of re-opening, the kitchen needs some seasoning but all in all, the Dirty Bits & Booze is a good value.  We will return again.."}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto, we happened upon this lovely bistro and sat at a table in the bar. Our waitress was less than friendly but our soup du jour - a cold cucumber soup, Caesar salad, chicken supreme au pistou, and bread basket were outstanding! I will go again because of the food- unfortunately not the service."}
