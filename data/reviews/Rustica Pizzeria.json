{"text":"Great food, great staff, excellent pizza that is mouthwatering! The servers are so nice and friendly and helpful. You cannot beat their customer service, so so great! I have been to other pizza places in the area and they are by far the best! Very nice, very clean, food is always hot! Best place to go for pizza!"}
{"text":"The owner asked me to never come back, all over a slice of chocolate cake. I was really craving chocolate and already had dinner, my husband wanted pizza. We decided to try Rustic and was disappointed. We ordered A medium pizza that was ok, but the crust was very dry. Garlic cheesy bread was great. Ordered two sodas that were almost warm when our food was delivered and they forgot my chocolate cake! So much for using a delivery service. My advice, maybe try someplace else. I sent a message to the business that did reply and credited my account for the cake, I appreciated that, but why pay for a service, and tip, if my order was wrong anyway? I might as well have saved the money and gone somewhere else.

Then, the manager reaches out and says he's sorry I gave him a poor review. The owner reached out to me and asked me to never dine w them again because of this review. That's a pretty big statement and says a lot about this business."}
{"text":"I have lived in Vegas for 13 years. I am very picky with my pizza coming from the east coast. We are in love with this place! Fresh, delicious pizza. The Philly cheesesteak pizza is my favorite!  My kids love the chicken and fries. Generous portions, clean and great staff! Our family's new favorite!
Update: still loving this amazing place!! From New England.. Miss the pizza and food so much.. But this place makes me feel like I still live there. If your from the east coast and miss great food.. This is the place to eat. Read the reviews again and had to comment yet again. Being in retail for so much of my life, you can't please everyone. Thank you Rustica for being so amazing. Our family isn't a fast food family, but we love you."}
{"text":"Good pizza and the garlic knots were very good. Nice to find a place close to the house that's actually worth going to. I eat here for lunch often and it's always good."}
{"text":"The food is good but not worth the bad service when they get your order wrong. My order was wrong & instead of being apologetic & replacing it, they only replaced half the order.  After waiting 45min for the driver.  I called back & requested my money back.  Once the driver arrived he told me i would either get a refund or my food not both also was very rude about it.  It was only after convincing him to call the manager who approved the refund, he said very rudely \"here's your $9\". And took off.  Only visit this poor excuse of a food joint if you want rude service if THEY mess up your order."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced pizza and beer. My wife and I had a medium Mikey's favorite and a couple of Miller Lites each and the bill was only about $28 total.  The pizza could have been a little hotter but they put it back in the oven for a few minutes and it was fine. Pizza sauce needed a bit more flavor but all in all I was satisfied. Pauline our server was friendly and efficient. The only other issue, and it's minor, is the napkins are a bit thin so you have to use more of them. Will go again."}
{"text":"Visited this place a couple times while vacationing since it was near our hotel - great food and service! The pizza crust is done to perfection with a golden brown crispy crust on the bottom while still being a bit soft on the top, which I love. I recommend the Bombay which is a curry chicken pizza with pineapple. (It sounds odd at first, but it's delicious!) My husband liked the German beer they had on tap. I tried the Radler which is beer mixed with sprite - different but I really liked it. We both loved the tiramasu, too. The next time we're in town, we'll be visiting again."}
{"text":"DO NOT CONSUME FOOD HERE. You've been warned. Came here for a second time, the first time was a take out order and I did not see them preparing the food. This second time was a nightmare. I observed the woman preparing the food with her bare non-washed hands. When I pointed it out the man at the front got very defensive!

I let it go and continued to wait but saw her touching meat products and then touching other products all while not washing her hands once. Me being a vegetarian my fear of cross contamination kicks in and I again speak up to the man working the counter only to then notice a DIRTY damp towel laying right next to the loafs of bread I ordered for my eggplant sandwiches. The man goes on to throw the bread in the trash and puts on gloves to give me new bread (all while not washing his hands first after he had just taken a cash payment from another customer) so at this point we are both frustrated with each other I'm sure. 

I then ask if he could kindly clean the space he was attempting to prepare my food at as it was clearly and obviously filthy. This place does not clean after each order. Truthfully I don't think they clean at all. Needless to say I will not be dining here again.

Oh but I'm not done, after I asked him to clean the space he then tells me he was not going to do that and that he would give me a refund because the health inspectors come to inspect their business. Clearly they were not observing the same things I was. I expect my food to be prepared with clean hands at the very least if I'm choosing to spend my money on your food. A sanitary space to prepare my food would be even better. 

The man was very angry and upset that I called him out instead of apologizing and making the proper corrections. He rather lose a customer then own up to the fact that the kitchen and the cooks are very unsanitary."}
{"text":"Love this place. Was in Las Vegas and stumbled upon this gem. My wife and I are big pizza fans. This place has great pizza and atmosphere. Our pizza was delicious and hot! The crust which they make daily was perfect, and the toppings were fresh and generous. The place itself was spotless, the bathrooms were some of the cleanest I've ever seen at restaurant. The employees were kind and very attentive. We will definitely come back to sunset pizza on our next trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Ordered from here twice now and enjoyed the food both times. Onion rings could be cooked a little longer so they're crispy rather than soft. This last time we got the Philly cheese steak pizza which was good, but we thought it would be better w/o red sauce. Maybe use no sauce, or white sauce, or even some cheese wiz (real Philly style). Either way we'll keep going back when the urge hits us."}
{"text":"We showed up right at closing time. They were so nice to stay open and accept my Restaurant.com certificate. We enjoyed a veggie pizza, meat Stromboli and a Chef's salad. All really good. Not great but good. But very considerate and thoughtful staff."}
{"text":"A friend is in town and we decided to eat in.  We ordered a pizza at Rustica.  It wasn't bad, but, there was no flavor.  The sausage was the only flavor.   The crust was dry.  Little to no cheese.  Minimal sauce.   It took me a while to figure it out.  Flavorless."}
{"text":"Bland everything here.  The pizza isn't terrible, but its certainly not good.  I've only ever eaten here when my friends were already going, or when my work bought the food.  The pizza is definitely consistent, but consistently slightly below mediocre.  I wish a better pizza place was in this location."}
{"text":"Food here is top notch. Best NY style pizza in Las Vegas hands down. The way Anh makes the dough to Rosie being a amazing Waitress you can't go wrong here! They deliver also and always super fast, hot, and on time. Have never had any problems going here and will continue to come back and so should you reading this!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great prices.  Only minor complaint is that they will tell you 20 min for a pick up pizza, and always ends up being 35-40 min.  But it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food is great but pretty much cold when it got here. Delivery guy got agitated when we didnt tip due to cold food."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times now. I enjoy this pizza more than any other in Las Vegas right now!  They have awesome chicken wings also.   I really enjoy the crust, so nice and crisp deliciousness.  My favorite pizza is the white pizza with feta :-) 

The place is nice with the kitchen up where you can see it. Owners are always friendly and there! They make sure your taken care of right. The personal touch is always nice! 

Nicely clean restaurant with a few TVs make this pizzeria a good place to go catch a football game here soon! 

They offer delivery too but I enjoy dinning in. I highly suggest getting a bit to eat here. They have everything a pizzeria should; pasta, salad, cannoli, gelato, pizza, a full menu.  I have been enjoying the pizza so much I haven't tried a pasta dish yet but I will next time and come back and let you know what I think but I have seen some others had and oh boy they look NICE."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I had fond memories of Mama Lugi's pizza that used to occupy the same space so I was looking forward to continuing that.

A  friend of mine and I went there and ordered a 1 topping pizza and chicken fingers combo for lunch.  
 
Their pizza is a thin New York style crust which is my personal favorite pizza type. When the pizza came and I picked up a slice, I had to tilt it to the side to let the pepperoni juice slide off my piece. Greasy

The chicken fingers we ordered kind of fell flat as well. The breading was hard, even with the sauce on it and was a bit crunchy for my taste. The buffalo sauce also was put on very hastily so there was dry parts on some of the fingers and the sauce was coming apart in the bottom of the basket. More Greasy.

On a positive note, the people working there were very nice and the food came out really quick but it didn't make up for the food."}
{"text":"I go here because they are Close to where I live I usually order the large with mushrooms  and black olives. service is alright  food is not bad they screwed up on my order a few times but what the heck it is a pizza joint we still go back we support our local business owners! :-)"}
{"text":"Nice dine-in pizza place!  I came with my husband and kids and everyone enjoyed it.  The pizza was definitely NY style - it had a thin crust (soft but crispy on outside), cheese and sauce were just the right amount. Staff was friendly.  We will definitely come again."}
{"text":"I came here with the family for the first time. I am giving  it a five star because the service, food and atmosphere are great. Our server was Stacy and she did a phenomenal job, for that reason alone we will definitely come back. Stacy, offer us a special that we did not even know about and ended it up saving some money. Than you!!!"}
{"text":"Don't know what's going on here but the service and food used to be top notch - not so much anymore. Ordered two gluten free pizzas and a bucket of wings for pick up. I show up 15 minutes late and the pizzas aren't ready. So I wait 10 minutes and they go to box it up and one of the pizzas is MIA. I can see the staff looking for the second pizza and then I see one of the cooks pulling a GF pizza dough out to make the missing pie and I almost flip. You've got to be kidding, right?!? Now I'm supposed to wait another 20 minutes?!? No, don't think so. I told the staff to forget it, I'm done, credit me the missing pie and give me my food. I've got kids waiting at home. So they credit me $20 for the missing pie and a little extra for the wait. I was not happy but I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, this was the third time in a row they've messed up my order. To add insult to injury, the cost of a bucket of wings went from $22 to $34. I looked online at the Sunset website before ordering and learned upon arrival that 'Sunset Pizzeria' is now 'Rustica Pizzeria' with a new menu and new, higher prices. Diners be warned. 

Heads up to the pizzeria staff - while there is no expectation that a gluten free pizza served in a regular pizzeria is truly gluten free, once you've placed a gluten free crust on a wheat flour coated prep table you've completely contaminated the gluten free crust."}
{"text":"Sunset is consistent which with food is important. It's always a good pizza and hits the spot. Their prices are very reasonable. So you pizza Hut, Dominos, and God forbid Papa Johns people. Please give them a try. Get off your corporate trucked in dough and try some fresh local food."}
{"text":"Ooops.. made the mistake of making an order from this place after being ignored when I came into the restaurant..  2 hours later no show"}
{"text":"I'm Italian and lived in NY (NYC not Buffalo or something) for 25 years.  After moving out here recently, I was disgusted with all of the pizza that people have recommended to me.  Sunset is exceptional, especially for Vegas standards.  They have a $9.99 pickup special for a large cheese pizza and I urge everyone to try it.  Dough, sauce, and mozzarella live up to New York standards and blow everything that exists out here out of the water.  If you like Domino's, you probably won't appreciate this place."}
{"text":"We get Pizza delivered to our home from this place at least twice a month. Our son is allergic to gluten and this place has a great gluten free pizza.
It is always yummy and always fast."}
{"text":"we order cheese pizza and sometimes their cheese garlic bread

both are delish and the pizza is perfect every time! NY style just like we like it :)

we use eat24.com to order and get their delivery 

had a great experience with a local business so I had these guys deliver them a huge lunch to them today 12/7/12

hope they liked it as much as we do :)"}
{"text":"Very nice small place for outstanding pizza, the best I have had since I moved to Vegas from Europe. Everything is fresh and the taste is great! I will stop by again definitely for more! I recommend this place to everybody. If you you go there order the garlic nots as an appetizer they are really good!"}
{"text":"We are new to the area and we were looking for our go-to pizza place. We found it here at Rustica! The pizza and chicken fingers are great!
The whole family agrees! We've ordered a few times now and great every time!"}
{"text":"I had penne ala vodka which is by far my favorite sauce ever. Pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. I should've had them add chicken or prosciutto but it was yummy. The garlic focaccia bread was perfect and great for dipping and cleaning your plate with. My fiancé had a philly cheese steak with peppers and onions. He said it was dry but he loved the cheese and bacon fries. We will have to go once I'm all recovered from my surgery to eat there. It's hard to get an accurate idea of how a good a place is through delivery. They're almost always better when you dine in so I may edit this down the road."}
{"text":"Great local pizzeria. Solid pizza. Fantastic mozzarella sticks that are lightly deep fried compared to other places. Accepts btc. Clean inside. Quick service."}
{"text":"Never ordering from here again. Forced to give driver over a 55% tip. Who sends a delivery driver with no change knowing the customer is paying cash."}
{"text":"Ate inside for lunch. The food was good and hot. Great portions. Tables with armless chairs."}
{"text":"If you're ever wondering what to eat and can't decide, just come here!
The owners are cool, the menu has tons to choose from and the beers are ICE cold to soothe any pallet!
It's my go to when I want something reasonably priced and comforting. 
Tony S"}
{"text":"We are regulars here. They have something to make everyone happy. My vegetarian daughter loves the veggie calzone. My carnivorous teenaged son loves the fingers and wings.  My man loves the crispy tasty thin crust meat lovers pizza.  The zeppoles with raspberry sauce is a treat.  Great place for a family.  The staff is on top of their game...and very kind and accommodating."}
{"text":"As new residents to the Las Vegas area with unpacking behind up and still in front of us, we were tired and hungry. Alas hungry new residents,\"Lets have pizza.\" Long story short, pizza plus salad, plus hot wings, plus bigger salad. Order in we patiently waited for our new found pizza place to deliver our food.

On to serious critique: salads, great with ample amount of dressing. Hot wings tasty but could have been hotter and bigger. OK Drum roll please, PIZZA!!! Great crust, bread, dough, whatever you want to call it. It was good! Next up sauce, really good tomato and spice mix. Good combo to crust. Ingredients, pepperoni not greasy. Sausage same. Veggies tasty.  The delivery was in good time with friendly. That's it for me."}
{"text":"Has to be the worst pizzeria in Las Vegas. Was there tonight. Food was horrible and inedible and the waitress was atrocious. If you are planning to eat here keep on driving."}
{"text":"Found this little Pizza place on the way back from shopping at Ikea. Stopped in with my mom for the lunch special. What a great place!! The pizza was excellent and the service was phenomenal! I highly recommend! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"March 2015 Review (deleted old review of Sunset Pizza as it is no longer at this location). Very nice restaurant, awesome service - beautiful looking pizza pie -- but we tried it twice (after first  take-out was too salty) and gave it another whirl in-house, it was also too salty..  Don't know why, don't know how -- but if the pizza wasn't so salty - would give this place five stars.  Great crust, excellent sauce, value and service.   Truly a nice neighborhood pizza place -- but lose the salty cheese or whatever you changed up to."}
{"text":"Great pizza and the garlic knots will not disappoint! 
Seriously though how did I just head about this place it's awesome! I will defiantly be coming back."}
{"text":"We have ordered from here a couple of times and enjoyed it both times. The pesto pasta was good. It could use some veggies, but maybe we can ask for it next time. The greek salad was also good. The baguette it came with was really good. Im not a fan of their garlic bread but my husband thinks its ok. The only downside so far has been their dessert. We've tried their tiramisu (kinda soggy), zeppole and cheesecake. Nothing special. Otherwise, its one of our go to take out spots."}
{"text":"We had a regular good old fashioned Pepperoni Pizza and it was perfect...just enough sauce and toppings and big enough to do the \"fold over\"!  It took me back to the corner pizza places in Brooklyn.  My husband had a Stromboli that was just as yummy!  Then, to make the entire meal perfect...a canoli to die for!  So glad they deliver and are just around the corner!  We will definitely be visiting this pizza place over and over again!!  And the owners are wonderful and friendly....make you feel like family!"}
{"text":"I'm pissed! This is my favorite pizza place (I tell all my neighbors about it) but tonight I got a pizza and half the pizza was slid off into the box...I understand the drive had a few turns. When I called and told them about it they offered me another pizza free of charge. That was great, but...when the delivery man got to my house he asked for my \"faulty\" pizza in exchange. I'd already given the good half to my kid to eat so they were negotiating for the bad half...I've worked and continue to work for restaurants for 15 years. I dont understand.... You gave me a crap product. Suck it up. The \"manager\" was incredibly rude. The pizza and sub's are great, the management is not. Take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great pizza,Best in the area. Salads are very good. Loved the Greek fries. The people are very friendly"}
{"text":"I miss when this place used to be Mama Luigi's.  I've been here twice since it has been Sunset Pizzeria and although the menu is still very similar... the customer service and food are just not that great.  I was not impressed when our server told us that we could get our own drinks at the drink station, and then two minutes later a group of guys comes in and she takes their drink order and brings it over to them.  Granted, the drink station is not that far away.  But, if drinks are self service, should't they be for everyone?  At the end of our experience, our bill was $50 for 3 calzones and drinks.  I just do not feel that it was worth that much!"}
{"text":"I can say I was thoroughly impressed with my visit here to Sunset Pizzeria. I was doing an oil change down the street and pizza sounded good so I trekked up the block in 104 degree weather to come into this nice mom and & pops store. 

I ordered the Greek and Sunset slices. They were huge slices and the ingredients were all fresh and tasty. I was there to do some business as well and they offered to help me reheat the pizza since I got engrossed in my work. I would recommend this place to anyone trying to get some good local pizza!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic.  The crust is top notch, the restaurant is clean and the workers are friendly.  The lady who greeted us came to our table 3x and interacted with my daughter.  They became friends.  It was just an awesome experience and the pizza was great.   Thin crust, nice and chewy, cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"So the owner sent me an email which he honored my coupon even though I was really okay with it. I felt like the firat time I tried this place and the discount was off that it was really my fault and as I said before the food was so good I didnt mind one bit. But still they gave me another discount so I decided to go on my break from work and  I bought a pizza and more garlic bread and brought it back to work I shared some with my coworkers and everyone was satisfied.  This will be the place we all order pizza from now on!!"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying the food was delicious. We ordered the bruschetta appetizer & white spinach pizza for dinner -- loved them both. The bruschetta was fresh and came on thick slices of bread that wasn't so crunchy it was cutting your mouth. The pizza was the best part of course. Not too thin, but not too thick. Only thing that could have been better was the customer service. The lady waiting the table area was friendly, but the lady at the register where you first order seemed bothered by us coming in at 8:15 for dine in when they close at 9. We almost felt as if we were inconveniencing them because of her demeanor & how she made sure to mention the kitchen takes last orders at 8:30 & questioned again if we wanted dine in. We had our pizza at the table by 8:35 & we're walking out the door a few minutes before 9 (the table that came in before us was still sitting there while we were leaving) so I didn't really understand what felt like emphasized concern on closing times. Other than that, it was a good experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"I rly rly dislike leaving negative reviews and don't even want to. I tried Sunset twice, for me to order pizza is kind of a special deal, lived here a yr and have only done so twice. I order my kids the cheese pizza and ordered myself hot wings and the anti pasta salad. Their pizza was just  so so, yummy crust, but that is all. My hot wings were just gross, soggy and WERE NOT SPICY and had no red sauce on them. If they had run out then call and say so, ill gladly find something else to order. The minimal amount of franks hot sauce they did add, was watery and nasty. The salad as what happened the first time I ordered from here was overly oily and it wasn't really anti pasta just a salad. No banana peppers no pickled veggies, just lettuce and far too much tomato. 

bummed I used my cheat meal night once again on this place and wasn't even worth it.

Up your game guys!!"}
{"text":"This place has stolen our hearts, with their comfort food, family oriented service and their European hospitality... oh and their German beer.  Coming here reminds us of our local pizza Kneipe, (pub), in Germany where everyone knows you, knows your likes and dislikes and greets you with a nice cold beer and honestly wants to know how you are doing. A hidden gem and a continuous delight to walk in and feel right at home.  If you are looking for the nostalgia of a European nonchalant neighborhood hangout, Rustica is the place.  Danke! Grazie Mille!"}
{"text":"Started good, the place wasnt busy, thought we would be in/out. However to no avail our calzone was like hard heated stale bread that i wouldnt feed a pigeon with. The worst bit...they knew they burnt the Calzone, which had way too many onions and tried to serve anyway....really did u honestly think we wouldn't know this thing was horribly over cooked especially by the look of it and when ur cook (who was enjoying his lunch) saying, oh my god, after u went and checked on it? Why would u even think it was okay to serve and try to sheepishly payback $5? 
The replacement was also overcooked. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I honestly haven't been inside this place but I've been ordering their food for delivery. After the first time I've tried it, I've been repeatedly ordering from them instead of my regular places. Their pizza and pasta are amazing, and their prices are reasonable. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Saw the discount on Yelp for this place and thought I would try it out. Cheese and topping weren't cooked/melted all the way but the crust was so hard. Also the cheese pizza we ordered was pepperoni :/"}
{"text":"My partner and I got really sick. Had pizza delivered, came cold."}
{"text":"My first time here after seeing the menu at the car wash up the street; it's kinda late and I'm not up for fast food so I thought I'd give it a try. 

When I got inside the place was pretty empty - just one guy sitting at a table - but it was already 8:45 and they close at 9 (sign says).  I knew I wanted to get my food to go and get home so no big deal. I was greeted by a gentleman who told me someone would be right with me; after a minute a lady came over to take my order.  Places my order with no problem and went to sit down.  As I turned around a couple came in to sit down to eat and they were promptly told \"we're closed!\"  This is kind of a turnoff for me - the hours say 9, the open sign is still lit.  I've been a server before and always hate that last table that arrives 1 minute before closing time, but it's the service industry life - you take care of people. It sucks but you never know - could be a great tip, could become regulars, could mean that when people see others in your store then more start to come in and join them. 

On to my food....  it came out quickly - less than 10 minutes wait. I ordered the spicy meatball Parmesan grinder and a small antipasto salad with the \"homemade ranch.\"  The grinder had 4 giant meatballs that are either really homemade or they're really good convenience product. The sandwich is cut on top and stuffed rather than split down the side, keeping by the sauce and meatballs in place. 

The small antipasto salad was adequate for two people and topped with pepperoncini, sliced black olives, tomatoes, cucumber, sliced red onion (way too many onions!!) and a stack of deli meat and cheese. It was ok, certainly nothing special. There was probably one or two slices of each meat and a little provolone cheese, rolled up and then kinda sorta sliced - but not cut through so it really just felt like a giant string of meat.  It needed more cheese, and would have been better if the meat was a little thicker to give it that meaty consistency. The lettuce was iceberg - nice and crispy - but way too wet. I appreciate that they washed it, but the bottom of my salad was swimming in water. 

All in all I'd go back. I'll let you know how I like it next time."}
{"text":"I'm regular customer who come here everyday and love there pizza, salad and pasta is delicious. Great friendly staff."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time this Friday night! It was really good! They should advertise their cheesesteaks because their cheesesteak meat is really good! I got the cheesesteak Stromboli and it was AMAZING! 
I suggest you should get their cheesesteak! I never had a pizza from here, but I assume they are also good! 
Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed this place food is good not over prices always friendly. I recommend giving it a shot if looking for a pizza place"}
{"text":"Great pizza for a very reasonable rate!

Sunset Pizzeria has always provided delicious food and anytime there has even been a slight issue they've fixed the problem and made us happy :)

I don't ask for perfection all the time, I just want the place to care about their customers, have a quality product, and fix any problems that arise.

I definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the area and want some tasty pizza :)"}
{"text":"This Place rocks. Came here in the morning to just have a desert and coffee. I had their homemade tiramisu and no kidding: it was the best I have ever had. A little bit on the pricey side but it is absolute killer. Really nice people. I will be back to try their pizza and pasta soon."}
{"text":"This used to be Mama Luigi's Pizza place.  I used to come here often back then.  Tried their pizza.  It was bland. I expected some tangy spicy tomato sauce and adding the peppers didn't help either. I also ordered HOT chicken wings.  The wings not so hot.  It was more of a mild taste.  When I say HOT, I want my lips to be burning.  I don't think I'll be back here."}
{"text":"The cook is so wonderful! This place is definitely a place I visit often when I'm feeling like a good clean atmosphere! Not to mention everything on the menu is AMAZING! Check out this place! They have delivery also so make sure you take a menu home!"}
{"text":"Wow had this delivered and had to chuck it out! So bad everything we had was disgusting and I am sad I waisted my money. Gyro= frozen dog food 
Calzone= oil sponge 
Lasagna= school cafeteria food"}
{"text":"This place is a great place for pizza and burgers! I work near by and they've become my regular go-to. I love having their pepperoni pizza when I'm with company, and even when I dine alone they have a 2 pizza slice combo during lunch for like five bucks and change! And not only are they a great pizza spot, they also make an awesome burger joint! The burgers are huge and relatively inexpensive, and I typically upgrade my fries to a Greek Fries. It's soooo good! It has feta cheese, Greek spice, and lemon! I definitely recommend! :D"}
{"text":"Not only do they close at 9 PM but we were turned away at 8:45 PM.  I worked in the restaurant industry as a server during college and spent more nights than I care to remember staying late as someone walked in close to closing time and we always sat them and fed them.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"This is the one of the best pizzas I have ever had and their garlic knots were very good.  We ordered the sausage, mushroom and garlic.  They use only the freshest of ingredients and you can taste the difference.  We had great and friendly service with the exception of our server charging us for a large pizza when we ordered a medium. However, she did remedy the error and corrected our bill.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! Tried this place today for the first time. Friendly, clean restaurant. I will definitely go back, but next time it won't be for pick-up. It's the quaint little neighborhood place I've been looking for."}
{"text":"We've ordered from here 3 times and each time got a different pizza. Plus we've had the meatball sub. Everything has been great!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've found so far, it's always fresh crispy crust.  They have a great pizza lunch special 2 gigantic slices of pizza and a drink for $5..cant beat that!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Just finished a great meal! The pizza was hot with plenty of cheese. The mozzarella sticks were just kinda OK,  not sure what they were missing.  The zepolie
 made a great desert and the whole meal was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Not the same place it used to be. No beer out, nothing special or friendly. Just another sad little strip mall pizza place. There are other places very close that are much better."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I give this restaurant two stars because of their service. Based on their website they close at 9pm but when I called at 8pm to place an order for delivery the girl told me sorry but they had already closed everything up for the night. If they stopped doing delivery at 8pm then they should state that because there isn't one pizza place that has ever told me they closed everything up an hour before they actually close."}
{"text":"Great location by the house, they are located in Tropicana Plaza. (If you're heading  West on Trop it will be on your right) the plaza just before the Grand Canyon. Where the right turn only lane begins.

 I've tried their Chicken Parmesan without the bun and it's delicious.  My boyfriend loves their calzones he normally gets Ham & cheese for lunch.  We like the how friendly the service is.  Pauline and Chris have quite a gem. It's clean, quiet in the afternoons so it's a great lunch spot. We just enjoy our food and watch TV.

Today (9/8/13) is our 4th time visiting Sunset Pizzeria. We strolled in around 2:30 pm, Pauline was at the register and greeted us with a smile.  I told her I was going to try the gluten free pizza today with Ricotta and Meatball, my favorites.  I was pretty happy to find a place that offers a gluten free crust for a reasonable price. My boyfriend ordered a medium pizza with light sauce, extra cheese, pepperoni and black olives. 

My pizza was 12\" around and with a sprinkle of garlic powder and parm I was chowing down.  I ended up eating most of it and taking the one giant slice home.  That was the best gluten free pizza evah (ever)! The boyfriend was eating his pizza and he turned to me with this huge smirk.  I asked him \"what?\", he said \"this place puts our regular pizza place to shame\".

Ready for the damage? Keeping in mind toppings are 1.25 each, my pizza was $12.49 for a 2 topping gluten free crust, my boyfriend had a 3 topping medium pizza for $14.74, 2 sodas a $1.59 each with free refills. Tax included we spent $32.87 but that's fine because later I won't have any hives from eating pizza!  It was well worth the money and the service.  I took pictures of our pizzas for those of you that are curious."}
{"text":"I don't even normally leave reviews but this place was so horrible and unprofessional I just had to. They messed up an order but I decided to give them another try. What a mistake that was. They totally messed up the order after waiting an hour and a half. I called and they were supposed to replace it but then they called back and said that they changed their mind and wouldn't replace it. Horrible service. My food was all wrong and cold. Then they had the nerve to be rude about it and not even replace it. Don't order from here!

In response to your post which is once again rude. I didn't call to complain that there was no cheese which is actually spelled with two e's by the way. I called to complain because there was lettuce and mayo on it. So you should probably get your facts straight and read the ticket again. And by the way it was most definitely not within 51 minutes as you claim. And your staff just called back to apologize and assumed responsibility so you're just making yourself look even worse. Probably wouldn't have come to this had you not been so rude in the first place. So you should spend less time being rude to customers and more time in the accuracy of your orders and customer service.

And it gets better. The oh so unprofessional owner just called me and said \"I suggest you remove the review from Yelp or else\" and then hung up on me! No wonder why your business is so unprofessional with an owner like that. You just lost a long time customer and hopefully anyone who reads this review will keep looking on Yelp for pizza. This all could've been resolved by being handled appropriately in the first place.

Oh so now you change your comment huh. Too little too late. Once again you're in denial that the hamburger was correct. READ THE TICKET. There was not supposed to be any mayo or lettuce which there was. Now you're lying about your service and your threatening calls. Well I have proof of both. Maybe you should handle yourself appropriately as a businessman and this could actually get resolved."}
{"text":"I really like there chicken Alfredo, a little pricey , but when you're hungry you're hungry . Great place and such a quiet place If you are trying to have a calm lunch without all the craziness of a lunch rush!!"}
{"text":"Super good! Love the crust...perfectly crispy and golden brown (not burnt at all). We asked for extra cheese and they did not skimp... for sausage and pepperoni. It was too good. Definitely I'm my top 5. I will be ordering again"}
{"text":"Just tried Rustica for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised.  Service was friendly, food was tasty and the prices are very reasonable.  They offer more than just pizza, the menu has a great variety of sandwiches, salads, pastas, and pizza of course!  I will be back, this may be my new neighborhood pizzeria - I avoid chain pizza places and until now I couldn't find a local place near me with good pizza.  I found it tonight!"}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was good and the teriyaki wings were also really tasty. There are a ton of local pizzerias in the area and I'd say this is a fairly decent one. Especially using the Yelp deal. You can't really beat $20 worth of food for $10. We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a year or so, mostly gotten delivery. Today I ordered a pickup instead because they said it would take a hour, I didn't want to wait. I was told the wait was 20 minutes for the pick up. When I got there, the girl who I was picking up from seemed to very confused and didn't know where my order was or that I had called in. After being told to wait a few minutes I have reason to believe she gave my pizza away to another customer and so I had to wait about 15 extra minutes like that was the reason I had come to pick up so I wouldn't have to wait any longer, the cheese pizza we ordered had clearly been sitting around and soggy compared to the other pizza and they weren't cut and I had to cut it myself at home. I feel like I don't want to come back here. I like the pizza it's tasty, but this was crappy..."}
{"text":"Ordered a med pizza with bacon and green peppers... They forgot they bacon. 
HOW DO YOU FORGET THE BACON???"}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for delivery, and guy shows up without the coke that was also ordered and paid for. Stated place was closed, and he was sorry....No contact info available on webpage. 

Buyer beware."}
{"text":"This place isn't good. The chicken fingers came from a freezer bag straight into the fryer and had no flavor. The pizza was just ok. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We love this pizza place. Very fresh ingredients and the crust is just right. Thin but not too thin like a cracker. It's very welcoming inside and decorated cute but we've been getting our pizza to go. Good prices too for the size and quality. They run specials as well."}
{"text":"My fiance and i order delivery here all the time and are never disappointed :) food is always wonderful! Delivery is great for days you just dont feel like putting on pants to go anywhere. We've picked up food from here as well & are always treated nicely."}
{"text":"Not terrible, the Greek fries where yummy but the tiramisu was gross especially for $7. The chicken in the Caesar salad was dry and crusty so not overly impressed. I doubt I'll order from here again for the price and quality but I've defiantly had worse."}
{"text":"Fast delivery and hot delicious food. So, we were having one of those lazy days in and decided to get ourselves so delivery. It was our first time ordering from Rustica and I liked it. 

The food came within 30 minutes though the projected time online said 45-60 minutes. Love when the food gets here sooner than expected. Especially when we're starving. 

The pizza was piping hot and oh so cheesy. Love their pizza sauce. Didn't really care for the fried mushrooms because the batter was a bit thick for my liking but I loved my Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich. The beef was tender and flavorful. They filled it up with mushroom, cheese, green bell peppers and onions. Probably one of the better Philly cheesesteaks I've had in a long while. 
And the pizza leftovers were even better the next day! Yep. Love it."}
{"text":"Just not very good. The reviews really said it all but we went here anyway but it just was not good. Pizza is so heavenly; it's such a shame to have a bad one. We were recommended some sort of spinach and ricotta pizza and it had no sauce on it, the spinach tasted like it was murdered, really bland and such a waste of carbs and calories and money. We got a little Hawaiian one too which was decent but truly nothing to write home about. 
The garlic knots on the other hand were pretty damn tasty, but as I speak I have a frozen pizza in the oven because the gross spinach one was just not doable and the little Hawaiian that is decent is too tiny for two ppl and we've still gotta eat."}
{"text":"I really wanted to have faith in this place because it had 4 stars and somewhat good reviews. But unfortunately, I was completely let down. I ordered a pepperoni calzone and it was like biting into a mouth full of mush. I ordered Penne de la Vodka, it wanted to have the perfect taste but it was way to creamy and again, mushy. The garlic bread that came with the pasta was stale and dry. The small salad was honestly the best part but they forgot my dressing (luckily I had my own). Again, I was really looking forward to enjoying this place but my high expectations were shot down. Definitely wasn't worth $56 at all. The delivery guy was nice though."}
{"text":"I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it. The size of the food you get is a huge plus especially when added to the fact that the place has priced its stuff really well. Love the service. It's a pizza place! it really shouldn't be hard and so many places are just so badly done but Sunset is one place I love for its attentive costumer service, fast execution of orders and never an issue with anything. Been here 5 times and am now leaving a review because I feel that they deserve a shout out! As an added bonus, they accept BITCOIN! finally more businesses taking it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Sunset Pizza last night after finding a Restaurant.com coupon we forgot we had.

Great pizza and Tortellini. The service was exceptional. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Only been here once and it was this evening. We were on this side of town and decided to look to online reviews to see what is good and let me tell you what this place is ON POINT! We ordered the Rustica Calzone, The Greek Pizza and The Quatro Formazzio. I had a half slice of each and a small corner of the Calzone and they are all very good. Also a cannoli was ordered I had a bite of it and it was very good as well. 

The atmosphere did leave something to be desired but the food more than made up for it, it was very much strip mall feeling. The service was very good and it looked like they had a great delivery business, I wish we did live closer to here so we could get delivery but it does give us a reason to get out of the house."}
{"text":"This place is affordable, family oriented and has delicious garlic bread and a tomato sauce that's to die for. (Make sure to order a lot of the garlic bread because they're tiny!) Great pizza and very nice staff. Go there!"}
{"text":"I'm getting this place five stars simply based on the fact that they except BitCoin.

I ordered the rustica pizza as well as some garlic knots - both are very good."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and Greek Salad.  Niko and his brother are great guys.  Always happy to help a locally owned business.  I hope they are around for a long time to come!"}
{"text":"We LOVE the pizza here. One of the best in Vegas!! Cheese pizza, Hawaii, pepperoni...all fantastic. The garlic knots are delicious too. We will keep coming back again and again. We were not a big fan of the cheese sticks though...they were a little plain."}
{"text":"Ordered a pepperoni pizza and eggplant parmesan sandwich. Pizza was average but not bad by any means. Sandwich was delicious. Will definitely order from here again based on their speedy delivery and will try the garlic knots next by all of the great reviews i've seen. Thank you Rustica Pizzeria."}
{"text":"We really love this place. We are chicken strip meal regulars. Gave this place 4 stars because every time we order they put the plastic ranch containers on top of the fresh out of the fryer hot chicken and they melt. Then there's gelatinous burning hot ranch all over your meal. So be smarter than I and always leave a note to leave the ranch outside the container! With that said, food is always delicious and delivery is quick!"}
{"text":"I needed to get something for my wife for dinner when I was going out with friends.  I have seen Rustica as I've driven by and decided to give it a try.

I drove there and placed my order and waited for it.  About 10 minutes later, I left with a large--18 inch--New York Style four cheese pizza.  I also got 5 garlic knots that are free with a Yelp checkin.

My wife enjoyed the pizza and I had a leftover piece for lunch the next day.  While I like Sicilian crust better, this was good.  It was good enough that I purchased a Yelp deal that I'll use in the future.

A very OK spot with a nice menu and not far from home."}
{"text":"Our new favorite pizza/Italian place!  Extensive menu.  So far we have had their pizza, burger and chicken parmesan.  Going to work our way through the whole menu.  Great food and service - and ROSIE - our favorite waitress in all of Vegas.  Family run business and everything is very fresh. Nice atmosphere too.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Not as good as NY pizza, but for vegas pizza is was pretty good. Friendly service and the place was clean. Even the bathroom..I.will be back"}
{"text":"I end up getting a to-go from here whenever I'm in the mood for pizza. I enjoy ordering from here because of the pesto sauce they have. That and even just one meat or veggie will do it for me. Ordered the wings once as well and they were alright, but the pizza is where it's at. Also as a tip, they honor the yelp deal as well without any problem."}
{"text":"I've had dinner here a few times and I have been very impressed with the quality of their menu items.  Consistent which is always a plus.  The pizza is phenomenal! Try the spinach calzone it is to die for!"}
{"text":"Update: went again tonight. Dine in style with antipasto, wings, Philly cheese steak and beer. Antipasto is a great salad, wings were ok, but the Philly cheese steak was excellent. I'm not too sure why the bad reviews but maybe dine in and try other stuff. I didn't like the pizza so much but everything else has been really good. Yea I know, it's supposed to be a pizza place.... Maybe think about it like a bar, they are only supposed to have drinks but sometimes they have great food too :)"}
{"text":"Came here the othe day for lunch with the family. The pizza is good and the deals are great, but the waitress was not all there. She kept rushing us to hurry up and order and when we were ready, wouldn't even let us finish talking. So by the time the food came out, she had ordered us a whole other pizza set because she didn't let us finish talking or listen to us. Like I said the foods good, but the service could be worked on"}
{"text":"Liked this place until today. Their own website directed me to eat24 in order to place a food order. On the site it lists a special of 9.99 (see picture) the owner would not honor it because my husband no proof when he went to pick up (I ordered online through their website's link)  

He claimed if you call in to order he would've honored it (the price) and I should call eat24 for a refund and to complain. I told him that was his job and his answer was \"maybe if customers call they'll listen.\"  

I advised him I work In The executive suites behind his shop (same parking lot) and often order $100 worth of food at time when I teach classes and workshops, and he could at least offer me a $5 credit for next time. 

He refused and I advised I'll no longer do business with him and I'd be posting to yelp. 

This is not how reward loyal customers who expect what's listed on their site (or a third party site) to be accurate and honored. BS.  

Way too much drama for a greasy, average pizza."}
{"text":"Love the food here!!! Fast service!! They have really good quality food!! I love the chicken Parmesan wings they are the best!!!"}
{"text":"The Stromboli was fantastic! We ordered 2 to-go and we were so happy & satisfied! Ordered both with pep & sausage, both were so fresh & yummy. I checked in and they honored the free garlic knots with my to-go order. The sauce that came with everything was pretty good, nothing too spectacular but good. I'd defiantly eat here again!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza with amazing crust. Have only been here once so far because we just moved to Las Vegas about a month ago. I was a bit concerned when I walked in the door because the place looks kinda corporate-fake-Italian. Wasn't sure whether I would get bad pizza or cheap, fast-food style pizza, but it was actually really good. The crust is a crispy, golden brown that's just a bit on the thin side. Toppings are all very tasty. Definitely recommend this place for pizza if you're in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Very meh. My wife and I ordered out, and got the Yelp deal. We were looking for pizza and wings, and since this place had good reviews and a deal, we figured why not.

Well, the experience was very underwhelming. We got wings and fries, and upgraded them to greek fries. We got a pizza with a bunch of toppings, though I don't remember exactly what it was.

When we got there it was dead empty, which I thought wasn't a great sign since it was around dinner time. We got the food, struggled a bit with redeeming the Yelp deal, and went home.

For some reason, whoever made the wings and fries decided to throw them both together in a closed styrofoam to go box. Even though it was 5 minutes back to our apartment, by the time we got there the fries were the mushiest thing I've ever experienced. Also the \"greek\" aspect was almost non existent. The wings were also mushy and not very flavorful.

At this point I was disappointed, but I figured whatever, it's take out fries, hopefully the pizza is good. Well, it was alright. It's hard for me to not feel like pizza is very tasty. I mean, it's bread, cheese, garlic, sauce, how bad could it get? This wasn't \"bad\" but it also wasn't good. I felt very meh about it, which is unusual for me and pizza.

Overall, we won't be back as our money is better spend elsewhere for italian take out."}
{"text":"Well worth the drive!  The pizza and wingers were excellent.  Nice friendly staff and you could tell everything was made fresh with love.

I can't wait to go back and try the Philly cheese steak!"}
{"text":"I have tried many pizzas in the area and Rustica is the best.  Ive been a customer since I moved to Vegas several yrs ago and they never disappoint.  Crust is crispy, sauce slightly spicey and fresh ingredients.  Gal on the phone is always quick and courteous.  Perhaps my only bummer is I wish they would send me pizza specials more often :-)"}
{"text":"Its been a little over a year since i visited this place.  I was just there 2 days ago and ordered the same exact menu.  I hate to rate so harshly, but the garlic knots were stale.  I will keep them at four stars for now.  Pizza is still great

Ordered the special. 2 large pepperoni pizza for $23.  Added black olive to one and the other we added sausage and bacon.

Crust had an amazing fluffy crunch to it that made me wanting more.  The topping were the right amount down to the cheese.  My kids loved it as well.  

We also ordered the plain garlic knots which was delicious.  My two girls kept fighting over the melted garlic butter and chopped garlic."}
{"text":"Great customer service ! Amazing pizza will be back over and over again to.see Pauline and Chris!!!"}
{"text":"The delivery was fast but unfortunately the pizza was cold?! Not sure if I just ordered at an off hour? If the pizza was piping hot it would have been great."}
{"text":"Pizza always tastes good, and their fingers might even out weight their pizza. Great customer service. Not a big fan of their ranch dressing (i use it on everything). It left a bad after taste, not only with me, but with my wife as well."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love it here! Good pizza and awesome customer service!we ordered a grinder to share and they were nice enough to serve it to us cut in half!"}
{"text":"Great service.  I asked our pizzas to be delivered at 11:15, as my girl's birthday party was ending at 12.  Even though their store open time is 11, they were on time and the pizzas were hot and so good.  Everybody loved the pizza and asked where I got them from.  Thank you so much!!! Will definitely order from you very soon :)"}
{"text":"Pizza is good traditional style. Service is always friendly. Good pricing and they have a slice special. Good neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Took about 1 hour and 15 mins on a Sunday night. The eggplant parmesian dinner was hot and yummy. Very well done.  Can serve 4 its so big. Hit the spot. I had seconds. The Caprese Salad was interesting. Asked what kind of dressing I wanted. Seemed Wierd. Normally don't get a choice of dressing. Standard is evoo and balsamic vinegar. And certainly not ranch. I understood when it was delivered.  Served on lettuce  with the dressing on the side. No balsamic on it. Easy fix. JUst took the mozzerella tomatoe and basil off the iceberg ( blah) lettuce.  Drizzled my own balsamic vinegar on it.  Mozzerella was yummy. Tomatoes perfect on ripeness and firmness. Fresh basil. Pretty darn good. Will order from again."}
{"text":"The spaghetti I got came with literally no sauce. I paid $9 for a small portion of dry, almost sauceless spaghetti. Not very impressed"}
{"text":"Chicken fingers and fries are the bomb!!!  Best in town  really, I keep coming back for them, Salad I had was Fair, the customer service needs some work sorry to say, but I keep going back for the fingers!!!  Get them and run !!"}
{"text":"Thought we would try this for the first time since we received a flyer...bad choice. Ingredients are cheap. Was cold when we received it and seemed under cooked. The sausage was sparse throughout the entire pie but had more onions than anything else. Meats were salty. Not good at all."}
{"text":"For several months I worked in the storefront next door to Rustica Pizzeria on a political campaign. Political campaigns are fueled by pizza and it was very convenient to have a pizza place right next door.  I mainly went for lunch. Two slices of pepperoni and a Diet Dr. Pepper set me back about $7 and change.  The pizza is thin and the slices large. The place wasn't ever tremendously busy at lunch time. I think they pick up for dinner with both carryout and dine in. Definitely a good spot for lunch if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"***DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY***

So.... Ordered a pizza online through Yelp at 6:50 on a Monday night. Email comes through, says it should take 45-60 minutes (which is cited on their website). Okay, seems a long time for a pizza, but it's delivery, whatever. 

Email from the third party eat24 comes through with the confirmation, says confirmed order time is 90 minutes.... Ok whatever. 

I should note, the pizza place is .8 miles from my location..... Yes, less than a mile. 

90 minutes comes, I use the online app to message eat24 who follows up on my order... They say driver should be here 10-15 minutes. 

15 minutes goes by, I message again. They said they would follow up to find out where in the world our order is. As she's following up, there is a knock on the door (ten minutes shy of two hours for a pizza less than a mile away). 

Pizza was completely cold, we had to microwave it. All the delivery person had to say was \"sodas free\". We pointed out it took nearly two hours, nothing was said by him and he left. 

I contacted eat24 again (btw eat 24 is amazing) I told them what happened and asked them to please reverse the tip I had paid for in advance online. (I usually am a pretty generous tipper, but this was simply the worst service I've had in a long time)

Eat24 stated they'd have an account manager follow up with the location to vastly improve their service. 

And on top of it all.... Was not that impressed by the pizza. Hope this was a one off, but if it wasn't...... I would not suggest frequenting this place."}
{"text":"I have dined in and ordered delivery and pickup. I really like there pizza and the prices are great. They are friendly and I enjoy there food. I am repeated customer."}
{"text":"It seems like eating in is the way to go- delivery is not.  A few friends ate at the restaurant and liked it so much we had pizza delivered -twice.  The delivery was on time, but both times a big disappointment.  Just bad; I didn't eat it either time."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, garlic knots, salad and a medium pizza. Nothing was great but nothing bad either, everything was just ok. I was surprised to see the garlic knots swimming in some sort of oil ( it for sure wasn't butter or olive oil). By the time I got the pizza half the cheese had slid of the pizza. I do have to say delivery was on time and the driver was really nice. All in all I wouldn't go back or order from here again."}
{"text":"Posted closing at 9PM on a Friday night; yet 4 hungry people are turned away at 8:30PM?  

Might explain why they were empty when the next restaurants down the street had a 45+ minute wait to be seated. 

They latched the door behind us, lest they be bothered by any more potential customers..."}
{"text":"Used the restaurant delivery service and couldn't be happier! They arrived earlier than the estimated delivery time, and the pizza was perfect and hot! Flavor far exceeds the chain brands around here- everything tastes so fresh! We will be loyal customers of Rustica!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I ordered from Eat24 they billed my card but I never got my order. No delivery no call from the restaurant. I tried to call and the phone just rings and rings. Worst place ever don't order from here now I gotta call the bank and eat 24 to see how I get my money back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Waitress is always on top of the drinks, gives my kids her tablet so they can play while they wait. Pizza tastes great and prices are reasonable. Def our go-to place when we want pizza!"}
{"text":"We had a pleasant experience here! The pizza was delicious and had a really great crust. We also had some garlic knots which were delicious and gone too soon. The waitresses were really friendly and even paid special attention to our two small kids. We used a yelp deal and got the two pizza with one topping deal. I'm always a bit apprehensive when trying a new pizza place, but I was pleasantly surprised with this one."}
{"text":"Best pizza and all around best pizza place on the west side. The grinders are delicious and i would highly recommend the greek fries! My wife and i love this place."}
{"text":"We got Rustica to go last night and the food was great.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Went back here as it is now Rustic Pizzeria. Not impressed. The sauce sucked, pizza sucked and it was sooo soggy. So disappointed and we will not be going back. Sunset pizza was great and this is such a disappointment. Garlic knots were good though, thankfully."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Huge portions for our reasonably priced meal. No problems accommodating our party of 6. Our party had antipasta, wings, pizza & Stromboli. Everyone was happy with their meal. Would recommend."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and are thrilled we did. Cute little place, very clean, good value, great service, enormous menu, and is now our favorite pizza place here in Vegas. The service was very welcoming and warm. We had a supreme pizza and homemade lasagna. The crust was amazing. Taste very fresh which makes the pizza delicious. Lasagna was excellent. Taste just like mom use to make. Possibly even better honestly! They make their own ranch dressing which was amazing, and tasted excellent on our supreme pizza and salad that came with the lasagna. Definitely a great little place to sit back and enjoy some comfort food."}
{"text":"Thank you to Pauline & Chris! I have eaten here 4 or five timesnow and they have catered my work lunches. The food here has ag reat taste, and the service is excellent. This is a family-owned business so I appreciate even more the equity the owners are putting in to grow the clientele. Thank you again for great food and service. Cheese pizza and conolli,s!!!"}
{"text":"I have ordered for delivery many, many times from Rustica, I always get the same thing, Medium Pepperoni, side order of fries and a two-liter Sprite. $22. Worth every penny. I'm always impressed with the portion of fries. The pizza itself is delicious, a little too greasy sometimes, but delicious. Something in the cheese that tears my stomach apart the day after and never fails, but as I said earlier- it's worth it haha. Friendly customer service, fast delivery."}
{"text":"Rustic is a great classic pizza joint. Nice selection, priced competitively, decent specials. We have been coming here for years."}
{"text":"Order lunch delivery, one item was lunch special 2 slice of pizza with sausage and Coke.  The completely forgot the Coke and the driver just shrugged her shoulders and left.  Pizza was grease and cold, the sausage looked like it was added afterwards not even attached to the cheese, just really sad.  The second item was a ham and cheese sub with fries.  I got grease, soggy, mushy fries and highly over salted all you could taste was oil and salt.  The ham sandwhich which didn't say on the menu anything about it being heated had melted provolone cheese and extremely salty ham.  All in all not recommended one of my first orders and most definetly my last.  Save your money and order somewhere else, somewhere where they may care if they bring the complete order and food that is good."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Crust is crispy, toppings are perfect. Our favorite pizza place! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We ordered a large sausage pizza when we opened the box it was hott and smelled delicious my son is very picky with his pizza and he loved it he said the sauce was so tasty and the flavor of the sausage was the best he's ever had on a pizza definitely five stars plus and we will be coming back in the very near future I also saw the the meatball parm sandwich and it made my mouth water I highly recommend rustica pizza !!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good pizza/pasta place close to home. On a hot day off, it is nice to be able to go pick up some tasty food and relax in the house. Found this place on yelp, had everything we wanted, and I am so happy to say we weren't disappointed in the slightest! 
     We ordered a variety of items--pizza, eggplant parm, and a Italian sausage grinder. Everything was so hot and fresh when I picked it up, with great portions. All of the ingredients were great quality--the cheese on the pizza was yummy, and my husband said his eggplant parm was cooked so perfect, the combo of ingredients melted in his mouth. I could tell they paid attention to the little details, specifically with the little side salads--I've seen some that just throw lettuce and tomato in a container and call it good, but these ones had a nice variety of toppings on them. And everything was packed up with care. My only regret is I didn't get the garlic knots, but I know we will be trying them again. I think we found our new home base for pizza!"}
{"text":"Delivery service is great. Fast, friendly, and packaged well. However the food was meh. I ordered a pizza with a few toppings which looked fresh but tasted weirdly generic. The cheese didn't taste like cheese if you know what I mean. I'm a huge supporter of local businesses and try to avoid corporate mega chains. But this pizza didn't taste much better. #sorrynotsorry"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in vegas.  The pizza is always good, reasonably priced and thr pepperoni garlic knots and garlic fries are great!  Got the pasta once...it was ok.  That said my friend gets spaghetti there 2x a week.  Oh and oddly they are closed on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Love this place, they have decent wine and the atmosphere is pleasent. The waitress is a sweetheart and genuinely loves her job. LG pizza for 9.99 is a deal"}
{"text":"I don't usually give reviews on restaurants on the first try, BUT this pizza was so good I couldn't resist!  We ordered the cheese with mushrooms and it was delicious - even the crust was good.  I am glad it is so close to home, Rustica just took over first place for best pizza in our neighborhood.  Can't wait to try some of the other items."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant with a really friendly staff !
Let's try there the lasagna... They are awesome.
Pizzas are really good to; I was just a little bit disappointed by the dessert but this is not what I will remember."}
{"text":"RUSTICA RESTAURANT IS DEFINITELY NOT Another BAD place we have ordered from since we moved out here in 2014. A place that will mess our order up and not care or the Manager is not here and who ever is in control can not make any decisions or call on Monday when the Mgr. Is working. 
Rustica has excellent fresh food. Customer service is important to them.
We always do delivery. One time we ordered the wings {which is awesome} they forgot the Blue Cheese and the owner came out to bring it. What service that was. This is our new place we order at least once a week.  This restaurant Excels with awesome food excellent delivery and great customer service. The food is fresh did I mention that. :}
Thank you"}
{"text":"My husband & I just had a large Sicilian Mikey's with an Italian sub. Pizza was average and I wouldn't even be compelled to write a review, except this establishment should be ashamed of themselves for charging $8.79 for an Italian sub, that had barely 2 slices of meat, and NO cheese! And the meat that was visible was not \"Delicious deli meat,\" per their menu. Yelpers Beware especially when you carry out!!"}
{"text":"Homey atmosphere and impressive eats. Three of us shared a Large pizza, one of their original style with thin crust, and it was very good! 
We also ordered an appetizer (wings) which were delivered after the pizza. Sort of unusual, but the consensus was that the wings were very good. 
The pizza had lots of toppings and was a generous size. We also shared a dessert, cinnamon bites with raspberry sauce. Loved it! 
Beer & wine are available, and wine for $4 a glass is a typical price. The glass of red I had was pretty decent. 
Would consider returning if I'm spending time in the area again."}

Food is good, and filling. Wish I ordered less. I'll order again, probably directly from them!"}
