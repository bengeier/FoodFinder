{"text":"I went there and ordered a falafel wrap. The lady that was working took it out of the freezer and put it in the microwave. I was shocked that it wasn't  fresh and when I took a bite out of it I almost broke a tooth it was that hard. If I am paying almost $10 for something  I want it to be fresh. It was Horrible i will never eat there again!"}
{"text":"Love this place, it's easily the second best donair in the Calgary greater area.  The first being only slightly better, but way too far for me to go.  By far the friendliest people around, can't go wrong here.  The only reason 4 stars instead of 5 is because they have shorter hours, and I usually have a craving for donair outside their hours.    It's an awesome donair shop, what else is there to say?"}
{"text":"Had one for lunch the other day, delicious. Should have splurged for a size bigger than the regular, almost went back for more.  Owner is social with patrons, overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Owner is great, friendly and will chat up all the patrons...  Beef and chicken donairs are tasty, watch the rotisserie meat spinning!  4 sizes of donairs...  the 2 smaller donairs come on a smaller wrap, and the 2 larger donairs come on a larger wrap.  Try the combo (beef and chicken)  oh yeah... you will be burping tasty sauce all afternoon."}
{"text":"The beef donairs at this place are amazing!!! Their signature sweet sauce is soooo addictive & everything is super fresh and delicious. They recently renovated and added new menu items like fries & poutine. Perfect!   I haven't even tried chicken because the beef donair is so fantastic. Highly recommended.   The owner is often there and is super nice. You can tell he cares about his business, you can taste the love in his food! This is a \"must try\" place in Airdrie."}
{"text":"For a busy lunch place to have only 2 people working it's sort of a shame.  Things would be a lot faster if there was a bit more help during a busy rush.  The service from the two people where were there was excellent though.  The donair meat was tasty and flavourful.  The sweet sauce was pretty good and the lettuce and tomato was fresh.  One big gripe I had was that the pita wrap I had was too small for the amount of meat I ordered (one of the larger sizes).  It just ended up being a sloppy mess half way through."}
