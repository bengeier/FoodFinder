{"text":"AS with the 4-star rating description provided by Yelp, yes, I'm a fan of Yuki. When I come here, I don't go for its lovely sushi or sashimi, instead, try its chicken udon or chicken/pork katsu don or curry selections. They are especially good for lunch. In my opinion, these ARE the hidden gems of Yuki's offerings. The taste of these dishes can match what is served in a fancy Japanese restaurant and yet their price is nothing if not reasonable. With a nice hot cup of tea, the meal is complete and cost-efficient. In the many years I've been visiting here, these dishes have never failed me. What's more, I appreciate the ambience inside, since it's never too full and raucous, and when it's quiet on a Thursday night, you can ask to be seated by the window to take in what's happening on Bloor West.

Choose Yuki if you want to escape the crowd of diners in the Annex. Explore and enjoy their tasty non sushi dishes."}
{"text":"Ordered l14 lunch special ( beef teriyaki bento box). Food was ok, price was a bit expensive ($11). Food was not filling. Soup tasted weird. Salad did not taste fresh. Wasabi in the middle of the hole where I'm suppose to put soy sauce. No where else to put soy sauce except on the sushi itself (if you don't like wasabi)"}
{"text":"It was a decent place to eat and the service was good. I don't think its the best curry I've had, but it is definitely good. Recommend for a quick bite if you're a student nearby."}
{"text":"One of my go-to places in the area when I want to eat a decently priced and yummy tasting Japanese food for lunch. I am confident in saying that Yuki Japanese swiftly kicks New Generation's ass.

If you are here for lunch, I would recommend getting the beef teriyaki + tempura bento box (I believe it is $9). You get delicious food for what you pay for."}
{"text":"I ordered Don Buri with shrip and \"tempura bits.\" The tempura had been cooked hours earlier and reheated to gummy yuck. Too bad. If it had been fresh and crispy, I would have liked it. I had to scrape off the icky batter and just eat the slices of zucchini. 

On one other visit, it was ok."}
{"text":"I have had to hold back tears after a meal in the past, but never before have I had to stifle my tears prior to a meal. That is, until I lunched at Yuki Japanese.

There is nothing remotely Japanese about this restaurant. The decor so perfectly captures the suicidal ambiance of a small town casino, and the patrons hold little distinction to the picture our minds paint when imagining gambling addicts. It may be harsh to suggest that Yuki's food render its customers to the vegetative state of addicts, but the truth is you'd have to be stubbornly mindless to be a regular here. The frog lady waitress (and probably owner) serving you your food looks like she jumped out of a Tarantino movie--if Tarantino ever made a slasher film based around a grimy restaurant--gliding across the restaurant while dragging her feet in exhaustion--she took my order with the enthusiasm of a potato.
Miso soup, green dragon roll, chicken katsu bento box, and a cup of tea.

As I looked around at the sad faces at this restaurant I began feeling sorry for myself. Not for any particular reason, I suppose I was simply blending in.

My miso soup arrived and I grabbed the bowl and lifted it to my mouth. Just then, something fell to my crotch from the bottom of the bowl. I assumed it to be a cracker of some sorts and continued to gulp my soup down. But I didn't order anything resembling of a cracker, or bread, or anything crackerbread in colour. I put down my soup bowl and reached for the mysterious object. The soft, warm and wet texture registered only when I held it close to my face to examine it closely. The hairs on my body erected as if it was trying to jump from my skin, and the goose bumps sent a rush of sheer chill of disgust down my spine when I realized I was holding somebody's freshly chewed gum between my fingers. I immediately stuck it under the table next to me, but the sticky substance clanged on in a stringy stretch of grossness resembling a hot slice of cheesy pizza being pulled away from the pie. I wiped my fingers on every surface trying to rid of the horror from my hands. No one noticed my silent horror episode. I sat in my seat panting for air, and holding back the scream that was desperately trying to escape me.

I sat in my seat in silence as if the rest of the world did not exist. When I snapped back to reality, my food was already sitting on my table. I completely missed the frog lady bringing me my orders. Never has a bento box and a sushi platter struck more fear into my heart. Two girls came through the doors, and immediately I saw them not as patrons, but victims. Victims of the health code violations and unsanitary conditions of this wretched restaurant. I wanted to warn them. I wanted to jump from my table and rush the girls out of the restaurants and run far far away. Instead, I just sat in my seat shell-shocked. Post-traumatic stress syndrome from a sushi restaurant.

I ended up finishing all my food with disdain, promising I would tell the world about this place. The truth is, I grew up in worst conditions. I've ate in lesser places. But this is Canada, and I am allowed to be disgusted and lie to myself about living in Toronto where there is a delusion of standards!

The avocado tasted a days' old, the miso soup tasted of preservatives, and the eel fish had the texture of the days' old avocado. I welcomed myself to the worst restaurant experience of my entire life, and now I see the world like a veteran of war after having served my time and ate my dues at Yuki's revolting Japanese Ya. I assume 'YA' is the sound you'd make when you discover the quality and sanitary conditions of this place

I am now a man of hardened palate, as I can finally proclaim that I have quite literally eaten shit."}
{"text":"In a neighbourhood with a lot of sushi, it's hard to stand out. This one has a geographic advantage; you may be craving sushi as you walk west from St. George and be unwilling to continue a few more blocks to where the restaurants line both sides of Bloor. I've wandered to that block and find the sushi very uneven. Yuki Japanese is consistently fresh, tasty and unpretentious. I have a vague memory that they play classical music in the background - not sure I've experienced that in any other sushi joints. They have a kitchen that can be viewed from the seating area and that always boosts my confidence. Prices are reasonable. Best for dining alone or with one friend.

Nice place and a welcome option in the restaurant dead zone between Spadina and Yonge."}
{"text":"I had a sushi epiphany today sitting by my lonesome at Yuki Japanese at the side of Dufferin street in a strip mall.  Actually a few of them:

1. Garlic and sushi are a weird combo.  I never noticed the absence of garlic at other sushi restaurants I've been to, but its presence was obvious today.  Both the salad and the glass noodle dish that came with my lunchtime Bento box were chock full of garlic.  It didn't work.  Rather than complement anything, it just overpowered the sushi.  Feh.

2. The freshness of the peripheral dishes/elements are just as important as the sushi itself.  Again - I never noticed this before, but y'know those beet/daikon/carrot ribbons that often accompany sushi?  Turns out they play an important role - they signal freshness by being crisp and fresh themselves.  At Yuki, the side dishes were a little tired looking.  The glass noodles were over cooked and the beansprout dish looked like it was a few days old.  Double Feh.  It made me question the freshness of the fish and that is something you never want to do at a sushi restaurant.

3. Salmon sinew is kinda gross.  Guess that's why most sushi restaurants clean it off before serving it in sushi rolls.

Contrary to my persnickety review, I'm usually pretty easy going with sushi.  I'll even eat supermarket sushi when I'm hungry (hey, beats a sandwich).  I rarely leave rolls uneaten.  But I left food over today.  I just wasn't interested in eating salmon that looked like it hadn't been cleaned properly.  Made me wonder: what else wasn't cleaned properly?"}
{"text":"I remember when Yuki was Rolu Sushi - which my favourite sushi place on Bloor.  I was a huge fan of Rolu, and it seems as if although the name has changed, they have similar style sushi to that of their predecessor.

We came for lunch and I found the lunch specials were slightly expensive compared to other places and the menus were fairly large, slightly unclear. Their lunch sets are quite big, though so there is an explanation for why it costs more. But the sushi was GREAT, just like old times.  The staff are friendly and the food presentation is nice."}
{"text":"Good udon, but sashimi is not good and is expensive at $6.50 for 3 pieces. The cut of the sashimi and flavour is much worse than places where I can get 5 pieces with only $5.50"}
{"text":"Traditional Japanese dishes offered here. The katsudon was quite good. Tonkatsu was not as crispy as I'd like but the portion size was good and the balance of tonkatsu to rice was very appropriate. Sauce was well balanced, and the dish overall was a nice combination of salty, sweet and umami.
Service was attentive and unobtrusive.
Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Yuki was pretty Yucky :(

Maybe it's just what I ordered, but it's Chinese people imitating Japanese food...badly. The Beef bowl was just Chinese beef brisket! The ones at the Spadina truck food are miles better and cheaper. Got the maki salmon sushi and it was like amateur home-made sushi.

I really wanted to like this place, but it was just too disappointing compared to the other places in the area (like Sakura, New Gen, Big Sushi, and even Big Sushi) which tend to be even cheaper, with bigger portions, and better quality."}
{"text":"A decently priced lunch just a short walk from U of T on Bloor. My dining companions and I came in on a Monday that happened to be a federal holiday, which probably explains why the girl working there was kind of a sourpuss, but no matter -- they were open (unlike most of the businesses around), the food came out fast, and we were grateful. My chicken tempura bento box was pretty good; the chicken (mostly dark meat) was juicy and wasn't too fatty. The lettuce in my salad was slightly limp, but not offensively so. I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Tokyo subway map right in the entrance to a modern white vinyl booth interior.  Same guy with cool glasses is usually running the show.  The sashimi is fresh and the lunch options inexpensive.  I tend to like ordering ala carte but that moves the $7 lunch to $40.  Bento boxes are more around $15-17 and a more reasonable option.  

This deserves far better than the lone existing two star review.  Part of the nearly empty stretch of Bloor from Spadina to Yorkville, a crucial sushi outpost exists where only a wasteland of Pizza Pizza and Timmy's filth resides.  Fresh is next door but for those of you who don't want to waste away on vegan smoothies get some bio available Omega 3 fatty acids here.  Eat fish not mulch."}
{"text":"Pros: 
- Volcano roll had nice presentation. 
- Prices were decent.

Cons:
- My stomach felt weird after eating the volcano roll. Most likely because of the not so fresh ingredients and the abundant amount of panko flakes on the volcano roll. 
- The restaurant itself reeked of piss. The stench was particularly strong towards the right side of the restaurant where the bathrooms are. Hmm...
- The overall ambiance of the restaurant was depressing - the feeling of uncleanliness, the stench of piss, the covered windows, the dark walls and furniture, the fluorescent lighting and the defeated expressions on the staff members' faces all contributed to the dinghy-ness of the restaurant. 
- The waitress was standoffish and rude. She barely spoke to me (she only spoke when she asked how many people per table when I came in) and when I wanted to get the bill she didn't even bother to come to my table. I had to physically get up to the cash register and pay for my meal myself."}
{"text":"Came here because Fresh had a long wait and my DC and I were hungry and didn't have much time to eat.  

I have walked by this place numerous times and thought it looked like just another cheap, fast, mediocre Japanese restaurant in the Annex. So, this place was what I expected for the most part. 

FOOD: Actually, relative to other comparable Japanese restaurants, this place was not that cheap. The veggie bento I got was $11, and I know that ain't much but I can get the same thing from Simon Sushi or Sushi on Queen for less than $10. It came with tofu teriyaki that was just meh. The sauce was really weird and not teriyaki-like. It was this orangey-brown gelatinous goo, that I tried to scrape off mostly. The veggie rolls, salad, miso soup, and veggie dumplings were fine but nothing special. 

SERVICE: our waitress was certainly, um, economical in her use of words. Basically once our order was out of our mouth, she was like \"OK\" and disappeared before we could finish. When we were done our meal, she came by and asked \"Finish?\" and then took our plates without a word. Brusque, but I guess efficient. The ladies next to us asked her for more water and she didn't say anything and just ran off. I think they were miffed and unsure if she even heard them, but she did come back in a few seconds with water... 

There are so many better options in the area, so I don't think I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is still my favourite place to get sushi. The prices aren't amazing, the lunch combo options aren't all that great, but the sushi is just so good! I love how the sweet potato sushi has a bit of mayo.. yum! And I like sushi that is actually bite size and this place lives up to that (the rolls aren't enormous). 
It's a small place but the atmosphere is enjoyable (not tacky like some places), and it is usually pretty quiet. I always read the poster of the different types of sushi on the wall and the map of the tokyo subway system while I am waiting haha."}
{"text":"This place is a tough place to review. To be honest I don't quite understand what Yuki is all about.

The clientele for this restaurant is usually younger and so this place can be fairly loud. The service here isn't great. If it isn't too busy the service is usually sufficient, but when the lunch hour starts up the service can be somewhat dismissive or rushed. 

The food is reasonably priced. Their sushi is a bit more expensive than many other places in Toronto. That being said, I found the rice and sauces used in their sushi rolls to be a lot tastier. 

I think Yuki is in desperate need of a makeover. The menus are falling apart and the restaurant window is covered by an ugly sun-bleached screen. If they put together a lunch menu that better appealed to their age-range and hired another chef, I think they'd be a lot more profitable."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but the grilled beef and mushroom looks weird. They definitely never tried to make the dish looks okay.
The service was so bad. Don't know why but they Asian waitress never said a word to me during the whole service. She just nod and let it go. Sometimes she didn't even stand near my table to give me my food, instead she stands so far and just use her 'long' arm to pass the dish on my desk. I said thank you after I made the payment, she did not even reply a single word. Interesting, ha?"}
