{"text":"Just got back from a very tasty brunch at Wallace & co.   Had a nice americano and a traditional breakfast. Portions were good and the waits weren't too bad.   Service could have been more attentive, but all in all a great meal. Would eat there again. Nice spot considering there aren't many others in the close vicinity."}
{"text":"3.5-4 stars. Went for Sunday brunch at about 11 am. Hubby and I waited 10 minutes for seats at the counter- best seats in the house for the sheer theatre of two very busy short order cooks! They were slammed with what seemed to be an entire house turnover, including two tables of six, so our orders took about 20 minutes to arrive, but it was entertaining and worth it. The staff hustles and is friendly. We had a traditional breakfast - scrambled eggs, good toast, pea meal, good baked beans, home fries and fried tomato wedge- and cornbeef hash (big chunks) and home fries topped with two sunny eggs and fennel slaw! Oodles of food and yummy to boot! The burgers, fries and homemade sausage patties looked great as they were prepared in front of us. Huge, thick burgers not overwhelmed by the buns. With good coffee, refilled free, our food bill was $27. It ain't fancy, but it's good! ( and the washrooms are basic, but clean!). Important to know: cash only with ATM across the road."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch. Amazing service and friendly staff. I wish I could say the same about the food.. We found it all overly greasy, without the flavour to match. If you want that hangover fix of greasy spoon then go for it."}
{"text":"I went here on the Victoria Day around 10am and the place was empty - certainly could have been due to the holiday and it was a bit early for some brunchers. By 11am when we left the place was about half full.   The menu was a little small, but there were some options. I had the all day/standard breakfast (sorry can't remember the exact name) and it was a lot of food. Really reasonable price for a huge plate of food. The food was well cooked, and I liked the beans as a different touch to just the standard eggs, meat and toast.   The staff was really friendly, and I was pleased with their attentiveness. The atmosphere was casual and relaxed.    It is a cash only location so keep that in mind. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My pals and I go pretty often cause we work on the same street and I have to say from all the junction area choices this is my favorite spot by far. The burgers are very tasty, the coffee is great and the staff is very friendly.  Only taking off a star cause they don't accept credit card. Come on guys! get an ipad and problem solved!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. It's the closest breakfast place to my house and since Bloordale Diner was replaced I need somewhere with a good breakfast. Unfortunately, the food can be great but is terribly inconsistent - about 75% of the time the eggs are poorly cooked - and the service is just plain awful. And then of course there's the always annoying lack of a debit/credit payment option.  The potential's there but I can only hope they get it together SOON."}
{"text":"I hated this place. Just weird looks and bad service from the staff because me and my gf were the only non hipsters in the place. It's like they were pissed we were in their club. Similar experience at boxcar social today as well. Wouldn't suggest it to anyone or wallace and co"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to go to! Maybe it's because I've been a bajillion times and only ever gotten the breakfast sandwich. It is SO good. That milk bun and maple sausage is just the best combination. I don't love the coleslaw that comes on the side because I am not a huge dill fan. My boyfriend and I usually never eat that..  Anyway.. maybe I'll try something else on the menu one day but the breakfast sandwich never disappoints."}
{"text":"I had lunch there today. Best breakfast I've had for a while. I will definetly visit this place again."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. I've been for both a takeaway burger meal and a sit down brunch and in both cases the food, coffee and service was exceptional. I have an unusual food sensitivity that they have been very accommodating with - above and beyond, really. And you can walk away with taxes and a healthy tip for $20 or less. I'm in."}
{"text":"Service is terrible, food can be amazing, but is inconsistent. There isn't an ATM or a debit option, which sucks. Nonetheless, I don't foresee myself running out of chances for this place, just because I'm really close. I hope to witness them getting it together."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and was pleasantly surprised by Wallace and Co. It's a bit cramped inside but this is a genuine old school greasy spoon I did not regret eating at. The prices weren't bad and servings very good. I had the breakfast sandwich was delicious! Also the server was much more attentive with coffee refills than other places I've been. Just remember to bring cash."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Love that's it is cash only and the price you pay is what is on the menu. Breakfast sandwich is amazing. Very friendly service!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had a few problems with our meals and overall our experience was pretty bad.   I had the breakfast which was okay. I ordered an extra egg which was forgotten, but still charged. The toast was stale, the eggs were overcooked and the coffee was burnt. The pemeal bacon was quite good.   My friends got burgers which were raw (very pink!) not to their liking. (Our waitress didn't ask how we wanted the burgers cooked.)  Our waitress wasn't really present at all: she didn't get us more water when we ran out, didn't ask us if we needed anything.   The cooks in the kitchen were talking very loudly about a story of a friend of theirs who puked all over himself when he was drunk and how the puke had to be cleaned, which was kind of disgusting for us to listen to while we were eating.  There's gotta be better places not too far away..."}
{"text":"I needed a late afternoon snack one day and came across here and figured I would give it a try. It was for take-out around 3pm and given that it's in a somewhat random location, I was pleasantly surprised. Got the breakfast sandwich with homemade maple sausage patty and bacon, an egg (which was perfect over easy) and a bunch of shredded chedder on top (the good kind, like Balderson 1 year or something), and a really nice bun with some aoili that I'm rarely down for but forgot to ask to leave out, and also turned out to be way better than expected. With vinegar-based coleslaw and RIDICULOUSLY good home fries, this cost me $10 flat (OK fine cash only is kind of annoying but I'm used to it as I work and live in a hipster area). Oh and $2 americanos. Oh and they threw in a free ricotta fritter (perfect size, a little glaze but otherwise not too sweet and not too much ricotta). People are complaining about prices here but I think it's well priced - you're going to pay up the arse for special juices and stuff anywhere, so that's where you end up spending $30.  Bottom line: bomb food, well priced, and you're supporting a local resto"}
{"text":"Wallace & Co is a small little diner in the Junction. If you are not in the area save yourself the trouble and go somewhere closer. Another thing you need to know if you do decide to come here is that they only accept cash. I understand they are trying to be hipster but who doesn't take card payments these days? It is 2014!!!! The food was ok nothing to write home about. I ordered the corned beef and  coleslaw.lets just say it was so greasy I had the \"heavybreathings\" after. The service was mediocre; our waitress didn't even say hello upon our arrival and didn't once smile at us :( Will not be going back."}
{"text":"The neighbourhood is still without a decent breakfast prior to 10 am. Expand your market a little by opening your doors at real breakfast hours.... There are more than just hungover hipsters in the hood!.. And while your at it consider dinner. Get known for your food, not your liquor!"}
{"text":"A total junction area treat!   This place is tucked away in a corner with no flashy signs or anything of the sort. But it's just one of those places that if you don't know about their food or you don't take a second to take a look, you just might walk past a very tastey joint!  Very hipster-diner-esq type feel with great menu options and specials offered! I went for brunch a couple of times - their food and their shakes are really good! If you're looking for something fancy, probably not your cup of tea. The diner is very cool place to just hang with friends esp in the summer with the picnic table seating area.    I've gone with friends to try their friend chicken special! If you're present on that friday special - GO!!!!! You will be SORRY if you don't! We were there for the special during dinner hours and near the end they sold out of their chicken becuase it was THAT amazing! You will not regret the chicken!!!   I've read a couple not-so-good reviews about this place in regards to heaviness of grease and I disagree. This is a diner, it's their style of cooking and one of those joints that will put an egg on everything and anything! It's not overly heavy where I feel pimples growing on my face instantly, its just the right amount of goodness!   Excellent place for brunch and not overly priced! Staff are friendly and around - always refilling water, etc.     Tip: Cash only, but there is an ATM in the convenience store directly adjacent from Wallace.   Note: If you're going to complain about carrying some bills in your wallet because its \"2015\" - think about it, technology has screwed us over more than anything else. Live a little and carry some cash - the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast in the city! Cute little spot. Great Italian soda. Great coffee. Amazing food. Good service. Good music. I have been there 3 times in the last month. Food has so much flavour! I suggest everyone to go and try it out."}
{"text":"Delicious, trendy, cozy, and perfect for brunch/lunch in the Lansdowne hood if you need an escape from Starving Artist or something during the week when Whippoorwill ain't open for crunching. I've had everything on the menu, it's delicious....everything except the poutine. I've had the poutine twice and unfortunately it sucks but I'm not downgrading my review because of one dish. The breakfast patty and the all-day breakfast are delicious. The corn-dog is hand breaded, not a pogo or something. Good stuff. The milkshakes are amazing, sour cream caramel is totally my favourite. Go eat some brunch!"}
{"text":"Corner beef hash is amazing, as is their brunch burger.  This joint is a hidden brunch gem in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Put on your thick rimmed glasses, get your beanie out and wear the tightest jeans you have in your closet because this is a hipster diner defined.  This is not a bad thing, the place looks like a vintage diner from the 70's and I dig the vibe they are dishing out.  As uncomfortable as the seats are, they make me feel like I'm a character straight out of a comic book so I'll take the pain to look cool.  The servers are pretty happy to help explain everything on their menu and there is usually just one chef slaving away behind the bar.  Make sure you come early to grab your seats at lunch, because the place fills up quick!  I ordered the Wallace Salted beef - steamed pickled cabbage, thousand island dressing, gruyere, rye with a side of onion rings and a milk shake.  Can I say one thing about that milk shake...it's probably one of the thickest milk shakes I've ever had.  I was worried I would suck up the straw and choke on it, that thing was so solid!  Not a bad thing though, it was great.  The sandwich was great as well, greasy as hell, but I ate up every bite.  I could feel my arteries slowly clogging as I finished the last bite, but it was worth it!  Overall, I really feel the vibe and the food is great here.  A nice local gem in the heart of nothing much else around the Lansdowne area, with delicious hearty food.  Just make sure to have a salad or something for dinner later!"}
{"text":"Wallace & Co is tucked into the junction. It's homes, a convenience store then this corner diner, then more homes, which makes it a neat little stop.  They serve all day breakfast.  Not much to hate about that.  This is a great spot for the morning after, and I imagine it would be a cool spot to get a milkshake in the summer.  They have a small patio with some benches outside.  If you're looking for a healthy option, look elsewhere.  The two killer things to get on this menu are the corned beef hash and dirty burg.  The corned beef hash is a generous serving of potatoes, cabbage and an egg with fatty chunks of corned beef on it.  The dirty burg is fantastic and loaded with cheese, onion, and bacon.  The fries that they come with are also amazing.  The breakfast poutine also intrigued me for next time.  I had the salted caramel milkshake to wash it down/give me a full on heart attack.  Delicious.  One thing to expect from this food is grease.  The dirty burg may have burger priest beat on clogging my arteries.  The hash is also quite oily.  It tastes great, but as a result almost every item on the menu is heavy.  Unless your mission is to gain weight, this is a once in a while/massive hangover diner.  The cooks/servers hustle pretty hard doing everything from washing dishes to wiping tables... but realistically, don't expect the friendly chitchat you may get elsewhere.  Tip:  They only take cash and make sure to dress like a hipster."}
{"text":"We have been surveying the area for a brunch place to call our own and had high hopes for Wallace Co., when we saw something pop up in the former beloved Yasi's.  Unfortunately, our search continues.  My partner and I both had a traditional breakfast ($11). And we were, well, underwhelmed. Though, the baked beans were delicious - the tblsp or so that you get of them and the roasted tomato was a nice touch, the portions (felt like little more than 1-1.5 eggs scrambled),  the few over cooked home fries and 45 minute wait, left much to be desired. I know times are a changing but for an $11brunch, I hope to come away satiated.  We arrived while there were 3 tables sat on the patio and two tables sat inside and it took 15 minutes for our coffee's to come and when our food arrived, I had to get up to seek out the seemingly one bottle of ketchup and hot sauce floating around the room.   As one who served in fast paced environments for a number of years, I realize I'm a tough critic. I also know how easy brunches are to run amuck, if you're not organized. My serving background makes it extra hard to watch other people's food cool on the counter, undelivered, while servers wiz by. Which, pretty much set the tone for this visit. However, what the service lacked in promptness and organization it made up for in demeanour, as the servers were delightful in many ways which, always gets bonus points.  With all said, some of the dishes that did pass our gaze looked fantastic, but as a vegetarian, I won't be able to confirm most. I was particularly impressed with the look of the French toast and would go so far as to blindly recommend it over the breakfast. And the non-brunch items like the burger looked great.  We will likely give this place another shot, as I realize that it takes a new place time to find it's groove. Contrary to to what this review may indicate, I'm still rooting for Wallace & co. And will return with an open mind."}
{"text":"Whoa jackpot! This place has the best burger in the city - The Dirty Burg. Nice patio and off the main strip, the AC is great if it's too hot outside. The crispy chicken sandwich is great as well and the breakfast sandwich is just beautiful."}
{"text":"Horrible experience overall, waitress was rude and inattentive.  One of the many examples is when I asked her the options for drinks (was feeling for a latte or cappuccino) she said only tea or coffee.  When she brought tea that I ordered I noticed a chalk board with all the drinks posted which of course included lattes and cappuccinos.  I told her that when I asked her she didn't mention these other options she just shrugged - and didn't offer to send back my tea for a cappuccino.  I proceeded to then order the cappuccino because that is what I originally wanted and thought I will just pay for the tea anyways since she didn't offer to take it back.  My food was over cooked and not very good.  Will never go back again which is a shame because it is a 2 min walk from my house and was looking for a close breakfast/brunch spot"}
{"text":"A very cute brunch place tucked into a trendy neighbourhood. The service was friendly and the food was great! After walking out on the Starving Artist's terrible service, this was a breath of fresh air!"}
{"text":"The vibe: A small, bustling and cozy brunch spot in a residential neighbourhood. It's the kind of spot where the staff do it all: serving, dishes, and all the cooking happens behind the bar right in front of you.   The food: It feels like you've been transported from downtown Toronto into a rural Southern town with no shortage of beans, eggs and burgers. I ordered the regular breakfast and was pleasantly surprised I could sub my bacon for tempeh which was delicious. The home fries were unreal.  My go-to meal: Standard breakfast, because I'm standard, I guess?  Secret: There's a patio! Also...breakfast poutine. Which I didn't order and am regretting ever since. I'll have to go back ASAP."}
{"text":"Cool little spot, and I do mean little. Don't go with a large group, keep it to a max of 4 I'd say.  I love the breakfast poutine! Had the French toast, which was good but not something I'd probably order again. It's everything I want from a breakfast joint, simple and delicious."}
{"text":"It's like Rose and Sons, but without the 45 minute wait.  Whatever you order - I had a burger, which was not griddle-smashed, but still very juicy and delicious and loaded with sauce - also get a house-made corn dog on the side. You will not regret it.  Fries were crispy, coffee wasn't crap."}
{"text":"Hits all the comfort spots. I had a dirty burger, it was messy, cheddar, bacon, fried onion, bbq aioli, finger licking good. And remember it's cash only, ATM in basement or do a quick run to the bank."}
{"text":"SO much hype surrounded this place when it first opened. Generally when there's a lot of hype I tend to make my own judgements once going there.  I went twice in 2 days. The first time was on a Friday morning, they were out of some of the ingredients for the dish I wanted to order so I tried something else. It was pretty delicious and the atmosphere was very charming. I can't remember what it was but I was obviously willing to go back because,   The next day I went back with a dining companion. I opted for the breakfast burger. What a nightmare. It was SO greasy and hard to eat. I found myself feeling super ill all afternoon from the meal I just ate. AND they raise the price of breakfast items by a few dollars on the weekend which I only noticed because I had been there on a week day. This seems mega slimy to me.   I don't think I will be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  VIBE  First of all, Wallace Street is my new favorite Street in Toronto. It's right near the rail path and there a lot of kind is being built so it's going to definitely be a destination spot in the future. There is also neon café which is right nearby. Is your classic diner. Super simple and not much more to it plus friendly staff. I'm a fan of the picnic tables on their patio. Remember: CASH ONLY! There's an ATM across the street!  I ATE I had heard about their burger so the burger I had! It's thick and juicy, topped with cheese, bacon and carmalized onions. BUT the patty lacked a bit of flavour. Nothing salt can't fix.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK The new hood. Walk off the calories on the rail path - straight from Wallace Street. Great way to get to the main strip of the Junction."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  They're cash only and it's around $18 for juice and an entree.  I had their corn beef hash.  It was a little overcooked because the beef tasted dry and the egg in the middle was too.  I'm sure it would be delicious when done right and i would definitely return when the weather gets better for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow but if you're looking for a not too crowded breakfast place on a Saturday with good food and ambience conducive to sitting and catching up with friends for three hours, this is for you. Industrial and stark decor, but it works. It's in the junction which is a great part of TO. I ordered the  fruit and granola bowl with a lovely thick Greek yogurt. The granola was homemade and a little sugary for me. It had coconut and flax which was great,but the menu didn't mention it also had oats so I felt stuck once it arrived and I was too hungry to order anything else. The fruit portion could've been more generous with more contact with the yogurt: 3 thin Granny Smith apple slices, Handful of blueberries and two strawberries. The yogurt was unfortunately buried under the haystack of granola with the fruit in top as more of a garnish than part of the meal. I only ever eat a teaspoon of granola at home so half a cup was too much and too dry. They happily kept the water and coffee flowing. The prices were reasonable. One friend took the plunge and ordered the breakfast poutine, but couldn't finish it so it might be better as a sharing plate. There weren't fries, just potato chunks and gravy, cheese and then two eggs on top. The most bizarre thing were the green peas mixed in. Very strange. Everyone who ordered the classic breakfast was satisfied. One friend described her sausage as \"off the hook\" and told the staff it was the best breakfast she ever had.   The bathrooms were in a upper canada rebellion  era cellar and not terribly clean, so that was off putting and dangerous(the stairs were a bit precarious to navigate and the ceilings very low). So there are accessibility issues, but overall a great place to which I would return, perhaps for a late afternoon cocktail or dinner to see what the other fare is like."}
{"text":"Nice diner style, friendly staff, good food, great coffee. It wasn't too busy on a weekday for brunch with my parents. The single pane glass was a little too drafty for  us, but come spring, this is going to be a weekly destination, though maybe not with my parents every time."}
