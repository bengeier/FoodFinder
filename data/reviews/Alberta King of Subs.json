{"text":"Pure awesomeness.  Although I must admit, I never actually tried any of their subs, because I always go for the poutine with a pickle on the side and Spruce Beer. I'm not sure where else you can get Spruce Beer in Calgary."}
{"text":"I discovered this place a couple of months ago, and although I live at the south end of town, I will go to this place any day to grab a sub, poutine or smoked meat sandwich. The service may be a bit slow due to them making everything fresh, and somebody else said, \"a lot of love goes into the making of their items\"...............I say worth the wait. The place may seem pricey at first, but their portions are huge, and their fries are freshly cut, and fried at the time you order them. And I love the fresh smell of spruce, and so have a spruce beer every time - delicious. When I have been there, it has always been clean. Thank you for preparing such good wholesome food."}
{"text":"You can tell when the people who are making your food have a passion for making amazing food. Hands down the best pouting and subs Ivr EVER had. The gravy is everything you could hope for: colour, viscosity, flavour. The meat is perfectly seasoned and falls apart in your mouth.  I'm in love"}
{"text":"Since im not in the NE often anymore yesterday i did find myself in the area around lunch and i have always liked their Poutine and subs so i stopped
 the place has not changed even after the original owner from Montreal sold it,  The girls working the counter were nice and  greeted me fast, I placed my order in French  but the girl id not speak it,   I told her she should plan a visit to Montreal if working in a \"Montreal style \" Place plus she would love the night life there... waiting for my order i noticed a cap from my FAVORITE place in Montreal that i even reviewed before \" La Belle Province\" I only ordered a Jester Sub it was grilled to perfection like always and had great flavor i finished it down with white Cream Soda  next time i will take the spruce beer. When leaving a group of young guys cam in speaking french something i miss..  So if you are in the area make sure to stop by it is allot better then other places that claim to do Montreal Poutine, Till the next time im in the NE"}
{"text":"FIVE STARS for their grilled/fried topping subs true Montreal style. 
Five  stars for their poutine, great gravy.
Three stars for their smoke meat, it seems to have lost some flavour as precut and packaged as opposed to being sliced hot and fresh.
If in the area, drop in and give it a try."}
{"text":"Havnt tried the subs. Poutine is mediocre. The sauce is good, but the curd if they use real curd is not fresh and squeeky. If its not fresh and squeeky its not poutine!"}
{"text":"Been to Montreal and had the real thing.  This is it in Calgary, the best authentic Poutine you can find around.  Period.  Love the atmosphere, the people and the food.  Will I be back?  Of course I will."}
{"text":"Good poutine and smoked meat, but in my humble opinion not worthy of the many superlatives lavished on this place by other reviewers.  Nice melty curds in hot gravy, with thickish unskinned soft fries, but lacking the full Québécois menu and atmosphere of a place like La Belle Patate in Canmore to push it up to five stars."}
{"text":"Place is outdated but food is fantastic. I can't compare it with smoked meat in Montreal as I never been there. However, I will give this 5/5 for how juicy, flavoury and huge our meal was."}
{"text":"The King is Dead, the King is Dead! As a former Montrealer this was the best representation of a legitimate greasy spoon in Calgary. Well , that's over.....I was there for the first time in a while and it has been sold. The new owners have no clue what constitutes a smoked meat sandwich and poutine. The only thing that was authentic was the spruce beer! The loyal following will quickly dwindle and this will soon become a subway. Start looking for a new smoke meat joint and prepare for \"elevated poutine\" instead of the authentic offerings formerly available here.  I am so upset that this former institution is on its way to oblivion."}
{"text":"Little out dated deco, but who cares poutine amazing"}
{"text":"Actually went there today for Lunch instead of last night. Well worth the trip! Had the smoked meat sandwich and smoked meat poutine. I think the gas for my truck cost more than the meal. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"A few co-workers had decided to go here for lunch this week, when I asked what this place was, all they said was \"montreal smoked meat\".  Having been to Montreal many times in my youth and having searched the city for somthing similar, I was willing to try it.  

Holy Momma! This place is delicious.  I had the queen's platter, a 4oz sandwich with fries, pickle and a pop.  Came to about $13, what a deal!  

On to the meat...when you bite, there is no struggle, sliced perfectly the meat falls apart.  the mustard (your choice of dijon or regular, I chose regular but got dijon, sok though)  adds a kick to the whole experience.  The fries are made there, not sure if they are fresh cut or whatever but I ate every one.  The pickle wasn't anything special.  My coworker had the poutine, it looked so good.

This is only the tip of the iceberg for this place, the menu is huge!  There are hot/cold subs, poutine, burgers, hot dogs, next time I'm going to try the meatball sub."}
{"text":"Steamed or toasted hot dogs like we used to get at the Fourm & Olympic Stadium. Subs are good...remind me of Mike's (pizza/subs in MTL) prices are definately higher than in Montreal for the same food and 'ambiance' (La Belle Provence,...)"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! The food is so good and comes in massive portions. I have a hard time finishing my lunches when I order from here because you get so much! The Montreal smoked meat is delicious as well as their poutine. Anytime I drive by there during the lunch hour I always want to stop in for something. The people that work there are wonderful. I like that the kitchen area is kind of open so you can see them preparing your food."}
{"text":"Finally made the trip to Alberta King of Subs after hearing about their delicious poutine from those who did the poutine crawl a few months ago.  Poutine is one of my favourite foods, so I can be pretty skeptical when people make recommendations to me about it.

When we arrived, there was two people ahead of us and even they mentioned how good the food was!  So far so good then.  I ordered the full size (what was I thinking?!) hot dog poutine and my friend had the smoked meat version.  It didn't take very long for our orders and let me tell you, we were blown away by the portion size!  I wasn't sure I would be able to finish the meal by myself... but alas, it wasn't a problem (apparently I was hungry).  Each poutine was completely delicious - fries cooked just right, gravy tasty and not too salty, and a delightful amount of cheese curds.  All I could say was wow!  Craving satisfied.

Although it might be a bit of a trek to visit this place, it is worth it.  I didn't get a sandwich (who would have room?!) but the ones coming out for orders looked fantastic.  The service was also really friendly, which I always appreciate in places such as this.  All in all, a good experience and I can't wait to go again (although my waistline is fine waiting awhile!)."}
{"text":"Amazing poutine, kinda of pricey but you get what you pay for, the steak sub is hands down the best sub ive ever had!"}
{"text":"I'm not French Canadian, but I've eaten plenty of genuine Montreal Style Smoked Beef during my visits to Montreal.  This sub shop is as genuine as it gets,  and it's in the heart of North East Calgary.  We only discovered this shop recently, when a French Canadian friend of ours suggested it to us. 

Portions are huge.  And Delicious.  My hubby and I shared a Smoke Meat Sandwich ($9.95) and a small poutine.  I got a can of Grape Crush to drink, and the Mr. got a can of genuine cherry soda, imported from Quebec.  

The atmosphere is very authentic and by no means fancy (and I mean that in the best possible way).  There are mismatched maps of Montreal on the wall and lots of French sports clippings and posters.

The service was typically Albertan; warm and friendly.  

So, that's that.  Go there if you love hearty food, or have an unhealthy obsession with poutine like I do."}
{"text":"Really craved some subs and poutine

Their Montreal smoked meat poutine wasn't anything to write home about.  Gravy unflavoured.  Cheese curds were at least melting so that's a plus.  

Their subs were okay at best.  Soggy. Edible 

I like the hole in the wall atmosphere but it could be a little cleaner 

Expensive 50 bucks for two people. 
2 subs
2 drinks
Large poutine"}
{"text":"WOW! It's delicious, it's priced reasonably, they don't cheap out on portions, they do it the way it's supposed to be done, AND they have some personality! And it's in CALGARY of all places! WOOOOWWWW.

The fries are fresh, and properly cut and cooked. The gravy is real. They actually use cheese curds. And when you get a yul smoked meat poutine, it contains way more than a quarter of a handful of smoked meat! What a concept! 

I love it. There actually is hope in this city. It kinda sucks, actually, because this place demonstrates that (unless this place loses hand over fist in money every day) there is no excuse for food in this city being so expensive AND mediocre. Awesome awesome awesome."}
{"text":"Best smoke meat and poutine in Calgary, there are other foods although who remembers that when they have the best smoke meat and poutine in Calgary? :)"}
{"text":"The interior of this place feels a bit like a run down fast food chain or food court but man, good eats.

The staff are happy to see you and chatty. The cashier told us proudly about how many of their food stuffs come right from Montreal including the ooey goodness of the poutine cheese curds. They make the gravy from the smoked meat drippings which makes it robust with a salty perfection.

My French-Canadian companion said that it was the best poutine he had had in Calgary even if there was a certain something that he couldn't quite name missing and was excited to note how close it was to his house. I don't have any Montreal poutine experiences to comapare it to but enjoyed every bite.

The serving sizes were a good value for the price especially when you factor in the yumminess variable. Add white cream soda. Calculate for craving satisfied."}
{"text":"So disappointed. I used to be a regular, now it's turned into something I don't recognize. The fries were over cooked and hard to eat. The sandwich was ridiculously over priced. Sad to see. It will be my last visit."}
{"text":"Used to love going here as my hubby is from Montreal but smoked meat is not the same since new owners. Soooo disappointing as it used to be so good.  Only reason we would go back now is to grab a case of Spruce Beer."}
{"text":"My first time to eat here. I ordered take out; a medium sized regular poutine, montreal smoked meat sandwich, the queen size & a grilled veggie sub.
The montreal smoked meat was awesome. I'm not from Montreal & never been to Montreal, so I really can't say how true to the taste it is, but in my personal opinion,I liked how it tasted, it was pretty good. The poutine tasted okay, if not for serving it with burned & soggy fries it would have been better. I loved the veggie sub, however I asked for it to be made with brown bread but instead got a white one.
I could not send the poutine & veggie sub back because I only found out about all the mistakes when I got home, & my family and I are starving already so we had no choice but to simply eat what we had.

I'm giving the cook some benefit of the doubt since this is my first time. Maybe he was having a really bad day. I'll see if it's better next time."}
{"text":"My good friend and fellow food lover Olivia recommended Alberta King of Subs to me last year. We're both big fans of poutine and she had heard that the owners of this place are originally from Quebec.

I wasn't disappointed. If you're looking for the most original, authentic- tasting and looking Quebecoise poutine, plus the best deal for your $, Alberta King of Subs is the place to try! They use real cheese curds and their gravy is hot, thick and flavourful... The servings are huge too! Tastes like I'm back in Montreal/ Quebec. Plus, you can wash it all down with Quebec's equivalent of Pilsner, Labatt 50 (\"cinquante\") beer. Definitely worth the drive to the NE."}
{"text":"Simply the best smoked meat outside of Quebec. Worth the drive, don't be fools by the underwhelming frontage. The food is second to none!!!"}
{"text":"This place has an amazing poutine with proper cheese curds, overflowing gravy, and thick cut fries. It's one of the best poutines I've ever had and the portions are huge. I had the Montreal smoked meat sub with onions and it was the most delicious sandwich ever. The prices might seem a bit pricey, but they are SO worth it."}
{"text":"My all time favorite poutine place in Calgary next to the Alley Burger Poutine. This little gem is located in almost NE corner of Calgary near McKnight Blvd. 

I've been, for a long time, looking for a great poutine to satisy my poutine cravings and sometimes places like New York Fries is just not enough, I have to take it a step further, travel a bit longer just to make sure my stomach gets what it wants.

My friend and I decided to try this place out after reading review after review of how delicious the poutine was at Alberta King of Subs. So, during one awesomely awesome afternoon we decided to make our way there just to see what the hype was all about!

I looked at their menu, their sandwiches and subs looked delicious as well but my eye was on the prize, my mind was set and I knew what I wanted to try was their poutine so I went ahead and ordered a regular sized poutine, no special kind or variation just straight up old fashion style poutine.

First of all, the poutine came out quick so you didn't have to wait long to satisfy the quench of putting delicious french fries, gravy and cheese curds in your mouth hand over fist. The fries were done just right, not soggy like I find at a lot of other places, the gravy was the perfect thickness and not salty and the cheese curds, man, those cheese curds. The size of the regular was humongous I could hardly finish half of it but I tried, I chewed, I drooled the poutine slowly disappeared and by the time I finally finished it I thought I'd have to get carted out on a wheel chair...or stretcher."}

Ambiance: 2.5/5
Overall experience: 3/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

Located in what most Calgarians consider to be the \"ghetto\" (i.e. Temple), Alberta King of Subs is a \"hole in the wall\" eatery that serves authentic Montreal Smoked Meat and homemade beef jerky. I didn't give much thought to this place until someone on a forum mentioned they had one of the best poutines in Calgary. After that, my bf (who loves the dish) and I had to check it out. 

Don't expect anything too fancy once you walk in. It felt like a grundgy fast food joint with about ten food court dining tables and a front counter with simplistic display boards. The posters on the walls were faded, the tables weren't cleaned off from lunch, and the workers looked a little 'greasy'. Nonetheless, the place banged out some pretty decent food.

Their menu consists of a variety of hot subs ($7.95/6 inch; $12.95/12 inch); hamburgers/hotdogs; Montreal Smoked Meat sandwiches ($7.75/Queen size; $10.50/Reg size) with your choice of regular or Dijon mustard; and poutines with your choice of meat toppings. A \"small poutine\" is about the size of the smallest metal rectangle takeout boxes you can find, and a \"large poutine\" is the size of those metal circular takeout boxes. 

My bf and I ordered a Queen (small) 'Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich' ($7.75) with a small 'Traditional Poutine' ($5.95). I haven't eaten a lot of smoked meat sandwiches to know what is great or \"authentic\" enough compared to other eateries in Calgary. However, what I can tell you is that the sandwich came out hot and fresh with five...maybe six layers of \"fall-apart-in-your-mouth\" meat. Unfortunately, the sandwich fell apart with it because I was given regular Wonderbread instead of the traditional rye bread. The meat was light pink (similar to ham), and there wasn't as much spice as I thought there would be... it was borderline bland. The giant pickle that came on the side was warm and limp. 

On the plus side, the poutine was pretty good - a lot better than a majority of what other bars and restaurants serve. It's our second favourite poutine next to the one at \"Tudor Rose\". The fries were handcut and deep fried to a crispy golden brown, sprinkled with giant cheese curds, and drenched in perfectly seasoned beef gravy. They packed the container with as much fries as they could so the portion is perfect to share or solely eat.

Overall, the sandwiches were 'OK' but the poutine was what I enjoyed the most. If you're in the area and hankering for a hot sandwich or fries, then come here!"}
{"text":"The gravy leaves a lot to be desired. Just had lunch here today, ordered the small smoked meat poutine. The fries are good, cheese was plentiful and gooey, but the meat was fatty, and the gravy was lacking big time. Disappointing, as I read so many great reviews for the place. La Belle Patate in Canmore is still #1 by far, and I'd also recommend the skillet of poutine at the Toad n' Turtle."}
{"text":"Very good subs and steamed hot dogs! 
The gentlemen working at front is also very friendly and write my son's name every time on his hot dog."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, but bring your appetite or plan to share. The portions are MASSIVE. The hotdogs are small, normal schneiders size wieners. But everything else is really big. 
They advertise donairs but the lady behind the counter didn't know how to make a donair, so that was kind of disappointing but everything else is fantastic and they have MASSIVE kosher pickles which always makes me happy."}
{"text":"best smoked meat in calgary, from north to south to east to west.   prices are reasonable, and HEAFTY servings of freshly steamed smoked meat imported from montreal.  If i just need a buttload of meat with a little mustard and some bread to hold it, this is it."}
{"text":"I haven't been in a while, and I was a little nervous because some poor reviews seem to be cropping up.  As an ex-pat Montrealer, I have enjoyed this place since it opened (late 80s?).  They hand carve the smoked meat, which is juicy and flavourful - as authentic as I've ever had.  The fries are appropriately double fried (very important), the pickle is salty, tart and garlicky and the coleslaw is very tasty.  I loved the unexpected \"gift\" of an Original Jos Louis - brought back great memories of my childhood.  The gentleman behind the counter couldn't have been kinder.  He was working alone, but it was after the lunch rush and I didn't feel the wait was unreasonable.  This is NOT a fast food joint - expectations need to be adjusted accordingly. The only thing I didn't love was the \"light rye bread\", which is really white bread with indistinct brown flecks.  Traditional smoked meat is served on heavy rye bread, which is fairly dense, kind of a greyish colour and full of caraway seeds. I'm disappointed they've changed, but it's still a great sandwich."}
{"text":"Having lived in Quebec till I was 8. I still remember to this day the taste of Quebec!! This place is great for nostalgia sake if you miss home. However the price seems to be quite steep."}
{"text":"Used to eat here loved the fact that it was like back home until my family got sick from the poutine a few years ago. Hopefully they've cleaned up or changed management by now. I am still not likely to go back though, don't want to risk it."}
{"text":"Rightfully named for their delicious subs.

I stopped by Alberta King of Subs for a quick bite and didn't even know what I was getting myself into. The sub I had was a lot of food. It was very well made with lots of meat and toppings freshly prepared. I will not hesitate to go back and order from the nice staff again. The sitting areas aren't very comfortable though, so go for a quick lunch or maybe take-away.

Lots of delicious meat = great sub."}
{"text":"Pretty Close to the real deal. I little peice of Quebec right here in the 403"}
{"text":"It's not really a trip to Canada unless there's poutine involved. Unassuming place, 70s-esque decor. Smoked meat poutine had good flavor, though I would not call it profound. Good prices, good poutine. Not great, but sufficient."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a 5 rating because it is the Best Poutine in Calgary. The subs are just like what you would get back east in Quebec. It's outstanding. They don't need to draw you in with a fancy, slate interior and mood lighting. No need for hot young waitresses and drink specials. It's a dated shithole with quick, quality food. Maybe people from the prairies - west won't feel the same way, but these are tastes I miss greatly living out here."}
{"text":"food was pretty good however it took over 20 minutes and the lady behind the till was very rude"}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. Ever since new management the portions are smaller and quality is sub par. Used to be my favourite place for smoked meat but now they cheap out on the amount of smoked meat like just a few pieces. The old owner used to pile it on! Now it's terrible"}
{"text":"I've you were raised or spent any formative time in Montreal, you know that this place does their subs the way you're used to.

The only thing they don't get perfect, IMHO, is the bread, but everything else is deliciously perfect. 

Do not think of this as a Subway-esque sandwich. Think of it as a deep-fried, wrapped in bacon, topped with melted cheese piece of Manna from heaven.

And have a poutine on the side. Don't ask. Just do it. While delicious, for me it's the subs that keep me coming back time after time.

Yes, it's not in the best part of the city. Yes, what decor there is is dated and mostly tattered. Yes, the seats are uncomfortable. But oh my god does this place remind me of home."}
{"text":"This place changed a lot,their very over friendly but you can tell there not from Montreal and have no clue how the subs are made .They prepare it like subway.the smoke meat was served on lite rye bread .nice people but I can't go back"}
{"text":"I went in on a recommendation from someone, and ordered the Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich. At first impression, the sandwich was HUGE, and I had high hopes, but it was something of a letdown. The quality of the meat wasn't very good, the quality of slicing wasn't good at all, and the flavour wasn't right. 

It was a pretty decent sandwich overall, but for the price, I honestly expected a lot more, since I've had far better in several places for less money."}
{"text":"If you like warm greasy fatty smoked meat then go here now I bit into a warm slimy piece of fatty meat almost puked and there was onions on it and I wasn't told they put them on the sub I don't like onions barf but in the other hand the poutine was good but male sure if you get a large you have someone to share with it was 25.00 I'll never get back"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is amazing! Make sure you bring an apatite. 

The service can be a little slow when it is busy. But they put allot love into the sandwiches. I've tried allot of different kinds and I've never been disappointed. 

The regular poutine is huuuuge! You can share a regular."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm a little biased here, but I've given this place 3 tries now, and each time I was pretty underwhelmed, even to the point of being kinda scared.  I've spoken with the owners, and some other Quebecois who swear by this place, but I just can't get over the sandwiches' appearance at each visit, each time months apart from each other.  A Montreal themed deli, despite the Alberta name, they were for some time the ONLY place to get a real smoked meat sandwich in this town.  Sooo, when I moved to Calgary, it was on my priority of places to go (this was long before any of the other places opened).  
What I got, well, was a smoked meat sandwich that tasted ok, not as salted and spiced as some of the other places I've been to and reviewed, but still a decent sandwich.  I haven't tried the poutine yet, which is supposedly their forté, so maybe when I get the courage again.  
So, what you've read so far isn't all that bad, right?  Well, there's another reason why I was so non-plused each time.... the meat wasn't the vibrant red that a Montrealer would expect, but instead a dull off-putting gray colour, as if instead of steaming the meat, they boiled it for hours (boil a piece of beef and watch it turn colour).  Now if this was the event of 1 trip, I would be fair and maybe still try it.  But, I've tried this place 3 times now, and each time with the same result.  In food, you crave with your eyes first, then nose and finally the taste... well, they got the nose and taste perfect... but the eyes.... well... blech.  
Sorry guys, I'd love to give this place a great review, and yes it does taste good, but I still just can't get over that.  If every other smoked meat place in town can do it right, why can't they?"}
{"text":"Slow service, one guy making the food and dealing with the customers. Not quite the same as I remember since the ownership change. Food was decent. Got the Jester and the Throne hot subs. Also found the prices a little to high. $15 a piece."}
{"text":"For $10.24 I got a six inch sub. That may sound expensive but it was a damn good sub. In fact, this place has the best subs in Calgary in my opinion.

Yes, I lived in Montreal for eight years. I still visit. I still think Montreal has the best food. Like really truly amazing delicious food. All over the place. So probably you could get that same kind of sub Montreal for six bucks?

But I think the plane tickets today to Montreal from yyc are like 500 bucks. 

So I went with the king of subs. I usually eat the wild West which is steak and mushroom. Today I chose the princess, only 6 inches, which is steak and more steak. 

I usually order a 12 inch but the six-inch was damn good and filling.

What I like about this place is the first time I came here was 10 years ago and I still love it. I read a previous review that said maybe it wasn't consistent but I think it is. So good."}
{"text":"When we got to this place it was probably about 2 p.m. and they only had one girl working the till and making the food.. So it did take us quite a while probably a good 25 minutes to get our food because people kept coming in that she had to help.. The food was good the servings were big but this is definitely not a place to eat at very often as they are quite expensive.. I will try it again at some time to check and see if the service is a little bit better but definitely don't go during any busy times as the place does seem rather popular.."}
{"text":"My Candadian friend took me here for my first dose of poutine.  Fries+gravy+cheese curd=crazy delicious.  Also, homemade beef jerky? Yes please!"}
