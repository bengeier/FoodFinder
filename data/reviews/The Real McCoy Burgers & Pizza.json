{"text":"Amazing pizza with a good amount of cheese. The best 8 ounce burgers with pouting"}
{"text":"I found this place via Yelp on the way to the zoo.  At first I was a bit hesitant to go in cause the restaurant is in a run-down looking strip mall.  But I trusted the reviews and gave it a try.   The owner was very friendly and gave us recommendations what to order. We tried the poutine, home-burger, and pepperoni pizza. All very good. This was my first time tasting poutine and I could see why it's so popular. The owner gave us a few onion rings to try and they were super hot, crispy, and delicious!   The only thing I wished for was a place to sit and eat, or a large standing bar table. We stood at the end of the counter and ate our meal, which, apparently, is what people do there.    I recommend this place if you're looking for a quick place to eat!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised after trying The Real McCoy for the first time! We ordered the Mojo burger, a home burger with cheese, fries and drinks. We waited a little bit for our order but the staff was organized and the food was fresh so it was well worth the wait! I was really impressed with the taste of the burger, very flavorful and the toppings were fresh. Many people were also ordering the pizza, so may have to try it next time! A great local spot for a good tasting burger. I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Oh Yelp, you have steered me wrong. This place filled me with meh. One of the most average burgers I have ever had. No place to sit, everything looks a bit dirty...won't be back. There are better places within a short drive."}
{"text":"A friend recommended I try the poutine. It's real good, a meal on to it's self. They layer it so the cheese and gravy gets right to the heart of the fries. Last time I checked it's open late which is real cool."}
{"text":"Love the chicken sovlaki and Greek fries (had oil at the bottom of the takeout box, which am sure can be fixed the next order) amazing late night drunk on the go food."}
{"text":"I found this place this past Saturday after doing a Google search for \"restaurants around the zoo\".  A lot of positive feedback on the burgers and pizza so I figured I would give it a shot. I ordered the following:  8oz Home Burger - The burger was insanely good.  I grew up on burgers and I really can't remember having a better burger than this.  It was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The flavor of the meat and toppings were so fresh.  It really is a great burger and a true must have when you go.  Onion Rings - These onion rings are huge but be aware that it is 90% batter. Almost like a pancake batter (for lack of a better term).  I always drown my rings with vinegar so these were a hit with me.  Others may find it too doughy.  Pepperoni Pizza Slice - Yes, yes, yes!  This is your classic, handmade, home style pizza.  The crust is thin and crispy.  The sauce is smooth and packed with flavor.  Lots of cheese yet not too much so you can still taste the sauce.  Enough pepperoni for every bite and it doesn't overpower any of the other ingredients.  It was a perfect balance of everything.  The food itself is a solid 4/5 but what really makes this place are the people working there. They greeted me as soon as I stepped in eventhough the place was packed on a Saturday afternoon.  They were super friendly when it was my time to order.  Of course they don't know it was my first time there but they make you feel like you've been going there for years. The quality in service bumps this up to a 5/5.  Last Saturday was my first time going and I've been back once already.  I'm going again tonight (Friday) to try their fish & chips.  Three times in less than a week?  I think I may have found my new joint and it's worth the drive from Markham!"}
{"text":"First time to McCoy. Great burgers! Tried the Mojo burger and the Fish burger. Would definitely go back again. Fresh, though beef was a little bit burnt on the edge. overall taste good! Fish burger with decent size basa fiillet. yum yum with the tartar sauce. Really friendly owner. Support small family businesses!"}
{"text":"This place gets the 5 star rating for 2 things: the mono burger and their pizza. But those 2 things alone, it deserves it. It's really just for if you're in the area.  I used to live in the area, and I miss it. Of anywhere I've lived in the city, this was my favourite local pizza joint by far. Not great for delivery though - it was only only from Thursday to Saturday,  and let's just say there's no 30 minutes or it's free policy. I believe it's just Friday and Saturday these days. But it was more than worth picking it up. Nice and thick, lots of cheese and fresh ingredients.  For everything else on the menu - poutine, fish and chips, souvlaki, etc - it's pretty much average. What you can expect from a little neighbourhood joint. Not bad at all, but nothing remarkable.  But the mojo burger is a great burger. It boggles my mind that Johnny's is considered the iconic Scarborough burger joint. I guess because it's open so late or something. The mojo is a far superior burger than Johnny's frozen little patties, and McCoy's is overall a much better place. The owner and the workers are all great guys. Nowhere to sit down and eat though, and only a little counter space so it's more for takeout than anything. If you're in the area, check it out."}
{"text":"I grew up on their food and I turned out alright! Seriously the best pizza you will find in Scarborough in my opinion. Great, friendly staff, good prices. Curds or not their poutine is no joke - the gravy is exceptionally good and the fries are perfect.  Their burgers are quality homemade.  I've been eating their food for probably over 20 years now."}
{"text":"After reading such great reviews on this place, I just had to try it. I decided to go with the Mojo burger and Onion Rings like most suggest.  The burger was great!  It was 8oz, and it hanged off the sides of the bun.  Charred perfectly well around the edges, and juicy in the middle.  The onion rings however, were terrible. This may have been a one-off scenario, but it was chewy, too much batter, and too little onion. I couldn't let a single order of onion rings ruin my first review, so I went there again the following week, and ordered a large deluxe pizza. The pizza was fantastic!  It had a home-made style to it, and it was very fresh tasting.  Overall, 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger joint in Scarborough, very tiny location which is ideal for take-out obviously. There's like a stand up ledge if you wanna quickly eat there. Burgers are great i've been going here for years and its savior for being open late too."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Everyone who works there with such passion and care for their customers.  They are always greeting everyone so friendly no matter how busy it is inside.  The quality of food, their food preparation time and the prices are absolutely unbelievably great!!  They are open late every day so you can always go there for a late night bite. They serve sizzling burgers, cheesey pizza, fresh hot dogs,  yummy milkshakes, and much more!"}
{"text":"Friend recommended this spot while we were out east..it's a little hole in the wall restaurant I probably wouldn't look twice at if I was driving past.   Ordered a small poutine and a regular 8oz burger for about $15 which included a fountain drink. One of the guys waiting in there was raving about how great the pizza was and even offered me a bite of his food (dead serious). He said hands down \"best pizza in North America\".   The food was really good, the small poutine was actually bigger than I expected, I could barely finish my burger after eating the poutine. Burger was flavourful and juicy.   Be prepared to pay cash, they don't have any machines."}
{"text":"Delicious food with real ingredients, cool employees, what else needs to be said?"}
{"text":"I decided to go to this place based on the amazing reviews by everyone; however, this place was not nearly as good as I was expecting.   Now believe me, I am by no means a burger fanatic, but I've tasted a few good burgers in my life for roughly the same price range. The bun was alright, toppings similar to other joints, patty was a bit charred. Overall the burger tasted OK but not GREAT. fries were bland and seemed a bit dried out.. The fountain pop tasted a bit watered down? maybe just my imagination.  At the store I also noticed 2 things that made me think twice about going back .. first was one of the workers touched the underside of his shoe and then proceeded to use those same hands to put cheese onto the burger. Second, was the person at the register dealt with cash and without washing hands or putting on any gloves proceeded to assemble the burger.  Now if the burger was amazing then maybe I would've overlooked the unsanitary conditions - but like someone said before, the burger is OK at best. + sanitation issues = would not go back."}
{"text":"Their fries are amazing.  Need to try it for yourself and make up your mind.  I will be returning here often."}
{"text":"If you're going to lose your Premium hamburger and fries cherry this is the place to do it Lou passed the business down to George nothing has changed still the best burger joint if you stand in there and listen you'll hear people talk about coming all the way across the city just to come back to the real McCoy not just for the food for making you feel like you still live around the corner anyone who was anybody in Scarborough knew where the real McCoy was and was there on a Friday or Saturday night ,why even the Barenaked Ladies featured it in the video and it won mojo radios best burger of Toronto for a reason keep up the good work George!! be in to see you for a Mojo and fries again soon"}
{"text":"I keep coming back whenever I'm in the mood for something greasy and on the cheaper side. I haven't tried anything that's been really amazing, but it's all been good. Everyone's really nice there."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday evening. Great customer service. The man behind the counter was personable and funny, so it was very welcoming. We ordered a large pizza. It was great. Burgers looked good, definitely something to try next time. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Loved the MOJO burger. it was gigantic! My friend loved her veggie burger and the fries. Burgers were perfectly cooked, tasty and juicy. Very macho looking place but we did not feel at all uncomfortable. Staff are very friendly and the food is cooked to order.  The wait is not long. Lots of construction workers so you know that it's good!  I will definitely return. No seating but that's okay."}
{"text":"I just love this place, Home made burgers, (they have frozen as well) fresh cut fries, pizza, your typical burger relates items. Staff is friendly, and service is fast. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is there are no seats to sit and eat, just a short counter."}
{"text":"Went here based on the good reviews -- the place is small, really just a take out place with enough standing room for maybe 5 people to eat there.   We got the hamburger combo with fries and a drink. The fries were just ok, kinda greasy, but the burger was great. Not gourmet, but definitely tasty. It was a thin patty, but huge and the toppings were fresh. I really enjoyed my meal here and look forward to going back. The staff were also very friendly."}
{"text":"Sooo good when you want a late night 5 pound pizza to yourself :))  next time ill try the burgers.  The guys who work there are so friendly to !"}
{"text":"We loved this place so much we went 40 minutes out of our way to come back a second time!  We loved the pizza and the onion rings the most! We are from Michigan and we definitely wish we lived closer so we could have this more often.   They owner was extremely friendly and sociable which we liked and there was a young guy working there that we loved as well! Everyone was super pleasant and were a draw in for us.   Not really seating inside but we stood and ate at a counter table.   Definitely worth a try! You gotta have it!!!!"}
{"text":"First of all, I almost had a heart attack after driving by and seeing the mass construction. I completely missed the plaza and did a u-turn thinking that the construction site was the actual plaza. Thankfully, I was just blind.   Been here a number of times and it's still one of the best burgers in the GTA. What's great about it is that it's kept everything original. Their poutine too is very good and also one of the best in the GTA. I keep telling myself I'll try their pizza as I also hear only good things about it but I just always end up getting a banquet burger.   Only con about this place is that they only accept cash but then again, that's just keeping with the original."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Real McCoy since i was a kid for over 10 years now. My parents lived in the area previously, and have always loved it.  The food is simply amazing, and they have a wide selection to pick.  Steak on a bun, an 8oz home burger, chicken on a bun, you name it - they have it.   The prices are fair, but often are very pricey if you go with a can of pop and fries/rings with your burger.   The ingredients are always fresh everyday, as they get used up the night previous, so there is no leftovers. A bigger selection of sauces could be added, as I tend to add some of my own when I get home.   The onion rings and fries are made on location. Nothing frozen or store-bought. I've even seen the older gentleman make the onion rings. THINK rings dipped in large amounts of batter. PERFECT!   The general approach to how orders are taken could improve, especially on a busy Friday and Saturday evening. You basically walk in, and try to figure out who has had their order taken and who hasn't, then wait for an employee to assist you. Everyone stands anywhere, even some people place their order, then wait at the back. Maybe a simple queue line could be added, where you stand by the cash register, place your order, pay, then walk 2 feet and tell the guy what you'd like on your burger, then walk out the door.   My recommendation for quick food: steak on a bun, with fries LIGHTLY done, with gravy on the side with a chocolate milkshake.  If you're looking for dinner, I'd go with the simple home or mojo burger, and either the onion rings or a poutine, and again, a chocolate milkshake. This dinner pick is all HOMEMADE! You wont find this at a McDonalds or Harveys.   Everyone in Scarborough should go to this place. Trust me, it's worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Best burgers in the area. Make sure you get the home burger. Pizza's pretty good too. LOTS of cheese on them. This is my go to spot for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place out.  I've driven by countless times, but never stopped in, and I wish I had earlier.  Heard a lot of good things about the burgers so I tried a banquet burger.  Burger was very similar to what you get from Johnny's.  I would say in my opinion they are tied for the best burgers in Scarborough.  Will definitely go back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger joint in Scarborough, the basic chicken burger was a mere $3.50 and was much more filling and much better tasting than what big chains like McDonald's can offer for the same price. 10/10 would recommend. Definitely coming back later"}
{"text":"This place is a Scarborough treasure!  My friends and I used to walk here during lunch and would purchase their pepperoni slice.  I love it!  The other night after volleyball, I decided to stop by and grab 2 slices.  I totally forgot how HUGE the slices are!  I had to put away the 2nd slice since I couldn't finish everything.  I haven't had their burgers but I'm definitely going to try someday.  Poutine is also good.  Yes, it's not curd cheese but the gravy makes up for it. :)  They are not stingie with the cheese on the pizza.  They layer a good amount and the crust is always perfect!  Staff is wonderful.  I have not had anyone give me an attitude or a problem. :)"}
{"text":"Huge menu. From burgers, to dogs, to pitas, to souvlaki, etc. Good deals and the staff is really friendly. They also have delivery which is great too. If I'm not mistaken I believe it's open all night. If I'm mistaken, oops but I believe it's 24 hours."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The guys are awesome and friendly (especially Johnny T.). The food is beyond delicious and made the old fashioned way. Frankly, these guys blow Johnny's out of the water. The Real Macoy is a true Scarborough institution and the food holds up to that reputation. Absolutely awesome."}
{"text":"I was in the area and looking for a place that serves poutine.  This place seemed to fit the bill so I decided to head on over.  The street construction is an absolute disaster.  Unless you're familiar with the area, driving to their location at night might get iffy.  That being said, when you arrive it all becomes worth it!  The staff here are really awesome and they really do know their customers.  I kinda wished I lived in the area because I love restaurants that become integrated into the fabric of the community like this.  I ordered the small poutine and bacon cheeseburger for lunch.  I really didn't expect much but I was blown away by their poutine.  It was really delicious!  The gravy is top notch and the fries still retained a beautiful crispness.  No soggy sad fries here!  The poutine was topped with cheese instead of curds, but it was perfect nonetheless.  The burger was also really good and they let me choose the toppings for my burger.  I went with pickles, tomatoes, and lettuce.  Other topping options also include relish, chopped onions, and peppers.  Then came the condiments, I went with ketchup, mayo, and BBQ sauce.  They also had chipotle too if you're interested in giving your burger that extra kick.  Their thinly sliced pickles are a must have!  My last two really great food experiences had thinly sliced pickles so perhaps thinly sliced pickles are just my thing now.  Whatever you have for your toppings and condiments, you really can't go wrong.  In n out and shake shack are my favorite burger joints, this place  is now up there with them."}
{"text":"What can I say that I have not said except tonight  I tried  pizza  slice and Wow screw the big box joints.  This is my new pizza  place. Now to my Mojo  combo  after trying a few other burger joints this  is still hands down the best burger  around."}
{"text":"Amazing value and taste for how much we had to pay. Got their mojo burger combo and pepperoni and cheese pizza, coke for under $20. Mojo burger was fresh and juicy, simple yet hits the spot. Their bacon was a thicker cut than most places. Loved it  My husband had their pepperoni cheese pizza and u can literally see thick layers of cheese and on top of the pepperoni. The tomato sauce was def home made. Such amazing pizza for only $4.75 with coke. I just can't find anything better!!  The owner and her son were such chatty and friendly folks! Apparently people would air tight their pizza and bring it back to India!! That's how popular this place is!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic spot for late night crap. We ordered 2 large poutines, 2 whistles dogs with everything, 1 slice pepperoni and a strawberry shake. Holy %*$ it was good!  The poutines were made with grated cheese which is fine... As a Québécois I often suffer through \"authentic\" Ontario poutines made with refrigerated cheese curds... Barf. There's a reason why it's call \"L'Ontario\" (pronounced L'Honte-tario). Anyway, their poutine had lots of cheese and a cup of tasty gravy over well cooked fries... Crazy satisfying.   The whistle dogs were so packed with bacon, cheese and toppings that they were almost imploding. Definitely a messy but satisfying flavour and texture sensation.   The slice was an experiment. I was curious about their pizza. After trying it, we'll be ordering again soon!  Finally the shake. Excellent. Creamy and yummy for $3.50!!! This place was cheap!   All in all we pigged out with leftovers for $30. What's not to love!?"}
{"text":"Grew up eating here. My oldest had a hockey game in the east - took him here. He loved it. Next generation is onboard."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and very friendly service!  Get the Mojo Burger, it's awesome!  The onion rings are also great, and huge.  The poutine doesn't use cheese curds, so I didn't think it was that great."}
{"text":"The outstanding fresh cut fries are one of the key reasons why I keep going back to the real McCoy, a family run, low-brow, neighborhood burger joint. PLUS the homemade burgers, and especially the Steak on a Kaiser, are among of the best in the city, especially if you remember to ask them not to cook it too well done, which they sometimes do, like many Ontario burger joints, for fear of the food safety police.. Also worth noting, their fish on a bun and onion rings are both hand-battered in-house, so if you like old-school thick-batter style onion rings, as opposed to the standard frozen ones that 90% use, these will suit you just fine.   Tips:  - Only get the homemade burgers, otherwise you get a basic frozen patty similar to Johnny's and Harry's (yuck),  - poutine is not authentic, with shredded cheese instead of curds, but the fries are outstanding and the yummy gravy makes them delicious, if not quebecois-style :-) - onion rings are old-school, huge, greasy beasts thickly coated with batter - fish&Chip style - you either love 'em or hate 'em. - Pizza is hand-tossed, stone-baked real-deal old-school pizza - I always ask for mine with extra sauce and well-done for maximum flavour. - The place is a dump, the area is sketchy, there's no seating, only a stand-up counter, but the food is worth it.  5 stars James? Really? No, it's not that the place could not do more nor improve anywhere, but simply that in a sea of Johnny's and Harry's and Harvey's style joints, this place is definitely a cut above the norm, and very worthy of your burger dollars. Bottom-line, great joint, great food, great owners... just go, you'll thank me. :)"}
{"text":"Went here on reviews last month got the mojo burger with fries and gravy. Let me tell you this burger is very good! it lived up to it's hype! the staff was also very friendly/ the onion rings don't have that processed taste and the fries and gravy were a suprise very good the fries don't need salt! Went back  here lastnight around 10:30 pm (the real mccoy is open til 1 am) there was around 10 people in there so that shows you how good this place is. Went in lastnight got the homeburger with fries and a pizza slice and let me tell you this slice is epic good quality for $3.25 it will fill you up it's the size of a large dinner plate!  diamond in the rough in Scarborough best place for burgers and pizza."}
{"text":"Decent place although not worth another visit. The burger wasn't that amazing for the $9 I paid, hardly any toppings to choose from and I waited quite a while for it to be made. Didn't find the staff too friendly and the room is cramped with people and you can't even tell where the line starts or ends."}
{"text":"Been going here for 20 years and it still makes the best flame grilled burger in the city.  Even better than that is their steak on a kaiser melted mooooozzarella on top.  Absolutely love their pizza, as well.  I preferred their burger back in the day when they were hand pressed and a little more seasoned but they are still one of the best around."}
{"text":"It was pretty damn fantastic.  The Mojo is a burger with quality, classic ingredients. Nothing out of the blue, but the basics delivered at (or near) their best. Now would I call it the best in Toronto like they claim? Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Glad I went though."}
{"text":"I ordered the special McCoy burger and it was fantastic!! The burger itself had tonnes of meat and the bun was the perfect size for the patty, the bacon was cooked to perfection. Fries are good but not the best.  Since the place is a take out there was no seating but the atmosphere of the restaurant was still good and unique.   Burger lovers should definatley head over, the McCoy special is a must try!"}
{"text":"Mojo burger and poutine are bomb! Definitely the place to go to when you're craving for a mean homemade burger."}
{"text":"I come here quite often because I feel the portions they give are quite fair for the price. I very much enjoy the food they provide; I have eaten through the whole menu. My all time favourite would have to be the Mojo burger. Honestly, the Mojo burger is the only burger I can never feel hungry after eating.   Apart from the food, the presentation of the establishment is quite nice. When waiting for your order can clearly see the establishment's commitment to charity.  They have pictures of the local hockey teams they have supported over the decades and it's quite heartwarming. I highly recommend anyone who hasn't been here at least once give it a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Had the  cheese burger and poutine. Both tasted average. Nothing special about either and the poutine actually tasted too salty."}
{"text":"Ladies and Gentleman.. this place is a Scarborough legend. The Real McCoy is innocently located in a mini plaza corner and might look like a grease pit at first glance.. but don't judge a book by its cover, because everything from the pizza, souvlaki, burger and fries.. its all good baby!! One taste of their pepperoni pizza is all it will take and you'll know why they are called the Real McCoy.. My favorite is the large deluxe pizza that tastes even better the next day.. day old pizza that's the bomb!! where else can you make a claim like that?! I suggest you drop in and try them out.. since my review probably won't do the food justice."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in Scarborough you may have to wait a little sometimes but that's only because the burgers are cooked fresh so if you get there during lunch hours your going to have to wait. So call for pick up and save some time. I will go back again"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of positive things about McCoy, and have frequently passed by here. Decided to go and try it and I wasn't disappointed at all.   Their pizza is pretty good, and wow the gravy they have is just amazing!  If you love poutine and home cut potatoes this is a must try!"}
{"text":"There pizza is unspeakibly good. There burgers and fries are good too and there souvlacki is excelent as well.I largly credit their sucess to good prices, quality ingreedients and and a charcol grill. Be ready to either stand by there metal counter thing, sit on a curb out side or in your car if you want to eat your purchase. Still love their food"}
{"text":"The burger here is the best I've ever tried in life but it would be nice if the staff would keep the shop open until the advertised time on the sign and as per google and every where else advertised. Staff member stated \"It doesn't matter what the sign says. Go somewhere else. We don't care.\""}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cheap but quality burger- this place is for you! The owner is usually at the cash register, and the man is hilarious! The food portions are huge, and their fries are also equally as delicious as the burgers.  Note- no seating area and in a sketchy plaza with limited parking."}
{"text":"I lived next to this place all through high school, so my family ate here quite a bit. After a time they knew us well, so even though they don't usually deliver, they would deliver to us because we lived so close. Great service!   The Mojo burger and the Banquet burger are both huge, and I remember they had a few differences--but I liked both and would order either one. They had that charbroiled taste that made it way better than a burger you could get elsewhere.   The fries were a bit dry and bland, but I'd always get them with the gravy. It's a good place to go for lunch if you're from Woburn high school, because you can easily walk there and back. Then you'll simply crave them from time to time, and have to go."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time and was simply blown away. Passed through this place everyday but never realized there was a gem of a burger joint in that plaza. Everything about the place was amazing. The place felt and smelled like an actual burger joint. We ordered the Mojo and the Chicken on a bun. Both the burgers tasted great and were great value for the size. Will definitely go back !!"}
{"text":"This restaurant knows what it does well & sticks with that. After reading reviews I knew I had to try the Mojo burger, and it was delicious. Normally I'm not the type to get bacon & cheese on a burger, but I'm glad I did, as the bacon in particular added a nice smokey flavour.  Instead of getting fries we got onion rings, which were awesome too.  Just an FYI the burger is huge - next time I'll definitely split it with someone so I can enjoy more onion rings :) also as I'm sure you have already read in other reviews, bring cash and don't plan on sitting in to eat, as there is no seating or washroom.  This place has an awesome classic burger and I'll definitely be returning again!"}
{"text":"When a burger joint has been around for 50+ years, you can't help to wonder what makes it so special and really how good is the food. I have not disappointed from when I first stepped in here many years ago and i don't think I will in the foreseeable future. The staff here are some of the friendliness people you will ever meet. The mojo burger is satisfying until the last bite. The pizza is over loaded with cheese and I personally feel one of the biggest highlights of this place. The gravy served here is also something worth trying. Highly recommended and definitely worth a try if you ever venture into this area."}
{"text":"No seating, no bathrooms, no air conditioning, no wifi no upgrades in the past 50 years lol.. You didn't come for any of that garbage anyway right?  Just the best pizza and burgers in the city! Been coming here since I was just a boy with my parents (I'm 44 now) and still make the trip for the pizza and a mojo burger.  I've tried others, yes. Many. It's still the best."}
{"text":"It's crazy, I have lived in Scarborough for 15 years and only recently heard of this place.  It was mentioned in a nest burger thread on Chowhound and boy was the poster correct.  I don't drive, so getting there was a bit tough, since it is not anywhere near where I normally take the bus, but recently we headed there on a Saturday.  The restaurant is located in a small strip mall and is easy to see.  Previous reviewers mention there are no seats, but we were lucky enough to find a bit of a stand up counter to eat on.  For my first McCoy meal I chose the Mojo Burger (a really big home burger topped with cheese and bacon) a small poutine (the fries and gravy are awesome, there are no cheese curds though, just shredded cheese) and onion rings (old style, obviously hand dipped).  I was all delicious, and even though I have a large appetite I was unable to finish (even though I really wanted to)  The staff were all really friendly, and seem to be a family, it's nice too as they seem to know all the regulars (and there are many)  Service was quick, food was hot and delicious, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went there the other day for a burger.  Tried the Mojo burger.  Decent burger with cheese and bacon.  The price was reasonable. I also had the onion rings - the wife had fries.  The onion rings were hand cut and thick.  Very tasty onion rings however that sadly the equates to a few rings compared to the amount of fries per order.   The burger toppings are standard but as they also offer some Greek food items you can add tzatziki sauce to your burger.   The pros: They do deliver if you live close by They offer a decent pizza at a reasonable price.   The cons: They accept cash only.  No debt or credit There is not a lot of parking in the mall  There is only standing room to eat. No dine in.  When we were there some of the clientele were less than sober. Better to go during the day and less at night or order delivery."}
{"text":"This place is an old-school drive-in/takeout type of place. We have all been to one, char-broiled burgers, souvlaki, hand cut fries etc. However The Real Mccoy is a cut above most old-time drive-ins. Located in a small strip mall off Markham road this place specializes in burgers and pizza. I had heard a lot about it and decided to check it out, and folks it lived up to the hype.   On my first trip here I decided to go big, I ordered the mojo burger (essentially a bacon cheeseburger) and a small poutine (which was actually quite big). My burger was cooked to order on a charcoal grill, it was a large thin patty. This place allows you to choose your own toppings a la Harvey's. One bite into this burger and I was in heaven, the patty was nicely charred on the outside giving it a crispy crust (those little charred crispy bits on the outside were to die for and gave the burger a nice crust). The bacon was really crispy which I enjoyed and the bun was lightly toasted. The burger was too thin to really be juicy but overall was very good, with a nice smoky flavour from the charcoal.   The poutine was on par with the burger, hand cut fries covered in shredded mozzarella (not cheese curds) and doused with their home made gravy. The fries were also fried to order but much to my dismay were not crispy, the portion of cheese was very generous and the gravy was off the charts. The gravy had a nice light brown colour, was not overly salty and had a rich flavour with a nice consistency (not like that gluey crap most fast-food joints pass off as gravy). On my next visit I may opt for just fries and gravy as the shredded cheese turned really string and made the poutine difficult and messy to eat (cheese curds would make this poutine so much better).   Overall this place is a breath of fresh air among the recent \"gourmet burger\" trend, burgers done old school, everything homemade and the price is on par with any fast food joint. This place has no seating and a bar alongside the wall if you want to stand and eat but it would probably be best to get your food to go. I cannot wait to go back and try the pizza and their other offerings!"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this places sister just got the mojo and fries and gravy and I they are called the McCoy for a reason."}
{"text":"Another place i wouldn't suggest to go to if you're really craving burger unless you want grease all over yourself. Not only is this place very expensive but the place is a complete mess. Dirt and dust every where. There are no seats and no bathrooms. Which is shocking because after one bite of these burgers it will make you run to the nearest bathroom. The servers are not friendly at all. Don't except to receive a smile or a warm welcoming, it's all business to them. In over all if you want to pay a lot of money for a dirty, greasy burger and fries then you found the right place."}
{"text":"love this place! they have awesome kind people behind the counter and really authentic and wholesome american food. i really love the pizza here, and the burger i had was fucking insane!"}
{"text":"The Mojo burger was pretty good.   I would have it again if I found myself driving by here on a day I could eat a burger but it is not something I would seek out or have people from other cities drive out to try.  Burger aficionados should definitely give this place a try, many of you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Good pizza but here are some things you should know before going there 1) wait time: its usually long 2) sometimes you wont get what you want to order and work with what they have: i ordered vegetarian slice and pepperoni slice and after waiting a while, they said they still dont have vegetarian slice and asked me if i can just get cheese slice. i said OK because i could not wait any longer.  3) parking lot has some serious pot holes and can actually damage your car: they look pretty big and the property management isnt really caring about it probably."}
{"text":"I have dropped by The Real McCoy for a fantastic banquet burger (bacon and cheese hamburger) occasionally since last summer, and this past Saturday was no exception. The burgers are excellent, moist and tender, cooked right in front of you when you order, and served on a warmed sesame-seed bun. There's nothing special here, no unusual toppings or exotic meat patties, just a great burger with the usual; I always have pickles/peppers/mustard/bbq sauce.  I had previously heard about them, and eventually realized they are right around the corner from Centennial Rec Centre where I go ice-skating on summer weekends. I walked over the first time, and was admittedly a little turned off by the place; it seemed a little rough inside, in a drab strip-plaza. But I went in anyway, and the service has always been quite friendly; one guy even knows my usual order now.  I have also enjoyed their poutine, and have heard the pizzas are good but not yet tried one. Possibly the best regular hamburger in town, and I only pay $6.75 for my banquet burger. Cash only!."}
{"text":"The best pizzas in town!  And the service was awesome they made the pizza just the way we liked it.  Would recommend this place to any pizza lover.  Looking forward to try out the burgers on our next visit."}
{"text":"This place is great! Amazing service. Great Hotdogs."}
{"text":"This place has been here for so many years it's a staple if this community. The first thing I must warn you about is they only take cash!! I absolutely HATE places that only take cash!!   Having said that, the pizza slices here are huge, plus it has a taste of home made which is really nice. The hamburgers have a unique taste a homemade quality to it that I quite enjoy. Everything else on the menu like the fries are pretty average.  Remember they only take cash!"}
{"text":"My buddy recommended the Mojo burger to me and got me one.  He said it was an absolute must-try.  He was right.  This is a real burger right here.  The smell made me instantly hungry.  The taste...oh my goodness.  So juicy, so perfect.  Perfect patty, perfect bacon.  Pure perfection.    It was around $10 for just the burger and it was so worth it.  Never had a burger that good in my life.  Totally coming back here again. 5/5 for the greatest burger in Scarborough."}
{"text":"The is one of those local old school burger/souvlaki joints that is family run. You walk in and can tell that it's all original decor. As expected, this place is busy during lunch and dinner hours. Call your order in if you can. The burgers here are good but like anywhere else I would always recommend the home burger over the frozen, if available. They also do fresh pizza here. Slices are very popular here: pepperoni, cheese or veggie. I've yet to order a whole pizza but will definitely do at some point in the future."}
{"text":"This is the spot. Fresh pizza, fresh poutine, fresh burgers. Love it. Great pricing and large portions."}
{"text":"Played hockey with the original owner's son and he treated us well with hockey parties.  The burgers and pizza are amazing.   I attended Woburn HS just around the corner in the 80s and this was are place of choice for lunch. Fabulous all around esperience."}
{"text":"Very tasty homemade burger, you will see the distinguishable taste just for 8$.  I also ordered large pizza with everything on it for 20$.  Delicious!   Only for take outs."}
{"text":"Very tasty pizzas, I have never found better tasting anywhere in the city. The Homeburger is one item you must get there, I would recommend tzatziki, onions & tomato on a Homeburger...some say it sounds strange, but if pitas can taste that good then why can't a burger?"}
{"text":"I always say never trust old reviews so I thought I would write a new one.  This place is still great and I've recently tried their deluxe pizza which is amazing but be warned.  Its so loaded that it can weaken the box so be careful.  Still many odd things that could be changed, the Mojo radio banner gets more silly each year, the tiny tube style TV that hasn't worked in 15 years, the pictures of hockey teams so old those kids could now have kids that age and I don't know why they have an old picture of Roberto Alomar Meeting a young Saddam Hussein.  Great old style burger joint that's still very much worth a visit."}
{"text":"The Mojo burger, a Real McCoy signature remains to be one of my favourite burgers to date. This massive burger provides the necessity that make a perfect, yet simple burger; beef patty, bacon, cheese and then assorted topping options to create your ideal burger.   Service offered from The Real McCoy is friendly amongst all the employees and will actively talk to you and make you feel at home.  I will say that it is unfortunate that there are no seats that allow customers to sit down and eat inside the Real McCoy. My group of friends and I had to eat inside my friends car to enjoy the burger but that would not stop us from coming back. The area surrounded is not the cleanest and welcoming place but it is luckily located right off the highway exit."}
{"text":"This place is a bonafide Scarborough establishment.  I used to go here as a kid at Churchill Heights elementary school and was surprised to see that it was still up and running as I was scouring through Yelp reviews.    So when my 83-year-old grandmother had a pizza craving, I decided to drive out there and pick up a couple of slices.  As I waited for my pizza, I watched the guy serving (who had to be in his 70s), thank a patron for coming to the store for 41 years!  They chatted briefly about a neighborhood doctor they both had, before the other man went off on his way.  The service and atmosphere is truly that of your friendly neighborhood store, except with a lot of history.    My grandmother devoured the pizza slices and I tried a little bit and was quite impressed.  I can't wait to go back and try the Mojo Burger."}
{"text":"Best Burger In the City Hands Down Period !! I used to come here as a kid and when I lived in Scarborough back in the day all the time ... I moved out to the west end Mississauga when I got married and just recently came back here to eat wanting an amazing burger ... and boy what memories it brought back !! The place hasn't changed one bit ... Both In quality and taste and decor it's amazing ! The burgers are incredible , juicy and huge ! If your in the area or even in the West end of north whenever you are  it's worth the drive ...TRUST ME!! Get the home burger it's the best  Mojo burger aswell and poutine .. Even there pizza is bomb !! Try them out you will fall in love !"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. They have amazing burgers and awesome poutine. Their pizza is great as well. Mojo burger and poutine is the dinner of champions."}
{"text":"It's as good as it gets kids! Service is great; poutine and 8oz burger is out of this world however, this is not something I would suggest to eat on a regular basis unless you're wishing for a coronary artery bypass surgery. It is something you want to treat yourself here and there because of the richness in flavor and ingredients. Nonetheless the prices are reasonable and everything is fresh."}
{"text":"Unfortunately  the $8.50 + tax for the Mojo burger is OK at best. Holy chuck and burgers priest are much better."}
{"text":"Maybe it was just expectations vs delivery. Maybe I have been spoiled by institutions like Johnny's Burgers or the more recent Burger's Priest. I am not quite sure what it is but The Real McCoy definitely left me scratching my head about the reviews from other Yelpers.  Let's get down to it. DRY is a word that pretty much sums it all up. Yes, the burgers do taste as dry as they look like in these pics on Yelp; charred beyond comprehension. I can still taste the bitterness of the burnt bits from the patty; way over-grilled (don't believe me? check out some of the pics from other Yelpers and look at the patties carefully; burnt). I have read that the patties are freshly ground and made in house - while I don't disagree with that... however, it sure doesn't taste like what it sounds. Fresh patties are juicy and crumbly, these on the contrary are rock solid and dry. Maybe it is fresh but perhaps freshly made then frozen before being cooked.  The fries and onion rings are negligible; neither bad, nor great. Actually, the fries are unusually yellow and limp for some reason.  I really dug deep and tried to find something positive to say but all in all, I was pretty disappointed after reading so many rave reviews. The owner was a nice dude - that's about the only positive thing I can say about my experience."}
{"text":"Mojo burgers are awesome. I love it with tziki, lettuce and onions and I feel like i am back on the Danforth.  It's too bad you can't sit to eat in the restaurant but they also deliver."}
{"text":"Decided to check out the cheap eats in the area and ended up at The Real Mccoy, Initially was excited to try this old established local eatery and read some promising reviews on Yelp.   Driving home decided to pop in for a Pizza. This restaurant has obviously not changed anything about its recipes in the last 20 odd years, The pizza although ordered well done was under-cooked. The sauce was pretty average out of the can with a few cloves stirred in overall impression Pizza Nova could do better.  Few days later gave them another chance this time ordered some more pizza, burgers, Fries and Onion Rings.  Pizza this time was overcooked could not taste any flavour at all. Burgers were decent homemade quality. Fries were great and generous portions.  Onion Rings were not good the same batter used for Fish was put on the rings which made them look huge but just all batter really.  Would I come back definitely not."}
{"text":"This place is probably the best burger place in all of Scarborough that's not a chain. Real McCoy is better than Johnny's on Victoria Park for sure. I've had better and worse burgers, but if I'm in the area, I enjoy one of their burgers with a shake. :)"}
{"text":"It's a knock off of Johnny's with pizza no home made no cheese curds the onion rings suck every greasy spoon in this city beats this location burger shack square boy Johnny's even apache on the west does nothing great"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience after seeing all the great reviews. Prices are cheap and the food is pretty good, but nothing special. Just another burger joint. Take out only."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and being burger lovers I searched and found this place on Yelp. It's a small shop with no seating (only negative thing I could say about it). Staff are friendly, burgers are delicious and HUGE! We had the house cheese burger and the MOJO burger. Prices were very reasonable. Will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"We drove out here on purpose to try this place because of the great reviews. It's in a small strip plaza just south of Ellesmere on Markham road. Inside there's some really cool photos and things from way back which was interesting to look at while we waited. The owner is really friendly too.  The menu is extensive but in the end I settled on a Mojo burger - meaning that the burger is homemade. It comes with bacon and cheese and on all burgers you can add lettuce, tomato, relish, onions, and hot peppers. We also saw great things about the poutine so we got it too.   The burger was juicy and the portion was massive! Worth the 8 dollars and I couldn't actually finish it. Overall though it felt like a fairly average burger. But still definitely better than fast food burgers. The poutine was a bit underwhelming - they don't use cheese curds and the fries felt starchy and undercooked. We didn't finish it. Would I eat here again? If I was in the area maybe. Would it be something I crave? Probably not. Worth a shot though if you're looking for a good burger place."}
{"text":"We drove from North York to Scarborough to try the Real McCoy based on Yelp reviews of great places to find burgers and pizza. And we weren't disappointed. The burgers are awesome and we got a pizza to go.  The burgers totally filled us up -- so we'll have to dig into the pizza tomorrow -- it looks scrumptious and I know we won't be disappointed. The three gentlemen who run the Real McCoy are genuinely good guys and they threw in a treat for our first visit! We plan to come back and try their steak sandwich and chicken souvlaki -- and more! If you're getting off the 401 at Markham Road and are craving a great burger and fries at a really decent price, you MUST try this place."}
{"text":"Got the Mojo burger $7.49 The single beef patty was massive in size. Grilled to perfection with a nice crispy outer crust but still super juicy on the inside. Comes with bacon and cheese. The bacon was extra crispy but still had a nice chew to them. I don't think a simple bacon cheese burger can be made any better.  The place has been around for a while so its a bit run down. There are no seats available but there is counter space for you to eat your food while standing. Parking lot is small so if it were any more busy I'm sure the lot would be packed.   Service was excellent and very friendly. There were a few regulars that walked in and they spoke like they were long time buddies. I wonder how many more visits I have to make to become one of those regulars?  Before I left he thanked me by saying, \"Thanks little buddy.\" I'm pretty sure I was taller than him. It made me laugh and I really must take it as a compliment because I must look really young to him. I almost feel like a regular already.  The burger is a 5 star but the place could really use a face lift and some seating but they would have to tear down the hair dresser next door. And we can't have that happen. Or can we?"}
{"text":"Wow! Best home-burger I've ever had! Thick and juicy, dressed to my personal taste. It was so big I couldn't finish it all. In a little non descript strip mall just south of Ellesmere on the east side of Markham. Easy to miss if you're not looking for it. Well worth going out of your way for if you're in the mood for a great burger!"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing and I love their fish & chips. The guys there are always really friendly, despite some of the questionable characters they probably see at late-night hours."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out as the reviews on here seemed to be really good and I am a huge fan of supporting the \"hole-in-the-wall\" mom & pop establishments whenever I can.  Here are my honest impressions:  First off I noticed that the place was not that clean, in fact they had a pest control certificate displayed right on the wall for all to see, not sure if that's a good thing or not.  Secondly I noticed that the guys serving (and touching) the food did not have gloves on.  I witnessed one of the guys (the older one) scratching his ear and hair then touching the burger patty.  Same with the younger dude with the nice blue eyes, he touched the money then went back to touching the food...yikes!  As for the food, I ordered the Mojo burger and my friend ordered a slice of pizza.  She enjoyed her pizza, however I thought my burger was just ok, same with the fries and gravy...just ok.    Impressions- the place is not cheap, I paid over 11 buck for a burger and small fries with a water.  The burger was not horrible, but I've had much better from much cleaner places.  I think I'll stick with the other places."}
{"text":"The charcoal grill burger is very nice. But i dont like the fries there, it tastes like coming right out of the freezer.."}
{"text":"The burgers were good! I got the 8 oz mojo burger and it was huge. This place was a bit out of my way so I won't come back often. It's definitely a place that I'll hit up if I was close by.  The onion rings were alright. Like my brother put it, it doesn't have a processed taste. Yes, we're complaining that the onion rings tasted homemade. However, good homemade onion rings should taste like a fresher version of processed onion rings (if that makes sense to anybody)."}
{"text":"great mojo buger  -1 stars cause it takes long, and sometimes they really over cook the burger to a point it hurts when you swallow"}
{"text":"Cash only...   Been going to this place for several years. Great straight forward comfort food. Good variety of casual diner items from kaizers, burgers, to pizzas. Consistency of the food, service, portions, and the price is what brings me back.  Personally a big fan of their pizzas. Price is slightly higher than most places and there is that premium topping charge, but if you do the quick maths you get what you paid for. Soft crust, great base sauce no ketchup. Good amount of cheese and toppings. You just cant go wrong.   Would recommend and would go again. Only reason 4/5 cause its 2017 and they only do cash. Not feeling that ATM machine over at the Mac's."}
{"text":"This is an old school pizza and burger joint. People comparing McCoy's to fancier places downtown are missing the point. This is the kind of place where everyone is a regular and the staff feel like family.  I know some people who think that poutine with grated cheese doesn't count as poutine. I am not one of those people and so I think the poutine at McCoy's is fabulous - mostly based on the gravy I guess. The pizza is also excellent! I've never been a huge fan of the burgers, despite the attention they've received for the mojo burger. The onion rings are battered in front of you (not made from frozen!) and are really quite substantial.   Note: there is no seating here, and you have to stand at a counter to eat."}
{"text":"I just tried their home burger (8oz) and fries+gravy.  It totally hit the spot."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. The service is great too. The portions are massive. Most of the time I can't even finish the food. I feel bad going to real McCoy and asking for pizza"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza! Love the mojo burger & poutine as well. Good food for a good price."}
{"text":"I love their mojo burgers and fries. Their pizza is pretty good too. The only down fall is there is no place to sit. It's a take out joint but overall it's still a good place."}
{"text":"I don't know what the big deal is about this place. Burger was sub par and fries were soggy. Won't be back here."}
{"text":"Food is really good. Mccoy burger, poutine and pizza delicious! But they really need a dusting and a degreasing... Maybe just freshen up the place a little... Otherwise the food is great."}
{"text":"Pros: - Great food - Items made in house such as the burgers and pizzas taste great - Friendly staff - Food is real quality - Large portions  Cons: - Cash only  Ordered: Mojo Burger - Bomb Pizza slice - Bomb Poutine - Bomb  Conclusions: I've been going here for years. The food is consistently great and the staff are always pleasant. All of the items that I've tried on the menu are amazing including the poutine, mojo burger, pizza, hotdog, onion rings and chicken fingers. I have no real complaints about The Rea McCoy. I would highly recommend this place to anyone into burgers or pizzas."}
{"text":"I ordered the banquet burger and he ordered the whistle dog and we got a side of onion rings. Can I say that burger was HUGE and his hotdog was LOADED with cheese and bacon. Everything tasted amazing and I must say after all the burger spots we've been going to this one hit the spot.   While waiting both gentlemen were very friendly and personable. We told them it was our first time and they right away told us what we need to get the next time and handed us a take out menu.   All around a 5 star for both food an service. My ONLY issue was there were no seats. I understand it's a small spot and I get it, but I'm just saying you guys were amazing and perhaps think about expanding to accommodate seating.   Thanks for a great time!"}
{"text":"Take out place with the best poutine. $5 small   Got the famous mojo burger combo $10.50 comes with fries and a pop (we upgraded to the poutine). It was pretty damn good.   The burger itself was alright -- it came with bacon. So that's a plus. Nothing to rave about though. Just a good burger!   The area is a bit sketch but they sure did deliver on the food. Pretty fast service, got it in 10. Ate in the car as there's no tables. The poutine was so damn good. No cheese curds but damn the cheese was so melted and hot. YUM."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY.  I'm not a health nut, but even I can say this food is pointless.  An overload of just grease with no taste to compensate for it.  Had the veggie burger, onion rings and fries.  The onion rings were humongazoid. It was like three huge rings and two small ones. It would have been good if they added more salt to the batter and fried it a bit longer bc it was kinda chewy. It was very bready, a la chinese restaurant chicken balls type batter.  But if ur looking for a tasty meal that your body will feel good with after, this aint it.  Id say youd feel better after Harveys.  O ya and I asked for no mustard on my burger but they still put mustard.  Honest mistake. Not the tastiest burger.  The staff there is nice tho!  I wouldnt recommend it overall for taste and health reasons."}
{"text":"The wait is a little bit longer than your fast-food chains - however, it's worth it.  The burgers are juicy & slightly charred + the gravy is rich and even makes the fries (which are meh) taste pretty good. The pizza slices are thin but for some reason they're delicious.  Well worth it for the price."}
{"text":"I have been going here for 15+ years, a definite recommend. Great service, awesome atmosphere, and great food!  Recommendations: Mojo Burger (Duh), the Pizza (Drool), and their Milk Shakes (falls on floor, shakes cause its that good.)"}
{"text":"2 Mojo Burgers, Poutine, and 2 coke.  The poutine was yuuuummms! Loaded with fatty cheese and hot gravy. So good. The Mojo Burger was pretty good as well, but mine was a bit dry. Johnny's Hamburger still remains my fav burger joint. But do come here for their poutine..they'll spoil you silly with the gravy ;)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Mojo burger is really yummy. Their fries are always freshly made and milkshakes are bomb!  *ONLY CASH*"}
{"text":"It's funny, I used to live a block from here when I was in high school and never bothered to check the place out. It took me visiting from California, waiting for a friend to get a haircut next door to check this place out.  By far one of the best burgers I've ever had. Better than a lot of pricey places I've been to in California."}
{"text":"Real McCoy Burgers and Pizza is located in one of this tiny tiny strip plaza at Scarborough. One of those sketchy places I would not have visit in the middle of the night (BTW, they opens till 1 AM, but closed on Sundays if you want one for midnight snack).  Dropped by on a Sunny weekeday afternoon and this place is hopping with action. I do feel a little out of place in this little burger takeout place. I am the only female there... Can I tell them yelp sent me here??  The gentleman at the cash is super nice. It is fun for sure to look at how my patty going up in flame and yes burnt marks.. (I can hear my boyfriend telling me how unhealthy they are....) I ordered the 8oz Homestyle Burger Combo with onion rings instead of fries ($6.49).   Homestyle Burger - Nice and juicy. Charcoal with burn marks. Yummmm 4 stars Services - All the people that works here are so nice and friendly. 4 stars Onion Rings - meh... Sorry don't like it ... the batter too thick and heavy for my taste, will skip that and order just the burger or the home made fries instead  Will be back for sure to try the MOJO Burger!!  Cash Only!"}
{"text":"Scrumptious Greek fries, pizza, and steak on a Keiser.  Inexpensive and worth every bite!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza I have had in Canada.  I went here last night after reading the reviews, and the fans are right, this is awesome pizza! I ordered an extra large (and it was, AND heavy) pizza, and onion rings.  The rings were thickly battered, and so good, they needed no ketchup. The pizza had a nice doughy, bendy, NY style crust, with lots of flavor.  The toppings were plentiful, the pizza was not greasy.  The toppings went almost to the edge of the pizza, so not much excess crust.   There was a bit of a wait since we didn't phone ahead, but it was well worth it.  The menu is pretty basic.  The service was friendly, and they made you feel welcome and right at home as soon as you entered.  Oh, it's cash only!  This is my new favorite pizza place!!!"}
{"text":"After reading a number of reviews for this burger joint, we decided to make a trip to Scarborough to check it out. The area is kinda sketchy, but don't let it throw you off.. good for late night grub, as its open till 1 am daily.  This place provided great service with super friendly staff. It is a take out only restaruant no places to sit. Free parking.  On to the food; we had the homemade burgers with and without cheese. These burgers were great, huge sizes, potentially enough to share between two people. The meat was fresh, moist and juicy, not thick but still good. The bun was perfect! not dry or stale, perfect size and softness. Condiments were also fresh.  We also got a side of Poutine, the large poutine is definitely sharable; mediocre fries, great amount of shredded cheese and perfect dark, hot and rich gravy!  Overall I would visit this place again, and maybe try the pizza next time! Definitely worth visiting!"}
{"text":"Super great food, available at an unassuming little joint. The veggie or cheese pizza straight out of the oven is soooo good! Crispy crust and stretchy melted cheese for less than $5 for a huge slice. The burgers are pretty great as well, but I'm more about their pizza. Not much seating, definitely more of a take-out place than a restaurant, but the food is well worth it! Huge onion rings with an incredibly crispy crust are also definitely worth it"}
{"text":"Got the large poutine and you can taste how frozen it was. (Undercooked, and I'm not the only review that says this) They also do not use cheese curds and their portion is smaller than average while the shop owner was saying it was so big that most people couldn't finish it. Gravy was the only plus point but everything else tastes like it was served by my blind cousin who doesn't cook."}
{"text":"Great burgers great poutine awesome pizza... Tried it all and always happy with our meals."}
{"text":"Tried the homeburger combo.  Fries were great, not greasy and obviously fresh.  The burger was good but not memorable.  The pizza looked good so I will be back to try couple other menu items.  Staff was awesome and friendly.  Nothing I'd drive out of the way for but compared to any fast food options this wins hands down."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, but not the best I've ever had. Can't compete with the old Marino's from when I was young  Got to get the mojo burger though. Excellent burger, comes in a bun that is cut in the clasp style. Keeps the hands a little bit cleaner"}
{"text":"Love the pizza and burgers here. No bells or whistles. Just simple and satisfyingly delicious. Onion ring are massive.  Inside you see all these clipping and memories on the walls. Shows how long they've been part of the community.  Anyone who grew up in Scarborough will know this place."}
