{"text":"These guys are cool. If you don't frequently shop at MacTaggarts, you are walking too far, you dont live in the 'hood, you keep it extra kosher, or else maybe you didnt know about the coolest place to find practically everything you need in a convenience store... You can even score food for your neurotic feline friends, and stuff to tidy up the ol' litter box."}
{"text":"Good juicy sandwiches, but the bread is a bit too soft (I like mine more dense). They have a good deli and beer selection, and a fairly good amount of junk food goodies as well. My best description of the place is that it's a slightly higher class 7-11, but without the slurpees and the hot dogs, which is pretty disappointing. The cashiers and deli people there are quite nice though."}
{"text":"I love this place! They are at a great location and are open for most of the day. They sell a wide variety of basic \"grocery food\" along with making their own food. They sandwiches are amazing! Plus many of their items are from other Wisconsin business. I would highly recommend going here to get great food or just to stock up on some food items!!"}
{"text":"Buried in a nondescript little basement in a back alley, frequented only by the frat boys and sorority girls who know of its existence. Tags' gooey breakfast sandwiches, juicy subs, salty (and free!) popcorn, and oversized cans of Monster were the only thing that kept me going when I used to live on Langdon Street.  And honestly their subs kick the crap out of Pinkus McBride's subs. Despite the fact that the two delis use the same ingredients, Tags just knows how to make theirs so much more savory (edit: it might be the bread. Or the better/cheaper ingredient selection. But yeah it's probably mainly the bread)."}
{"text":"Oh, Tags. I lived around the block, and hot damn, I wasted so much money here on god knows what. Probably just candy, chips, pop and gatorade.  But so did all the other frat guys and sorority girls, so I feel okay. Corned beef sandwiches, mmmm. Best place on upper Langdon... well... *only* restaurant on upper Langdon!"}
{"text":"MacTaggarts is the best. Enough said.   The prices are a little steep, but that's understandable based on where they're located. They have pretty much everything you could ask out of a neighborhood market: cool tunes, great employees, and Boar's Head everything.   They have an underrated selection of different micro-brews as well, which is (imho) a huge plus.   Only thing you need to look out for is their half step coming up and down the stairs (if and when you're there, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about).   Stay cool \"tags\""}
{"text":"I forgot about this place until I saw it on Yelp!    Great place to blow your money when you've had a little too much to drink, or so I've heard.  Lots of good junk food.  Staff was always nice."}
{"text":"Great cheap beer selection and BECs! This place has everything to offer from bacon egg and cheese sandwiches (late night) to beer! FREE popcorn. FRIENDLY staff. BOARS HEAD meats. The staff get to know people personally and try to make your experience as quick and easy as possible! A similar place to wawa! Definitely going back. Creativity: 10/10 Atmosphere: Frat Price: $ Quality: For what it is 8/10"}
{"text":"Staying at the Lowell Center, I was thirsty and wanted a newspaper (since I missed the free ones at the Lowell. Going to State Street one is forced to run the gauntlet of pan handlers.  Walking down Langon Street was quiet and quick.  The store is kinda secreted in the basement.  Nice little deli and convenience store.  The gal that waited of me was very nice and laughed at my attempt at humor.  The store had everything a college student could ever need.  A  functional deli was on hand to make, what I hear, great sandwiches.  It's a bit of a secret to the students in the area, as it is tucked away in fraternity row. If you're hungry or thirsty or want a cold beer seek out this little gem off the main drag in Madison"}
{"text":"I get at least 8 meals a week from here. Deli that doubles as a convenience store? I'll hit it every time on the way home from class. I'll stop in when I want a drink. They make great sandwiches and the soup/chili is amazing. Anything you could need as a person living in Madison is at MacTaggarts. The employees are also very chill and friendly. Make sure to say what up to Chuck. He's the homie."}
