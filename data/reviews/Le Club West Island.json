{"text":"Our youth soccer team had a game here, and the actual playing area was great. However, on a recommendation from the host team, we made reservations for our whole team, with family members, to eat in the restaurant following the game. Despite our having made the reservation a week ahead of time, they were completely understaffed and disorganized. Many of us sat and waited for more than 1.5 hours for our orders. I cannot recommend this restaurant for large groups."}
{"text":"The restaurant at Le Club West Island is excellent. Quality, quantity, pricing and service are all great at this west island sports bar. Try this place you won't be disappointed. Coconut shrimp are recommended."}
{"text":"Nice relaxed restaurant/bar. Great happy hour 3-7!  Nice big, half price chicken wings both Monday and Tuesday nights. Tuesdays feature the Spice Boys hot sauce customers that bring their own sauces. If you have any favourite sauces come and join us around 6-7 pm!!!"}
