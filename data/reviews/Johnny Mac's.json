{"text":"We love this place.  We just moved to Henderson and  was looking for a local place.  We hit the jackpot here.  Their wings are incredible and pizza is awesome.  Weds. Night is half price pizza night.  We try to go every weds."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and double baked wings! Wish they would open a second location near downtown Las Vegas or towards summerlin"}
{"text":"Awesome wings, good pizza, good enough service...nice overall neighborhood pub..."}
{"text":"A friend and I use to go to the place all the time in HS. We use to buy coupon booklets from the Foothill HS Wrestlers. They always had a JM coupon in it... Brings back good memories..   Few months ago I had family in town and thought this would be a good place to go. WRONG. They forgot to write down my 15 ppl reservation.. We had to wait forever to be seated and then another forever for our food.  My dad loves the place and wanted to go there for his birthday.. Guess what, THEY GAVE OUR RESERVATION AWAY!! We weren't late.. Another big party (that they forgot to write down their reservation for) just so happened to show up before us. So they gave them our reservation! We had to wait for over an hour AGAIN! Then of course our food took awhile to get to us. I know we had a big group but it was a LONG time. Luckily our server (female) was great and very nice. She remembered my dad from last time (I thought that was cool).  The food here is ok. Ranch is good. Fried zucchini & sauce ROCKS. Pizza OK. Family loves the watermelon & suicide sauce for the wings.  Also, the place is too dark."}
{"text":"This is the \"Cheers\" of Henderson!  Always good food and friendly service.  Their wings and pizza are the absolute best.  Can get a little busy on game nights/days, but it just adds to the ambiance.  You can usually find Johnny filling in here and there, making sure everybody is taken care of.  Even if he is from New York, he's a great guy (LOL)  Love the food, love the atmosphere, bring your friends!"}
{"text":"I love the wings. But...$20.00 for two people, really! The service is SLOW."}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings in Henderson! Try the wings double baked! I love this place! The staff are very friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Great place for food and drink. Been there many years and your treated very well by everyone. Love going there"}
{"text":"Being from buffalo ny my husband and I were so excited to discover johnnie macs. The food is so much like home. If you've never had an authentic beef on wick then this is the place to try one. The staff is so friendly and it's great to find a neighborhood spot with great \" back east\" food."}
{"text":"Food is great but there's a miscommunication with the staff and the kitchen . I asked for a water and the server asked another server to get it then We order our food at 6:45 didn't get our food u till 8:10 we kept getting excuses as to why our food was so late . I believe the server forgot to put in our order . But she came and blamed it on the kitchen . Either way it took way to long for our pizza and shrimp pasta . Unless they went fishing for shrimp and hand made the pasta there's not a reason to take that long. Thankfully they comped our meal . We did appreciate that . Could be a great place to dine if it had better service ."}
{"text":"Had craving for pizza, and I'm new to Henderson so I asked where to go by some local and Yelp. They all told me Johnny Mac's. The place is located in a strip mall next to a Smith Market.  The place has great atmosphere and really good Bar. If you like beer, sports, and video poker then Johnny is the place for you. They advertise NYC pizza, not true. Pizza was Ok, had the special.  Little over priced and doughy but ok. Haven't tried the many other dishes, but all the people where in there where really enjoying themselves. If you want NYC pizza, then Johnnys not your place, but if you as Cheer type place to go. Then Johnny your place"}
{"text":"Awesome bar outside of the madness of the strip,   The pizzas are amazing as well as the burger selection,    Big doors open the restaurant up to a nice outside breezy setting.    The servers and bartenders are all friendly,  these are reasons why I'm in there once a week,"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas and very happy to report we had a delicious dinner here at Johnny Mac's. My husband loved the Spaghetti and Meatballs, and our friendly waitress, Tricia, kindly pointed out that it was two-for-one night on his order, so for just a dollar more, he received a second full order to take home for tomorrow. Woohoo! My order was more complicated: I'm allergic to wheat, so no pasta for me. I ordered the California burger, no bun, and asked if the chef could put chopped garlic on my French fries because I can't eat garlic bread. No problem at all, Tricia told us. And extra veggies with my burger, some ranch dressing on the side? Yes, indeed. Our meals were served hot and quickly, and that's the best beef burger I've had in forever! My fries were perfect! I asked Tricia to please let the chef know how happy I was with my dinner and the extra trouble they went to for me. These folks are the best! They really want you to enjoy your dinner. Thanks everyone at Johnny Mac's!"}
{"text":"Great Place!  We were a large group of 28 in town for a soccer tournament.  This outstanding place accommodated us on a busy Sunday afternoon full of football games.  Despite the crowds the service was outstanding and the food fantastic!  We couldn't thank you more!   Thanks from San Angelo Extreme FC from Texas!!"}
{"text":"Service is awful. Servers have no rhythm and its ridiculous having 5 people ask you if you want something. Food is excellent!   Tea is horrible. Soft drinks are flat. Water tastes like toilet water.   Salad is excellent. Fingers excellent. Ravioli excellent. Philly and club excellent.  Great atmosphere. Love the doors rolled up to get fresh air. No smoking even better!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Our son graduated last night and a couple days ago I had gone up and asked if they could accommodate a group of about 15 and if they could put up some decorations we brought. They said sure but customer service being what it is now a days I wasn't sure... we got there last night and not only the table was decorated, they added to them !! Apparently ours had gotten wet so they went to the store and bought more !!! The service and food was phenomenal! Thank you for making our last baby's graduation night special ! You rock!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on the way to Vegas to eat once and I could say the food is great, service is good and bar is enough to get drunk ))"}
{"text":"My first time going to Johnny Mac's was when I was a little dweeb of a teenager ditching school to get pizza and wings with my friends. Now, 11 years later I still go to this spot to get pizza and wings only now, I bring my own little humans along. The service has been hit or miss over the years, but hey, ya can't win em all! I love the atmosphere and food here enough to put up with the endless Broncos and Dallas fans haha. All in all, this will always be a favorite go-to for a beer and bite. It's such a well known Henderson spot that you'll even find an officer or two in the building stopping in for lunch. We love our boys in blue!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. The pizza is so absolutely disgusting I couldn't even finish a slice. I would have been better off going to Costco or going across the street so sunset pizza. The wings were dry and so tiny. We asked for blue cheese but it tasted more like sour ranch dressing. Overall it was a huge disappointment. I love supporting local companies but some just aren't worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome food and staff.  We ate here during a baseball tournament and brought the whole team.  They accommodated the whole team and parents.  Pizza and wings combo was a hit.  Cheap beers and multiple TVs for sports watching.  Thank you for a great time.  Trisha was our server and was very curtious."}
{"text":"Finally after 3 years in Las Vegas, I have found the perfect beef on weck!  Excellent! This was our first time at Johnny Macs, and I couldn't have been more pleased. Sandwich was incredible, wings were great, and our server Katie couldn't be more helpful! Prices are a bit on the expensive side (I think), but well worth the great food, and customer service. Anyone in the metro Las Vegas area looking for beef on weck, I strongly recommend Johnny Macs!  Heads up, I believe this sandwich is only available on Fridays, Saturday, and I'm not sure about Sunday. Kudos to our server Katie! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"You've got to try the watermelon BBQ sauce on something. I had it on the wings and wish there was room for the ribs. Sounds weird at first but the watermelon isn't over powering or too sweet."}
{"text":"Food is good wait staff is great !! The bartenders work their a s s off! As a bartender myself I noticed  there was no mats on the hard tile floor!! This is against osha I believe .. I will be calling Johnny himself to complain.., You make a ton of money on the backs of your great staff and you can afford mats!"}
{"text":"I fluctuated between 3 stars and 4 stars because I think they're a 3.5 if you take into account 3 means \"A-OK\" and 4 means \"Yay! I'm a fan!\"  So consider me a 3.5 which would be, \"The food was good with a lot of potential to be great and I really WANT to be a fan.\"  The review stats are interesting & always help put a perspective on things. For instance on Johnny Mac's, 2/3rds of the reviews are 4-5 star. 1/3 of all reviews are 3 stars and under. So that basically means 1/3 of all reviewers were not happy with their experience in some way, but the majority were. Also of the total amount of their reviews, 1/3 are by Henderson locals. The graphed trend for 2011 is going down. Of the 5 reviews for 2011 thus far, 50% are 3 stars or less & complain about service. Not sure why this trend is happening there. So enough about number crunching their stats, how about the nitty gritty of my own review?  So how did I arrive at a 3.5? Details below. ---------------------------------------  Our table ordered a Jalapeno Cheeseburger w/fries for $8.95 and the 2  slices of pepperoni(or cheese) with a soda for $5.99.   The main points are this:  1) The food runs from good to outstanding depending on what you order.  2) The service is spotty  What this means is you'll have to know what to order in order to have a fantastic meal, and you'll have to forgive the spotty service. Think of it as offering BAR service, NOT restaurant service. Just flag down a server whenever you need something, because are always busy. Do not expect automatic drink refills, asking if you need anything, if you want dessert  or to have your plate removed after you are done. If you get it, great! If not, remember 30 percent of all their reviews talk about the food and/or spotty service. So just don't be surprised when it happens to you. There is a good chance it will. Just learn what to order and lower your dine-in service standards.  The spotty service does irritate me but depending on mood I'll still eat here. How I adjust for it, is in the tip. I tipped 15% this last time but wanted to tip 10% because my server literally did the bare minimum. I didn't but should have. I just always feel weird tipping only 10% but if it happens again I will.   We entered and stood for a few minutes because the servers were busy. We offered to seat ourselves at a high table instead of standing around. No big deal, it's a casual place. After about 5 minutes we got our menus and gave drink orders. Our order took 15 minutes.   The burger patty(med well), cheese sauce, bread and fries were A+. The jalepeno slices on the bottom made the bun fall apart when I held it because the juice soaked the bun and made it taste overly vinegary. So I ate the burger with a fork and knife open faced style and disgarded the bottom bun. If you order this ask for jalapenos on the side.  The fries are aweeeesome. There were none left when I was done. Lots of crispies. Yum yum give me some.  I don't have an opinion on the pizza because it wasn't mine, but they loved it and ate it all. Just FYI, when you order the 2 slice deal, the pizzas are baked whole and sliced then stored in a 3 tiered rotating, heated, glass display. They are not cooked to order.  Total came to $16.15 with tax...but with tip was almost $20. Ouch. Right now with the lack of service I don't think paying full price here is worth it. There are lots of other places I can go for 1 burger & 2 slices of pizza for 20 bucks and get a better experience.  HOWEVER, on a half off pizza night or coming with a coupon would be worth it because for a discount I am willing to overlook the lack of service.   When we got the bill, that is the only time our server, Jemma/Gemma, came back to our table after delivering the food.  If you're here to watch sports for lunch you're out of luck. They have all of the TVs on but volume on zero with NO SUBTITLES. Music plays in the background (80s-90s laidback mix).   There is a full bar.    ==============================  If I could figure out, what they are known for, I can see this review becoming 4 stars. They really are good for basic bar food.    Tips: -Order the fries over the onion rings. -order the regular burger over angus (I've had both and angus is too mild. it's juicy but the beef taste is stronger on the reg. burgers. -order wings but if you don't want dry wings, perhaps order extra sauce. A lot of the reviews say the mild is tasteless. Perhaps order medium. People also seem to really like the hot. Expect less sauce than you would get at other places but the wings are meaty. You can also order these \"double baked\" which means they bake them in the pizza oven after deep frying. I assume this sets the sauce better? I have no idea. -Order the pizza, and also try the thin crust. (i'm a fan of thin crust and will try this next time) -Remember that wed night is half off pizza night"}
{"text":"If you want Pizza, wings and beer this is the place to go.   The Pizza is always served hot and tasty. The price is reasonable as well. The staff is generally very attentive to your needs and always friendly.   They have a multitude of TV's that are viewable from just about anywhere in the joint and are always willing to change the channel on a TV near you if you want to watch a different sporting event than the one they have on.   The chicken wings are not as good as they used to be several years ago, but still darn tasty. Years ago they had more of a vinegar based sauce than today, but none the less are nice and tasty. If you want an adventure go with the suicide wings, if you are not as adventurous then go with the mild as they have little if any heat to them, but are fried up and have a wonderful flavor to them.  We have not tried many other things on the menu beyond the pizza, wings and an occasional salad. The few items we have tried are tasty, but not what I would call outstanding. Then again, they are about what you would expect from a place that is known for pizza, wings and beer.   ** Note the \"outdoor seating\" is  a couple of bistro chairs and tables on the sidewalk next to the parking lot and faces west so it is rather hot. I do not recommend the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Beer is good but the pizza was over done.   The staff is attentive and get you anything you want.   Could not even get the Knights hockey game on one TV.   Does not support the local teams.   Fingers were good."}
{"text":"Once again tried to grab lunch with the family. Waited half an hour still no waitress.... This has to be the third time, always seems under staffed... Seen only one waitress that was doing everything.. If you don't mind a 2 hour meal if you can get a refill them you should be fine.... Food is great.... Put me in a bad mood..."}
{"text":"Tried Jonny Mac from reviews on Yelp, nice place,  great local bar and restaurant. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Tried the pizza, it was half off night. Nicely done good taste and quantity of toppings. Good beer selection, will try again if in the area, good family place and nice conversation with some local folks"}
{"text":"My wife and I usually go here on Tuesdays for the half price pizza. Gotta love that pizza, especially when it's half price. Be sure and try the Burgers too, just great. My real love, though, is the suicide wings. I just can't get enough of them. These are not for the faint of heart, these are seriously hot wings. Be sure to wash your hands well before going to the bathroom though."}
{"text":"Every item on the menu taste great. They are famous for chicken wings and they are delicious. Staff is friendly like no where else. If you are coming to LV you have to make a stop to Johnny Mac's"}
{"text":"Hawaiian pizza is amazing!  Great food and atmosphere, make sure and stop by if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"In from OC for a high school baseball weekend. Limited time between games. They fully accommodated over 1/2 our team. Separate checks no problem!! Service awesome. Super friendly!! Would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for over 20yrs and it s still amazing!!  Still remember asking to have y birthday parties her as a kid."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat before our LONG drive home. The first place we went to had a 20 minute wait, so we decided to leave. I checked out the reviews for Johnny macs and it looked SO good.   We got there pretty much when they opened at 11, so there weren't very many other people- it was great. The info on yelp doesn't do this place justice. If we lived here, this would be one of our regular spots. Their fried mushrooms were AMAZING, and their burgers are HUGE. I really wanted to try everything on their menu. They have pizza, sandwiches, wings, pasta- just a little bit of everything! Our server/hostess was wonderful- fast and attentive, I wish I got her name. I highly recommend this place. I already want to go back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Friday late morning.  Our intention was to have a couple bloody Mary's and hit the grocery store. When we walked in the owner was standing at a table in the bar area talking to a group of gentlemen. Nobody was behind the bar. We sat there for 7 minutes, watching employees mill about,  the owner talk to the table. Nobody approached us at all. When we got up to leave the owner was standing by the front counter and said \"see you guys\". Really?  Great customer service.  Needless to say we didn't say \"see ya\" back."}
{"text":"LOVE Johnny Mac's!!! We discovered it maybe a month ago and have been back at least a half a dozen times since then. The wait staff is wonderful. Very friendly and very fast. The food is amazing! I haven't had anything that I haven't liked. Burgers are huge and delicious, chicken tenders are crispy and huge as well. The pizza is the best I've had since I've lived in Nevada."}
{"text":"Great sports pub atmosphere.  My family went on Sunday night and was seated promptly at 7 pm.  Very good service.  Food was decent.  The wings were over done and the watermelon BBQ sauce was unique but didn't quite have a deep flavor profile like I expected.  Overall good experience though."}
{"text":"Delivery service has gone down. It has been sloppy the last few times. Also they never seem to have their famous sauce for the wings. We won't be ordering anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great Place.  Well run, friendly help and great food.  Daily specials are all tasty and worth the treat.  Every night gives a different vibe// good sports sometimes/good music others/great food always.  Try the linguini and bolognes!"}
{"text":"The Pizza is really good here, but the wings are great! They have a bunch of different sauces but they arent necessary the traditional hot is killer. Best in town!"}
{"text":"Best chicken sandwich, antipasto salad, and wings in town! Great place to bring the family because of the non smoking enviornment :-) Absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of my \"regular\" eating spots.  It is a small bar/restaurant that serves some great food.  I have eaten just about everthing on the menu and all have been great. My favorite is the sausage and pasta, but very often Ill have to get the wing/pizza combo with friends.  here is a little hint, they make a thin crust pizza too, i just found this out.  Its my favorite pizza in henderson. Get the wings extra crispy there good too. They always have a good number of staff there always keep your drink full. Also the owner is from Buffalo so the wing sauce is real buffalo sauce."}
{"text":"Holy cow amazing!!!! Awesome onion rings and wings!!! The burger was perfection, Destinee big cups best cups ever!!!!! & amazing customer service"}
{"text":"I have been going to Johnny Mac's since I was a sophmore in high school. ( there might have been dinosaurs  roaming the earth at that time ... but we will act like it is just yesterday.) Back in the day I would go and get two slices of pizza and a coke for lunch. My girlfriends and I would sit and listen to Madonna on the jukebox and chat . At that time Johnny Macs was a very small one room eatery. Since that time it has grown into an actual sports bar with pizza and wings, pasta and many other delicious food items that will keep you coming back for more. Now me? I am a creature of habit. I get the same thing EVERY time ... Not because I am afraid to try new things ... it is just because I am never disappointed with what I order.  So ... last night was half price pizza night... SCORE! Mr. Abbott and I went and shared a pizza and a coke.  The pizza was PERFECT.  The cheese was melty and just the right amount of sauce.  I do mine up with a little parm and peppers...  Honestly it doesn't need anything added. This is the same recipe John has used since he opened the doors.  (I act like I know him ... I don't, but he is always there making sure that his customers are pleased) I watched one gentleman come in and John greeted him and the gentleman jokingly said \"I will have a martini if YOU make it\"  John walked behind the counter and said \"Coming right up\" and made him a martini that the gentleman said was \"To die for\" I will take his word for it.  You have to say something about a local place that keeps the same employees... for YEARS! it makes it feel like you are at cheers... or it is a family business.  We don't get to eat pizza as often as we used to we may splurge like every three months or something ... (stupid healthy eating getting in the way) But when we want pizza we don't go anywhere else.  and If I want wings... I would get them here to. Totally unique and traditional buffalo taste that is perfectly blended.  I can't say enough good things... but honestly... you should try it for yourself :)"}
{"text":"The suicide wings are the best tasting wings I have ever had. As a Fins fan I am proud to say go Buffalo."}
{"text":"Great food. great local place. The service could be better but everyone was friendly.  Had wings and pizza. Couldn't go wrong."}
{"text":"Food was amazing we ordered one order of the wings and if was great!! Too spicy for the little one and we ordered it mild.  Service was slow which was upsetting because it was a nice restraint to eat at. Overall the food was great!"}
{"text":"Awesome wings. Great burgers. Dont know about th he past reviews but the service was spot on.  Good times."}
{"text":"The food here is very good. On food alone, Johnny Macs is an easy 4* maybe 4.5*. I recommend the chicken tenders, but it's all pretty good. The service is pretty awful. Expect to wait a long time for just about anything--being seated, ordering, getting your food, etc. The thing is that the people that are working there are all nice and hard working, but there just aren't enough of them. They need to hire more staff."}
{"text":"Love it! Johnny Macs has the best pizza and chicken strips ever. Our favorite pizza place in the Las Vegas area for sure. :)"}
{"text":"Johnny Mac's has awesome wings. The other food is good, however wings are always a must have. Johnny Macs is one of my favorite places to watch the Knights win games too!"}
{"text":"This could be a 4 star review but I didn't think it deserved overall. We got the Henderson which is a large 1 item pizza and bucket of wings. The pizza is fine honestly just thought it would be more NY style and it's not, they even pre do the dough and it's just not me but is OK. The wings....quality of the wings was great BUY we asked for medium and it was just a awful buttered down hot sauce and didn't even taste like there was anything on them...had Franks red hot at the house and did some soaking. Overall I can just say it was OK and I've heard about this place forever."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill during the past year. I used to go there quite frequently before as the food used to be good. I ordered some take out recently during the middle of the day and was very disappointed with this place. The pizza was overly salty, the crust was hard and tasted very bad. The wings were stringy and had fishy smell. The chicken sandwich was semi-OK, but the sauce was horrible. And the pasta! They put some red colored \"sauce\" which cannot be from a jar as even jar sauce tastes better than that.  The staff was not too friendly either, the middle aged lady at the counter greeted us with a very unfriendly bark.  Very bad experience, and definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Everything was fine but where is my avocado? Just kidding but thx for sending some out. Excellent tasting burger !!! Icey cold beer! Taking one of their Tuesday night specials home.  Order the Henderson special get your picture on the wall if you finish!"}
{"text":"Johnny Mac's is located in a dingy shopping center, and you might miss it if you were just driving through; but don't judge a book by it's cover because I'd consider this place a hidden gem. It's a cute Irish pub with a dark ambiance and some great food. From the pizza to the wings, from the mozzarella sticks to the chicken tenders, this place is bound to have your favorite comfort food. I highly recommend you try this place out. It's definitely a Henderson classic!"}
{"text":"This was my 1st time trying Johnny Macs. Didn't have any expectations but I needed wings on National wing day and I also needed to feed the kids. Checking out the menu I saw The Henderson special. 5 pounds of wings and a large pizza.  Boom! Problem solved.   So thats what we got. 3 different flavors of wings and a pepperoni pizza.   The wings were crispy and good. The hot flavor actually had some spice and good flavor. The wings were a good size too. Not  jumbo or small.   The pizza was also really good.   They make their own blue cheese dressing which normally I am not a fan of but theirs was good and went well with the wings.   I took home enough food for a few more meals.   I'll be back to Johnny Macs very soon.   If you're in the fence give it a try. I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings!  Staff is always really friendly too. Love the new updates. I live in Michigan and I have to come here every time I visit my mom."}
{"text":"Worst pizza place i had for pick up.  Pizza is not warm at all although we got there earlier than promised time of 15 minutes. We ordered sausage only and they put pepperoni and ham. We also want pepper and mushrooms in it but no veggies at all. The tomato sauce is not enough, cant barely taste it.   We didn't realized it was wrong until we get home..   The chicken was overcooked and seems they just poured the sauce in it and wasnt cooked in.   We will never order or dine in here. Ever. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"What's very happy with the service. Sat at a table next to the bar for over 30 minutes and no service. No one ever came up to me about anything. Was pretty upset."}
{"text":"Though the food is good, and we haven't been here for about 2 years, the wait service sucks.  My husband's diet coke was empty  must of the time. And we waited forever for a box to take home our food, I finally got the hostess to get us one. And waiting for the check is ridiculous.  Only come for the food and come with a lot of time."}
{"text":"A great little local's spot with delicious wings and pizza.  There are TVs mounted on every wall, so each seat has a great view if you want to catch a game.  While it is listed primarily as a bar, there is lots of seating and whenever we go it is full of families. Also, the owner is often there and can be seen greeting customers and even serving at times-- adds to the family owned small business charm."}
{"text":"Awesome Buffalo food! When you are looking for that Buffalo flavor- wings, pizza, beef on weck. ... all delicious, just like being back in Buffalo. Since growing up there I am constantly looking for food that matches the flavor and now we have! Johnny Macs is the place. Great atmosphere, friendly staff and delicious food   You have to check it out!"}
{"text":"Pretty ok pizza although a little greasy. The atmosphere is what youd expect, nothing fancy but its a good place to have a drink and a few slices."}
{"text":"well I've been a long time/ loyal patron. Like clockwork every Thursday night after work  we order pizza and wings for delivery. The drivers all know our address (we tip well) always telling us 45 minutes. This Thursday night as usual we order, wait 45 minutes understanding it's now football season after an hour we call. Gal says she can't call delivery guy but it should be delivered soon.  Now it's 1.5 hours later no pizza no call  what good is it if their loyal customers are disregarded because they're to busy due to football. I will never call them again WHAT A SLAP IN THE FACE! BTW after a long day I went to bed hungry. Johnny I hope you read this"}
{"text":"great place...salads were huge and very well done.  ribs were excellent, great texture.....awesome wings and really, really good pizza.  excellent service and very hands on family ownership.  was very glad we came into this place while staying in lake las vegas."}
{"text":"We have never had a bad experience here! We started coming here about 2 months ago and now come at least once a week for (the best) wings! We have also gotten pizza, fried pickles, and mozzarella cheese sticks. Service is fantastic! Laid back atmosphere. You won't be disappointed trying this place!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good atmosphere. Good people. Good service. Good rates. Cold drinks.   .....why would you not want to go to Johnny Mac's?? TRY IT! It's awesome."}
{"text":"Short and to the point... this place was kinda grungy but NOT in that good Seattle way, the food tasted ok but my ribs were cold in the middle, good pricing IF you get what you pay for (that might be a big IF), and the lady behind the bar was nice. I'm probably gonna go back to try the wings because I hear good things about them... we\"ll see..."}
{"text":"Jalapeño green beans with avocado ranch are amazing!!! Pizza is a little on the pricy side but is half off on Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Johnny Mac for years, but, lately we noticed a change in pizza dough. The dough is made ahead of time and stacked.  I love crust and there was none! Please don't change your recipe!!!!"}
{"text":"Our party of four picked a new place for our monthly lunch experience. Johnny Mac's centrally located in a strip mall on Boulder Hywy. I had read the reviews and felt this was a sure shot and would please everyone. Wrong. Entering we were greeted enthusiastically by servers and bartender alike. Let me state upfront...the service could not have been better. Absolutely the best. The place was clean and pleasant with some gaming and the ususal gaggle of TV's. Seating ( beside the bar) is a combination of tall tables and booths. Promptly seated in the booth of our choice and were told of the daily specials and given menu's,very extensive.  We ordered a medium cheese pizza with olives and pepperoni,  a salad with grilled chicken, 1lb of chcken wings with a small Caesar salad and a BBQ/Bacon hamburger. The pizza and mild wings were very good and the  chicken on the salad was tasty. The burger was way overcooked/dry and the greens on all the salads (all four) were mushy and appeared to have been frozen at one time. The croutons were soft. Our suggestion: pizza and wings. I know we should have said something to the server but after driving over from Summerlin we were very hungry at that point."}
{"text":"CHILD PLEASE! I'm from Chicago and I know pizza so I say this without pause. This pizza is a glorified little ceasars or pizzahut . Otherwise this is just a normal joint in the hood. Nothing special as far as pizza is concerned. I was critical of the pizza because it was supossed to be this great place for pizza , but its not!"}
{"text":"If you want to eat the best wings in town while having a beer/cider and enjoying either a sporting event or classic rock music in the background, this is your place! Buffalo Wild Wings and Wing Nutz have nothing on this place - honestly.  We were in search of a wing place that offered a variety of sauces, had a great atmosphere, was reasonably priced, and offered excellent customer service. Well we finally found the place. It is a little drive from where we live, but definitely well worth it.   The garlic cilantro and watermelon BBQ were my favorite wing sauce choices. I had an Angry Orchard cider and enjoyed the classic rock music and good company while he enjoyed his lemon pepper and suicide wings, pizza, and a cold bottled beer while watching the races on one of the many television sets near our booth. The wings are just how we like them - crisp, meaty, and flavorful.   Although we didn't go to Johnny Mac's intending to eat a pizza, our server made us aware of the numerous specials they have. Some are on specific days and some are grouped with certain orders. For example, we had ordered 5lbs of wings. So, he informed us about the Henderson Special that groups a large one-item pizza with 5lbs of wings for what amounted to about $7.00 more. We have no problem with leftovers with two teenage boys and thought for that price - why not! The pizza was also very good!  One of the things I personally enjoy about going out to eat is the adventure in meeting new people and having some friendly conversation with our good food. While there, a nearby employee hearing us question whether or not the restaurant used to be a car shop because of it's two garage-like doors near the entrance, came over and made light conversation with us. He told us that the restaurant opens those doors on nice days, but that there was a history behind the doors as it was not the original design. He showed us a picture on his phone of a car that drove right through the front of the building two years ago. He said after that, the owners took the insurance money and instead of rebuilding the wall, installed glass windows that open like a garage door. I looked at his phone and laughed as I saw this car literally sticking out of Johnny Mac's and told him that this conversation piece should certainly be framed and put on the wall - just a thought!   Anyway - we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been in here several times pre Yelp to have a couple of cocktails or grab a bit to eat.  It has always been a sandwich or burger.  I had yet to try their famous wings or pizza.  The other day I went and had lunch.  I automatically spotted the sliced pizza rotating in it's display.  I thought that would be the way to go.  When I was sat at my table, I was advised by the server that the special was meatloaf.  I love meatloaf and did not want to pass that up or the pizza slice for that matter so I ordered both.  The pizza is in fact some of the best bar pizza I have ever had.  I sure it's stock would improve dramatically after a good night of boozing.  The meatloaf arrived and I was taken back by the shear size of slab that lay before me.   It arrived with a mountain of mashed potatoes and brown gravy with wonderful looking mushrooms thrown in.  There was also a nice caesar salad that came with the meal.  I took my time and watched those that were drinking at the bar on a Monday afternoon.  Everyone seemed very happy and knew each other. The staff seemed really focused on all those that they knew.  As for me not being a familiar face, I got the tourist treatment.  I doubt that I will ever become a bar fly at Johnny Mac's.  I can totally deal with that.  I am pretty sure that when ever I am jonesing for a slice of that pizza, I will probably make my way there again."}
{"text":"By far my favorite pizza!! I don't know I went so long without knowing of this place! I don't even live in Henderson and I have it once a week. They have a great menu, I love the vibe inside and everyone is always great with service weather it's Tuesday evening or Friday! I was just in for St. Patrick's day and it was insanity (in a good way ) and still didn't mind waiting, it was a great time. I usually get it Togo and girl that checks me out is always sweet and patient. Johnny Macs is my #1"}
{"text":"The server, Erica, is awesome and made my birthday dinner so special!! Every time I go there, I request for her table and receive excellent service every time!"}
{"text":"I've been eating chicken tenders here for over 20 years.   Wow, did I just say that?  In those 20 years they have maintained themselves as the gold standard of chicken tenders. The sauces are awesome. The chicken is well cooked. The breading is properly applied and of a good thickness. There are never any of those fried breading balls covered in sauce with no chicken inside. The ranch dressing is great.   Here's the best part: the bleu cheese dressing is amazing. They make it in-house, I'm told, and it is the best bleu cheese dressing I've ever had. Not only that, but one of the only ones I can stand. I hate bleu cheese. I take a perverse pleasure in convincing others that hate bleu cheese to try it. I've never had a person dislike it!   I live 40 minutes away from this place but it is only 5 minutes from my parents' house and as a kid I used to work at the Smith's with which it shares a parking lot. It's nice to see a place stand up to the test of time. It's always sad to have a place you loved as a kid be revealed as low-rent dumpster food you liked because you didn't know any better. Johnny Mac's is the opposite: food that has always been truly good and hopefully will continue to be until I'm too old to taste it anyway."}
{"text":"Always great food and service. The wings are the best in town. They do a great burger and roast beef on wreck. Never disappointed. I've been going there for 4years. Most my local friends have been going there since they opened on the regular."}
{"text":"Whenever a discussion about the best chicken wings comes up on Yelp Talk, Johnny Mac's is always an honorable mention- which is what put them on my radar. But I came in with a friend on Wednesday, their half price pizza night, and didn't have room for them. But I definitely want to come back, if only for the novelty of watermelon BBQ sauce!  As I said, pizzas are half price on Wednesdays (dine-in only), and they have other daily specials like BOGO pastas (Thursdays) each day of the week. We went for an early dinner around 4PM and by 5PM there was a standing room only wait- this spot is popular! Despite the crowd, servers came by consistently, were friendly, and did not rush us out, which was much appreciated.  Food was solid- we started with an app order of Cowboy Bites, fried balls of corn, cheese, jalapeno, and olive, with a southwest dipping sauce. They were tasty but I would probably try something else in the future. For our pizza, we decided on the California White (EVOO, tomato, basil, garlic, ricotta, artichokes, roasted peppers, and mozz)- even the small was huge and more than enough for the two of us to share. Pizza was super cheesy with lots of veggies, which was appreciated. Despite all the toppings, I felt something was missing, and added a bit of the app dipping sauce to my pie for a bit more zing. I'd come back to try another pie or those wings though!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times, and gotten something different each time. I really wanted to like this place, but the prices are too high and the food is simply not good. I even got food poisoning from the lasagna once."}
{"text":"I had really high hope for this place.  Walked in around 2pm.  We thought it would be the perfect time to try this place when it's not too busy.  Standing there...  standing there.  We had to wait about 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge we were there and tell us just to sit wherever.  Hmm.  Ok.   Luckily the bartender/waitress came over right away and got our drink order.  We decided to split some wings since many of the yelpers loved them.  Now I don't know if it was an off day for them, but our wings were way over done. They seemed dry and tough.  Bummer man. I had really high hopes for them since my husband loves wings.  Saving grace was my turkey, bacon and avocado sandwich.  It was huge!  The meat was stacked so high that I couldn't open my mouth wide enough to take a bite.  They accompanied the sandwich with so many fries that I couldn't finish them all.  This portion of my visit was fantastic.  Other than my sandwich, the rest (service and wings) was just ok.  I'm always one to give places a second chance.  Maybe our next visit will be better."}
{"text":"Always great food and service! The food is always wonderful. They can accommodate a party of 2 or large family. I love the remodel."}
{"text":"You can not beat the wings. It is that simple. The chicken strips are yummy too. If you are lucky to live close enough, they will even deliver it. But the delivery hours are kind of weird so make sure you call and ask before you make it your plan."}
{"text":"Wish everyday was fish fry Friday!! That's when they make the Beer Battered Cod here. Flaky, light and fresh. Plus points for having Heinz Malt Vinegar for the condiment!  Wish everyday was Beef Weck Saturday!! That's the only time they make Beef on a Weck here! It's Mr.B's favorite. Quality roast beef, thinly sliced, plied on a kummelweck roll. (yes they offer it on Friday too...shhh)   Oh wish it was St Patricks Day everyday too! They dish out some awesome Irish dishes! The only time you can get  their delicious Corned Beef and Cabbage..  All meat for burgers, sandwiches, even chicken if I'm not mistaken is all fresh, not frozen.  So what else is good to order on the rest of the days?  The BBQ SPARERIBS slathered in the bbq watermelon sauce. Ribs are slow baked and only a few of them each day so once it's gone it's gone!   Broasting method used to make chicken wings! Says so on the menu too. The broasted method has less grease, results in plump, juicer chicken. I like both garlic parmesan and watermelon. People order these by the 5lb buckets though lately. What the heck!   Also what the heck... Wednesdays this place is craaaaazy busy! Pizza day! Not sure what the promo is since I don't order pizza ...half off?..but my friends and family are willing to wait 30 minutes for a table to free up.   Which leads me to mention that I've been holding off on this review for selfish reasons. #SorryNotSorry..lol...place has enough rave Yelp reviews and you guys are taking up my table! But congrats on getting People Love Us on Yelp..very cool JMac!  The place to watch a football, baseball, basketball game if you ask me.  Large TV screens everywhere so wherever you sit, you have a good view. Mr. B calls it the perfect Irishman's man cave! Complete with beer,sports memorabilia and taxidermy animal heads on the wood paneled walls.   The restaurant sits  in the Smiths shopping center Friendly Donut House is a few doors down.  On nice days when there is no wind the doors slide out and we have fresh air and a lovely view of the parking lot.     Ive never had any problems with service in the 20+ times Ive been here. Even on the super busy nights, the JMac crew work as a team.  Youve got the host/hostess that seats you. Another person who takes your drink order and makes the rounds refilling your drinks, Your main server, another employee who makes the rounds to each table to see how everything is....sometimes John JMac himself is in the house and will come by to see how you are doing. Everyone is friendly and super tolerant of some of their senile elderly customers that are demanding.   The vibe here is cool and has a locals feel to it. I don't mind sitting in the bar area here. Everyone is pretty chill and the bartenders are on top of things. Love that it's NON SMOKING and dining area is family friendly. It's no wonder why it's been around now for 31 years!"}
{"text":"It was a rainy November Vegas night. Accidentally tried this place about a year ago when I needed to take my girlfriend out for a pizza night, little did I know I was about to find the Holy Grail of chicken wangz. We both agreed after our first pound of crack that Johnny Macs was our go to place for wings and anywhere else would be a betrayal. We've even gave a few places around town a shot like 702 Wings, and VooDoo wings. Not even remotely the same. Do yourself a favor and come here, especially when a VGK game is on and you can get a nice cold $3 Draft with your crack. I mean wings!"}
{"text":"Went here for our 5th time last week and took a friend who has never been.   We were dicing but all of us got away with having to try drinks which was good.  I was so looking forward to the ravioli with the tomato sauce and was a bit disappointed when it came out, perhaps they changed the recipe but it used to have a spicy kick to it and now it was just tomato sauce but thats alright.  The food and service was amazing!  And its been remodeled and we loved that except the bathroom used to be private and now its public--Meaning it used to be one room with a locking door and now its not, I dont like that at all but hey, Im a weirdo.    :)  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awful.  I was initially attracted by the picture outside that had a rack of mouth-watering ribs (which, by the way, looks nothing like the actual product).  I'm so glad I only ordered the half rack, because I found the \"watermelon\" BBQ sauce nauseating.  It lacks any sort of intensity or flavor, so it was almost like I was eating the ribs naked, which essentially tastes like bland pork.  However, I did see the people next to me eating wings and they looked a helluva lot better than what I ordered, so maybe I might go back and try something else.  But not soon, because I inadvertently under-tipped my waiter by miscalculating the total cost (I had only brought cash).  Oh well."}
{"text":"Was at Johnny Mac's again last week. and as always the service was great and the food was excellent .  I live out of town and every time I'm in town I make a effort to go there because the food is excellent.  Looking forward to my next visit in a few months."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall.  Always very friendly service and easily the best wings in town.  Great value and had the pizza a few times which is also good - but come for some cold beer, good service and great wings!"}
{"text":"This place used to be great but after the remodel the service went down as did the quality of the food.  Last night I was in there with some friends from out of state and we got 2 of the Henderson Specials with 2 watermelon BBQ, 1 medium hot wings and 1 honey BBQ wings.  The wings came dry with a pile of thick jelly type sauce poured in the middle on only a couple wings out of the of wings in each baskets.  That's 4 baskets of wings un-tossed.  I asked them to please toss one order of watermelon BBQ wings with the sauce and they brought them back and said they just made me a new batch but the new batch didn't have any sauce at all.  The server didn't feel like refilling our drinks (we weren't asking for excessive refills,this was after the first time asking for a refill and waiting 15 minutes to get 1 pitcher of water tossed on the table for 9 people to share).  He filled my husbands cup and dumped water all over his lap and then left us a pitcher and said we could refill them ourselves.  We were a little embarrassed as we had told our out of town guest about how great this place was.  This is the second time in a row I've had poor service and had to return my food to the kitchen, last time they served my 4 year old hot wings on accident instead of watermelon BBQ wings that I had ordered for her."}
{"text":"We just moved from the east Vegas area to Henderson, so we're on the lookout for our local place to go for pizza and chicken fingers. This place was not the winner. We were told a 20 minute wait and it was actually 45 minutes. They were on a 2 hour wait for to-go orders so we were thinking this would be spectacular. Buuuut... no. $15 for a 12 inch cheese pizza?! Wowzers! It was completely over baked, the cheese was dark brown. Working in customer service management myself, I'm surprised it was able to leave the kitchen. They made a new one which was nice!, but actually wish we just asked for it off the bill. The new one was cooked better, just still not a fan. $12 for 5 chicken finger and no fries? $15 for over cooked fish and chips? The good things were: the onion rings, my husband liked his beef sandwich ($15 I believe, should have kept my receipt), and the kids meals were a good price and value. Overall, $90 for (overcooked) bar food? Meh. We left saying \"well we tried it, but don't need to come back.\"  P.S. To the people that do go, please don't take up the few large tables they have for 3 hours. The servers miss out on money from it as well as it being an inconvenience for those waiting."}
{"text":"Westin Employee referred us to Johnny Mac's. The best service. Not only by our waitress Katie, but all other floor employees walked by asking if we were ok. Food was good, pizza was very filling. I'll definitely come back if I'm on vacation in the area again."}
{"text":"Johnny Mac's is a great local pub with some of the best food in town. The Big Vin is my favorite sandwich and I sometimes eat here 4 or 5 times a month, it's that good. The chicken wings are also some of the best you'll ever find and if you're in a daring mood try the Suicide flavor. It'll melt your tastebuds off your tongue."}
{"text":"I was expecting something way better after reading all the reviews.  The pizza was bland and nothing special as was the beef on weck sandwich.  Nothing at all made this place stand out... im going to just stick to going to Bistro Pizza in henderson off Gibson.... food is WAY better"}
{"text":"Very dive-y looking in the front. We decided to try it out a few months ago when I was pregnant. Wasn't terribly impressed. We ordered a meat plate/sampler, that just had the meat and cheese thrown on there. When our pizza finally came, there was a pool of grease sitting on top of it. I've had it better frozen, out of a box.  For whatever reason, we decided to give them a second chance, with delivery, about a month later.  There was a mile long black hair baked into our pizza. NO thanks, never again."}
{"text":"Always busy, but great service. Wings are yummy. We order takeout frequently and they never get our order wrong!"}
{"text":"Accidentally ran across Johnny Mac's and glad we decided to stop by! Quick and friendly service! Got the meat lovers pizza and Johnny mac classic burger and of course enjoyed a few adult beverages... no complaints all around!! Thank you and look forward to coming again soon!!"}
{"text":"This establishment is good for a big party because they take reservations.  As for the food, I have mixed reviews.  The restaurant claimed to serve New York style pizza.  Unfortunately, the pizza did not taste like a NY pizza.  The crust was soggy and there was too much sauce on the pizza.  However, their chicken wings were excellent.  The BBQ ribs were also very tasty.  Overall, I would return for the ribs  and chicken wings."}
{"text":"The food is good but the bartenders are mostly garbage. They don't know what their own specials are. I called Saturday morning specifically asking if they had Cox Cable and PAC12 network (dish and direct don't have PAC12) because I was planning to watch the Oregon ducks football game there. Guy on phone assured me they had the channel and will show the game. Upon arrival, no Cox Cable, no PAC12, no ducks game. Pissed me off somethin fierce. Still passed about it."}
{"text":"Two words Henderson Special. It has wings, pizza and salad for a very reasonable price. The wings are crisp and juicy, the sauce perfectly seasoned. The pizza is greasy and flimsy. The salad crisp and fresh. This is my favorite place for date night. I wish they delivered, but every time I call the driver isn't working :-( Service is slow, but who cares, give me my wings and leave me alone. It's as close to perfection as any sports bar will ever get in my life."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would!!! Waited over an hour for a table for my aunt to celebrate her birthday. The owner just gave away our table for his own personal friends! Horrible business tactics. Been coming here for years and I promise that myself and the other 13 individuals I was with will NEVER return!"}
{"text":"we loved this place! had to grab dinner that night and found some great deals on food and drinks. they know how to make a whiskey ginger!  I'd only say the fish n chips need a looking at, good but maybe the oil temperature was off?  I'd get it again to compare for sure though!"}
{"text":"This is always one of my favorite places to eat. Always such good service, food and drinks. Every time I have someone visit from out of town I bring them here because it's so close to my house. LOVE this place! I definitely recommend if you're looking for a new local spot."}
{"text":"A happening place. This is a family run restaurant/bar/pub with excellent food. When we first went to see this restaurant 5 years ago, we were disappointed as it was in a strip mall and looked like a biker bar. We gave it a chance a few months later and have never been disappointed. It is our favorite restaurant in Henderson with five star food. We have never been disappointed in the food. The servers are very friendly and attentive. This is a local bar and has it's regulars but everyone is given wonderful service. Very much a sports bar with the owner coming to Las Vegas years ago from Buffalo~~"}
{"text":"Good food and service - only complaint was the lighting was a little too dark"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5 stars for the wings and boneless strips.  They are awesome!!!  I usually order them with the SUICIDE sauce which is VERY HOT, but has a lot of flavor as well.  Ive been going to this place for about the last 20 years or longer.  I do think the pizza is a little expensive, but it is also very good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for lunch. I had a grilled chicken sandwich with a side salad and the wife had the lunch special 2 slices of pizza and a soda. She raved the pizza and said it was a top 5 pizza she has ever had. My chicken sandwich was good, but I traditionally order safe cleaner food. It was about as good as a chicken sandwich could be! Toasted bun made it much better than if it was just a plain jane bun. Service was awesome. Both gentlemen were friendly, accommodating, and helpful! Would definitely come back if I were to stay in the Henderson area again."}
{"text":"I went to Johnny Macs on Sunday and here are my thoughts.  The food was perfect for a bar type of venue.  I had the Roast Beef on Weck, (a roast beef sandwich on a salty kaiser roll....it's a Buffalo thing), and it was fantastic.  The buffalo wings were great.  They had the right crispy texture on the outside with the meat nice and tender underneath.  The place is a \"dive bar\" but is very far from being a dive.  If I didn't live on the other side of town I'd be there all the time.  Regardless, I plan on going back any opportunity I get."}
{"text":"Probably the 3rd or 4th time I've been to Johnny Mac's now and they're just as awesome as ever.   Their white pizza is great. No boring Alfredo sauce here.  I've also ordered a regular pizza with jalapeño and pineapple. Their 6\" is the perfect size for one person. Nice crust, on the thin side but not so thin it's hard as a rock.   Their homemade garlic bread is one of my favorites. Packed with garlic, topped with a tomato slice and the perfect amount of melty cheese. It's served with a side of marinara which my girlfriend goes without because of the onions. Otherwise no complaints.   Most recently I ordered the pasta primavera. It normally comes with Alfredo sauce but I only like white sauce on my pizza so I opted for marinara instead. It. Was. FANTASTIC. Garlic, tomatoes, artichokes, broccoli. The portion size was huge and it came with garlic bread.   While I was devouring my pasta deliciousness, my girlfriend was enjoying the chicken club panini. Simple but wonderfully done, only comment would be the honey mustard sauce on it. Normally honey mustard has kind of a tang to it and while some of it was, some of the mustard tasted more dull and creamy. Maybe like they used the mayonnaise knife to spread it or something.  All that said, johnny macs continues to impress and satisfy."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had!! Took my husband there and he said the same thing. Waitress was nice and quick. It was a busy Thursday and all of the staff seemed to be working hard. We didn't wait very long for a table."}
{"text":"Great place, I searched for best chicken wings in Henderson and this popped up.  Read the reviews and thought we'd give it a try.  Wow on the way out a young lady called Lou was super friendly and told us how to get the chicken wings next time:  \"Double Bake\"  Apparently the chefs will know what it means.  They dip them in hot sauce (which is very hot by the way, we had it with our pizza (yes we meant to have only wings but it was half off pizza night)  So apparently, the \"double bake\" is wings in hot sauce that get run through the pizza oven.  Also, the wings we had tonight were \"Mild\" and \"extra crispy.\"  A great combination, although not as saucy as you would expect, the balance of flavors was superb.  Will eat again."}
{"text":"Back in 2006ish - 2007, this place really was a hit. Now if you enjoy running to the bathroom before your last bite, head on in and grab yourself some diarrhea food. Guarantee you'll have the worst gas of your life."}
{"text":"This is a really nice neighborhood bar and restaurant.  It is a great place to watch the game.  It's also a great place to bring the family for pizza and wings.  The staff is really friendly and very accommodating.    I like everything on the menu.  The wings are their specialty, but the pizza is really good too.  Last time I was there was with a large group of friends.  We were able to feed 12 people for $150 including drinks and gratuity.  We all left full and had food left over.  You can't beat a value like that."}
{"text":"I am selecting zero stars.  I certainly hope these guys sell a lot of beer, because they are not interested in selling pizza or wings.  Walked it to do a take out order, that seemed to be a pain to the girl waiting on me, she promptly told me that all the specials on the board were no good for take out orders.  (This is advertised as a take-out place) Then she said we have a pizza/wing special for 39.00.  This doesn't sound like a special to me, Im sorry.  Then I actually tried to order a 12 inch pizza which they obviously weren't interested in selling because it went from $12.00 to $18.00 because of a boxing charge for take out orders.  At that point I left, I wasn't going to wait thirty minutes to get charged a boxing charge for a pizza."}
{"text":"Been eating at johnny mac's for as long as I can remember!! This place is a henderson land mark. Great food, friendly people, cant go wrong with ANYTHING on the menu, the wings are the best around, and the pizza is always great."}
{"text":"Wings are OK, but expensive for what you get. Service is very poor if they are busy. Had our waiter walk by and ask if everything was OK. He didn't even stop for me to answer. I had to flag down a bus boy to finally get a refill."}
{"text":"BOY OH BOY! Not sure where to even start... i ordered bbq wings and the California  burger. Hands down best wings i have ever tried! The wings are very saucy just the way i like them! Ive been to so many wing places and none have ever tasted like this. If you like saucy you will Love this. Finished all the wings..... still wanting more. No wonder they were voted the best wings in Vegas! This restaurant looks like a little hole in the wall on the outside but is actually a great hangout sports bar. Everything is super casual and we had great service from the moment we were greeted till the moment we walked out the door.  All the Locals love this place & i know people who drive from across town just for the wings and cheese pizza, I dont blame them! This place is great for families or just a night out."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding. Not much draft beer selection and the machines at the bar are very stingy. Best antipasto salad and hot wings in town."}
{"text":"Overall we enjoyed our visit.  The soda drinks are served in HUGE containers which was entertaining when they first arrived.  The wings we ordered were disappointing in that they were dry and thin on meat - the staff graciously offered to replace them but we decided to skip it and they instead removed them from our bill - greatly appreciated!  The pizza we ordered, the Johnny Mac special with mushrooms added was very generous on toppings.  I'd prefer my crust a little thinner than the pizza we were served but overall it was an enjoyable pie!"}
{"text":"Tried to go to this place with the wife and another couple on St. Patrick's Day. Yeah, that was a bad idea. The place was jammed packed! We got there around 5pm and were told about an hour wait. We waited about 45 minutes and asked and found out we were still 15 parties down the list so decided to go elsewhere.   I was so intrigued to try the place based on recommendation of a couple guys I know that have lived in Vegas for 15+ years so I went back AGAIN a day later by myself. I walked in and grabbed an immediate seat at the bar, no wait.   I went with 2lbs of buffalo wings, hot, with fries. The bartender was nice enough to give me the bar special which made it probably $8 cheaper so I really appreciate her for that. I asked and she recommended I try the secret baked wings and I did.   I am a huge wing lover and these were without a doubt. The best wings I've had in town. I am glad I live in Henderson and can easily make my way back here to dine again.   For a place that doesn't look like much from the outside, or inside for that matter, I was really impressed with the bathroom. It was clean and updated. So extra kudos for that.   Highly recommend you give this place a shot too!"}
{"text":"Been to Johnny Mac's a few times, had the ribs smothered with the watermelon BBQ sauce.  Very very good!!  I also tried a few of their burgers and they were kick ass!  Very messy but very very good.  My girlfriend is hooked on the teriyaki chicken fingers.  The service has been fantastic every time we visited this place.  The best time to go is during happy hour, better deal on drinks!"}
{"text":"A Henderson staple!  I did not like this place in high school.  I thought it was too dark and the food was not up to par with other places around town.  Fast forward almost 10 years and we frequent here because my friends grew up on it and they have half off pizzas on Wednesdays!  They just renovated the entire restaurant and it looks real nice although the tables by the bar are wayyy too small and kind of in the way of people trying to sit at the bar.  It's very hard to eat pizza here with two people.    I know a lot of people who say this is the best pizza in town and I immediately have to argue with them.  This pizza isn't bad by any standards and I think has improved since I was in high school but it is nowhere near the best.  Johnny Mac's is a Henderson staple where the big whigs from city hall and the regular joes come and break bread together.  I love this aspect of it!  Everybody has their own reason to like it and I think this is what differentiates it from other local spots like PT's."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great wings, great people. A bit far from town but a great local spot. We shall return!"}
{"text":"First pizza came out burnt on the bottom and gooey dough under all the toppings ... sorry don't eat raw dough so .. sent back the waiter saw it and understood.. made us another one but by the time it came out we got it to go ... got back to the condo and another raw dough pizza ... after I baked it in the oven for 10 mins it was very good !"}
{"text":"Customer service!!! They got it. I was amazed how attentive, direct, the follow-up and this was for a to go order. Great job you guys put a smile on my face and I have even gotten to the food which looks great"}
{"text":"This one is for you Jer.... Mr. Mac I hear migrated from the mother land of wings(buffalo). Now I like pizza, I have been a long time conasaur of wings. I have sampled a good 100 or so wings from the Anchor Bar. The establishment that claims started this delicacy. Johnny could use bat wings battered and dipped in his wingy sauce and I would still think they are taste o' licious. Some sauces are meant to be sopped up with your left over pizza crust and Mac's is on that list. I travel a good 30miles round trip to partake on his wingy dingies. Make sure you ask for extra sauce on your babies because the secret is in the sauce when it comes to wings. The meat is meaty also, you rarely ever get that bastard stepchild of a wing all small over crisp and retarded. Mac's is on my list when I think of purchasing wings for myself or chowing down with the guys. Shalom Johnny Macs."}
{"text":"As a Buffalo native, I was excited to find this place while visiting the area.  I was disappointed that I didn't see some of my Western NY favorites (Vernor's ginger ale, loganberry and haddock fish fry) but was very happy with the pizza we ordered.  (Although I would have liked the classic Buffalo-style rectangular cut.). We got the cheese pizza and it was delicious.  There was a 1/2 off pizza deal that made lunch there even more appealing.  Service was a little lacking but the good food and great price made up for it in my eyes."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's a whole in the wall bar in a strip mall. Our friends happened upon it through their business and highly recommended it. We've been here twice (3 if you count the time we had them deliver pizza to the house) and have not been disappointed. The prices are reasonable, the food is excellent and so is the service. Plus, it's not too far from our house. We'll definitely be back regularly."}
{"text":"These reviews made me think this place was good. What a disappointment. Maybe it's good when you're drunk and can't taste the food. Highly over-rated. 35 dollars for wings and tenders that were not even mediocre. They at least were kind enough to refund me the money."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great atmosphere and really good food. Try the deep fried pickles. They are hard to find in Vegas and this place makes them great."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch got the spinach salad special, wow one of best salad   I've had. Normally I get a sandwich or pasta. As always Gemma gives great service at bar, very friendly staff."}
{"text":"What a great atmosphere it is in Johnny Mac's.  It has that feel of a local's place where everyone knows your name.  The food was superb and the service was stellar.  I can't wait to go back, I highly recommend this place.  Try the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from some friends who live in Boulder City.  When I pulled up I was a little apprehensive because it isn't the best looking area.  The place is nice inside though.  The atmosphere is great and the staff is very nice.  They are known for their wings and pizza, and for good reason. I love the wings!  The pasta is good also and they have different specials every day.  I go here all the time now."}
{"text":"Been going there for many years now, hands down the best wings in town. Love their watermelon wings and the pizza is great as well."}
{"text":"Sooooo Delicious! Tried the roast beef on Wek, twas the Monday special. I loved it! Horseradish and a Pickle on the side...with  Au Jus.  Good Pizza also, I will go back when I'm in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"The meatball sub is bomb and huge, I've had so many where the meatballs were dry this one was juicy."}
{"text":"We stopped in while on Vacation from CA and I cannot express how happy we were. From the outside you don't know what to expect. When you walk in you are welcomed with smiles and pure hospitality. The cups are HUGE so refills probably don't happen often however someone offered to top us off!!! What!?!?! It was beyond nice. We had mozzarella sticks and pizza and it was amazing. Great food, ballgames on TV, fun music, and wonderful people. I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This was the second time we have been here and the experience was like night and day. Our server was not very good, we ordered appetizers that never showed up, everyones food showed up but my sister in laws, she got her food about 10 minutes later. Then when our bill showed up we were charged for extra beer and there were charges then charges taken away, we were confused. We will go back again!  The wings, pizza and fish fry were good!!!!!!! Beers were cold!!!! It's a busy place........."}
{"text":"Our hostess Christine was courteous and double checked with chef if the items we ordered were vegetarian. We tried the pasta primavera and the alfredo fettuccine for kids. It was tasty nonetheless. The garlic bread was really good, we loved it. Great service as well."}
{"text":"So happy I FINALLY talked my boyfriend into going here. I used to grub here at least once a week when I worked up at the lake. Bar food yes, but way more than that. Sandwiches and fresh pastas. Daily specials that you can almost never go wrong with. I've had a meatloaf sandwich as a special, chicken Marsala and omg the egg fettuccine noodles were so yummy. Fish fry Fridays.  Good service, not AMAZING but it seems like a family style spot with a decent crew. Not a chain joint, and did I mention they have watermelon wings?  Minors are allowed in the restaurant area, I've yet to check out the bar but the bartenders were all young and attractive. Seems like it would be a cool place to watch a game, unless your going against the team playing the Bills, cuz this is def a buffalo bar!"}
{"text":"A local favorite. Though it does get busy, we have never had to wait longer than a few minutes. Service has always been fast and friendly. Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is that of a small locals favorite spot, and that's exactly what it is. We always seems to stick with what we know is delicious here- wings, fries, onion rings and pizza."}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall place in the Smith's shopping center, I stumbled on this place shortly after moving back to the area and was staying at mom's up the street....really needed a break!  Found this place with COLD beer and great food.    The lasagna is very good, as is the meatball sandwich- their fries are crispy and fresh.    Have had the Panini and that was also tasty.    It gets really busy here during sporting events and on the weekend, normally I haven't waited very long but it does get very crowded and can be a bit noisy.   The parking can get a bit hairy but its fairly close no matter where you have to park.    All in all, I really like this place, good drink and good food.  I'll go back!!"}
{"text":"This place is great place to go on a date or with the family. Affordable prices, lots of options and excellent service. Very highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a real find! The food was very tasty & reasonable, the wait staff friendly. Lots of people there but it wasn't noisy. Great atmosphere. Wish we had one in NLV!"}
{"text":"I can't keep my mind off of pizza today for some reason, and thinking about Johnny Mac's isn't helping any.  This pizzeria's been around in Henderson for literally as long as I can remember, and it's devotees are strong in both number and ferocity.  Now, the pizza here is good, don't get me wrong.  It's an authentic, made-just-for-you, pie of yuminess.  However, the pizza isn't what gets people about this place, it's the pizza's accompaniment:  the wings.  Johnny Mac hails from Buffalo and brought his special secret recipe with him when he migrated here.  Many people claim these wings are the best in the valley and I would have to agree with them."}
{"text":"Best service. Best wings. We come back here time and again. My kids request this place for pizza and wings when we ask them where they want to go. Every time we come back the service gets better and better. This place is a hidden gem and will not disappoint. Great atmosphere for the adults too!"}
{"text":"Awesome hole in the whole! Totally deceiving and rewarding! Food and menu is excellent! Service is solid, and staff is fantastic! Greeted at the door by multiple staff members! Highly recommend! Perfect for lunch, but can't wait to try some past or pizza for dinner!"}
{"text":"Guess I struck out, yet again. I was really hankering for some of that watermelon bbq sauce I heard so much about. Last weekend I was in the area and decided to try some watermelon BBQ sauce wings. They charged me almost 12$ for a pound of wings which i thought was a little steep , but i thought they better be worth it. I waited 5 mins or so to even have someone help me. One of the servers was having it out with the cook , some F bombs were dropped I thought geeze save it for montel, don't leave the dirty laundry out when there's patrons at the counter. Finally some lady said oh are you waiting to order food? I thought No i just like to stare blankly at menu boards, because I don't have cable. I Placed my order waited 10 mins or so for the wings and go them to go. Arrived at my destination to enjoy some high dollar wings and was sadly disappointing. The watermelon BBQ sauce was not very tangy and rather bland. I have had better elsewhere, perhaps there main dishes are more appealing. For the price I wasn't too pleased."}
{"text":"Came with a friend a couple days ago to watch the game not really expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised.   At the beginning of the game, there was a couple of open seats at the bar, but by the end of the game the place was more or less full and everyone was having a great time. We ordered typical bar food, pizza and some wings, which was great and even though the bartender was swamped she never totally forgot about us which was also nice.   All in all it was a typical local's bar with good food.  I wouldn't hesitate coming in for another game."}
{"text":"Came for the highly touted BBQ watermelon sauce but really enjoyed the pizza.  Even though we live about 40 minutes away this is going to become a monthly visit for the wife and I."}
{"text":"I love this place first off cause there is no smoking inside. I'm not a fan of my meal being ruined by someone's cigarette smoke blowing in my face. Speaking of meals, the food is delicious. Well I've only tried the pizza and the wings. My name is Jacob and I'm addicted to the twice baked hot wings! No dipping sauce needed, ranch and blue cheese only get in the way. Nicole, Christine, and I believe it's Lou perhaps Luke have excellent customer service skills. The ambience is excellent as well, with all the TVs there isn't a bad spot to catch the game. Thanks Johnny Mac's for representing Henderson the right way!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best hot wings in town. I have tried wings at several places around the valley and Johnny Mac's double baked hot wings are the best. The crispy outside and the tender meat inside complements the NY style pizza's very well. I often do the Henderson and Small Henderson specials as my go-to."}
{"text":"$12 for a tiny Beef on Weck sandwich and fries... $11 for a pound of wings (that's about 7 wings)...$18.25 for a large cheese and pepperoni pizza... Overpriced bar food to say the least."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was in High School. Always ordering \"THE BIG VIN\". My all time favorite... but they recently changed the buns to these thick buns which make it taste like all bread and really dry:(  I mean each bun must be over and inch thick I could barely get my mouth  around it please go back to the old buns ! I could always count on that sandwich to deliver .."}
{"text":"If you like wings, you'll love theirs.  Had the scorching wings double baked (baked, then fried I think)...all I know is they come out crispy and delicious.  Great flavor, good heat.   The fries however, need some help - over cooked, no salt, tasteless...but will be back for more wings."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Henderson, Nevada for work, I stopped by this restaurant at the suggestion of several locals.  The restaurant was started by a former New Yorker, and the walls have a few autographed New York Yankee jerseys on them. The wait staff was super friendly and very accommodating.  I ordered the Pink Vodka Raviolis.  It was just enough for lunch, light, and very flavorful.    Definitely a place worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place knows how to make a pizza. Perfect amount of sauce and toppings.  The Fettuccini Alfredo, leaves something to be desired. I don't know what it was about it, but it just wasn't what I expected.  Busy on a Friday night (to be expected at a restaurant / Bar), but very accommodating when I wanted to change my Dine in request to a To Go order."}
{"text":"best wings & pizza in henderson!! must have, travel hrs if you have to!!"}
{"text":"I hate to have to give Johnny Mac's a bad review on their pizza...but...truth is truth.  The last 3 out of 4 pizza's have been so so bad....that we couldn't even eat them.  The first one was great!  But this last one....wow...it was absolutely disgusting.  It was so greasy, soggy & the toppings were horrid (Johnny Mac's special pizza)!  I have no idea why they refuse to put something under their pizzas to prevent them from turning into gross rubber.  And I have no idea if they ran out of toppings....but the toppings tasted like something from a dollar store.  I'm not even joking.  You could put a piece of \"pepperoni\" in your mouth ...with you eyes closed...and you would never be able to recognize that it was pepperoni.  It was that gross!  I wish Johnny could supervise his kitchen \"cooks\" alot better.  You spend almost $30 on a pizza....and can't even eat it.  But...on a lighter note.....the fish and chips is pretty darn good.  As long as they make the fish fresh.  It's a hit & miss.  I had it where you could clearly tell the fish was sitting for a while pre-cooked before we got it at our table...because it was barely luke warm & a bit  spongey.  But another time we got it...it was so hot...you had to wait a minute to even eat it....and it was hot & fresh!  Spaghetti & meatballs is pretty good as well.....as long as you tell them Do not break the pasta up.  But beware of the 2 for 1 Spaghetti special.  You really get one spaghetti dinner that they split in half.  The portion size looks like it's for a child. That was disappointing.  The next time we ordered it to go....it was the same thing....so we asked the lead cook if this is what it's supposed to look like...and he said absolutely not!  And he remade our order to go & it was like night & day!  So that time turned out well.  Meatballs are excellent!  I've given up on the pizza.  I won't try that again....so the fish on Fridays will have to do!"}
{"text":"Being new to the area, we were on a mission to find a place that had great chicken wings. Johnny Mac's was recommended, so we decided to give it a shot tonight....big mistake. We were immediately seated and our drink order was taken by, who I thought was our server. When our drinks arrived, she offered appetizers, but we said no, we needed more time to look at the menu. About 15 minutes of waiting for our server to come, some other guy came to took our order. We ordered 3lbs of chicken wings with 3 different flavors. We were impressed on how good the wings were, I was happy that I had finally found \"my wing place\". That feeling quickly went away with the type of service we received. It was horrible. The guy who took our order and brought it out, never came back to check on us or to see if we needed another round. We were totally forgotten about. Finally the girl who took our drink order came to us and asked if we needed anything, she could tell from our facial expressions that we were pretty upset, we told her we just wanted our check. My boyfriend called it when he said it was going to take longer than 5 min to get our check! I was ready just to walk out without paying. Needless to say, the food was good, but the service was bad so we won't be back."}
{"text":"Holy HOT WINGS! WOW! Total surprise. We were not expecting much from this local dive but were shocked at the pizza and wings. Double baked and finished in a wood-fired pizza oven. You have to try the best wings in town. We will never go to Buffalo Wild Wings again."}
{"text":"Living in Henderson for 9 years now I have learned there are two sides to the city.  Green Valley and Old Henderson, and rarely do you need to venture to the other side.  In this case, because of Yelp, we took the drive to visit this place.  All the reviews below are accurate.  Its a great place to eat and take kids.  There is zero smoke in the air, the food is great, and kids can be loud.  The wings are some of the best I have ever had.  Full of meat and cooked perfectly.  What really surprised me was the panini.  We had a philly-steak and it was awesome.  Nicely cooked with plenty of flavor.  They serve Stella Artois  the exact way you should.  My kids loved the pizza and the other table's pies looked great.  The atmosphere reminded me of the great pubs back in the mid-west.  I would easily go back."}
{"text":"First time dinning in and the family loved it. There's a recipe for make good bar food and this place has a copy. Good wings, good drinks and a friendly staff. A+ on my book."}
{"text":"We ended up leaving another pizza spot because the service was terrible and ended up here on a whim. It was delicious! Great pizza and ordered the hot wings which were good and crispy! Great service. The place was packed and we had at least three people stop by to check on us. Glad we found this place... might be a good spot for football season!"}
{"text":"Place is fantastic, love their specials. Really recommend the wings and pizza! Staff is very friendly! It's a far drive from were we live but willing to do it!! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"A Henderson favorite.  We have been going here for years. Went in when they reopened after the remodel.  It was a good as ever! The barstaff always rocks it. Best pizza and wings in Hendo"}
{"text":"Fish and chips (Friday nights) was pretty tasty. Onion rings were great. The onions stay the rings when you bite them How do they do that? The cannoli were also delicious."}
{"text":"So I've been told over and over that I have got to try this place. I came I ate and I enjoyed."}
{"text":"I love this place and i have been going for 20 plus years. I always get the same thing and love their pizza, double baked wings and chicken sandwich! I really wish you they took reservations or expanded their waiting area, it's always super crowded. I will still be a loyal customer i just wished some other things changed with their expansion."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight from a friends recommendation. From the outside it doesn't look like much but on the inside is a nice sports bar meets small Italian booth style restaurant. Today was half price pizza day so we ordered that and it was really good as well as the service!"}
{"text":"After months of fixing up the restaurant, the new Johnny Mac's doesn't appear much bigger than the old, but it looks good inside.  Food is still good.  The only downfall is the friendliness of those that work there.  Standing with my family as we wait to be seated, at least, five people looked at us and kept walking.  Servers don't smile and aren't as friendly as they once were.  Still worth going."}
{"text":"What that saying, never let a woman decide whats for lunch?    For me it's not a bad thing, because  if I\"m taking one of my best friends out to lunch, and I let her decide...it's usually here.        Because it's not a date, so I can be a cheap ass bastard, and  jump  on my computer before we head out to this place, because Johnny Mac always has a restaurant.com certificate.  Johnny Mac is a sport bar / family restaurant / pizza joint rolled up into one, and has been a Henderson institution for the past +20 years, and my friend believe this place makes the best chicken wings and fingers in Las Vegas.     I really can't fight her on this one.   The owners are from Buffalo, NY, and prides themselves on using a fresh and never frozen chicken that soaked overnight in Buttermilk for their family recipe.  Warning:   don't order the viper hot!   you won't be able to taste anything after the first bite.  Yes, there's a bunch of sauces for the chicken, and the mild and watermelon bbq is pretty killer with these fingers.    The Fries are doubled fried, and has a nice snap to them.  Also, I love their Pizza, but tell them to bake it a little longer.    Their sauce is pretty killer, but just remember this pizza can get a little greasy.   So ask for extra napkins     This place is kind of dark inside, but service is very good, and there a bunch of LCD monitors throughout the establishment.     BTW, this place is a Buffalo Bill hangout during the NFL season, and have pretty good Sunday buffet during game time.  If you're from Buffalo, and getting a little homesick...you might want to check this place out.   One more thing, get a few doughtnut from Friendly (which is a few doors away from them)"}
{"text":"Yummy! Just flat worth it! Customer service and food A+ We always get 1 of his sons.. Upon request if possible. If not they are all good. It's addicting beware!!"}
{"text":"Friend recommend this place to me over a year ago and I love it. It's a small bar in Henderson. Best pizza in town I think. Always packed but I've always have great service. The owner or manager comes out once on a while and ask how everything is. Bartenders are really nice, chit chatting with everyone."}
{"text":"Hands down...the best burger in Henderson. Period. End of story. The Village burger is everything you could ever want and hope for. For reals. The meat is cooked to perfection, the bun is soft but doesn't fall apart on you and it comes with not 1, but 2! kinds of cheese. I think the kicker, however, is the vinaigrette they put on it. It's not overwhelming but gives the burger the most amazing flavor. The fries are run of the mill restaurant fries but the burger is so incredible!   Families shouldn't be turned off by the bar aspect of Johnny Macs. They have a large restaurant area that's fine for families. Lots of TVs to watch and the employees are kind, professional and quick. We had a pretty large party-7 people-but the food came out pretty fast, especially for a Saturday night.   I'll be back to Johnny Macs again and again. And again. And again. The Village burger is calling my name. I love it. I really, really love it!"}
{"text":"I was somewhat excited to try the food here based on the ratings. We (wife and kid) came on a Sat lunch. The restaurant was getting full but we were seated quickly. Friendly staff. Ordered a pizza special, antipasto salad, and 2 kinds of wings. The salad had no value for the $12 price tag, was no frills and not memorable. Pizza and wings came up next. Pizza \"looked\" great as they really brown the cheese. Sadly, it was like bread with toppings. Really soggy and lacked flavor. Serving it on a pan lined with tissue paper certainly does not help. It was also a pre-made shell so if this is something you hate like I do, don't order the pizza unless you are a huge frozen pizza fan because this was similar. The wings came in 2 flavors, one order was just cooked hot, the other was not. I'm not sure how that went down in the kitchen, but I did not feel like sending it back. Total bill was in the $70's I had one beer and a soft drink. I'll come back for a drink and the bar atmosphere, but won't be getting my pizza and wing fix here."}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant. I don't know what's happened over the years but it's really just not worth it to me anymore."}
{"text":"We live very close to here and have been wanting to try it for about 6 months now. First impression: the place was packed! Good sign. The menu is pretty varied which is nice. I tried the pasta with basil and a marinara-white wine sauce. Very tasty. I also tried the fried zucchini which was good but I compare all fried zucchini to farmer boys so thought it was just ok. My husband liked his ranch bacon cheeseburger. The pizza was a hit with everyone else. We were unsure of whether or not it would be family friendly since on the outside it seems more bar-ish but there were tons of families in there on a Saturday evening. Perhaps it gets a little more adulty in the late evening. Overall, cool place and we will be back."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING.    Reason 1 -- The owner doesn't allow smoking  If you want to go to a sports bar in Las Vegas, you pretty much have to surrender to the fact that you will be breathing in \"lowlife trash gas\" a.k.a. cigarette smoke.    Johnny Macs is the only sports bar in the Vegas area (that I know of) that does not allow smoking.    For that reason, it is a sports bar where people bring their kids.  It is nice to go watch a game with the whole family, and not feel like you're giving your kids cancer or feel like you need a shower after you are done.    Reason 2 -- the food  I am not from Buffalo, but my wife is.  So is the owner.  They bring in Beef on Weck, YUM.  The wings impress even the most hard core Buffalonians.  The ribs are outstanding too.  Everything I have eaten there was either off-the-charts delicious, or at least good enough (the antipasto salad, for example, is something that you really can't improve on -- it is what it is).    Reason 3 -- The Service  Every time I have been there, the staff has been attentive without being annoying.  Every time, the owner comes by at least once to make sure that you're happy with your food and your service.  This has happened to me whether it was a slow Monday night or a super-busy Sunday afternoon when the Bills are playing.  Reason 4 -- GREAT place to watch a game.  First off, if you hate the Buffalo Bills, stay out of this place.  This is a shrine to the Bills, and you better be ready to tolerate it.  I am a die hard New England Patriots fan, and I've never felt unwelcome in the place -- even when wearing my Steve Grogan jersey.  Even watching the Bills play the Patriots, people were cool.  But, if I were a Bills fan, I'd be here every sunday.  Even a non-Bills fan will enjoy it though.    All in all, this is a great sports bar, where you can bring your family or just come on your own.  I could not recommend it more highly."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  I love the pizza and wings deals.  The pizza is some of the best I have had, but I had to take away one star because my husband and my oldest daughter witnessed the guy making pizzas in the back eating pepperoni as he was adding some to a pizza he was preparing.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"Years of coming to/ordering from Johnny, I sadly report their food quality has dropped. The antipasto salad,my favorite, now is horrible.  An expensive salad which use to be worth the price. Look at the following picture taking after I arrived home."}
{"text":"It's cheers!!!! I've been coming here since they were new ( so was I) . I have never had pizza and fingers that compare . The best!!!!!! And it's quaint, and friendly. I only make it out to this neck of the woods about once per year now. But whenever I do... This is a MUST"}
{"text":"I love Johnny Mac's. But.....they need to be clear on their wing portions. Last time I was there I ordered 3 lbs of wings for my table which stated 24-28 wings. When they brought the wings out it was about 16 wings which is what is stated in the 2lbs. So, be careful. Mr. Mac is getting a little tight on his products. But, the food is amazing."}
{"text":"My family and I really love the food!! The pizza & wings are our favorites. Service is always exceptional.  Nice atmosphere, clean & friendly.  I have recommended Johnny Macs to my friends and they have always enjoyed the food!  No complaints.  If your  in the mood for some great pizza and wings then Johnny Macs is the place to go!!! Salad & pasta very tasty as well!!  All the food I have eaten at Johnny Macs has been good!! Try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"O. M. G. Recommend by a friend, we stopped here on our way home from checking on the house build. As we will soon be Hendersonians, we are looking for quality places close to the house. This may be the only place we ever go from here in out. And if you follow me at all, you know that's saying a lot cuz I LOVE me some Boulder City food, and this place could keep me in Henderson to eat. I devoured the Roast Beef on Wreck sandwich (think: the best French Dip you've ever had). Absolutely delicious. Huge portion of beef on an amazing bun. I've been told they bring the bread in from New York directly. It was amazing. I'm going to have a really hard time ordering anything else in the menu. My wife is quite the Wings snob and she absolutely loved them. She orders a pound, 1/2 Lemon Pepper and 1/2 Teriyaki. She does not like spice at all and these were perfect. She liked the Lemon Pepper over the Teriyaki. We were here in a night they happened to have Crab Cakes. Now, again, if you follow me at all, you know we are Crab Cake snobs. I've learned that you don't expect much at all from CC's in a bar, but try them we must. They. Are. Stellar!!! Tons of crab meat, and awesome flavoring. Pretty much the best we've had in Vegas, period. Apparently they fly the crab in from the East Coast and don't always have them on the menu so if they do, order them. You won't be disappointed. Pretty good selection of craft brew, they had multiple IPA's which is my wheelhouse so I was happy. No Riesling or Moscato in the wine department. It'd be nice if they added one of those. The service here was top notch, and they were pretty busy. We were really impressed by the service. We are super excited to have found this place. If it weren't Super Bowl Sunday tomorrow, we'd probably be going back. Can't wait to try the burgers and pizza!!! See y'all soon J'Mac's!!"}
{"text":"We have lived by this place for three years and always talk about trying it and finally we did. I really wanted to try the watermelon bbq wings but they were out. Bummer! I had the garlic cilantro wings and onion rings. Which were yummy! Our server was awesome too! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great little find. Went here for a late dinner after my son's speech and debate competition (restaurant was close by the high school).    The place was full and felt alive. Felt very cozy. The environment reminded me of four kegs back in the 80's.   We had a large pizza and 5 lbs of chicken wings. Very very good. There were 4 adults and 1 child and we still had a lot of left overs.   The food was excellent and our waiter was super fast and courteous.  We will come back for sure with friends!!  Would be a great place to eat and watch a game.   As we left the restaurant an overwhelming smell of donuts hit us like a ton of bricks. Went 3 doors down and ate donuts  at 930 for dessert. OMG so good  GREAT evening!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best pizza I have had anywhere.  I get pizza from here at least 2-3 times a month.  Wow!  If you dine in on Wednesdays, there's even a special price for it.  I've also had other stuff from the menu but I keep going back for the pizza!  Great place and I plan to keep coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"Literally the best freaking wings I've ever tried! The waiters are super nice and the price for wings are very good! Love eating at Johnny macs!"}
{"text":"First time here, and the service was bad, they forgot to put our Oder in and that's only because we asked if it would be ready soon, this was 40 min later, never once came to our table to see if we needed refills or if everything was okay, never again will I come here"}
{"text":"Best Cajun Burger ever. Onion rings are also off the hook!! Highly recommend.  Wait staff and bar tenders are awesome. Super cool vibe and clean :)"}
{"text":"This place is just amazing!  This bar is so friendly and the staff are amazingly awsome, I'm deffinently coming here again and I love the Yankees not my number one but my number two lol, the food tastes great and they have so many televisions to watch sports on them, they have bmx, nascar, baseball, football, etc. And nascar is deffinently one of my favorite sports go truex jr. The dining experience is amazing and they always check on you to make sure everything's fine just like it should be in my opinion, there dining area is very clean and it's amazing there dishes are clean as well which is points in my book lol, awsome experience and would recommend to anyone who loves sports as well."}
{"text":"This place is constantly good, so had to write review.  Best customer service,  very comfortable inside,  amazing pizza and great prices happy hour drinks! I love this place for adults, kids, out of town guests!"}
{"text":"We are \"California\" grown and here for a trip on Lake Mead and we're looking for a good place to eat close to Lake Las Vegas. We went by the Yelp reviews and it was worth the chance we took. The owner personally greeted us as did his son. We had the famous wings and they did not disappoint! We followed the wings with hamburger and sandwiches with onion rings and French fries. Great food and great family owned business- highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ohhhh mmmm geeeeee!   Delish!!  Great atmosphere and the service very friendly!   Definitely a local hangout and for good reason!   Totally devoured the wings and the heat was just right.  Shared the Johnmy Mac special pizza.   Hot, cheesy and perfect.  Top that with a brownie topped with ice cream and this is magical!   You better find time to visit Johnmy Mac's!  Henderson's best local hangout."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Johnny Mac's for years, and it is consistently a great place with great food and awesome service. They always seem busy and there's usually a wait time, but we've always been seated faster than the stated wait time. The servers are all very friendly and take good care of their customers. You can't beat their 1/2 price pizza on Wednesdays and my teen daughter loves their club sandwiches. The burgers are big and the servings are always more than enough. Great leftovers! Johnny runs a tight ship, and has lots of very loyal customers. The recent remodel really opens up the place! Well done!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times my order has been perfect hot and delicious! The first time, my fiancé and I had their cheese ravioli and a bbq bacon ranch burger. Their fries are so amazingly light and fluffy without a taste of oil! Just an hour ago we had their 3 cheese pizza. The mozzarella cheese was thick and stringy, ricotta was placed almost like tiny balls in a topping fashion. I would seriously recommend their ravioli. Over the top flavor with their sauce!"}
{"text":"If I lived anywhere near this neighborhood, this would be my haunt.  Went in with a friend for pizza, wings, and beer.  We ordered the little henderson special - a one-topping pizza and 2 lbs of wings for $29. First the wings.  I don't even really like wings, but my friend insisted.  Friggin' yum.  Cooked perfectly - I had the hot with the hottest sauce on the side - these are hands-down the best wings I have ever had.  And the hottest sauce was incredibly intense YET tasty.  Pizza gets high marks, too - perfect crust and sauce, and the edges of the pepperoni were crispy, just the way I like it.  The only bummer was a disappointing beer selection, but I settled for a Sam Adams."}
{"text":"This place is a sports bar / restaurant / family restaurant. It's hard for a place like this to stand out when there are so many similar such businesses littered throughout clark county. I would say however that most of them don't have the family restaurant aspect-- it was full of familes with their kids. I would also say that most of them don't serve food as good as this place does.  Twenty six plus years in the restaurant business and it shows. Definitely the best pizza I have ever tasted in any sports-bar/bar establishment.  I guess they make their own dough daily. We were a group of six so we decided the Henderson special was the best way to go. It ended up being a very affordable deal and we still had left over wings. We tried mild, bbq, and scorching hot. The scorching hot sauce was fantastic-- spicy enough to burn but also offering some other tangy flavors-- they clearly make it themselves. They also make their own bbq sauce --which turned out to be the best bbq sauce I have ever tasted. I eat at buffalo wild wings quite often and can easily say that these wings are miles above those of the corporate competitors. The next time there is a sports game I will insist to my friends that we watch it here."}
{"text":"Great pizza but wings were average.  Ordered at bar while I had a beer and bartender was very friendly and handled a full bar like a champ finding a couple seconds to make short talk with us.  We will be returning soon!,"}
{"text":"Trekked to Henderson last night and this pilgrimage was to convert my girlfriend to the artery clogging goodness of these Johnnie Mac Wings. She's been converted. Oh, the flavors are medium, hot, and firey suicide. I had the firey suicide on the side and it wasn't suicidal for me it was spicy hot but tasty, my eyes were teary and the nose was runny after a few. The staff is genuinely nice and expedient."}
{"text":"This is the best local food joint around.  Weds. night half price pizza is the best.  My favorite is the lemon pepper wings. I love this place and we take all of our out of town guests there and when they return, they want to go back."}
{"text":"Best locals place in town! They remodeled and it's amazing looks awesome food is as good as ever and the service is amazing! Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times...and never had a bad wing.  Their garlic cilantro sauce is worth driving from the other side of town for!  It's a non-smoking bar and restaurant where kids are welcome.  Pizza is decent and the tv's provide an awesome atmosphere for sporting events.  Service can be slow but be reasonable! This place is always packed."}
{"text":"Came in solo to catch the Thursday night football game while I was in town for work. All the employees I encountered were friendly and attentive. The place had a nice welcoming feel and plenty of TVs plus a decent selection of beers on tap. The bartender made me one of his award winning bloody marys, which was bold in flavor yet light in texture and just so delicious! Can't really comment on their food, I only had a salad & potato wedges but they were both great. Pretty cool place!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting in this restaurant now and I have to say it might be the worst experience I've had in quite a long time. I've been here for 45 minutes it took 10 mins to take a drink order and another 5 to order our food even though we said we were ready to order. We ordered an appetizer that we cancelled after 39 mins they brought it \"out on the house\" and it was the wrong thing. It's now been another 15 mins and I am contemplating walking out. I can say I will never be back to Johnny Macs."}
{"text":"A bar where everybody knows your name!  I'm not a regular here, it was my first time stopping by, but you can tell this is a local place and the regulars keep coming back.  We were greeted, got seated right away and served waters and menus. We had just missed the Buffalo Bills crowd for the big game as this is a Bills bar. Apparently it's standing room only during those games so I'm sure that's a great time too!  We ordered their fabulous hot buffalo wings and the white pizza.  The wings come in pound increments of 1,2,3 and 5 pounds with 8-10 wings per pound. The wings were amazing! Flavorful, spicy, buttery with tons of sauce and a homemade blue cheese dip.   We ordered a 12 inch pizza that has tons of roasted artichokes, roasted red peppers, garlic, tomatoes and large amounts of cheese. The crust was  perfect balance of chewy and crunchy ends.  They have daily specials, one of their most popular is the beef on weck which I'll have to try next time.   The servers were constantly checking on us and several different ones came by to clear our plates, grab us another round and box our food.   We appreciated everyone's hospitality and the delicious food!"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in, awesome smelling food filled the air. They staff was friendly and the food was really good! The vibe was relaxing and a great local place to chill, have a beer, and kick back. Would definitely recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"We hit up this place after getting some Frost Bites(Nothing wrong with dessert before dinner, right?)   It doesn't look like anything from the outside, but when you enter, this place is JUMPIN! at least it was when we visited. Hostesses kindly greet you at the door, and by the looks of it, there seemed to be at least 80% (maybe 90) of Hendersonian regulars that hardly ever venture out of Hendertucky if they don't have to.  Family owned and operated, they are out of Buffalo, NY....Birthplace of the Buffalo Wings and have been a Henderson institution for over 20+ years. The plethora of menu items here are unbelieveable, but we came for two of their specialities-Pizza and Wings.  The Pizza was good, but a bit greasy, and the wings....they were just okay, I guess my expectations were higher after hearing that they were from Buffalo. Oh well...The Watermelon BBQ sauce was tasty and the service was great, so maybe we'll give Johnny Mac's another try....maybe...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place they might have the best pizza in town. I live 40 miles from this restaurant and I work 20 miles from it, but about once every couple of months I drive down there with my girlfriend just for the pizza. And the ribs are very good. With the watermelon sauce they have some of the most unique flavor you'll ever experience on ribs. I I loathe bleu cheese dressing, but this place makes the only blue cheese dressing in the world that I will actually eat and enjoy. It gets 5 Stars purely for the food. Other than that it's just a bar with a lot of TVs. It's clean, the staff is nice, but it's just a bar."}
{"text":"Consistency, is the best way to describe JMacs.   Just completely redone with a much larger bar and high table area.  Wings and pizza will have you coming back for sure (as well as looking into Lipitor) Burgers are legit.  The Big Vin (sausage sandwich) is on the level of selling a kidney for!!"}
{"text":"These reviews MUST be from friends and family, The pizza tastes like NOTHING...No flavor at all...Wings were ok, but this place will never see my family again....waste of money..."}
{"text":"Very good place. Good customer service greeted when we walked in. Food is good pizza is very very good chicken wings were okay but everything is piping hot fresh love it. The bathroom very nice & really clean."}
{"text":"The Server was nice... The wait for our food was Horribly long... They said their kitchen was backed up for some reason... Kept saying your food will be out shortly... When we finally got our food, The pizza was good... The wings were supposed to be Mild but, tasted blah, no sauce at all... I come to Henderson often, don't think I will be eating here anymore..."}
{"text":"Went to Johnny Mac's for the first time yesterday after my husband raved about it. I love pizza so of course that is what we ordered along with wings (hot), fries and homemade garlic bread. I am not a wings person so I didnt try them but they definitely smelled hot! The fries were good (shoestring). The pizza was ok...I wouldnt go back just for the pizza. We had a party of 10 and did receive decent service. They include gratuity in the bill which was fine. All and all...I live in the aliante area and will not be traveling all the way over here just to have lunch or dinner. It was just OK."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Love to go on Wednesday nights and get it 1/2 off. Wings are good too.  It's a NY bar, so that makes it better ;)"}
{"text":"Picked up the Henderson special 2 weekends in a row. Wings are too dry and pizza is too thick. The place is just ok!"}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery 2lbs of chicken with deep fried zuchinnis and they're all burnt. We called and they won't refund or deliver fresh ones. What kind of customer service is this?"}
{"text":"The good: the food is awesome, it's a great little neighborhood bar. We've never had a bad meal, and you can't go wrong with the 2 slices of pizza and a drink for $6.99.   The bad: we have been here on two occasions where the service has been awful--both times we had the same waiter named Andrew. We had to wait 10 minutes before flagging down a waitress to get us another beer after our glasses had been sitting empty. Even after we asked the waitress for another beer she let Andrew know that we were out of drinks. Another five minutes passed before she came back and asked if we had gotten our beers. He dropped off a beer without a word five minutes later. So a total of 20 minutes passed with our glasses empty. We watched as the rest of the staff hustled around helping other tables as we waiting for our check, and Andrew was no where to be found. One of the other waitresses even gave us sympathetic looks and went to go get Andrew for us.  This is the second time we've had Andrew, and the second time we were left disappointed.   Overall: We will go back, because the food is awesome and the staff with the exception of Andrew is great."}
{"text":"Wife and I enjoy this place very much. When family is in town this is a usual place to take them. At the most we come here once a month. Only once or twice we've had to wait for more the 15-20 minutes. We usually opt for the Henderson Special(wings and pizza) so we'll have leftovers then finish off the meal with their cannoli dessert. If we're not wanting to deal with the crowd or a wait we'll call it in for a pickup and take it home.  As far as their wings go I love their watermelon and my wife goes with the mild. By comparison of other wing places in the area this would be our favorite but that's just us.  If we're going to a friends house for dinner and we're tasked for bringing dessert we always get cannoli's to-go. It's never failed us yet, they're so good!  Their Thursday night special 2 for 1 spaghetti and meatballs is pretty good. We've done this a few times when we're not in the mood to cook."}
{"text":"Food is good but not worth the extra dollar they try to charge! It happened to me and several other yelpers! Their menu isn't exactly cheap to begin with for bar food.   The food is greasy but delicious better-than-average bar food. The burger buns are huge and delicious. Service is hit & miss... usually mediocre.   This place could be really be good if they could get it together. As it is now you're taking your chances going in... so good luck!!"}
{"text":"Great food for a reasonable price, suggest you get there early as there is a long wait during the dinner rush but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Food is popular and well known in the little town of Henderson. Service is horrible. Worst Ive seen, probably ever. Place is always packed to the walls busy, regardless of the horrible staff. They do deliver though, so If you want to try the food, (it's \"Henderson good\",  not rave-worthy) order some delivery."}
{"text":"Busy night, employees were talking about customers right in front of waiting customers. Attempted to talk to 4 different employees and Couldn't get anyones attention for 10 minutes to put my name down for a table. As I was trying to get someone's attention a woman walked in and immediately got acknowledged, I left. Don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"We had heard about this place from a friend of mine's nephew who works there and told us to come check it out. This was back in December of 2012 and we just never got around to it. Then a few days ago we were talking about going out there to try it, but had forgotten the name! Literally the very next day we were out running errands in the area and were looking for a place to eat, so I hopped on Yelp and started finding something with good reviews that was relatively close. Saw the name and recognized that it was the place we were just talking about the day earlier! So we popped in! My husband had a burger and onion rings and loved it! I had the grilled chicken sandwich and it was to die for! I am not a big burger fan, but my husband is so it's nice that we have found a place that has a lot of options and a good burger!  To top it off the service was fantastic! Every waiter/tress in our area plus others checked on us many times and the food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Finally found a good beef on weck!  That and a real fish fry are what we miss most about our Western N Y roots. Finally found it at this Henderson strip mall. We thought it was very good.  Plied high on a kimmelweck roll, salty with caraway seeds!"}
{"text":"Johnny Mac's is a strip mall restaurant/bar one could drive by without even noticing- but you should take notice.  Most of the items we've had at Johnny Mac's have been fantastic and reasonably priced.  Another thing that makes this place is great is that it's smoke free.  Believe me, when you first walk in, you expect a cloud of smoke.  If you're going for draft beer, consider the $10.50 pitcher to share.  It is a good deal and priced better than buying individual pints.  Tonight we had the Beef on Weck special.  If you are not familiar with this Buffalo, NY specialty, it's thin cut roast beef on a toasted kimmelweck roll with a side of au jus.  Johnny's serves it with fries and a pickle.  I've now had this dish twice, and both times it was fantastic.  The meat could be a little rarer, but it is definitely tender and flavorful.  But, to me, this sandwich is all about the roll.  It makes the sandwich superb.  We also had the wings tonight, but they were out of the watermelon BBQ sauce I love and the wings were not crispy tonight.  I am not a fan of chewy skin on my wings, so I took a pass on the rest after one bite.  After coming for dinner multiple times and take out (pizza) a couple times, I would definitely recommend it to others and will be back."}
{"text":"Great pizza and beer. The Guinness pitcher of beer had a diffuser in the middle to prevent head. I feel like you get less beer because of this. Pizzas are flavorful and a great variety to choose from. Great place to sit at the bar drinking beer and watching sports on the television. Customer service is friendly with a smile. Finally tried the watermelon BBQ chicken wings and was not impressed. Really lacked flavor, so I ordered a side order of sauce thinking that they didn't put enough on. No, it was the flavorless sauce. The extra sauce is an additional 50 cents. What a rip off. Also noticed that the noise level on a 1 to 10 scale was at an easy eight. So if you are meeting people to catch up on the old times, you will find yourself saying \"WHAT\" a lot. The onion rings have quite a bit of water inside, which sucks because the breading is good. With not much to choose from in this area, this place becomes a diamond in the ruff. Still has great pizza!"}
{"text":"So last night, we went to try the fish fry. Btw, I've now been here 6 times in a month. I might have to move closer.   Anyway, it was very crowded being a Friday, but the wait wasn't unbearable. Especially with our high hopes. We ordered the fish fry and the 5 chicken strip dish with a cup of clam chowder to share. The chowder came first. Honestly, it was only okay. Not bad, but not as good as everything else. It detracted nothing though, so my rating stays the same. I was worried that the food quality would suffer as some restaurants tend to when they are that busy.  I worried for nothing! The fish fry came and hands down, kicks Crown & Anchor's sweet British arse. The batter was crisp, not overwhelming, and had excellent flavor. The fish was light, moist, and flaky. It was so fresh, no off-putting fishiness to be found. My bf loved it, and the portion was plenty.  The chicken \"strips\" if you can call them that, were enormous and so tasty. The white meat was fresh and moist. Again, they nailed the technique of battering and frying. Yumyumyum. We'll be back for Beef on Weck. Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I had bad service once, but after coming back with my parents they had gotten it together. The food is always good, the drinks are fantastic and it has a homey comfy feel that really allows you to relax. I will be a forever customer."}
{"text":"Maybe, it was due to Black Friday, but my family's experience was less then great, in fact it barely measured up to good. Servise was slow and poorly organized. Most of my party received their drinks in a timley manner, however the beer we ordered took nearly a half hour to arrive. The french fries we.ordered arrived cold, room temperature is more accurate. The pizza was hot and just a tad undercooked but tasty. I am in Henderson several times a year and was hoping for a regular place to hang. I may have to keep looking."}
{"text":"I have to say I don't see what you other Yelpers are so happy about.  I have went there twice in the last 30 days and am very disappointed.  The first time I had the wings and they were nothing special. The buffalo sauce is just Franks Red Hot.  Today I ordered a burger and an Ice tea.  The burger was so so. Obviously a frozen package beef pattie, definitely not fresh, and the side of ranch for my fries was not homemade either. The thing that really blows me away is the prices!  About $14 for a burger, fries and an ice tea, are you f*n kidding me?  Service is just so so, and food is very generic, unthaw and serve.  So don't waste your money, go somewhere that understands the value of FRESH, NONFROZEN products, and doesn't overcharge you for freezerburn!"}
{"text":"Best wings, fingers, and pizza you'll ever have. Food is always consistent and amazing"}
{"text":"I love how close this place is to my home.  Good wings and the pizza looks really good.  My mother-in-law loved their mozzarella sticks, which they make in house.  :)"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood bar with a very good vibe. Really nice staff and all are attentive and friendly. The infamous Johnny Mac is a great host and is on top of the action.  The food is the real star here. The fresh, never frozen wings are very meaty, fried perfectly crisp and flavorful. The portion is very generous for the price, providing an outstanding value and a memorable meal.  They just reopened after an extensive remodel. The new look is clean, upscale, inviting. While the bar and restaurant are packed there is a steady lineup of customers picking up carry out food. Obviously they know something about the food at Johnny Mac's!  I can't wait to come back and continue exploring the menu."}
{"text":"I was convinced by friends to give Johnny Mac's another shot... And I am really thankful I did!    Johnny Mac's was recently renovated, however I have only gotten to go orders since that occurred so my review will focus on that.    Maybe my initial visit was on an off day, the quality of the pizzas I have been getting over the last year from Johnny Mac's are leaps and bounds above the sad pie we were served back in 2011. I usually have special requests for my pizzas and they always get my food right here.   Pizzas here have an excellent sauce to cheese to topping ratio. Prices are a little higher than some of the other pizza spots in the area, and Johnny Mac's seems to be busy all day, every day so there can be longer-than-expected waits for picking up orders (and finding a spot to park can also be difficult at times) but overall, I am a fan of the renovated Johnny Mac's.    TIP: Half off pizzas on Wednesday, dine in only."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great sports bar atmosphere.  As Pittsburghers on vacation this June, we watched two of the games of the Stanley Cup final here.  Great place to watch sports.  Too loud for date nights, at least when we were there, but was still family friendly."}
{"text":"I've been going to Johnnys for around 20 years..  When you think of a \" Buffalo bar \" you think of great pizza and wings.  The pizza is waaaay better than a Pizza Hut or a Domino's. The Wings I think what makes Johnny Mac's a Buffalo Bar big plump amd delicious.  1 wing from here are 2 Wild Wings wing.   They even have great sandwiches they toast the bread and that makes them great.   Thanks for 30 years John!"}
{"text":"Me and my family have been coming for over three years! You can't be the food here everything is great! Staff is super friendly! Recently remodeled and the henderson special is our go to!! You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night, that was the first mistake. Even at 5:30 many people waiting for tables.  It was just my wife and I and we were told it would be 20 minutes.  After 40 minutes I ask the status and was told they had no idea how long it would take to be seated.  I saw others had the same issue.  It appears unless you want to sit at the bar or have a big group you should avoid this place.  Especially couples since in the 40 minutes we waited only one couple was seated .   I can't tell you if the food is any good since we never got seated so we left."}
{"text":"Oh goodness!! I don't even know where to start with this place!! I wish I could give it more stars!! The food is so delicious, we just have to keep coming back for more... We enjoy the bbq chicken wings, but really favor the pizza... They also have deep fried pickles, which to me is like heaven in breading... Lol The atmosphere is laid back and relaxed, with a nice homey feeling... The staff is so friendly, and they work as a team and you get taken care of by any one of them if you need anything... Tonight we had Andy as our server... He is spectacular and completely on point... There's nothing that we needed that he didn't provide within a few minutes of us requesting it!! I can say he's the best waiter I've had in a while... The bartender Luke is pretty awesome too... He greets us each time with a smile on his face and treats us as if he's known us for years... Everyone here is so nice, and I love the family feel!! There is not a single complaint that I could think of for this place!! We love it!! We will come back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Used to go here weekly with family but NO more sadly. Tried again and left again for 3rd try. Was sat in nearly empty restaurant by one of college age gals who is always so nice and helpful. She is the hostess with blond curly hair in a pony tail who seems to be hostess, busser, phone answerer and drink server is only person to give us time of day. Her hospitality is why I give 1 star...Once she sat us took drink order and delivered drinks we were forgotten AGAIN by a brunette waitress who's usually there regularly. We waited 20 min and nobody took order. Really love food and wish it had better service but after another table seated after us was getting salads we decided why did we bother. Guess the owner doesn't care his locals are not coming anymore....business on a Saturday afternoon was bleak. Try hiring more people so least an order is taken. I enjoy a slow paced local spot to relax but after several attempts to give redemption entire family has removed Johnny macs from choices."}
{"text":"This is the local Henderson spot! If you don't know about this place your missing out. Forget the garbage chicken chain restaurant on Sunday. Great food absolutely amazing wings! I bring my kids in here from time to time on the weekdays when it's calmer. Weekends are packed get here early or your waiting. Beer and food selection is great the service could be better. I've always been treated good but I've waited for my check a time or two. All and all you can't go wrong here after a day on the boat."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Large portions, fast service, good prices. Tables have paper so the kids can draw all over the table, keeps them occupied."}
{"text":"Located in old Hendo, in a less than attractive location, the newly remodeled restaurant famous for pizza and wings was the spot chosen by my friend.  I had a grilled chicken sandwich with a side salad, she had a slice of cheese pizza and a salad.  Service was friendly, but they were a short a server so we waited quite awhile between visits.  The owner came over, super nice, even brought us refrills.  Lunch for 2 was $29.00. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"My husband was craving hot wings, and had this place in mind. He went with the easy decision this time and chose 'hot' for the wings, instead of trying one of their other flavors. I chose the chicken tender basket with fries.   It was fun in here, as it is a bar. Duh, yes I know that is in the title, but it has been awhile since I have been inside of an actual bar. Ha ha. As far at this place goes, the service was excellent, it was clean and everyone was friendly. I will definitely be back.  Wings were very good, and my husband was really happy with his choice. He already has another flavor in mind for when we return. I was not really a fan of the chicken tenders though. They were absolutely huge. Really thin and massive. They were very tender, which was great, but for the first few bites, I thought that I had been served fish n chips by mistake. Even the taste was similar. That was odd. The fries were hot and tasty though. Besides the tenders being oddly shaped/massive, their price is really high. I will not be ordering these again, even though tenders are some of my favorite things.    Wings though, yes."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Johnny Mac's almost since they opened back in the 80's. My daughter even worked here as a teen. So obviously I like the place. That is up until recently. The food and service has been hit and miss over the last year to year and a half. This is disappointing since this has been a great place to go over the last 30 years for Pizza, wings, sandwiches, burgers, etc. But over the last year+ I've had some bad food and on one occasion very poor service. And my recent order was very bad. Over the last year I have had the wrong order to go more than once, a Pizza that was not cooked fully and the cheese had slid off half the pizza and stuck to the box. I had to try and \"fix\" it and throw it in the oven for a few minutes. I stopped in at lunch once, sat at the bar with maybe two other patrons. The bar tender came over, talked around me to some people sitting at a table then left. Came back a few minutes later and did the same thing. Never asking me if I needed anything. Then left the bar and went and sat with the people for a few minutes. Came back behind the bar, walked right past me and still never said a word to me. I cashed out the couple of bucks I had in the machine and when he came over to pay me, he then asked me if I needed anything. I just said \"no I'm good\" and left. The last order I got was pizza and wings. The pizza was fine but the wings were absolutely horrible. My wife and I could not eat them they were so under cooked. One bite and spit out. I ended up having to put them in the oven under the broiler for 18 minutes. Have to be honest, they were really good after that. Now I say the pizza was good but unfortunately after having to cook the wings, the pizza was cold. So in the oven it went too. It has now become a place where I have second thoughts before I order. I think \"boy I hope it's good this time\". Never used to have to worry about that. They were always solid with really good food. I sincerely hope the owner, Johnny, takes a good look at his staff and their skills and tightens up the ship or he will lose a longtime customer. I'm giving them 3 starts based on history but they have been much less lately."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. I read so many great reviews on this place and always saw how busy they were so figured we'd give it a try. We were seated quickly which was a plus. Service was good, not great. Food was good but the description of the item apparently is not what it is. We bought the Bacon Pepper cheese burger. So figured it was a bacon burger with pepper jack cheese. The burger came and no bacon. I asked the waitress about it and she said it doesn't come with bacon. She did offer to get some but didn't want to be charged extra. We didn't have the Sunday menu to look at it again so we just left it alone. When we left, it definitely did have bacon on the description. Not sure if we'll be back"}
{"text":"I was told of this place from a coworker. Skeptical at first but we shouldn't books by their cover. Got the Henderson special. Great deal. Have tried many times but could never finish it all...lol get the pizza extra crispy and the hot wings extra wet. The suicide sauce has great flavor. Good drinks and when you go friends it can be beat. Great atmosphere. Best pizza and wings in Vegas!!!!! Been here at least 5 times and will definitely be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love love the wings at this place! Best place for a dinner on a Friday night with the kids pizza is awesome too!!"}
{"text":"grew up eating johnny mac's ! best wings and beer in town. go see luke, matt and the rest of the awesome staff."}
{"text":"I went here to watch the College Football National Championship a couple weeks ago. (The game sucked, I don't understand how you can continue running a 3-4 defense all freaking game and allow the other team to run all over you. Apparently blitzing frequently is a foreign concept.)  First off the service was good, I had a medium pizza with Pepperoni,  Bacon,  & Canadian bacon because I like pizza. The pizza was good, so was the two rum and cokes I washed it down with. I had two slices left when it was all said and done.   I Def recommend this place, and going there. I also recommend you make the proper half time adjustments and stop a silly one dimensional team whose QB only average 20 passing attemtps a game from running the ball all over your butt."}
{"text":"We had pizza and twice bake bbq wings amazing!! Great atmosphere  they were very busy had a great special on spaghetti with meatballs 2 for 1 on Thursday's .. highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best chicken wings and pizza in town! Took my kids there and they loved it! A very family friendly place where you could also hang out with your friends shooting pool on a Friday night if you wanted to!"}
{"text":"Good local little place.  Food is always amazing. Stopped once for a beer while ordering food and the bar is comfy and has slot machines if you like yo gamble or play a dollar to kill time. The staff is friendly and works fast. I usually order pizza wings or chicken strips im basic but its fresh and easy."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA AROUND! I am an out of towner, but my parents live in the area and everytime I come and visit I always request we go here because the pizza is to die for! The service is great as well so you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Excellent, Pizza delivered timely then crickets no server. After grabbing him as he passed bye non attentive we completed our dining without incident. The food was excellent and priced competitive. Almost a perfect 5 stars, maybe next visit?"}
{"text":"Warm welcome for all New Yorkers.   Took me a few trips to get a solid review out of this place. My buddies are who initiated our first group outing here, so of course we enjoyed ourselves with some drinks from their full bar and watched football on the many TVs they have. It can get pretty busy during game days and weekends so be aware.  Our go to entree? The one and only Henderson Special! You can't go wrong splitting 5 Lbs. of Wings and a Large one Topping Pizza with 4 people. Or two people if your a fatty like me and the homie Christopher B. The best way is to have the wings double baked (try the watermelon flavor) and the pizza extra crispy.  Service is always on point as we never have to wave down the servers."}
{"text":"This place was a great find. Doesn't look like much from the front. Pretty classic sports bar setup inside. Lots of TVs, lots of ball games on.  What makes this place standout is the kitchen. Not just your typical sports bar fare. In addition to some huge burgers, the kitchen whips up some terrific pasta dishes and a whole lot more.  I had the Fettuccine Bolognese and it was as good as I've had at any Italian restaurant. We started off with some mozzarella sticks too. Not the typical ones that you get in a bar or a chain restaurant. These seemed like they had been breaded by hand.  Add to all of this very friendly staff. Definitely a spot I would come back to if here again."}
{"text":"Gonna make this short n sweet!   I had the best ribs I have ever had in my life!  My husband said that he had the best wings he has ever had in his life.   Enough said!  Go try it!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp found this awesome place! Food was FANTASTIC and the service was the best I've experienced anywhere in a very long time. Not just the waitress was great but when we were leaving we were told by at least 3 other employees to have a great day. So glad we searched out a local treasure in this city with lots of more commercial options... Totally worth it! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I am  originally from Buffalo, New York but have lived in Las Vegas for over 20 years and have been wanting to try this restaurant for years. Of course being from Buffalo I had to try the Buffalo wings. I ordered a dozen wings/ 1/2 order of cilantro garlic and 1/2 order of barbecue and a side of beer battered onion rings. The wings were outstanding meaty and very crispy and saucy the way I like them. They serve the wings Buffalo style with a side of celery and delicious blue cheese dressing. The generous side porton of onion rings were very crispy and coated with the perfect amount of batter.  Service was very friendly and even though the restaurant was packed my order came very quickly.. Prices were reasonable and included several pasta dishes, wings, pizza and other Buffalo specialties.  I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere. I will be returning with friends and family and definitely want to come back during football season to watch the Bills game!  Great job Johnny Macs.. I felt like I was back home again!"}
{"text":"Food was great service was fast and the server was very friendly and apologetic about the remodeling being done. I'll definitely go back"}
{"text":"How does Johnny Mac's have 4 stars??  The lunch service lacked service.  Our waitress came to our table when we first sat down, but then we lost her to somewhere in the back for more than 30 minutes. After we finished eating, we wanted more cocktails, but nobody asked. The food was just \"ok\" and definitely not worth their prices! We then went to the bar to play and drink but again, no service. Bartenders need to check back and encourage the drinks and play to get customers to stay longer and spend money, right?!   Rumor has it there are amazing servers (namely Gemma), but today's service did not meet those expectations.   In addition, the women's restroom was out of seat covers and paper towels. When the staff was told, they said okay, but then it wasn't taken care of.    We won't be back to give this place another shot unless Gemma is working."}
{"text":"Staff was so friendly! We got the family pack with 5 pounds of wings and you can get five different flavors. (The hot is really hot). You also get a salad and a whole pizza with one topping, all for $45. It's a ton of food for a great deal. Pizza was delicious and wings were really juicy and had a lot of meat. Great place!!"}
{"text":"I finally have tried this place out after numerous times of driving by and reading reviews. Let me say  NOT IMPRESSED. my first will be my last here. The place reminds me of a bar which is great but the vibes were off and I felt uncomfortable with my beautiful diverse family. The service was so poor we waited forever for our server to get us refills on numerous occations. We had finally put our order in and the order took well over 45 minutes to come to out table. The pizza was Meh nothing I would order again not even the plain cheese slice was good. We threw away half of a pizza which is not common for my family. The wings were OK honestly could have gone to BBW these were nothing special at all. Bland sauces and the chicken skin was super fatty and to get them crispy you have to pay extra. I won't go back."}
{"text":"I get into this place about three times annually. Last night, a Wednesday, was the worst experience I've ever had here. Wenesdays are \"all you can eat pasta\" and \"half price pizza\". I've never been here for this apparent extravaganza. As you can imagine, \"all you can eat\" meant people camped out at their tables until pasta was falling out of their ears. We arrived at 6 pm expecting a short wait as normal due to the popularity of this place. We were told 15 minute wait time...35 minutes later we were at a table! After placing our normal order of pizza and wings, we quickly learned they were either understaffed or just plain slow. The wings were delish...there is no medium sauce...it's mild or hot, and the hot have a good bite to them. There are other sauce flavors for the aristocrat in you, but Buffalo wings (to me) mean heat. The pizza was somehow different than my last visit many months ago. Maybe a crust change? It wasn't that great and seemed soggy towards the pizza center. Overall I was disappointed especially because it was 8 pm before we departed. This was totally because of the wait at the door and server response. Everyone is very hospitable and pleasant though which takes the edge off for us impatient types. I'll be back...just not on a Wednesday at dinner time!"}
{"text":"Pure Awesomeness!!! We have officially found our new favorite place to eat out. The venue, the staff, the food all were AMAZING."}
{"text":"We saw this place while driving by and stopped in for lunch.  There was a sports bar atmosphere and they were fairly busy when we arrived.  The building is quite large with a lot of seating with accommodation for groups as well.  The staff was friendly and initially, they were attentive.  Our waitress was struggling to keep up with the tables and seemed to go missing for a bit near the end of our meal.  It took a while for her to come back and give us our check.  We ordered the special 2 for 1 spaghetti and meatballs along with some cowboy bites.  The bites were smaller than we expected and didn't last very long.  The spaghetti, on the other hand, was huge.  They served it in 2 plates with two meatballs on each plate and two slices of garlic bread.  The bread was pretty saturated with garlic butter and I didn't eat both pieces.  The spaghetti and meatballs tasted good and I wasn't able to eat all of my serving.  They have wings on the menu, but they are a bit pricey and you have to order a specific quantity that seemed like a lot for the two of us.  it would be good to find them on special."}
{"text":"Have to say I didn't use to like the food but now I have to say it's a favorite. I love the beef on weck they do on the weekends . They're caesar salad is a great portion. I like the pickle and zucchini spear apps . Could go on and on. And luanna is the best!"}
{"text":"Been here 4 times in the last 3 weeks.  I'll start with the positive..  The atmosphere is laid back, fun and kid friendly, and I love the doors in the front that go up.  The food is mediocre though and the red wine is UGHHHH..  I've had pizza, pasta, chicken fingers, a panini, salad and a chicken burger.  None of the food is bad tasting but also nothing to write home about.. The kid menu I thought was reasonable but last 2 times I noticed on our receipt it's $1 more than whats posted, NOT COOL!  I think that's the case with some other items on the menu as well.  MR J Mac... Please update your menu prices as a courtesy to the folks that keep you in business.  The service has not been good.  The servers are friendly for sure which is part of why we keep going back but its slow and very inattentive.  I think this place has GREAT potential to be one of our go to places (maybe even replace Metro Pizza in our family nights out) but maybe they need a bit more staff.  Also one of my biggest annoyances about pizza, salad and wing places is not having homemade ranch..  The ranch here sucks!!  It can't be homemade.  We will go back since its a friendly local place and we really want to patronize these types of restaurants and businesses."}
{"text":"I've lived in Henderson for almost 7 years now and didn't try Johnny Mac's until recently. But after reading Shirley B's and Jessie B's reviews (Both of them have never given bad recommendations) my family and I decided to give them a try.   Parking: It's kinda crazy, and usually pretty busy as the Smith's store and the other shops close by generate quite a bit of traffic.   Service: 5 visits so far, all carryout orders. We've never been on hold more than 3 minutes when calling in an order. And when told orders will be ready in 15 min, they were ready in 15.   Decor: Johnny Mac's was recently remodeled but from the outside you won't see many changes. But step inside and you will notice the large bar with lots of HD flat screens, lots of tables and a clean decor that seems to be constantly busy. That being said it can get crowded at the front door if you're trying to get in to pick something up when they're busy and people are waiting for a table.   Food: We haven't tried their pizza yet but so far we've been happy with their sandwiches, wings, and pasta dishes. My son loves their spaghetti and this is one place that he never complains about if we order from them. Carryout orders also get doublechecked before they hand it over to you which is nice. It shows they care about what is leaving the kitchen.   Pricing: This is not the cheapest place to eat. Our carryout orders average $11 to $14 per person with no drinks. So if you eat in this could be a bit more expensive than you were expecting.   Overall I'm glad I followed Shirley B and Jessie B's advice and gave Johnny Mac's a try. We will be ordering from them again and if we ever get around to trying their pizza I'll update my review."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food, good energy, and really great staff. It's a Very unique and low key place to eat or have a drink after work for locals or for visitors. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. The hipster wannabe server stood there and wouldn't even make eye contact to seat us. After waiting 10 minutes, a girl finally offered to put us on a list. There was visibly 4-5 tables open at 7pm on a Sunday. At that point it was obvious they weren't capable of serving us so we said no thanks and left. Not even a apology. Pull your act together and drop the attitude. This is a local Henderson dive. Not some trendy restaurant on the strip. Won't be going here again!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years whenever we need a pizza and wings fix.  We usually go with another couple and get the Henderson Special which is a large pizza and a pound of wings. We split the flavors on the wings and it is more than enough food for 4 people. What makes the wings special is they broast them. This gives them their signature crispiness. I myself hate slimy wings so this place is perfect for me.   The last few times I have gone I had noticed the wings weren't as crispy as they normally were (bordering on slimy-yuck). When I mentioned this to the server she said to just let them know when the order is placed that I want the wings extra crispy. Apparently there are different degrees of broasting."}
{"text":"Chef Keller took us here My family loved the wings  I ordered an amazing fabulous linguine clam sauce.  It was terrific  I was happy  A lot of sports fans, young servers.    It was near my home and packed. It's located my an amazing donut shop  Don't skip the donut shop  Parking may be tricky depending and sonetimes a wait  But I recommend"}
{"text":"This is one of our family faves! We come to Johnny Macs every Sunday on our way back into town from our Lake House at Lake Mead. They have \"hands down\" the best chicken wings and my personal fave is their antipasto salad... A must try!  The staff is always so friendly and helpful! It is a Henderson gem as far as restaurants go...  They have a great bar if your going in with some friends or high / low top tables as well as booths if your enjoying a dinner with the family!  This is all around a super cool place for all occasions!"}
{"text":"It's okay, a little pricey for amount you get, not super clean. Service is decent, I remember it being being better so maybe I'm bias? Food quality is ok, i got the corned beef special, not rememberable or remarkable. Should have got wings, but 24 for 16 to 20... I'd rather go to bdubs and get same amount for less."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and my wife and I have only ordered burgers.  They are probably the best burgers I've had in the Las Vegas valley (I haven't been to any of the fancy-pants burger places on the Strip).  A few of the burgers have a cheddar cheese spread that is probably little more than Cheez Whiz, but it makes for a fantastically gooey burger.  The prices are good, the portions are more than generous, and it's a fairly nice environment that is family friendly even though the place has a bar atmosphere.  The pizza looks good, but I haven't tried it yet.  The only negative thing I can say is that the draft beer selection isn't all that great, but whatever.  I don't know if it's worth driving all the way across the city to come here, but it's a terrific place to go for food for people who live in the Henderson area."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.. I will never be coming back to this bar. I was ignored talked too poorly by the staff. T had flies everywhere and the floors were so sticky don't see how this place could have a good health code at all"}
{"text":"Best wings, bar none.  The wings and all of the different sauces make this a place to go.  The great thing about the wings too is that you can get a whole lot of them, like 10lbs of wings, that is just great to order by the pound.  The pizza is not all that great and the sandwiches are dry and not overly appealing but those wings truly are amazing, Have I mentioned that I like the wings yet?  Because I really do.  The rest of the place is hit or miss, the location is also not great, way in the back of a strip mall/shopping center thing.  But once inside you do not really mind the location."}
{"text":"I'm Very Happy with the Roast beef on weck Amazing. Poppers were the best i've ever tried. Thank you for a great lunchtime today"}
{"text":"Best pizza  n chicken wings in the world!!!! Love it! I go there all the time!!!! Totally recommend it!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place awesome sandwiches/ wings/ pizza  but SLOWWWWW SERVICE every time I've been in (even when it isn't busy) bummer."}
{"text":"Johnny Mac's is this Henderson \"Hole In The Wall\" that 100% lived up to its terrific rep tonight! When we arrived the place was packed, but everyone was friendly & we were seated before I knew it. One of the other patrons found out it was our first time @ JM's & suggested we try the \"Henderson Special\"....which is a large 1-topping pizza & 5lbs of wings! That was a bit much for the 2 of us...but I was happy to discover they had a \"small version\". We still had 6 pcs of delish pizza & 20 wings to share! Another friend of mine recommended we get our wings \"double baked\". Sooo good! The sauce & mozzarella on our pizza was incredible. & the bbq & med wing sauce was baked into the wings. So they were completely coated but not soggy. Celery was cold & crisp too, just the way it should be. Service was great. Never ran out of drinks. The wait staff all worked well together & were very attentive. This place looks a lil like a time warp. Neighborhood hangouts the way they used to be. And I mean that as a good thing! :) My son got a kick out of the jerseys & old pics. Our booth was right under this huge buffalo! We will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"It's pretty common knowledge that they have some of the best pizza and wings in town, but they also have the best burgers in Vegas/Henderson.  I had the bar b que bacon Swiss burger today and it was amazing.  You truly can't go wrong with what ever you order here"}
{"text":"OK, I heard so many good things about this place so I thought I would give it a try. I went there once brought the kids with me. They had the usual, chicken tenders and fries. They were pretty much the norm that I can find anyplace else. As long as the minions enjoy them, I am ok with it.   I had the linguini with clams, it was ok. Nothing to make my eyes roll in the back of my head. The bread was very good though, I can say that. I could tell it was fresh baked.  The service was ok, I don't remember her name but the waitress was Asian. She gave so so service, nothing more than she needed to.  I decided to take the children there yesterday after the last day of school. It was busy for lunch. The busser sat us pretty quickly and got us drinks. Then we waited, and waited, for about 10 minutes until someone came by. It seemed like they forgot about us or something. The waitress came by and was apologetic and seemed almost overwhelmed because she was so busy.  The Iced tea I ordered tasted funny so I asked if I could get a soda instead. She was so busy, she forgot. I got my soda after a reminder.  For lunch I ordered the two slices of pizza and a soda special and the kids ordered the normal, chicken tenders.  I heard nothing but good things about the pizza and was looking forward to it. When it came out, I was disappointed. First, its cooked in a pan the bottom of the crust was the texture of the pan. Second, it seems like their oven isn't hot enough because the crust wasn't that nice crispy almost burned brown that I love. Overall, the pizza was just meh. Nothing special and nothing deserving of such high praise.   On a positive note, I have had their chicken wings when someone got take out from there and they were pretty tasty  This place is usually very busy and serves typical bar food. It seems like it fits the need of the people in the neighborhood. They seem to have a big local following.  As far as pizza goes, I would go to Sunset Pizza which isn't far from there, they make very good pizza."}
{"text":"First time tourists here from Buffalo, NY.. Had the chicken wing/ pizza combo.  The wings were exactly like the ones from home.. We had BBQ and medium.. Well done with homemade blue cheese.  The wait staff was exceptional with their service and even though it was a local joint, we had a good time and would recommend this place as a low key restaurant for drinks and eats.  The brownie sundae topped it all off."}
{"text":"Wow. What a great jewel in Henderson. Awesome food   We stumbled on this place, heard about it before but never went. I can tell you they have great wings and pizza, will be going here again."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good for Vegas ...wings were ok. Good service. Loved this place as it was so close to home. Not bad"}
{"text":"Love the new set up!! The bar is awesome with a lot of seats and machines. The food is still just as delicious. Definitely will continue to be regulars!"}
{"text":"Been going to this place since I can remember. It's a locals place for sure some of the people have been working there so long they have forgotten how to watch what they say. Other than that the food is good and the service is usually descent."}
{"text":"Drinks are amazing. ....... i had a special order martini and sandra took care of everything.  I will return again and again.  Food is fabulous also pizza, fries, burgers, and wings made our lunch the best lunch ever........"}
{"text":"Ordered the Meats pizza delicious & pizza was half off because that's the special on Wednesdays :) fries for the kids as appetizers nothing special about them but service was good & not fast but they were pretty busy so it's understandable & then older man I'm assuming the owner very nice, with that said I'd come back when I'm in town down here :)"}
{"text":"Biggest con here is the price. Stick to the specials and you will be happy. The pizzas are good but nothing compared too their wings. You can eat for a couple days Cannot comment on their other food, we haven't tried it"}
{"text":"Just happened across this place while visiting Henderson. Loved everything about it. Pasta was really good, atmosphere was nice, but, most of all, everyone who worked there seemed to be having a good time. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best food ever, great bartender Luke, and amazing kitchen team. Thanks for the awesome wings and secret pizza!"}
{"text":"So, this little strip mall sports bar in the old part of Henderson on Boulder Highway is very interesting. I would say it is in a neighborhood that does not seem to be at the top of its game.    However, this place is packed and with families and kids of all ages.  Unlike any other sports bar!  i have been here three times now and can say, i really enjoy this place.  1. Crowded - Yep, especially on Friday nights and Saturday nights.  We went on a Friday about about 6:15, right AFTER the Happy Hour and so our wait was only 10 minutes.  However, we left at 7:45 pm and the line was out the door and packed.  2. Ambiance - Great sports bar, but a better place to hang with the family. The entire front of the bar is open so it is open air and when the temperature here is great, this is really great.  Lively, open and simply fun.  They should have one of these in the district or somewhere else where there is that community feeling.  3.  Food - Wings, Wings and Pizza.  This is what is great and what else would you want. Sure they have pasta, salads, burgers, and all other bar type food.  the pizza and wings are the key.  We had a half and half traditional pizza with cheese and the other half, the Johnny Mac Special with all that STUFF.  Meat, veggies thick, tasty and juicy.  We also had 3 lbs of wings for the 4 of us and they were cooked just right. We ordered the sauces on the side and next time will have them cooked with the sauce.  A little bit drier when the sauces are on the side and I do like them very moist.  Price - it's a sports bar, it's wings and pizza.  We with drinks and all spent about 20 per person. Not bad at all!  GK says, check this place out, just be careful for those busy times.  Friday and Saturday night, big games..."}
{"text":"This place was alright. We came here on a Saturday afternoon. It was semi-full but there was a lot of people waiting on to-go orders. I pictured this place more bar and less restaurant. It was the opposite.  they had several TV's and my pet-peeve. NO VOLUME why even have a tv in the 1st place?  OMG if you've read my reviews you know that is a deal killer for me. and I'll end up somewhere else.  We ordered wings and 2 salads. This must have annoyed this waitress b/c we never saw her again? she spent the ENTIRE time kissing the next table's ass. .and I mean giggling like a teenager at everything this table's patrons had to say, and would by pass us like nothing.  my bf finally said I guess my empty glass is invisible?  I figured it must have been. When we finally did get her attn and flagged her down to get the check - her whole tone changed. I guess the high pitched giggly tone and helpful attitude was reserved only for certain tables and ours wasnt up. Maybe we didnt spend enough?  sorry but I'm only going to order what I'm willing to actually eat.   WINGS: The wings were ok. we ordered HOT and garlic cilantro. The garlic cilantro had ZERO flavor. I was really disappointed b/c I like both A LOT. garlic is up there w/ salt & pepper in my household. The hot good though, but they were very very very VERY greasy. I think i used every napkin in the place. more napkins than BWW or HOOters cant be good in the calorie dept. and the taste wasnt that far above and beyond so IMHO the nxt time I go I'll probably try something else, and maybe get it to go to avoid bad waitressing."}
{"text":"A buddy of mine suggested that we try lunch in Boulder City a place he had heard about from numerous friends and family. Boulder City ??? Great restaurant??? Mutually exclusive. But I'm always looking for excellent hole-in-wall family run places. My GPS indicated that the drive was far less then driving towards the strip on the 215. Before you could say Corned beef and cabbage...the special of the day..we were there .Don't judge this super place from the outside or older shopping center. The menu is without the largest I've seen in a dog's age. If you can't find your favorite you need to see your eye doctor. Be sure to bring your apa..apa..appetite. The corned beef and cabbage was extremely lean with potatoes and carrots.Totally delicious. There are daily specials to please everyone. Half price pizza day...YES. Since a day without dessert is like a day without sunshine...i decided to take the advice of our waiter. Large brownie topped with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and whipped cream. Without doubt The very best I've ever had.  I think I've found my new favorite place. Btw the service was excellent with a capital E.  Well the diet starts tomorrow Be sure to get on their frequent flyer program...as well. Needless to say I highly recommend Johnny Mac's."}
{"text":"Good food but you need to get there early.  They told us 25 minutes,  waited an hour and we have 2 small kids."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Johnny Mac's ever since we moved to Henderson over 7 years ago.  We ordered Johnny Mac's for Super Bowl 48, and it was then I realized I'd never yelped about Johnny Mac's.  So, I had to remedy that....  Johnny Mac's is what neighborhood bars should be.  It's decently spacious with a good selection of booths, tables, and the bar.  We typically get pizza/wings/chicken fingers to go and usually get sandwiches or some sort of pasta when we eat in.  My favorite sandwich is the Johnny Mac Chicken, which is chicken fingers covered in hot wing sauce, cheese, and baked.  It's large too, you certainly get your money's worth.  The pizza is cheesy and the toppings are plentiful.  It's not a thin crust, but it's certainly not thick.  Somewhere in the middle.  It could have more crunch for me, but I think if they did that it would burn.  So, I'm fine with it.  The wife gets the chicken tenders a lot.  Her favorite sauce is the watermelon BBQ.  This has some actual watermelon in it, which gives the sauce texture and helps it adhere to the chicken better.  Also, the watermelon gives it a sweetness that is different than other sweet BBQ sauces.  The garlic cilantro has a ton of flavor, but it's thinner.  This is another reason we tend to like the watermelon BBQ more.  The wings are as advertised, large, and heavily sauced.  I love their hot sauce, it's a classic wing flavor with enough heat so you know it but not so much that your mouth is scalded and you don't enjoy your meal.  I recommend this joint for eating in and taking out.  It's a great neighborhood bar, and you get good value for your money."}
{"text":"This place is a Henderson institution. It was around long before most of what makes up Henderson today even existed. And after a quarter century, the place is still going strong.   Essentially, Johnny Mac's is a sports bar-type atmosphere that specializes in both Italian and American dishes. There are tons of TV screens showing a plethora of sporting events throughout the establishment. No matter where you are seated, be it a booth, a high-top table, or the bar, you're going to have a good-enough view of the action.   While the place is a bit on the loud side (being a sports bar and all), there are glass dividers between the bar and the normal seating. This is a much-needed convenience I wish other similar establishments had. Ever since the (much needed!) restaurant smoking ban, I have seen more and more people bringing their complete families, including children, in the restaurant. And the employees are friendly and welcoming of them all.   Perhaps the greatest surprise of all is that the food is very good! The ravioli and fettucine I have had here easily rival that of the so-called \"higher class\" restaurants around town. Really, I haven't had that many items here I didn't like (and the ones I didn't like were a matter of taste, nothing more.)   I have only one complaint with Johnny Mac's - they ONLY serve soup in the fall/winter months. Sometimes, when I come into a restaurant, I am not that hungry, and just want to have a bowl of soup. This is a shame, because the soups they offer in those months are actually quite good. Seriously, how hard is it to serve soup all year round? But that's my ONLY major complaint.   Johnny Mac's has been a part of Henderson for as long as I can remember, and I doubt it is going anywhere anytime soon. And that's all right with me. Good food and a fun, welcoming atmosphere make this one of the finest restaurants in \"Old Henderson.\""}
{"text":"Went one day after church to watch some football games. They had plenty of tv's however every tv was on the Bills game ! The salad was terrible limp lettuce 2 olives and a tomatoe . The wings were good and the service was also excellent . A sports bar should appeal to all NFL fans not just the Bills!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Johnny Mac's.  I haven't tried the pizza which everyone raves about, but I can tell you the chicken wings are awesome.  My wife and I ordered three different flavors of them and they were all fantastic.  We also ordered a spaghetti (substituted for ziti) and sausage dish.  It tasted great. Johnny Mac's is now officially my favorite restaurant in Henderson.  I will be stopping by whenever I am in town."}
{"text":"We eat here often and I can't believe I have not written a review until now.  It is a very casual bar/restaurant in a little dive-y strip mall.....but don't let that deter you....the food is great.  They have daily specials so make sure to check those out too.....but we always end up going back for the wings and burgers!!  They are AWESOME!!  The wings are fresh, not frozen and much larger and better than a Buffalo Wild Wings!!  We usually get them double baked because we like the wings to be crispy!!  The sauces are also great....they have the typical mild, medium and hot sauces, but they also have a Watermelon BBQ, Dry Rub Lemon Pepper, Teriyaki, etc. All of the sauces/rubs are great.  My fiance thinks that their burgers are the best and I have to agree that they are very good!!  It is family owned and the service has always been great....one time I wanted something that they didn't have and they actually went to Smith's to get it to make for me!! I can't promise that this will happen again, but it just shows the level of service and commitment to their customers!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, great wings with unique flavor options.  Large portions on all of their food.  Great local business.   **Will note that sometimes the service can be kind of on the slow end, but never to the point where I was frustrated.  I just don't come here when in a rush. :)"}
{"text":"Tonight was our second visit. Last time, we tried the wings, which were excellent.. And, the beef sandwich which was one of the evening specials; it was excellent as well.  Tonight, we decided to try the corned beef and cabbage, which is a weekly special on Tuesday nights.. it didn't disappoint. The corned beef was cooked just right, and the large portion was served sliced. The cabbage was cooked with baby carrots (which I don't usually add when cooking cabbage, but it worked), and there were two red potatoes on the plate as well. I believe that for the price, the meal could have included a side salad. Otherwise, it was really good!  We noticed some of the tables around us had wings/pizza combos. We can to go back for a third visit to try the pizza.. It looked awesome!  If you're looking for a friendly place that serves good food.. occasionally has live entertainment and also is very sports oriented, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Johnny Macs is located in Henderson, NV. It is a bar and restaurant located in a strip mall with Smith's grocery. The address is 842 S. Boulder Hwy. Henderson NV. It is usually pretty busy and locals frequent this place often. My husband and I love their pizza and wings. His favorite is one of their specialties Watermelon Wings, it sounds weird but we really like them! They do have carryout as well as dine in.  The atmosphere is your classic bar atmosphere, however you will find people of all ages enjoying the food.  Warning: During Football season this place is packed, especially if there is a Bills Game on.."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times since the remodel.  Prior to that it was takeout.  Tonight we did take out, a chicken parmigiana and a Johnny Mac chicken tender sandwich.  Disappointing!  Tuesday might be a night off for main kitchen staff but there should still have some continuity.  I did not recognize my sandwich with nothing but American cheese and the sauce was supposed to be a medium buffalo sauce.  Not there.  My husband said the best part of his chicken parm was the bread.  I don't know if you check your reviews but you should.  Overall, typically good but your  \"shoulder nights\" need attention."}
{"text":"Great pizza /wings, cold beer, good music and my new \"go to\" spot."}
{"text":"This place is Perfect if you want a local place with good pizza and burgers.  Staff was super friendly and the pizza was very good.  Atmosphere is very dive bar esk in the middle of a strip mall.  But it is super nice that place has been non smoking for 20 years."}
{"text":"I heard some amazing things about this place.  A group of us decided to come to Johnny Mac's after helping out another friend move.  We were hungry!  When you drive up, it doesn't look like a big place.  It's located in an awkward strip mall next to Smith's grocery store.  Even when you walk it, the hostess station area is super small.  It didn't help that there were a lot of people waiting.  We were originally told it was going to take 45 minutes for a table.  We waited for a few minutes and then decided to leave.  Great thing was, they caught us on the way out and said they had a table open up.  Great!  Once we turned the corner, I was surprised that the place is a lot bigger than I originally thought. The lighting is low and intimate.  There are a lot of tables and lots of bar space with a plethora of TVs.    Since our party was about 8 folks, we decided to get a couple of the Henderson specials for a little under $40 a special.  This special came with a whole pizza and a tons of chicken wings.  Trust me, it's a lot of food!  Our combined stomachs could not finish this meal.  The chicken was super crispy.  We ordered the mild wings.  It came with ranch that obviously enhanced the flavor of the chicken.  The pizza for me was a little oily.  Still a great meal!  I'm really going to return to this place.  I love the family feel this place offers.  It's a little slice of Italy and really acts as a double ambiance for me.  On one hand, it's great for families and big groups.  On the other hand, it's intimate enough for a nice date with that special someone.  If you're in the area, please come and see what this place is all about.  You'll be just as pleasantly surprised as I was!"}
{"text":"I'm from Buffalo and it was my first time coming here. The food was spot on. I had the beef on weck and my fiancé had the pizza special--amazing! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch during working hours. The food was OK but the service was horrible. Very slow, waitress never returned to check on us and when flagged down for her to bring salad dressing to the table she never brought it. This is definitely not a place to go for a working lunch unless you have unlimited time."}
{"text":"I've been going to JM's for years. My family was originally a big fan of the pizza it's  Fantastic. One of the best places for pizza and it's not a pizza joint. Then we started trying the chicken wings. For a guy who doesn't eat a lot of wings, I think they are really good. Over the last year I've been trying the Beef on Weck, a Beef dip sandwich which is available on their specials menu on weekends only. Boy, that is hands down the best dip sandwich I've ever had. If I were ever to move away from this area this would be one of the places I would miss. And by the way although they've expanded, plan on waiting for a little bit for a table they do get busy. I just wish they had a good place to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Tonight we were first timers in a sea of regulars.  We had a taste for wings and found Johnny Mac's on Yelp. We weren't disappointed.  Our server Gemma was great.  Plenty of additional menu options (most tables ordered pizza) and daily specials.  Busy when we arrived and a line out the door when we left.  All signs of a very popular place that serves great food at reasonable price.  Only negative is, as a Red Sox fan, this place is owned by a huge fan of the Yankees."}
{"text":"AHHHHH-MAZING!! I called in for pick-up and ordered a pasta dish with a pound of wings. The smell on the drive home tempted me so much. The food was great and the wings were perfection. Being from the east coast -- I know wings and these were amazing. Will definitely order from them again and hopefully stop by and hang out inside soon."}
{"text":"I think this is a cool place, I always like hanging here eating pizza :)  Sometimes you appreciate a vibe and this would be a place that has it. I highly recommend Johnny Mac's."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and heard about the watermelon wings, so I decided to try it. We did take out. The wings were okay, pretty chewy, guess I should have ordered double baked. Someone else in my party ordered a BLT. The BLT came with shredded lettuce, which is very odd for that sandwich. But the worst part was is that the menu says \"Sandwiches come with chips. Add fries for $2.\" I did not request fries, in fact fries were not even wanted, and they automatically gave us fries and charged us $2. Didn't notice til we were driving away, not worth driving back for. That is very rude and unacceptable."}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to Johnny mac's. So I am a big lover of Chicken wings and have been told by many people that these are really good. Josie has also heard such things and has been saying for awhile that we should check this joint out. So we did. We finally found a place to park in a very busy area with a smith's anchoring the shopping center. We were half expecting it to be very busy, but was pleasantly surprised that the majority of the busyness was at the to go counter. We were seated right away and our drink order was taken. I will say this is primarily a bar that also has a family section to sit in so do not be shy if wanting to bring the kids. Josie ordered a clam Chowder that was thick and had a good amount of clams in it. Some have just 2 clams and bunch of taters and usually disappoint. This did not. We then ordered the Medium thin crust pepperoni pizza and wings. On the suggestion of the waiter we got the twice baked wings. The wings were good but seemed dry. We ordered again on Super Bowl weekend and got the regular medium wings and were very happy with the signature wings and will from now on order them that way. The pizza was good and crisp with a great crunch. We ordered regular pizza dough for super bowl and prefer the thin crust over traditional. Both tasted great and we would order again. The staff here is great and very informative of the history of the spot. The decor is a great bar vibe and has garage doors where front windows should be.  Thank you for eating at Johnny Mac's. We are planning to return here and try the Fish and Chips since our go to place changed the recipe and is not as good as before. If you are in Henderson on deep Boulder Highway and need a refreshing beer and some good pizza and wings, stop here and experience this spot.   PS......I wanted to add that we just went and had the Fish and Chips and they were amazing. I want to give a great shout out to one of the food runners, Brandon. This guy was running his butt off. I thought he was our waiter. He got our beer, took our order, brought our food and continued to be involved in our meal. Near the end a lady brought us a check and said she would be the cashier. I asked Brandon if he was our waiter or if she was, he stated that she was. We only spoke twice to this lady. Don't remember her name or care to. Brandon got a gracious cash side tip for his outstanding work. I tipped what was customary to the \"cashier\". That's all she was to us."}
{"text":"Beef on weck! Beef on weck! Did I say BEEF ON WECK! most tender beef on a delicious kaiser roll that has caraway seeds and salt.  Johnny Mac's has mastered this, and their wings!  They have completely renovated the restaurant while keeping the original charm."}
{"text":"Our first time there we ordered the bucket of wings. They were Great going to tell all our friends. After checking the menu we are going back for the fish & chips. The Bar & Grill was clean and the employees were courteous and helpful.  Thank you for a great lunch for our guest.  Dennis Bichsel"}
{"text":"we've been coming here for 5 years now & absolutely love it (it's a bit expensive tho so make sure to try one of their daily specials like 1/2 price any pizza on wednesdays) - we come with our kids & sometimes the whole ball team for great pizza & AMAZING wings!  the staff is truly awesome & the drinks are poured stiff! good place to go watch a ball game & enjoy some really great food with the family!!"}
{"text":"There was a wait at the door on a Saturday afternoon (a good sign in my book) we got a table after about 5 minutes. Water came out right away and we waited ten minutes to order and ten minutes for food. The chicken salads were okay. Should have gone for the pizza  The house made mozz stick were the bomb.com! The big vin Italian sausage sandwich was good, but the bottom bun was soggy. The onion rings were superb. The kid had a grilled cheese and fries. It is what it is.  In conclusion, get fried food here!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2lbs of wings and it was terrible! Got 1 lb lemon pepper and 1 lb of medium. The lemon pepper wings had no flavor and was bland and slightly cooked/dry. It was like eating a piece of fried chicken wing. The wings for medium werent medium. What i got in my box for medium was oil at the bottom and fried dry bland wings on top. Terrible place. I have included pics of what i actually got and is a huge contradiction from other yelpers that ate at johnny mac's. First and last time going to johnny macs."}
{"text":"Came here starving, with the family, around 7pm on a Sunday Night.  Was seated fairly quickly and knew immediately what I wanted to order.  However, 30 minutes later, only the waters came out and I had to get my own place settings!   The person who brought the waters wanted us to wait for our server to put in the order.  We finally put the pizza order in the moment the server arrived, but still noticed that a party twice our size got their food before ours even though they ordered about 10 minutes after I did.  The pizza was just so-so.  Definitely not NY style that I've had in NYC and other authentic pizza places.  Probably should have came here for the wings but the 16 inch for $12 seemed like a good price for a fast meal.  The server was also so-so, after asking for the check, he gave it to us 10 minutes later.  The place wasn't even that busy.  Slow service and mediocre pizza.  If you come, the wings look like the way to go."}
{"text":"I found Johnny Mac's is now participating in the restaurant.com gift certificates. It seemed like the perfect excuse to consume several thousand calories in a sitting when I purchased a $25 gift card for a mere $2 yesterday!  Atmosphere: Dark, dive-esque, while still maintaining a family friendly vibe. It felt nice and homey.. I was digging it.   Service: Attentive and polite, can't complain  Food: So to preface this.. there were only 2 of us, but we needed to get up to $35 to use our $25 gift certificate. Being this is a reasonably priced dive type place, we ended up ordering nearly everything on the menu (or so it felt!).   Wings ($9.95/lb): We ordered ours mild, which I think in Johnny Mac's world means \"no sauce\" or \"flavorless sauce\". Despite our ordering mistake, the wings were damn good. I don't even like chicken wings, but these were perfectly fried and awesome. I can't wait to try some with sauce on them next time.   Panini ($5.95 with chips): We tried the philly steak panini. I really enjoyed it. A philly steak panini is a genius idea if you ask me. Fiance complained it needed more cheese, but I thought it was perfect  Pizza ($5.99 for 2 slices with a soda): This was absolutely dripping with grease. My fiance loved it.. it wasn't my favorite, but I'd eat it again! I love pizza, but to me this was about average.   Fries ($2.95): Fried to freaking perfection! These guys know how to work their deep frier.   Homemade garlic bread ($4.25): This was a miss. Bland boring cold bread with a big slice of tomato with melted cheese on top. Ehh.. not so exciting or good. I expected the bread to be toasted at a minimum.  Washed it all down with a couple of 20 oz miller lights ($3.25)  All this was a mere $15 with tax and tip when dining with the gift certificate! I'll definitely be back during football season."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Henderson, I literally picked them out randomly. This was 21 years ago and it was awesome! Since then, I have probably visited Johnny Mac's at least a dozen times.   As it turns out, years later, my nephew (Chris P.) and niece (Katie S.) have worked there for years. Johnny Mac's is a regular hang out for the whole gang.   Thanks for the years of great food and great customer service. I'll be seeing you guys soon!"}
{"text":"Came here for St. Pattys day 2014. Had a burger which wasn't great. Tasted like fish. Meat was frozen, not fresh for sure. Also, ordered the burger without some toppings which we still on the burger when it had arrived. The service wasn't on top of their guests and took forever to get anything that we needed."}
{"text":"Every time we visit Vegas, Johnny Mac's is always a must for great pizza and wings. Good for kids too."}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings West of Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Always friendly regular wait staff, they recognize your return and seem to appreciate it. I've never not liked something I ordered.  Wait time is sometimes lengthy but a good environment and usually worth the wait. We'll continue to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Love this local yankee bar. Always good service and foods not bad.  However today i sat and watched a cook(who u can plainly see from the bar) eating and licking his fingers while continuing to work.i almost had to leave but my partner wanted to stay. I'm going to think twice before going back"}
{"text":"A little too dark and cramped for my liking.  The whole Italian restaurant and sports bar theme is a little off. The food is really good, but would be better without all the noise of tv's. Italian Food is supposed to be savored, not rushed."}
{"text":"The pizza is great! Although, we arrived and were told they were out of pizza dough. We were told the mixer broke. So I'm assuming no one there knows how to use their hands.....very disappointed. Also, the guy that is SUPPOSED to great you ignored customers and had the personality equivalent to a bag of rocks.  Please teach your kitchen crew how to make dough, it's ridiculous there isn't a back up plan for broken machines. It's true that there are no more chefs, only box openers and microwave techs."}
{"text":"4 stars for food 3 stars for wait time on food   Johnny Mac's is a neighborhood type bar with really good food.  The Caesar salad is delicious, wings always crispy and sauced well, pizza is good, pasta very large portions.  And the servers are very friendly.     Only downfall is bc it's always busy, the wait time on food always takes some time.  I mean, get comfortable it's going to be a while.    But the food is good.  So you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Johnny Mac's is Henderson. They take pride in being a culture staple of our city. It's always just a bit murky in there. I'll always order my food( pizza and those yummy double baked waaaangs) and take it home just because I don't want to be there.   I'm aware that they have updated their decor. Maybe the murky feels will have gone away with new wallpaper."}
{"text":"Definitely one of your go to local bars. It's small it's nice and friendly, and they have a jalapeño style pizza. Excellent little place for a guys night and to catch a game or two during football season."}
{"text":"Ordered last night a to go order. I had a Italian sub which in my opinion Subway has them beat.  My husband had the meatball sandwich which he said was very good but the deep fried mushrooms were overcooked.  We usually order wings and pizza and love them.  I guess you should stick to what you know is good."}
{"text":"Johnny, your baked ziti used to be awesome, your wings used to be crispy, your pizzed used to weigh twice as much and was incredible and your beer used to be cold. I have lived down the street for 15 years. My friends and I used to visit weekly for the reasons above.  I have met you a couple of times and you seem like a great guy. I want to provide honest feedback in hopes that we can make your place a favorite again. Sure, the new tv's you installed were a nice touch, but what will bring us back is a renewed focus on the food. The last time I was there, I had to ask Gemma for ice cubes for our draft beers. No excuse. Based on recent reviews, the wings are still not crispy. Folks want crispy wings and cold beer. The baked ziti and other Italian dishes used to be amazing. The pizza used to weigh twice as much (which tells me the quality of the cheese was better). Not sure if this is a chef issue or a focus issue, but we want to come back! Hope you take this review as intended, just honest feedback in hopes that we can help support our local neighborhood business again. No one one wants to go to PT's on Boulder and Horizon. Trust me. Thanks Johnny!"}
{"text":"Great wings and beer. Great service! Usually sit at a table or booth. Can call ahead for carry out. Ordered carry out for Super Bowl Sunday. They were very busy but order was ready and service was great even if very busy."}
{"text":"I'll give the wait staff 5+ stars but I have 2 complaints about the restaurant. 1. You're a local joint. Support your local brews! 2. Why do you have a mushroom burger on the menu and put canned mushrooms on it? DISGUSTING! I'll be back for wings and fries."}
{"text":"Best place for wings in Las Vegas.  Having attended college in Buffalo, NY I have a grand affinity to wings and these have been the best so far.  The traditional hot sauces are great, the lemon pepper is fantastic, but their watermelon sauce is something that is special and unique.  You can also get the watermelon sauce on your ribs!  The wing aren't all that is great here.  The burgers are awesome, the ribs are fantastic, the pizza is delicious, and the daily specials make you want to come back every day to try something else. They also feature a Buffalo staple, Beef on Weck, which is awesome.  Come here with the family, come with friends, come on a date.  Enjoy the friendly and welcoming atmosphere and their newly renovated dining room! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The 4 stars is simply for the food. The staff seems to not really care about the customers. If they are busy don't even bother, long waits and poopy staff. The location is a bit stuffy, be careful when walking around their front door. One of their staff members slammed the door open and just about knocked me off the sidewalk, said sorry and kept walking. He was lucky I was not an elderly or they would be facing a lawsuit."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in Johnny Mac's. I went there on Mothers Day, because I did not want to wait in line anywhere due to it already being 630pm. I called to check on how busy it was and if there was a wait and they told me if i came within 10 mins she would seat my party of 6. We (4 of us) arrived, She seated us within a few mins. A younger gentleman came over and  had taken our drink order.10 minutes Later the waiter comes over to get our drinks and we tell him someone has already taken our request. Hes says ok and walks away. Our drinks come and he tells us the waiter will be with you in a few minutes The last 2 guest of our party arrive, they take their drink order and bring them child size cups!? The waiter hears us laughing about it then we notice the guy comes back and changes them out. Long story short. It took over an hour to receive our food. The waiter being very apologetic about it the whole time. Anyways.. After receiving our Appetizers for a party of 6, We had to ask for plates! Who drops off appetizers without plates?(someone from the kitchen) Then our dinners..One pasta order had SO much water on it, it looked like soup. The waiter apologized commenting the cook is new. Then my sons pasta was a childs size portion! The waiter tells him I know this is a child size portion, again I apologize, like I said the cook is still learning & I'm going to bring you another portion(that never happened) the watered down pasta had to be switched out due to no flavor whatsoever. My husbands spaghetti & meatballs portion was a joke. I asked for ranch repeatedly until I just started to share my daughters ranch than the busperson was asked if he could bring me some. We never recieved our extra napkins we kept asking for. We had to get up& get our own 'to go boxes'.It was not even that busy to even have that long of a wait.The waiter never even came one time to ask how everthing was, we had to flag him or the busperson down everytime we needed something. I am embarrassed I told my kids this place was really good and they'd like it. I have only ordered chicken fingers&pizza from here, I guess that was my mistake #1. Mistake #2 I usually take out. My bill being over 120.00 and yes still leaving a good tip for the busy waiter! I wanted to let you know we were not happy at all. Quality of food was very poor. Customer service was poor. Prices were poor. Don't think I will return here for a 'family dinner' again. Not to mention it was soo cold, we had to go get sweaters out of the car just to quit shivering. We could hear everyone complaining about it being cold and the wait. Not good Johnny Mac's..Not good.."}
{"text":"Maybe its just me...I've never had buffalo wings that have ever blown me away.  Most of them are done the same way everywhere.  I honestly can't tell that much of a difference between this place and any Buffalo Wild Wings although the wing meat at Mac's was pretty dry and some of the drumettes barely had any meat on them.  Definitely a one and done place for me.  Not worth the trek from SW Vegas for."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Johnny Macs.  They service is always friendly.  The owner is always around and the food is amazing. Try the meatball and basil pizza!"}
{"text":"Went here because of a restaurant.com certificate and loved it.  Everything was really good and tasted like it was homemade. After eating at the pretentous, trendy Little Buddha restaurant at the Palms, this place was a breath of fresh air.  Here's a rundown of some of the food we had:  Salad - tasted fresh, salad dressing was homemade (a vinaigrette) Wings - had a choice of about 8 different sauces, went with the Hot.  Was some of the best wing sauce I have ever tasted.  Wings themselves were cooked fairly well and was crisp.  Was not overauced like at most places and did not overpower anything. Fries - cooked well, tasted like they were double fried so had a nice crisp. Pizza - a little greasy but one of the best pies we've had since we moved here.  Sauce had a nice tang to it.  On top of it, they gave both myself and my husband a free beer.  This is going to be a regular place for us."}
{"text":"Visiting from SoCal and completely blown away with the friendly, but SUPER fast service, delicious food, and great sports bar ambiance (so many TV's and great bar). Will definitely be making a stop here when we decide to come back down."}
{"text":"We are from Minnesota and staying at Lake Las Vegas.  We happened to be in town during the NCAA Frozen Four and our alma mater was playing, North Dakota.  We wanted to find a place to watch the game and assumed hockey was probably not at the top of any list to watch at any local establishment.  We googled and found Johnny Mac's and actually emailed ahead of time to find out if they would play the game if we came.  They got back to us right away and told us to come on down!    We arrived early to get a good table and asked if they could put the game on.  They acknowledged our email and not only turned one TV to the game but three so we could have a birds eye view from every direction.  The owner Johnny came to our table and introduced himself and chatted for quite some time.  Very friendly, from Buffalo, NY so we knew the wings had to be good.  Once the game started he even turned the volume on so we could have the full experience.  Very accomodating.  We literally ate our way through the game.  We had fried zucchini and 2 lbs of wings to start.  Best wings I have ever had!!  We ordered one pound with HOT sauce and one pound mild.  Crispy, delicious and the ranch and bleu cheese were on point.    We followed that up with pizza and fettucine alfredo.  The pizza was awesome!  We ordered the Mac's special and each slice was a meal in itself.  I added chicken and mushrooms to the fettucine alfredo and it was to die for.  The sauce was so good.  Everyone was eating off my plate.    Lastly we of course had to finish with desert.  We had the cookie and ice cream.  They make a from scratch cookie in a mini pie pan and top with ice cream and hot fudge.  Literally comes right from the oven to your table.  We were fighting over the last bite.  The service was impeccable.  They tag team each table so you always get what you need very quickly.  You would ask the person checking on your table for a refill and it would show up moments later from a different server.  It is hard to master this model and they have.    Loved the local crowd.  Everyone that sat around us ended up talking with us and interested in hearing about the game.  We had everyone cheering for North Dakota by the time we left.    Other than being in Philadelphia for the actual game, there would be no where else I would have wanted to watch the game than at Johnny Macs!  We will definitely visit this place everytime we are in town.    Well done Johhny and team!  Great food, great people and a great experience."}
{"text":"I'm here to say that I love Johnny Macs. And I highly recommend eating here as often as you can. The food is great. They are great. And I am always so full I want to vomit. In the best most positive way."}
{"text":"Food is great,  true buffalo,  NY style pizza and wings. Great sports bar as well and if you're from western new York,  this place is home away from home."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and food is good...pizza, wings and watermelon bbq sauce...a hidden gem..."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a bite after a long drive while moving from Oregon to Phoenix. We were super excited to find this little gem where we could order some food and have a drink. We decided to get the Henderson Special which was 5lbs of wings and a Lg pizza. Both were delicious and there was way more then enough food!  The only downside was the service was a little slow, but the place was packed. We will definitely be back on one of our return trips to the area."}
{"text":"Don't judge the place by the area. It is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"The wings were really good! Came for the wings but fell in love with the pizza. They have different combos but it's only a few dollars more for almost double the food so you should get it as long as you don't mind left overs. Good thing is that these were still good the next day.   I preferred the regular buffalo medium but the watermelon bbq was pretty good. Have been here twice as it's a pretty far drive for me but I'm willing to take a side trip if I am in Henderson."}
{"text":"Great local place! Pizza was delicious! Had a brownie dessert that was warm and yummy! No complaints!"}
{"text":"Food is a step above most bar food. Service is hit and miss... portions are pretty good.   Pizza and wings are crazy expensive and should only be purchased if they have a special.   Daily specials are good, chicken fingers are awesome... sandwiches are pretty good.  Favorite thing is the giant soda cups! And they usually hook it up with a cup to go with out having to ask. That's why I come back! Love my soda back at work."}
{"text":"As a Buffalonian, I know how wings and pizza should taste. Johnny brought a piece of the famously made Buffalo cuisine to an area desperately in need of a non-chain experience .   If you have the pleasure of coming across this gem in the desert, get their pizza and wings!!!   Wings: Crispy and big, just the way they should , nay,  MUST be prepared.  Pizza: Between New York and Chicago , the crust falls right in the middle...per the Western New York Style. The sauce is a little bit sweet and the cheese is piled high.   Overall: Go visit Johnny, without the burden of going to Buffalo. Our food is amazing, but let's be honest, we'd rather eat it somewhere else. Johnny Mac's in Henderson is the place!"}
{"text":"The menu prices and the prices you are actually charged are \"subject to change.\" So beware you might be charged more for your meal without warning like I was. It the food was better or I was at least warned beforehand I might not have minded. Even the specials menu with the current date on them have the wrong price on them. It was a complete rip off and I will not be going back to this establishment."}
{"text":"We always go for the family night special. 5lbs wings,  large salad and large pizza. Service is spotty as you can have more than 1 person waiting on you.  They just added all new and more big screen tvs."}
{"text":"Service is fantastic and the food was good. I really appreciated how cold the beer was and how often the staff checked on me. Great value."}
{"text":"It's definitely time that I update my review, since quite a bit has changed at good ol' Johnny Mac's!  They recently completed a large remodel, which expanded the size of their dining room. It looks really great inside!   We dine here about once a week - the service is always friendly and the food is delicious. On Friday, Saturday and Sundays they feature beef on weck, which I can't resist. We've had so many things on their menu - I love the bacon, mushroom and 3 cheese burger as well as the chicken parm sub. My Mom loves to order the ziti with veggies and my Hubby is obsessed with their version of a chicken finger sub. The chicken wings are big, meaty and juicy.   It's still smoke free and also family friendly. We take our baby there often. It's a Buffalo Bills bar, so during football season they show all of the Bills games and attract a very large crowd.   I am so happy to have Johnny Mac's in the neighborhood and enjoy supporting a small, local and family owned business. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Best wing in town!!  Pack your patients it takes a while to get seated.  Once seated you will experience great service and a lot of happy dining. I have never been disappointed here.  Great for take out also.  Wish there was one closer to my house!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their drink tastes are pretty inconsistent depending on who's making it. I have never not liked the drinks though. They have great pizza, amazing wings, big cheese burgers, and anti-pasta salad to die for."}
{"text":"First time here tonight. When they get busy, the servers seem to get a bit overwhelmed, but it doesn't take away from the food. We tried the burgers and they were awesome. Pictures are below. Prices are average and this is the first place we have been to that will offer onion rings with your burger or sandwhich without an up charge. We will definitely be back for more and highly recommend this to others."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times over the years, and it has always been a quality meal. It's a nice restaurant/bar with gaming, and smoke free.   My disappointment was I ordered the wings and was so excited to eat them because usually I go with a pasta dish, but the wings were getting rave reviews and I was in the mood for them. I ordered with the watermelon bbq sauce. Oh I'm sorry, we are out. OK, how about the garlic cilantro? Oh sorry, we are out of that as well. I finally just went with plain and ranch dressing, and the wings were nicely done being fried in rice oil, but had no flavoring at all, salt, pepper, or anything.   I'll go back and try again in the future because the watermelon bbq sauce is something I really want to try. But a restaurant should not run out of popular items first thing in the morning mere minutes before a busy lunch hour."}
{"text":"I've come to this family owned restaurant since I was a kid, they have amazing New York style pizza, and delicious desserts that I can never turn down. Most of everything I've gotten off the menu has been good. It's best to get here before 5 or 6, especially on a weekend because it gets busy real fast and you could be waiting for a table for quite awhile. Most of the time our service is great as well, but some times it can be iffy. Just depends on who you get, really. Definitely a relaxed, low atmosphere. On nice evenings they'll open up these garage door type windows, so it's like sitting outside. If you ever want some amazing pizza, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The food and service were great. The sandwiches and pizza were awesome. Definitely going back for more!  I'll make sure I get pics next time."}
{"text":"This was my 1st visit here @ Johnny Mac's and my neighbor was right on the money. The food here is very good. Wednesday night is half off on the pizza.  When fronds and family come to visit, I 'll bring them here to try the wings,  But for sure we'll be ordering a large pizza.  JP"}
{"text":"I honestly would have never even step foot in this restaurant had it not been recommended to me. From the outside it looks like a bleak, typical \"hole in the wall\" restaurant but inside's a different story!   I learned about Johnny Mac's through my bf on Facebook and became a fan. We found out Wednesday nights are when all pizzas are half off (what a deal!) and WOW...let me tell you...this was the best pizza I have tasted in a long time. I am not a big sauce person but I loved theirs, the mozzarella was so stringy and delicious, the toppings were fresh and the crust was fluffy. Our pizza only came out to be $8!!! Not only that but my little one ordered spaghetti off their kids menu ($3.95) and I think I ended up eating more than she did. It also came with two yummy pieces of garlic bread which I kinda stole too. Oops ;)  It is a sports bar and the fans get loud when games are on...which oddly made it a good choice for me to bring my 4 year old to this restaurant. I wasn't constantly telling her to keep her voice down which was nice. It is a kid friendly establishment and a really nice touch was  the white paper that were on the tables. The hostess gave her a cup of crayons and she went to town coloring the paper!  I look forward to going back to this reaturant. I'm excited to try more of their dishes. I've learned, don't judge a book by it's cover...give Johnny Mac's a try. It will pleasantly surprise you!"}
{"text":"One of the only places I like to go! The bar staff, especially Luke, is A++, the wings are the best I've experienced so far (watermelon twice baked with a little suicide sauce), and the other foods are outstanding as well. Also, best Martini I've had in Henderson. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"We were treated here by relatives who wanted to introduce me and Diane to many of the comfort food treats that abound here in this long-standing pub/sports bar/pizza and chicken wings joint that caters to Buffalo Bills fans.  After about a 15-minute wait for a table because the place was fully packed on a Friday night, I was pleased with most everything I sampled.    Mozzarella Sticks oozing with cheese were very good as a starter, while twice-baked and somewhat moist Buffalo Wings and thin Fried Pickle Spears served with a vibrant dressing for dipping were good.  I just would have preferred thicker spears.  A Small House Salad with fresh greens, tomatoes, celery, carrots, Green Olives, pepperoncini, and homemade croutons topped by a Traditional Italian Dressing was good but not that small.  And I would place a saucy and very sweet Pepperoni Pizza within the upper pantheon of sports bar pizza.  My main dish for the evening was the two-for-one Friday Pasta Special of the Day Spaghetti and House Meatballs mixed with Johnny Mac's very good heat-hot and mellow Signature Tomato Sauce.  The portion was generous, and the meatballs mixed with Italian Parsley were well seasoned, slightly tangy, and delicious.  Two thin slices of Garlic Bread were also very tasty.  I definitely will be back soon to try other featured dishes, especially the Meatloaf served on Mondays, Corned Beef & Cabbage and Reuben Sandwiches served on Tuesdays, Fish & Chips prepared on Fridays, and Roast Beef--sliced beef served on a Kimmelweck Roll--available on Fridays and Saturdays, reportedly a Buffalo, New York hometown favorite.     Service was friendly and efficient.  Offering casual dining amid piped in, pulsing music, this is a loud, active, and fun place to frequent!"}
{"text":"Usually I would rate them 4. Service is always crappy but the good is always great. Well tonight we sat for 34 minutes without anyone checking in us. I finally grabbed someone and asked them to check our food and then the server magically appeared and said he hadn't forgot about us. At about 45 minutes they brought some of our food and some wrong food so we walked out."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review for a while now.  I dined here during the last week of December with a restaurants.com gift card.  I got a bad feeling right off the bat when the owner was barked at 3 of his staff members right in front of myself and my kids.  He really didn't even care that we were standing there.   We stood around (with no one in front of us) for 5 minutes with no acknowledgment before the hostess got us to a table.  We sat at our table for about 45 minutes before our waitress even got to us to take our order... yes, you read that right 45 minutes!!  And, this was after having the hostess come by several times to apologize and say she would get the waitress over.  When the waitress finally made it over, she couldn't have cared less.  Seriously, it was like she was irritated she had to take our order.  We were there for over an hour by the time our mediocre pizza made it to our table.  After we finished eating, we again sat for about 20 minutes waiting for our waitress to bring a box and she never came.  So, I got up AGAIN to see if I could bother someone to give us a box so that we could leave since this dinner was now going on over 2 hours.    After all of this, and I was livid at this point, imagine my surprise when I was automatically charged an 18% gratuity... for the worst service I had experienced in a while.  I'm not sure if it's because we used a restaurants.com gift card or what... but if you don't want to accept them, then don't.      *  Horrible service *  Overpriced & mediocre food *  Automatically charged 18% gratuity for a party of 6  *  Owner (or manager, whoever he was) barks at employees in front of guests  Save yourself the stress and eat at Sunset Pizza straight across Boulder Highway.  Their pizza kills Johnny Mac's."}
{"text":"What could possibly be better than pizza and wings to go with football? Nothing if you ask me. Johnny Mac's has been recommended to me by several people but its not really close to my house. I finally decided to drive over there and try them out.   I ordered a large Johnny Mac special and 1 lb of wings. Johnny sells wings by the pound, about 8-10 per order. I like that they make their own dough fresh every day and only buy fresh chicken wings. The order was just finished as I walked in. Johnny's looks like a great local bar with several TVs to watch sports.   First the wings. BEST I have had in the valley. The wings were perfectly cooked and sauced. They were crunchy and not over cooked, just perfect. Served with celery and blue cheese dressing it was a match made in heaven.   The pizza was also very good. I am really picky when it comes to crust and it was just a little too under done and \"doughy\" for me. The toppings and cheese were great though. They definately are not skimping on the toppings. If it was a little thinner or cooked a little longer it would have been excellent.   Overall Johnny Mac's was definately worth the drive. I will absolutely be returning for more of those wings!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!! Food and service are great,  love the remodel,  good atmosphere. I like that its non smoking.  Also, a good place to come for dinner,  watch some sports,  or bring the family."}
{"text":"Hell Yeah!  Finally went in for a burger and so glad I did!  It was huge!  Waitress was friendly and attentive but not always at the table.  I LOVE that the soda cups were huge and didn't constantly need a refill. Great food for an awesome price."}
{"text":"With restaurant.com coupon in hand I came here with friends for some pizza and wings.   I had my heart set on the watermelon sauce. We took a long time looking over the menu deciding what we wanted to order. Once our waitress came she dashed our hopes by not only letting us know they were out of the watermelon sauce, they were also out of chicken breast for the pasta we wanted.  Take two on ordering. We were disappointed but decided on the half rack of ribs, large pizza with meatballs and wings with garlic cilantro, bbq and lemon pepper.   The ribs were ok. The sauce was good but the meat was a little on the dry side. I enjoyed the cole slaw quite a bit. The pizza had good flavor and I enjoyed the meatballs, but the sauce was sweeter than I would have liked and the crust would have been better if it was a little more well done. The wing sauces were tasty, but the wings were a little overcooked for my taste.  Service was spot on. Our server was incredibly pleasant and she was so sweet and attentive.   I don't see myself going out of my way to try this place again, but it's decent if you're in the area. They advertise a pizza and wing buffet for $10 including a drink on Sunday which sounds like a great deal while you're watching the games."}
{"text":"This place is great. They recently remodeled and it is very nicely done. I always order the Henderson Special, which comes with 5 lbs of wings and a large one topping pizza. The wings are the best in town, crispy with great flavor. The pizza is top notch as well. Goes down great with a Labatt Blue. The service is always good and attentive as well. Can't go wrong with coming here."}
{"text":"Best wings and pizza. Ever... I wonder if they can ship us some from Henderson to Houston, Tx.... cool decor, full bar. If you're looking for good food and a good family friendly atmosphere this is the place to be."}
