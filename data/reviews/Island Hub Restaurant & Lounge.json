{"text":"Most excellent! Friendly service good prices great food and plenty of it.  I was planning my next trip here after the first bite.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to try this place, because being from South Florida I miss a lot of the ethnic foods I was so accustomed to.  Well, I was soon to be met with disappointment.  I ordered takeout on a Saturday night.  I ordered two dinners, jerk chicken and oxtails both had the same sides, peas and rice with plantains.  The jerk chicken was terrible, it was more like someone  stewed chicken in a vinegar sauce, this is certainly NOT how GOOD jerk chicken is suppose be prepared.  Next, the oxtails, they were really skimpy, it was more fat on them than meat. The portion size does not match the price of the meal,  two (2) thinly cut pieces of meat, completely surrounded by lots of fat. Lastly the sides, the taste and texture of the rice is not what I'm accustomed to with either Haitian or Jamaican food. The rice was undercooked and wasn't seasoned very well and the plantains were extremely mushy.  Believe me my family and I know good Island food, this just wasn't it.  With all the good reviews I was expecting better. All I can say is, buyer be ware...especially on Saturday night's and also if you're accustomed to GOOD island food.  Oh! Forgot to mention, I  didn't get to try their pikliz because they left it out of the order."}
{"text":"Love this place. Haven't been for a year, though!  Pikliz and griot are A1. I really wish they did the white rice with the pigeon peas on top more often. Does anyone know when they offer it?"}
{"text":"We went with some friends last night, excited for a neighborhood spot. We started out with the plaintains and Boy Howdy! I loved those things. Just the right amount of caramelizing. I got the Griot and thought it was just super! I really liked the sauce that came with it. The collards are really nice as well. My hubs got the croaker fish and loved his. A couple friends got the jerk and said that it was super spicy but still really good. The spicy slaw-like condiment is a POW! right in the face... but nice if you mix it in with your food. I had a little bite of it raw just to taste and... well, I got what I asked for.  I hear they have music on Fridays/Saturdays so I'm looking forward to checking that out sometime. The owner came out and was sociable - asking how things were. The only constructive criticism that I'd give is that bc it was a slow night the lady that cooks a handful of items on the menu wasn't working - so we would order and it wouldn't be available. It's a hard balance when you are first opening a restaurant, I'm sure, but may be good to have a mid-week menu or a \"the lady cook isn't here\" menu. Two of the orders were also messed up, but we all ate it and enjoyed what we got anyway. I'm sure the \"growing pains\" will work themselves out. The food is really good!"}
{"text":"1st & foremost the food was great!   I didn't know that I even liked Haitian food that much, but it turns out I'm a pretty big fan.  I'm happy this place got renovated and it's good to see the owners putting forth the effort to bring this to life!   It's a tricky balance to start a new place and balance staff/hiring with customers (or lack thereof) as you're getting started so I hope they succeed!  The inside particularly is really nice!  The outside is improved too- it could use some improvements like an awning or some renovating, but I know they're just starting out so I definitely am cutting them a lot of slack.  I'd probably take the bars off the windows or something too- it's not a bad neighborhood, and the impression they give probably negates any security they might offer.  Anyway, overall they whole experience was really very nice- the staff was kind, attentive, and helpful, the food was great and fairly priced, the place was well kept and clean, and I hope to dine there again soon."}
{"text":"FABULOUS!!! Just what Charlotte needed...a Haitian restaurant! The food was excellent! I had chicken which was perfectly seasoned. My husband had fried whole snapper, also well seasoned. The fried green plantains and rice and peas were awesome.  Adding a touch of picklies gives it that WOW! The atmosphere is very festive with a mix of Haitian and Jamaican music. No problem getting up to dance when the music hits you!  The restaurant is clean and just the right size. It's nice to hear Creole from both the customws AND wait staff. We WILL be back."}
{"text":"Don't let the reviews fool you.... Oh wait, the review are right!!! This place is the place in Charlotte for Haitian food. The other reviews are right though about  this place being on Haitian time. Lol. However, it is well worth it. It takes time to make these flavorful dishes. So don't expect to get it in 20 minutes.  Now I'm going to list my pros and cons as I usually do.  Pros:   Amazing food   Great staff   Great mixed drinks   It has Haitian food  Cons:   Takes awhile for your fresh food  I will definitely be coming back here. Need to see how their pate creole? tastes."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Island Hub Restaurant & Lounge located in Charlotte on Monroe Road a couple blocks from Independence Blvd and Wendover Road.  This Caribbean restaurant specializes in Haitian Cuisine including jerks, curries, and other island dishes.  Dora here. Don't let the rather plain outside deter you from giving Island Hub a try. The interior was nice and clean. But empty!?  Where is everybody? Granted this eatery just opened in March, but this place should be jammed! Maybe the lack of patrons has something to do with the neighborhood, which looked a bit...tired. Or it could be that Yelp indicated they open at 11:30 on Sunday, but the sign on the door showed noon. Oops. Whatever, they were accommodating and friendly by letting us in early. Thank you, Island Hub!   After living most of my life in Florida, I have tasted a wide variety of island foods prepared many different ways, so I was optimistic going into this restaurant. For my lunch, I chose my absolute favorite, Griot, fried pork chunks marinated with a seasoning blend along with sides of cabbage and collard greens. This dish was outstanding; the pork was well seasoned, fried to perfection and served with an equally good dipping sauce. The cabbage was great, cooked al dente, with just the right amount of bite and as a twist, included thinly sliced carrots. The collard greens were full of flavor and delish. This place is a gem that's waiting to be discovered. And we did.  Dora here. Somehow I knew Ernie wouldn't share his fried pork chunks. But take a look at that serving size! Sheesh, I only managed to snag a tiny bite.:) So I settled for the Curry Chicken, Mac & Cheese, and Fried Plantains. lol. Just kidding, no settling involved. With a bold, hearty flavor, the chicken curry teased my palate but didn't burn my mouth. The Mac & Cheese was just the right texture, firm and cheesy, and soooo good. Be aware, though, that the chicken comes on the bone. Doesn't this picture make you want some? Drooling again...  Giant portions, great value, and friendly service. Let's fill this place!  What's your spice level? Chicken, on bone or off bone?  We rate this restaurant 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"Great good. Unfortunately, per their Facebook page, this place is closed.   https://www.facebook.com/islandhub/"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. My sister and I both had the griot. I had the rice and beans with plaintains as my side. She had the white rice and black bean sauce with plaintains. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was good, not a lot of choices, no price difference for lunch and dinner. Food was good, but I don't know if would come back because of the B grade."}
{"text":"Looking for authentic food flavors from the islands? Look no further!!!  I ordered the curry chicken, red beans & rice with plantains. Awww..man!!! It was goood! The curry chicken had a nice spicy level and good amount of curry sauce. The red beans & rice was good! The plantains was pretty tasty too!"}
{"text":"First, the food is amazing! Authentic, bold and delicious, and the same can be said about the atmosphere. The staff is genuine and you feel welcome when you first walk through the door. Things I recommend are the conch, tilapia and the Jerk chicken. Only heads up....be prepared to stay for a bit and listen to some loud Caribbean music."}
{"text":"Have mercy this food was amazing im full but still want to eat more and i order more food for others to taste.......THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE."}
{"text":"All the reviews are spot on.  This place was great. Miss Ella knows how to treat her guests.  I tried Griot with rice & beans along with sweet plantains.  Everything was delicious.  We were informed that Thursdays is open mic night and Fridays is live music.  I'll definitely be back on a Friday."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken was amazing! And the staff was just as great. They had a fun band on Friday night. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely fantastic but it took about an hour and a half for an entire party of 15 to eat. Half of our table had finished eating by the time that the other ones were even served. I know the party was large but we called ahead and were assured that we would not overwhelm the kitchen, which we did. I can only give it 3 stars on strength of thr food alone, while the food with combined service would have at least been a 4.5. From now I will only be calling in for food until their chef comes back and they have patties, the mushrooms come from New York because they don't have them here and they work out the service kinks."}
{"text":"My grandmother brought us here because she was here a few nights ago with other family, and she absolutely loved it.  Today, Gabrielle provided great customer service.  The food was flavorful. We had oxtails with rice and beans, plantains and cabbage, stew chicken with the same sides mentioned above, and an order of curry chicken with rice and beans and collard greens. We all left full and happy. We will return soon."}
{"text":"I went here in the past week for my second visit...first time I got take out this time I sat and eat I ordered the oxtail it was very tasty and the plate presentation was very presentable however they give me 4 small pieces of oxtails and small portion of Mac and cheese and 4 plantations for almost 17 dollars which I think was ridiculous...not so much  the price but the portions...my waiter was a young lighter skin young man who was very disconnected I said thank you quit often when he did bring my food and refill my drinks and he never even responded with your welcome not once...he was more interested in rushing  back to his phone at the bar where he was sitting....he never really acknowledge that I was a paying customer I felt...I paid for my check when he brought it and he still never said anything...not thank you or nothing...never even came back just sat at the bar on his cell phone...since this is a family business I just expected a more kinder experience...since they are not the cheapest as well...also the customer service should have been more welcoming all and all the food was good but the portions and the customer service needs work:("}
{"text":"The food and customer service was amazing, really 5 stars but my daughter and I give this restaurant 4 stars because the menu could be more kid friendly (i.e. No kid menu or kid cups, high chairs but no booster seats) and also the timing of food delivery was off as our entrees came out at different times.  Great food though. Even the kids loved the food."}
{"text":"Wow, I was super skeptical of all the great reviews, but this place is legit!  Their service was on \"Island-time\", but the restaurant is nice and open and they have some nice jams for you to sway to, so it isn't so tough to just hang out. The servers are also VERY nice and accommodating.  I LOVED the black beans and rice, their green plantains and curry chicken. The conch was good, too, but not as easy for everyone to enjoy--I get it...It's a texture thing :)  Make sure to try their appetizer patties (they often sell out) and if you aren't *that* hungry you can share your dish with a friend since each entree gives you enough food to feed three people.   if you like extra spicy fare, make sure to ask for their spicy relish. It packs quite the punch and adds a great texture to the rice & beans. Please, for the love of all that is holy, do not desecrate this fare with American hot sauce.  I may opt for take-out if I am time-strapped, but I will DEFINITELY be back to Island Hub."}
{"text":"This place should be a staple in Charlotte. I've been here a few times and the food is always amazing. Its a sit down place but you can also take out. The service is a tad bit slow but the staff is nice and friendly. This is a great place to eat, I love it and you will too."}
{"text":"I got the griot, black beans and rice. It was was very tasty. Reminded me of when I lived in Miami. Good to see Charlotte is getting more diverse Caribbean restaurants."}
{"text":"We had dinner there tonight and pretty amazing and authentic Caribbean food.  I had Legumes and my friend had stewed chicken.  We both had really good sides- collards, plantains. The food is really good."}
{"text":"Nice place with really friendly folks. Food is great, huge portions and if you are not sure what you want they offer you little tries. Friday night live music. Everything for take out as well."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. That being said, the wait to get our food took almost an hour. We weren't really given an explanation as to why it was taking so long, other than a mix up in the tickets...the place is small and was not full. It would have been nice to have a manager or even the owner acknowledge the problem. They could've comped a meal or sent an appetizer to the table, something! My family was in the restaurant business and we would never let customers sit there and wonder what's going on.  Not sure if I'll dine in again, but may do take out. The food is very authentic and delicious...so I'm torn."}
{"text":"Absolutely delish!  Ordered the Jerk Chicken with cabbage and plantains as sides.  Loved every bite, my senses were going wild!  Also tried from my BFs plate the curry chicken with rice and beans and Mac/cheese.  Again, a great dish.  Would highly recommend.  My BF can't wait to go back for the ox tail!"}
{"text":"FINALLY FOUND AUTHENTIC Jerk Chicken with rice and beans and cabbage AMAZIN! HUGE portions good price more than worth it! Girlfriend had buffalo wings she loved them she tried my food and loved it which says a lot because her mom is Jamaican born and raised. This is our new spot food is like family dinner"}
{"text":"I recently learned above this restaurant and wanted to try it.I ordered my food by phone and went to pick it up.I paid for it and as I'm sitting at the bar waiting for it to come out,I came across their sanitation score.I was very disappointed as they were scored in the 80s.I went online and saw their previous score was higher,but I was still hesitant to eat my food.I ate a little bit of the food to taste,but threw the rest away.From what I tasted,I did not enjoy it.  Plus:Staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"Good things come to those who wait!  I went to Island today for lunch with a friend and sooooo glad we did!   We were in the area getting my car inspected and needed to find a tasty lunch nearby.... Yelp never lets me down and I found this jewel in the rough....literally. From the outside I was a bit thrown as there is construction and it's not super esthetic but again, Yelp never steers me wrong.  The inside is a bit cafeteria like but we were greeted by a sweet lady who sat us where we wanted.  After several minutes the server came over with some water.  He didn't seem super pleasant but after giving him my best hello, he greeted us and loosened up a bit....just a bit. At the server's recommendation I ordered Legume (beefy vegetable stew) with the white rice and beans and sweet plantains.  My friend had the Griot(fried pork) with white rice and beans and mixed veggies.     EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS!  The legume was perfectly seasoned and went well with the rice.  The beans were amazing too!  You can tell the cooking was authentic Haitian Creole cuisine.  I tasted the griot which was insane!  The pork was crispy on the outside juicy inside and seasoned to perfection!  It was topped with spicy pickled red onions similar to Jamaican escovitch.  I was in heaven with each bite! I did see Jamaican cuisine on the menu too which was a bit perplexing because you can tell the chef is Haitian.  Stick to that good stuff!  The wait for the food was long and the service could be friendlier but the food makes up for It!  DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! My husband had the fried goat and I had the curry chicken and they were both extremely good!! The staff is also very nice and welcoming! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The Haitian food was delicious! I had the griot, white rice and black bean sauce and a side of sweet plantains. The food was seasoned very well and close to matching my mother's cooking! Authentic Haitian food. The decor is modern and the service was great. They have live music on Fridays and Saturdays. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I'd give Island Hub 3.5 stars.  I really wanted to give it more.  I had stew chicken with beans and rice and collard greens.  The greens were very good.  Beans and rice were good although there was way too much of it on my plate.  They gave me two pieces of chicken.  One was good, the other tasted like it had been warmed over one too many times.  What I really didn't like was the sauce.  Just too oily.  My daughter ordered the same as me except she had mac n cheese instead of rice.  The mac n cheese was good.  But, her food was swimming in the oil from the sauce.  I think a lot of mine was absorbed by the rice.  The menu is limited.  My daughter likes BBQ chicken.  But, Island Hub had only three chicken dishes: Stewed, Curry and Jerk.    The building is non-descript.  The inside looks much better than the outside.  Looks like they have a small band on the weekends.  The service was good.  Maybe a tad slow.  But, the server and the cook were very friendly and accommodating.  Not sure that I'd go back to be honest.  I normally love stew chicken.  But, I can't over all of that oil."}
{"text":"Really good food, clean restaurant, great staff, and enjoyable setting. The food was traditional Haitian, which is hard to find in the VA/ NC area! My girlfriend is Haitian, and she had been looking for quality Haitian food for awhile now, and this is well worth the experience. Consider trying this if you are looking for something new, you will be pleased!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little spot! We just had take out and it was great. Jerk chicken that fell off the bone with a lot of flavor but not too spicy. White rice with black bean sauce was awesome! My husband had the pork.  You could tell it was sautéed first because it had a nice crispness, not over cooked and dry. Collards and plantains were both fantastic sides. Overall I can't wait to go back to dine in and listen to the Island music."}
{"text":"As much as I was excited about coming here, I was let down for a number of reasons:  1) The restaurant was almost empty. However, there were tables that still were not cleared. They had bits of food and dishes on them. I had to wait and stand by while this task was being done....not cool  2) The Jerk Chicken Wings really were not jerk-style at all....more like a stew-like  3) The bar seems to be limited and when you ask for a shot, they put ice in it...waters down my liquor and I don't like that...  4) The Griot included pieces of Fried Pork Shoulder. However, the pieces seems a little too overcooked. I had to add the accompanying sauce to soften them up. Mac and Cheese and collard greens were good, though.  5) But, the clincher is their sanitation score. I didn't research their score prior to going...once again, I was caught up in the excitement, right?...Well, I woke up this morning with a helious sore throat...went back through the Yelp reviews and seen where someone mention a B sanitation score...and sure enough, as of 7/21, it is 84.50...This will be my last time going here."}
{"text":"5 plussss Stars food is so good just like the hatian food I eat in New York ..... Soooooo gooooood I will keep driving 30 min to eat it. The griot is amazing the rice comes with sauce n plantains are crisp  .... I love this place better than every Caribbean place I have eaten since living in Charlotte the few months I've been here."}
{"text":"The food was EXCELLENT!!! Service was pretty fast though no one was in there. I had the jerk chicken which I buy at every Jamaican restaurant I go to. It wasn't spicy and had a vinager base that was perfect. My wife had the curry chicken that wasn't spicy as well. If you're looking for quality food, this is certainly the place to go."}
{"text":"I ordered my food togo. I had the fried goat dish & it was to die for. Very traditional & flavorful. I would definitely go back and highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who loves island food or if u just want to try something new."}
{"text":"First time here. Came in for take out. I was greeted by a very nice lady she offer me a seat and drink. I asked for water. She took my order quickly. I ordered curry chicken with 2 sides: rice/beans and Mac n cheese. I wanted a beef patty but they were sold out at 7pm for the rest of the night. I suggest get there early for patties because once they run out it won't be anymore. The food did take almost 20-30 minutes for me to receive my order. They were not full of customers there was only 1 table with a large family of kids but they were the only customers. Seems like it was only 2 waiters in the place. There were a few cooks in the kitchen I could see them walking pass the entrance.  I paid with my credit card and left it and the young man brought it to my car. Thanks so much!!!! I noticed the grade is a B. That's not good I expect all restaurants to be A. So I get home and dig in.  OMG the Mac n. Cheese has onions in it and I love it!!!! The rice with the curry sauce is so good and spicy, I love it. But the chicken to dry, tough and hard to get off the bone. Definitely need to marinate the chicken better next time. I will definitely come back and bring hubby but won't get the curry chicken."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. I ordered the griot with rice and beans, Mac and cheese, and cabbage to go (I was hungry). This was my first time trying griot, and it won't be my last. The staff was friendly and helpful even though I came in late. Next time I'll try the legume as recommended. Nice, down to earth place.   They may need to up their sanitation game. But having worked in restaurants for years, I know all it takes is a grumpy inspector on a rough Wednesday to get a lower score. I've seen points taken off for random things you wouldn't think twice about in a your home kitchen-- often issues with the building that the restaurant owner (who may lease the space) has little to no control over.  Or maybe they  were going to fix that (hypothetical) broken tile next week, who knows?  I know this place didn't look dirty--and I've seen dirty restaurants.  I have never worked in this kitchen so I can't say for sure. But my meal was fantastic, the service was above & beyond average, and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken in Charlotte, and an awesome band on Friday. Waiter was extremely helpful - good recommendations and my cup was never empty. We also tried the griot and it was amazing! Sweet plantains are a must."}
{"text":"First things first... Don't go to Island Hub if you're in a rush. In fact, don't go to Island Hub unless you have a solid 2-hours free. These folks are on island time and proud of it. As long as you're not in a hurry, the laid back pace of it all is pretty quirky and amusing. A nice departure from the rush to turn tables at just about every other restaurant in Charlotte. We were the only people in the restaurant for lunch on a Wednesday and spent just under 2-hours from start to finish.   I'm happy to report that the wait is worth every single minute as soon as the food hits your table. I had the jerk chicken with collard greens, rice & beans and tostones (green plantains). I could eat this plate of food for every single meal for the rest of my life and die fat, er, I mean happy. The jerk chicken was perfectly spicy and moist. They drizzled some of the jerk sauce on top of the rice and beans, which made those even tastier. The collard greens were cooked perfectly and had a little heat to them, too. Tostones came out piping hot and again, perfectly cooked -- I got 2 but could have eaten 1-million.    Head to Island Hub with an open mind (maybe you'll even order the goat!), don take tings so serious mon, and you'll be in for a treat. The small little issues -- slow service, no Diet Coke, food coming out in waves with the first few people getting their orders 15-minutes before the last few -- all seem like no big deal when you're staring down a big ol' plate of Caribbean goodness so clearly cooked with love."}
{"text":"Updated review: My most recent experience here was amazing! Marco provided EXCELLENT customer service, the food came out fairly quickly for a group of 5, & it was very delicious! I purchased my usual dish (the legume, white rice & bean sauce, with a side of Haitian style mac & cheese). This time around there was plenty of beef in the legume :-). I also enjoyed the Kompa music playing in he background. I highly recommend this restaurant for authentic Haitian food!"}
{"text":"The owner Contacted me and gave us a comp dinner for the confusion I will come again!! , must eat here , very good food , super service and beautiful people ,  please order the pork , it was to die for, the best I ever had , the drinks was refreshing but ugly cups , again eat here , the best food in the world maybe the universe"}
{"text":"Wow. This place was amazing. Authentic, delicious, Haitian food. We ordered griot with riz djon djon (black mushroom rice available on Sundays), legume, and lambi (conch). The food was bursting with flavor, and the portions were huge. The rice I could eat by itself, it was that good. It was cooked perfectly, and so flavorful. I'm not usually a big fan of griot, but my husband is. I had some, and it was delicious. It was tender, and full of flavor. The legume was sooo good.  The only recommendation I have is to put less cloves in the conch. The taste of it in the food was too strong, and not to mention, if you accidently eat one, you're in for a nasty surprise. It was still very good. Highly recommend. My whole family enjoyed. I may live 25 miles away, but already know, I will be here often."}
{"text":"I accidentally found this place  and was pleasantly surprised. I was there in  the middle  of the day  and there was no one there. When  the food came the portion was more than enough (curry chicken/rice and beans/ plantains ) and seasoned well. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place, you're missing out.  They serve the best Jerk Chicken and Curry Chicken that I have had since visiting the Caribbean.  The potions are gigantic."}
{"text":"I happen to see this place out running errands and didn't try it but always kept it in mind when my cravings hit. So boom I tried it and OMG was it worth it. The food was AMAZING oh yeah did I forget to mention A M A Z I N G! It was such a tough decision to choose from curry or jerk chicken since they are both my favorite. Jerk won this time! It was so worth it the sauce was nice and flavorful with a nice Haitian spice to it. I got mac&cheese and cabbage as my side. Both were really good and my fiancé got fried tilapia with mac&cheese and red beans and rice! Talking about knocking them outta the ballpark with that one!!! I almost ate his plate before mine. The staff was extremely helpful and nice. They give you nice size portions so we both had enough to home leftovers. They have a live band on Fridays with karaoke so it's pretty awesome. I'd recommend this place to anyone who loves Caribbean cuisines. Two thumbs up island hub!!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down food was good! This was my first time here. However, it was the longest wait in my history for food. My family and I walked in with no hostess to seat ourselves and find our own high chair waited 20 mins for someone to come greet us. After that it took 1.5 hours to get our food, I approached what seemed to be the owner and no real empathy. Just sorry and cut short, it was only than she explained after the ticket came out that she was the only one there but a man actually was there helping her too serve.  We had no drink refills and no extra napkins. Also, they were out of everything in appetizers. So, we were hungry for a long time. The food came out one at time for my family starting at 1.5 but all food finally was out at 2 hours. The whole experience took about 3.5 hours. It would been the best experience with good food and great service. Unfortunately, the great service was cut short. If the owner just express some empathy, would have been fine with everything."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food, service, and atmosphere. This is a keeper this is the 1st Haitian restaurant in Charlotte, go and experience the food, and culture. They also provide live music with a full bar."}
{"text":"I had the most incredible griot dinner tonight at what I believe may be the only Haitian restaurant in Charlotte. It is especially tasty when you add some of the pikliz to the pork chunks. Pikliz tastes a lot like kimchi so if your spice threshold is low, beware or take tiny bites. The owner was nice enough to write down the ingredients for me."}
