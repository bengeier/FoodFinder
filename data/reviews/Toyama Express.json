{"text":"Always a ton of food for the price! good for wanting a quick hibachi steak or chicken for like 6 bucks!"}
{"text":"We, specially my children, love the food at Toyama.  We eat there every week. We've tried different hibachi restaurants in south Charlotte and this restaurant is the best!  The people at the restaurant are very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Everyone is always so rude and the portions have decreased so much. I used to love coming here for the food, but the customer service is just horrible. I wish they were nicer and actually have reasonable portions. They lessened the portions by 75%!!!! Not sure if I will be back.."}
{"text":"Quick, cook to order, large portions, tasty. I stop here to take out after work. No need to call ahead as they make it so fast your order is ready before you can sit down and get comfy for your wait. The price is the best. $6 flat for teriyaki (or hibachi) chicken with rice, mushrooms and shrimp sauce. Eat in, on the patio or take with you. It's like made to order Japanese \"quick\" food. One of my favorites when I'm just too tired to cook. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Picked up some Hibachi Salmon from Toyama last night on my way home from work. It was a late night for me - luckily I got there before they closed. I love this place. It literally kept me going when I was in school at UNCC. The trick to ordering at Toyama is to call ahead. If you're just getting it to go; then, order as you're driving there, and tell them you'll be there in 5 minutes. They usually have your food ready upon arrival, and you can skip the line and pay at the pick-up register. Works for me every time."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Toyama on Mallard Creek. Great food, comes out fast and good prices.  I've ate here at least 8-9 months. As I was eating, I looked down at my chicken and it appeared to be a dead spider that was attached to a piece of the chicken. Needless to say I stopped eating it and took pictures......I guess eatinv here was fun while it lasted."}
{"text":"Delicious. I'm going back. Nice patio. Love the sound of he metal banging in the kitchen and the old Asian lady hollering at the cooks. Equal parts take out and quick dine in. Good stop en route to NoDa."}
{"text":"Hmmm yummy the service is always fast even if you order in to go.. And not to mention how wonderful the food is... Always greet w/ a smile.."}
{"text":"Awesome service, and you get a lot of food for what it costs, make sure you are hungry!"}
{"text":"I've been eating toyamas since I moved here TEN years ago. The staff that work the front registers are by far the rudest staff I've seen so far ... I love this restaurant,  I would give the food 10 stars if I could. But I dread even having to interact with the front staff at the registers... I even order to go to try and avoid the attitude and dirty looks, but tonight proved me wrong again. Still was treated with disrespect.. beware of the staff... if you guys take any of your reviews serious please consider this one and get some new staff that want to be kind to your customers. It really says a lot about the place on who they hire to be the faces you see right when you walk in... disappointed...."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and the food is always great!  Of all the Japanese restaurants I have tried this one is the best so far!  It's reasonably priced and really yummy!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard hibachi fare. Wife and I went to lunch had the number 12 food was better than the hibachi express in gaston county flavor wise. What was a real surprise was the speed of the service especially at high noon lunch rush! I'd go back again four stars because the food could be a little better."}
{"text":"Great food and fair lunch prices! $6 lunch isn't too expensive. They also offer take-out and a drive-through. I go here all the time, keep it up Toyama!"}
{"text":"So disappointed in their customer service. If you close at 9pm, lock your doors. Don't let a line of customers form only to tell them you are closed and send them away. Turning away customers is bad for business, isn't making money important?!...There are many hibachi restaurants in town, you're giving me a reason to choose them over you. Not to mention Thai Taste is right next door and stays open later! They got my money tonight. #unsatisfiedcustomer"}
{"text":"If you're looking for decent food and quick service, this is the place! The drive thru window is possibly the best thing that a Japanese restaurant could have. For the price, the quality and quantity of good is unbeatable!"}
{"text":"I am a student at UNCC and I am pretty sure every student at that school knows about Toyama. It is cheap and delicious. Everything on the entire menu is good and I could probably eat it everyday. It is your basic Japanese Express restaurant but everything is done well and very fast. Hibachi chicken and steak, teryaki chicken and steak, shrimp, and salmon are among the combination plates to choose from. All combination plates come with rice, carrots and another vegetable depending upon what meat you choose and of course, shrimp sauce. You can substitute zucchini and onions for the carrots if you wish. The sauteed mushrooms are a personal favorite of mine. The appetizers are also very good specifically, the egg rolls and tempura plate. They have outdoor seating as well which I really love. I definitely recommend Toyama for some quick and delicious Japanese food."}
{"text":"Fast service and the food is consistent.  Great fast Japanese food.  My favorite is the teriyaki steak."}
{"text":"Crappy service. Hair in the food. Unprofessional. Always flies in the restaurant. I stopped going."}
{"text":"Fast and good hibachi, nothing fancy but great for the price you pay. My go to place for hibachi take out."}
{"text":"I use to come here every so often when I use to work on this side of town. This place is quick, tasty and affordable. The appetizer wings are cooked just right and I had most of there bowels which also were great. I have not been disappointed so far and I will continue to come and dine at this location."}
{"text":"Food is pretty much always hot and good. Now the workers are a little special. There's a new college student behind the register seems like every week and can get your order all screwed up OR give you attitude. Not the most professional but the food is definitely worth overlooking that."}
{"text":"Huge portions and excellent prices. Quick service. Great hibachi and teriyaki plates."}
{"text":"Good for a good price. The teriyaki salmon is my favorite. I'm not a huge fan of the hibachi shrimp."}
{"text":"I went one time with my friend and there was something wrong with my order then they refund us right away really good service and good food"}
{"text":"This is my staple takeout spot. When im hungry and dont feel like cooking this is where I go. The staff is great and I appreciate they hire a diverse group of people. They are always courteous and friendly. It is usually pretty crowded but the wait time is  acceptable based on their patronage.  I can tell they work hard at getting your order to you in a speedy manner. way better that your traditional Chinese food. I usually order the hibachi jumbo shrimp and chicken with noodles i order the sweet carrots on the side. I dont like the taste of the carrots mixed with the food. Its delish and reasonably priced and well portioned. Definitely get your moneys worth here!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here often so much so most of the employees know who I am based on my \"complicated\" order, haha. The food is always great and the prices are reasonable. Great customer service as well"}
{"text":"Yummy food and super cheap. I got the veggie entree and the miso soup  both delicious and a fair amount of sauce"}
{"text":"Great quick takeout Hibachi! Fairly good prices and a good amount of food is served. The service is usually very good around lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place. I think this is one of the best Japanese food in the university area. It always fast and the price for food is awesome! But if you want to go in for a quite and peaceful lunch/dinner this is not the place to go. It's some what loud and you will hear the owner yell out orders. And sometimes the cashiers do not look very happy to be there and can give you an attitude. But everything else is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I spoke so highly of this place just to be disappointed. I'm not sure what was going on or why my food came out extremely fast but when I bit into an ice cold mushroom, I understood why. My sister ate her cold broccoli but I sent mine back. They threw my food on the stove, drowned it in sauce and gave it back to me. How do I know? Because the piece I bit off of was still on the plate. So I asked for a fresh one with cooked vegetables, now I have no vegetables at all. Smh it'll be almost FOREVER before I come back here smh."}
{"text":"Poor customer service from management. I've eaten at this place quite a few times in the past. Tonight I ordered shrimp hibachi and I get home (15 minutes away) to steak and mushrooms. It's partially my fault, because I should not have trusted that my order would've been correct. I get all the way home, ready to sit down and enjoy my dinner only to realize it wasn't what I ordered.  I drive all the way back only for the manager to nonchalantly ask if I wanted another order of what I originally ordered. There was no \"we apologize for messing up your order\", \"sorry for any inconvenience we've caused\"...Nothing! At that point I asked for a refund and that was that. I'll save my hard earned coins for a more deserving, customer friendly establishment."}
{"text":"Toyama is a fantastic, fast Japanese food. The service is fast and the food is tasty and filling. The price is hard to beat (two full meals for around $17) I'm so glad the town of Matthews has Japanese food amongst it's restaurants. It's a great lunch or dinner option. Definitely eat here!"}
{"text":"They cook their rice perfectly, portion sizes are great.  Prices are very reasonable.  Service is shockingly fast.  They get everything right in fast casual dining."}
{"text":"Great food! I always get the teriyaki chicken with broccoli. You can tell they use fresh vegetables and they give you a huge portion."}
{"text":"If I was still at UNCC living on a college kid budget I might give this place 5 stars, but I'm not.  The food is ok.  $6 something for chicken and mushrooms hibachi ain't bad, but they don't really cook their mushrooms very much(even your basic button mushroom shouldn't be eaten raw).  I'll be back as I'm a sucker for cheap \"asian\" food, but I'll still probably complain about something."}
{"text":"I've eaten here over 200 times and have only been disappointed once or twice. I think that's worthy of 5 stars!

Very fast service. Generous portions. Cheap sodas and tea. 

My favorite budget restaurant!"}
{"text":"Toyama is hibachi fast food. Its not special or fancy but consistent every time.  I have been coming here for 8 years and it is always crowded.  Inexpensive and can be fairly healthy if you are on a diet. Just get double veggies instead of fries rice and skip the shrimp  sauce."}
{"text":"Toyama Express is really good. I have been here a few times now for lunch. It is essentially a walk-up counter and then they bring your good to your table. There is a huge lunch rush about noon so be prepared. The food still came out fast.

I get the steak and scallops. The meat is very tender and cooked perfectly. The orange sauce on the side was excellent for dipping the meat and seafood. I also mixed it in with my rice. It is great quality and I would expect to pay more than they charge!!  It would be a good place to bring your kids as well. It is very low key."}
{"text":"Toyama Express is really good. I came here for lunch a couple of days ago with a client. It is essentially a walk-up counter and then they bring your good to your table. There is a huge lunch rush about noon so be prepared. The food still came out fast.

I got the steak and scallops. The meat was very tender and cooked perfectly. The orange sauce on the side was excellent for dipping the meat and seafood. I also mixed it in with my rice. The service was excellent. Patio seating was pleasant. Excellent value for the price. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Tonight my husband and I took an out of town friend, Sam, to Toyama, and had the most bizarre experience... Sam's order was brought out to her with a side of spring rolls, and without the carrots that usually accompany it. The restaurant was fairly busy and there was a line, so we shrugged it off, and ate one of the spring rolls. 

About fifteen minutes later, a server came out and berated us for not returning the spring rolls to the kitchen. Sam explained that she hadn't been there before and didn't know the spring rolls weren't included with her meal; the server repeatedly insisted that we pay for the spring rolls she hadn't ordered. We refused. The server then snatched up the remaining spring roll (with a bite missing) and stormed off. 

But she wasn't done with us yet! The same server returned soon after to continue bullying Sam to pay for the spring rolls. Again Sam refused and asked to speak to a manager (conveniently not in tonight.) The server scolded that because of our \"dishonesty,\" another angry customer inside had not received their order. 

Choosing not to comment on the fact that we were not responsible for the kitchen correctly filling other customers' orders, I reminded the server that even if Sam returned the spring rolls, it would not have been food safe for them to serve the food she had touched to someone else. To the amusement of the other diners around us, the server continued to argue her point, ending by saying that \"next time\" we should do the honest thing and return the food that had been mistakenly brought to us. 

There won't be a next time after the incredibly strange, rude way we were treated. It's a shame; we like the food and have gone to Toyama fairly often -- but there are plenty of other restaurants in town that will not harass their customers for a mistake made by the kitchen. 

P.S. Two spring rolls cost $2.60."}
{"text":"Food is incredible. Very fast. Busy at lunch but go in between rushes are your food is so fast to come out. Everyone is so kind and I will continue to go here in the future. Highly recommend to anyone and everyone who loves japanese food!! And you get soooo much food!"}
{"text":"Affordable prices, quick service, decent options and average flavor. It was just okay, ginger sauce is super watery.  Liked that the rice was al dente and carrots were not too sweet.  The broccoli looked close to spoiled and they used anyway.  Would not make a special trip here."}
{"text":"Just left about 20 minutes ago. My first time there. I waked in and was immediately greeted by the cashier where I placed my order. I was impressed because I had heard there is usually a line. I decided on the chicken and shrimp combination plate with broccoli, mushrooms, and carrots.  A few minutes minutes later my order was ready and I went home. Got home, sat down at the table, opened my styrofoam box ready to dig in and on the lid was a piece of hair. HAIR IN MY HIBACHI BOX! I immediately called the restaurant. Girl answered and I was told to hold. I held on the line while she took order after order. I was on hold for about 10 minutes. The girl never returned to the phone. Tried calling back several times phone just rang and rang or I received the busy signal. I'm pissed I wasted my hard earned $11. I will NEVER be back and I will be sure to tell everyone I know about my experience tonight. The customer service was horrible and the cleanliness doesn't seem to be there either."}
{"text":"This little place seems to be very popular as it's always busy and full during lunch and dinner hours. Atmosphere wise it's definitely more of a place you would go to for the food, not the setting. It's always clean and it's not really that loud, but interior design wise it's very simple. Which isn't a bad thing if you're just looking to go in for a quick meal (and the food really does come out super quick) but I wouldn't go there for date night or a night out with friends.

Food is good and the dish sizes are big so I always end up leaving with a box of leftovers.  Price is right too and they also have a counter for take out customers. Most of the people working there are nice but I have had a couple of instances where I've soon regretted tipping them (you tip them before you get the food while ordering the food at the counter). There's one lady who comes off as grumpy and whenever she serves me it rubs off on me too..but that could also be the language barrier between us, as she doesn't seem to speak english very well.. But I go there for the food, so that hasn't bothered me enought to stop me from going back there.

My favorite dish is hibachi shrimp with broccoli. The hubby likes their hibachi steak with mushrooms."}
{"text":"Great fast, affordable hibachi place. The food is delicious and nice sized portions. Hibachi entrees include rice and carrots. Fast delivery through DoorDash."}
{"text":"I'm here almost weekly. Not sure why I've only checked in once. The food is great and consistent. I hate when I go to a place and it changes on me (portion size, taste, etc.) but not Toyama. I've been trying to stay away from carbs, because if no one has told you--they are the DEVIL! So I usually order the salmon with broccoli and carrots, no rice. Or shrimp with broccoli and carrots, no rice. Or anything...without the rice. The service is quick and it's on my way home from the gym."}
{"text":"Good place to get express hibachi. Limited parking near front door. Indoor and outdoor seating. Always busy location so it seems to be a popular spot."}
{"text":"My favorite Japanese place in the UNCC area.  Very quick, nice people and the food is good for the price."}
{"text":"Tried this place as a result of many glowing Yelp reviews.  Somewhat disappointed as my food was much too salty for my taste.  Ordering process was fast and efficient; food came out quickly.  Good value.  Ample seating indoors and out.  Shrimp dish has plenty of shrimp, quite healthful if it weren't for way too much salt.  But I'd still rather eat here than at a a faceless chain restaurant with stamped out food."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! I  had the hibachi with white rice and a delicious creamy sauce. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Amazing hibachi food right by my house.. what more can I ask for? I would only recommend the shrimp or chicken, as I think the steak seems a bit lower in quality. Always large portion sizes and they're very generous with the amount of yum yum sauce they give. Prices are reasonable. ($7 per entree) 

It almost never takes long to get the food - I feel like average is about 10 minutes. 

Wish they had more seating space!"}
{"text":"It helps when a place sticks to what it does well, and Toyama is such a place.  Being at the entrance to my subdivision, my wife and I find ourselves here often, either for eat-in or take out.  For us, their basic formula of Rice + Carots + Veggie + Meat + Sauce = Good.   I like the Hibachi Steak & Mushrooms, but the Brocolli dish is also very good.

If you come away hungry, its because you didn't finish your meal.  I like that we can eat inside or outside in a very relaxed atmosphere, and the fact that next door is a place we can get food for our children who haven't grown to appreciate Toyama's fare yet..."}
{"text":"Very fast service and the food is excellent. Cashier was friendly and provided good customer service"}
{"text":"I've been a long time toyama express customer/employee!.  I've been here when the restaurant was first open and yet i still come here! This place is hands down one of the best fast habachi places i've been to.  Here are a couple of reasons

1) You get quite a lot of food for the amount of money you pay! ( I have yet to finish a whole plate of food)
2) The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get.
3) One of the best tasting quick habachi places
4) A lot of variety.  

There isn't much to say about this place that i haven't already listed out.  I'd come here all the time if i still lived in Charlotte

TIP: You can pretty much swap out your vegetables and carrots for other veggies."}
{"text":"Great service! The two cashiers that helped us were friendly and speedy. The food has always been great but the drive this time was memorable!"}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant about half a dozen times. Each time, service was prompt and the food was slightly above average for a place that only takes about 2 minutes to prep it. However, on my most recent visit, I went through the drive-thru and had to wait about 10 minutes for my food to be cooked. When I got home, I found out that I did not receive the chicken teriyaki I ordered, but instead got chicken wings. I called and told them I was coming back and that I was given the wrong food.

When I got to the restaurant, the manager woman said that the cashier (a young teenager) was to blame. Awkwardly, she scolded the girl right in front of me. I felt bad, and I told her I understood that mistakes happen. The manager then proceeded to tell me that the difference in price between what the cashier rang up (the wings) and what I wanted (the teriyaki) was $0.48. She then asked me how I wanted to pay the difference.  

I was taken aback. You want ME to pay for your mistake. I had to drive back and waste time and gas and now I was being asked to pay the additional money? I didn't want the teenage cashier to lose her job over such a small mistake, so I took out a $1 bill and placed it on the counter and said \"keep the change.\" The manger proceeded to tell me again that it was the cashier's fault. 

I have no plans to return to a place that would mistreat their customers in such a manner. I hope a friendlier hibachi restaurant opens in Toyama's place."}
{"text":"My fiance and I order food here every Friday, it is our favorite. The shrimp sauce is awesome and the food is delicious. We usually order the hibachi steak. Big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"First time here and happened upon it by chance when work brought me around here. It is fairly good ad has a good price. The chicken is a bit to salty for my liking but it is defiantly a norm for this area. The employees were nice but the dining room tables could be wiped down a little more."}
{"text":"Lots of food for about $8 per person.  I usually get the steak with broccoli and hubby gets the steak with mushrooms.

This place is kicken.  Parking is plentiful but often nearly full.  Tons of people here on lunch break.

Clean but not super clean.  They bring your food to you or you can carry out.  Fast fresh."}
{"text":"Their service is SO HORRIBLE that you will literally walk inside and think you are on a prank tv show. No food is worth receiving such AWFUL customer service. 
Employees are Blatantly rude and unprofessional. 
I called in an order and the lady on the phone kept cutting me off and rushing me. I should have just cancelled then, but it gets worse...

I go in to pick up the food in hopes that they were not really rude and the lady who answered was just busy. NOT! I go in and get treated like dirt by another employee who was a male. I approach the register and he ONLY raises his eyebrows in a \"well..????? what do you want\" manner rather than saying \"hello, how are you ? What is the name on your order\". 
I tell this guy I'm picking up my order and give my name and then he throws his hands up at me and gives me big eyes as if he needed more than my name but he refused to open his mouth and say so.   

I'm just genuinely confused about how this place has so many positive reviews with such horrendous service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend goes here on his lunch break and so I finally went with him for dinner one night. Food is LARGE. Everything is good. Shrimp sauce is amazing. It was $15 per person but we order extra stuff (extra veggies for me and extra shrimp for him). I honestly can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love their shrimp sauce. Used to live near the N. Charlotte location & went frequently, moved away and ended up working in Matthews so glad I found this one. Food is just as good - cheap, fast & delicious. If I had a complaint, it would only be that the rice seems inconsistent - some days cooked perfectly, other days it seems rushed. 

Great for a quick lunch, though - the hibachi steak is simply wonderful."}
{"text":"Easy, quick, accurate, nothing more nothing less.  Happy to have a healthy food option nearby."}
{"text":"Great spot. Must say I'm a creature of habit and always get the chicken and mushroom hibachi. But every time is delicious. For the amount of food they give you the price is perfect as well. The only complaint I can think of is that the rice is never quite right when I visit. As if it's always just completely undercooked, but outside of that its perfect. The generous portions and the quality of of the food for the price make this spot unbeatable.
 I usually find myself here once a week or so. Location is great as well, right between the University and Northlake areas."}
{"text":"It's a great place to catch lunch. Always good and always tasty. Pretty good price too.

The only downside, if there is one, is the ventilation is not right in the building and you walk out smelling like the grill. They need to install an inlet in the overhead to allow air in for the exhaust fan."}
{"text":"The hibachi food here is delicious and the staff is really friendly. The sitting areas and fountain are very clean and organized. Good for hanging out with friends or a date. The only complaint I have is that the rice can be a hit or miss some days. Do not get me wrong, this is my favorite sit down go to Japanese in the area."}
{"text":"Favorite quick Japanese in Charlotte!!! Everything is excellent and at a GREAT price. Definitely give it a shot but don't expect it to taste like Nakato or other expensive Hibachi style restaurants. It is after all very quick and very inexpensive."}
{"text":"As other yelpers stated, great place for a quick, cheap (and surprisingly tasty) lunch. It's a sit down/take out (counter order) spot, known for their hibachi. The sweet carrots are a great compliment and don't forget the yum yum sauce  (pink shrimp sauce). The portions are huge and there will surely be leftovers.

Quick enough for a lunch hour run."}
{"text":"For once I wanted to have lunch at the same time as everyone else and Thai Taste was just packed. This placed just opened up around the corner and I decided to give it a try. I ordered a miso soup and the sauteed veggies with rice. 

Service was very good and quick and the miso soup was ok  but beyond that it just ... sucked. Tasteless rice and boiled carrots accompanied greens sauteed in miso. I was hungry but I couldn't eat it most of the plate, it was like hospital food. 

Since the miso soup ($1.80) is not included and most dishes are $8 to $11 it's not only tasteless food but an expensive lunch as well. Just what the neighborhood needed, another boring American-Japanese cafeteria."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best express Asian restaurant around. Extremely fast service. The food is always tasty. My order is accurate every time, even with menu modifications and the people are friendly. And it's basically like buying two meals in one. There's so much food. I always get the hibachi chicken and sub broccoli for the mushrooms. It's $6.92 and I can never finish. The next day I throw the leftovers in a container, add in some frozen mixed veggies and it's the perfect no-hassle meal for lunch."}
{"text":"I paid extra for nothing special. They got my order wrong. I paid an extra 4 bucks, came back to work to figure out they didn't give me the shrimp I ordered with my hibachi chicken. First and last time I'm coming here. On top of that, they gave me ginger sauce instead of shirmp sauce? Anyways, I was weary on coming here in the first place and now I have something to go on.

I want my 4 bucks back!"}
{"text":"Quick easy and more healthy than some of the other nearby options. A great place to stop in for some hibachi during your lunch break."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and super fast service at a price you're not going to beat. The hibachi chicken and steak are both wonderful."}
{"text":"I happened to stop here after my daughter had a dentist appointment on the recommendation of the dentist office staff.  The food is just your average quick Japanese style grill.   Nothing special.   The portions were nice, the staff friendly and the food came out ultra quick.  There is a nice outdoor patio that is enjoyable for people watching."}
{"text":"Great for express japanese food! I've never dined in, but take out service is always quick, fresh, and inexpensive. For around $6 I usually get the hibachi chicken with broccoli and rice. Add a drink for only .79! The staff is friendly and they seem to remember familiar faces which keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Yelp!  The fella's office moved up to University area, so I joined him for lunch on a Wednesday.  Neither of us had ever explored the neighborhood, so I checked Yelp for a recommendation, and you guys didn't steer me wrong!

We got there around 11:30 to beat the rush, but the staff seemed like a well-oiled machine and things were moving along swimmingly at noon when they got really busy.  The seating area is much bigger than I'd expected, including a covered patio in front, and there's a TV so you can catch up on the latest headlines.  

You order at the counter, and I appreciate that there are about 20 express meals you can pick from.  I tried the chicken with broccoli, and the fella tried the steak with broccoli; throw in two waters, and we both got huge, delicious portions complete with shrimp sauce for $13.40.  A woman brought out our order, and they clean up after you, too.  

The fella said this would definitely make the lunch rotation - it's cheap, tasty, and fast without making you feel rushed."}
{"text":"What business still has busy signals?  If you can't afford multiple lines or call waiting you don't need a food business.  Food is good but come on...."}
{"text":"Quick Japanese places have popped up everywhere. Toyama is a good one. You can get Terriyaki style or hibachi Style. The prices are cheap, but they skimp a little to keep the cost down. For example, the Hibachi Chicken is about $6. But, it only comes cooked with mushrooms and rice, and a few sweet carrots. If you want any other veggies- like onions, zucchini, or broccoli- it is extra. (A side of Onions and Zucchini runs about $2.50). It should be noted that this place is cook to order, so you don't get the dried out, pre-cooked chicken that is sadly commonplace at many stores in this type of concept. 

Super fast service, very clean, very casual. This is not a \"night-out\" Japanese place. But, this is a quick service, reasonably priced restaurant. with good food."}
{"text":"Teryaki Plate is my favorite. I used to love this place until...what I saw. I cannot believe what I saw. An employee goes in the restroom and uses the stall as I am washing my hands. He literally finished using the stall and went back INTO THE KITCHEN without washing his HANDS. ITS 2018 MAN. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. No way I am every going back there. I don't care how good there food tastes."}
{"text":"I have been a regular for years. I was there last week and have realized their quality has been declining. The proportion is dwindling as price goes up. However, still same amount of salt and grease. Toyama, you guys need to step up your game."}
{"text":"Used to be one of our go-to after class lunch trips during undergrad at Charlotte.  Great teriyaki chicken, and was always dirt cheap.  They opened a second location in Matthews but never took off, dunno why but even to me the Matthews location just was different and food was not quite as good as University spot.  I'm sure its all mental but I do love the food at the university location."}
{"text":"Drove pass here and it's always busy with people. I wanted to eat Japenese for my birthday and Nakato & Tsunami was a bit expensive for my family and I didn't need the sit down entertainment. 
Oh my I was impress with THE Whole Plate of food. Lots of food on my plate for less money a+++
1. Large food portion + yummy rice 
2. $ less expensive then the other take out u get
3. Food on point, steak was tender, carrots sweet, veggies were cooked crunchy still, scallops & shrimp were fresh & yummy. 
4. I know u like the shrimp sauce & yes it's Good!
5. Service was fast and my plate was tasty & hot!"}
{"text":"The food was sooooooo good!
Out was reasonably priced.
There is outside seating, with covering.
The customer service was good.
I'd definitely eat here again if ever in the area."}
{"text":"Neighborhood favorite in the University City-Arbor Creek area. All I've ever ordered from here is Hibachi shrimp with broccoli and carrrots. I use to frequent this place a lot while in college because the prices were reasonable. To my knowledge they do not deliver, but the service is REALLY fast. The staff has also always been friendly throughout the years. If you work in the area ( like at Wells Fargo, etc) , you may want to call ahead at lunch because the line is usually out the door , but service is still fast ."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Not upscale or anything fancy. Just good food, big portions at a great price."}
{"text":"Terrible. Flavor is not there. Fast food - Japanese food with no flavor. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, delicious, and always friendly staff!  The food is always hot and fresh and from what I've read fairly healthy for you (minus the awesome shrimp sauce). Great place to grab take-out or even sit down for a quick meal..."}
{"text":"You know that local eatery that is your \"go to\" for food that is quick, pretty cheap, and pretty yummy?  That place that you swing through for take out on a busy weeknight, or stop for lunch when you are out running errands?  Toyama is that place for us.  Our standard order is the hibachi chicken or steak (some of us sub the mushrooms out for broccoli).  To me, the sweet carrots are TOO sweet, and I sub broccoli for that, but the kids love them.  Go easy on the shrimp sauce, as it is super high fat/cal, but it is yummy for sure.  Wasn't as fond of the noodles, but I think I have only gotten them once out of the dozens of dishes I have ordered there, so it also could have been an anomaly.  I usually call first (as do many people) and they have our take out order ready and bagged up, and a special line to check you out.  Appreciate that a lot!"}
{"text":"This place is simply a steal. For the quality of food and the amount of food they give you, you seriously cannot beat it. My friend and I go here weekend and get the teriyaki chicken with fried rice and carrots. This place never disappoints and is never questionable like some of the other fast food Japanese/Chinese restaurants. It is very apparent that they use better quality meats than any of their competitors and the value truly cannot be matched. I recommend this place to so many people in the University area and they all rave about how great it was. I'll definitely be keeping up with this weekly tradition."}
{"text":"This is one of the better hibachi places in the area. I didn't feel like my food was overly greasy, overly salty, or that my vegetables were old, which is the problem I have with most joints like this. Went in with my hubby and he got the hibachi chicken for a whopping  $6! So much food he could barely finish it. I got the shrimp and steak with noodles for about $11. Super fast service too! Both entrees were pretty good, nothing that I would go outta my way to drive for but it is a GREAT spot for someone who lives in the area like me. All in all, it's an awesome alternative for nights I'm too lazy to cook dinner and want a change from Chinese take-out."}
{"text":"Like many said, the cashier wasn't friendly. Didn't do anything rude per se but didn't make you feel welcomed either. The food was actually really good, the portions were smaller than I expected compared to other habachi places I've been to.
But lord Jesus I didn't get 10 min down the road without having to find a bathroom for a #2 emergency. Felt fine afterward but that didn't last long!"}
{"text":"a staple for the poor college student looking to dine on some yummy hibachi. pour on the shrimp sauce and call it a success of a meal"}
{"text":"Nice lil spot for quick plentiful hibachi style dining!!!

We both had shrimp  n scallop with fried rice and mixed veggies- the carrots were so sweet n just the right touch to all the savory happening on our plate. 

It's very affordable at $11.99 for our meals and very generous portions. 

They have some patio dining and we enjoyed that our first time here. People constantly coming and going so they have a strong carry out game!!!!!

This is a great option for quick, inexpensive generous tasty food!  

I ate it so fast I didn't even get a pic"}
{"text":"Good hibachi takeout. I usually get the hibachi noodles with either steak or shrimp. Food is pretty good but my biggest complaint is they sometimes only give you very few pieces of steak/shrimp."}
{"text":"WARNING! My fiance and I both ate the same thing from here and now were both up in the middle of the night with FOOD POISONING. I plan on filing a report tomorrow. My stomach hasnt hurt this badly since my appendix ruptured. Im livid, were both supposed to work tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"PLEASE PLEASE Toyama don't start skimping and slacking, I ordered Shrimp Hibachi and the Salmon hibachi to go. HARDLY any CARROTS I'm talking 5 to be exact! My salmon was overcooked and my broccoli was scorched. For over a year now I have frequented this restaurant and have been pleased for the most part but the last few months have been disappointing. The portion sizes have decreased which is really sad and part of my reason for going back in the first place. I will have to take a break because I am running into disappointment with this place on each visit. What a bummer"}
{"text":"The food was very good I got the shrimp  and scallops mushrooms and the carrots and rice and yummy sauce .  it was very tasty and cooked well.  My hubby got the chicken and rice with onions . Hot fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"I've been going to Toyama for 6-7 years now. Used to go weekly when I lived closer. For the price and service it can't be beat. 
Around $6 for a typical standard dinner and ready within 2-3 minutes. 
Shrimp sauce is the best of any Japanese restaurant I've found. Sweet but not too heavy. Always have more food than I can finish. Not much has changed over the years, that's probably why I still stop in if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Whoever writes a bad review from here is simply impatient or simply one of those people who try to find a way to complain. I've been coming here for years. It's a busy busy place. The food comes out correctly 98% of the time. There has been a few times where I got carrots, oh no. Sure the people aren't all smiling being super fake at the cash register (which I like). They are there to get you what you want as quick as they can get it to you. The 2 lbs of food you receive seems like enough for me. This place has my business and will continue to as long as they keep being themselves."}
{"text":"So fast!  By the time you get your drink and sit down, the food is in your face!  I actually used to go here a lot since it's really quick and easy to grab lunch.  Staff is really nice and the portions are gi-normous.

My usual is the Hibachi Chicken & Mushroom.  With a cup of water the total comes out to $6 even.  Can't beat that for lunch.

The only drawback is the potential food coma you go into during the afternoons in the office.  Not good if you are trying to be productive or have a deadline to meet that afternoon.  LOL."}
{"text":"Good and fast!!!! OrderedShrimp and chicken Hibachi....great portion size!!! I'll be back to try more!!!"}
{"text":"Its just great for food and price. If they had sushi it would be six stars."}
{"text":"It seems like I come out of my way to stop in just to get some teriyaki chicken and broccoli lol! The food here is always fresh and prepared quickly. This is a good place to come and grab lunch on the go or to simply take back home. You get plenty of food for your money and I must say Toyama's is in a convenient spot! Pass up the burger joint next door and step into Toyama's! Don't forget to get some sweet tea to go along with your order!"}
{"text":"I had to take away one star because of an incident calling in an order.  I double checked my phone records and I called the correct location.  I called and put in an order to pickup and when I got there they never heard of me.  Assuming the name was mangled I asked if they had the contents of my order, possibly under another name.  Nothing.  No remorse, trip wasted.  I only took away one star because this only happened once, but I only ever did to-go once.  I will give them another chance.

Choose your meat and choose your vegetable.  That is how great this place is.

They give you plenty of shrimp sauce (glorified mayonnaise sauce) and plenty of food.  I usually don't care for cooked carrots but this place does them well enough that I enjoy them.

I usually get mushrooms or broccoli with beef.  I wish they had more onions in there (either mixed in the fried rice or with your meat).  I haven't asked for extra onions yet so that may be on me.

This place is a good size but don't expect to always get a seat during the lunch rush.  It gets crowded and you may end up eating in your car.  No matter how busy it gets they manage to knock out the food faster than people leave their seats.

This is really a place for locals - it isn't something I would drive across town for.  It is good but you can probably find something closer if you need to.  They just do an excellent job on a very simple concept."}
{"text":"We used to eat here lots but moved. Having said that, we still eat here as often as possible.

Their food is usually spot on but I've had at least one meal that wasn't up to par. The rice was kind of old which is the base of the meals. 

But one out of many visits isn't bad so we keep going.

Just as good as Ishi without the Ishi mark up = good eats.

Good for small groups (4-6) but usually crowded at the lunch rush."}
{"text":"I love this place. I swear i eat here at least once a week. Smh. I could not wait to move back from California to Charlotte just for this shrimp sauce. I could not find it at any hibachi place in Los Angeles. No one even knew what i was talking about when i said shrimp sauce or yum yum sauce. It was horrible. So Im super excited to be back and able to eat at this place a couple times a month."}
{"text":"Really good fast food option for hibachi. You get lots of food for a great value. The sweet carrots and fish sauce are two signature items that they offer. Service is quick and they do offer a quick service dine in option."}
{"text":"It's good for take out! Pleasant crew and order was ready in 10 min. Just $13. I wanted more flavor with the meal but I can't help but to compare it to Yamatos or Kabutos 

I'll re-order just not for a while."}
{"text":"This place is crumbling into food disaster. Honestly, I've really enjoyed this place before. I usually order the salmon rice and it was definitely my favorite but for some reason the few times I've recently been to this place, it was disappointment after disappointment. The salmon suddenly has an obvious freezer burn taste to it and the rice is just ridiculous. I've had rice there that was just dry but that's not all.. I've had rice that wasn't even completely cooked!! A lot of people come into this place because it's cheap with great portions and I am guilty of that also but I'm not so fond of the great portions if it's not edible."}
{"text":"I ordered the hibachi chicken with mushrooms and was very disappointed.  The chicken was dry and tough, mushrooms were not fully cooked, and the rice was just ok.  I did like the sauce though.  Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"ummmm no.  
Sure its fast but , its really greasy and more greasy..
No thanks.."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the Matthews area and a quick Japanese hibachi is a must have close by for us! We called in two pick up orders last night. Upon arrival I was so excited to learn they have a drive thru! I can get Japanese food And not get dressed?? Yes please!

The food was delicious. I thought it was slightly better than the usual Japanese takeout/fast food. That being said I did not enjoy the extra charge for the \"steak sauce\". Also known as soy ginger. They give you a complimentary 3 oz shrimp sauce but any other sauce is 1$ per extra sauce. At other places I have seen they give all the sauces away. 

Overall great food, quick and easy location, up charge for sauce. Definitely better than the burger and fries fast food option."}
{"text":"This place is gross! Their food is not tasty at all!! Last time I went there, my food had this long hair in it and when I told the manager, she answered very rudely and didn't care too much about compensating me! She told me everyone wears the hair net in the kitchen but just then I saw the guy in the back without the hair net and was fixing his hair with his fingers! When I pointed it out to her she ignored me completely. I was not happy at all with their service and food. Will never go back there again."}
{"text":"A unique take on Japanese food. Almost like a food truck but with less grease. My meal was 5 stars but I haven't tried anything else, so until I do, 4 stars."}
{"text":"Usually pretty decent food. I have had a few instances where it hasn't been that great but I always end up back here because my sister loves this place. When I ask them to do something special (such as cook it a little bit longer), they are happy to oblige."}
{"text":"I love this place. You get a good portion of food for the price. If you don't love sweet carrots, they'll let you substitute zucchini and onions."}
{"text":"It's good, it's quick, and it's cheap. You can get the vegetable medley entree for under $6. The customer service isn't the best, but it doesn't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"We love this place for their yummy, super-fast Japanese food and its reasonably priced. It is right down the road from us so its a great place to stop by on a night you just don't feel like firing up the stove to slave over a meal after a long day's work. 

We have had both entrees with rice and noodles and love both. I would recommend this place to those who love Sogo in Concord. This place is just as good and slightly less expensive. Always have had great service.

Toyama Express is our go-to spot when craving some delicious Japanese hibatchi. Give it a try for yourself."}
{"text":"Quality has gone downhill. This was my go to place for fast Japanese takeout. Lately the rice has been crunchy, the chicken has gristle, and it is extremely salty. Sad it has gone downhill."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this established for over a year now. At first, I was highly satisfied with the food, the service and the value. (see previous review). I would come here OFTEN. So much that the staff knew my face and order over the phone and in person. 

When I was all \"hibachied\" out after the spring and decided to diversify my dining options.  Last month, the hankering returned. I've come two previous times and I've noticed the customer service and quality of the food took a nosedive. (I even walked out on my last visit due to the service). I decided to give them in last chance in light of all of the other great visits. 

Today I placed a call for pick up. When I called I was immediately asked to be put on hold without the business name even being stated (or stated so quickly it was unintelligible.) I proceeded to remain on hold for 6 minutes. By that time I'd arrived. (As a point of reference: Typically I call 10 minutes prior and am told the order will be ready in 5 minutes and it is hot and waiting upon arrival.) 

When I walked in (still on hold) there were two cashiers working, two food runners, two chefs and a guy wandering around behind the counter. There was only one party in front of me. I stepped out, hung up and tried to call again and I was immediately asked to be put on hold. I hung up, stepped back in and wasn't welcomed to the counter but rather nonchalantly waved over as if I were interrupting the cashier's day.

I calmly asked to speak with a manager. The two cashiers didn't respond but just looked around. Finally one asked said to a very young man (the wanderer) who clearly was not the manager, \"She wants to speak with a manager\".  

He just looked at me. Never an acknowledgement. I proceeded to explain to him that I'd remained on hold for six minutes. 

He just looked at me blankly and said, \"I'm sorry\". No offer of atonement, no empathetic nonverbal cues, nothing. He followed up his lacking apology by asking , \"So would you like to order now?\" At this point I recognized his voice from initial six-minute-hold-call. 

Clearly sensing a lack of managerial prowess, I asked again to speak to a manager. Only then did he state that he wasn't in. I told him I wanted to be contacted when he returned and he just said, ok. I then had to prompt him,  to take down my contact info. He pulled a random stack of receipts and began to write the information. I told him that I would be following up later in the week if I didn't hear back. 

I ordered and then he stammered, \"I will talk to the rest of the employees about it.\"

This is the third consecutive visit where I've had an issue. 
1st: skimpy portion
2nd: clueless response when I asked for extra noodles (and was willing to pay) due to the previous skimpy portion

And this visit. 

Let me be clear. I understand that no establishment is perfect. As a former food service employee and customer service manager, I understand that there will be hiccups. 

I've been a loyal client in spite of those hiccups: 

1) I'd stopped ordering the chicken due to the dry, rubbery texture and switched to the steak. 

2) I figured out early on that you have to specify well done onions and mushrooms because in their entrees these vegetables come out barely warm and still raw. 

Still I stuck with them because the service was good, the the food is flavorful, portions were ample and the prices are great. Now only half of those statements are true. 

I will update my review with the manager's response,  if contacted as promised. However, until this poor customer service is resolved, I will no longer be patronizing this establishment. 

For the solution to the problems is this: 

Comprehensive customer service training for all employees, including how to handle grievances when they arise. 

Good food gets customers in the door but good service transforms customers into patrons."}
{"text":"Please don't come here! The staff was very unfriendly and clearly don't care about customers. You can feel they just want to take your money and give you subpar food. After leaving the restaurant, I immediately felt like throwing up and still feel sick to my stomach about the food for some reason. I'm definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Toyama more times than I can remember!  I would estimate easily over 50 times.  The food is always fast and good.  Occasionally a coworker's order or two has gotten screwed up in our extra large office lunch orders, but the owners have always made it right if we called and told them.  They have the cheapest salmon entree anywhere!  I would request it medium rare to avoid the possibility of getting an over cooked piece of salmon.  It only happened to me once or twice.  Typically it does come out perfect.  I do wish they had a side of lo mein noodles for my picky toddler.   I end up ordering the vegetable noodles with a side of rice so he can get what he wants.  All in all, Toyama is the best quick service Japanese place I have found in the University/Concord area.  They will customize just about any order.  Just ask :)"}
{"text":"Food is always good here. That's the most important. Service? I don't know about other Toyama Expresses in Charlotte but the service here is pretty good. The people at the walk-up counter are all friendly and though they shout out things in different languages (that you wouldn't understand) to each other, they're always nice to you.

The carrots are not too mushy, the soy sauce on the rice is not too salty, and the hibachi steak is so good. Shrimp is good too but I usually go with the steak. My wife loves the shrimp though. So again, I give them four out of five stars for feeding me right last night."}
{"text":"Such a good place to go for lunch! It takes 10 minutes or less to get your plate and the prices are so cheap that you will come back once a week and not realize that you've spent a 1/4 of your food budget on Toyama's. But it's worth it! The employees are always nice and this is def. a favorite of mine in the UNCC area. 

The shrimp sauce and the hibachi shrimp are the best I've ever had and you get very generous portions! They also surprisingly have really good sweet tea. 

pro tip: If you aren't a fan of the sweet carrots or broccoli you can get extra rice!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! I love the salmon entree. I order it everytime I eat here. I'm sure their other entrees are just as good, but the salmon is my fav. Definitely recommend this place if you're in the mood for something good."}
{"text":"I come here about once a week. I recommend the hibachi chicken. The wings are actually really good too! Depending on how busy they are (they're usually packed every time I walk in) sometimes the rice can be a bit undercooked, but besides that it can't get any better than getting $6 worth of food to feed two people."}
{"text":"A college age friend sang the praises of Toyama, so I gave it a try on a Saturday night. First of all, it was SLAMMED packed with a very diverse group of people of all ages. So that was a good sign. I ordered the hibachi shrimp and broccoli. It was ready in a reasonable time. That being said, it was an average Shrimp and broccoli that you get an any old Japanese restaurant. 4 stars.

I returned about a week later and tried the jumbo shrimp noodles. The shrimp were good, a little overcooked, but nothing shrimp sauce can't fix. My issue was with the noodles. They were salty, dry, and didn't come with any vegetables. I was expecting more of a lo mein. Regardless, the dish underdelivered and I would not order the noodles here again."}
{"text":"This place is GOOD. My go to place for teriyaki chicken. Always has a pretty packed house especially between 11-1 seeing there's a ton of local businesses in the shopping center. Service is really fast and pretty spot on. Prices are amazingly cheap right around $6 with large portions. I haven't been to the Matthews location but I'm pretty sure they're just as good."}
{"text":"I am dismayed at people giving this place low reviews!  Toyama has become our go-to, the kids are gone and it's friday night place!  The lady manager is super friendly.  Takeout if you're only ordering 1 or 2 items is quick, but it is a little slow with more than that (come on, they're making it fresh). 
Service is extremely fast, and the food always hot and very tasty.  It's also reasonably priced for the quality and quantity you're getting.
So why, you may ask, only 4 stars?  Well, this isn't life-changing, highly authentic Japanese.  It's a hibatchi grill.  It's at least as good as most of the others I've eaten at, and much better than anything at a chinese buffet.  But it lacks a certain \"something\" that catapults it to the truly great.
Still, I eat there at least once every 2 weeks and love it."}
{"text":"Not good at all. I don't understand why all the UNCC students love it....maybe they have not had good food? This place sucks. The only thing that is good is the prices."}
{"text":"Love this gem!

I ALWAYS get the shrimp and scallops combination plate. It's really really good food. I always bring anyone new in town here because they never mess up and no matter how fancy or basic your palette is, the food is downright enjoyable. 

They are always busy but they prepare the food quickly. Prices are reasonable for the quality of food. 

All I'm saying is that you have to try it because I could not rave more about this place. 

I've had 2 main issues below. But I still love this place.

Cons:
1. They have the habit of closing earlier than the posted time. I've come at 8:50PM before and was told they are closed even though the listed time is 9:30PM. No explanation just \"We're closed.\" Alright then. 
2. There is no specific wait area for to-go so if you are taking something to-go you're awkwardly maneuvering around to try your best to not be in everyone's way."}
{"text":"Inexpensive food. Great place to go to for some comfort food. Love the sweet carrots and the shrimp sauce."}
{"text":"Old faithful go-to meal! My family and I eat this Japanese Hibachi food religiously. It's quick and well proportioned Hibachi. 

Call in your order 5min. ahead of time and your food will be ready in 2min. We never wait except when we're dining in. The wait time also depends on the time of day, but they are committed to serving expeditiously. 

I usually order shrimp teriyaki and my fiancé orders the steak and shrimp. We usually get both plates with fried rice and vegetables. Speaking of vegetables, their sweet carrots are the best compliment to the rice and meat of your choice. 

When in doubt for dinner, Toyoma Express is the best!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to for good fast hibachi in the University area. Whether calling ahead or going inside you won't be waiting long, even during the lunch rush they get you in & out. They have a good menu already but if you want a combination you don't see or to add/subtract anything they will accommodate you. I usually get extra veggies and no rice and there's no up charge. I'm not a fan of shrimp/yum yum sauce but they have a really good ginger/steak sauce that I get instead & it goes great on everything not just the steak. My go to is usually the salmon with mixed veggies which is delicious and less than $10 can't bet that. 
The prices and portions are really good. I haven't ate in but there are plenty of tables & on a nice day you can seat on the patio. 
There is plenty of parking but also a lot of other restaurants around so you might not get one that closer if the area is really busy. 
Server is always great, never had any complaints they are very fast and efficient getting you in and out but will offer you suggestions if you need them."}
{"text":"It was OK. I ordered the hibachi chicken entree with mushrooms, sweet carrots, and added zucchini & onions. While the veggies were really good, my chicken was dry, despite putting shrimp sauce, soy sauce, & Sriracha on it. I also ordered miso soup, one of my faves. I was disappointed that it was so bland - I didn't even finish it."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try after hearing my daughters rave about the food so I stopped by for a takeout order. I ordered jumbo shrimp noodles, an order of wings, and a side of fried rice just to try it out. I love the taste of fried rice, IF it's done correctly in a carbon steel wok.

Apparently the young lady that took my order didn't hear me - or wasn't paying attention - so I received the wings and fried rice I specifically ordered along with an order of jumbo shrimp and 'broccoli' that I DIDN'T order. I specifically told her noodles. But no problem, I didn't say anything and took the order home.

The wings where good, not the best I've ever had, but good. The fried rice was - in my opinion - lackluster at best. It didn't seem to have much of a 'fried rice' taste to me. But that was okay too because after a quick spin in MY carbon steel wok it was much better!

The broccoli, shrimp, and carrots were WAY over cooked. The shrimp were so over cooked in fact not only were they like rubber but the flavor was completely gone. Shrimp are very easy to over cook so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on that too.

The carrots apparently were steamed and bland ... BORING!

The little cup of shrimp sauce was okay I guess. Are you're suppose to dip the shrimp in it, or just pour it all over everything to help out since everything seemed to be tasteless? 

Will I go back? Absolutely! I'll give a restaurant three chances. I'll chalk this first visit up to them having a bad day. I was told the noodles are suppose to be good. I'll give that a whirl next time. All I can say is that next trip better impress the hell out of me!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here based on some reviews here and some co-workers I'm in training with. Wasn't sure how good it was going to be but the price sure seemed good... 

Food was excellent. Was it a little greasy, as I've read here? Maybe just a little. But that certainly didn't detract from it. I've eaten at much fancier restaurants and much more expensive ones with hibachi that didn't taste this good. Was it perfect, no... But I'd eat here once or twice a week if I was local. 

Definitely worth the stop and the price. Had the Hibachi Chicken and the Hibachi Steak. Definitely worth it! Great place!"}
{"text":"I love Toyama with all my heart & soul. The food here never disappoints me (possibly because I always get the same thing). The food is reasonably priced and you get a great helping of food, I usually split my meal up in order to finish it all. It is very busy around lunchtime and closing time at night. Only reason I am not giving five stars is because it is a small restaurant, so when waiting for your take out order it is very awkward finding somewhere to stand."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places to go as a student at UNC Charlotte. I would seriously go sometimes 3 or 4 times a week in my last year. For the value, you can't beat it.

My usual order was a teriyaki chicken with rice and carrots. For about $6, there isn't any other non chain in the area that can beat it imo."}
{"text":"AMAZING! This is the best food for the money in Charlotte hands down. My girlfriend goes to UNCC and I make sure to eat here evertime I visit. You wont find anything better for under $10.... anywhere"}
{"text":"Another must try in the Mallard Creek area. I would have to say it is a gem in the hiding. My wife and I attempting to make a decision on our Saturday lunch ended up making a good decision eating here. 

My wife order the chicken and broccoli which she completely loved. The chicken and vegetables were cooked perfectly. The side of sweet carrots were simply delicious and very tender. I ordered the steak and chicken combination plate which again was cooked with the right amount of flavor. The food was not greasy or overwhelming covered with sodium. 

The place was extremely quick and I was out of there in less than 12mins. 

Will be going again. No pictures since the food was devoured before I even got a chance."}
{"text":"This is my first visit here ..  damn good is sooo good .. fast service too .. worth of money 
Will definitely visit again.. thanks to toyoma team."}
{"text":"I went back to Toyama and had the hibachi chicken -- I liked it a lot better than the noodles.  The chicken had big mushrooms in it, with steamed carrots on the side (practically a dessert)."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Don't let the outside fool you, it's nicer inside. You order at the counter and they bring your food to the table. Pretty good food especially for the price."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally find a good Express Japanese spot but I was very disappointed. My husband and I ordered ( I order the hibachi steak). Our food came and mine was accidentally chicken instead of steak, no big deal. I go up expecting them to easily change it and they tell me its $1 to get steak as if they didn't believe that I had ordered steak to begin with. I go back and look at my receipt and see the guy had rung it up wrong (again-not my fault). So I'm searching for $1 for them to fix THEIR mistake. As I'm waiting for them to prepare my food again, I have no time to eat it because my husband was already finished and they were closing. I sat sipping the drink I had paid for. I get my food finally and go to refill my tea so I can just go home. It was only a minute or 2 after closing with about 6 or 7 people still there and they tell me they already turned the drink machines off and I couldn't refill my drink. Highly disappointed that because of their mistake my experience was no short of being pretty terrible."}
{"text":"I love this place. If you get the Salmon you have to tell them not to overcook it. The food id always good and most of all its an excellent value."}
{"text":"Location:  shopping center/strip mall
Parking: Parking lot with a Starbucks, dry cleaners, etc. Can become very crowded at peak times.
Call in/take out available
Atmosphere:  high and standard tables, plenty of windows, TV on wall, outside patio area
Order and pay at counter, servers will call your number and bring food to table.
Quick and hot hibachi style food
Value:  a lot of food for the money
My go-to meals are shrimp hibachi or shrimp and steak hibachi.  I substitute the sweet carrots for zucchini and onions to compliment the mushrooms and broccoli.  Meal includes shrimp/white sauce on the side."}
