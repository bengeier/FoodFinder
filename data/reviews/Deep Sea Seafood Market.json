{"text":"I love this place, I go here for lunch twice a week they prepare everything fresh,friendly staff the waitress she is so nice with the best service anyone wants, My two favorite sandwich are the mahi mahi and the grouper with chipotle sauce on the side YUM!YUM! make sure you ask them to give you chipotle sauce it has a little kick to it but delicious goes very well on the sandwich and potato wedges :)"}
{"text":"This place is spotless. The cases with the seafood are neat and well lit. Better than that, our shrimp stuffed portabellos were outstanding. We prepared them in our stove top kettle smoker with a few alder chips. Outstanding!   I love the fact that they carry local and wild-caught seafood instead of the farm raised, imported products from SE Asia that other outlets sell. The extra amount they charge for this quality is well worth it.  I hope that they keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Great fresh food and great service. I love the shrimp po boy. Their blackened fish is great. Everything has always been wonderful"}
{"text":"A great place to visit for fresh seafood. Has a very casual feel supported by a plethora of nice folk who visit often. I would recommend the fish tacos for lunch and to try the lime slaw."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! I've tried everything on the menu, which changes seasonally, and have never been disappointed. The waitress (Gina) makes every visit a pleasure!"}
{"text":"The seafood at Deep Sea Seafood Market is fresh and delicious. The man at the register was polite and was kind enough to help me decide what I wanted since everything on the menu looked good. I had the smoked salmon BLT minus the bacon and it was tasty. I enjoyed the cilantro slaw and will have to try the steak fries next time. I will definitely go back for lunch."}
{"text":"Hush, don't tell anyone how great this place is! Deep sea is essentially a seafood shop that serves lunch and more recently dinner, tucked away off Monroe road in an unassuming strip mall. I had read about it somewhere and decided to try it out; I'm glad I did, we are now regulars!. If you go for lunch, order your food at the counter then find a table. It seats maybe 28 max and is always busy. Lunches run around $10 give or take, and it's some of the freshest fish you'll find in Charlotte. Presentation is always top notch. Recently they began serving dinner...I had to admit I wondered who would want to go out for dinner to a fish shop. You know who? Me!  They start serving dinner at 5pm and step up the class, lights are dimmed, silverware and nice table mats, music from Larry's fabulous record collection playing in the background. It's BYOB with a reasonable corkage fee of $2.50 per person. No parties larger than 6 because it's a small place. Next time you want fabulous seafood, step outside your norm and head over to see Larry and Traci. Good food, good people."}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever had a bad meal here. This place is definitely hidden and unless you are looking, you'll drive right by. The menu changes daily but my go to is always always (yep.. two always  :) ) the seared tuna and applewood smoked bacon sandwich.. Mmmm so good! The steak fries are just ok as they are never fully cooked on the inside but this place is worth it. Everything is made to order and as you order and seating is limited so get there early to be beat the rush.."}
{"text":"Great seafood, great prices would definitely recommend for anyone wanting fresh seafood."}
{"text":"The food and customer service were both amazing. Really friendly and welcoming staff with flavorful food!!!"}
{"text":"I have only eaten there a few times but the food is Great. The fish is fresh and tasty and there lunch menu is reasonably priced. The service is excellent as well. I think its family owned and operated so its always a familiar face."}
{"text":"Great place for seafood, went today for the first time. The lady behind the counter was super nice and prompt. I chose the blackened Swordfish with jasmine rice - very good and just the right amount of heat. The place was about half full at Noon and food was delivered within 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Awesome! Just returned from the beach and had seafood all week. Thought shrimp was the last thing I wanted for lunch, but decided to check this place out. So glad I did! I ordered the Shrimp Po-Boy, and must say it was fresher tasting than any I got at the beach. Steak fries were hand cut. Friendly staff. Sanitation grade was 99%, very clean place. Menu does change daily with some of the same items daily as well. If you need lunch or want to take fresh seafood home to prepare this is the place. Stop in, you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the hype is about but the food my boyfriend and I ordered was fresh but bland. I didn't like the fries (chips). Average service. Don't know if I want to give it another shot by trying something else. The pictures I've seen posted look good. Maybe they have improved since we went. Otherwise might be worth buying some fresh and cooking yourself at home. Fish and chips a definite no."}
{"text":"Hubs and I love this place! Wish their lunch hours extended into dinner.  My favs include tuna sandwich and grouper sandwich.  Everything is always fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"Place was clean. Everything tasted fresh (except the sweet tea). The fries didn't have much flavor, BUT they were very clearly real potatoes, not processed. I didn't exactly care for what I'd ordered, but it wasn't bad - just not my thing, I guess. We did get some prepared shrimp-stuffed portobello  mushrooms which I baked for dinner and they were DIVINE. I'm planning on going back to try different dishes."}
{"text":"What an unexpected delight this tiny little fish market is!  While I can't attest for the raw product, I can tell you this place gives ANY seafood restaurant a run for it's money when it comes to lunch.   Lunch is serves 11-2pm on weekdays and on Saturdays.  The space isn't fancy, and you just order at the counter, but I swear, the mahi-mahi bahn mi sandwich really had me scheming on when I could go back next.  The fish was perfectly cooked, spiced and on a bed of pickled veggies and cilantro. Granted, the bun wasn't a crusty French roll, like a bahn mi should be on, but the soft and hole-y cibatta was actually perfect for sopping up all the excess juices.  The fries were a pleasant surprise too.  Big and hand cut, browned and skins on.  Nice toothy bite, but soft and not too salty.    The service is friendly and honestly, the space is much less pretentious than some other fish markets in town.    BONUS: I'm pretty sure I saw a sign indicating the sustainability of the products they sell.  Nice!"}
{"text":"Great food, but the one guy up front has the personality of a rock. It was like I was imposing when I was placing an order.  No Customer service skills at all.  Good luck in the return business"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem for fresh, delicious and fast seafood. Would highly recommend for lunch; especially the tuna and avocado sandwich. Could eat this everyday for the rest of my life. Haven't stopped in for dinner but the menu looks excellent."}
{"text":"Edit: Front guy was happier and man is their food delicious. I'd like to repeat that I am not a fish person, but I could probably eat their lunch every day."}
{"text":"Saw PRIMUS / Tool concert at Bojangles 01/26/16 and stayed near I-485.  This morning 01/27/16, was looking for a quick lunch thru Yelp.   Arrived at this place around 11:30am and saw 3 people ahead of us . Order was quick . My companion ordered the blackened grouper sandwich and it was wonderful . I ordered the grilled swordfish with jasmine rice . The meat was fresh and thick . My only complaint was the jasmine rice , it was wet . I'm Asian and I've been eating this type of rice for 50 years and it was not the best . Other than the rice , I would highly recommend this place ."}
{"text":"Second time here and once again unbelievably good. Tried the blackened tilefish sandwich with jalapeño tartare sauce. Excellent!  My wife had the shrimp platter. Huge shrimp cooked perfectly.  All in all a wonderful lunch with outstanding service.  We Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh seafood! It is rather pricey here, but it is well worth it! I was here two days ago for lunch and the tuna tacos were delicious. All the food here is great, I would highly recommend the crab cakes. The restaurant part of the store is only open at lunch but you can get, great fish to cook at home anytime."}
{"text":"Really delicious fresh Seafood. Favorite so far was the buffalo shrimp po boy, and the Cajun Gumbo. They have a lunch rewards program and daily emails of the menu, since it changes daily. Long waits sometimes if you want to sit in and eat, we usually call ahead and pick up. We're lucky enough to live right around the corner. :-) Very family friendly atmosphere, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best seafood we had on our trip.  My seared tuna BLT was excellent.  Great little spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"Very good fresh food and service. These guys are a go to for fresh seafood! Love the shrimp stuffed jalapenos!"}
{"text":"Expensive but it's charlotte--no competition.  Always consistent always good.  We buy oysters annually!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to here was just to pick up some fresh fish. I wanted to back for some prepared food.  So glad that we went back for lunch and had amazing food and service.  The lobster mac and cheese was so good and a huge portion.  The mahi rueben basically melts in your mouth and the oyster shooters were a delicious appetizer. Also we took some amazing Scottish salmon to cook at home"}
{"text":"First time here, and there will be many return trips. To start, a 98 health score such as theirs is always a plus. This place is truly clean as a whistle. They have the very best crushed ice, and even their unsweetened tea was excellent. All too often, many restaurants have horrible unsweetened tea - tasting like mop water - NOT THIS RESTAURANT!!!  Hubby had an alligator sausage po-boy along with some of the best fries ever.  I had the zesty lime shrimp avocado salad, which is so fresh and delicious and comes with a lime-juice sauce. The seafood case had a lot of excellent looking items. The gentleman at the counter was super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I had the mahi mahi, which was pretty good but nothing special. There wasn't enough flavor in the fish, but it was okay. The fries were okay as well. The seafood store itself seems fairly standard, but why pay almost 2x for the same fish that you could get at Costco?"}
{"text":"Stopped in fast before seeing a movie down the road. Only had about 15 minutes so I asked the woman how fast their service is, she said SUPER FAST! So i ordered the seared tuna sandwich and 10 minutes later we made it to the movie! Honestly can't say enough great things about this place, can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Always the freshest fish in Charlotte, perfectly prepared! I love this very casual, friendly, local market and restaurant.  Tonight I ate plain salmon with jasmine rice and green beans.  It's my favorite! However, my other favorites here include the fish and chips (which is light and crisp), seared tuna sandwich, the fish tacos, and  the buttery smashed potatoes.  They're so decadent! The desserts are also delicious.  I swear I don't work here or own a part of this restaurant; it's just that good!"}
{"text":"This is my go to lunch spot if I have a customer in town who wants really good food chowder is awesome  love it every time Lobster roll is great $$ but worth it   Great Job Larry"}
{"text":"BEST SEAFOOD IN MATTHEWS!  I love this place. The atmosphere and staff are very welcoming and I feel as though I am being greeted by my long lost cousin who has had a change of heart. I placed a takeout order and got there just before they closed to pick it up... the shrimp po boy was my choice because I've never been let down by that dish.  I paid for my order then left, wanting to tip them with any extra money I had, the setup was nice in the place: the counter was wide and open, and the kitchen window was to the left (if you are facing the counter), which reminded me of a drive thru. Hahaha pretty funny, I have plenty of jokes. Actually that one wasn't my best but you get the point.  When I left, I opened up the package and got a beautiful shrimp po boy with some sauce drizzled inside, along with lettuce and fries. Every bite I took sent me on a Flavertown vacation, street cred to Guy Fieri. I will DEFINITELY be back here, I just love this place. It was reasonably priced too, about $11, so I feel it was a good meal and was worth the money."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and it was Fabulous!! A small restaurant inside, maybe 6 two-tops and 4 four-tops? I was so excited to try it I forgot to take pics, sorry! We ordered the fish tacos, shrimp po'boy and fish special. The food was delicious, prices were very reasonable and our server was so attentive and kind. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was in the area and looked up places to eat and this popped up. I'm glad it did! Got the crab cake salad to go and a fried flounder sandwich. The crabcake was huge and absolutely scrumptious!!! The flounder sandwich was good but a little of salt would have made it delicious! I definitely want to try some of their dinner items so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Holy SeaFood Heaven.. I saw this place pop up across my newsfeed a couple of times from Yelp friends and from the photos I added a bookmark to try later.  Well today was the day, it's Halloween and the hubby and I dropped off our teenager at work and decided to go out for lunch as oppose to heading home to cook. I pulled up my Yelp and looked at my bookmarks and up pops this amazing grace so we headed over.  We arrived at about 1:54pm and lunch is served until 2pm so we ran in and quickly ordered a blacken grouper sandwich and a shrimp platter.  We took a seat at a two top table against the wall and was asked by several people if we wanted another table with more space. I declined serval offers and finally accepted because I was holding a sleeping baby. One of the owners Nancy walked us over to the other table and offered to push two chairs together to lay the baby out while we eat. This was such a nice gesture (mind you we had no idea she was one of the owners as she was just a friendly woman helping us from ordering to moving to serving us food).  The food arrived shortly thereafter and after praying my husband and I dug in. The food was full of flavor and extremely fresh and served at the perfect temperature. We enjoyed EVERYTHING the fries had so much meat in them which is very rare, they are fresh cut and cut thick.   There is so much more on the menu that we want to try so we will definitely be back. Nancy stopped by and spoke with us for a nice amount of time and even cracked a couple of jokes. Before leaving we grabbed a card and that's when we discovered that she and her husband were the owners. I don't throw around 5 stars (check my page) but I definitely give credit where credit is due and this place deserves 5stars"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequently meet for lunch at Deep Sea. Both the service and the food are excellent. I love that they have a few core menu items and then a few daily specials. The sweet tea is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch place in the area. They never, ever disappoint. Amazing, and so fresh! Kindest over and server too."}
{"text":"Had the lobster roll and clam chowder for lunch, excellent! My son had the fried shrimp Po boy excellent. Took home 1lb shrimp to cook 2nite."}
{"text":"I've finally found fresh seafood in the Charlotte area!!!   The NC trout was delicious.  Great price, too.  Keep on bringing in the catch."}
{"text":"What a great find!  I couldn't wait to visit after hearing how awesome the food is. Food is served there but the dining area is small. From the lunch menu i ordered the corn chowder with  shrimp and andouille sausage and a shrimp po boy. The chowder was THE BEST I've ever eaten. Chunks of shrimp and sausage are complemented by a zesty but not too spicy chowder. The fried shrimp Po boy was crunchy and the remoulade sauce light and tangy. My lunch companions had smoked salmon BLT and blackened grouper sandwiches. They raved about how good they were. As we were eating a long line of customers stood at the counter. Some were ordering fresh fish and seafood to take home to cook. Others took prepared food as takeout. I can't wait to go back again to try another item. I understand the menu changes depending on what fresh fish is available. Lunch and limited dinner hours are posted on their website."}
{"text":"Best seafood in Mecklenburg County.  I go there whenever I can.  The soups are amazing.  The menu is always changing, but I have never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place close to 2 years.  It's a seafood market so you can buy it and take it home and cook it yourself or you can order lunch and they will cook it up for you. I always get the flounder or catfish po boy but the other day I got the seafood lasagna and it was amazing. I bought a po boy to eat there and the lasagna to go. So as I'm leaving the cook says I hope it makes it home talking about the lasagna and I said of course it will. I had to run some errands and needles to say that final statement was on my mind and had me wondering about the lasagna so on one of my stops I said let me taste it. Well it didn't make it home, that seafood lasagna was phenomenal.  5-11-17 This review is just based off today. The food tasted good and it came out in a reasonable amount of time and the service was great but the sandwich that I received today was unacceptable. They gave me this small piece of fish and made a sandwich out of it. I will post a pic but I was pissed."}
{"text":"What a find for dinner! Started with a New England clam chowder that was right on the money. Perfectly prepared super fresh trout and redfish made for a terrific meal. Hard to find seafood at fair prices and with good service."}
{"text":"Best tuna sandwich in charlotte. The slaw was fresh and crunchy. The artichokes on the sandwich were a great compliment. The corn chowder is the best in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I just had the best flounder sandwich with slaw that I have had  in years. It is a small place but the food is excellent. Great steak fries and outstanding fish sandwiches. The service is friendly; I ordered at the counter and the food was brought to me along with my drink.  During the meal they checked if my drink needed refills or was there anything else I needed. Small out of the way spot, clean and bright and the best friend fish sandwich that I have had in years. If you know the difference between fresh fish and the other kind, then you will love this place."}
{"text":"The best place for seafood in town.  I had a spicy  ahi tuna sandwich that blew my mind.  Pro tip: their soups are incredible, don't pass them up!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my family and it was amazing! Have never had fresher seafood anywhere in Charlotte. Come try it! You won't be disappointed. Everything is homemade and family run. Met the owners and they take great pride in making fresh and really tasty food :)"}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch today, wonderful experience! Staff was friendly, didn't have to wait long for my food, and my crab cake sandwich (and fries) were flavorful and perfectly cooked! 5 out of 5 stars! Delicious!"}
{"text":"We came in for a late night snack as I have this place booked marked from another Yelp referral. Boy in this case you can believe the hype. Fish case was closed but we ordered ours to go. I had the Tuna Steak and my wife had the Shrimp Po Boy. Both came with perfectly cooked thick cut fries. My tuna steak brought tears to my eyes and I was smacking and hold my sandwich like it was a work of art. The tuna was cooked just slightly nicely and tasted so fresh and flavorful. The spicy glaze on the steak hit the spot.  You know how your significant other sees you in enjoying your meal and plays that game do you want half of mine and we share, well today my answer was \"heck no\". I would definitely order another the next time in the neighbor. The wife had the Po Boy and the shrimp was cooked perfect and was overloaded nothing skimpy here. Side note the place was impeccably clean for a fish market. We will be back and bring reinforcements."}
{"text":"The food was ok however I wish the portions were better. The portion of side fries and slaw (which was very tasty) was undersized. The server was very attentive."}
{"text":"Love this little spot! Always delicious, fresh.  Never been disappointed. Just don't sit at table of four if you're a party of two or less.  They actually will tell you to move."}
{"text":"Special because it has fresh, varied, QUALITY, seafood and Creative, property executed, chef inspired preparations. Not fancy, schmancy, but as close to a New England seafood dive as you will find in the South. Plastic forks, etc.   TIP!- When they have them...get the Lobster Rolls done the way they are supposed to be...meat, bun, butter and a little celery. NO MAYO!!! This is a very good and rare thing. See picture! I want.   Soups are excellent, shrimp are huge, server is nice and conversationally friendly. Owner is behind  the counter so you know he has his eye on the ball. It is a 40 minute drive from my home but I am hoping we can get our own Deep Sea in York County."}
{"text":"I was hoping to catch them on a lobster roll day, but unfortunately that did not happen.  Instead I ordered the blackened catfish po-boy with fries and a cup of the corn chowder with shrimp & andouille sausage.  I was pleased with how quickly they finished my order, and although I ordered it to go, I ended up eating inside.  I will say that the soup was so amazing I wanted to order another cup.  The po-boy was amazing as well and the blackened seasoning does have a slight kick so have water on standby.  The bread was fresh and didn't get soggy with the toppings, but the fries were hard and overcooked.  I will continue to try to catch them on lobster roll day though."}
{"text":"Best seafood restaurant in charlotte. I drive 30 minutes for lunch multiple times a week to eat here. 2 favorite items are Tuna and Smoked bacon sandwich as well as Mahi Mahi Bahn Mi"}
{"text":"Freshest seafood in the area. Nicest people, always helpful. Really good gaspacho and soups."}
{"text":"This place has amazing seafood!  They are also great a quick lunch or dinner at their location.  They are a hidden gem in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is worth a visit! It's hidden in a small strip mall and sandwiched between two auto repair stores, which normally wouldn't herald a great seafood place, but this place defies the odds! They have a dine-in menu which changes daily. Lunch consists of po-boys, grilled fish sandwiches and fish & chips. They have a daily soup special, which is always a winner, and most sandwiches come with a side of steak fries. The dinner menu is a bit elevated, with a fresh catch special each evening. It's affordable and casual, but kind of a neat place since it is small and cozy. They also have a take-out counter where you can buy fresh-caught seafood to take home and prepare yourself. We bought a pound of sockeye salmon and it was incredible!"}
{"text":"The day has finally come! Lobster Rolls are in season, Omg I can barely contain myself. You know how you can tell if a restaurant is 5-star worthy? If you see the email alert for lunch and you drive 30 minutes out of your way to go get some lobster! Yeah, I'd say that qualifies.  Late lunch, the staff already knew what I wanted when I walked in the door. I've been asking about 'em for months now. I was a bit afraid that everyone else's rave reviews of these rolls were hyping them up too much. My order arrived at the table and I was in awe. Just look at my picture and you'll get the gist. Connecticut Style Lobster served with butter, lemon, and herbs, that's it!  Was it worth it? After two past failures at other places that supposedly specializes in lobster Rolls, this one was the read deal. A generous amount of lobster in every bite, herbs and lemon was just enough to amp the lobster flavor, toasted bun. It was just, blissful! No more words, just go and get one!  Come in and sign up for their email alerts to know what the lunch specials will be daily. You won't leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ok ok so I may have been dragging my feet on writing this review. I wanted to keep Deep Sea all to myself!! Muah hahahah...  This place is amazing. Deep Sea is a seafood market that sells the freshest seafood around, from 11-2 Monday through Saturday it turns into a lunch spot. It is quite unassuming from the outside. You walk into a simple, clean space. The menu changes daily depending on what is fresh that day. There are a few items that you will always see on the menu. My favorites so far... Any version of the tuna Sandwich, Mahi Mahi Tacos, and the Blackened Catfish Po'Boy. You have two options for sides, steak fries or cilantro slaw. I always get the cilantro slaw. Which is fresh and not mayo heavy. The cilantro adds a pleasant zing to the side. I would be really excited it they added more side choices - maybe a salad or soup option would be nice.   They have a small seating area with 5 tables total. The tables fill up during peak lunch times. My suggestion, grab your lunch to go and find a nice bench to eat it on and enjoy the outdoors. The man at the counter seems a bit gruff and unfriendly but he is a good guy.   Next time you are around this part of town, make sure you stop and give Deep Sea a try! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food is Awesome I  tell all my friends about this place. I'm from  Atlanta I always stop by. They aim to please you. Great Husband & Wife Team."}
{"text":"Part seafood market and part small seafood restaurant, Deep Sea Seafood Market is a great stop for fresh seafood. You can have a top notch seafood meal without spending high end restaurant prices. The scallops were very good and the shrimp po boy was excellent. Hand cut fries were really good."}
{"text":"So happy this place is next to where I live.  Huge seafood guy so always try to go here if I can for my sea food.   Larry is very knowledgeable about all of the fish he sales which is a huge help also"}
{"text":"I love how fresh everything is. I have tried several of their lunch items and have been very pleased. Their fried flounder is delicious. Their fried fish sandwich comes with coleslaw and a side of fries and it is wonderful. I haven't taken any fresh fish home to make at home."}
{"text":"I'm still beyond happy that this wonderful place is within walking distance from our home. The seafood is the freshest you will find in the city. The fish tacos and crab cakes are the best!!! You don't want to miss this great place for lunch or dinner, I even run in and pick up fresh salmon and crab cakes to bring home to throw on the grill. Okay now that my mouth is watering I know where I'll be over the weekend:)"}
{"text":"I've worked hard all week and eating on the fly.  I purposely drove 15 miles to this restaurant to enjoy a dining experience. Didn't know they close at 8 pm- early for a Friday. So before I even tasted my food. I can tell you that I came towards the end of the night albeit close to closing I asked if they were still open for business I was told they were my food was prepared in a to go bag. When asked why it was prepared to go a lot of excuses rather than correcting the unwelcoming error. SMH. I was told this is good food but to me it was served on a rusty platter.   #customerservicematters!"}
{"text":"Nice spot! SO HAPPY to have a local fish market in Matthews! Everything is always so friggin' fresh!!! I enjoy a Pescatarian based diet so this is the next best thing to my kitchen/stove!! The smashed baked potatoes in garlic & evoo are genuinely my fave! Their fried cod is impeccable, too.."}
{"text":"This place is always good. Food is consistent and the service is great. Nice small independent operation. They always change their lunch specials, so it's a good idea to get on their email list. My only gripe is that they only serve cooked food from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m."}
{"text":"2 years later and it's still excellent and I am still getting to the blackened grouper sandwich."}
{"text":"As a San Francisco native and world traveler this is the best seafood restaurant I have found since living in Charlotte the slaw is not to be missed ! The owner Larry and his wife Tracy have a jewel here ! Great atmosphere pleasant warm and inviting. Don't miss This place ! Will be back many times"}
{"text":"This was the first time I went here and I will be defiantly go back . I had the spicy shrimp with zucchini  noodles it was really good and nice and fresh . The sauce was nice and light . The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I am a new and loyal customer of Deep Sea Seafood Market which is excellent place to grab lunch or stock up on a wide assortment of fresh seafood.  I recommend the salmon and mahi.  Not only is it the best seafood around but the prices rival grocery stores like Harris Teeter.  The owner is very helpful and can even special order specific seafoods for you (live lobster!).  Even if you live in a different part of Charlotte- TRY THIS PLACE OUT!!!"}
{"text":"The cilantro cole slaw is amazing!  The fried flounder sandwich is also delicious. What makes this restaurant 5 stars is the customer service though. Noth better than great food and great customer service."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I never noticed this place before. It's next door to the UPS store and I saw the big sign in the window that they serve lunch, in addition to selling fresh fish.   First, the place does not have that awful fishy smell that knocks you off your feet at most fish vendors. It's clean and cheery. Order your lunch at the counter and they bring it to your table.  Or get your lunch order to go.   I had the halibut fish tacos which were nicely spiced and flavorful.  The tacos came with big, fat fries. And I ordered unsweet tea. The tea came with a nice wedge of lemon without having to ask.  I will be back for lunch another day now that I've found this little gem in Matthews."}
{"text":"Fresh, perfectly cooked, simple, delicious, great price, good portions.  Really enjoyed the blackened grouper sandwich thanks to the house made condiments (has a flavorful kick from the jalapeño).  Service was fast and friendly enough, environment was well kept and very clean.  Other customers  ordered shrimp po-boy and arancini and I couldn't help but gaze in admiration.  Fries were dense and okay, but my coworker thoroughly enjoyed her fish tacos."}
{"text":"After reading several Yelp reviews I decided to finally find and try Deep Sea. I would probably never notice this place if I were to drive by it on a normal day being that it is in a small strip mall. The place is pretty simple but I don't mind the ambience as long as the food is good. The menu is not the same as the lunch menu and they have rotating specials so I highly suggest you call the restaurant before visiting. I kept asking for lunch items I saw on Yelp and they were not available for dinner. Bummer but I was ok with it. The menu is not overly complicated where you cannot choose what to eat but there is plenty of options. I had the pan seared tuna sandwich with fries. The sandwich was amazing, a little spicy due to the slaw that comes on the sandwich but still enjoyable. The portion was more than enough for me. I wish this place was closer to my job so that I can try the lunch menu but I will be back."}
{"text":"Six month later and this is still the ONLY place for lunch around here (IMHO)  Service can be slow, they run out of items at times, yet instead of cutting corners this foodie couple who runs Deep Sea strives to make the food better, tastier.  And succeeds: the new grilled tuna sandwich w/ artichoke roasted pepper compote & rosemary basil aioli  kicks @ss!  5 star, really. Now they'll start using \"micro greens\"?  Helen Shwab did a write up on them : http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/10/16/4392612/deep-sea-worth-a-lunch-stop-in.html#.Umvt1xCtbfI  they've been slammed since  I saw that half a dozen favorable were \"filtered\", I doubt they were fakes."}
{"text":"Deep Sea is easily my favorite spot for lunch in the area. There is a different menu daily, which proves that  the fish is fresh and never frozen. My favorite item is the tuna sandwich, which is easily the best tuna sandwich that I have ever had. Everything that I have tried on the menu is delicious, you can't go wrong. The sides are a bit light, but it isn't about the sides, its about the freshest seafood you can get anywhere else in the area with unique recipes. There is also a mailing list that updates you daily with the menu for that day. I have brought many people here to try it out and I would recommend it to anyone who loves fresh fish."}
{"text":"It was great to find a place inland, that offers seafood for lunch. Not only fresh but very simple and delicious. Their focus on just seafood makes this place create great sandwiches. Their breading is out if this world. It's perfectly crisp and not oily at all. Ordered the flounder and shrimp po' boy and both fish and shrimp were perfectly cooked. Don't know what the red sauce on the po boy was,  but it was really good. The tartar sauce on flounder sandwich was a bit too much so I'll just make sure to ask for less next time. Great seafood sandwiches for around $10 in Matthews is a great deal."}
{"text":"Had the seared tuna sandwich and slaw.  Both outstanding.   Seared tuna platter also perfectly prepared.  Bring your own wine or beer and your all set"}
{"text":"If you love seafood   go Best Clam chowder ever!!!  Fresh fish and friendly staff . Great selection of fresh fish and jalapeño corn bread ."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a place that has fresh seafood in the Charlotte area.  I'm not sure I would recommend this place. The food is alright but the owner's attitude is awful. He's rude and gruff. Someone needs to let him know that if you're going to run a business in the South it's best to lose the yankee attitude.  Thankfully the guy that was the server was incredibly nice. If it wasn't for him I'm not sure I'd ever go back. Having good food is nice but good food isn't worth being treated badly as a customer. I had fish and chips which I thought would be a simple dish to try for a first time trip. The fish was fresh no doubt. The fries were over cooked and not that great at all.  Not sure I'll go back there."}
{"text":"Everyone talks about the lobster roll and how great it is and post pictures- but they didn't have it when I went. Said it was a \"special\" yet didn't elaborate on which days It was available or express any empathy that I drove there to get the lobster roll and didn't invite me to come back or offer alternative menu suggestions. I asked if this was the menu and he said \"mostly\". Definitely a let down as I had high expectations."}
{"text":"So this was the first time we ate here. We wanted to try something different. I got the shrimp po boy, it was delicious.  The homemade roumalade sauce was excellent. The cilantro Cole slaw was fresh and not overpowered with seasoning. It was just right. Hubby had the alligator sausage and he said it was so good he ended up eating slow lil. We split the shrimp burger...let me tell you it was soooooo good we wanted to order another to eat right there. We didnt, but are now talking about coming back for dinner later! It was a great experience, it's small and quaint, as if everyone already knew each other. We will definitely be back!! Maybe even for dinner lol"}
{"text":"Went back for dinner tonight. DELICIOUS! I'm a Cape Cod girl living in a Tar Heel world and it's so hard to find a taste of home. What a great find! Our server was so friendly, and the owner was there also. Very clean,no liquor license but for $2.50 you can B.Y.O.B.. The chowda  was creamy (I would have liked bigger clam pieces)and tasty. Fish and chips were very good. Cod was very fresh. My husband had the shrimp Po Boy,he enjoyed it. The oyster shooters were also very fresh. Next time we willtry the clambake. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"One of the better places in this area whether you are getting seafood or lunch.  They are now serving dinner also. Really like this place"}
{"text":"Very good lunch. Fish is excellent. Great selection of fresh seafood to take home too. Very friendly service. This is a must try."}
{"text":"Six of went to the Deep Sea Seafood Market today for lunch.  Restaurant/Seafood Market had fresh items for sale in their refrigerator cases and had a daily lunch menu for in house dining.  Two of us had fish tacos, two fish sandwiches (tuna and flounder), and a shrimp sandwich.  All of our selections were delicious.   The bread was also very good.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I love Seafood and you can tell when it's fresh.  I had the shrimp po-boy and it was delicious.  The staff was really friendly, the place looks really clean too."}
{"text":"Such a great lunch option, love this place! Blackened Mahi sandwich is great and the Halibut over rice is amazing. Never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Decided to try \"Deep Sea\" on Monroe Rd for lunch today. When I try a place for the first time, I usually order something basic, since theoretically, I know what to expect. So I ordered the fried flounder sandwich.  Friendly, courteous staff. Prompt service. Everything was fresh and tasty. But the main ingredient was almost missing. Sandwich was about 90% bread with a very tiny sliver of flounder in it. Unimpressed.  If you want a fried flounder sandwich, I recommend Showmars."}
{"text":"Came by at 12 during lunch hour. Good thing we were the first ones there. It's a small restaurant with few seating available. I had the seared tuna sandwich and my boyfriend had the shrimp Po boy. Both sandwiches we had were amazing!!! They have loyalty card here; for every ten entrees bought you get one free. The worker was very nice and attentive to refilling drinks. The fish tasted fresh. Definitely coming back here"}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem. Found them on Yelp. I had the alligator sausage poor boy which was delicious and the sweet tea was great. Will definitely be back on my next visit to Charlotte.  Service was spectacular."}
{"text":"I've been into Deep Sea a handful of times since they opened - mostly to get seafood to go. They truly have the freshest selection - yes the prices are higher than HT, but this is FRESH seafood. On my last visit I picked up some wild caught gulf jumbo shrimp - they were ginormous! Nothing like what you find at the grocery store.   I've heard great things about their clam bakes/lobster dinners - I have to check one out soon!"}
{"text":"Well what another great find!  The Deep Seafood Market showcases a display of fresh fish at their see through counter space.   There is a smattering of tables around the restaurant for inside diners.  We came in and went to the counter and were presented with the daily menu.   After placing our orders, we quickly found a table.   No other people were dining inside, but it was a rather late lunch.  There is nothing fancy about this place at all.  Plain and simple.  My order was the fish and chips.  It was served on a paper plate.  The fish was fried cod.   The portion size was appropriate, but I wish there had been just a bit more of the cod and a few more fries on the plate. Better for my diet that the plate didn't have more!   Tasty slaw on the side.  It was really the star of the show!   Even if you are not a slaw fan, get it!   The tartar sauce was also good, even though I used a lot of malt vinegar on all the fried stuff on my plate.  Oh yes, it was ALL fried!   We noticed that there was a steady stream of people coming in to get take outs.  My guess is that the majority of their business is take out.   It is a perfect option for either take out or inside dining, if you're in the mood for seafood.   Two thumbs up! I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Have been here three times for lunch and it gets better every time. Amazingly fresh and high grade seafood not to mention complex and delicious food every time. Will be my go to place from now on."}
{"text":"They recently began offering dinner (full table service) which made it easier to finally visit. Service was excellent! Stuffed portabello cap was plenty large enough for two people and not too bready or salty. Large bites of shrimp in it! Flounder with lemon sauce and capers was cooked just right, not at all greasy or salty, very light sauce and served with rice and plenty of asparagus. Pecan trout was very lightly crusted and the fish was cooked perfectly, again not greasy or salty, with rice and asparagus. Prices are where you'd expect (mid-teens per entree). My only suggestion would be to offer more alternatives to rice for a starch (baked potatoes, orzo salads, beans, lentils, etc). I was sad to see that we were the only customers at 6pm on a Tuesday.. maybe the word on dinner just hasn't gotten out yet? I'll be back - regularly!"}
{"text":"After bookmarking this spot, I dropped in one night to try a catfish poboy after craving seafood.  There wasn't a wait. I requested fried over grilled with a side of fries and a cup of sweet tea.  The roulade sauce wasn't the sauce taste I expected.  I was looking for a small kick of heat and the catfish to be seasoned if not well seasoned.  The fries were fresh cut potatoes which I appreciated and it's a rarity.  The meal was prepared quickly and priced decently."}
{"text":"Every good town needs a good fish butcher...monger...seller? Got a $6 piece of Rainbow Trout yesterday. They are quick and clean there. Got that NY kinda attitude about the man. ehh? No time for small talk. Go in, pick out your fish and go."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday for lunch. The place was exceptionally clean and had a friendly staff. You order at the counter, have a seat, and they will bring the food out to you.  Hand-cut fries were good, and they accompany the lunch items. There are printed lunch menus (updated daily) with lots of selections. I had the tuna tacos, which came with a fruit/cilantro salsa that was great.  Great location, easy parking. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Was here on a friday evening 45 minutes b4 closing but you would have never known that because my chowder was hot and fresh by catfish poboy was hot tasty and well prepared and our scallops was done just right.  Well done! Nice little seafood restaurant/market!"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall! Came in with a coworker for a quick lunch and had awesome tuna tacos. The food was delicious and the service was great! Keep up the good work. Felt good to have some fresh seafood especially when my taste buds are spoiled with New England quality seafood :)"}
{"text":"Everything I have gotten from here has been amazing. I frequently buy the cod to make fish and chips, and the NC trout makes fantastic fish stew. I thought my husband would balk at the price of the shrimp, but after he tasted it, he insisted I buy it only from here! I haven't been here for lunch or dinner yet, but the prepared foods (like chowder) that I have bought have also been wonderful!"}
{"text":"Best seafood lunch in town. Very little fried. Everything on menu is great. Blacken grouper sandwich is the best."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch a few weeks ago. I ordered the fish and chips not expecting a whole lot. Wow, was I blown away. The breading had an amazing texture and a nice flavor without being too oily. The fish inside was fresh, tender and flavorful. The fries were well seasoned and the side of slaw wasn't overly \"dressed\" with mayo.   I am glad this place is about two miles from my house as I plan to make this place a regular stop for fish as well as lunch."}
{"text":"We have been searching for our favorite little spot to eat since we moved to Charlotte 3 years ago, and I am pretty sure today we found it. Think of your favorite takeout/dine in spot you went to growing up. Whether that be a little deli, Chinese food, or Greek food. Now imagine finding that same type of favorite place as an adult; comfortable, extremely casual, fairly priced, and honest. Now add the freshest fish and a variety of options to the equation. I'm in heaven. My boyfriend had the fried flounder sandwich. Heart eye emoji ten times! It was so delectable, and the cilantro lime slaw really set it over the top! I had the ahi tuna tacos with watermelon slaw and crumbled feta cheese. You honestly can't do summer better than that! They also sell fresh fish until 5pm everyday. \"Fresh fish isn't cheap, and cheap fish isn't fresh.\" Words to the wise!"}
{"text":"The best seafood!!   We have bought raw fish to cook at home and we have eaten there several times. Their food is delicious!!  If I lived closer I'd eat there a few times a week."}
{"text":"Today's events deserve every bit of this and this is how things unfolded.  Backstory: I saw from Yelper Nikki they offered Lobster Rolls. So I inboxed to learn if it's Regular with Mayo or Connecticut with Butter. I was told they don't offer mayo but it's also not a daily menu item.   I asked for information on the next serving date and it wasn't known so I signed up for daily email alerts. Last night, I received an email notice the Roll would be served today so I actually replied with a thanks (yep, it's a mass email) and made plans to only eat Deep Sea for Friday.   I took the 30 minute drive in the pouring rain today along 485 with some scary drivers (some sped some slowed down that's how hard the rain down pour was rolling) to exit on 52 and arrived at the restaurant at 12:25p to a fully seated area and 5 people in line ahead of me. I checked in as I stood. I took a picture. Absorbed my surroundings and finally saw a menu for the day with a price. I texted about the price which isn't bad in NY but off putting since I had every plan of ordering enough to feed the squad. My goal was to dine in and enjoy mine and take the rest for the road. Well, remember that fully seated area? I noticed two tables - four tops available so I figured someone would move by the time I get my order in.  ** Or I'd ask to dine with other patrons - yeah I'm that Hibachi or Family style dining lady ** It's no big deal.   Proceed to scan the room for available seats. No one else has arrived so I should be good. I wanted to take more pictures but I try to avoid including people in pictures.   Lady ahead of me doesn't order the Roll as her total equals $9. Makes me question what did she get.   Gentleman behind the register turns, without saying a word, with his back to me I follow his moves thinking he will pick up someone's order to help out. This is a smaller venue with a smaller staff so I understand cooperatively working together.   Anywhoo, he returns face forward and I read the 8.5x11 signs to note \"Lobster Rolls Sold out\" I'm paraphrasing but you can see the picture. Of course, I inquire: \"That's after me? As in after I get my order in then we're out?\" He says, \"Nope. Now\" he posts the sign. I grumble this can't be real. A couple of guys walk in and take note of me taking the picture. They inquire as well and then I turn to leave to which they follow.   GPS now says it'll take me 25 minutes to get home so I've wasted an entire hour for squat? Look folks, I get lunch is served from 11a-2pm. I even understand small business budgets yet if the door opens at 11a and you're out by 12:30p then you never had any real intentions of serving much nor many. This felt every bit of a gimmick. Every bit of sorts because I'm not refuting any popularity matters - I am questioning management in terms of planning and execution.   Just went back to reread the email and it's confirmed - no notice of shortages/sells quickly/et al.   Disappointed is an understatement. At a minimum: more could have been planned for so a larger quantity would have been available today. On the other end of the pendulum swing: acknowledge those of us who are clearly standing in your establishment and make some type of courteous outreach. For example: we will serve them again on this day. Please accept our sincere apology and here's a coupon. IDK but something. I don't live within walking distance and this wasn't along my daily route. This was an intentional trip with true sentiments of excitement and joy (sans mayo, 5 stars, small business with an update via email that the offer would be available the next day) based on my minimal interaction to date."}
{"text":"I don't really get why people are so jazzed about this place. I think it's pretty mediocre. If you love cilantro, it's in a lot of the stuff. If not, it permeates a lot of dishes. The fish and chips were extremely mediocre. My mom ordered a banh mi without cilantro and it still had a strong cilantro taste. Attitude of the staff isn't great. Seemed annoyed when we were ordering. Pretty sad this is the \"best\" people can get when it comes to seafood in Charlotte."}
{"text":"So. Much. Yum. I can't believe I've passed this market by for years without stopping in to check them out! Now that I've discovered the secret, I'm hooked... (Get it? Hooked? Sea food place? See what I did there?)   On my first visit, I stopped in for lunch because I saw on their Facebook page that the famous lobster roll was available. It was everything I'd hoped it would be and more. Overflowing with lobster. Buttery. Warm, soft bread. I could have eaten 10 of them by myself. I didn't even realize I was getting hand cut fries with the roll. They were a completely delicious surprise!   I can't wait to get back and try their other sandwiches. (Mahi banh mi has my name all over it.) Maybe even check them out for dinner. They also have an impressive case of fresh seafood to purchase and take home to cook. I'm coming back for those scallops!"}
{"text":"I was excited to have lunch at DSSM. I ordered the grouper sandwich. The fish was very small and didn't cover half the bread. It didn't have much flavor. The fries that came along with them were over cooked and flavorless. I wasn't offered a choice of fries or slaw or I wouldn't have even had them. I paid $11 for half a piece of fish, a bun, and crappy french fries. The service was ok. The people working seemed like they didn't care if I were there or not but said the appropriate hellos and how was your food type things. I will definitely give it another try and order some thing else."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem of a seafood restaurant. Had the clam chowder with abundant clam bites and just the right amount of bacon bits. Blackened redfish was cooked and seasoned perfectly complemented by tasty roasted Brussels sprouts. Wife's prosciutto wrapped scallops were the largest I'd ever seen. Service was prompt and attentive. Prices a little more than expected but as the sign there said \"fresh fish isn't cheap, cheap fish isn't fresh.\""}
{"text":"Very clean, great service, outstanding fish and chips.  The cod was light and flaky and fresh, cooked perfectly and lightly breaded. The fries appear hand cut and were very good.  The tarter again appears to be homemade and also very good.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is pricey but we'll worth it. I has the lobster roll, and it was great. Their Cole Slaw is a lso excellent, friendly staff as well and nice clean environment. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Great place to grab healthy lunch and pick up some seafood for dinner at the same time."}
{"text":"The best seafood market in town , little high but worth it , fried shrimp po boy is crazy good , the only thing The Owner operating this place is a very rude and has a attitude that he's doesn't care if you don't  come back ,  Good seafood , Reasonable prices , Dickhead owner,"}
{"text":"The staff were extremely pleasant and the food was excellent! I had the seared tuna sandwich and it was delicious! Definitely recommend and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last night based on the high Yelp rating and close proximity to my hotel and had awesome crab cake dinner with peach salsa and smashed potatoes. All wonderfun!!  Meaty crab cakes,  little to no filler or binder, with  tasty homemade remulade and cocktail sauce.  The smashed potatoes were a surprise hit.  Didn't expect much but wow!  Buttery, sour creamy, tasty!  And I liked the sweet and spicy kick from the peach salsa.  That meal was so good I encouraged my coworker- friend from to eat here for lunch.  He had the Mahi Reuben sandwich and a side of slaw.  He loved the sandwich.  I tried the slaw and it was bright, lightly creamy and crunchy - so good! There's some lime or something in there that really separates it from your typical Cole slaw.  And I had the seared Ahi tuna with Applewood bacon and spicy slaw on a chibatta bun.  Wow!!  If you like seared FRESH Ahi as an appetizer, you won't believe what a great it is to have it for lunch.  I also enjoyed the corn chowder and jalapeno cornbread. The soup was just the right amount of creamy to meaty ratio.  The cornbread was fresh and moist with crispy edges the way you'd expect from a place that seems to do everything with a high level of attention to detail, balance of flavors and perfect execution. I wanted to try everything I could because I leave Charlotte tomorrow.   I'll be back!!  Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Let's face it, people. Though North Carolina is a coastal state, Charlotte is still not on the ocean. It may only take 3-4 hours to get to the ocean, it doesn't mean we have fresh seafood, by any stretch of the imagination.  To be fair, you can go to the coast - say Charleston or Myrtle Beach - and they don't either. Go ahead and ask, I'll wait. Okay, I won't - the review will. Many places will pretend that they do, but in reality, they serve up freshly frozen seafood, just like everywhere else, and it's promptly flown in (perhaps trucked in) from elsewhere.  So does it really matter? Sure it does. But it doesn't mean that there aren't options. There just aren't many. Deep Sea has some, and when I say some, it means not many, even if you're there - it's not a huge place, and as has been mentioned, those run out, so get yourself there early if you want something, whether it's to cook or to eat on premise (a cool option, to be sure)."}
{"text":"Deep Sea Seafood Market, I love you. A whole lot.   This is one of my favorite places in Charlotte. I've never actually bought seafood from here. My affection and obsession are solely based on the amazing lunch menus they crank out every day.  There are some constant items, but the lunch menu changes daily. They post it every day around 10:30am on their website, Facebook, and Twitter. So, make sure to follow them. Lunch is served Monday-Saturday 11am-2pm, Dinner is Tuesday-Saturday 5-8pm.   I've never had a bad meal here. Sandwiches, fish tacos- it's all damn delicious. My absolute favorite is when they do lobster rolls as the special. They are perfection. Warning: if you see it's lobster roll day, go early to make sure you get one before they're all gone. Also, if you go late and they're sold out, don't bitch about it. That's a you problem, not a Deep Sea problem. Seriously, when they post it's lobster roll day, I derail my entire schedule to make sure I can swing by for one.   Seafood counter-wise, the prices seem pretty fare. Remember: you get what you pay for in life. Good, fresh seafood is worth it. You'll always see the same duo working the counter and tables during lunch. They know all the regulars, all the regulars know them. They are great and will put a smile on your face. It's not a huge place. There are a few tables, but your best bet may be to get your food to go during peak lunch time."}
{"text":"With all the rave reviews,I wanted to check this place out. After a fairly long wait because it looked like they served diners first.I can say I wasn't too impressed with my carry out lunch of an oyster po boy,and New England clam chowder. It's the latter that had waaaay too much rosemary[?], ruining the subtle flavors from the seafood.Shocking considering the reviews of Deep Sea,one would think they could make such a staple in their sleep.Growing up by the ocean,I love seafood,and I wished I spent my lunch coin on another spot.2.5 stars for the personable gentleman working cash."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch and the food was great! I had the blue crab stuffed avocado salad; it was wonderful!  My husband had the tuna and bacon sandwich. He left nothing on his plate.  We will be coming back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Definitely the freshest seafood I have had in charlotte. Been here a couple times and have yet to be disappointed. Po boys are amazing and their fries are delicious. Always leave this place full and wishing I could eat more. Crab cakes had a decent amount of filler but being from the DC area where I am used to Maryland crab cakes I can be somewhat picky. The staff here is always extremely nice when you walk through the door and food comes out in a timely manner. The place is clean and well kept."}
{"text":"OMG this place is incredible!  Whether you are going to pick out some fish to take home and cook, or sitting down for a meal, this place is awesome!  I love their huge counter containing the fish and seeing the giant slabs of tuna and salmon - I wanted to try all of it!  You can get a wide variety of amazingly fresh cuts of fish, oysters, and clams.  Their food options for lunch/dinner are also on point!  Fish tacos and seared tuna sandwich (which was my favorite) were so delicious!  Each of the menu items comes with a side of potatoes (think thick cut french fries), or slaw and I have enjoyed both!  Cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"The food was just ok the steak fries were tasteless and burnt, but what bothered my husband and I  the most was the lack of welcoming and attitude the owner gave us even though he knew we were first time patrons! We will definitely not go back!"}
{"text":"We bought seafood here for about a year before we tried the food, the groceries are always fresh, never frozen. Their quality standards are unbeatable. I usually find tilapia mealy and gross, but we bought some from Deep Sea to make our little girl some homemade fish sticks (she likes to help), and it was firm, flaky and delicious. I tested it several times against Harris Teeter since and it is seriously just better. ...then we tried the food. Now we eat here regularly and usually take home some bacon-wrapped jalapeños or crab cakes. The soups they make are CRAZY good, you can buy those to go too. The grouper sandwich is usually on the menu, which changes with what's available, and it is my favorite. Everything we have ever tried at Deep Sea is done very well or better. There is always a line for lunch, and for good reason... this place is a GEM!"}
{"text":"I've come here multiple times to purchase fresh tuna steaks, salmon , etc , but never tried the food. I was glad they extended their hours to dinner bc I'm just too busy during the day with work. I love the selection of fresh scallops and shrimp,  things here will cost more , but the taste is unbeatable.    As for the food , that kept me from giving deep seafood market 5stars. My seafood Cobb was pretty bland , there was no seasoning on the seared tuna, or the salmon and shrimp,  it actually probably was pre-made earlier that day so that's a frown upside down for my taste buds.  My partner and daughter ordered the Jumbo shrimp entree with steak fries . The fries were a little too thick for our liking, a few were actually not cooked all the way through, and the shrimp , eh, besides the size and freshness, again no seasoning . I would have to say I prefer just purchasing the seafood and cooking it myself, not really a fan of what I have sampled ,but this will not defer me from trying other menu selections in the future .   Either way, I would like to say kudos for the selection of seafood , and I'm  not sure what's up with the previous reviews on service, but the owner with the glasses was pleasant as well as sociable with us, and other customers while we were there ."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to ordering lunch from here today. After calling and having the pleasure of speaking to the gentleman on the other end of the phone this is not a local business I will ever step foot in. Was simply asking questioned about the menu in which his response was, \" we are not going to custom tailor our lunch to you sir\". I just hung up. I had heard enough at that point. Bummed, cause I'm sure the food is good."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place in the neighborhood   They have Great seafood if you're looking to make something special at home. Always fresh and tasty. Plus they have lunch served daily. That was a new one that I didn't know until I went in. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Perfect lunch spot for fresh seafood! Best fish and chips I've had outside of New England. Clam chowder is clam heavy - which is always a good thing. Their menu does rotate but they post it everyday on the website in case you want to make sure they have your favorite before you go!"}
{"text":"Really good food, fresh seafood not the friendliest staff but the food is good. Very clean , great lobsta roll."}
{"text":"First time there, food was good. I had the shrimp po-boy.   Will definetley go back.  The food was very fresh..."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and delicious! Great lunch spot. One thing to be mindful of is that this place has a vibe that is really not family friendly, even with well-behaved kids. One staff member shot judgey looks at a family with kids that were just talking at a totally normal volume and sitting at their family's table. They weren't being disruptive at all, but the looks he was giving them throughout their meal were making it really awkward for others that were just grabbing a bite to eat. Waitress was great and the food was awesome though!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I'm lucky enough to work in the same plaza so I'm a frequent customer, and as a New England transplant, I can honestly say Deep Sea does it right! The blackened catfish po boy is killer, and highly recommend the corn chowder with shrimp and sausage when they have it. To die for! Everything I've ever ordered has been fresh and delicious. Thank you Larry for bringing a true taste of home here to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this spot for awhile as their photos were coming up on my Yelp feed and it looked very good. We finally made it last night. Our very first initial thought was a little skeptical because the 2 of us tried to sit at a table for 4 (we got there 30 minutes before it closed on a Wednesday night), and we spotted the sign that said \"If you're a party of 2, sit at a table for 2!\" The guy quickly asked us to change tables (even though there were a lot of empty tables). He seemed a little irritated we were going to sit there. Our actual waiter (Anthony), however, was very nice and laid back.   We ordered a shrimp po boy with cilantro slaw and an oyster po boy with slaw. I would've liked to have tried one of their entrees, but it was higher than my budget allowed (to clarify, I do not think it was overpriced at all... just didn't have a lot of money to spend on dinner last night). The sandwiches were very nice and flavorful. The bread was soft and a great compliment to the seafood. The jury is still out for me with the cilantro slaw. I usually like cilantro, but I just couldn't eat a lot of the slaw.  I would like to go back again when I've got more money to taste some of their entrees. They close a little early as well (again, not a bad thing... you just have to be organized)."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh seafood! Best in town, no doubt. Get on their email list to find out what's fresh each day. Do not miss lobster roll day!!!"}
{"text":"First time I stopped in I just bought some grouper and swordfish to cook at home. Grouper was good, swordfish was just ok. I stopped in to eat lunch there yesterday and it was awesome. I had the blackened grouper sandwich. The jalapeno mayo on it was fantastic. My coworker had the mahi reuben and he said it was one of the better sandwiches he's had lately. I'll be trying that sandwich next time but its a special so it comes and goes. I had fries this time around which were ok, go with the slaw...it's really good.   I really like the creative tastes they put together here for their dishes. I'll be going back soon to move through a few more of the sandwiches I saw that I have to try. This place is on the up so stop in and enjoy some seafood.   You have to order at the counter when you walk in and then sit down. Someone will bring your drink and food out to you. You can't tip when you use a credit card because it isn't offered when you order. Either bring some cash or you're not going to leave a tip. The service is really good here so bring some cash."}
{"text":"if you're looking for a fried/garlic oyster/scallop/shrimp by the pound place. this isn't it. it's more of a sit-down restaurant serving composed dishes but is also quick service. place definitely gets busy during the 3 hour of lunch service. i got the tomato mozzarella salad with grilled shrimp. it came with 4 pieces of shrimp. why did i get this dish i still don't know. i think i was having a hard time making decisions so i picked something at random which also happened to be the worst value. my friends enjoyed the fried shrimp po boy and alligator sausage po boy. but the shrimp is more heavily breaded than i'm used to. shrimp etouffee, the special, was good, but i recommend you get the staple menu items i.e. mahi mahi bahn mi and fish tacos etc cuz that's what all locals seemed to get"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. It is the epitome of hidden gem. I got the blackened swordfish and my wife got the grilled tuna sandwich. Both were cooked to perfection and seasoned equally as well. The ambiance is inviting and casual. This is definitely a place you must go to before it catches on."}
{"text":"What a welcome surprise on our weekend getaway. We were looking for a good spot to have some fresh seafood and did not want the offerings from the corporate spots. We found Deep Sea and boy were we glad we took the chance. Everything was great. The Pecan Crusted Trout is to die for. The fish and chips were classic and the Red Snapper was cooked to perfection. What a great hidden gem. A spot so nice we had to try it twice. And Anthony the server/bartender/cashier/marketing consultant was outstanding. He commanded the room. He was helpful, he was patient and he had personality. We thoroughly enjoyed our visits. Great Job."}
{"text":"Wow! Wow!  My friend brought me here and said I had to try it.  I'm so glad we did!!  Gazpacho!!!!  Amazing!  And a chicken and shrimp spring roll sandwhich in ciabatta bread.  I will be dreaming of this sandwhich for years to come!  Thank you for a wonderful meal!  Your hard work, talent and expertise really shine here!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Deep Sea after my husband read about it in the Charlotte Agenda. The store doubles as a seafood market (closes at 5pm daily) and restaurant (lunch and dinner).  What's good: - fried shrimp platter (oyster combo is good too but prefer shrimp) - clam chowder - fish of the day - blackened or sauteed - clam bake (steamed whole lobster, clams, mussels, shrimp, corn and sausage) -desserts - most of their desserts are homemade and they are worth the unnecessary calories!  Not so good: - fries - these are often undercooked and lacks crispiness  I heard their fish tacos and the elusive lobster sandwich are good. I would suggest that they put less mussels and more shrimp and sausage in their clam bake bowls. I have yet to try their market portion as we usually go to Clean Catch for sushi grade salmon or tuna, but one day we'll give their sushi grade fish a try.  It's also BYOB with a corkage fee or $2.50/person. Not bad at all!  They've been busier lately since the Charlotte Agenda article and may need to staff up on the weekends to meet the high demand. Two servers for a full restaurant and waiting parties did not suffice, but they did their best.  Check it out!  https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g49022-d6665761-r399694402-Deep_Sea_Seafood_Market-Charlotte_North_Carolina.html#"}
{"text":"Back again for the lobster roll! Tracy put her own twist on it and....it is still amazing. Heaven on a hot buttered roll."}
{"text":"I saw a recent review from a disgruntled customer who drove a long way for the lobster roll and was upset when it ran out when she got there. A one star review was totally unfair when she did not even try any other item on the menu. I would ignore a one star review from a Yelper who posted a review that had nothing to do with the food or service of this restaurant. Everything that I have ordered here have been great and the owners (Larry & Tracy) are the most accommodating in my experience. I buy fish and eat lunch here every week."}
{"text":"Wow!  I was finally able to stop into the store/restaurant when it was open.  It was lunchtime and the place was bustling with patrons.  Ordering was quick and the food arrived not long after.  I ordered to go but had to sit down and eat half before I left the premises.  I ordered the fried shrimp po-boy with cilantro lime slaw.  Honestly, I enjoyed the slaw (at it all) a little more than the tasty sandwich (saved half of that for later). I liked that the food is freshly prepared and you don't have to wait forever when you're hungry. Be sure to check the open times before visiting."}
{"text":"This hidden gem has great lunch and seafood choices. Lunch is made to order, I got the blackened swordfish! It was very good with a large portion and the cilantro lime slaw was yummy, I got a pound to go! Daily catches vary but you can sign up for their email list so you know what they have in the case and for lunch daily. I've also gotten halibut here, very good. The owner told us the best way to cook it and,every fish comes with a lemon"}
{"text":"Wonderful and fresh seafood lunch! Amazing chowder as well. Very expensive by the pound fish and premade rake home options but worth the affordable and incredible lunch menu"}
{"text":"Lunch today. Friend ordered oyster poboy and owner said, \"It's not on the menu.\"  Friend showed him the item on the menu and he replied, \"That's dinner menu\" and proceeded to hand her a different menu.  A little, \"I'm sorry it's not available at lunch. You're looking at the dinner menu,\" would have been much nicer. French fries were burned on outside and not done on inside. None of our group of four ate them. A very expensive few shrimp we had as none of us ate the roll on the shrimp poboy. Been there before and experienced owner's attitude. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very small place and limited seating. The location is tucked away. I would like to see this restaurant expand. I believe they have a very special menu and the blue crab tasted great. It was our first time trying this. The servers were pleasant. I wish they had a wine list. That would have complemented the seafood well"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service! Fresh seafood and delicious sandwiches. Menu changes daily but you will not be disappointed. There's something delicious for everyone. I had the alligator sausage po boy! Juicy smokey deliciousness! I will return!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places to eat lunch. Tucked away in a nondescript shopping strip in Matthews right past the Food Lion on Monroe Road is this fantastic seafood shoppe and lunch/dinner establishment. Not only can you buy from a wonderful and varied selection of the freshest seafood for your own grilling and cooking needs, but also stop in and just nosh for lunch and dinner when you don't feel like cooking and still eat some of the best seafood dishes in town. Of note are the wonderful lobster rolls (if there are any left), fresh seafood salads, smoked salmon BLT, mahi reuben and a host of other seafood offerings that are rotated in and out of the daily menu. They have started offering dinner as well so anyone in the area should for sure give them a chance. They are family owned and operated and always offer the best quality!"}
