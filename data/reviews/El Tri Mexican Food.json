{"text":"Went to get a California burrito and steak and eggs burrito. They were very bad. I chose this place because it was close by. Next time I will drive the distance for better quality Mexican food like Filiberto's.  I tasted like something made at home by a young child."}
{"text":"This place is so gross. It's greasy & the quality of ingredients is terrible. I ordered a shredded beef taco & it was floppy & gross. It was filled mostly with greasy lettuce, there was a smear of beans & a few slivers of what I'm assuming was shredded beef. Never again. This place is terrible."}
{"text":"I hate giving Mom and Pop places low Stars but they kind of deserve it had their street tacos very Bland no taste maybe in Sun City would work but not anywhere else meat tasted old or really cheap or something way too much fat tortillas were undercooked the salsa was really sour service was fine nothing special what you would expect from a place like this"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. You go pay for a burrito, you eat the burrito. Nothing more to this place and certainly not memorable. I will still come back."}
{"text":"Was there today with my family and I saw a Huge dead roach dead on the ground in the middle of the walk way ... and was never picked up ... I never had a problem with the food but after seeing the dead roach really grossed us out"}
{"text":"This place is terrible . I come in with my girlfriend and every time we have come the cashiers are super quiet and awkward, this makes it easy for them to mess up our order like they did today . We go in and order a taco and tostada combo(#1), an extra taco, and a carne asada burrito. After paying we realized that they charged us for 2 combos instead of one, we took it back up to get our money back and to which the unprofessional cashiers were just quiet and couldn't assess the situation correctly, they gave me $6 and 99cents back which is the combo price before tax. I won't be coming back here ever again just such a hassle and food is not even worth it . Would not recommend to anyone . No wonder this place is hiring  it's terrible and I'm sure nobody would want to work here."}
{"text":"Let's start off with this place is not FINE dinning.. With that being said, I read the reviews of others and if you love Mexican food you will always try it once no matter what the establishment looks like. You will find a diamond in the rough.   I have had 2 burritos from this place this week, a carna asada with beans and cheese only. It did not blow me away. If the cheese doesn't melt then your food is not up to temperature. But I said I'll give it another shot and got an Adaba burrito(or how ever you spell it), and I tore it up.. hot, fresh and delicious.. guacamole was fresh and wasn't like water. Afterwards I was mad because I should of got 2. I seen a corn quesadilla with carna asada that looked delicious that I will give a try next week. Will keep you posted"}
{"text":"Food was ok, a little bland.  My big issue was the restaurant was HOT. They had no a/c on, and they had one huge fan which was pointed at the CASHIER!   I sweated through my entire meal.  If I return, which I am unsure of at this point, I would only get takeout.   Cashier seemed very much concerned with herself, and she had difficulty communicating in English.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Just a terrible terrible experience. I work in customer service, and I feel that even if the food is Terrible if you have great customer service everything else will follow.   My wife and I walked in and the cashier was on her phone and never acknowledged us. So I stood right in front of the register I refused to say Hi first she did not utter one word until we started ordering. We should of left after that but continued ordering our food, girl had no idea what was even on the menu. Food came I ordered a quesadilla. Didn't realize I was at a pizza place because my footlong quesadilla ( with taco portion of ingredients) was served in a pizza box! Carne asada looked like pork just terrible discoloration on it!  So we asked for our money back and left! I mean what did we expect going into a whole in the wall place, but there are many whole in the wall places I'd rather give my money too! Never again!"}
{"text":"Terrible bland tasting food, poor customer service, skimpy portions. Don't waste your time coming here, you're better off going to KFC across the way."}
{"text":"I should have checked the review, by far the worst Mexican restaurant in ever been in my life. Worst burrito ever, the torta had a wire.......yes a wire, the twisted wired inside the torta....incredible.  0 stars......"}
{"text":"No good at all meat on tacos overcook, guacamole was dark old,tortillas cold bad food :("}
{"text":"I really should have checked the reviews for this place before we came here. We ordered a carne asada burrito and a bowl of menudo, big mistake. The menudo was absolutely disgusting and full of grease. Once we decided this was not the place for us we went to wash our hands....wow. The bathroom looked like a war zone.   Just don't go here, period."}
{"text":"Oh how I wish there was a ZERO star to choose from. Was in the area and stopped in with friends to get a breakfast burrito. The cheese was processed, greasy, gross eggs! Took ONE bite and threw in trash! Restaurant is so DIRTY, I went to wash my hands in restroom..HORRENDOUS! Mold, broken faucet. This place needs the city to check their food safety. SCARY!"}
{"text":"California burrito was the worst I have ever had! Fries were hard and the carne asada had a weird taste. Breakfast burrito was even bland. Will never return! Yuck!!"}
{"text":"Carne Asada fries were pretty good. Way better than Filibertos. They use real guacamole and not that green soupy stuff."}
{"text":"Food was OK. But if I'm paying six dollars for a burrito I expected to be a little bit bigger than a tiny little one . Will not go back ever again because they are stingy with their food"}
{"text":"The food was just ok. I expect the cook to take a little more care when they are serving people who are dining in. The enchiladas weren't even melted. The cheese probably went straight from the bag to a cold tortilla."}
{"text":"This place was unexpectedly good. I pass it everyday and one day I went inside to try and was amazed. The food has flavor, the plates are huge and the price is unbelievable. Idk how this place only has two stars."}
