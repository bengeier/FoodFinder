{"text":"Over the years, Ive heard good things about this restaurant. I thought it would be like the former Mexican restaurant chain called Chi-Chi's. However, it is not. And I was sort of disappointed that it was a cross between a watering hole and a dive.  I ordered Chicken Enchiladas, which were nothing more than plain shredded chicken, rolled in a tortilla wrap--served with a small amount of lettuce, a sliver of tomato, and a teaspoon of sour cream.  Also, I ordered a side of Guacamole, and chips (since none of the entrees are served with sides, and all of the sides are a la carte). Basically, the Guacamole only consisted of mashed avocados without any additional seasonings.     The best thing about this Don Tequila restaurant was the fast, welcoming, and friendly service from the ONE Waiter/Host/Bartender/Cashier who constantly multitasked."}
{"text":"I love, love, love don tequila. I eat the chicken chimichangas. I am a margarita drinker, I think they are a little weak. My husband gets the shrimp fajitas and enjoys every bite. Not to mention the queso, which makes a great starter. It is very dark in the restaurant. All in all service is fast and friendly. We will return!!!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been going here every weekend for about 3 months straight, can't get enough of the Burrito Jalisco and their yummy chips with queso dip! Food is made super fast, very consistent quality, it's like they have a Mexican robot chef in the kitchen.   And our favorite waiter, Ivan, is so sweet and refers to us as his friends. We will definitely miss this place when we move, please go and ask for Ivan!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best little Mexican place I have ever been to.  This place rocks from start  to finish.  The chips and salsa are great and aways plentiful, my favorite entree (burrito durango - ordered spicy), and even the fried ice cream are always better than can be expected.  The employees always make you feel welcomed and try to make some conversation with you.  I think they even laughed a bit at me when they noticed I was there twice in the same weekend.  A direct result of two different out of town guests wanting to go back.  Like I was gonna refuse.  Anyway, GO TRY THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times. Each time makes me long for a real Mexican resturant.  A lunchtime crowd is a good indication of good food. The good news is you will always find a seat here no matter the time of day.  I always leave here hungry. The portions are always meager. The food reminds me of a high school home ec student trying to copy from memory a meal he had when he was in grade school. Maybe it's difficult to find authentic ingredients in Northern Ohio. Or maybe it's because so few people here have ever had a really good Mexican meal that let's the cooks just loaf along and not try harder.  Chips and salsa are served before your meal. The salsa is bland and tastes like it's canned. The chips are hard and dry, almost stale.  The enchiladas are very small. The sauce on top is boring and barely there.   There are very few Mexican resturants in Medina. Pity. A good one would put this one out of business."}
{"text":"So I'm sitting with some dude whos wearing a spider hat eating chips and salsa... sipping on a soda - Mountain Dew flavored - waiting on my chimis to arrive.   Then all of a sudden the heavens part and who slips in the booth next to me?  It's none other than Mike Carlson.  \"No thanks,\" he says passing on food, \"I'll just have a soda in one of those glass bottles, lemon/lime if you will.\"  SpiderHat pours him his own individual bowl of little salsa to avoid cross contamination and Carlson sits and munches - periodically drinking from his bottle from his oh so kissable lips.   As I sit silently eating my scrumptious chicken chimis - I listen to SpiderHat and him discuss Carlson's most current girlfriend and how he took her to see Eclipse.   If only I was lucky enough to attend the latest Twilight movie on the arm of a man like Carlson.... Or perhaps even the grace the dead bodies opened up for science display followed by a romantic dinner of grilled cheese at the Melt.  But alas, I guess this girl is just gonna have to dream.    Oh yah - and there's some pretty freakin' good Mexican food at this place."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant. Never got anything bad here. Food is reasonably priced and always comes out to the table fast."}
{"text":"After living in San Diego, CA for a few years I know good Mexican food when I taste it and Don Tequila is great Mexican food for an even better price.  Like many great Mexican restaurants I've been to, the place looks seemingly like a hole in the wall from the outside but the interior has a vibrant and colorful decor. Good service with great food makes for an awesome experience. Definitely worth checking out if you are looking for decent Mexican food for cheap in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Best mexican in Medina! My husband and I have tried every mexican restaurant in Medina and this is by far the best. It is the best food and the best price. Plus their margaritas are delicious!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst Mexican Restaurants I have ever eaten at. I love Mexican food and have been to a variety of establishments. I opted Chipotle for some \"authentic\" Mexican food and that was a dissapointment. I walked in around 2:30p and the place was empty, should have been a sign. I didn't even look at the menu because I always order El Camarones a la Diabla. I ordered the aforementioned with guacamole. My main meal didn't come with tortillas, and it was not at all spicy. The rice was dry, and the salad combination it came with was miniscule. The guacamole was horrendous. It was runny and bland. The chips and salsa were a dissapointment as well. The salsa had no substance, and was runny as well. In my eyes this was very unaccpetable and I wish I would have just went to Chipotle..."}
{"text":"Pretty sub-par Mexican but I have had some decent meals here. It always looks like it's closed because for some reason they seat everyone in the back. If they sat people in the front windows the place might actually look alive."}
{"text":"Delicious food, pitchers of margaritas, ultra-cheap prices, and a soft-spoken waiter that looks kinda' like Joaquin Phoenix. What else could you ask for? Perhaps a sombrero and a nice rendition of \"feliz cumpleanos\" for your birthday? Because they'll do that, too.   This is authentic Mexican at its best. Now, I was hesitant at first. I'll be honest, the rest of the mall where the restaurant is located is a bit run-down... But I promise,  Don Tequila's is bright, clean, delicious and cheap.  Suggestions: Margaritas (of course), cheese quesedillas (whatever they fry these in is divine), and beef tacos."}
{"text":"Very good mexican! Good chips, salsa and menu. Can't go wrong! Fajitas are delicious!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant.  Food is fresh and hot.  Fast, attentive service. Very consistent every visit."}
{"text":"I've lived in Chicago, New York, Seattle... and I still look forward to coming home to Medina so I can eat at Don Tequila. There are two kinds of Mexican food I've found, gourmet Mexican ($10+/tapas/etc.) and your working-class Mexican (taco truck style/ street Mexican). Don Tequila is the latter and without a doubt the best I've come across anywhere. Even when I've found comparable food, it's never been as cheap and in as large quantity as Don's. For the price, you're not going to find better authentic Mexican food. The cherry on the proverbial deep-fried ice cream however, is the staff. Go here 2 or 3 times in the same month and they will know your name, what you usually order, ask you how your mother's doing...:)"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Don Tequila on Green Road. I was in the mood for tacos and they are close to my house. I'm of the opinion that a \"real\" taco just includes a perfectly grilled meat along with chopped onions and cilantro, all wrapped up in a double, lightly fried corn tortilla. So, I asked the waiter for three simple \"tacos de carnitas.\" I was thrilled with the tacos. The pork was amazing - hand pulled with crispy edges and great spice. There was lots of meat, too. I just added a little lime juice and some hot tomatillo salsa to make some of the best tacos I've had since living in Chicago. I agree with other reviews that the chips and salsa aren't special. I'm guessing that all the pork dishes are good if they use the same pulled pork I had.  I also sampled the tilapia tacos and they were good, but nothing to rave about. I'll go back, for sure. Thanks for the nice service, too! I would recommend trying Don Tequila's."}
{"text":"My friends and I discovered this sadly only in our senior year of college.  However, the legacy still lives on.    The food is pretty decent and seriously, from the time your server walks away with your order until the time you get your food: TIME IT.  Anything will come out in less than 4 minutes, how they do it I don't know.   Try not to fill up on chips and salsa before hand, because they keep them coming.    The pitchers of margaritas are also a deal at $13.00 for a couple of different flavors.    My only downside, my burrito is usually like $4.50, however for some reason it makes me mad that the guac is an additional $2.50.   I still always get it though."}
{"text":"We've been coming here at least four times per month for the last 11 years. Hands down best restaurant in town as far as cost, quality of food and sevice."}
{"text":"Stopped in last Sunday with some friends. I think it's always interesting to see what kind of crowds are in a Mexican restaurant on a Sunday evening because that tells me something about the restaurant. Don Tequila's had a fairly nice crowd. Maybe the $2.50 lime margaritas had something to do with it, but, if it does, that's just good marketing on their part. Lots of Mexican restaurants I've been to would be hard pressed to cover their costs on Sundays.  The $2.50 lime margaritas are good. Try one. I also enjoyed the salsa, presented in small carafes with everyone getting their own small bowel so there is no worry about double dipping. And I was perfectly satisfied with my 3 enchilada dinner. Don't remember what it was called but it came with one cheese enchilada, one ground beef enchilada and one chicken enchilada, each covered in a different sauce. And the customary rice and beans. I was able to substitute the chicken for pork with no difficulty, and I am happy I did. The pork was seared nicely to bring out the flavor and was probably the best enchilada of the three.  The people I was with thought the food was only O.K. I thought it was better than O.K. And the staff was friendly and helpful.  Don Tequila is a \"sister\" to Patrons in Wadsworth. While I liked Don Tequila I would probably chose to return to Patron's if I'm with my same friends. After all, I did give Patron's 5-stars."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends. The food was bland and was distasteful. The salsa taste and looks like it is store bought. They put us in a room with kids. They were playing a music video which was very innapropreate. The bathroom handles were slimy and had a weird texture on it. The staff was also rude and had not correct conduct. They kept on putting their hands in my sister's hair. With me they kept on patting me on the back like I did something cool. I thought that they liked both me and my sister. I would highly suggest thinking before going."}
{"text":"If I could give it a zero, I would.  When this place first opened and Pablo was manager, it was very good.  After him and his wife left, the place went down hill fast.  Poor food and worse margaritas.  Not planning on going back."}
{"text":"Don tequila is dangerously close to my house. I love the fact that their food is always reliable. The servers are efficient and kind. Delicious fresh salsa and hot chips make it hard to not go more often. Hands down, this is my favorite go-to Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"first when to this place in my home town Lorain ohio, then i found out there are more then one in the area, so just went to the one in medina ohio, the food was awesome and the environment was nice and the food got to our table fast and super hot. i would go back here anytime and i plan on it."}
{"text":"First, I will say that Mexican food is high on my list!  Love it!  Plus, I was born & raised in Southern CA., where GOOD mexican restaurants are a dime a dozen.  In northeast Ohio, however, not so much.  Since having moved here in the mid-90's, I've tried many different Mexican restaurants, but  - so far, have found only 3 that are worth your time & money.  These include....(in no particular order)......  - Cozumel (which has 4 locations in this region).  - Mallorca (in downtown Cleveland)  - and, I'm glad to add DON TEQUILA to this short list.  The first thing I noticed about Don Tequila Restaurant, was the nice easy-going atmosphere, with cantina music playing in the background, and a Very friendly, welcoming staff.  So, I already liked this place. ;)   Within 1 minute of being seated, a friendly server came up with chips & salsa, and asked what we would like to drink. ((Bonus points!)) We ordered drinks, and then - at another nearby table, a group of employees began gathering around, clapping & kickin' up some energy..... Their server placed this HUGE sombrero on one girl's head, and they all sang \"Happy birthday\" to her.  Now, obviously, this is nothing new in many restaurants, but here was a group of family & friends having a good time together, and apparently, the 'birthday girl' chose this restaurant at which to celebrate her special day. And, unlike some restaurants where the staff are obviously thinking: \"Ohhhh great, another birthday. Let's hurry up 'n sing this damn song again so we can get on with our lives\"..... the staff who were around that table (which was about 5-6 people), genuinely appeared to be having Fun with the group, sang well, and wished her a happy birthday.   Ya know, it's just good to see moments when even strangers can make a nice difference to someone on a special occasion. :)   But, OK, back to my own experience.....  So, my date and I decided to order the steak fajitas for two. We had a very good time, and the place wasn't too loud, so we could have a conversation without having to shout.  And, within 15 minutes, our food came out, still sizzling....everything looked and tasted great.....the tortillas were warm, and they brought salsa dishes to the table.... Very impressed.   As for thr food, itself, everything on our plates (including the steak, rice, refried beans, sour cream, fresh lettuce, guacamole, etc), was Great.  Our server checked back a couple of times to see that everything was good, and asked if wanted anything more..... Very friendly.....Great atmosphere.....  I will definitely be back. Afterall, these kinda places are few & far between around here. ;)"}
{"text":"Last night's dinner at Don Tequila was probably the worst dining experience of my life.  It all started with the water that tasted like it was tapped from a sewer.  The chips were cold and stale.  The cheese quesadilla was downright disgusting.  I was embarrassed that I took someone there for dinner.  I will NEVER go back.  DISGUSTING!!!!"}
{"text":"Agree with the 0 rating comment already posted. No liquor in the margaritas and food was not good. Zero chance of returning."}
{"text":"I am giving it three .5 stars because I am from the great Republic of Texas and we are Tex-Mex and BBQ snobs.  See, I will own it.    Now, this is not Tex-Mex but for what Ohio, and just about every other state that is not Texas has to offer, it is not bad.    So I had to piece together a typical Texas meal, one taco, two cheese enchiladas, a tamale.    The taco was typical and seriously lacked beef.  TB would be better.  The enchiladas has the brown gravy with white Mexican cheese.  It is okay, but if they were to put chili sauce and onions on it they would score big.  Upside they did use corn tortillas, which is correct.  I have seen some place serve it with flour.  That is s burrito.  I think they do that to laugh at the customers.  Noe the tamale came with sauce and cheese.  This is not normal...but I liked it a lot.  See, you can teach and old dog.  Normally they would have some mole sauce, but n this case, their tangy brown gravy worked great.  The tamale itself was perfect.  Not dry and had great seasoned pork without having to much f the corn maze.  Worth a stand alone dish.  Only tip I have is when you get their table salsa you should add some of the habanero sauce to give it some flavor.  Service was great.   So go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Short staffed, had to wait a few to get seated.  Floor was a little dirty.  They were out of fried ice cream and Flan."}
{"text":"Best around.  Just wish they would have more authentic dishes since they do so well with the typical fare."}
{"text":"As far standard Mexican places go, this place is the best. I love the Chile Verde and my main squeeze likes the pollo con crema."}
{"text":"I work close by so Don Tequila is an easy place to get lunch. It seems every time we order here, something is messed up.  For instance, today we ordered 3 orders of chips with queso cheese dip, got the wrong order and they charged $16 for that.  The food is bland and not very good. Save yourself the money and time and go to either El Patron in Seville or Casa del Rio in Wadsworth."}
{"text":"Nice Mexican restaurant..  The food is good and have a wide selection.  Fast service and friendly staff.  Keep in mind there are no free refills on soda.  The place is hard too find.  it is located in the corner of a shopping plaza near the Sears store."}
{"text":"Ew, I would have actually preferred taco bell. The enchiladas, chile relleno, and burritos were really greasy and bland. They had 2 different radio stations playing and the lighting was poor. Not going back."}
{"text":"The problem that most reviewers have for this place is that they don't know what authentic Mexican food is. Taco Bell, Chipotle, and all those other chain restaurants are generic and Americanized Mexican food.  On that note coming from a Mexican, this is the closest I can get from not cooking it myself. Atmosphere is kinda dark but there's privacy in the booths so you don't have to put up with over hearing others conversation. Now there are TONS of different ways to make salsa and I like the one here because it has a small kick to it and it isn't chunky or too salty. Food is pretty good, rice is dry at times but that's no problem, I've had worse. Additionally, the food isn't greasy at all. (Greasy is when you go to a taco truck and you get the first taco after they just oiled up the grill and once you pick it up the grease drips onto your other tacos and runs down your hands. Now THATS greasy but it adds flavor in my opinion, so no complains here.) Service is great too! They always treat me like family when I come in, attentive and quick to refill my drink no matter how busy they are. So whenever I'm not in the mood to cook and I'm in ohio, then this is the place to go for a taste of home."}
{"text":"Though we had prompt service our service slowly deteriorated. Since it was my sisters birthday I dealt with it. The Camarones that I ordered were burnt and the waiter  kept saying there weren't when even on lookers agreed. I don't know why this place is open considering Los Habeneros is down the road with better service and food."}
{"text":"My husband and I usually find that we can eat cheaper and better here than at Chipotle.  The service is always friendly and I've never had a problem with the food.  The portions are huge, and they give you chips of course.  Even if you get carryout, they still give you a ton of chips.  One meal from this place tends to last for two, easily."}
{"text":"I tried to use an Entertainment Book coupon for 'buy one, get one' entree.  The cashier said it can't be used for a vegetarian entree.  WHAT?!  It is an ENTREE.  It cost the same amount as a meat entree.  It was listed under \"ENTREES\".  There was also no wordage noting \"screw you vegetarian\" on the coupon. Wouldn't have pissed me off so much if the cashier wasn't so \"F-- you\" about it. Not going back.   El Charrito is better, anyhow!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Medina. Good prices and a great quesadilla fajita!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Couldn't disagree with other reviewers more! We eat here about once a month and always have impeccable service. The cheesy decor adds to the experience in my opinion. Food is above average. I especially love the chile rellenos--even better than the ones at Zocalo on E 4th. Chips and salsa are awesome, taste homemade. And the margaritas are good--and cheap, particularly if you get there before 7 or 7:30. Great value too!"}
{"text":"I hate Americanized Mexican.  This place is just like alla the resta them. Huge, obnoxious menu. Ugly, sticky venue. Dry, pukey rice. All at a cheap price. Everything looks and tastes the same. Super, mother-effing lame. Jumbo margs that taste like ass. Next time, I'll surely pass."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant.  I'd say I dine here at least once a week, maybe more.  I usually order the #29 which is 2 hard  beef tacos, a chicken enchilada and a beef burrito.  Other times I'll order the crab enchiladas, and a taco.  My boyfriend orders the #11 which is a beef burrito, beef enchilada and hard beef taco, and an additional order (an order is 3) of hard beef tacos.  The meat isn't very spicy, and they use a red sauce or a white sauce.  The red sauce is spicy, but not overly so.  The white sauce I've only had with crab enchiladas, and it's very good, and not spicy at all.  The chips and salsa are very good, but sometimes the salsa can be a bit spicy.  Try the cheese dip; it's not nearly as spicy and is delicious as well.  The waiters are always polite and attentive, and will recognize you if you come in enough.  My boyfriend and I will usually spend around $23 here, and that includes two sodas, two combination dinners, cheese dip and an extra order of hard beef tacos.  The plaza where Don Tequila's is located has seen better days, but it's safe and just looks a little run-down.  It's usually very busy during the day, and early evening.  Overall, I love Don Tequila's and eat here often!"}
{"text":"Umm it's alright I'm not a big fan of Mexican  it's alot better than the restraints I have has before it's not bad and there really quick with there food that's a good thing its not the best food in the world but its decent and very professional very quiet a nice spot for a family to bring there kids.. as well."}
{"text":"Great meal very good prices.  Kid friendly. I had just chicken soft tacos they were 5.99 and fantastic.  Will go back"}
{"text":"Just as it's supposed to be - unpretentious, good, and affordable.  The place isn't much for ambiance, but I don't want it to be. The food at Don Tequila never disappoints. Good portions, good service... what else can you ask for? I love taking my family here. Everyone can get what they want in their extensive menu (without having to worry about price) and everyone is always full. So great to have a place like this in our own neighborhood. We look forward to coming back many more times."}
{"text":"Great restaurant I have been going there since I was 3 and I have never not enjoyed my self there.       By far one of my most favorite restaurants I have been to.Great food and the waiters are like family to me"}
{"text":"The food is ok but the service is sub-par. Just had a horrible take out experience. How is a chicken and steak burrito the same as three beef tacos.  It was a take out order so  course I didn't see the problem until I got home. This is not the same as forgetting a taco or forgetting to put cheese on the taco.  Not happy at all with this type of service.  I was basically ripped off since I paid for what I ordered and got something completely different in the end.   They just lost one customer and they may lose more if they don't change.  Update....After speaking with the manager about what happen, he acknowledge that they messed up. He explained my order was mixed up with another customer's order and he talked with his staff about better checking of orders before taking them out to customers. They are back on good terms with me."}
{"text":"Service and food were both good. My wife had a wet pork burrito and I had the chorizo tacos. Definitely a solid experience."}
{"text":"Just went back for dinner Saturday night.  The place was not crowded - assuming the lack of JCU students is responsible for that.  However, the food was as good as we have ever had at DT.  They must have hired a cook who knows what he is doing back there, because our food was outstanding.  Muy bien!"}
{"text":"Epic fail. Multiple epic fails.  1 hanging light is right in your face. 2.  Tacos have less flavor than taco bell. Same with everything else. 3 Puke lined toilets 4.Shots are served in thimbles 5. Margaritas were lime mixer with no liqueur 6. No bar  If you really think this place is good then you know nothing about real Mexican food. This was one of the worst places I have eaten at ever.  To compare this place to Taco Bell is an insult to Taco Bell. Just absolute garbage.   Justin I am baffled that you gave this place 2 stars.  This will make my list of death traps"}
{"text":"Even with a party of 20, they accommodated us with a smile.  I've never had a bad meal here, and the service is always pleasant.  They'll make you wear a sombrero on your birthday, but it's okay.  No one will stare at you when they sing the birthday song loudly and clap and cheer for you.  Okay, everyone will stare.    But, you won't mind, since you just drank that monster margarita."}
{"text":"You'll find me here when I'm craving cheap, no-nonsense Mexican food. I've been here too many times to admit but the service is always consistently great. I always get the same thing: fajitas. The portion is huge and it's so so cheap. They even have a \"fajitas for dos\" if you're into sharing. The mixed vegetables and meat come out sizzlin' and the best part is it isn't toooo greasy like what you may expect. They will always bring out mas tortillas so you can take the rest home. The margs are decent and yup, cheap. Great for group fiestas. ¡Olé!"}
{"text":"I just moved back to Ohio after 6 years in Tucson, Az. I was hopeful about trying this place with reviews talking about the homemade salsa and chips. I was let down by the salsa first.  Tomatoes, a little bit of onion and a few pieces of cilantro. I wasn't looking for fire but a slight medium kick and some flavor would have been nice. The rice was, OK. I got a beef quesadilla which was good but, extremely small. A small flour tortilla folded in half. The shredded beef in it was fantastic.  My taco was in a shell you get from the grocery store with a couple hints of cheese.  I asked about what kind of tamales they had. Waiter said \"carnitas\", which I love. But, I was afraid to try after the salsa and seeing their gray guacamole.  I get that I'm in Ohio now. But, this food was way off the mark. The waiter was very nice and attentive. The prices are typical of a Mexican restaurant. The place needs the ceiling redone due to neons that look to have burnt it and water spots everywhere. But, it was clean."}
{"text":"Food is nothing to rave about. My taco salad had broccoli and cauliflower in it... However, fun atmosphere to get margaritas with friends. Nachos & other appetizers all seem pretty normal."}
{"text":"Don Tequila is right next door to Happy Buddha, and has way more space inside! If you wanted to take a group, that is not a problem. In addition to the booths they have up front, there are several (6-ish) rows of tables in the back each able to sit about 6 people.   I've had the chicken enchiladas the few times that we have been, and they aren't bad. Which is to say, that they were a-ok in my book (I've had a lot worse in the Midwest). *Side note - I almost ordered something else this time, but after speaking with the waiter and learning that the \"beef\" enchilada would in fact be ground beef, I passed. If I wanted ground beef taco/burrito/enchilada/etc. I would just go to a fast food place, or make it myself. Come-on - you have all day to prep, slow cook a side of cow and shred it up!  The chicken is slow cooked with peppers and onions, then shredded. It has great flavor. The cheese and sauce could have been a little cheesier and saucier, but at least it didn't taste bad! The rice and beans are good as well. The pricing is standard for plate dinners. The salsa had a nice kick to it that built over time, but wasn't too much that I couldn't give my toddler a little."}
{"text":"I grew up further south and I think if I were still living there I would give this place three stars but I had to bump up one because it is difficult to find good Mexican food in Cleveland. The decor is fairly standard for little Mexican joints. It was clean.   The service was prompt and the waiter very accommodating. Several people have mentioned the salsa and although it is not my favorite style of salsa there was nothing intrinsically wrong with it. I found it to be perfectly adequate as an appetizer.  Where this place shined for me was the entree. At the suggestion of the waiter I ordered the burrito Durango, which has several meats and is covered in a spicy chili mole. It was quite good. I would definitely order it again.  The prices were also more than fair with a large amount of food coming at a pretty cheap price. If your looking for some descent Mexican food then this is a great option."}
{"text":"so i go to the one in mentor all the time no issues, its one of my favorite dining spots. so i go to the willoughby location expecting the same.....not gonna happen. i go in there and i ask if they still have the all you can eat taco special they have on mondays. the waitress points to the ala carte menu and some other stuff not answering my question, i ask again and she said yes. i order my tacos. no lettuce, and no cheese. they come...the moment of truth.....theres lettuce and cheese on em...i said politely that i ordered em with no lettuce or cheese...just meat....round 2...what happens....theres cheese on em. clearly they can no follow instructions. oh yeah, it wasint all you can eat tacos like the waitress said.   the tacos were good. i came in hungry and i left hungry."}
{"text":"Really awful margaritas.  Food is good, but there are so many Americanized Mexican restaurants to choose from, there's just no excuse for a horrible margarita.  My wife and I tried both the \"standard\" level and the \"gold\" level and they both sucked.  Standard was bland and awful, gold was syrupy and awful.  Other than that, it was really fantastico!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mexican restaurant! Great food, consistent quality, great atmosphere, friendly staff. Wonderful place to bring the family. We drive 40 minutes on a regular basis to eat here!"}
{"text":"Great cheap Mexican food! The margaritas are refreshing and very tasty. The decor is fun to look at too. We have been here three times and are always very satisfied with our meals. When we are craving Mexican food this is our go to local spot."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Mexican fare. Three stars for the food and an extra star for value. Would not hesitate to eat here again but wouldn't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"I love this place! Right around the corner, it's has a cozy and fun atmosphere. Their service is terrific and the food is to die for. Try the creamy crab app, your mouth will thank you! the drinks are a bit watered down, so dont bother."}
{"text":"Excellent mexican menu! Have been eating here for years and the food never disappoints. No matter what is ordered, it's always served quickly! C'mon! Try them, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets. Great food with authentic taste. Staff is nice and friendly.   My favorite is Burrito Durango: 12\" tortilla wrapped in shrimp, beef and chicken with peppers and onion. Topped with tomatillo sauce and cheese.  Beautiful deco and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great local rather loco spot. Great service, Food has never been bad, and the margaritas are good for the price. I suggest a pitcher if you are with 3 or more people. Food wise the enchiladas are killer, fajitas no matter what kind are very good and the Pollo Con Crema is perfect."}
{"text":"I don't necessarily have anything bad to say about it except that I don't really like whatever cheese they use in the cheese enchilada, but I am picky about cheese.  Overall, the food is pretty good, I love the salsa, and the service is good.  And the prices are good!  Great happy hour prices."}
{"text":"After experiencing a not so good visit at another Mexican restaurant I thought I should leave a review for this one...  I've been going to Don Tequila's for about 10 years and have never been disappointed. The service is always great, the food is always great and the prices are great. Even on a busy night, it is great. The place really is just...you guessed it, great! I recently moved from Medina to about 45 min away and will be making the drive to Medina to enjoy this place. It is my fav and always will be...."}
{"text":"If Don Tequilas were a woman, she would be beautiful and play bass in a post-punk band. Men would watch her from afar, too intimidated by her intrinsic beauty to approach her and ask for her hand in marriage. Women would quarrel and gossip about her out pure jealousy. And she would make excellent margaritas and bring me lots of chips. I love, you Don Tequilas."}
{"text":"Weekday lunch-time with a crowd of perhaps six other diners....there's usually a reason for a lot of empty seats in a restaurant at meal-time and it usually isn't something from which the diner will benefit. Let's start with the good stuff. Service, chips and salsa, prices and promptness were all perfectly fine. Long lines, no chips or salsa, relatively high prices and obnoxious treatment at the hands of the chef.&/or help can all be overlooked if the food is good enough, (remember Seinfeld's \"soup Nazi\"?  But what does one have when the food just ain't up to par? Based upon other reviews I've read, a lot of people seem to love the food here; for both me and my wife....not so much. We both got combination plates, mine had a beef burrito, tamale, and quesadilla. Sounds like a lot doesn't it?......not so much! The tamale is THE dish by which a Mexican restaurant can usually be judged without anything else touching one's fork.  Making a good one is no mean task.  I tried once and after hours of work, tossed the result in the garbage.   Given a choice of the ones I tossed  versus the one I was served here, I would pick mine without so much as a moment's hesitation!   Again, the ones I made were terrible, but these folks served me the equivalent of a wet oblong corn meal muffin without the sweetness, the caramelized edges and the pleasant consistency that typically accompany the muffin. Just a sodden clay-like culinary error. After the first bite, I found myself picking the leaden crust off of the half-ounce or so of chicken or pork inside, (dunno which) and was rewarded by a small, single flavorless bite of flesh of unknown origin.  The minute amount of sauce that accompanied it did little to dress up that component of the meal as it had been sopped up en toto by the nasty cornmeal wrapping.   The quesadilla was the standard flour tortilla filled with a modest amount of queso, (the world's mildest cheese), grilled  sans seasoning, so not exactly an express trip to Flavortown, and lastly the burrito was dressed in a flour taco-sized shell, (shelf your expectations that the size will even APPROACH the size of a Taco Bell burrito of any variety.)  Happily, the meal did not have rice or beans as an accompaniment, as these components seem to lack any discernible flavor beyond that of....well beans and rice, regardless of where they are served.  Kinda the Mexican equivalent of un-buttered store-bought white bread.  My wife had the beef enchilada and beef burrito with... drum roll please...beans and rice. Let's assume the beans and rice tasted like unadorned beans and rice, she was about as thrilled with the major two components of her entrée as me. I'm thinking the key to enjoying one's meal here has a lot to do with the margarita &/or beer specials they have and not so much with the food. If you aren't drinking on a particular day when Mexican food comes to mind, Medina has a Tres Potrillos across from the Buehler's on Rte 18.  Hands down a better choice for decent Mexican food and only a mile or two away from these folks."}
{"text":"I had just gotten a raise and decided to treat me and my girlfriend to a nice late lunch. I have had arrozz camarones at another place and it is my favorite dish. I tried it at fiesta jalapeños and other places up north. This was the best. And plus I didn't know what the Texas margarita was, it's a must banging!  Gracie's Carlos!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night at Don Tequila.  Since it was my first time eating here, I had to go with the fajitas.  My wife and I split the Texas fajitas for two and they were delicious.  The shrimp, beef, and chicken were tender and juicy, as were the mushrooms, onions, and green peppers.  We loved em!  They were definitely on par with Cozumel, our favorite Mexican restaurant.  The salsa was a little bland, but easily spiced up with the hot sauce sitting on the table.   I had a large mango margarita, which was tasty, but didn't sport as much alcohol as I'm used to.  It was still very good frozen, nonetheless.  I'd visit again!"}
{"text":"Really good place for Mexican food. The staff is very friendly and helps with ordering. Queso Fundido is awesome!! Fajitas are very popular here although I have never ordered them. Margaritas are some of the best in Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service. We see Ricardo every week.. He's sweet and always remembers EVERYTHING. Love the food and happy hour from 4-7:30 Monday through Thursday. Yum!"}
{"text":"Came out for dinner and drinks- and the service was so horrible that we were only able to be offered one margarita in the 1.25 hour wait for the food to arrive.  Plan on at least two hours for dinner and a lot of waiting, and lies about how long until your food arrives.  Will not be coming back here again- management was notified and didn't do anything about it either.  Just claimed they are busy- clearly, but shouldn't take more than an hour to make tacos."}
{"text":"I love it here! Its like I'm actually in mexico, and the service is amazing. Not to mention the food is great! I highly recomend it."}
{"text":"An OK place. I've tried several things on the menu and nothing has thrilled me. The staff always seems slightly distracted. My wife prefers the margaritas here to the drinks at Jalapeno Loco. I'd rate the food about equal."}
{"text":"Delish little hole in the wall. It's hard to find good, cheap Mexican food in Cleveland and I was pleasantly surprised by the margaritas and the spicy carne asada. My whole party was happy with their meals, ranging from burritos to enchiladas to special platters. Will be back!"}
{"text":"First time here. I see right outside are the daily specials. Very very good prices. Complimentary toasted chips and salsa. Very warm atmosphere and smooth music. The food came out very quick and hot. I ordered one of the combination dinners that consisted of a beef burrito, beef enchilada, and a quesadilla. All very good. I read another review that mentioned the combo meals aren't very much food. After eating it, I would say for the price, it is good. You shouldn't be too hungry after and not too full either.Looks little from the outside but it has good room on the inside, and the service was alright overall. I would come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty good and cheap. Food is very consistent. Wait staff is a bit slow in understanding and pretty bad with English."}
{"text":"This is our favorite family Mexican spot. Service is always good and the food is tasty.  What I like is not on the menu so they make it special for me.  It's loud enough that my kids don't embarrass me but not so loud you can't enjoy your meal.  There is a pretty big space off the side of the restaurant that only recently realized was more seating so we NEVER have to wait for a table. Most importantly... the margaritas are fantastic!!!"}
