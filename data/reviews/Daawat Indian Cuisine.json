{"text":"we tried paneer butter masala, garlic naan here its really worth it for the given price and lady is courteous. they also integrated with ubereats hence 5 stars"}
{"text":"One of the good restaurant in Phoenix for Indians.  Even for Americans who likes spicy food."}
{"text":"Love this place. Has become our goto takeout joint on those lazy/too busy weekends.   My wife is a vegetarian and I am carnivorous so this is the perfect compromise. I even enjoy the vegetarian options.  I have yet to sit in for a meal, but when I picked up my order I noticed that it's clean, quite and cozy. Looking forward to stopping in for a meal."}
{"text":"Frequently i wil go to this place. Nice food. Mianly the biryani was awesome. Try badam milk here, its very nice."}
{"text":"today afternoon i had Non -veg lunch special and chicken manchuria both were awesome im addicting to daawat... thank you for bring good food to this valley"}
{"text":"The best Indian food in the Valley.  So glad we found it.  Go with the onion pakora, biryani, lamb vindaloo.  Nothing disappoints."}
{"text":"We ordered Briyani couple of times and taste is very very good. Badam milk is yummy. Over all ambience is good and meat  are properly cooked"}
{"text":"Great little spot.  No frills, just awesome food.  Superb flavors and spices.  I would highly recommend this spot for a great meal.  I had the Chicken Special Byrani and the Aoloo Gobi with garlic naan bread!  Fantastic, I was in food heaven,  This is my spot from now on.  The service was excellent as well.  Must put on your food list."}
{"text":"I got to know about this new place a few weeks back and decided to go for lunch there. To be honest I went there with no expectations as it is a new place no reviews small place etc and ordered an andhra chicken curry and butter naan.... To my surprise I have not had this kind of delicious chicken curry in last few years the masala was not very thick or thin the chicken was so soft that it was breaking in my hand everything was soooo right and I am a big food critic and generally end up writing something bad but this time I did not get a chance even the naan was so fresh that it needs a separate mention"}
{"text":"I seek out Indian cuisine wherever I go and this restaurant deserves all the stars it can get. I've tried, two times I've been there, 5 different dishes (vegetarian) and each one was superbly delicious. So happy I found this little jewel. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Indian food."}
{"text":"Today we had chicken & mutton biryanies along with chilli chicken & chicken 65. The biryani tastes very nice and reminded me of Hyderabadi biryani. The best biryani place in the valley"}
{"text":"I've had most of the menu and nothing has disappointed. The chicken 65 is easily the best in Valley and is among my all-time favorite dishes right now. The inside is nothing fancy, but the prices and service easily offset the lack of decor. I've been waiting for a good place like this somewhere other than the east valley. Oh yeah, and you can get it delivered."}
{"text":"I haven't taste this kind of worst food ever .... please don't goto this restaurant.... I ordered chicken lollipop... it's look shit...... please dnt eat this even though they recommend for free....."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical about trying this place out as there was only 2 reviews about this place telling me that this had just opened not to long ago. I was pleasantly surprised and delighted with my experience. I had the Chicken Korma, Sag Aloo and a Regular Nann. It was spot on. The flavors of the dishes were really good and what i expect from an Indian Restaurant. The reason for the 4 stars is this place is a take out type of place or a Fast Indian Food restaurant. If you eat in as I did they do not serve you on any diner plates or Bowls. They serve they're food in styrofoam Plates and styrofoam Bowls.   If you can look past the styrofoam your in for a treat. They are really nice people and like I said before the food is great. They have only been open for 2 weeks and I hope they are around for a long while."}
{"text":"Recently moved in the area. Did some research on yelp and passed up the Saffron because the prices are high and you have to pay for rice and naan separate from the entree.  Usually the entrees come with rice at least.  Was pleasantly surprised that Daawat was right down the street and had more reasonable prices. I'm glad I made the effort to drive another 3 minutes.   Ordered the chicken tiika Marsala with plain rice and naan. This tiika Marsala was very tasty with just the right amount of spice. I am interested in trying out different dishes in the future.   The decor is nothing fancy inside and it appears that if you dine in you get served with styrofoam dinnerware. None of that bothers me, I am most interested in the taste of the food and the price. Daawat meets both these requirements.   My favorite Indian/Pakistani restaruant is located a long drive away in Tempe (curry corner). Looks like I will get my curry fix a lot more often since Daawat is right down the street!"}
{"text":"We ordered mutton biriyani for a gathering. Biriyani was yummy and tasted good. Mutton was well cooked and the rice was tasty."}
{"text":"Naans are very thik and will not recommend at all and every thing else taste just Ok. Nothing which you cant beat outside.."}
{"text":"I ordered biryani plate and was disappointed with the meat to rice ratio. I found about 6 pieces of meat in an entire to-go box of rice. Rice is super cheap and I paid $11 for a plate of rice practically. The food is delicious nonetheless. This is also the first time I have ever ordered from this restaurant. Perhaps they were just low on the meat I ordered at the time? Idk."}
{"text":"First time here and loved it. Had a paneer Dosa. It was delicious. It came with three different sauces? I don't know what they are called all I can say is I loved them all."}
{"text":"I ordered for chicken biryani and it was really good. Atleast as compare to any other places in Phoenix. Taste wise it was good, Chicken was properly cooked and same time it was not Greasy.  I will try this place again."}
{"text":"I am giving it 1 star because there is not an option to give a 0 . We got kadhai paneer,and daal curry with butter Naan. It was the worst food we ever had. I will never visit this place again and will never suggest it to anyone. So disappointed."}
{"text":"First thing, I had much better food than here.   Now, I ordered Chicken Spl Biriyani once, it was NOT good at all. The rice tasted and felt like it was 3 days old, hard and sour. The chicken was cooked but the flavor wasn't. Same thing with Chicken 65 and Manchuria. They tasted so raw like the cooked chicken was mixed with non cooked sauce. Courtesy, not so good at all. I wanted to order for delivery, they suggested to go with UberEats because 0.3 miles more than their 2 miles is not affordable for them. Looking at all the reviews, I realized you have to experience yourself to know the real deal about a place. All 5*, 4* ratings, they just misled me."}
{"text":"Small joint, great food! Lamb biryani was excellent so was chicken kadai. Dosa is a bit heavier than I am used to but overall food and service gets a 5."}
{"text":"Warm greeting/good prices/ TASTY FOOD!  I picked up a Samosa for a snack yesterday  just before they close at 3pm, as I waited ( maybe 3-5 min) owner brought me a sample mango lassi to try:) Delicious! Small cozy, nothing fancy place but the energy the owners bring to it Shines! They care. I'll be back soon for a Masla Dosa, Mutter Paneer & more. Try them out its worth it!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place with good ambience then this is not the right one. However the food was delicious and the service was quick. Would definitely go back again to try more items."}
{"text":"over tender meat , tikka masala and butter hicken hardly had any flavor chicken had cartilage in it if u want a amazing indian meal go down the street to saffron at 43rd ave and union hills you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A nice restaurant.  Biriyani is very good. Dosa is also yummy. Owners are very good. We tried nan and chicKen makhani. That was tasty too. We usually have tea at the end also"}
{"text":"Not so good. I ordered takeout and they missed few items I ordered. I trusted it would be in the bag since the only job they have to perform is to get it right. Anyhow they are not so automatic, Americanized version, watered down masala, looks like a burned out crew at work."}
{"text":"I order shrimp biryani on yelp, I was given chicken. I need to start verifying my orders when I got to this places. Also the biryani was the worse I have ever had. It was plain, not full of flavour like biryani should. If you love biryani don't go here. There are other good ones around."}
{"text":"We got delivery from this place from uber eats.  On a Sunday afternoon when I wasn't feeling well, it was just the ticket.  Food was still hot when it arrived and it was all wonderful.  The naan had a great texture for dipping and my butter paneer was fantastic if maybe a little light on the actual paneer.  I would definitely eat here or order from them again."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem. Nice people, good food, relaxed atmosphere. Very small place, but I would highly recommend it for pick-up and a night in. Great flavors and none were over done or difficult meat to eat. Chicken Tikka and was average to good and the Chicken Makani was terrific."}
{"text":"Thankful for Indian Cuisines that are open until midnight, like Daawat! Open your heart to the beautiful marriage of traditional Indian spices and the creaminess of a coconut base, their curry can do me no wrong. I've been obsessed for a while now, go treat yourself!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim and so glad we did!  We had the Tandoori chicken, lamb kabab and vegetable curry.  Everything was very tasty!  We'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Once I ordered chicken dum biryani togo. When I opened the box i see the box full of rice with only one leg piece in it. When I call them and say I don't see any chicken in the biryani, the guy on the phone says ma'am if u order Chicken Dum Biryani u will only get one leg quarter. I did not see any leg quarter. I just saw a chicken leg piece with very less meat and all bone. Instead of apologizing the guy was arguing with me proving himself right. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Another hidden gem I found through yelp. This very modest eatery is located on 35th Av just north of Union Hills Drive, with a storefront that would give you an impression that it is just another run-of-the-mill strip mall ethnic eatery. But then there's the food! I ordered meat samoza for appetizer; the two that were served to me were  so generously stuffed with very well seasoned meat that I consumed only one (the other to bring home for later snacking) so that there will be room for the main order.  Next, I tried the humblest of dishes: daal curry; it was bursting with amazing flavor and came with a big serving of fragrant rice. I'm a big fan of garlic naan so I ordered that too, and they make a really amazing garlic naan here - freshly cooked and glistening with ghee, garlic, and herbs. The dishes are very reasonably priced, service is simple (you order at the counter), and the flavors of the food impressed me enough to make me decide to come again a second time to get take-out veggie and meat samosas, and yet another time to enjoy their chicken dhum biryani - all three visits within the span of a week even though this place is a bit of a drive for me."}
{"text":"I don't live in the area but it's worth the drive and I wish it was closer to me so I could be at this place more often! I placed a to go order for the Chicken Makhani (butter chicken) WOW it was delightful. The sauce was mild, creamy, warm and flavorful. I think the chicken was mostly dark meat, but they were nice tender meaty chunks and plenty of sauce, love that! I also ordered a side of vegetable samosas. Now if you aren't used to spicy food, or you're  sensitive to hot and spicy,  then you might want to consider a different appetizer. I'm not like most people, I love anything spicy, so if you love hot and spicy, you'll love these! I loved them! They might be the best spiciest samosas I've ever had. I can't wait to try more dishes on the menu!! There's plenty to choose from and everything sounds great. Prices are fair- I came after 5pm, but you can check out the lunch specials if you go earlier. The food is dynamite! I'm so happy I stopped in!"}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of biryani from many different places but this place takes the cake. One of the best dishes I've had and will come back as many times as I can while in town! Do yourself a favor and try the goat biryani or the lamb vindaloo. To die for!"}
{"text":"First visit. Take out. Staff was very friendly. Place was clean. Food was delicious. Tried my go to dish - Chicken Tikka Masala and one I never had before Achari Murgh... and some garlic naan. Tikka was excellent! Achari Murgh was new to me but I really liked it!  This place is more cost effective than the other Indian cuisine spots in the area and IMHO taste better as well. I will be back."}
{"text":"We were in the area and this place has a great review from Yelp!, so we went in expecting great food.  We had the mixed pakoras (crispy vegetable).  They are okay.  Then we each had a Biryani and they were good.  The portions were also big.  I could only eat half, so we asked for containers to put our leftover into.  Since we also ordered a garlic naan and it never came, we asked for the naan to go.  When I got home, I couldn't believe the gave me a burnt naan!  Needless to say, I am throwing that out.  I am disappointed they forgot the naan first without apology and then wrapped up a burnt one for me to take home."}
{"text":"Can't put in to words how much my boo and me love this place!!!  The lady at front desk has always been nice and patients with all my questions of what is this and what is that... so if you are reading this.. thank you very much :)   Food is pretty cheap and authentic. Every time we walk into this restaurant there would be some other Indian families eating biryani... definitely a good sign imo :D. We tried goat, lamb, and mince lambs so far.... we love the lamb biryani the most!! And the portion is generous enough for 2 ppl to share.   Meat samosa is also spectacular!!!"}
{"text":"The food isn't necessarily bad, it's just not that good.  I was highly disappointed by the size of the lamb Korma it had 5 small pieces of lamb in a very thin curry sauce, while the flavor itself wasn't bad, it was not enough to share even though we got biryani also. The biryani was not my favorite either. There's better options in the area so unfortunately I don't think I'm planning on going back which is a shame as it's so close to home. For $30 for dinner for 2, you should expect to feel pretty satisfied which we just werent."}
{"text":"Wonderful food for the best price in the valley , very friendly atmosphere , we ordered fish Biryani which was great and large quantity which is good For 3 , pakoras are great as well ,must try"}
{"text":"We were looking for an Indian place to eat late night and stumbled upon this.  It was the weekend and we were surprised to see just a couple cars in the parking lot .  It was a small place , hardly 6 or 7 tables  So we assumed it to be a delivery place .  Got some Naans , Paneer butter masala , chicken biryani and for drinks we got badam milk and mango lassi . Mango lassi was the best , I was told  Badam milk was overwhelmed with Badam, that we had to suck the milk out of the glass  Biryani was a huge serving , it can feed atleast 3 adults  , I guess this is why this place got 4.5 rating  Because it is cheap, has an average taste and has massive servings .  Naans were chewy  But paneer butter masala was first class ,   Overall it's a delivery place  Ambience is less than appealing  Massive servings   If u r trying to feed a group and in budget this is ur place."}
{"text":"I came here since my usual Indian restaurant one block away is closed Mondays. I wanted to like this place but no matter how hard I could not, the food is flavourless with nearly no spice, the naan is overly thick, and for the price you do not get much food at all. I probably won't come here again, nice owners there is just better food 1500ft away at much better prices. This was one of very few times in my life that the food was truly inedible, I felt bad, but ended up tossing it in the trash and leaving before I had gotten even halfway finished."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious. However, if you place an order for delivery expect to wait more than two hours just to be told the restaurant lost your ticket so didn't make it and no longer have a delivery driver for the night. Hungry and tired and now waiting days for a refund. I'd recommend dining in the location. Never order delivery."}
{"text":"I just ordered Spl Chicken Dum Biriyani and Andhra Chicken Curry. Both taste very authentic. Can't wait to check out other dishes they offer."}
{"text":"Daawat is a small hole in the wall kind of casual Indian Restaurant. This is a no frills take out restaurant that also offers a small modest dining room for dining in. You order at the counter and all the food they serve will be in styrofoam ware. They serve Traditional North Moghali, South Hyderabadi and Indo-Chinese Style Foods.   We started with the Cut Mirch. They were tasty garbanzo bean battered hot pepper fritters. They served them with cooling tamarind and cilantro mint dipping sauces. They are tasty but are not for the faint of heart as they are fiery hot and pack a lot of heat.  We shared the House Specialty...The Chicken Dum Biryani and the Chicken Vindaloo.  The Chicken Dum Biryani was extremely fragrant and very floral....it possibly contained rosewater. I enjoyed all the exotic flavors and found it to be the most refreshing Biryani I ever tasted....but I didn't enjoy the dark meat chicken in it because it was over cooked and very dry.  I do warn you to be careful with this dish because it contained pieces of inedible cinnamon bark and whole cardamon pods.  The Chicken Vindaloo contained MOIST Flavorful Fresh Chicken......This dish was tasty but lack heat of any sort. I don't know but believe they accidentally prepared Chicken Masala.  Daawat Indian Cuisine offers different Indian Foods that you don't come across all the time.  Portions are very large and Prices are Low.  Some Hits and Some Misses warrants a three star rating"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from here last night. We ordered chicken curry, chicken tikka masala, chicken tikka kabob and garlic naan. The naan was a little burnt and the tikka masala had a slightly different flavor than what I'm used to. All in all it was good, just bit amazing."}
{"text":"I used to like this place. Suddenly their chicken biryanis started having only 2 bony pieces of chicken. Extremely stingy and disappointing. However their andhra chicken is pretty decent. I would recommend that. Overall, I dont think it's worth it given the price."}
{"text":"Was craving some Indian food after trying Saffron down the street a few days prior and unfortunately they were already closed but I needed to fulfill my craving and decided to give this place a try. Not so good. I called in my order and asked for extra spicy chicken tikka masala with rice and garlic naan. First impression walking in was \"yuck\" the place was dirty and super crammed. There were people eating there who seemed to know the owners because they had walked in and out of the back a few times. I wasn't greeted and felt very unwelcome and uncomfortable. Got my food and took off. Got home and the food was flavorless. There was zero spiciness to chicken and the garlic naan was burnt and not very garlicky. The rice tasted like plain sticky white rice with no flavor much like a Chinese version. I was very underwhelmed and not impressed. I guess when going from Saffron to then trying this that's what I get. I will only go to Saffron from now on and suggest the same."}
{"text":"Just placed an online order. New to Indian cuisine. Chose a few items and placed the order. I called shortly after and asked what would be recommended (maybe I should have called 1st) and if she could see what I ordered would be good for a new Indian palette. She was very hard to understand, which is no big deal, I figured we could still try to communicate. I asked what kids liked too and what suggestions she had beyond my order...she hung up on me. I'm not sure if that was offensive in a traditional Indian culture to feel that way by my questions to see if she could recommend something but I sure did feel like I needed to cancel my order stat. I called her back and she said that canceling was ok. Again a language barrier may have been involved; either way - I can't say this experience was positive."}
{"text":"Heard mixed reviews about food from friends ,but still went to try Haleem,wen asked the owner casually  if its freshly made,he replied so arrogantly and said it became  fashion for people to ask about freshness.though the Haleem was ok, pricing of 12$ for less than a  pound and seeing the owners arrogancy,I wouldn't recommend this place"}
{"text":"Excellent delicious finger licking food.  Birianie and chicken Masala is to die for( yummy) Giving them two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying I really really wanted to like this place a ton, but the food quality made it very hard for me to do so.   So first things first, Daawat is a little hole in the wall type restaurant with a handful of tables. It is very quaint and seems to be family run for the most part. Overall, you do feel like you are getting some sort of authentic Indian food experience from this vibe alone. However, the food hit a low 2.5/5.0 for me. The service was excellent which is what makes me round this up to a 3.0/5.0.   My family and I dropped by Daawat on a Friday around 1:00 pm. We put in our order quite quickly and the kitchen really pushed out the appetizers in a timely manner. We had the onion pakora and the chili paneer. Tastewise, both dishes were fine, nothing spectacular, nothing terrible. Be warned that the onion pakora portion is GIANT, definitely something to share!  For our entrees we had the paneer butter masala, aloo palak, daal, and thayir sadam/curd rice. We also grabbed some garlic naan and plain naan. Frankly, the curries were all extremely heavy. I know, I know paneer butter masala screams fat and heaviness, but even so, it had an excess amount of oil. The aloo palak was also very oily and even the daal was somewhat overwhelming. I had heard that the naan at this place was great so I was super looking forward to it, but it was honestly a let down. The garlic naans had both been overdone to the point of being crispy and the plain naan had areas that were overdone as well. The greatness of naan to me is that soft, flaky texture and we really missed out on that during this meal. We all picked at the food because of how oily and heavy it was and ultimately had a bunch of leftovers that none of us really looked forward to eating.   I want to give this place the benefit of the doubt and say that maybe this lack of quality was because of a busy lunch hour, but frankly I won't be dropping by this place any time soon."}
{"text":"Coming from LA, it has been difficult to really make me crave some of my favorite ethnic foods here in AZ. But I wanted Indian delivered and this was my one choice. And now it will be my first choice for Indian. Yum. Yum. Yum. The Tika is perfectly spiced. Tangy and spicy and unique. And the, I think, homemade naan was lumpy in places, flat in others giving it a very rustic feel. And it's another one of those flavors that has a taste like no other. Naan is just so perfect here. And they have both vegetable and meat samosas!  Try it. I have no idea what it's like inside but the food is just really, really good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.  The first time I came I ordered a chicken curry of some kind and was thoroughly impressed.  My second visit I ordered a lamb rice meal and found more bone than meat.  Overall the food here is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious food! Specially Goat dishes  1) Lamb Seekh kabab is out of world. 2) Goat masala curry is mouth watering to the core. 3) So as the goat biryani.. I personally wouldn't recommend eating any of the chicken dishes! They are little on bland side."}
{"text":"Really good, relatively cheap and great variety. Definitely an asset to the local restaurant scene and they deliver! Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious hidden gem with nice service. Love their plain and garlic naan, spinach pakoras, paneer butter masala and daal curry (packs a little heat!). Will continue to go back when in the area."}
{"text":"The worst food i ever had in my life...  I ordered idli and goat haleem...  first and last first the idli is worth for garbage...but the sambar only highlights it's not even worth for single cents....even 5 year kids can make best sambar ,but what i got is it's totally worst and worst...if anyone want to eat idli pls pls don't go this restaurant..and if anyone going to eat idli sambar first time pls don't go because you will hate idli in your life ....  the good thing is i didn't taste haleem   If i want to give a mark for idli out of hundred   IDLI =    -200 SAMBAR =    -500   I'm giving one star because of yelp not allowing zero star to post review.... pls don't go by my experience"}
{"text":"Decent food, and very much from north India but not Punjabi. Too pricey for the quality, and the restaurant leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"Good food, but can't say it was great. I had high expectations upon reading the reviews here. We did a take out order of Onion pakoras, Navratan Korma, Paneer Butter Masala, Naans and Lassi. The pakora was just ok, gravies were slightly runny and not up to the mark, naans were well done, lassi was very refreshing. We also reordered the naans on another occasion and it was very good. Service was quick and our order was ready for pickup before time. Price point is on the higher side and ambience is of a fast food joint than a restaurant. Overall, slightly disappointing (except for the very good naans!) and loads of scope for improvement on the gravies."}
{"text":"How on earth they got 4 stars? I would have given them zero star if possible. Was searching for a better biryani place and this came up first in the open now list. Reading all the good reviews about biryanis and meat samosas thought of ordering them. Placed order for goat biryani and meat samosas 30 mins before their closing time, and we were told that it will be ready in 5 mins. We reached there within 10 minutes and by the time we reached  they were almost closed. Man carrying large black tide up trash bag greeted us in. Lady at the front desk was helpful answering my questions and she asked us to recommend their restaurant to our friends \" if we like their food \". But I am sorry dear lady, I won't recommend even my enemy to have a goat biryani that has only big chunks of bones and not even single piece of goat meat in it. Both the sides they gave us were heavily diluted, you should have better given us the left over you had, we have plenty of good quality water in our home, at least we would have had the satisfaction of mixing good water in it . In a nutshell we had to have a large pile of oiled rice made with some leftover spices, along with our home made yogurt. Next is samosas, I don't want to mention the different colored waters the gave us in tiny containers as sides... seriously? Are you kidding me? A person who have never tasted a chutney in his/her entire life won't like what they gave us. The samosa shell was okay but filling was over spiced and not even close to actual samosas. It is clear that they filled our order with left overs. They should have told us that they were closing or out of food. We regret every single penny we spent there and for any reason we won't be going back to this place. Sorry dear lady your business isn't worth recommending to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of muttar paneer (spelled in a few different ways, but w/e). It's my favorite Indian food dish. Last night I got GREAT muttar paneer from here. Maybe a bit lacking on the spicy-ness but it was amazing. And well priced! My husband tried the chicken dum biryani and it was also really good. The naan was delicious, but I feel that's expected. I'll be returning for sure!  It's so good."}
{"text":"Order their food through Ubereats. Takes orders until midnight.  Chicken Vindaloo and Chicken Tikka Massala.  Both ordered at a medium spice.  Flavorful. Bold. Tasty.  **wish the menu was more descriptive"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Indian restaurant in the Phoenix area. The food is excellent, fresh and just the right amount of spice. I will drive from across the valley, just to eat at this establishment. I really do not understand the negative reviews about this place. Their food is amazing quality."}
{"text":"This was delicious.    I was a bit cautious ordering for delivery because of another persons review but they were very wrong.  Delivered within 45 mins and it was great.  We ordered about 5 things and all were great.  Highly recommend trying this place if you dig on Indian food.  You'll be pleased."}
{"text":"Four stars for me means I would go back.  Admittedly, my standards may be lower than the regular city dweller as I live in a location that has exactly two Indian restaurants-- and they're helluva overpriced.  We wanted to try Saffron but they were closed for some special event, so we went to the nearest Indian place which was this one.  Hole in the wall, open late, super.  They advertise themselves as specializing in biryani.  So... we got chicken tikka masala (the gold standard for me), paneer butter masala, chicken vindaloo, chicken biryani, samosas, and naan.  The samosas were alright- potatoey just the way I like them but they were a little salty.  Chicken vindaloo was delicious and definitely something we would order again.  Tikka masala good-- Im a little fussy about my chicken and I would have liked to know the meat was a mixture of dark and white-- I prefer white meat but the dark meat was edible (thats big coming from me).  The paneer was alright- I felt the curry was underseasoned and ended up mixing it with either of the other two curries we had.  Chicken biryani fine, nothing special but I honestly havent had too much of this specific entree to really know.  As for the naan, I've tasted far better but they were soft and tasted fine. Wish there were roti options.   Anyway, I'd recommend this for a quick Indian fix.  Maybe my opinion would change once I taste a few more Indian places in the area. For now, this is far better and cheaper than anything we have in Santa Fe."}
{"text":"We were very hungry , it was 9:45PM , we went in search of food. Lady in dawaat greeted us  and gave us a warm welcome .  We ordered fish biryani , idly n dosa. Idly dosa was exceptionally good!!! Fish biryani was finger licking awesome!!! I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Their take on vindaloo does not match with my, or most other restaurants, take on the dish. It's not traditional, or even modern vindaloo by most definitions. There's no sour, there's  no heat, it's basically bland and yeah that's the key dish I try every new restaurant on.   The onion pakora was excellent, good value but there's always a but. The two sauces green chutney, and tamarind? come in tiny cups that aren't big enough to dip but a corner in, and finicky so I ended up wearing it.   Maybe great place for appetizers the main event was a let down."}
{"text":"The. Chicken tikka masala, goat curry, and garlic naan are awesome! They have take out too!"}
{"text":"Great little place for Indian food. Not fancy at all.  If you walk in they have specials which change daily. I have gotten several items off their menu. Their biriyani which is a dish made of meat and rice cooked together for several hours is amazing.  Food is a touch oily but is very well seasoned. Some of the items are quite spicy so if you can't handle the heat make sure you let them know.   This is probably my favorite place for Indian cuisine in Arizona."}
{"text":"My buddy and I ordered from here through Uber Eats. Our food took almost an hour and a half to get to us, but it was Christmas Day so I won't really dock any points for that. My chicken tikka masala was creamy and reasonably tasty, but the consistency was a bit runny and there was this peculiar egg yolk flavor to the dish that I didn't really care for. The chicken itself was low quality. It was reasonably priced and I was full by the end, but I'll probably look elsewhere next time I'm craving Indian in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Chicken lunch special had good variety and was delicious. Nice person who worked there. Would go back any day. Love it."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. I am glad we went there. Their briyani and butter paneer masala was awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"I have only tried their dessert so far but I am very interested in their other food based off their desserts. Open late. Staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"When you find a restaurant that your heart and palate have both been looking for you want to keep coming back. This is my place!! Found Daawat on a search for Indian on my way home from work and so glad I did.  Shabana and Bobbo are so kind and helpful at recommending dishes for those who are new to Indian. They have North & South Indian dishes. They perfectly spice things to your liking. Tikka Masala, Biryani, Khoorma, Makhani, etc are all amazing."}
{"text":"Good, authentic Indian food. The tv was a little too loud and serving the food on paper plates with plastic forks is why I didn't give 5 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place. The best Indian food in Phoenix! Their dosas ans samosas are some of the best I've ever had. Their flavors are authentic and reminds me of home cooked Indian food!  It's just a ma and pa place, so ambiance is not their strong suit, but if you want yummy take out or delivery, or a nice lunch, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and the food is excellent, very tasty and the right amount of spice, perfect. Not the kind of place for dinner though, very basic seating and decor, but will be back for takeaway for sure"}
{"text":"Loved the meat samosas and garlic naan, but the chicken tikka masala was seriously lacking.   I came to Daawat after reading a great review about the meat samosas. Was not disappointed. They were stuffed with yummy well seasoned meat and vegetables. It came with mint chutney and a tamarind chutney, both had nice flavors.   Then came the chicken tikka masala. It was a nice orange color that screams \"I'm bursting with flavor!\" However, first bite betrays all. Very, very plain tasting. The chicken itself was okay, veggies were good, but overall really lacking flavor.   The garlic naan was very yummy and crispy. Would eat by itself.   I would go again to eat more samosas and maybe try the biryani or another menu item since this place has a lot of nice reviews. But certainly wouldn't get the chicken tikka masala again."}
{"text":"This Indian restaurant is absolutely fantastic compared to other places in the area such as shaffron. It also has very good prices and is very worth it for the money"}
{"text":"Had the Chicken(I can't pronounce the rest of it). It was great, and so was the service. We will be back to try other dishes. It was the first time that we've tried Indian food, and it won't be the last."}
{"text":"Ill make this review easy. I'm updating from my previous.  To sum it up, you know that feeling where you're eating delicious food and you're full, but you keep eating?  You're going to get fat here. :)"}
{"text":"Don't let the location deter you from trying this place, the service and food are absolutely fabulous. We had the onion pakoras, vegetable samosa, garlic naan, and chicken mahkani...all were delicious. The service was awesome too. I wholeheartedly recommend Daawat."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from here.   The food was SO oily and tasteless. I was so excited given the reviews.   The chicken tikka masala sauce was grainy and tasteless. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I called on the way home and asked for a pick up order. I wanted two plain chicken kabobs. He said 20 min. They were ready in 15 and exactly what I wanted. Just chicken, no onions or peppers. (I'm throwing them on top of a salad) they were so DELICIOUS. Cooked perfectly, and beautifully seasoned. I'm glad I grabbed a menu on the way out! Can't wait to dine in soon!!!"}
{"text":"Can't review the food at all - so my review is not based on food but on amenities. Wanted to try this place and drove up but there was a sign on the door that they had no restrooms. With small children in tow, that was a deal breaker for us and we decided to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh food every time! I highly recommend this place for any Indian food lover."}
{"text":"Left the whole uneaten plate on table. They do not give refund, I asked owner (woman) for refund. She said I ate some of the food. Don't go here and get taking advantage of. Chicken biryani is my favorite meal and I eat it at other places like pastries and chaat, tandoori times, and deli palace among other places. This was by far the worst I've had I was biting into green cardamom pods a lot and it had a very strong overpowering cardamom  flavor but besides that the rice did not have good flavor I wish I had ordered something else. It was like a mixed mess, orange rice with a bunch of haphazard things for flavor in wrong amounts. I couldn't eat their chicken biryani, tasted terrible."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food and super friendly family run business. We are here several times a month!"}
{"text":"Best Indian cuisine west of I-17 (maybe east too). Good variety of menu choices prepared fresh. Friendly family run business. You can tell they love what they do! Butter Paneer and  Chicken Koorma are favorites. However we have enjoyed trying new things each time we go. Definitely recommend for an out of the ordinary non-national chain experience! You can't beat the wonderful exotic smells and flavors!"}
{"text":"Happiness in the form of food... stumbled upon the jem while driving to Sedona via Phoenix ... the best goat biriyani I've had in last 5 years... it's family run and the food impressed me so much will come next time to Phoenix just for this culinary delight. Easy on the pocket too ... 10.99$ ."}
{"text":"Delicious! I got Chana masala and it was perfectly spicy - enough to make my nose run but not too much that I couldn't keep eating it. I love Indian food, but I always have a hard time finding a good place. Daawat hit the spot. Service was very friendly. It's a bit of a hole in the wall, but worth seeking out. Owner recommended garlic naan and she was right. We also had the vegetable samosa and the onion pakoras. The rice inside the samosa was perfect. We will go back. It's also a great place for take away curry!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. Dining area is small so this is truly a perfect carry out spot. I got the veggie samosas and they were really good. Chicken tiki masala was perfectly spiced. The garlic naan was different than what i am used to- it had the jarred minced garlic instead of fresh- still good but fresh would of been better. I will definitely order here again. I am not the indian food expert - i wish descriptions were on the menu or on the online menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch based off Yelp reviews and were glad we did.  This is real deal Indian home cooking.  We had the lamb curry, palak paneer, and garlic naan.  It all came with saffron rice.  Everything was wonderful, fresh and wonderfully spiced.  They also had some specials of the day and after seeing them go out, wished we had more room since they looked great as well.  It takes a bit of time, but totally worth the patience as it seems everything is scratch made to order.  You do get everything in Styrofoam dishes with plastic cutlery but I can forgive that because of the yummy flavors and generous portions.  I wish someone would open a place like this closer to the far North Scottsdale area - I'd eat there every week!"}
{"text":"The goat masala lunch combo is really worth trying. It's quite filling and is not very expensive."}
{"text":"Nice place for good biryani. We will definitely go back to try other dishes here   Azam family Friday. Ugh get ritual fry chicken and naans from daawat and kheer for dessert"}
{"text":"The worst food I have tasted recently. I ordered chicken lollipop but it tastes  like chicken dough I think any human won't eat this food. I don't? recommend this restaurant to anyone. It's better to avoid food from this restaurant even if they give the food for free. Overall the food sucks here!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall excellence. Not much room to sit, served on paper plates with plasticware, but the food is fabulous. Soft drink fountain hasn't worked in the 6 months we've been coming here. I don't drink soda, but this might be an issue for some (cans available, but of course no refills). This is the only reason I knocked a star off and service can be slow, but the food is five star! Favorites include Paneer Butter Masala, Chicken Korma, Lamb Vindaloo, and naan (onion or garlic). Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp curry and oh my God! Amazing spices! I could taste every different spice. Some I've never tasted before and it was like heaven. I love dishes where you can taste the individual ingredients. And this was a winner for me. I'm definitely putting this place on my to go list."}
{"text":"Food is great and have ate here several times for lunch.  I wish they would have more Combos similar to the lunch combo for dinner though. I personally do take out a lot and find my self not wanting to order after two because the lack of a combination meal.  Suggest offering 2-4 combos that include a smaller main entree or maybe 2 half entrees, naan, rice, Gulab Jamun, Samosa and maybe a drink for $12-$13. Basically your lunch combo but for a couple dollars more and offer it through services like Grubhub, your website and Uber Eats."}
