{"text":"Some of the best food, Mexican or otherwise, in the area!  Everything is prepared fresh, made from scratch and the presentation is spot on. Service was great and the atmosphere was pleasant. The music was the only piece of the dining experience that left something to be desired but other than that I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Our experience was the reverse of some the other reviewers: service was fine but food was not good. The chips and salsas were decent. I had the Al Pastor and Shrimp tacos. The problem was that I could not tell which was pork and which was shrimp - they both were chopped into the same size and tasted like overly seasoned and indistinguishable meat. Tasted my kids chicken fingers and they were dry and flavorless, straight from the freezer and microwave. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the worst service I have ever received in my life.  A group of us went after a kids softball game and they had 1 waitress on staff. So we went to the bar and let 3 girls sit at a table.  The only food we ordered was 3 kids meals that consist of a quesadilla and  two tacos. It took over an hour to receive the meals. We then had to rush the girls to eat and get back to the feild for more games. The waitress on staff also would not take our orders we had to order from the bar . This business will never get my service ever again. The only reason I am giving this one star is because I have to in order to do this review.  Other than that I wouldn't give them one."}
{"text":"I will not return to this restaurant. The service being the main reason. The servers seemed unorganized and out waitress hardly ever checked in on us. Food took an inordinate amount of time to receive and the order was wrong when it arrived. Taco Bell includes more meat in a taco than what I had. 
The salsas were good, and our chips were fresh- but this is an easy \"pass.\""}
{"text":"Awful experience. I went last night because I wanted to try it and they were showing Mayweather vs canelo fight. First of all there were people ahead of us that were completely turned off by the fact that nobody greeted them or even tried to talk to them, (I really heard their complaints when they were leaving) even though there were two employees talking to each other minding their own business instead of helping people out.
We finally got seated and we got one of the worst and rude waitress (her name is Carito) who never made us feel welcome or explain the menu or at least smiled the entire night. On top of that I think the owner's wife was more concerned in Collecting the cover to watch the fight than to provide a good customer service to us, so we told her to add the $10.00 cover to our bill.
The food was OK but it would be a sin if you screw up nachos but what really pissed me off is that Carito tried to charge me $50.00 for an open bar (which is the cover for the fight and we only had to pay $10.00 for it) so I explained her that there was a problem with my bill so she tried to correct it.
The second time she tried to charge me $25.00 extra and of course I complaint; she came the third time and told me it was corrected and she asked me if I was going to pay in cash or credit card and she was rushing me to pay and of course I checked the bill and there was a $20.00 cover charge.
After the fourth try she made it right and my guess is that her and the rest of the  staff members try to charge extra thinking that people are stupid to ask or too drunk to care about their bill.
The worst service I've received in a long time for food that it wasn't good. I even regret leaving her 15% tip."}
{"text":"Being of Latin decent this place is amazing. Great fresh food with wonderful service!!! I will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"When on Friday night the worts service we leave 5 min after our arrival never going back they are really rude"}
{"text":"\"Yay! I'm a fan.\" does Not do this place service.  Went their with my Sister and we had a Great Time!!!  We both chose the \"build your own\"... I got 1 chicken 'n 1 beef chimichanga and a beef taco(well, s'pose to be beef, but it was chicken... F Me Dude!  It Was Really Good), and a tostada on the side.  First off; The service was Excellent and they ended up refilling both the chips and my soda 3x's. in quick order... Someone from the staff was by the our table every 5/1- mins. or so and they were super friendly.  The food took about 20 mins. to arrive, However, The chips(Fresh/Hot) and salsa were so yummy we didn't notice.  The price is fair and they could charge more for the quality product they serve... Give it a try... it may be my new goto for Hispanic/Latin cuisine!!!(Also, they Do Not have just \"Mexican\" food; they serve items both Comlumbian and Puerto Rican as well..."}
{"text":"Some of the best salsa and pico!  The chips always come out hot and fresh.  The staff are very friendly and the food is authentic tasty.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Even though there are not many good Mexican restaurants in Matthews or Charlotte, they still need to have expectations. Even though the food was decent, the service was TERRIBLE. We couldn't understand a word the waiters where saying, mostly because they were hardly whispering to us. Their thick accents mixed with the whispering was very difficult to understand. On top of that, we had about a 15 minute wait for just drinks, and about a 40 minute wait to get our food. We had seven people with us, and three of them didn't fully enjoy the food, and one of them hardly ate any of it. The most enjoyable part of the restaurant was there nice bathrooms. 

Over all we were disappointed and probably will not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Do not eat at this location. First off i was suckered in due to a groupon deal i seen. After my dinner i showed my groupon and was informed they did not want to expect it. I was stuck with the bill and very dissapointed due to the quailty of the food was not worth the outrageous price. Chk quesadilla was watery and greesy . My friend ordered some dry steak tacos with no flaver if it wasbt for hot sause. The drinks were  11.00 for quevo margarita . Which they advertised as top shelf.  Not authenic mexican food at all. U are better off going elsewhere for your mexican crave . Unless u are into expensive water tasteless food."}
{"text":"Been here for about a half hour now. Have our margaritas, but they must be picking the avocados for the appetizer guacamole straight from a tree in California... We had two waitresses? Each of whom told us that the prices on the menu are not correct, but higher and they were getting new menus tomorrow... We actually ended up leaving! They didn't make us pay for our drinks, which was good, but wow! I wouldn't be surprised if they still hadn't put our order in by the time we left."}
{"text":"We had a Restaurant.com coupon we needed to use. We chose this restaurant because it was close to home, but I kept hesitating because most of the reviews have said good food, slow service. We found the food was great, and the service was excellent. We arrived for dinner at 5:30pm on a Thursday evening. Granted there was only 1 other car in the parking lot, I just chalked it up to we were there really early. The restaurant was very cute. The server, Walter, was excellent. He was very attentive and came to our table often. I had the Combo Special #1 (with Shredded Beef, came with beans and rice) and my husband had the Carne Asada. My plate was very nice for 1 person, not overly large and I finished it all. My husband thought the Carne Asada was good (came with flank steak, rice and beans), but I thought the flank steak was a bit thick. I still much prefer Zapata's in Ballantyne for Carne Asada. Prices were very reasonable. Oh, and I would definitely recommend to the owners that they change their name to something more along the lines of \"food\". It was way more of a restaurant then what I would consider to be a bar, as the name kind of indicates. I would hardily recommend Tacos and Tequila and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Bad service and an attitude by the manager will cause this restaurant to close in the next 6 months"}
{"text":"Used to like this place, but it's gone downhill in both service and quality. Waitress explained menu prices weren't accurate, but $2-$3 higher and that they didn't have their new menus in yet. Normally that wouldn't be a problem except for the already overpriced arroz con pollo went from $11.99 to $13.99, not to mention there was hardly any pollo in the dish. Wife's chicken fajitas were the same deal, overpriced without much meat. They bill themselves as upscale, nothing upscale about the joint."}
{"text":"I drove by this place last night. I believe they have closed their doors permanently. All exterior signs are off, parking lot empty and a large \"for lease\" banner hanging in the front of the lot."}
{"text":"If i could just write a review without a star i would. couldn't even finish our food. Very disappointed. Even the drinks weren't good."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a wonderful and pleasant surprise this evening when we had dinner at Tacos & Tequila Cantina Grill in Matthews, NC.  From the name, I was, well, expecting \"tacos and tequila\".  We could not have been more pleased with the excellent greeter, server or ambiance of this restaurant.  The menu is extensive and authentic Mexican (no Taco Bell stuff here).  We had to ask our server to interpret and explain some of the dishes on the menu.  She was excellent and highly trained.  They started us out (complimentary) with a large basket of fresh tortilla chips with three different dipping sauces (yummy).  Our dinners arrived in a timely manner and everything was fresh, fresh, fresh and very tasty.  Just right.  We'll definitely return to Tacos & Tequila Cantina Grill."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for T&T as I just moved to the area.  Food wasn't bad but the service was waaaaaaaaaay too slow.  

Typically, a place that is 20% full on a Sunday should be able to flip a small table in under 90 minutes.  I think T&T adds to the authenticity by having each order delivered from Mexico.  

I would have probably tried the guacamole or cheese dip but the waitress disappeared for 15 minutes after dropping off drinks, so there wasn't too much time.

Prices weren't bad but the food was only OK, and fairly typical of similar Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"The servers were friendly, but had difficulty answering a few questions I had about the menu even though he spoke English.  I ordered the fish tacos and the it was prepared differently than the waiter described (he said it was breaded and deep fried, but it was grilled). My husband ordered the steak tacos. The food was hot, but not very good. Then I dropped my napkin and picked it up right next to a DEAD COCKROACH. Yuuucccckkkkk. That's when we stopped eating.
The salsa was just okay, but they were happy to provide refills on the salsa."}
{"text":"Service was SLOW!!!! Our food took forever and the kid's meals were wrong. Our rice was obviously old and re heated because the rice was crunchy, not undercooked but from sitting all day in the kitchen. The chips have some weird film on them. Basically our food was gross. Just don't bother going"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know how this place stays in business. Why? I will explain. 
We decided to give this place another try after the first review I left on Yelp back in November 2013. I want to be completely fair and impartial  as I know this is a business that wants to succeed. 
My husband , son and I decided to return last night, a Tuesday, and we had the extra bonus of a coupon from the Clipper magazine. We were seated promptly , after all, Tuesday is hardly a busy night in most restaurants. The server , pretty young gal. greeted us, and took drink orders, which came back quickly. OK---the service was fast , not like the first night we were there and that is a plus. Now , the server took our orders and I  would estimate that our dinners were served in about 15 minutes. They looked pretty appetizing and I could not wait to dig in---hubby ordered the mixed Fajitas, our son had the Carnitas, his all time favorite, and I ordered a mixed platter of taco, enchilada and chimichanga. 

If you re-read my first review of this place I had issues with the rice and beans being stone cold so, without delving into the other dishes , I decided to try the rice first---as soon as I placed my fork into the rice I pulled up a five inch long hair that was dangling on the end of the fork!!!  I was so shocked and disgusted I could barely speak. My husband got up immediately to find our waitress and told her what was in the food---her immediate response was \"it's not my hair\" to which my husband repied, \"why does it  matter whose it is, it's hair\". 
 
She took the plate away and asked if I wanted anything else--like I could enjoy a meal after the experience I just had---my poor hubby and son were now bleakly looking at their food and wondering if the same would occur. Fortunately, it did not but how could one enjoy a meal with the thought of the hair maybe turning up in their food!

I think what angered and disturbed us most was that no  manager, male or female , ever came to our table to offer their apologies . I sat there in stunned silence as my husband and son ate , not enjoying this experience and who could blame them?  When done, we asked for the check, minus my meal and the coupon and left without a word or a thank you. 
 
It's  not my intention to ruin the dining experience of others but you will have to decide for yourselves if this is something you wish to endure while dining at this place. I realize these occurrences happen once in a while in the restaurant industry but it is inexcusable for the manager not to at least make an appearance at our table ---was it that embarrassing to you?  Very sad indeed and we will never come back!"}
{"text":"Great carne asada, service, and authentic cuisine.  The cheese dip was lacking flavor and spice.  Overall a good place and I would visit again."}
{"text":"I tried out this place after I saw a groupon and I really liked it. We had tequila fajitas and the seasoning was great! The prices are really good. Also the chips and salsa they serve disappeared within minutes, my friend said it was the best salsa she had. I'm pretty sure I'm coming back"}
{"text":"I went for a late lunch today with my boyfriend.  We had excellent service.  Our waitress was too kind.  

I love that you get your chips and salsa immediately. Today we ordered a small guacamole and it was delicious.  

For our entrees I ordered steak fajitas.  Amazing.  And my boyfriend got the deluxe burrito.  So much food.  

Service was great today.  Plus we had margaritas that were only less than $5! 

Delicious food.  Delicious drinks.  Great service today!"}
{"text":"Like some of the other reviews, the food is the better part of the overall experience here. 

We went here to use a coupon from restaurant.com. It was encouraging to see that there appeared to be a large crowd on a Saturday night, and we were acknowledged promptly by several staffers passing by. Similarly, when we were seated, no less than three different servers took out drink orders. This gives me the impression they aren't really organized from an operational perspective. The location is an old Shoney's with the telltale atrium windows, but is pleasant.

On to the food, my wife and I ordered the taco platters with 2 brisket, 1 chicken, and 1 shrimp each. While we waited, we went through a basket of chips and 2 little bowls of the house salsa and pico, both very savory and good. Our tacos took a little while to arrive but we were both very impressed at their \"authenticity.\" Unlike the typical low end Mexican style restaurants, our plates weren't loaded with fattening refried beans and tons of rice. We were very happy with the dishes. 

By the way, Despite the initial confusion, our server also ended up taking very good care of us. We even ordered the dessert, a very flavorful flan, which we devoured. 

Based on the food, we would definitely eat here again. But we realize the service could be iffy depending on the crowd and our luck in getting the right server. 4 for food and 3 for service and experience."}
{"text":"Horrible visit. Lousy service, mediocre food and a dirty place. It's no wonder there were only a few other people there for dinner."}
{"text":"Went in at 6 PM on Tuesday and the restaurant was mostly empty. We were a group of three.

The first thing the waitress tells us is the price on the menus are wrong by \"two or three dollars\" because they just updated their computers. OK, I guess I could deal with that.

We proceed to order 1 appetizer and 3 dinners. After 20 minutes, the appetizers and two dinners come. We pray before we eat, and when we informed the waitress we were told it would be 20 MORE minutes. 

When I asked to speak to the manager, I was told there was only one chef on duty, which she conceded was her problem. 

The food, particularly the cheese quessidiia was terrible. The rest was edible but sub par.

This was probably the first time in 25 years I left zero tip. My normal range is between 22 and 30 percent, based on food, service and friendliness. 

I'll never return."}
{"text":"A very enjoyable meal. I had the beef fajitas.   My husband had the Tequila Burrito. The serving size of fajitas was huge. The beef was flavorful and sides were plentiful. I loved their extra spicy salsa. You have to ask for the spicy salsa. We will be back. Tequila was good too."}
{"text":"I would pass on this establishment. The food was just OK, meat was undercooked for sure. What really stands out is the lack of management's service, I tried this place with my wife for lunch with a Living Social voucher. When i went to pay with it they said it was for dinner only. No where on the voucher is the word dinner. NO WHERE. We had a great server, Ashley, but management el suckos. There is much better Mexican food in Matthews than this joint as well.  UPDATE after management response ....nowhere on the voucher is the word DINNER mentioned. NO  WHERE! I don't want free food, I make more money than you and have no problem paying for meals. All I wanted was for you to honor the voucher. The voucher isn't for free food either jackass, it's $30 for $15. If I never paid for it how would I have it in my possession? If I never paid for it why would Living Social refund my money for it after you refused it FOR NO REASON? You don't have to be Mexican to be an idiot. Check your new Living Social voucher that went live today too, guess what? THE WORD DINNER IS NO WHERE ON THERE EITHER!   Your business won't last long because of your lack of service and attitude. I can give you a list of restaurants that do offer service not attitude if you would like some lessons."}
{"text":"Second time here since we moved from St.Louis, MO 8 months ago. It was OK both times. Upon entering the restaurant today for lunch, the Health Department score was 93.I wanted to turn around and walk out, to me, that speaks volumes about a place that I actually want to eat at. However, my hubby and son wanted to give it a try. The tortilla chips were horrible to me. They gave an oily after taste where I could not even taste the tortilla chip at all. The salsa was good and the 2 shredded beef chimichangas were OK. The environment could have been cleaned much better than it appeared, hazy mirrors, floor needed to be swept. It was very hard to understand our waiter,although I think he was pleasant!

At this point after seeing the 93 score, I think I'd like to try another place that has higher scores. I admit I am a clean freak when it comes to someone preparing my food. As a former Missourian, we did not have number scores to restaurants, only letter scores. Grade A, you would think that was great...until you really see how they come up with that grade after all the mishaps are subtracted from 100. There is a 10 point difference between Grade A & Grade B. I will be looking up this place's score to see how they did on their 93 score inspection.

I love what North Carolina does by posting their scores as you enter the establishment. My new home state, suits me well with their Health Department scores and how they publish it and all the things that were found wrong on inspection day."}
{"text":"Horrible experience from beginning to end. Took forever to get our order in, food took forever to come out, and food was not very good. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Service and Food were very good.  We had Pork Carnitas and Three Amigos platter (chicken, shrimp, beef) for dinner along with small size guacamole appetizer.  We were seated immediately, attentive service by waiter and another person, saw all servers doing their jobs (meaning no one was on their phones texting, etc.), food arrived in timely fashion.  Quacamole was AWESOME.  Chips were warm and fresh and so good.  Would be nice to have the option of mild or hot salsa--mild was served with the chips.  It was good, but we do like our salsa a little hot.  We will definitely go back.  The  choices on the menu are a little more creative than other Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Service is the worst ever our server acted like she hated her job and everyone in the restaurant. Which there were exactly 10 of us. The soda was flat the chips were fried in  old oil, and the guacamole was a joke. It was supposed to be made table side miss attitude came out with her tray all ready mashed up avocados and a bunch of cups she asked us if we wanted everything and I said yes she dumped it all in and handed it to us un-mixed. I proceeded to mix it up and all we could taste was lime it was so sorry we couldn't stand it. I immediately told the waitress that the guacamole was too sour and she took it back gave a huge attitude. We waited for another 10 minutes and finally they brought out our food but still no replacement guacamole. After she served us the food she said I will be right back with your guacamole, she didn't brought out another tray with the same ingredients as before dump them all in the bowl except for this time we didn't get any time at all. Needless to say it also was poorly mixed! I got a taco salad with a side of Spanish rice and my friend got the two tacos dinner special, these were just ok entrees not the best Mexican food I've ever had. I will not be returning to this restaurant and I will not be recommending it to any of my friends and family and fact I would recommend they go Somewhere else altogether."}
{"text":"We just moved to Charlotte and have been looking for a relatively inexpensive spot for Mexican food. I think we have found it.  The only downside is we went in for lunch and it took about 45 minutes. In my opinion that's a little too long."}
{"text":"Had the lunch portion of chicken fajitas which were horrible.  The chicken, peppers and onions looked like Chinese stir-fry.  The tortillas tasted like they'd been on the grocery store shelf for a couple of weeks.   The guacamole was almost brown and the rice looked like Lipton rice.  I didn't get any cheese which is usually a part of a fajita meal.  The chips and salsa were the highlights of my meal.  Needless to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"The star is for the unsweetened ice tea, which was good.  Although it did take a while for it to get to the table.

The chips were thick and tasted stale.  The pico de gallo, in the words of my spouse, was unseasoned and gross.  The house salsa tasted like tomato juice; even my ten-year-old hated it.

I'd like to tell you how the food tasted, but I can't, because after waiting for our meals in a nearly empty restaurant for almost 45 minutes, we left."}
{"text":"Warning Yelpers: This place no longer honors Restaurant.com coupons. There are signs all over the front doors stating this, which is ...weird. I didn't have a coupon but several reviewers here mentioned them. 

I ate here and died of boredom. 
We ordered the smaller plate of Aguachiles ($17!) and Enchiladas in Mole sauce ($7 for lunch)

The wait was very long because I ordered from the dinner menu at lunch time, but that's not a problem. There were 3 complimentary bowls of salsa:  standard, tomatillo and pico de gallo. I liked the pico de gallo, they all tasted ok but they were so bland that we finished all 3 bowls without even noticing it. 

I ordered the Aguachiles because the dish looked exactly like ceviche of filet shrimp that Fiesta Jalisco used to serve at this same location.  But Jalisco's was hot and  delish while this was nothing of the sort. It didn't even have avocado and red peppers like the picture on their menu. All we could taste was first sharp red onions, then lime juice and finally ground jalapenos, bitter and sharp, $17 for a small portion?
1 star

Next the enchilada, the mole sauce was not bad, not great but the chicken was dry (because Gringos insist on white meat only) and when I was offered a bit more all I could reply was \"no thanks, I'm bored with this\"
 
 I'm giving them 2 stars instead of only 1 because the waitress cared and tried her best, but next time I'll drive down to La Unica instead"}
{"text":"How do I put zero stars????TERRIBLE! Should never go there! The owner - Ryan, was the RUDEST most arrogant person ever. Went there with a groupon stated dinner for 4, but the owner refused to take the groupon while we had a dinner of 6. He refused to take the groupon and made us pay for the full bill. We had to get up three times to get service. This was the second time we went there; however, even the first time was slow."}
{"text":"I came to this place bc my friend gave me a groupon, so my expectation is not high at all. However, the whole dinning experience is just HORRIBLE!!!! 

Waiting 15 min to be seated, which it's understandable for a Saturday night. 

The waitress didn't came to the table til I waved her down to ask for a server, bc i sat down for 15 min without a drink, but the table next to me got their drink a long time before us, and they came after me!

Ordered Fuente Marinia, a seafood plate with crab leg, mussel, clam, scollop, octopus, and shrimp. I asked for no mussel and no octopus, just extra shrimp! 
I also ordered a sopa de pollo.

When the plate came, there's no CRAB LEG on it. And there's only 2 big shrimp! So no worth for $23! I just told the server to send it back and get me tres amigos(chicken, steak, and shrimp). Such a disappointment. 

Then I found a yellow rubber in my chicken soup!!!!! So I just tell her to switch to shrimp tacos without onions for me. She kept apologizing, but I can see she was annoy by I kept founding something wrong with the order.

And when the tacos came, guess what!!! There's onions on them. You would thought she would paid extra attention to the order since the \"kitchen\" messed up soapy times already. But no!!!!

At the end I just tell her to box up the tacos, even tho there's onion on them. I would have return everything and left if I didn't have the groupon. I definitely will NOT go back.

Oh and she tried to charge me the $23 for the $16 plate I switched to. Ugh never again


Oh I guess the only ok thing is the mango margarita"}
{"text":"It isn't every day that I take the time to write a review just mere hours after visiting an establishment, but given that this restaurant is still new and doesn't have a review posted yet, I decided to step up to the plate and put pen to paper (actually fingers to keyboard, but you know what I mean haha) in order to help give back to all the yelpers out there who have been so helpful to me since I first joined the site.

First, I want to let you know that restaurant.com had one of their awesome 80% off specials running a week ago and I saw this place listed with one of those great value $10 off $15 purchase coupons.   I love those coupons, because being the math nerd that I am, I am usually able to meet a friend for lunch and end up with a bill right at $15, resulting in a total bill of about $5 each (including tax and tip) with food left to spare.

So, with coupon in hand, I headed over for lunch (very easy to find, just past the post office on John St), grabbed a parking space right up front (parking lot kinda tight with the multiple rows of diagonal spaces in front, but plenty of additional spaces in back).  Have to admit that it was kind of weird to be one of maybe only 2-3 cars in the parking lot at 11:30am on a Friday, but shrugged it off to the place still being new, so I headed inside with no expectations and an open mind.

From the moment I entered, I felt very welcome, as each and every member of the staff that I encountered met me with a smile and made me feel like they were genuinely happy that I was there.  The hostess seemed to actually enjoy her job and all of the servers looked like they were excited to be there, which was a very welcome change from some restaurants where it seemed like the employees would rather be anywhere but at work.  Not the case here, as everyone was in such a great mood and it was contagious, so definite compliments to those who trained the staff as it was awesome to be in such a welcoming and friendly environment from start to finish.

Now on to the food...

The chips were fresh and not heavily salted like some places, which was a huge plus.  The red salsa had a nice flavor with just the right level of spiciness, and was not watered down or bland like the kind that is sometimes found in other places.  

They have a special lunch menu where you can \"build your own super lunch\" for $5.99, and this includes 2 items from the following list (Taco, Enchilada, Burrito, Chimichanga, or Tostada), with your choice of filling (Chicken, Ground Beef, Shredded Beef, Beans, or Cheese) and you get rice, beans and salad with selection.  My friend ended up doing this and adding a Beef Tamale for $1, and it was definitely a great value for the price as he had enough food left over for dinner later.  I ended up getting the Deluxe Burrito for $8.99 (goal was to get as close to $15 as possible LOL) and again, it was a great value as it was very filling and wasn't smothered in a bunch of unnecessary everything.  Very good flavor with shredded chicken that was very tender .

Service with a smile continued throughout the meal and I never once had to do the \"where is my server neck workout\" when my water cup was down to about half full.   We were asked multiple times how everything was, and the service was very attentive to every need without being intrusive.  

My water cup was filled consistently, salsa was refilled promptly and we were asked if we would like more chips once you could start to see the bottom of the basket.  All definitely huge pluses. especially with the coupon clearly visible on the table, as you know some places get weird on service when a coupon comes into play, but here they loved the fact that we were giving them a shot and they welcomed the restaurant.com coupon with a smile (what else haha) and returned promptly with our bill ($8.33 total after coupon).

We hung out for a while after we had paid the bill, and never once did we feel rushed, and they had no issue refilling our waters even after we had already paid.  Again, nice touch that speaks to the high level of service here.  

The coolest part was, as we were getting ready to leave, they gave us both coupons for us to use on a return visit.  Coupon #1 - 30% off dinner \"if you like us on facebook\", Coupon #2 - $5 off $25 purchase and Coupon #3 - Buy one app get one 50% off.  The card containing coupons 2 and 3 actually had a sample menu an social media info on the back which to me was a cool touch and a nice way to drive repeat business and additional word of mouth.  

Overall, I highly recommend that you head out to Matthews and give this new hidden gem a shot, as there is nothing better than finding that proverbial needle in the haystack, so check 'em out as it is great to find a place with such a high standard when it comes to customer service excellence.  I will definitely be back, even if I don't have a restaurant.com coupon!"}
{"text":"Will ABSOLUTELY NEVER come back here again. Some of the staff seem to be decent people but the management seems to not care about their restaurant whatsoever. The Charlotte Women's Soccer Association was really excited about this restaurant becoming a regular spot for the ladies after our games at the Matthews Sportsplex, but unfortunately they have refused to pay their sponsorship. Very disappointing as they look like they could use the business brought by the 200+ women and their families in the league."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I have ever had in a restaurant -- 
THE worst in a Mexican restaurant.  No one was there--that should have been a hint. Service was SO slow, my expensive drink was watered down, and my food was cold."}
{"text":"BUYER BEWARE. they sold groupons this week and charged 2 more for every item we ordered. RIP OFF. They were overly nice until I made them charge me the menu price"}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend and we weren't in a hurry, so we really enjoyed this restaurant. The chips were fine, the pico was fresh and delicious, salsa was watery. Service was slow but very friendly. I had a chili relleno, delicious, my friend had arroz con pollo, which she really liked. I finished with flan which was great, but over decorated. It was better than many other Mexican places I've been in Matthews. I will definitely return, knowing it is not a quick place."}
{"text":"This was our first time here...we had a groupon so we were excited to try!  This place was awesome, the fajitas were so yummy, the guacamole was outstanding!! Had the top shelf margarita very yummy and fresh flavors!!!  The salsa wasn't the best but everything else made up for it!!! Service was good!"}
{"text":"Waited almost 2 hours for food. One server for about 11 tables. Poor thing was running like crazy. First batch of chips we got were cooked in so much leftover oil they tasted like old oil. Second round was better. By the time we got our food we just had a packed up so we could leave. No drink refills. However very nice folks. I may give it one more chance just because of how nice the owners were."}
{"text":"The service was horrible and the food was even worse.  Beans were like wallpaper paste.  The chicken tasted like a piece of charcoal right out of the fire.   Ceviche not sure what that was didn't look like shrimp to me.  I'm usually not a picky person but I won't be back to this place. I ll leave on a positive note...the chips were good."}
{"text":"The owner was a very difficult man who was trying to not honor our Groupon. We had alcohol on our bill and the Groupon did not exclude alcohol. He told me it was against the NC ABC Laws to discount alcohol. While this could be the case, I was unaware of it and specifically bought the Groupon so my sister and I could have a margarita with our lunch. He said that, as customers, we should Google \"NC ABC laws\" before going out for dinner (he literally said that). When I said I was not trying to be difficult and that in my restaurant experience (for several years), I always understood the customer to always be right. He shouted \"the customer is not always right\". He then proceeded to trash talk me in Spanish to the manager (female, she was very pleasant). Little did he know that I speak Spanish! I called him out in Spanish, the argument ensued. Finally, he left and I spoke one on one with the manager and explained the situation. I also showed her other Groupons that state \"Not Valid on Alcohol\". She said that I was absolutely right and finally honored the Groupon. The whole ordeal was heated and probably delayed us 15-20 minutes. The food was okay, it took about 35 minutes for one combo platter to come out which is unacceptable, especially at a Mexican restaurant! I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I recently left a review stating the facts of my visit at this restaurant and received a response from the business owner. Needless to say I'm totally shocked at the message I received and would like to share it with any potential dissatisfied customers in the future.
I'll also be attaching a screenshot for authenticitys  sake. I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else!

And for the record, not that it's anyone's business at all, we received a groupon to this restaurant as a birthday gift from a family member and decided to try it out on their recommendation.

{"text":"Everything was just ok... Drinks took forever! Food was just ok... Atmosphere decent but nothing special."}
{"text":"The food here as okay, nothing incredible, but average Mexican food here in the suburbs of Charlotte.  Our main issue was the waitstaff which basically was non-existent the late afternoon we dined in.  We waited about 45 minutes for our dinners, and before that about 15 for drinks/chips/salsa.  We only ordered waters so it wasn't a difficult drink order or anything.  We almost got up and left but we noticed the people next to us were getting attention so we figured our service would change, but it did not.  It was not a busy rush time or anything either so it was incredibly frustrating.  When we mentioned how long we'd been waiting and were curious to why the waitress looked confused and walked off.  We waited about 15 minutes to get our check and left.  Other than the horrible service we experienced, the food was fine, we may or may not go back here."}
{"text":"This is our FAVORITE Mexican restaurant.  We moved here from Southern California 16 years ago and searched  all over the Charlotte area until we discovered this place.  Have been there ever since they opened. Their food is FRESH and DELICIOUS.  Their GREAT service comes and goes (haha).  Lately, it's been great again.  We celebrate every big family event there.  My only complaint -- they recently ditched their AMAZING salsa for tomato sauce :-/   Other than that, Tacos and Tequila remains our FAVORITE.  My husband and I are going there for a date tonight!  I can almost guarantee you will not be disappointed. :-)"}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic Mexican food with many delicious seafood options. We lived in Texas for five years and got really spoiled by the delicious Mexican food options there. Charlotte does not have many good options, in my opinion. But Tacos and Tequila in downtown Matthews gives me hope! As many small, family-owned restaurants learn, it can be difficult to hire and keep good staff. That seems to be one of their issues, which may explain the low ratings from some Yelpers. But of the 10-12 times we have dined there, maybe once did we feel the service was lacking. The rest of the time, we were greeted and seated quickly and the service and food were great. 

Let's talk about the food: If you like seafood, check out their seafood menu first. Bypass the enchiladas and all the typical stuff and try their sopa de marisco, which is a delightful seafood stew filled with fresh shellfish and seafood. It's enough to share, really! They also have great fajitas. My husband goes crazy for their pollo con arroz which is simple and filling and a perfect Mexican \"comfort food\". I also highly recommend their guacamole, which is prepared table side. Oh and did I mention the reasonable prices? 

Drinks: okay so don't be boring and get the house margarita. Try their margarona, a margarita with a small corona beer inverted into the glass. Yum! My new favorite way to enjoy a margarita- love that it cuts the sweetness and the beer adds a little fizziness to the whole concoction. Also- if you like a sweeter cocktail, they have a special margarita that is hand mixed and served in a half gourd, complete with plenty of fruit garnish. So fun and yummy.

Lastly- be sure to duel it out on the beer pong/ping pong table while you wait for your entree. 

Give T & T a chance, Matthews. It may just surprise you and become a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Taco & Tequila Cantina Grill is new to Matthews. I think this location used to be an Italian restaurant, then a different Mexican restaurant, and is now home to Taco & Tequila Cantina Grill. It is right next to the Matthews Post Office, and across the street from Finz. The parking lot is small, but there is additional parking around the back of the building. Inside, they have a bar that you can sit at to enjoy some food, drinks, and tv, along with large seating areas. The service was efficient and friendly. The menu is not too big, unlike a lot of Americanized Mexican restaurants. When I go to a new place I like to know what the staff's favorite menu item is, usually their pick entices me to stray from my \"norms\" and pick something different. I asked the waitress what her pick of the menu was and she had no answer for me, she did not know. We started off with the bean and cheese dip, then, since the waitress did not have a favorite, I went with what I knew, the two enchilada and one taco combination. This came with refried beans and rice. The bean and cheese dip had great flavor, and was very addicting; the basket of chips disappeared before my eyes! The meal came out quickly, hot, flavorful, and generously portioned. My boytoy said the enchiladas were some of the best he's had around town. The beef had a lot of flavor and wasn't dry, and the enchilada sauce had all the right flavors. The service was friendly, food good, and prices fair. If you are in the area, stop in and check it out! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! In my previous review I had a lot to complain about, but after the owner messaging me and asking me to come back, I'm glad I did. They got a MUCH better staff (all of them speak English) they were like bam bam bam when it came to filling up drinks and bringing the chips and salsa and the food even tasted better! We got the same thing as last time, and the steak fajita had a lot more meat and less onions. I'll defiantly be back and I'll bring some friends :)"}
{"text":"Nice mexican restaurant, real flavor, friendly staff...Try aguachiles... they are awesome...."}
{"text":"This place was great about an year ago. Since then it has gone down hill. I ordered 4 tacos (on $2 taco Tuesday) and a drink while I waited. They brought me 4 ORDERS of tacos totaling $50! Then instead of admitting the mistake and removing from my bill, they \"auctioned\" them in the bar. Having other patrons pay me cash to make up the difference! Bad business, not friendly at all."}
{"text":"I love this place. The BEST MARGARITAS! It does take a while to make them.... But it's because they're made from scratch. They make their own simple syrup, squeeze the limes themselves and all. Amazing. I like mine frozen. Not to mention they're huge. You can go for the top shelf ones if you want but the house one are just as good. The fajitas are awesome, the salsas are great as well. I've tried tons of things from their menu and never been dissatisfied. Love this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been twice.  The first time, the appetizer and entree he ordered they were out of so he had to start over.  My plate was just okay.  The second time, I ordered the House Taco plate (4 tacos of various meats with a side of beans) for $10.  My husband ordered 3 chicken tacos a la cart, no sides and he was charged $3 each ($9).  The menu price was $1.95.  They argued that the tacos a la cart were beef only (although there was no indication on the menu of WHAT they were.)

The food is served on huge plates, but its really just spread out.  The tacos are only 4\" in diameter, but they served them open-faced, so they looked huge.  Not.

We used Groupons both times and lost money.  I'm not going back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was great! I got the enchilada tequila and my sister got the burrito tequila and then our friend got the arroz con pollo. All of these dishes were delicious! I didn't think that the dishes would be the size that they were, they were gigantic. And now with the cheese enchilada... I've never had a cheese enchilada taste like that before it was amazing. I recommend everyone to come and try this restaurant! It is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan. There are similar Mexican joints near me that are better.

The food was fine. Nothing great. The service was slow the night I was there. If I lived near it, I might go back. But I would not make a special trip for it. Again, there are a number of similar Mexican places around town. This does not rise above average in my book."}
{"text":"Tacos and Tequila has good food for sure, but the service was terrible.

The margarita was decent (definitely go for the top shelf). Guacamole is prepared fresh at the table with several mix in options including jalapeño. I had the fajitas which were sizzling and flavorful.

Unfortunately the service overshadowed the good food. Slow on drinks chip refills.  Almost considered eating guac with a fork in a particularly long chip absence. Waited 5 mins for tortillas after the fajitas came out. 

Worst of all, the tv couldn't be changed because the \"managers office was locked.\" Sooooo....I missed the Alabama vs auburn game (possibly the best college football game in history). So yeah I'm a little bitter. 

Overall, food was not incredible enough for me to chance another similar experience."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Mexican food then stay away from this restaurant. I've had the worst meal I've ever had here, by far. The oysters we ordered were old...not fresh at all. The molcajete we ordered was supposed to include clams, shrimp, and scallops. They were not in there and when we questioned the waiter we were told that they did not have scallops or clams on hand. We were told they 'threw' in some extra mussels. The fajitas that we also had ordered were dry and unappetizing. Even the simple rice and beans were awful. The service was extremely slow on top of the awful food. My take - Stay away.

We found this place using a Groupon - Usually when using a Groupon there is no problem. With this place - WRONG. The Groupon purchased was $24 for a $40 meal. Upon presenting the Groupon we were informed not very politely that there had to be 4 people. There were 3 of us. That was the first caveat that this place was not going to be a good dining experience. The old oysters that we were served got sent back. When presented with the bill they did not deduct for the oysters that were sent back nor for the seafood missing from the molcajetes. They charged full price for their bad food. They proceeded to deduct the $40.00 Groupon but somehow the bill came out to the full $40.00.... $24.00 for the Groupon price plus the extra $16.00 that they made the bill out for.

So again....please don't patronize this restaurant as the food is awful, the service is awful, and on top of that - they do not honor the Groupon correctly. If there was a way to give them negative stars I would."}
