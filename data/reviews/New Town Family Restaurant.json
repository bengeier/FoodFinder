{"text":"Food is your typical diner fare. The servers were very friendly and cordial. Unfortunately it suffers my biggest restaurant pet peeve: CASH ONLY. So they lost a star there.

The second lost star was for the two flickering light bulbs I was seated under as well as never being asked if I wanted my coffee refilled as the cup sat empty almost my entire visit."}

We had a big turnout today, and had to keep adding chairs and tables to accommodate our group of 9. The number seemed to \"scare\" our waitress a bit, but she handled it with good humour and efficiency. 

I believe we all had some version of the all day breakfast except one, who lived dangerously by ordering the omelet. My three eggs over easy were done right, and the home fries, a pretty soft version of this ubiquitous diner dish, was tasty and home made. We know that, as we witnessed the delivery of huge bags of PEI potatoes. The coffee was about average for greasy spoons, the toast was of the \"Wonder\" variety, and I'm told the bacon and sausage were tasty.

Based on the exterior, the interior actually surprised me, being brighter and cleaner than I anticipated. Although about the same distance from home as other greasy spoons in my neighbourhood (Sunset Grills - Danforth AND Queen), the Bus Terminal Diner or the Beachside Grill), I don't think it will be replacing any of these as a choice for breakfast. Well, maybe the Sunset Grill - Danforth."}
{"text":"This place is great. It feels like a diner out of a Quentin Tarantino movie. Awesome breakfasts! They definitely know the beat way to make your eggs. And servers are great too!"}
{"text":"The food here is fabulous! The atmosphere doesn't look appealing at first, but the service, food quality and friendliness of everyone more than makes up for it! Prices are great, too! After a few visits the waitress knew me and my usual order. The patrons will give you some great people watching opportunities! The owner is amazing and friendly, too! Love this place!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a greasy spoon breakfast that's not too greasy, then this is the place. We've been going here for many years for breakfast if we're in the area, even back when it was called the Sunrise. The price is right and the food is always good, and the staff always friendly. And if you don't really feel like hash browns ask for a scoop of mashed potatoes. Sit in a window seat and do some people watching. When you finish hop across Coxwell and check out the two great dollar stores. (Dollarama & Dollar Tree). Or check out Little India along Gerrard."}
{"text":"this place has a decent all day breakfast, 3 eggs, hashbrown, toast and you choice of meat at a fairly cheap price. 
Never order anything else, it's frozen and terrible. I got curious or adventureous once or twice and then punched in the mouth with an overcooked deepfried veal on a bun and burger that taste of sad broken horse.
The decor is somewhat lacking, or it isn't, strange vinyl pictures of fruit tacked to the tables, creepy wall paper, a ceiling that is still nicotine stained and people that actually come and order a liver dinner. 

The staff consist of working at a diner for life folk, cooks who appear to be greek and don't really talk to you seemly very gruff. A waitress that is a real life kids in the hall bird lady and some other mild mannered people. 

It's terribly busy with families on weekends and city workers weekday mornings.

All in all, if you want a greasy spoon breakfast, its there, though I wouldn't be traveling across town to eat there."}
{"text":"Cash only and not a spot for people particular about decor BUT the people who work here care, and the food is delicious. These gems are what make Toronto so special."}
{"text":"Great token $5 breakfast place. We tried western omelette and peameal bacon and eggs. Coffee was surprisingly good too!"}
