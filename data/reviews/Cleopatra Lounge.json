{"text":"Great price. simple place to hang out, play games , I've studied here before. Open late too"}
{"text":"Went there with a friend for some hookah after finding the place on yelp, got to say that I'm happy that Markham has a spot that is similar to the spots on Lawrence.  They got over 20 different flavors and the place is pretty big. This is going to be my go to place for shisha as its in Markham and has awesome flavors that other places don't have. Only thing is I wish they had alcoholic drinks, but other than that this place is awesome."}
{"text":"First time here. Pretty nice lounge to chill with friends and smoke shisha. Flavorful shisha  but they use cheap disposable hoses (not cool!). Relaxing ambience with dimmed lights (can be a little depressing for some). Super friendly service. Great music. Free WiFi. Downside is that there isn't much to eat here, and washrooms are mediocre. $1 charge for credit card use."}
{"text":"This place was pretty chill. I went there with a friend. Shisha was not bad at all. A good alternate if you are up in Markham area and want to avoid driving to Lawrence East or Mississauga."}
{"text":"Felt like i should make a review since im here at least twice a week.
Everyone that works here is super friendly, however they are always in and out, but its not a big deal. The shisha here is blessed and the staff can alwaye help you out if you have trouble deciding what flavours you want !!! 
The environment is super relaxing and chill, its not the fanciest place, but i love the vibe. 
Fair priced shisha, chill staff and free wifi sounds pretty blessed to me."}
{"text":"Way below average place compared to other good options around.
The place is fairly small and could fill up easily, which is good for the business; however, the ventilation is close to NONE. You leave the place smelling like shisha and it isn't pleasant!

Prices are very cheap, which as a result, it attracts younger crowd, but the place is very torn out, with booths ripped and burn marks all over the place.

The decoration/theme of the place is lost! It's called Cleopatra with one picture of the pharoah goddess on a wall, but nothing else hinting to the egyptian/pharoas theme! You have a painting of david Beckham, Maradona, Tupac! If you pick a theme, stick to it so the place be cool!

Unfortunately, it's close in the area but I won't be returning to this place, an experience that I'm not willing to repeat!"}
