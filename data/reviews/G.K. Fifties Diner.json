{"text":"It's barely acceptable as a greasy spoon. It looks about an unappealing from the outside as the food does on the inside. It is very cheap and it's not like the food will make you sick so if you're stuck for breakfast and you have $5-8 to blow this could be your ticket."}
{"text":"Good breakfast food & smoked meat, nice 50s decor, poor service.

Our waitress was crabby.  She was inattentive, didn't offer a high chair for the baby, got my order wrong, and wouldn't substitute fruit for fries... even though the side order price was essentially the same."}
{"text":"Finally, Fifties Diner is open!!

The food is just as good as before, maybe even better!

I love the bigger location and the decor is still the same as before. Lots of decorations on the walls."}
{"text":"The best fries I've had in ages! Go for the large smoked meat sandwich, which easily competes with one you'd get at Ben's in Montreal back in the day. 
Very friendly atmosphere, clean and fast."}
{"text":"Wait: We came during lunch time, chose lunch over brunch, and waited literally 30 minutes for our appetizer. 

Food: Pretty stunned to get a plate of plain cut-in-half toast, with only one of them dabbed with a lick of garlic butter. Please remember to put garlic spread on your \"garlic bread\" before you serve it!! WTF?  Didn't send it back because it was only an appetizer. The lasagna was also pretty disappointing - the edges were dry, noodles weren't layered- more like piled; meat sauce had sausage and pepperoni in it...

Service: Waitress was sweet and moderately attentive. 

Note: The breakfast looked good, probably should've opted for brunch. But again, if you serve lunch, make it decent."}
{"text":"Angel's Diner is now called \"Fifties Diner\", but has not really changed much.  Although I work literally across the street, I rarely visit.

The menu offers a variety of the regular greasy items you would expect from a diner, nothing out of the ordinary.  I've tried their breakfast, a BLT and their fish & chips and they were all decent, but nothing to rave about.  The portions were a good size - I have never left hungry.

The prices were mid-range, not a steal, but also affordable.  

Interesting:  I've spotted Elvis Stojko here a couple of times."}
{"text":"Funky little joint with a decent breakfast/brunch menu. I had the eggs Benedict. It came with a good size helping of potatoes on the side which were good (not amazing but solid!). Hollandaise was a bit acidic, egg was poached just right. Good if you're hungover or need a brunch fix!"}
{"text":"Wow.  That sucked. Dirty, chipped and down right disgusting glassware and plates. Service was so slow. Girls hanging out in the empty serving room that had no one in it, where you could see them. You had to ask for everything. Pancakes were dense, dry and falling apart. It was so bad out kid looked at us and said he did not like it. We are bringing them home for the dog. Our eggs were over cooked and the home fries tasted like vinegar. PLT?  Really?  Two pieces of bacon two small pieces of tomato lettuce on toast. No seasoning, no mayo, nothing. Don't waste your time or money folks."}
{"text":"What can I say?  This is being reviewed for what it is:   a diner!   Classic diner fair served in a clean establishment with good service.  I've been coming for years with my family and work associates for primarily breakfast and all agree it's one of the best for that in Town."}
{"text":"What is it about the combination of crimson and seafoam that urges me to violence? Kitsche drives me krazy sometimes. Formica-topped tables with embedded sparkles? Who buys this ish? Even octagenarians must find this tackiness rage-inducing. It makes me want to grab the designer by his pencil-thin ankles and swing him Olympically at this restaurant's interior -- taking care to smash his caterwauling head into every one of the seventy-three images of Elvis gracing the walls.

So if you're jonesing to pretend you're in your high school's version of Grease -- hop in your car and avoid all the stop signs along the way. If you're hungry however, you could do better. The food is pretty ordinary, with prices neither too high nor too low. I would hesitate to say \"just right,\" though. It's OK.

Obligatory Title Pun: Fifties? More like FOOD-TEASE.

Menu Readability: Sorry, I'm still \"All Shook Up\" from my rant.

Need to mention: The Jukebox is out of order.

What this place teaches me about myself: If I were a supervillain, my costume would be the colour of a 1950s hair salon."}
