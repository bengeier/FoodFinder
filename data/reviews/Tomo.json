{"text":"I have had great dinning experience at Tomo since 2002. I recommend, the volcano, the chief salad, chicken teriyaki, sushis and sashimis. Food is great and service is usually excellent. There were a few times that the service was slow."}
{"text":"The food (sushis) are excellent. I have only good thing to tell about the presentation of the meal and the taste of every combination.
 
However, the service in one of the most unprofessional i have seen in my whole life. An incompetent waitress drop the liquid of a plate content INSIDE my shoes. Their actions to settle were totally useless and unacceptable for the kind of restaurant they are trying to be. Like if it wasn't enough, our waiter kick the wine basket full of ice and water directly on our seat. Again, their actions to solve the situation weren't enough in any ways. Even talking to the manager didn't yield any better result, proof that they don't actually care about their customer.
 
Even if the food is good, i will never go again in this restaurant and i'm not recommending anybody to go there either. The personnel is just totally unfit for the level of standing this restaurant is trying to be."}
{"text":"Very good food, service, all the employees are very kind. Probably one of my favourite sushi places. In a very conviennent spot for business. Restaurant also looks very good."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI  PLACE EVER

They make the best sushi period.
If you are looking for the best sushi in Quebec then u must try Tomo.

A bit pricey but worth it.
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Nous étions à proximité du Tomo pendant deux jours. Nous y sommes donc allés une première fois, pour y retourner aussi le lendemain! Nous avons très bien mangé, les portions sont généreuses et avons été très bien servi par Carolane; elle a eu d'ailleurs de très bons conseils pour l'alcool, les plats et le dessert! Je n'avais jamais goûté le sake; n'hésitez pas à lui en faire part!

Nous avons apprécié plus particulièrement les poulet aux arachides, le poulet gingembre, sushis pink moon et 8e merveille. En ce qui concerne le dessert, la crème glacée frite au gingembre est excellente; peut être demander sans sirop pour ceux qui ont le goût moins sucré!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we heard good things about this place. We called ahead to see if they had room. We lucked out and got a table. Nice decor and well spaced out. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable. They have a good selection of sushi, entrees and hot dishes. The staff was quite busy but still managed to serve us well. The specialty sushis are to die for. The 8th wonder, Crazy Roll and Blue Moon were all devine. The only thing is that they are a little expensive. We are coming back because it was so good."}
{"text":"\"You're simply the best, better than all the rest...\" lalala

For years the past ten years, my whole family now does not look into trying other places...when we want sushi, we go Tomo. 

The staff is absolutely welcoming, the service is superb and the sushis? Well, they raise the bar pretty high!

To be discovered!"}
{"text":"Je suis allé dîner chez tomo. Le menu midi est intéressant. Les suschis sont très frais, bien présentés avec un goût délicat mais quand même bien présent. Restaurant avec bel ambiance, service attentionné. Je recommande."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi spots off the island, Tomo has a variety of sushi but you must try the specialty sushi they are delicious, freshly made and they make u want to come back for more. 

The only down side is the price, it can get pricey of you start ordering a lot of there specialties and the fact that hey close daily early even on the weekends.They also have a private  dining area which is great for larger groups. Check this place out when in the Rosemere/blainville area!"}
{"text":"Ok. Great disappointment after reading some really good ratings. That said all the sushi and sashimi dishes were excellent but their noodle and pad Thai was terrible. Food was some cold shrimp and chicken when it should have been hot. Can't figure that out because beef in same dish was perfect. Waiter forgot to even serve miso soup and would have forgotten dessert was included if we hadn't literally chased him down. Service was terrible plus had screaming baby next to us. Won't be there agin."}
{"text":"J'ai découvert ce resto avec ma soeur suite à notre escapade au Spa Le Finlandais.  Le décor zen et la luminosité du resto nous a plu. Les sushis sont impeccables.  Nous y étions pour le lunch. Ma soeur a pris le combo sushi B... le tartare y est très généreux et c'est assurément ce que je vous recommande. Le rouleau impérial qui accompagne le combo est irresistible. Pour ma part, j'ai pris le sushi Blue Moon : une expérience gustative inoubliable.  De plus, le serveur connaissait très bien le menu et a su bien nous conseiller pour la sélection des plats. J'y retournerai bientôt !"}
