{"text":"Fish and chips are VERY salty. The service was really bad :(. However, the j√§gerschnitzel was very good. Maybe stick to the \"German eats\" if you dine here!"}
{"text":"The most unsatisfying Brunch I've ever had with the most flavourless Omelette ever, I expect this from Denny's but not Wurst.    When I told the server about the weak Omelette, who in turn grabbed the manager,  who's response was \"Have you ever had Bratwurst before?\"   I have had Bratwurst, thanks for asking, but your server called this Bawa or some other unintelligible gibberish.     I do NOT believe the customer is always right but I do believe that you should always treat the customer with respect and I felt that the manager was not treating me with respect at all.    I returned the uneaten Omelette and was rewarded with 25% off the Omelette. I hope the margin you made on that was worth me and crew never returning.    You get 2 stars because the Mimosa was good."}
{"text":"Our company holiday lunch was held at WURST, and I was overly impressed with the service and the food/drinks. We were initially seated upstairs, which was nice and quiet, but several of us were blinded by the sun's reflection (no blinds), so we had to move downstairs. The lower level is not the most suitable place for discussion with the entire table, only those next to you since you'd lose a lung yelling across the table.  The menu had a lot of sharing options as well as individual plates. I wanted to taste everyone's dish at my table and around me since everything looked so good. I tried the scallops, and it was just enough for me (but may be a bit small for men or if I was starving).  Our waitress was wonderful, and I'd definitely return for a date night."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying I loved the venue but we kept running into problems and I began to lose faith. I feel really sad giving this rating because I have heard nothing but awesome things about Wurst, hopefully my next visit can change my mind. A few friends arrived around 7pm at Wurst to grab a table they were told that nothing would be available till around 10:30. So they put their names down for later and we killed some time at another venue close by.  10:30 rolled around and we headed back to Wurst. I really wanted a good pint of beer and some dessert. We were celebrating a friend's birthday and he really wanted to go. We were told they had no idea what we were talking about when we told them we had names down for a group of 7. We spoke to many different staff members who all insisted there was no one on a list by the name we had given. After standing outside in the chilly night air for almost half an hour they let us go into the venue. I don't even know if it was figured out I just know I was happy to go inside the warm building.  We sat down at the table and began looking at the beer menus. The server came by and was in a fake polite mood. Smiling but rolling her eyes when someone asked her a question. (Sorry we didn't memorize the menu.) We had a fairly big group but we were organized and fun natured not rowdy. I could tell right away she was annoyed with our group. She took our orders so quickly she left before the other half of the table had a chance to utter a word and we tried to wave her over to come back since we weren't done but she did not return till some of our drinks came.  Again we ordered some food (the rest of our drinks) and were hoping to get some desserts. Two of our guests ordered a meal while the rest of us were craving something sweet. Again the waitress left before we could even ask her what they were offering for dessert. Finally we got her attention with one of my friends physically tapping her to turn around she came back very angry. Spit out the dessert offerings so fast we all looked at her as if she were speaking in tongues.  I split the apple crisp with my significant other. It wasn't my favourite I felt I could have done a better job making it from scratch at home. Maybe it was the bad taste left in my mouth from our server though. The beer I ordered however was awesome. I love dark beer and I think I could have enjoyed almost every single beer on the list.  I really did love this venue. The upstairs was cozy and fun and the basement was a riot I felt like I was back in Europe I felt very at home. However I was not impressed with the service. Everyone in our group picked up on her attitude and yes I do feel bad if she was going through some tough things however I have worked in the service industry for four years and have always kept my cool in front of my customers (even when they were screaming in my face).  Although we were a big group and I understand they can be tough to handle we didn't like feeling so rushed and we clearly were a burden to our server which was reflected strongly when it came to paying our tab. I would go back to Wurst again I just hope when it comes to eating a meal there I don't have to feel like I'm competing in a 100 yard dash to place my order."}
{"text":"Very well selected beer menu. The black forest dessert is divine, and makes the perfect ending to your meal. The portions are generous.  Food is good, but not gourmet.  Very traditional authentic German (Bavarian) Hofbrau Haus food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome !!! Had the schnitzel chips to start, then moved on to the 1/2 dozen oysters , and the finale pork hock mixed veggie and purple sauerkraut that was top 5 meal I have ever had ! Great atmosphere great service amazing food and beer!! I will be setting up a tent at this spot!"}
{"text":"Great service!! Went for burger fest and the pork burger was amazing. Flavourful juicy and perfectly balanced. The decor is beautiful the trees with the lights are gorge. It was just an amazing experience. Thanks wurst for the great night out!!"}
{"text":"I held my book launch at Wurst Wunderbar. Great service and the event went beautifully. Lots of people had meals upstairs and at the event. Delicious. Wunderbar!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love going to this place for the boot beers. Although less economical then two one leaders, you sure do feel like a badass drinking one of one of these bad boys.   I ate there for the first time last night and must say that it was quite delicious buy a tad on the pricey side.. I had the schnitzel tachos and they were good. The schnitzel couldve been a little warmer, but I really enjoyed all of the flavors. The avacado also was a nice surprise and worked well with the other ingridients. The sauce that accompanied the nachos had a nice spicy kick. I wouldnt put too much on because it will over power the other ingridients.   I am fortunate enough to have friends who will let me snag a bite from their dish. I tried the rib eye and was blown away by it. The meat was so tender that it melted in your mouth. The side of arugula also added a geeat element to the meal (you make the dish into sandwhich). My buddy enjoyed the dish so much so that he ordered it again later on in the evening  My other friend got the schnitzel and was sariafied by his dish as well. I sampled it and was impressed.   Wurst is expensive, but the portions are large. Its a great beer hall to go with a large group or a couple of buddys, but if your on a tight budget you might be going home drunk and hungry"}
{"text":"I'm from Bavaria, Germany and on holiday in Canada. My friends told me I should check out the WURST to get food that feels like home. And it did.  When the chef found out that I'm from Germany and 'testing' the food, he came up to my table and we had a very nice talk  The food was awesome. The sausage, calamari and the schnitzel has been awesome and the service was nice."}
{"text":"So a few weeks ago, while on business in Calgary, a few locals offered to meet us for snacks and pints and suggested this place.  Our hotel was a short cab ride away, so we agreed.  Also - i am a beer-hound, so it seemed appropriate.  When I got there, I discovered that we probably should have made a reservation.   I arrived a half hour before we were to meet our clients, and they were already rammed.   The locals told us to head to the basement and find a table there.   We went down there, and 2 pints later, we finally picked up the tab for a group in exchange for first dibs on their booth.     This place was classic German.  In Germany, this type of place would be full of old dudes slamming pints, but this place was full of college kids and 20-somethings.  Not an issue, as it just made for greater entertainment later in the evening.  Slightly classier that anything similar in Germany (even with the picnic tables in the basement), the food was Epic, and the beers were perfect.  We only had apps to eat, but they were the perfect mix of German and delicious.  Soft Pretzels, and amazing Wings. After 2 pints and 2 \"Boots\", i barely remember leaving, but i do recall the Oompa-oompa band doing their rounds around this place and cheering on anyone brave enough to try to down a 1-litre boot of German Wheat beer (which was incredible, I'll add).    Recommendation - try the wings.   Pretzel-breaded, stuff with sausage, and deep fried/tossed in sauce.   A little piece of German-made-heaven.  Seriously."}
{"text":"I always have a good time at Wurst! The staff is so friendly and helpful. My friend and I didn't like the wine we ordered and they gave us another bottle. They have a great selection of beers as well. I am vegetarian so the food menu is not for me but otherwise go for it! Music is always good! I highly recommend the place."}
{"text":"Yes, I just gave a place five stars. Simmer down.  Chelsea selected Wurst as the location for this month's Boys Club, a gathering of tech/web/creative/social media women in Calgary.   We were, quite fortunately, accompanied by Sarah Ward (a.k.a. @frecklesandash), the restaurant's interior designer.  We sat in The Vol Room, decorated with an extremely large painting of a pig and tastefully appointed with modern lighting, seats and tables.  We all remarked on the wood panels adorning the walls and ceiling. Sarah let us know the rustic approach was quite intentional, to give that old German bier haus feel, and the wood came from a 300-year-old barn in Quebec.  Our server, Andrea, was fantastic. This was -- head and shoulders -- the best service experience I've had in Calgary in a good long while. She knew the menu inside and out, forward and backward. She told us when she found out she was getting hired full time, she made sure she sampled everything on the menu.  She was not only knowledgeable about the menu, but she was pleasant and quick. She also apologized profusely when a beer or wine of choice was not available that evening.  For the food, we started with the charcuterie and it was wolfed down in no time. Andrea explained each item on the board but the second I hear 'brie' there doesn't seem to be anything else worth eating.  I. Love. Brie.  Next came my schweinhauxen, or pork knuckle. Be careful with the pronunciation and do not order a sheizenhauxen, because then you'll get a shit knuckle.  First the accessories ... braised red cabbage, a touch too much of pickle flavouring or something, I can't quite put my finger on it. A small dollop of clumpy mashed potatoes.  So yeah, meh.  But the pork knuckle was as delicious as it was HUGE. There was more than enough for a go-box and I had one happy puppy when I got home.  For dessert, I went for the white chocolate mousse (yummm ... Andrea's favourite). The presentation is adorable, coming in a glass jar - complete with lid - and three cookies. It was pretty good, not very rich at all but not enough cookies to go with the amount of mousse.  In all, a delightful evening. I look forward to a return visit to try the Pile of Bratwurst."}
{"text":"Wurst is the best ( German beer hall ) that I have been to . I went here sight unseen for my GF's Friends birthday or something like that , the details escape me . I was met by a pleasant atmosphere and the sight of people drinking out of shoes....then it hit me that's no Shoe that's DAS BOOT ! and I must have one.   I ordered a boot of a delightful Pilsner and was given the option of plastic or glass; I opted for the Glass (50$ deposit ) because I'm not a child and It's hard to impress total strangers with your drinking prowess if you're imbibing from what amounts to a sippy cup.   If you are a fan of  various organ meats in intestinal casings then you will love the menu because it's pretty preserved meats and sausage heavy. I ordered wings and was treated to this bizarre chicken wing/ sausage on a drumstick concoction. 3 to an order , pretzle breaded, covered in hot sauce and massive in size, oh and actually pretty tasty.  The Polka band touring around was great ! it added so much to the ambiance and through the bleary beer induced haze was probably more enjoyable then it should have been.   *****Missing Scene*******"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect.. German and all. I love German food but it can be bland,  this was different. It was modern or upscale German and delicious. The place was hopping busy, and the Atmos was great.  The service - at least our server was way above and beyond. Cheeky, witty yet attentive. I love a place that has the energy this place has. It would seem resv are necessary because everyone has discovered the place."}
{"text":"After three less than memorable visits to this restaurant I'm still not sure what is going on in the kitchen but it doesn't work for me. Supposedly the theme is German but it isn't German food a German would recognize as such. Some of the menu and flavour combinations are just downright odd.  For example, I love mashed potatoes and eat them a lot but mashed potatoes heavily seasoned with nutmeg? Huh? How about bratwurst, a German delicacy. OK but really spicy bratwurst? Doesn't work at all. I think I've given this place a fair shot but the steep prices combined with the less than enjoyable dishes won't have me coming back."}
{"text":"Having spent entirely too much time in Bavarian beer halls, I must say that Wurst recreates the experience as good as I have ever seen.  Right down to the food, which I will say is a cut above anything I have ever had in Germany.  Particular mention has to be made to the kitchen and head chef for sourcing all of the ingredients locally, from the pork to the pickles, it's all lovingly prepared and broken down onsite.  The beer menu is outstanding and appeals to all appetites and I was impressed with the wine list.  Not being a fan of the sweeter wines, I'm not too concerned if the list doesn't contain to many Gerwurtz' or Reislings.    I think this is a good, if not great, concept that represents an authentic and high end dining experience that is worthy of any multi-star experience I have had in other global food cities.  Well done Wurst"}
{"text":"Went to Wurst for my girlfriend's 30th. Its the first time I've seen the building since its transformation. Its really beautiful. It's rustic, feel with modern touches. The place was packed on a saturday night, our reservation was at 8 pm.  Even though the menu is meat heavy, there are  a lot of seafood options and maybe one(?) veggie option.  We all ordered only apps to start, and I had the Octopus Salad, with the charred tomato vinagrette. The Octopus was tender, just enough vinagrette so it wasnt drowning. It came with a salad, with tomato and avocado..which was delicious.  Some of the apps the guys at the table got, were MASSIVE. They didnt bother ordering mains, because the starters were so filling.  The Bavarian wings are stuffed with sausage looked like they each weighed 2 pounds. They were delicious, and the mustard they served with it was nice and tangy.  The shortribs were also tender and the portion size huge. The chef was overly generous with the sauce, but having said that, it was good sauce! Smoky, yet not too sweet.  One of the guys ordered the prime rib...it looked like they served him up a half cow. It came with a ton of mashed potato, veggies and Yorkshire pudding.  I wont go on about what everyone else ordered, but I will say that we were all happy with our food, and our server Mike was OUTSTANDING. Some of the best service Ive had in a while, so thanks Mike."}
{"text":"Good food, pricey beer though.  You get good size portion.  I had the bratwurst platter and loved the sausages."}
{"text":"A solid German restaurant that sticks to crowd favorite meat and potato fare at a fair price. Most portions are substantial given the heavy nature of the food...I challenge anyone to finish the brunch poutine in one sitting! There is usually a line for brunch unless you get the early, and same goes for the communal table beer hall downstairs on weekend nights where stein holding contests, boot-drinking and standing on the tables are de rigeur. The south-facing patio is a nice alternative during the summer months if you don't want to be accosted by the oompah band. This place is A-OK, so as per Yelp's scale, three stars."}
{"text":"$45 for beer and sub par schnitzel. Wont be back for dinner, maybe for drinks.   Having traveled in Germany and Austria, one develops an appreciation for schnitzel. For those who haven't had a chance to visit the land of beer and quality engineering, schnitzel is pork that has been flattened so that it is evenly thin and very crispy when fried. Schnitzel is supposed to be the size of your dinner plate with maybe an accompaniment of some fries or veggies. WURST's rendition makes a mockery of Germany's greatest food. Between the 3 schnitzels ordered, there may have been 6oz of meat. That is an average of 2 ounces per disk for ~$25 a person. For that price, I should be eating caviar rather than pork.   The beer is good and comes in German sized steins (get the 1 or 2L). You are definitely paying for the experience of drinking in a beer hall though as 1L mugs will run you ~$20 with 2L steins at ~$30.   11/30"}
{"text":"Came to Wurst for a special dinner a few weeks ago. I love the huge food and drink menu. I can be a bit of a picky eater so I appreciate having so many choices.   My BF and I shared the cast iron ribs with smoked beer sauce, the Bavarian wings (pretzel breaded and stuffed with sausage), and the Caesar salad. I probably wouldn't order the ribs again, they were a bit too fatty, and the bone was kind of falling apart. The wings were much larger than we were expecting, and there was really not a lot of chicken meat; probably 90% sausage : 10% chicken. I think the chicken wing is really just a vessel for the delicious sausage... The hot sauce on the outside of the \"wings\" combined with the mustard dipping sauce was very good. The Caesar salad was milder than most, our server informed us that the dressing is made without anchovies. I really liked the peppercorn dressing.   The drink menu is fantastic. I tried a beer cocktail which I think was called The Nikki. I don't see it on the online menu and I can't remember exactly what was in it. I think it was Wurst 1516 lager, grapefruit soda, and peach schnapps. So yummy. I also tried the Sir Perry Pear Cider. I really like the 200 ml draft servings. It's a great way to try multiple beers without getting wasted and/or full...   Our server was great. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave us some good suggestions. She stopped us from ordering a third meat dish to share, which I am very thankful for. We couldn't even finish the two that we ordered.   There is definitely not enough parking in their private lot. Street parking and paid parking lots are close by."}
{"text":"Name should be WORST.   I was not not aware that they are owned by the group that runs Mercato. The service was good but the servers had way too many tables to look after. Food was mediocre and inadequate serving size. $80.00 for a seafood tower for 2 that is certainly a rip off. Server says that you get half a lobster as well. we got a half of a head shell with a small claw in it. a real joke. don't wear your good clothes because you will SMELL after you leave.certainly not coming back but the atmosphere is very good similar too its over priced sister---Mercato."}
{"text":"I had heard excellent things about Wurst and couldn't wait to try it. I arrived and loved the restaurant - the trees inside with lights made for a great setting. I was seated while I waited for my friends to arrive. My server was very attentive and quite lovely at first. She was lovely all the way through, but not accommodating. I asked about a substitution and she said no, but I should try to taste one of my friend's meals that was going to have the same thing on it. So much for customer friendly... anyhow, was excited for my food to arrive and although the presentation was beautiful, the food was very average and expensive (like on par with Centini's). I had the trout which came served on vegis (which were delicious), but the fish was very bland and a little over cooked. Anyhow, I'm not sure I would go back for dinner. I've heard their brunch is good and will give it a try, maybe. But I think I would only ever come back for a drink in the evening as their dinner was bland and way over priced."}
{"text":"A group of us were there for a birthday party and when we got there we were greeted by a  door man with a chip on his shoulder.  We asked to speak with management and we're treated like we were idiot (he never did get someone for us). It is really to bad because the place was a great time and our server was amazing. I just believe that a first impression is everything and this person is not what I would want as the face of my business. I had been looking forward to the reopening for a long time and to be treated this way leaves a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Can't speak to the food but after waiting for a table for 45 minutes and then having it taken by someone who just walked in the door was very frustrating.  Having a hostess downstairs from 6-9 and implementing a wait list probably wouldn't be that hard."}
{"text":"This place is the \"wurst\" for customer service. We went in and were seated in a mostly empty place. We were given menus and told our server would be right there. We waited. And waited. And waited. Not a big deal until a table of six arrived and was seated right beside us. The weren't even done getting their coats off, and the waiter was over with water and drink orders. Walked past us twice. Looked at us twice. And kept walking. Finally we just got up, told the hostess what happened, and left. I sure hope your food is better than your service. We will never know because we won't be back."}
{"text":"Horrible. Bad food. Bad service. Parking is ridiculous. Only good thing is the napkins and beer. Which the beer is totally overpriced."}
{"text":"Wurst has really gone downhill since it reopened which is sad because it was one of my favourites pre-flood! They changed up the menu & the beer. But sadly everything I've ordered on the new menu has been very bland while also being very pricey.   Word to the wise, stay a away from the grilled cheese sliders- 'but why? Grilled cheese sliders sound delicious- what could possibly go wrong?' Ya I don't know but these sliders are skin to eating buttered wonderbread with nothing else on it..... I think they need to taste test new menu items.   The last 4 times I have tried to visit during the week for dinner it's also been either completely closed for a private function or the downstairs has been closed. Very frustrating - I have no patience for a business that wastes my time by turning me away for a private function on 4 separate occasions! It makes me sad to say but I won't be back for a 5th rejection guys :("}
{"text":"I went here for drinks and dinner on a Friday night and I have to say that I was impressed.  First off, the atmosphere was awesome, it was a mix of a nice dinning room up top and an old fashioned Bavarian beer hall in the basement.  It wasn't too noisy in the dinning hall, which was nice.  They had a group of four people going around in lederhosen preforming various old German tunes, which added the cultural touch.  The food selection was good.  I had the burger and must say, it was one of the best I have ever had.  The food was a little on the pricey side but it is to be expected given the theme and atmosphere.  The beer selection was superb, multiple different types both international and domestic.  They also serve beer in both 1L cups and 2L beer boots.  Word of advice, the beer boots may seem cool, but purchase at your own risk as it is likely that your beer is going to get room temperature by the time you hit the heel of your glass.  All in all, it was a pretty good experience and I would highly recommend it, just be aware of the prices."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about Wurst and was excited to try it, I think I have been there three times and then haven't really been back. The first two were just for drinks and snacks so I didn't get much of an impression, beer selection was good their pretzels are really tasty and the waitresses outfits are very cute, German style dresses.  However I went there one night for dinner with my husband, brother and his girlfriend and was very disappointed with the food. We both decided that the \"schnitzel for two\" looked like the best choice, and each couple ordered that to share between them. It sounded like it was going to be more of a meal, but it was really just a huge slab if pork schnitzel with a small bowl of a sour kraut coleslaw stuck in the middle. not only was one schnitzel big enough to feed four, I had no interest in eating that much oil meat and breadcrumb in one sitting, even if I could.  Needless to say I went home and cooked some veggies and haven't been back since, I don't feel like I was served a proper meal, and we all felt a little ripped off."}
{"text":"One of my most memorable Father's Days of all time. Great beer, bratwurst, decor, service and crowd. WURST has a great feel to it."}
{"text":"When I walked in I was struck by the amazing tree they have in there with the twinkling lights, very creative! Good food, only a little too fatty. Our waiter was extremely nice, took his time by explaining the menu to us, as we had a lot of questions. The ambience is really nice.. well over all I'll definitely come back to Wurst."}
{"text":"Good calamari....got the sausage platter for main.  Sausages were ok but didn't really seem homemade. Liked the selection of mustards but the potatoes and sauerkraut were pretty bland. The service and excellent beer definitely bumped the score to a 4 star. I'd probably go back but won't be breaking the door down."}
{"text":"They literally have the worst possible staff running their wait list. They don't comprehend that it's first come first serve and they just let themselves get steamrolled. You should fire your front door staff."}
{"text":"THE chilli bacon calamari, which was on the list of 62 things to eat and drink in Calgary before you die. A $ 16 dish that did not taste like anything but soggy calamari. What a disappointment.  Dom burger which was on special tonight for $10. Probably the thickest patty I had yet at a pub but the patty was on the dry side. Can't really complain for $10 burger"}
{"text":"I have gone twice in past month and ate upstairs.  The food is satisfying (sausage platter 1st time, schnitzel BLT 2nd time). Hardy heavy food which hits a hungry stomach well.    My last time at Wurst, our drinks took a long time to come (over 20 minutes) we didn't make any comment but the waitress was very apologetic and took care of our first round.  This appreciative gesture will make me return.  Good food, great service, casual vibe."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place for German food and drink. Ladies be prepared because this isn't really the place you go to for a light meal. If you are ready for a hearty meal this is the place to go to. Beer is available in small sampler flights or 2L boots. Downstairs is more of the beer hall atmosphere and upstairs has a nice restaurant feel to it. This place is definitely on my list of favs for Calgary dining."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner because I wanted to experience Schnitzel...and I am still on the hunt for a proper Schnitzel. Wurst is a good looking place which tries to cover the fact that there food is not so up to par. I mentioned to one of the staff that I did not enjoy my meal and she just shrugged it off trying to defend the place. The portion sizes are not that great either for a \"German\" bar restaurant, so don't go if you are looking for a good German meal. The service  was great though."}
{"text":"We'd heard so much about Wurst we figured we just had to check it out. The place was pretty busy on a Sunday night but we got a table on the main floor and dug into the menu. Unfortunately a few things we wanted were sold out, mostly seafood, so we had to settle for some of the waiter's recommendations.  The \"Bavarian Wings\", a sausage-stuffed wings appetizer, was truly vile. Jumbo wings (turkey wings, possibly) arrived in a skillet absolutely coated in greasy-looking buffalo sauce atop a fried \"pretzel crumb\" coating. They were tough (nearly too tough to cut through with a knife) and the \"chicken\" meat was crumbly and dry. The sausage was nearly flavorless under that thick coating of buffalo sauce. Very disappointing.  My dinner guest ordered the Thuringer Brat and was equally disappointed in the overly dry, flavorless sausages he was presented with.  My main of prime rib was a huge, fatty slab of meat. The meat was undersalted (I felt like a Food Network judge saying \"this needs more seasoning\") and the side vegetables were bitter, overcooked, and limp.   Our waiter was completely distracted and several times forgot to bring us things he had promised - more water, the bill, the credit card machine.   Definitely more hype than content."}
{"text":"Man I'm getting old , this place has the hardest seats on earth my ass still hurts two days later , we were sitting 8 at a table and it was so noisy I couldn't talk to the person two down from me .  The service was pretty good once they gave us a waitress but when we first went in we had to get our own drinks cause we were thirsty and ain't no one care .  The food is the worst German food I've ever had , it is like something you would get at a cheap banquet where they prepare everything the day before and re heat it ..the snitzel was grislty ( is that a word? ) and the breading was greasy and tasteless, horrible .. the red cabbage was microwaved so hot that me and my wife both took a fork full and burned the sh@$ out of our mouths , maybe that's the strategy so you can't tell how tasteless everything Is . Spatzel .... cmon man pan fry that stuff it's was like eating paste once again no taste . Just a lousy lousy all around lousy night out .  I do not recommend if you want to talk to friends or have a good meal , if you just want to drink and listen to an oompah band this is for you ."}
{"text":"I go inside and I instantly LOL. Yes, it does actually look like an outdoor beer garden in Germany, but this is not an outdoor beer garden, or Germany, or Dubai. This is Calgary and we are indoors. No restaurant in Germany is going to decorate themselves like this. Yet this place decorates a German exterior into an interior, which is ridiculous. Apparently you cannot just have a good German restaurant and kinda make it your own. Oh no, you have to mimick something else, otherwise you can't justify $40 a plate.   We instantly go downstairs. Again, kinda mimicking the German Beer Hall look, but not as abrasively. I love the benches, it forces people to share shit, which Calgarians seem really reluctant to do. The kitchen has a wide open view of the place, which is SOOOOOOOOOOOO vancouver/unoriginal/retarded. The kitchen is the place you hide in a restaurant; not expose pretentiously.   The TVs are lame as well, but, I've bitched about this relentlessly towards every bar in this city, so, you know. But credit to them: the volume is loooow and therefore people were talking at a normal tone instead of shouting like baggage handlers around an aircraft engine.   I thought a beer would calm my nerves. I do not see a waitress so I assume this is a 100% authentic German beer hall where you just go get your own fucking drinks and tip them nothing because everything is so fucking expensive and the service is mechanical and bureaucratic at best (which it was at this place! 5 stars for German authenticity!). I look at the beer list, and good fucking lord, each beer is $9 and up.  So I say: \"ok, what's on special?\" Bartender says: \"creemore springs!\" I say: \"yehyeeehh!\" Bartender proceeds to wash glass, I realize something terrible and intervene \"Uh, how much would that be?\" \"$6.50\" \"HAHAAH for some shitty beer from southern ontario?\" \"yep\" \"hahahaha fuck that\".  We fucking leave. $6.50 is the cheapest domestic beer, \"on special\". this place is really trying to mimic the German beer hall experience, right down to the pricing...but of course, tips are expected. fuck off. i'll buy some Hacker Pschorr from co-op and drink them in the parking lot behidn this establishment....drinking behind high end beer halls: also an authentic german experience! BUT AT A TENTH OF THE COST!"}
{"text":"Wurst wins hands-down for \"wurst\" attempt at a German eatery. We ordered the Wurst special for March... it was a three-course meal that started off with a duck-slice salad doused in a ketchup-type dressing (too expensive for such a small portion of meat.) The main course was a cast iron dish full of over-salted meat (dinky 3\" \"bratwurst\" sausage, non-German flavored lean porkchop, chunk of smoked back bacon or Slanina as we Serbs like to call it), Russian (purple) potatoes (which aren't exotic, by the way... my mother grows these in Calgary), mystery vegetables (half-cooked Radishes? I don't know... it was so dark I couldn't really see my food) and over-salted/weirdly spiced saurkraut. The last dish was a Black Forest Cake experiment gone wrong.  The food is really not German at all... it is too salty, too spiced and not simple enough. Saurkraut should be sour... not pure salt. Meat should taste like meat... not pure salt. Black Forest Cake should have a hint of Kirsch... not be soaked in vodka.  This place is way overpriced. Dinner for husband and I came to around $100 for Dennys-quality food. A real shame... for these high-end prices, I expect a 100% flawless meal and experience... not pub food/atmosphere.  Anyway, if you want to experience real \"German\" food, try Edelweiss for lunch, and also give The Austrian Club (NE Industrial area) a shot. It's not in a fancy area like Wurst is (Mission... probably one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the city) but is superior in taste. Great for weddings too.  I'm not sure I like the overall concept of Wurst. There is a noisy bar downstairs and a restaurant upstairs. Problem is... in the restaurant upstairs, the downstairs bar noise overpowers everything.... even the Lederhosen-dressed \"live music\" that walks around playing different tunes (Birthday tunes mostly) is drowned out by the club-type music and very LOUD people downstairs."}
{"text":"The service was excellent! We started with a group of three and people kept joining until we were six. As soon as we sat town the waitress brought us water and kept our glasses filled all night. When we neared the end of a bottle of HALF PRICE bottles of wine every Thursday, she asked if we wanted more. The pretzel was massive and delicious! It was plenty for an appetizer for three. It came with three delicious drips, one that deceived you as mustard and burned like wasabi. Be warned. All in all, efficient and pleasant servers with very reasonably priced half price wine."}
{"text":"How I've never been to Wurst is beyond me. I seriously had the best time here for a DateNight Trivia event.  Since there was a no cell phone policy for the event, it was unsettling for me that I couldn't take a photo of the giant pretzel I had. HOW WILL PEOPLE VISUALLY ENJOY MY FOOD WITH ME?! #YelperProblems lol  Seriously though, the pretzel was everything you wanted it to be. Doughy inside with crispy outside crusted with sea salt. The grainy mustards, chutney and butter were primo additions to the pretzel. Had this pretzel been accompanied with some spicy pepperoni or cured deli meat I woulda been in food heaven.  Seeing how our team won GCs for winning first place (YEAHHHH), it was a surefire way of luring me back. Maybe next time I can get photographic evidence to share with my fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst customer service I've ever had in my life. You wait in line to get inside and then are put in another line to then wait again to get downstairs to the \"dance bar\" (which is super lame if you've ever been to a real city where there are actual dance clubs). And then you wait for like another hour to get told that you're not actually in line for the downstairs bar. So you basically wait for 2 hours to just somewhere else. I live in Calgary. I've been here for 6 years. I've tried Wurst a few times and I'll never go there again."}
{"text":"Love it here! Both the beer hall and upstairs are great! Wonderful service and fantastic food! Fun atmosphere, even better music. We ordered mostly appetizers, and split a main meal between the two of us, that way we got to try a bit of everything."}
{"text":"My wife, arrived with family and friends for a world cup. They lost their reservation?? right? They gave it away it seems.  Parking you need to pay for so $50 plus for beer, food each and yet pay for parking. Not great!!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best place to get winers in Calgary! I love all the choices they have and the different dips that come with. I really enjoy the flavourful sausages that you can get. If your not feeling that hungry grab a pretzel and a beer everything is nicely priced so nothing is to expensive. Great place for an interesting date night cause they always have events going on"}
{"text":"Food was good but not really authentic. tbh the beers I tried weren't that good bar one (I got the sample tray).I've lived in Germany and they could import better but the waitress was nice"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times did not go so well.  First off they have a good selection of beers but it is a lot than most other bars in that area and even 17th.   When I was there in November I was there with a friend and the very large both under the stairs by 8.00 over half a dozen customers had come over asking when we were leaving and it makes no sense to sit there with only two people.  We left getting sick of people bothering us and when I was leaving the GM a lady said next time I go back they will sort things out.  It seems now the rules have changed they now want a credit card if you order a boot which it 2 liters of beer. What happens if you go to chat at another table and it gets smashed then yes you get charged.  It is also a case that they will not tell you you are being charged you will just see it on your statement.  On another night I had a few liters to drink go my bill paid and went to leave once outside is when one of the doormen pushed me several times overall not great place will not go back save your time and money."}
{"text":"After wanting to try Wurst for quite some time I finally got the opportunity to sit on their patio and enjoy this establishment.   Wurst has great happy hour specials which I took advantage of...$5 Prosecco anyone? Also since we were there on a Tuesday the food special was $1 oysters and $10 peel and eat shrimp.... Done and done.   I enjoyed these starters and decided to stay in the same vein for my main course which was the Ahi Tuna Tacos.  The tacos did not disappoint and I was very happy with the freshness and flavour! Throughout our visit our server was great and attentive - bonus!  What can I say about my experience? Well, it was Wunderbar!"}
{"text":"I was here in March while visiting friends in town. I didn't have a chance to explore a lot of Calgary but if they're all as cool as this spot (and delicious) well then Calgary... you just made yourself a new BFF.   Seriously, this place took the idea of a German Beer Hall and Gastro-house, flipped it upside down, turned it on it's ear, added two floors, pumped it full of beer and made it into an √úberkitchen, Wunderbar!!!  The decor fits with most of a similar type of restaurant, exposed brick, reclaimed wood, and statues and pictures of pigs everywhere (ok that's a little different). Upstairs is more sit down dining while the lower level is more typical bavarian beer hall with long communal benches. My dudes and I saddled up here - because it's cool to straddle a bench like you're in high school and you \"don't care.\"  For starters we shared an order of their Chilli nachos ($19). Expensive for 'cho's? Yes. Worth it? Well! You know that problem with MOST resto-nachos where the top has cheese, the bottom has toppings, the chips that do have stuff on them are soggy and the ones that don't are so plain their PAINFUL to eat? Yes I've definitely defined a problem - Well... these Nachos, DON'T have that problem. Perfectly topped, layered, cooked, cheesed, sauce, My F$%^& these were good!  How could we ever follow that up? Glad you asked! Why not some of their signature Bavarian wings ($7 each). Pricey? Ya. But is a wing the size of a 1/2 chicken stuffed to capacity with sausage before cooked worth the price? HELL TO THE YES friendo!  By the time our $29 Alberta beef Striploin came out for mains, I really didn't care anymore. I was properly sated and was merely eating for sport or gluttony (#fatguyproblems). Gotta give you Albertans your due, you grill a mean steak - thank you for this!   My only disappointment was my $16 Euro beer flight. Maybe it was the selection that comes standard with this flight, maybe I was too full to enjoy, but it went down really rough and did more harm than good. With so many great beers on tap, I'd be best served next time to enjoy a whole pint of something I know and love already!  Calgary... cherish this place. For the love of god, visit it all the time!!   Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Als Schwabe haben die Maultaschen auf der Karte mein Herz sofort h√∂her schlagen lassen.  Die Rotweinso√üe und dass sie als Appetizer angeboten werden fand ich merkw√ºrdig. Neben den Maultaschen haben wir noch die K√§sesp√§tzle (Fritz Sp√§tzle) und das J√§gerschnitzel probiert. Ich bin mir sicher, dass wir es als gut empfunden h√§tten, wenn wir nicht authentisch deutsches / schw√§bisches Essen erwartet h√§tten. Die Qualit√§t, die Presentation, das Ambiente, der Service ist alles prima - aber die Gerichte hatten absolut nichts zu tun mit Maultaschen, K√§sesp√§tzle oder J√§gerschnitzel."}
{"text":"Wurst is always a good time! Definitely make sure to try the bretzel - but I warn you its huge! Good for sharing! Great food and great atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"I love Wurst.  We go about every second Tuesday and eat a few dozen oysters.. sometimes a poutine.  Service is good, the food is good, prices are reasonable (and darn well fantastic at buck a shuck).. that works for me."}
{"text":"Wurst is a welcome addition to Mission. With communal style seating, good tunes (an occasional German umpa band) and an ample beer selection (including their own Wurst brew choices), it's hard not to have a good time at this bier hall! Be prepared to pay more for a pint of beer (1/2 liter starts at 8.50$; bottles $5.50 and up) and a couple of entrees (between 16-40$/ entree). This isn't your average pub.  I like that Wurst has a dining room upstairs and a communal, \"sit with strangers\"layout downstairs.  The menu is the same in both areas. The food seems to be a modern twist on traditional German-Bavarian-European delicacies. We've tried their \"jager schnitzel with spaetzle\" (great mushroom gravy on thin slices of meat, 23$), sausage-stuffed chicken wings with pretzel coating (3 huge turkey wings for 12$) and their \"schweinshaxen\" (a roasted pork knuckle- it's big enough to share between 2 people for 23$) All of it is delicious!  One area that could be improved/ better: Service. We've experienced inconsistent service from the team at Wurst. The waitresses are friendly when you arrive and apologetic when it takes 10 minutes for them to deliver your first round... Maybe order the 1L stein so you can relax until your next round;-)"}
{"text":"I met up with 2 friends here last night for dinner and drinks and had a great time. It was my friend's idea to go there and I wasn't sure at first because I had been there once before and wasn't overly impressed by it.  Last night however, was a different experience. We sat at a booth and ordered drinks. My friends both ordered the sampler packs, and I was overjoyed when I saw Steigl Radler on their beer menu. They have my favourite beer! And it was only 6.5$, which is considerably cheaper than the other place in town that carries this beer.  On to the food. I ordered the lamb crepe because I had read that it is big enough for a meal. To be safe, I also ordered onion rings. I was hungry, and wanted to make sure my meal was filling. My friends got the prime rib and the bison short ribs. The food came at a decent time, and the portions looked HUGE. My friend's prime rib was a HUGE HUNKERIN' slab of meat. We wondered how the hell he was going to eat that. My lab crepe was a really good, and very tasty. It was savoury, cheesy and very filling. Definitely more of a MEAL than an appetizer. The onion rings were good, but my personal preference leans on the crispier side. I had a bite of my friend's prime rib - and - o.m.g. - I had a moment with that piece of meat in my mouth. My eyes closed, and the noise drowned away for a few seconds.. It made me feel like I hadn't had meat in years. It was juicy, succulent, flavourful, and just really, REALLY GOOD. In fact, I want to tell everyone that anytime you are craving a phenomenal steak/prime rib or anything of that sort, consider Wurst. It is fantastic!   Wurst's menu is very very pig-centric, so I cannot try TOO many things on their menu, but from what I did try, I was definitely impressed. And bonus points for carrying my favourite beer."}
{"text":"I cannot comment on the food, but spent some time there over the holidays downstairs in the beer hall and enjoyed the beer sampler on the house thanks to being with a friend of the venue.  While the beer is good, I opted for a fruity martini.  At $12 a pop it was worth it!  I know... odd for a place boasting about beer."}
{"text":"If you want to have the best breakfast ever, go here. Order the French toast. Gouda...Bacon...Apple slaw...DELICIOUS. Just do it, you will thank me. Might be the best breakfast I have had in Calgary."}
{"text":"So a loud and energizing group downstairs and a casual, welcoming space on the main, all in all, memorable experience.  This neighbourhood stop has a place for everyone, patio, dining, bar and lounge!  The bar team was amazing, sincere and genuinely checking in, the food was very good as well!  Something tells me, it will always be a local fav!"}
{"text":"Small menu for brunch but very tasty. I ordered the eggs Benedict with back bacon and it was cooked perfect. Only wish the dinner items like seafood tower was available to order. Good service and friendly. I would def go back"}
{"text":"Wow. Wurst is the worst. I've lived in Calgary for 27 years and we have some pretty decent night life and restaurants, but Wurst showcases the most unfavourable of calgary's culture. It's like a Tinder playground where you won't feel like you fit in unless you are balls to the wall wasted. Leave your soul and dignity at coat check"}
{"text":"Went for brunch and have to say this place has potential.  Ambiance - 5 stars - very nice upstairs and fun downstairs.  The indoor trees and the rustic decore are very well done.  Music is there but just in the background.  Very beautiful restaurant.  Food - 4.5 stars - We ordered the sausage/bean skillet and duck benedict with some drinks.  Food was very good and great portions.  Price was a bit high but I would call the upstairs upscale dining, so well worth it.  Service - 1 star - We were barely greeted at the front by a woman who, in jeans and a shirt, didn't look or act like she worked there.  Our waitress also ignored us leaving us with empty glasses and regret that we even left a tip.  The place was full but not busy, and 1 waiter/ 5 tables should account for good service.  Having been a waiter I understand bad days and overwork affecting your attitude, but this was just apathy.  Beer - A bit early for us, but the menu looked good and price for 2L is actually a reasonable deal when you do the math ($7.50 a 16oz glass).  I could have given this 4 or even 5 stars with better service, but as it is I will go for the food and leave poor tips for the expected poor service."}
{"text":"I'm downgrading.  The first review I wrote says that the 'pile of bratwurst' is one of the best dishes I've had in a long time.  They really knocked it out of the park that first time, so I went again and ordered the same thing.  It came out so fast that the server made a little joke about how they must've been waiting for me.  I wouldn't be surprised if the dish actually had been waiting for me, because it didn't seem as well put together.  It seemed like the parts of the dish had settled into one another.  They also didn't give me a side of mustard like the first time.  It was still very delicious and the rest of the experience held up, but my food didn't live up to the standard that they had originally set."}
{"text":"This German restaurant has amazing food as well as a lot of choices for beer or wine. Atmoshphere upstairs is a restaurant and downstairs is the beer house where you can also eat food, good time and great food!! The service is quick and friendly, the bavarian wings are amazing and a must try!"}
{"text":"Came in on a saturday night. Mediocre service- the waitress had so many tables it was ridiculous. I asked for a cherry whiskey paralyzer and they told me they didnt carry that liquor. Anyways, ordered the big pretzel, wings, poutine, and potato skins. poutine was awful- and the manger took it off our tab. very well handled.  potato skins were a very small portion, but very good and hot.  the big pretzel was huge and warm and amazing. the sides of butter and mustard spread were very small and the waitress didnt tell us which one was which (there is about 4 differemt coloured pastes on the plate).  the ambiance is very hipster, lots of young rambunctious teens, loud and busy."}
{"text":"Great german restaurant!  I was warned ahead of time that it was a \"heavy\" meal so I opted for appetizers instead of a meal.  I order the poutine, which is made from duck fat fries, cheese, gravy and peas.  It was delicious!    And it was a large order!  I didn't get through the whole thing :)  I also ordered a brat...because when in Rome...   :)  I had the brat on a bun, the thuringer brat. I was getting full at this point so opted to eat the brat off the bun :)  With the saurkraut.  I also enjoyed a nice German beer.  Edinger Weissbrau.  So good!  The place itself is pretty cool.  Large upstairs that seem to be more for meals and snacks.  Very large downstairs with large tables for drinking and celebrating.  They have a really amazing collection showing downstairs of steins as well.  Staff was friendly.  Service was decent (not fast but not slow either).  Pricing was average for a Canadian restaurant.  I would return and most likely will while I am here for work!"}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting... It was better!  I can only review the upstairs portion as that is where we sat, up at the bar after dinner elsewhere. I loved the look and airy feel of the place. I was expecting something more beer-hallish and I think downstairs is where you would find that but upstairs was classy, great bar-service and everyone was eating what looked to be delicious food. No rowdiness up here. The huge trees set up in the dining area between the tables made the space, lit up and so cool! There was a patio where people were hanging out and I was told there were lamp heaters out there and a firepit. The restaurant was clean and unique looking. Lots of warm wood and a cool bar set-up with tons of beer lines built into one great big steel tube. I do not like beer, my husband does. But all that changed when I tried this grapefruit beer that tasted like a sweet wine! Thanks to this fab bartender I can now have a glass of beer with hubby! A live German-style band showed up to play downstairs at around 9.(Fri night) They were good! I want to come back and try the eats. German food has not been too high on my list of faves but from what I have seen on the plates tonight, I wish we had come hungry! Will be back! (I have to try this pretzel everyone is talking about!)"}
{"text":"Hmm...German? I don't think so people. For anyone who's spent time in Germany, has German ancestry, and memories of their grandmother's cooking, this place is about as uniquely German as The Ginger Beef House is Chinese. But even that's an overstatement. Just another example of bland Canadian-ised wannabe ethnic cuisine.  For example...where's the kassler, currywurst, jagerschnitzel, kartoffelsalat, rouladen, wiersingeintopf, sauerbraten & knodel? Or classic German deserts such as mohnkuchen, donauwelle, and pflaumenkuchen??   Instead Wurst offers us average/standard fare pub food - chili cheese nachos, poutine, sliders, wings, NY Steak, burgers, tuna tacos (wtf?), potato skins, and fudge brownies. What are they afraid of? Why not have a menu that showcases a variety of German cuisine?...instead of the small handful of basic German cliche items they do offer (bratwurst, sauerkraut, & schnitzel), which are mediocre at best.  I get a kick out of some of these 4 and 5 star reviews, based on the fact people are impressed with the nachos and duck poutine, Lol.  I remember years ago, in approximately the same location Calgarian's had Franzl's Gasthaus...now that was a true German dining experience. The folks at Wurst should think about that.  Might as well go to Earl's up the street, as the menu is quite similar.  Honestly these guys should seriously think about changing their name/logo and theme, as in my opinion this place is a bit of a joke. However, the staff and servers were very friendly, hence my 2 star rating."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5 Service: 3.5/5 Ambiance: 3.5/5 Overall experience: 3.5/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  When I first walked into Wurst I was struck by the upstairs restaurant's beautiful decor. There was a huge tree growing out of the floor and sparkling lights that made me feel like I stepped into an enchanted forest (very romantic). Immediately downstairs is Wurst's Bavarian Beer Hall - a completely different atmosphere and a gong show on the weekends. Either go really early on a Saturday or make reservations if you want to guarantee a seat.   The Beer Hall area was dark, yet intimate and lively with neat German trinkets on the walls. As the night progressed, the hall became more crowded and loud from drunks and the blaring German band tooting out festive tunes. You have to yell at the people in your table to talk to them. The waitresses are dressed up in traditional German bar-maid attire and for the most part are really friendly and attentive. You definately get a true German Beer Hall experience!  Every Saturday they even have a contest to see who could hold a Stein of water in front of them the longest. Winners get a $25 gift certificate.    The biggest turnoff was that the food and drink prices were inflated - my bill came out to be around $40 for only two beers and an appetizer!   They have a decent amount of German bottles and drafts including pilsners, wheaty Weizens, dark Dunkels, and the popular fruity Stiegl Radler (grapefruit). 1/2 a liter will cost at least $7.25-$20; 1L is from $14.50-$20; and a 2L Boot is from $38-$40. Granted, it's fun to drink from a boot shaped mug but if you want to save money opt for two 1L drinks.   Their food menu felt more like \"German inspired\" and not purely focused on the cuisine. Appetizers are from $15; cured meats ($9-$13); cheese; seafood (shellfish); rotisserie and grill items like hamburgers ($16), brats ($26), and schnitzel for two ($35); and from their carvery you can get 1/2 or 1 lb of chicken, prime rib, pork loin, brisket, ham, or sausage ($14-$25). Each carvery order comes out on a wooden cutting board with meat on one side, two slices of your choice of bread and sauce. You can either eat it separately or as a sandwich. My friends seemed to enjoy it and were stuffed by the end.   For a real treat, you can order 'Franzl's Mixed Grill' which is a big platter of house made bratwurst, knackwurst (light colored sausage), prime rib, schweinshaxen (roasted ham hock/knuckle), Kassler pork loin (tough to eat and fatty), German fried potatoes, and bread dumplings on top of a pile of spatzle (soggy, bland egg noodle-like thing) and warm sauerkraut. They charge you $39/person for two people ($78 platter), but it can feed 4-5 people. It's a great opportunity to try a variety of German meats but the overall consensus was that it was really salty and pricey.  Other items I tried were the \"famous\" 'Bavarian Wings' which was only OK. For $15, you get three large wings stuffed with sausage, then breaded with pretzels and hot sauce. I was expecting actual chicken meat as part of the wing, but it was more like 98% sausage meat encased by \"chicken skin\" instead of the usual sausage casing. The wings were not crispy and the hot sauce only added a bit of heat. The order will definitely fill up one person, but is good to share amongst 3 people. For $15, this appetizer wasn't worth it.   I also got the 'Schnitzel Tacos' ($16) which were four, two-bite hard shell tacos with a tiny portion of crispy schnitzel. The tacos were bland unless you dipped it in the accompanying Valentina (mildly hot) sauce. The dish was really hard to eat since it fell apart after the first bite. I would NOT recommend this dish.   What I do recommend is the 'Pretzel Bucket' ($7) - about four warm soft, chewy pretzels with a crisp exterior. The four accompanying mustards were a perfect compliment. The 'Duck Fat Fries' ($8) were also surprisingly good and the portion was enough for one person.  If you already haven't been here, the Beer Hall is a great place to visit with a group of friends. You will definitely have a good time bonding with other drunks! The only drag is that the food and drinks are expensive."}
{"text":"I was there for a late lunch on a Saturday and actually found the service to be spectacular. However, the place was nearly empty so this could be why. The house brew is excellent, particularly the 1516 and Kolsch.  A few issues I had. Firstly, it is very expensive. Secondly, the chicken schnitzel was far from authentic. It was thick and juicy, and while that is normally a good thing, it doesn't translate well to schnitzel. Appreciated the minimalist salad dressing but the side portion could have been larger.  All that said, the beer quality is surprisingly good with excellent presentation and style. There was clearly some careful decision making in how to approach the beer drinking experience in this venue. If you can afford it, I highly recommend checking it out. I would venture below to the beer hall, however, and skip the upstairs and the food."}
{"text":"So this review is of the top level only, I'm not even sure if there is a difference. It was the Sunday of St. Patty's day weekend and we were doing a mini pub crawl thing.   Our friend even knew the bartender and we will were ignored. We came in, there was maybe a handful of tables with patrons and we sat up at the bar, as that was our mission, quick drink and onto the next place. We were there for a solid 15-20 minutes before we were even acknowledged, after that we decided this was unacceptable, had a quick shot and left."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place ... for Sunday Brunch - with my wife and 17 year old son. I love the location ... and the look of the place. They spent YEARS (?!!) rennovating the building just prior to the flood in June 2013 ... then spent another 6 months renovating and re-opened in December. I was curious!  We parked in Safeway Parking lot ... upon entering we were quickly seated. I got my coffee and was happy.  Unfortunately my wife got her coffee - but had to wait ... and wait ... and wait for the milk and sugar.  (... it seemed like things were going down hill. Sometimes you just get a feeling. If we had cash in our pocket ... we probably would have left.)  We all orderd some variation of Eggs Benedict.  ... well - I have this habit of eating EVERYTHING on my plate ... and over eat all the freaking time.  It becomes very obvious how much I eat ... compared to my active and athletic son. This is kind of becoming upsetting to me ... so while this has nothing to do with Wurst ... it is probably coming out in this review!  Sorry Wurst.  He only ate half his plate, claiming ... \"I feel like they cooked the eggs in dirty water - and those were yesterdays fries.\"  ... I kind of felt the same ... but that didn't stop me from eating EVERYTHING.  I pretty much felt like crap the rest of the day.  While I love the idea of this place ... Sunny South Patio, beer, great location ... I will not rush back. I need to choose healthier restaurants ... which focus on quality and smaller portions ... because I just have this terrible habit of over eating no matter how bad the food is.  Damn - why do I do that?  I considered a 2 star rating ... but that is just mean.  3 Stars ... cause the location is amazing ... and despite poor service - our waitress was terribly cute."}
{"text":"Last night I attended the opening of Wurst. Opened by the same people who brought us Mercato, this time they were venturing into German (or more specifically, Bavarian food) basically all the items you might find at Oktoberfest.   I never knew it, but apparently all my favourite foods are Bavarian; Venison Corn Dogs, Lamb Sliders, Stuffed Chicken Wings, along with a spread of smoked meats and Cheese fondue were among the delectable items. My favourite had to be the homemade pretzels and the Bison Profiteroles.   As this is a Bavarian Food and Beer House, the beer selection is extensive; 20 on tap, and plenty more in bottles. My favourite was Stiegl... in the 1 Litre Mug.   Something interesting at Wurst is their 'Stein Wall'; for 250$ per year, you can keep your own beer stein in a private locker that only you and the manager have keys to. Part of the fee goes to charity, and although as of last night they are all sold out, they are currently holding a contest to win one (the last day for entries is June 19th).   All in all, I approve: great food, great beer, a beautiful 2 floor space, and a great location should make Wurst the best new thing in Mission."}
{"text":"Holy overpriced German food batman! $26 for a bratwurst entree (and that's the cheapest entree they have)is crazy, German food is supposed to be large quantities for cheap with way too much beer..a 200ml glass cost $4, no, just no. I've been to Germany often (born & raised in The Netherlands) and this kind of pretentiousness is shameful and doesnt represent the country and its generosity with food and drink at all. The service was meh, however the taste of the food was good and the decor nice and that's the only reason it got 2 stars."}
{"text":"The Germans have Das Auto and they also have Das Boot. 2L of beer drinking.  There's the more civil main dining floor and then there's party central downstairs. Starting at the main floor, we started with some food. Ever hear of stuffed chicken wings, well meet mutant massive German sausage chicken wings. Suck it KFC. Pretzels were pretty good.  Now onto the important part, Das Boot. 2L = 6 beer. I thought no problem! Well when Das Boot arrives, you'll say WTF did I just get myself into. FYI it's $60 if you break Das Boot so control your drunkness.  One slight complaint was the manager's attitude. So supposedly according to Alberta liquor law, a patron can't have Das Boot and shots at the same time. Okay.. So being a slight jerk I challenged this since we ordered shots at the get go with no issues. Does the law actually refer to Das Boot? I'd be surprised. The manager chick  hated me. Oh well.  Later on we took Das Boots downstairs where they were a plenty among cowboys/cowgirls dancing on the tables and causing a good 'ol ruckus. Everyone I talked to was cool. No BS pretentiousness here.   I finished maybe 2/3 of Das Boot. The Germans won."}
{"text":"The first time I checked this place out was for a brunch catch up with Elle. The original plan was to come at 11am, but who \"plans\" on lazy Sundays? Clowns who hate clowns. (*shrugs* I dunno). So after constant back-forth texting of \"almost theres\" I was the first to come. On Brunchdays their Mimosas on special. Whats a Mimosa? I don't remember but its a great excuse to drink on a Sunday.  We had the duck confit benedict and pan scrambler with house sausage. The duck confit was delicious and the scrambler was a heavy dish that could knock out any form of hangover. I wanted to try their beer but when I looked at the menu, I just shook my head at how ridiculous beer prices are, sorry Wurst, you should be happy I'm giving you four stars on your brunch experience alone.  Their prices are a bit high compared to other popular diner joints in the city but the menu is interests me enough to visit this place again.  The only thing about this place is the weird decor. I gotta be honest I felt like I was in Rivendell (Re: Lord of the Rings) rather than a beergarden. It's the indoor trees with the weird trinkets."}
{"text":"We only went for drinks late one evening and I was impressed that they had a gluten free beer on the menu (which can be hard to find) and they had magnars cider which is one if my favourites! I loved the ambience of the place and will Def be coming back for oktober fest!"}
{"text":"The upstairs is very airy and pretty. The downstairs is pretty dark, loud and fun. The service was good considering how chaotic the place was that night. The manager was on top of everything - answering questions/concerns and offering suggestions. I enjoyed the beer and the large dishes of meats mixed with potatoes. I found the meat a little bland and salty, but there were a ton of mustard/condiments. Everyone I was with enjoyed the meats, so perhaps it was just me. However, the appetizers were not good value or very tasty. We all agreed that next time we would skip the appies and go straight for the entrees. Love the complimentary pretzels!"}
{"text":"Really cool venue and good selection of beer. The size of it almost works against it, since it was half empty. The food was possibly overpriced, but still good. Unfortunately, the crowd was not diverse and mostly male dominated. It gave off a stale energy. When I'm in a beer hall, I either expect a high degree of energy or a constant vibe of activity which is complemented nicely with music. Wurst seems to have some of the fixings, just hasn't packaged it altogether properly. Will visit on another night to see what's up."}
{"text":"I was at Wurst with a group of friends during the weekday. We decided to share a bunch of different things off of the menu. The food was at times tasty (flat-bread was okay, wings were decent) and at other times a little bland (nachos). We also had fries and wings and sausages which were okay. I found it to be a little too expensive for what you get although the atmosphere was enjoyable.  The service isn't exceptional by any means, the only time the server was pleasant was when we were paying our bills. Most of the time prior to that it was difficult if not impossible to get a smile.  Overall, I wouldn't consider this place too often when thinking of a place to go for drinks and food."}
{"text":"It was more on the slow side but the prezel was amazing! Loved the atmosphere and the waitress was nice :3 going to try the fondue next time!"}
{"text":"This is a one star petition for @WURSTCalgary to add Curry Wurst to the menu.   My actual rating for Wurst is easily a 5 (it's amazing), but when I heard the name and the concept I was REALLY, REALLY hoping that they had one of my favourite German dishes. Especially since I can't find it anywhere else in Calgary..   If you don't know, curry wurst is a very simple quick-food type of dish that is typically only sold in Berlin. But it's the curry sauce on top that is just absolutely amazing.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currywurst  I had it while I was on vacation there last year and it blew my effin mind.  If someone at Wurst actually sees this and adds it to the menu, just send me an @reply and I will tell all of my friends. Seriously, I am that into this dish. My Twitter handle is: @alfgoetz  Once again (for the record), I love Wurst and I've been there a TON. If you go sit in the beer hall downstairs and order the Bavarian Wings. You only get three, but that is all you need. Trust me."}
{"text":"I love their selection of beers, and that the servers are able to give great recommendations.   Their section in the back of the restaurant is perfect for a large group - I really enjoy dining here.  Their food has improved a lot from my first visit - it is still tough to find healthy selections.  The charcuterie boards and prawn entree are both delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm giving Wurst a four star rating for 2 reasons.  The Wienerschnitzel was truly outstanding.  It was very tender and perfectly seasoned.  The service was also exceptional.  My only complaint is that I wish their German beer list went deeper.  Weihenstephaner on tap would be a real treat in this city."}
{"text":"Favourite bar in Calgary in regards to food. I love this place because it just has such an awesome atmosphere. Downstairs is a very German style benches and awesome for a big group, upstairs is more classy and good for dates or small children. Good for everybody, but it's is quite expensive."}
{"text":"Excellent food, cool atmosphere, worst service, and aggressive bouncers.   I came with a large group of friends on New Year's Eve this year and I had offered to be DD, when I arrived and found a spot to sit with my friends, I tried to order the poutine, when we started our order I explained I was dd and asked for a water our waitress sighed and walked away without taking our food order which we had expressed we wanted. When we finally got our poutine though it was really incredible, really crisp and the green peas were a neat twist.   As the night progressed I watched the bouncers interact with the patrons and was really upset at how the treated the customers. My friends revived verbal threats of violence from several different bouncers. At about 10pm everyone around us started to dance on the large communal tables so we got up to participate but had a bouncer come up and pull one of my friends down and try and kick him out. when my friend asked what he had done the bouncer told him he had choice to leave on his own or he would take him outside himself and beat him up.   All the bouncers used crude and aggressive language, and were quick to there tempers and overall unprofessional.   Our night ended by my one female friend being kicked out and left outside without her jacket, and none of her friends in the -15 degree weather. I have a hard time understanding how you can treat another human being how a lot of my friends were treated by the bouncers that night.   I gave wurst 2 stars because I imagine if you were to come for lunch or an early dinner and just eat and leave it could be a cool place and the food is really good, but for events or if your looking to make a night of it I would not recommend."}
{"text":"We had a great visit to Wurst last night. I had the Wiener schnitzel, and my wife had the SchweinShaxen, which is basically a ham hock. As usual, the food tasted great, and we had a nice 1/2 price bottle of wine with the meal. (tiefenbrunner pinot grigio). Our server, a bubbly red-head was very nice to us, and the music, though not entirely to my tastes, was still well done.  The only reason for not giving the fifth star was that the portions are insanely large, and you can't do half orders. They're also plated in a way that the plate is super crowded, and it's a bit of a pain eating the food in a semi-civilized way. For example, the ham hock came in a cast iron casserole thing that left almost no room to move the food around to get your knife on it. My wiener schnitzel was two large pieces, stacked on each other, stacked on the fries. The salad was in a little cup, but was stacked so high, sticking a fork in it sent salad all over."}
{"text":"I have to say...every time I go to this place, I like it less and less!! It amazes me how crappy the service is in the pub. And the main reason for the crappy service is that it is over packed so the poor servers have to fight crowds to delivery drinks and food. I literally waited over 30 mins to get acknowledged by the server of our section, who then seemed appauled that I was ordering a soda and some food. Which continued to take another 30-45 minutes to arrive. Food came before the soda (go figure), and I then asked for my bill because who knew when I'd see her again.  I don't get why a place woudl sacrifice service to have more people in the buildling. I'm sure it's a fire hazard how they jam everyone in the basement so you can barely walk around. I doubt I'll be rushing back here any time soon.  As for the restaurant upstairs, I'm still madely in love with it. So delicious, so awesome, so everything perfect!!"}
{"text":"*Insert joke using a \"worst\" pun here.*  Everyone do the poor wait staff a favor and stop making those puns. You don't think they've heard all of them? I wince when I see one of the poor staff fake a chuckle at the terrible wanna-be-comedy expressions produced by the patrons who have one too many boots for their own good.  Anyways, getting to the review, do you like beer? Do you like fresh oysters? Do you like a friendly atmosphere? Well you're in the right place. Wurst is a great place to go for dinner (upstairs) or just for drinks (downstairs). The food is generally really good with the exception of the schnitzel. I'm confused why a German inspired bar would have a poor quality German dish but unfortunately that is the case. The other German dishes, on the other hand, are really great quality. They even serve a pretty good steak considering they're in a city with a lot of competition in that area.  Also I hear many rumors and stories of the crazy party nights, but unfortunately I haven't been able to attend yet. I look forward to this experience in the future and will update my review after that time.  Great beer and great food, that's what everyone is looking for, right?"}
{"text":"Our favourite spot to hoist a stein and enjoy some great German food. Upstairs is a perfect spot to enjoy brunch on the weekend. The beer hall downstairs is always a good time although it can get a bit rowdy. Our go-to place to watch Bayern Munich and Die Mannschaft play!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here recently. I had a beet salad and a nice ros√® on the patio. It was a beautiful day. The menu was definitely on the rich meaty sausage side. LOTS of beers to choose from. Service was decent and parking is TERRIBLE!! Had to pay $10 in the lot to have lunch here. At least Earls down the road reimburses you for parking."}
{"text":"All time favourite beer hall ! It's my favourite bar in all of Calgary !! Love the feel in there! The environment is always fun every time I went ! Highly recommend  every one is always there to just have a good time and have fun! I haven't eaten here yet, but I do plan on trying it some time when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Wurst has a really fun atmosphere, whether outside, upstairs or downstairs. There is also quality food and beer, and great service. My only complaint is that it's basically a German-themed gastropub, but your bill will make you feel like you just ate at Rouge, except you didn't."}
{"text":"My first experience with this restaurant was not a good one. When attempting to make a reservation online I was sad to see nothing for more than 30 days. We went anyways and decided to try and get in downstairs in the bar. We were there more than an hour and not one staff member so much as said welcome to me. They don't take down names and give tables to people as they come available in the order people came in. Most people play dirty to get tables and in a restaurant that costs as much as Wurst, a customer should never have to fight for a table.  The place was so packed there was barely standing room and they had groups of two sitting at tables built for four to eight. One table of two people sat there for over an hour and just had some beer. If they had sat at the bar then at least four people who were there for dinner could have sat down. As well as a huge booth built for at least six with a couple. It's just not intelligent seating at all by the restaurant. The large wooden tables in the middle of the bar which were built to seat I would think at least 15 were mostly half full with reserved signs on them. They stayed that way the entire time we were there. It's not smart seating either because clearly it wasted 20 or more seats for people waiting. Most restaurants I've been too give up your table or move you if you can't fill the seats you reserved. Had they allowed people to sit and eat at those empty seats they'd have a huge uptake in income.  I had a ice tea because I can't drink but the others ordered the large steins of beer. It was sixty dollars for three beers and my group was a little unimpressed with the price. They wouldn't have cared if we were sitting and eating at the time.   So we stood around for an hour trying to find a table for dinner and got nothing but attitude and a clear sense of poor judgement and planning. I was excited to try their food but in the end my experience couldn't be Wurst."}
{"text":"Wow. Walking in, I was really impressed with the lovely decor, and intimate ambiance. Great first impression.  We asked to hostess for a spot on the patio. She non-challantly walked outside, through the patio, came back the long way around to tell us it would be a 20-minute wait. It literally took her 5 minutes just to do that.  Fine. Seat us inside then...  We sat at a tiny two-top, sort of in the middle of nowhere. Our server didn't smile at us once. She was efficient, but if I am paying good money to dine out, I don't think a smile is too much to ask for.   We had the cheese fondu. It was lovely, but very filling. Luckily my bf and I decided to share a j√§ger schnitzel. The veggies and spaetzle were delicious. The schnitzel was under seasoned, and wouldn't you know it, this is one of those pretentious places without salt and pepper on the table. We didn't bother asking for it.   So overall, pretentious, overpriced, and just plain ol' 'stuck-up'! I hear great things about the bar downstairs, so don't waste your time in the restaurant, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Have been at WURST on few occasions( one was a private event); loud and fun atmosphere, great selection on beer but the food is just average; service has always been good and consistent."}
{"text":"Awesome German theme restaurant and pub. Great selections of food AND German beer! Food are well prepared and presented with quality, and you can tell from a small garnish pickle to a gigantic signature meat plate.  You would never miss out a beer from their beer selections to pair up with your dish."}
{"text":"I come here for brunch almost every weekend. I always order the French toast which is amazing. The service is usually pretty speedy and its actually decent coffee. Kids are welcome which is awesome.   In the evenings it gets pretty rowdy downstairs with oompah bands and stein holding contests. I only managed about two minutes before I set my stein down.  Next time!"}
{"text":"Attended this location for the first time today in honor of a colleagues birthday. The service was swift, very informative on the menu and kept a keen eye to refill drinks.  I partook in the chicken club sandwich - a good feed if you are hungry - food arrived hot and was flavorful. The beer selection was decent and most at the table found something they liked. One person even tackled 'the boot' - a 2 litre beast and not for the shy!  Given this lunch and the level of service I would recommend and visit again."}
{"text":"Went to wurst to watch game of thrones and it was fun. Realized however dinner for two and a round of beers would have paid for my monthly subscription to HBO so take that with a grain of salt before making the reservation. Everyone was very polite while watching the show  The Dom burger was just bland. Not worth  - would have had a better burger at fast food - extreme warning to stay away from wasting your money. Fries were a redeeming feature.  The chicken brie sandwich however was extremely tasty. They pulled that one off well so I would highly recommend that one."}
{"text":"Love this place! Went there tonight for Oktoberfest, the guys in lederhosen playing music and having us stand on our table made the night ! Great atmosphere upstairs too! We came for drinks, but I'll definitely be back for the food soon!"}
{"text":"Not a terrible place to go with a group of friends. Food was alright, nothing to write home about. Sauerkraut was subpar, the pork was alright, and the pretzel was a pretzel. The best part of the night was the band that came around and sang and played for us, encouraging us to get on the table and let loose."}
{"text":"Always a great meal! Loved the traditional German dance troop and band down in the beer hall. I think that's in Friday nights. You can buy a stein and they will store it for you in a stein locker for when you come back."}
{"text":"I love a good German bier hall as much as the next girl, but this place really brings out my best and my wurst.   I've averaged the 5 and the 1 for a three star. I'd go back because it is so pretty, but I don't know that I would organize an event there in the near future either.  My first visit was during Oktoberfest, a bit of a gong show in the giant basement. Having just gotten back from Germany, it was fun to see the big picnic tables out and about, and the German band in full swing. The atmosphere was great, tons of people but still space to sit, our server was on it and the food that I stole off my friends plate was quite tasty! Overall, a 5 star experience! I love the decor - earthy, European, and just plain stylin'.  I was a little bit disappointed by the beer selection, but I grabbed the sampler, sat back and enjoyed the double headed bird decor. When we finally left a little bit early, I was surprised to see a big line coming out the door.  My second experience emphasized a lot of my bar pet peeves. First of all, I was late meeting some friends, and thought if I got there by 9, I'd beat the line. Not so. And not only that, the bouncer was not interested in letting me join my friends at their table and was downright rude. So, after a little friend- guilt tripping and a too long wait with them, we made it in for some increasingly bad service.  The drinks are, let's face it, overpriced for what they are, which I can live with when everything else comes together. But my second visit was a one star. Either Wurst is a little bi-polar, is getting a little too popular and its going to their heads, or the best time to come down is during lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for burgerfest and on a playoff night. Food was fantastic and service was even better. Our server made sure to constantly check up on us, even after we were done eating. She refilled our waters before we would even get the chance to ask her. Oh and the duck confit poutine is gold. It's a must order!"}
{"text":"Was in for drinks the other day, and this is one serious happening joint!  Maybe it's the private party function downstairs, but love the ambience, vibe, and the walkway looking down to the basement.   It's a place to be seen.  Kinda heritage-like decor without the bricks but more wood beams.  Friendly service.  prices to be expected at a Yaletown-ish area, back home.  Like their brunch hours, even til 3pm on weekends."}
{"text":"Came here as per a recommendation from a friend and after reading great reviews online.  Cool atmosphere, service was great, food was better  Best of all - I had a small problem with my order and the manager compt my whole meal and brought the whole table shots!"}
{"text":"I'm an avid reader of City Palate and as such I heard about Wurst quite some time ago.  Being that I have German in my blood and I grew up eating German fare (yes travelled to Germany to visit and stay with relatives as well) it appealed to me, not to mention I enjoy beer (when I'm not drinking wine).  And so I have been trying to find a time to bring the family to Wurst but so many factors have stopped us from being able to get there to try it out.  During this process I have been in communication with Geoff at Wurst and I have to say above all his customer service has exceeded any I have ever had.  Kudos to Geoff!  And so finally I was able to meet a girlfriend there for lunch/brunch on a Saturday (we had made reservations).  As soon as I walked into the restaurant I was very impressed with pretty much everything.  My gf and I both ordered Benny's for brunch.  I had the smoked salmon & double brie eggs benny and my gf had the duck confit eggs benny.  Both meals were outstanding, the customer service impressive and quality of food for the price just fabulous.    I also have to mention I enjoyed being able to order samplers of the beer to see if I wanted to indulge more in a particular beer or try a new one. Speaks to me!  I can not think of a con on my first visit to Wurst.  What I would recommend as I did not see it on the menu is adding Schnapps as an option.  The homemade schnapps in Germany is mind boggling good & potent(my family's recipe).   I will return to this restaurant and I will recommend it.  Prost!"}
{"text":"Wurst has changed for the worse! Wurst used to be a staple for a good weekend brunch in a casual atmosphere. Today's experience has proven otherwise. My meal - duck eggs benny  was good 8/10 my wife's Mexican omelet was nothing more than diced tomatoes and cheese (jalape√±os on the side) 4.5/10. The meals alone wouldn't warrant 1 star it's what happened after brunch that set me off...  As we were leaving I used the washroom, turned the tap on to wash my hands to notice there was no soap; not the end of the world until.... I noticed whoever cleaned last failed to wipe down the sink spout which was covered in VOMIT!  Irritated I asked to speak to the manager, her response was \"oh, it must have just happened\" clearly this wasn't the case as it's 10:30am in the morning, we were the very first people in the restaurant and a good portion of the mess was cleaned up. The mess was clearly from the night prior.  My review on Wurst is it used to be great however at some point they stopped caring and putting in little effort.   Too bad!!!  Mark"}
{"text":"I have always had a good time at this place. Go there for beer and some standard German bar food, but don't expect much from the food menu. It can get very crowded on the weekends, but almost always happening and loud!"}
{"text":"1st time here with my wife (2nd time for her) Nice looking place with good service, good beer but tasteless food. We ordered the stuffed chicken wing, grilled cheeze sliders. duck frites, beef dumplings. The stuffed chicken wing was larger than I imagined it would be. The coating seemed to go a little heavy on what I think was chipotle but it over powered the stuffing on the inside. The cheeze grilled sliders looked good but the cheeze had no taste. The duck fries were good as well as the aioli on the side. The beef dumpling were just tasteless all around. I can see now why 3 of the dishes came with a dip sauce of some sort 'cause THATS where they put the flavor. We didnt hate our meal but its certainly not worth driving at least 1/2 hour to get there."}
{"text":"This place is the Wurst!  Actually, it's hard to find something other than it's name that isn't just Uber-Awesome!    Wurst is on it's second iteration, after only a few short years in business, it was completely flooded out in June 2013's epic disaster.  It was the Wurst for this business (sorry for the pun)!  These guys have reopened, cleaner and better than ever!  I think they might have even lowered their prices!  This restaurant is the closest to a true Bavarian Bierhaus to any I have seen in Canada thus far.  It's set up 'family-style' with long bench laden tables that seat somewhere between 14-50, depending on how busy the night gets any how close you want to get to your neighbour.    Weekends here are what legends are made of: German Oompa bands, 2 litre Beer boots and 1litre steins that sure make an epic CLANK when you smash two together and yell PROST!  The menu is typically German, taking influences from all across the German regions, even offering a sausage platter that I believe is from 3 different cultural districts!  The food is great and they never skimp out on the multiple mustards and the huge portions of sauerkraut with the sausage plates!  If you went here before the floods, go back!  This places needs a really big year and any local support it can handle!  A unique bar like this needs to stay in Calgary for the long run, so everyone go in once and buy a stein of your favourite German Bier!  Oh, and if you are truly hardcore, you can rent a locker where you can store your cheesy (but yes, cool) beer stein that the servers will fill upon your request!  Just a word to the wise on this one guys... Every female I have visited this pub with definitely stay away from gents that have their own mug.  It's a major fail-factor for meeting girls!"}
{"text":"I returned to Wurst for dinner with my lovely sisters last week. I was so excited because I've wanted to come back since the first time I was here and try something else on the menu. When we arrived, it was quite busy and although we did not have a reservation, we were seated right away. It was then that we waited almost 15 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us...and we could see servers walking around everywhere. I'm not going to lie, I was getting really annoyed. Not to mention the restaurant was super freezing inside, which made it pretty uncomfortable. Finally, a (very cute) young man appeared and took care of us for the rest of the evening. Crisis averted! We decided to share a bunch of appies. I had an order of oysters (of course) and I still find these to be some of the best in the city. I think a part of that has to do with the mignonette they serve, just lovely! We also had an order of the Ahi Tuna, the Buffalo Mozzarella & Watermelon, and the Cheese & Charcuterie Board. The first two appies were DEEELISH. Absolutely wonderful, I adored every bite. The cheese board was HUGE! Loved the selection but wasn't a fan of the charcuterie, and wished there were more crackers (rather than bread). We also sipped prosecco all evening, which was divine. The bill was not cheap, but I knew that going in so I was okay with it. I ended up having a wonderful conversation with our server after the meal and was really impressed. I did ask about the AC and it looked as if he went to ask about it, but I did not notice a change afterwards. However, a little brush up on the service, and this would be a solid 4-star review."}
{"text":"I feel like North America doesn't have enough German food. It's a shame really because German food is so, so good! Wurst is such a fun environment and has some great traditional German dishes. They have HUGE portions so you may want to split them! Wurst also has a fantastic selection of beer complete with a 2L boot if you are really enthusiastic! Drink it fast though or you will end up with warm beer!   This place gets so busy on the weekends, so come early or make a reservation. The main floor is more of a lounge area which would be great for dinner, and the down stairs is definitely where the party is at! I loved that there is German band marching around in lederhosen playing live music, it really adds a nice touch.  The food is excellent, lots of meat and bread, but oh so excellent! The schnitzel was to die for and the pretzel with different mustard dipping sauces was also one of my favorites!   Wurst is definitely one of my favorite places to come on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get much Wurst than this. There's a new restaurant and German bier hall where Wildwood used to be. And man oh man, you're in for a treat. My very first time here was for the opening. Yes, it was an evening made to impress. I saved my first review for a return visit to see an ordinary evening out would see the same levels of quality and service.  I stopped in to meet a couple of friends for some birthday drinks (not mine) on Saturday night. I wasn't sure if they'd be upstairs or downstairs, so I did a quick round through the restaurant first. When I was here for the opening there was plenty of standing room. Now that standing room has been replaced with more seating. Nice for those seated so more of them can be accommodated, not so easy to do a walk around through. With all tables full, it was a little cramped getting through there, especially when a server was in the midst of taking somebody's order and there's no way around her. The cool part about the restaurant are the live trees in the middle of it. Yep! Real, live trees.   Downstairs was-thankfully-far less busy than the opening. Don't get the wrong idea, it was still pretty full of people, you just didn't have to make friends with every person you met as you tried to politely brush past them. The long, wooden tables provided ample seating and encouraged patrons to sit where there's room. Only half a table open? No problem! Take a seat, there's plenty of room here. Besides the open kitchen, I'm most excited to see what bier steins start showing up in the lockers by the stairs. You can rent one of your very own you know.  My friends had been here awhile and I had just missed our server coming around for our drink order. So I headed on upto the bar. It was maybe a 10 minute wait in total to get my drink. As I waited, I watched the staff behind the bar. Moving and maneuvering around one another, they were constantly on the go but able to move out of each others way where needed. As one bartender was pouring a beer, she looked up and asked me what I wanted. Multi-tasking with the orders. Efficient. I like it. I told her I wanted something that was a light ale with citrus. She suggested a grapefruit beer. I liked it so much I had another later in the night.  All in all, a delightful evening. Wurst was spot on. I can't wait to go back for some of the lamb and goat cheese crepes I tried at the opening."}
{"text":"I visit many German restaurants throughout North America when I'm on business. I found this one to be extremely good. There was plenty of clientele, and choices of draft beer. My schnitzel was cooked well and they were nice vegetables on the side. The staff was very friendly, in the food was a good value for the money."}
{"text":"Was downstairs in beerhall.  Loud, lively, fun atmosphere. Poutine was yummy. Had great items listed on menu. Had brass playing old men band that go by each table & if it's your bday they'll help you celebrate!"}
{"text":"Wow, Wurst has really changed!!! Wasn't this place fine dining restaurant once upon a time?  I love the new atmosphere! I mean, the location is on 4th street. This is a beautifully trendy part of Calgary and I think Wurst did a good job by opening their doors to a better variety of people. They've started catering to the young up-and-comers and it's made a world of difference. I think the business of this place really speaks for itself!  I was here for a friends birthday party and it consequently was also Oktoberfest! So it was super busy! You literally walk into the basement and its like this big German party! The staff were friendly and even with the amount of people in there the food came quickly. I love that you're able to just turn around and talk to people. Everyone is there to have a good time and meeting others is really easy. The staff do a good job of including everyone in competitions, songs, and light-hearted games. I really enjoyed this because it was an icebreaker for everyone in the room.   For food I had the Grilled Chicken Sandwich. It was really good! A few of my friends had poutine, and it wasn't really my cup of tea, but they seemed to enjoy it which is all that matters.   Overall I had a really great time here! I was definitely surprised by the change this place underwent, but it was a welcome surprise. This place is great and the crowd isn't too young so there aren't crazy drunk 18 year olds running around!"}
{"text":"The hostess said 30-45min wait, and we ended up waiting 90min for a table. The service was very slow once we were seated and our food was subpar. They took forever to bring our meals, cheques, and credit card machine. The worst part is we barely got any apologies for the long waits. Most restaurants would offer a free appetizer, or at least a sincere apology.  My husband ordered the schnitzel platter and it wasn't anything special - we both agreed we could have made it better at home. I ordered the schnitzel sandwich with truffle mayo and that was really good, and so was their baked cheese dip. Their pretzel was good, it comes with 3 mustards but you can tell they're not made in-house."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here with the lit up trees inside and the authentic German feel. I had the Weinersnitzle and it was fantastic, very similar to what you would find in Munich or Salzburg. They have a great selection of beers on tap and its always a happening place on the weekend. The only downside is, like a lot of trendy places in Calgary, it is a bit pricey for pub food."}
{"text":"I was moderately fearful of coming to Wurst after reading some pretty harsh reviews, but did my best to keep an open mind when finally making my way over for lunch today.  I share the same sentiments as Mia T.  I think it's beautiful and has a bright, down-to-earth, cozy atmosphere.  I loved it as soon as I walked in the door.  Even the restroom stalls are tastefully done.  I suspect that having lunch here is the way to go for a no-fail experience.  No waiting, excellent service and there's an upscale business crowd kickin' back for their break.  Again, loving it.    I was tempted to try the Lobster Cobb salad until I was told about the salmon salad special.  It was delicious.  Simple and flavorful.  With taxes and tip, I spent $21.  Pretty average for a restaurant of this nature.  My friend and I took a look at the beir hall before heading out.  It's novel and I'd also likely make an effort to head over mid afternoon one day in order to avoid the gong show of long waits and excessive noise.  The hostess was telling stories about how fun and crazy it gets here, but I'm too old to care about that.  If I want to enjoy the real thing, I'll go to Germany."}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks but the only thing good about WURST turned out to be the free wifi. I ordered the Blackberry Bauble and it was pretty weak (too much ice?), so for my next drink I asked the bartender to make me a cocktail using dark rum, blackberries, simple syrup and mint. It was disgusting and tasted like medicine (too much simple syrup) I let the bartender know, she attempted to argue with me, I pushed back. She offered me a beer instead but I'm not a beer drinker do I declined. Couldn't wait to get out of there. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Ach Mein Gott! Wurst refers itself as having an √úberkitchen.  They weren't kidding!  I walked in on a cold night last Wednesday to a fairly busy dining room, while the downstairs was reserved for a private event I opted to sit at the bar.  As I scanned the beer service I realized they had some really good ones. I went with the Weisse-Bier, can't go wrong with German food and a nice brew.  I seriously wanted to try everything from their menu because it reminded me of my trips to Germany.  When I saw that Schweinshaxen was on the menu I knew I had to order it as this is a very difficult dish to find in Canada.    The schweinhaxen I had in Germany and in the Czech Republic only differed because the skin was more roasted and crunchy than the version at Wurst.  This doesn't mean it wasn't another variation of the same recipe though. That being said, everything was amazing there was so much meat on the pork hock that I could not finish it.  The dumpling was flavorful as were the roast vegetables and red cabbage.  I also had a small bowl of German potato and leek soup.  Oh so good! Creamy and delicious - perfect for cold nights.  Would have loved to come back here but it will have to wait for my next visit to Calgary.  Overall: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Atmosphere: 5/5 Food: 5/5 Cleanliness: 5/5"}
{"text":"The beer hall is a great place to drink beer and have fun! It has somewhat of that highschool cafeteria feel and we can all relate to that. They've got a variety of beers and a few different sizes! A little bit of live entertainment further amplifies the rowdy-ness, but its not a bad thing. The upstairs is different, as it has more of the restaurant feel. The menu is also different for the upstairs and downstairs. food wise, the roast chicken and fries were awesome! I have to admit I wasn't the biggest fan of the food in the beer hall initially, but now I think you just have to know what to order. I've always been a fan of German food, but the last time I was there, it just wasn't doing it for me. I definitely do feel better about Wurst and recommend it for groups of friends that just wanna drink and party, without going to the club."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant with a fresh unique menu. I love the bavarian wings and the pork knuckle is one of the best dishes around. Not your every day generic calgary restaurant. Thank you for the originality wurst."}
{"text":"Sweet place to hang out and have a few, easy to mingle with strangers as most of the tables downstairs are community type tables. Fun atmosphere, good beer.   Good food, but extremely pricey, I had the rack of lamb and was disappointed with the portions when you compare it to places like Alloy or Charcut, portions are really small and price range is up there with these places.   Will go back to hang out and drink, but I will probably go else where to eat, unless if I'm absolutely craving for some German food."}
{"text":"Super cool ambience and music!!.. This is a great place for a Friday or Saturday night!!.. I had soooo much fun there!!.. Also the drinks were good... If you want to have a good time, this place is just perfect!!..."}
{"text":"The ambience of the upstairs is wonderful. The best way to describe it is pretty, I love the tree in the middle. The food however was nothing special. I found all the meat was dry and the side dish (veggies) were bland. My caesar was also nothing special and was not  how it was described on the menu. For the price of the food I found the quality did not match. The downstairs of Wurst is reminiscent of a German tavern. It can get busy so I suggest going early. The lighting is dim and on more than one occasion I hit my knee while trying to sit down at the long communal tables. It is a good place for large groups, and has a fun atmosphere. But other than that this place doesn't have much else to offer, not really sure why this place is so popular."}
{"text":"Food and drink are actually pretty good.  I guess the thing that bugs me is the attempt at german culture, and then the total commercialization / selling out of it.  $9.5 plus tax for 0.5L of beer?  Serving beer in a glass not from the actual brewer?  You'd go to jail for either of those things in Germany. Even at mega touristy oktoberfest in expensive munich, beer is easily 40% cheaper.  But I guess they have a monopoly on german places in calgary.  If I had the time, I'd open an authentic german place across the street where it didn't cost $50 to get drunk and we didn't try to make the place like Earls or Joeys.   That said beer and food are solid. It'd just be nice if someone actually spoke german there and it wasn't run like a marketing trap."}
{"text":"The German food at Wurst is as good as it gets when dining on German cuisine. The sausage  stuffed chicken wing is not to be missed as an appetizer and at $1 each the fresh shucked oysters are a bargain. The large sausage plate feeds two on sausages,kraut,spaetzel instead of potatoes. A side order of the cooked red carnage is a nice touch. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"Oddly enough, one might not think to come here for brunch, but they have one of the tastiest eggs benny that I have ever tried! Paired with a beer off of their good selections and you have a breakfast of champions! Definately a must try if you are a bennys fan. Great patio and wonderful staff every time Iv gone as well."}
{"text":"The brunch is awesome, I recommend all of it. The pretzel is also well executed, along with the bratwurst. There's also live music on Saturdays, and it's interactive too."}
{"text":"i was just talking with a friend of mine who is from germany.  wurst isn't entirely a german restaurant, however it does have some german dishes while covering standard bistro fare and also having regional dishes like bison short ribs, roasted trout, etc.    we started with a dozen oysters with an even east and west coast split, which were very good.  we were told they were freshly shipped in that day and it clearly showed.  i heard much about the pile of bratwurst, but i was in the mood for some prime rib, which is was very good.  the melted potatoes that came with was amazing.  my wife went for the rack of lamb, which was a little on the fatty side for both our taste, but was still good.  to be clear, i am one to appreciate and love fattier meat, but the serving we had was just a bit too much.    pricing is a bit on the more expensive side, but nothing too outrageous.    the service was amazing and were being helped by one of the bartenders who was both very friendly and fun to talk to. he was one of the main reasons for the 4 star review!"}
{"text":"Was at Wurst last night for some celebratory drinks after an exam and I liked it. We ordered a bottle of champagne and then the boys ordered some beers afterwards which they all liked having such a large selection to choose from.  The environment was really cool when we first got there. There was even a German style band with trombones and all. I noticed that as it got later (Saturday night, what did I expect), it got super super packed and unbelievably loud. Our nice conversations turned into screaming matches and my friend kept getting bumped by people. Like I said, what do I expect, it was a Saturday night and I guess I'm just not one to enjoy weekend pub crawls.  All in all, it was a nice set up, our bartender was sweet as pie and although I left with a raspy voice I had a good time."}
{"text":"Oktoberfest! Need I say more? Had a great time, good beer and yummy food. These guys do it right. I highly recommend. Das boot - 2 Ltrs of tasty brew in a boot shaped mug. Truly an ass kicker. Helps wash down the great sausages and kraut. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Giant pig, Giant servings, Giant beer, Giant boots - made for a giant?   I finally made it to Wurst last night for a friend's 29th bday (only 1 left for her) and I was so glad I didn't let laziness on a Friday night overtake the night out. Wurst was deadly. We arrived at 8:30pm and were taken to our seats quickly by a friendly hostess to join the others in the party. We had two tables at the back of what was a very cool restaurant. The giant tree, the lights, the awesome long bar, and nice tables - I liked the deco and I was surprised I did.  The waiter was decent, not withstanding that I got the beer wrong on the first order, then again on the second but alas, third time was a charm. He's lucky I like beer - any beer. The German beers was delicious (specifically the Ayinger Br√§u Weisse), and the large menu of beer and serving sizes was something I appreciate. Special note to the massive BOOT of beer. HA! Also surprising to me was the food. It was outstanding and very German. This was my first Schnitzel and I was so impressed. I had the Jaeger Schnitzel which came with Spatzle (I don't even know what all of this stuff was until it was in front of me - so it was a new and exciting venture.). The schnitzel was served in a gravy of sorts with mushrooms and onions and was unbelievably delicious - I could have eaten 5 lbs if it wasn't for the ridic amounts of beer inside my stomach. Others had the Schnitzel Chop which was a HUGGGEEEE hunk of something with a bone and a jar of bitter/sour jam. Again, I don't even know what this food was, but it was great. The portions were massive. Don't bother with a starter as the mains will feed two people each and you will want space for beer. My first German food experience left me excited to try more and come back. After supper we went downstairs which was a contrast to the restaurant. I felt catapulted into a German basement that looked like an old hut in the woods with picnic tables, wooden beams and a million 24 years olds drinking more beer than they could handle it seemed. It was very busy by midnight, everyone was pretty liquored, but it was also pretty fun. The music was top 40 and the song choices were my favs (with a random 1980's hit thrown in - loves it). Giant boots were abound and a silly amount of beer is served here on a nightly basis. (A boot of beer is 35$).  I really liked this place and look forward to a redo so I can try more beer and more German food. My waistline is not a fan of this idea however. It never is."}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday for fondue it was NOT good. The cheese fondue was heavy, thick and chunky...not supposed to happen?? The \"veggies\" they served with it felt like they had been defrosted from the freezer and were served very cold and in big chunks making it hard to eat and not pairing will with luke warm cheese.  We weren't happy with this at all.  Plus our server seemed scattered dealing with a 6 top behind us and paid very little attention to our table."}
{"text":"The good:   Downstairs is a party!  It's actually one of the best times I've had during my short stay in Calgary!  Beer selection is HUGE!  The bad:  Overpriced in my opinion.  But, it's similar to any German/Oktoberfest themed place I've ever gone to.  The food and the beer is WAAAY marked up!  $38/person for the platter (minimum 2 people) and the platter wasn't even that big!  But I did have a good time, they played the right songs and I've never ever seen so many people at one time get up on their bench to start dancing and  singing together to the following tunes: Don't stop by Journey and Friends in Low Places by Garth Brooks ever."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a few friends.   We ate upstairs, which has beautiful decor.  I love the enchanting trees with lights the monstrous paintings. It was almost empty, and thurs service was exceptional.  I ordered the chicken schnitzel and was less than impressed.  It isn't an authentic schnitzel, the meat wasn't pounded thin, and the breading was too bready.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their lunches though.   I did enjoy having mimosas which were on special.    We took a peek downstairs at the beer hall type area they had set up, and I can see how service might be an issue if it was packed.   Going for lunch is a good way to go if you want good service, as they are not overwhelmed."}
