{"text":"While \"New York Style\" Chinese carries a questionable connotation in  regard to food quality or style of cooking, the main meaning - in my mind at least - is that you do NOT eat in the restaurant, unless you are actually used to that \"authentic Chinatown\" ambiance. You order ahead and take out, or (preferably) order for delivery.
Having said that, I've ordered in from these guys about 10 times now. I have yet to have them get my order wrong, or take appreciably more time to deliver than promised.  And the food...
No, it won't win awards... and to be honest the quality hasn't always been consistent.  But when they're on, that's some of the best General Tso's chicken I've ever had.
If you like your Chinese unapologetically trashy - in the tradition of the best New York and San Francisco noodle dives - check this place out!"}
{"text":"Good vibes, good prices, good food!  We ordered won ton soup, hot n sour soup, egg rolls, happy family, beef with broccoli and fried wings. My husband loved his wings.  The only thing I wouldn't reorder is the beef broccoli, the meat is kinda chewy but every thing else was great!  The service was excellent and every one was super friendly which is a pleasant contrast to some of the places I've dealt with lately."}
{"text":"I have only ever ordered food for delivery. The people on the phone are always very nice. I have always gotten my food faster than what they tell me. I only gave them four stars because I have to admit that they aren't the best Chinese food that I have ever had. However, they are very consistent and you get great value for your money."}
{"text":"This is good food!  I've been searching for a decent Chinese restaurant and this is it !  Located near Ikea, they deliver to my house.  Here's my assessment:

- Fresh veggies cooked perfectly, just a bit of a crunch, not soggy or frozen. 

- Portions are large. I ordered delivery and the main entree part came in a plastic covered dish and held a lot more than a regular to go box. An order of crab puffs comes with 8.

- Egg rolls are so yummy. I'm from the northeast and they remind of the kind I had when I was a kid (craziest of all? They're only $1 each)

- The prices are great, especially for the amount you get.  My entire order 16 crab puffs, 2 egg rolls, moo shu, sesame chicken, white rice, plus delivery charge and tax = $32. 

-The food came hot. We had to let my son's chicken cool a little before he ate it.

-The name \"Hot Wok Mr. Cook New York Style Chinese\" rocks! I just like saying it...\"Let's order from Hot Wok Mr. Cook.\".

- The location of Hot  Wok Mr. Cook is in Tempe on Warner. There is another Hot  Wok in Chandler on Ray & McQueen.  There seems to be a little confusion on the web about these two. The review I'm making is on the TEMPE one, on the SEC of Warner & Kyrene in the Home Depot center."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Home Depot next door for years and never even noticed this place until I read about it on Yelp. Decided to grab takeout and wasn't disappointed. And hey, they even have awesome SCALLION PANCAKES which are pretty hard to find around here. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have Hot Wok deliver to my work at least once every weekend. They are normally very prompt and the food is really good. The first item i Purchased was their Priciest one, the Five Stars Around Moon. I loved it. If you're looking for Chinese delivery, give this place a shot. Also, I realized their online menu really is down ALL THE TIME, so I uploaded some pics of the one that I had at work, so we all can use it. :) Happy Yelping."}
{"text":"I'm no meat expert, but I'm pretty sure this \"beef\" is not edible unless you want food poisoning for 2 weeks. They were very kind in partially refunding me though."}
{"text":"Worst Asian food ever. Either had no taste or only tasted like salt. I am not sure what the soup was, but it wasn't like any Hot and Soup I've ever had.  \"Pork\" egg rolls had no pork we could find in them, pot stickers had such thick wrappers it was like eating pasta. Never will we order from this place again. Seriously this was just nasty."}
{"text":"I haven't visited Hot Wok, but order delivery almost religiously for our biweekly game nights. Delivery is fairly prompt, usually within about 40 minutes (ordering for 6 people), although we've seen orders arrive in as little as 20.  Portions are large for the price, usually lasting me a few meals.

So far, my favorite dishes are the curry chicken, garlic chicken (emphasis on garlic), and Hot Wok-style chicken. The chicken egg foo yung isn't the most flavorful, but it's tasty, and a bit of Chinese mustard really makes the dish.  The egg rolls are decent. The steamed pork dumplings are amazing, and the crab won tons are some of the best I've tasted.

While I can't speak for the dining-in experience, I highly recommend their food."}
{"text":"I knew I was in a NY style Chinese place as soon as I saw the huge poster-sized paper menus. It seems like every Chinese place I ever ate at as a kid before moving to Arizona had that exact menu. I knew right then that I would like this place.

I ordered the spicy eggplant, and they happily added tofu to the order at my request. It was very good and full of flavor, but I will ask for it to be a little spicier next time. 

Overall, it's a pretty good Chinese place. It's reasonably priced and the portions are just right. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We received a flier for this restaurant through the door and decided to give it a chance.  I was extremely disappointed with our food. Our order was missing the starter we ordered but the main problem was that  the food was inedible. It smelled of fish upon opening, I got beef and my partner got chicken both smelled horrible and tasted disgusting. The entire order had to be thrown in the trash as it was completely inedible.  I would never order food here again."}
{"text":"I placed my order and they gave me the wrong food and when I called the guy just asked me what my problem was and said that if I didn't like it to not order there anymore and I won't... Not after that treatment"}
{"text":"I don't have a lot to say here...I ordered delivery and should have known better than to order Chinese delivery.

The food was delicious.  I have no complaints about the taste except that the chicken tasted a little...off...but was perfectly seasoned.  It just had the texture of raw chicken, but I couldn't tell with the sauce and seasoning.

Had I not woken up with extreme food poisoning, I would have given this place 5 stars.  But I woke up with food poisoning and hadn't eaten anything the day before but Hot Wok Mr. Cook. 

I am entirely open to the thought that I got a bad batch of chicken and this never happens.  But I got food poisoning.  As such, I give 2 stars for the fantastic taste of everything except the chicken that made me sick."}
{"text":"I am so glad to find Hot Wok--finally, Chinese food that is delicious and close to home--a good option for take-out or delivery, and it's open late.  They call it N.Y. Style, and maybe that's why I like it so much.  I love the Shrimp w/ Eggplant w/ garlic sauce.  I get it most every time I order."}
{"text":"Hot Wok Mr. Cook.
I have been into the actual establishment twice. I have ordered delivery on many occasion. I don't know what New York style means, if it means damn good chinese food, then well done.  When in New York I will ask that they do it Hot Wok Mr. Cook style, because if it's that good to be copied then they will know what I'm talking about right?"}
{"text":"Pros: The sesame chicken was good and flavorful. We were going to order orange chicken but they told us they wouldn't make that with white meat, but that the sesame chicken was white meat. Eh, whatever. We got the sesame, and it tasted a lot like a good orange chicken. Crispy breaded morsels in a not too sweet orange colored sauce. The pan fried pork dumplings were also pretty tasty, though they did come plain with no garnish with a small side of soy type dipping sauce.

Cons: My wife and were looking for a place with good moo shu chicken. There's nothing like a fresh made crepe, plum sauce, and chicken with vegetables tossed with egg and sauce. The first bad sign was store bought crepes. Fine, no biggy. But then we both took one bite of the moo shu, looked at each other, and spit it out. It was very wrong. The white meat chicken tasted like it had turned or something. It was sour and smelled weird. Absolutely disgusting. We won't be back. 
Also, the \"roast pork\" eggrolls were very plain, had no detectable meat of any kind, and did not come with any dipping sauce. They probably came from a grocery store. We ate them cold and dry. 
Lastly, the inside of the store smelled bad, like rotting food. Within 10 minutes I was used to it, as they must be.  I could see into the kitchen and people were hard at work over deep friers and it looked clean enough, but they must not be cleaning out a nearby refrigerator or something. 

Overall I'm sure there are things here like the sesame chicken and dumplings that are pretty darn good. But after this experience we won't be risking it."}
{"text":"Good news, bad news here.  Unfortunately, the good news is that it's really good food and pretty reasonably priced.

The bad news is that we got delivery last night and used a brand new credit card that we'd had for 6 months and never used.  Guess what happened today?  Visa fraud called and said that the card number was used 3 times before they caught it.

If I stretch the benefit of the doubt really far, it still ads up to someone connected to this restaurant ganked my credit card number.  Maybe they wrote it down and didn't shred it and some bum dug it out of their garbage, but I dont' care.  Somehow the info was misused. 

So now I'll either have to go there or pay cash for delivery, or go back to my old stand-bys, Golden Eggroll or Chopstick Express.  Bummer, because neither of those has fried bread!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried it out a few months ago because of their New York Style tag line.  We were glad to have found it. Super fairly priced, delicious and definitely NY Style. Hard to put in to words but the Lo Mein is right and the Egg Foo Young is perfect.  I tried their Pork and Eggplant for the first time today and it is just as good. Super fresh eggplant and the sauce has a good flavor.  Everything tastes made to order and it seems like it is.
The service is functional and polite. No forced conversation and they smile and get everything ordered and brought out right each time.  The seating is functional as well - I am yet to see someone sitting inside - it is pretty much all take out.

Get the Egg Foo Young. Have a good meal. It has been consistently good for 5 meals or so over several months. Our go to for chinese takeout"}
{"text":"I like the food. It's tasty and you get such large portions for the money I always get 2-3 meals out of it. In fact, I never even finish my pork fried rice. Really good Hot and Sour soup. Their eggrolls are fantastic. Also, the egg foo yung is delish! I can tell they make it their and not serve up the frozen stuff."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first because the place looked dated and no one else was there to eat. Was greeted warmly and was given recommendations off of the vast menu. I ordered a small wonton soup and the eggplant chicken with garlic sauce. 10 minutes later a man (the cook I assume) brought me my food and thanked me for waiting. 

The food was delicious! Large portion enough for 2 hungry people. Full of flavor and not too salty. My takeout order has everything I needed including an assortment of sauces. 

I will be back for sure. This is a family owned business and I like to support those."}
{"text":"something very important in a restaurant is Service and honesty, I used to order food from this place but after what they were trying to do to me I will never order from here again.  So, I had the menu in my hand and ordered some food, I wanted to switch an item and called back 1 minute later to switch one of the items, she was trying to charge me way more than what it said in the menu, I asked her why is she trying to charge me 9.99 for an item that says 7.75 or around that, she said, oh well is special what is special? dont you charge what the menu says? she was rude and I just cancelled the order.   I will not deal with restaurants like this one that are not honest at all.     I can go to any of the many chinese restaurants in the area and I will send an email to my job about this place so they don't go there anymore, yep 200 employees."}
{"text":"They still rock the wok.  

I got the broccoli shrimp this visit and I was pleased as was DD with his old fave:   wor won ton soup.  The sauce on mine wasn't as great as their moo goo gai pan.  I'm used to a lighter white wine sauce which allows the delicate flavor of shrimp and broccoli through but it was still good if a little dark and heavy.  My un-initiated colleague opted for the one non-Chinese item on the menu and was underwhelmed by his chicken teriyaki.  I admonished him and am re-posting my approval of this strange little takeout place that still only bears the sign \"Chinese Food\" on its storefront."}
{"text":"Man was I disappointed!  I ordered for delivery and was told it would take 20-30 minutes, it actually took an hour and 20 to arrive.  So first impression not the best but it got here and was hot and smelled really good. I got the food opened and started serving and when I scooped into the curry chicken I was disgusted.  The chicken was raw, very raw. It was so bad I was afraid to try any of the food. I called to tell them what happened and it didn't seem to matter much but they did give me my money back. I was really hoping it would be good because my husband and I have been looking for Chinese delivery place in the area. After that experience my search continues."}
{"text":"Now I get why the reviews are so bad-- the food sucks!!!! I mean really gross and the flavor is (anxiety inducing) terrible! Our regular place was closed and after being abroad for over a week just wanted to pick take out up on the way home from the airport -- HUGE mistake! Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Wow was this a find. So good. It is just a small place in a Home Depot shopping center. Off on one side. You wouldn't know it was there. It doesn't look like much from the outside. It is one of those place that looks like the food could be really good or it could make you sick. Luckily it is really good.
A few of my coworkers have been here a few times and they seemed to like it. So I thought I would give it a shot. Glad I did.
I got the chicken chow mien with pork fired rice and wonton soup for only $5 and some change. That is right $5 for any lunch special. And they do not just give you a little scoop of food either. The box was full of noodles and rice. There was also a lot of chicken with the noodles and a lot of pork in the rice. I could barely finish. It was so good I couldn't stop eating but I had to because I was full. The wontons in the soup were great. The broth was very flavorful too. The pork fired rice was some of the best. The noodles in the chow mien were just right. Everything was cooked just right and oh so good. They also got the food out pretty quickly too. No 20 minute wait so you don't have time to eat when you get back to the office.
It was a ton of food for $5. I will definitely be back. I want to try the other lunch selections too. Sometimes the little unassuming places are the best. Good to know there is great Chinese food within minutes of my work."}
{"text":"Yuck. Fried rice plain, no egg. Dumblings tasted weird and didn't care for hot n sour soup. Then felt sick afterwards. Never again."}
{"text":"They have good food depending on what you get. I get a their hot and sour soup and it tastes great... But the problem is that I have found pieces of metal wire in my food and I will not be going back. Their service could improve a lot as well, it is not a friendly environment."}
{"text":"This is actually one of my favorite Chinese food places. Their service does leave something to be desired in person. However, their food is really good & their delivery is pretty fast! My favorites are the sweet and sour chicken, the pot stickers are to die for! Their Hot & Sour soup is packed with veggies and flavor. The chicken and broccoli is really yummy too. I can't lie their fried chicken wings are some of the best around. So, just order delivery and kick back to get your Grubb on!"}
{"text":"The House Lo Mein, still the real deal, but DON'T get the coconut shrimp.  Trust me"}
{"text":"I still can't believe how much food you get for the price and how quick the service is. After moving from Chicago, I never realized how hard it would be to get GOOD Chinese food in other places, 'til I found Hot Wok. It's a little rough around the edges and the guy who usually answers the phone is ridiculously mumbled and rather deadpan, but the quality of the food and the price makes up for it!"}
{"text":"They have some really solid items/plates on the menu but then drop off on some others that are sub par. The Sesame Chicken is delicious while the Empress Chicken is strictly mediocre. The pricing is pretty fair but the establishments lack of flexibility is a little frustrating. If your family platters consist of 3 entrees and then some soup and egg rolls you shouldn't just make people choose 1 of 4 bundle options, let them CHOOSE the entrees they want!"}
{"text":"So good!! We ordered teriyaki chicken, pork lo mein and beef with mixed vegetables.  All proteins were so flavorful and moist. The vegetables were crisp, the noodles and rice were cooked perfect
 It has been so long since we have found a good Chinese restaurant. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Hot Wok. They definitely give you your moneys worth. I have never had a bad meal here, as they are always consistent and fresh. Everything I have tried is amazing and the portions are very large, enough that even the lunch specials are so much food I have leftovers for several days.
The NY style chinese is simply amazing, the quality, the freshness of the veggies and meats they simply cannot be beat. Also they have the best shrimp n chicken egg rolls in town. HW's soups are amazing,  If you're into looks and ambiance you will be disappointed. HW is better than Chinese sit down restaurants.. and without the flair. Here you get freshness, non greasy flavorful Chinese food made to order, it's a winner!

For Great NY Style Chinese, go to hot wok...

 I'm glad they're not close or I would be in trouble"}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp fried rice for takeout. It was hot, but bland. No scrambled egg, which is a basic fried rice ingredient. The rice was on the dry side, and everyone in our party agreed that soy sauce was needed to give it some flavor. I'll give it another try and sample more menu items, but this isn't a good start."}
{"text":"I have ordered for here many many times, it's the only Chinese I will eat, the rest is crap. Be prepared for the worst service ever, typically the don't say hello, just \"what do you want\" and when you order they just hang up on you, it's so bad it's actually kind of funny. I'm sure most people would cry about it, but I love these guys! Easily Best egg rolls in town."}
{"text":"Just finished a worst of the worst experience with Hot Wok Mr Cook.  We rate the food a solid 2 out of 10 and service a fat zero.

We called in and ordered the pork egg foo young combo, chicken chow mein combo and an order of sweet and sour chicken.  I specifically did NOT want chicken lo mein and the non-English speaking person on the phone was queried several times to ensure order was chicken CHOW mein.  After ordering process made lengthy and diffic.ult due to lack of English proficiency, we were told meals would be delivered within an hour.  After more than 90 minutes passed we repeatedly called for five minutes with two phones until someone answered.  We were given excuse that it was Friday and assured food should arrive soon, which it did.

Unfortunately the meals were not as ordered.  The gravy for the egg foo young was forgotten, and we were delivered - SURPRISE - chicken lo mein.  In addition to messing up two of three meals ordered, the quality and taste were extremely lacking.  This is bottom of the barrel Chinese folks - yucko.  The no gravy egg foo young tasted best, while the fried rice was bland and just 95% rice colored with soy.  The sweet and sour chicken was soggy, not crisp - and the sauce of the fake variety bought in large cans at grocery co-ops.  I managed to choke down half the chicken lo mein, which consisted of noodles and upon close examination a few small bits of what may have been chicken and vegetables.  More of our dinner went in the trash than in the mouth.

Upon discovery of the errors, we had again called back.  Management shrugged their shoulders over the mistakes and told us they would offer some kind of discount the next time we ordered.  We gladly informed Hot Wok that due to mistakes in 2 of 3 meals and very poor quality of food we had no desire to ever try their \"food\" again.

Stay away everyone - this is seriously lowball bottom of the barrel \"Chinese\" (a stretch of the word).  Much better abounds all around - visit Hot Wok and you'll be sorry!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best take out in the area! I was starving when I got home and they left a flyer in my door. Lucky me I gave them a shot. Best cream cheese wonton I've had in a long time. Tsos chosen is great too"}
{"text":"Do NOT waste your time with this rude joke. 

I called to place a delivery order... Was in the MIDDLE of my order, when he put me on \"hold\" to answer another call. 

Unfortunately for this vendor- \"hold\" was live and I could hear this guy putting me on the backburner while he took someone else's call for takeout ahead of mine.

I asked WHY I had to wait for someone who called in AFTER me... After waiting on hold for 15 minutes... The guy literally said \"f*** you\" and hung up.

Not only have I not tried this place- DONT WANT TO! Good luck, jerks! 

And don't hang your trash on my doorknob again."}
{"text":"Our family loves Hot Wok Mr Cook. 

I use to come here once a month, around the time I would go to All Family Barber for a hair cut. Sadly All Family is closed, but I still enjoy stopping here for a take out order whenever I'm in the area. 

The food has a mostly east coast Chinese flavor to it, meaning it's has strong Szechwan or Sichuan influence. Szechuan is known for its slightly spicy taste. They use a lot of garlic and chili peppers, as well as Sichuan pepper in their food, which our family likes.

We usually get Fried Pot Stickers/Dumplings, Szechwan Won Tons, General Tso's Chicken, Sweat & Sour Chicken and Pork Fried Rice. All of which were very good and it had only a mild, spicy kick to it. 

Expect to pay around $40, after their 10% Off coupon which is attached to their printed Take Out menu. See attached photos."}
{"text":"Terrible, dangerous and doesn't care!!!

After having eaten this place a handful of times in the past, I opted to view it as just a quick and cheap version of lunch. Nothing amazing, nothing terrible.... until now. Not only did we receive raw chicken and end up with violent food poisoning, our shrimp dish came with 2 pieces of shrimp, the rice was old and (not refried) reheated, and none of our vegetables were even seared let alone cooked. We are now dealing with missed work, doctors co pays for anti-emetics and overall aggravation at the staff who have no sympathy or concern over the quality of their food. This turned a $5.50 per lunch special into a costly event....

DO NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Its alright.... delivery is cool. Foods been pretty good. Cons... menus always down online."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Yesterday ordered food for the whole office. Three of the meals, including mine, were chicken dishes. Guess what. All the chicken dishes were cold and raw pink in the middle. Every single piece of chicken was RAW! One stupid coworker ate it all anyways. Guess what. He's throwing up as we speak. My boss is a kidney transplant recipient. If he would have ate the food, he would have died. So my boss called them today and chewed them out. All the guy said was \"Bring back food and we give refund.\" Uh... we threw the raw chicken away. Be very careful if you are going to eat here. I use to come here often and ignored the reviews about raw food. No more. I will not risk it. I will not even return for a refund. Please be careful if you are going to eat here. Could be your last meal."}
{"text":"I ordered my food, food was horrible, called to complain and the lady on the phone told me that it was good and that I was wrong, argues with me and offered no options. I do a lot of the ordering at my work, aprox 20-30- of us and this place is no longer on our list. The last time we ordered from work the fried rice was so old that it could have blown away in the wind. I would avoid this place, these places are a dime a dozen, There is definitely a place that offers better service and better food."}
{"text":"Typical strip mall chinese restaurant where they have 800 things on their menu but could probably give you 800 reasons not to go back.

The tiny plate and whimpy plastic utensils made it close to impossible to make the best of the below average food.

I wanted to stick my fingers down my throat when I walked out the door. 

I ordered the L29, but it didn't resemble any L29 I've ever had before."}
{"text":"I've had some horrible Chinese food delivered recently.

I got spring rolls nothing special but exactly what you would imagine. I was not disappointed by them. 

Finally, edible duck! The last few places I ordered from it went in the trash, almost immediately. The general tso's was tasty. Great shrimp fried rice."}
{"text":"Very good food, I had the Curry Chicken that was very tasty. The fried ragoons and egg role were quite good too. I had enough for two servings."}
{"text":"War Wonton soup... Not bad! Not awesome but definitely not bad. Teriyaki chicken... Well, it's teriyaki chicken. The 'special' shrimp and scallops... Not really scallops. More like baby pieces of fish that resemble scallops... Delivery was super fast! I'm just down Warner on McClintock so that helps. They included fried wontons and all sauces which was nice."}
{"text":"One of the best chinese restaurants around the area. We have ordered take out 3x within the past month and are never disappointed. You must try the pork dumplings (steamed). So much meat in it and the sauce that comes with it is a great compliment to the appetizer. The hot and sour soup and egg drop soup are good too. When you order those soups to go, you get a lot for what you pay for (which is very reasonably priced for the size you want)."}
{"text":"Love Hot Wok! Great prices during lunch...always fresh and flavorful! My favorite is shrimp w mixed vegetables! Love that I can call in and in 5 minutes its ready..hot and fresh! Employees pretty quiet but nice....atmosphere is nothing to brag about..could definitely use a tv and some wall art for some color! All in all if you want fresh tasty affordable Chinese food check them out!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, had everything inside the bag nice and neat.   The establishment is very clean. 
Great customer service.  
Thank you :-)"}
{"text":"I so wish you could do 3 1/2 stars.  i would give it. 

Not bad chinese.  NYC style.  If you have lived in or around NYC you would completely understand.

I LOVE the Fried Dumplings.  SO GOOD!!  Highly recommend them.  Pork Lomein is good to.   Take out for sure.  Not really a place to sit and eat.  you can do it but it is more geared for take out."}
{"text":"This neiborhood take out has always made my family happy. I have had each type of chicken (lots of options) and they are always fresh. Don't forget egg rolls!"}
{"text":"We received a flyer on our door for this restaurant and decided to try it for take out.  I read most of the Yelp reviews and for the most part, they were fairly positive.  I did read the negative reviews but decided to take them with a grain of salt as some people are just inherently hard to please.  

Picked up the food, brought it straight home and noticed right away that none of it was very hot.  Most of it seemed just above room temperature, but even that didn't deter me as I was starving this particular day.  

I microwaved my egg drop soup and began to eat.  It was a bit bland, but otherwise fine.  Next, I tried the szechuan green beans.  These were very yummy.  I really like them.  Then I tried the fried rice, but it was also a bit bland and quite dry.  Needed soy to be able to eat it.  

My bf got the Mongolian Beef.  It looked great.  It also tasted great.  Then I tried my House Chow Mein.  First bite, woah this is really tasty too.  I was happy.  Then I dug in for the 2nd bite.  I immediately noticed something a little too pink/red and then proceeded to dig out many pieces of under-cooked meat just from the top of the dish.   I immediately closed it up as I wasn't going to eat a dish with raw meat.  Yuck, gross!  After all, I had read a few reviews where other people had similar experiences and didn't notice at first and then ended up ill.  I was actually worried about eating the other food due to cross contamination concerns, but I was so hungry I ate my fill of the other dishes.  Here I am a day later with no ill effects.  Yay! Lol.   

So, to conclude, order and eat at your own risk.  Definitely pay attention to the meat in your dish to make sure it is thoroughly cooked.  I wasn't convinced that the meat in the Mongolian Beef dish was cooked through, but beef is a bit different than chicken, and my bf ate it with no negative side effects.  

I will NOT order from this restaurant again!  Raw meat at a Chinese place is a big no, no for me, especially as they are known to use lower quality cuts of meat to begin with.  It's a shame, as the main dishes all had excellent flavor, which makes me understand the other high ratings.  But there are too many other options available to risk food poisoning. My advice to the restaurant:  take an extra 2-3 minutes and actually COOK the food.  Make sure it's done and is hot!"}
{"text":"For years now I have been disappointed time and time again by Chinese restaurants around the valley. I really thought there was just no good Chinese food to be found. Until Hot Wok! Finally, real, good Chinese food!!

Hot Wok is BY FAR the best I have found. The portions are huge and the prices are good. I can order a small and get two meals from it.

My favorite is the chicken with mixed vegetables. The chicken is not breaded and the veggies are a nice mix - broccoli, carrots, zucchini, mushrooms, water chestnuts and onion. It's served in a sauce that is so flavorful my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I've also had the chicken with string beans and that was tasty as well.

A favorite of the boyfriend is the pineapple chicken. Breaded chicken with a tangy fruity sauce and big chunks of pineapple.

Their cream cheese wontons are good too but it's pretty hard to mess those up.

This is definitely a take-out place. They do have tables, but it's nothing special."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and like it for multiple reasons.
1.  Convenient
2.  Good food
3.  Good prices
4.  Most entrees are enough for two.
5.  They deliver.
6.  They have coupons right on their menu.
7.  Lunch specials.
8.  Polite staff.

And there are probably a few other things I may have overlooked.
So thankful for the few people that originally posted reviews that brought me to this place.  Even the recommendation for General Tso Chicken was right on."}
{"text":"The only place open near our house after 9:00 pm for Chinese food. Nothing great - the chicken looked kind of disturbingly pale in color - but it's cheap, fast Chinese takeout - and it beats Pei Wei..."}
{"text":"I have been eating at the Hot Wok AKA \"Chinese Food\" for years now... I  did eat in once and it was kind of a cluster of a dive in that place so I block those memories out when ordering deliver. I always order #49 Moo Shu Beef, #149 Mongolian style Lamb and some egg rolls. The Moo Shu Beef has to be the best I have found so far around Arizona and I love the lamb dish as well always a great place to have great food delivered."}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan I have to say. I was really excited when my food arrived in 15 minutes... like really excited. That's Jimmy John's delivery quick. It looked very well packaged but that's about where the experience stops being fantastic.

I love my spice... don't get me wrong. I usually order my Thai on the high end of the spice scale. Spice is a great way to get a flavorful dish. It also can reveal the caliber of the place you are ordering from. Typically a take out Chinese establishment is not going to offer a scale for their spice. It's not a Thai restaurant. They simply indicate with a little pepper when something is going to be spicy.

My dish which was a scallop dish was very overpowering on the spice end, and not in a good way. The spice completely overpowered my food and any good flavor that could've resulted. 

I may try it again and order a non spicy dish to see how that ends up, but for now, it's out of rotation on my take out list."}
{"text":"The food wasn't all that good for the price. They took forever to deliver and it was cold by the time it got to me. Would not order from again."}
{"text":"If you grew up somewhere where there is no dinky little restaurants do not go there - You will be shocked! Shit, i grew up in NYC and i was a bit surprised, especially after living in Phoenix for a while. Their advertisement of NY Style Chinese Food is quite correct - dinky little place between nail saloon and bread store, disgusting dirty dishes on plastic beat up tables, some pimply asian teen who does not speak much English behind a counter, a \"Chef\" reading Chinese news paper in the corner chair. WOW Home sweet home! 

Since i called in and placed my order i did not have to wait too long, perhaps 3-5 min or so. Then i been given a bag with some boxes and told \"Want somsing else? Its sere, in corner. Sank u, bye\" Great, we will not go hungry tonight!!! So, i take it home and we dig in. Alright cool!!! They did not forget my free egg roll, very nice of them and i did not even need to remind anyone (Alright, i forgot myself!)

At the end it was pretty nice dinner. They had somewhat hard to find Singaporean Noodle dish and i got that and was not disappointed - It tasted quite good and was not too greasy. Amazing Chicken was not so amazing but not too bad all in all. 

Not quite NYC caliber Chinese food, but not too bad. As long as you try not to think about sanitary conditions there. But hey, growing up in Brooklyn has its benefits, you learn to see past some things LOL 

\"I like\""}
{"text":"Dude picked this up one night on the way home from work. They've been sticking menus in our door for over a year now, so it was time. 

We got . . . 

1) Mongolian Beef with Fried Rice
2) Quart of Hot and Sour Soup 

All of this came out to around $14.  

Seriously some of the best fried rice around. Not too greasy. Heavy handed with the stir fried vegetables in the beef, which was great. No sauce overdose like that one corporate Chinese place loves to do. 

I wasn't expecting a whole lot from the Hot and Sour soup, but it was fresh and filling. Mix in some of that rice and Sriracha and you're golden.

Can't wait to try out some of the other offerings."}
{"text":"Live this place closest place to Chicago Chinese food I can find. Best everything. Even the small shop feeling and love that they speak broken English. I recommend this place unless your Donald Trump."}
{"text":"The best Chinese I have had in Arizona. The food is not greasy, pretty well-made and the prices are very reasonable. I love that I can substitute brown rice at no additional cost. Their lunch specials are awesome for the price and for what they give you. I sometimes ask my husband to pick it up on the way home from work as he drive up the 101."}
{"text":"Ordered from this place on a whim. We needed to go to Home Depot and this place is next door. We ordered broccoli beef and kung pao chicken. It wasn't the best but it also wasn't the worst. It had good flavor. The kung pao was lacking the spiciness I hoped for. All and all I would order from this place again. The girl who took my order was friendly and it didn't take a long for our order. My fiancé also liked that they threw in some spicy mustard and duck sauce along with the soy sauce. I gave them 4 stars for the customer service and good food at a decent price."}
{"text":"Always a place I MUST visit when I'm in town. My go-to's: cashew chicken, beef and broccoli, fried rice. The white boy Chinese selection :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here now three times - 1 dinner and 2 lunches and I will come back.  I have looked long and hard for spicy green beans and this restaurant has it.  I wasn't too impressed with the order containing beef but the green beans by themselves were outstanding.  Their egg roll was also crisp and tasty and likewise for their fried rice.  The food comes hot and fast (although I haven't used delivery yet) and their prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this place based on the reviews here.  I ordered my favorite dish which is General Tso Chicken and white rice.  The rice was fine but the chicken chunks tasted just average.  I went at about 10pm last night (08/25/2012).  I am thinking about trying this restaurant once more just to see if it is better the next time."}
{"text":"Terrible, awful food. All of it. What a waste. Sooo bummed.  They get 1 star for speedy delivery - to get rid of old food, I assume. Spring rolls look like they were re-wrapped after numerous of times in the fryer. Trash can seemed grateful when I took it all to the dumpster instead, as I didn't want the house smelling like day old grease. And the \"meat\" in our entrees was highly questionable. This was at 4pm on a Saturday  :("}
{"text":"My search for the perfect plate of General Tso's chicken has taken me to dozens of Chinese food restaurants, large and small, all over the country.  I can say with confidence that this place is one of the better Chinese food restaurants out there.

I was not familiar with \"New York style\" Chinese food before, but apparently it means dingy restaurant, ugly chairs and tables, the same generic menu that you've seen dozens of times before, flimsy plastic eating utensils, and damn good food.  

I will overlook all of the meh that is on the exterior of this place for the fact that they serve what I consider to be the best General Tso's chicken in Arizona that I have found so far."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and the food got here faster than expected! The delivery man was very nice and considerate. The food was pretty delish too! It was very tasty and wasn't bad or anything; it's not the most amazing Chinese food out there, but for the price and convenience, it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I don't recall when the menu arrived at the door.  I'm thinking it was one of those door-to-door paper hangers that troll the neighborhood first thing in the morning.  When I get it and read the name of the place, it first intreges me and almost gets a chuckle out of the Chinglish name, \"Hot Wok Mr. Cook New York Style Chinese\".  My boys pick up on the name and start calling it by the South Park slang for \"City Wok\" (it's crude, but funny).

This place is no joke.  I drove over and ordered a selection of their fare and it was good, I mean real good for take-out.  It's not as pedestrian as, say, Pei Wei, but good.  My oldest took one bite out of his eggroll and before he could swallow it the youngest stole it from him and snarfed it down.  Both agreed that it was excellent even without sauce.  I had the General Tsu chicken, which was a huge portion, and wolfed it down without even pausing to belch.  Very good food, the decor is spartan and I have no idea about delivery."}
{"text":"I've never been to their restaurant before, so I can speak for the dining experience. But delivery is usually quick and their food is pretty good. Their orange chicken is still my favorite thing on the menu. It's definitely one of the best delivery Chinese food I've been able to find in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Zero response to this customer's repeated claim of food poisoning both me AND my cat. I was insulted, yelled at in the background, told I was wrong.  They paper neighborhoods with flyers and I cringe at the thought of others getting sick from their food."}
{"text":"Ordered two nights ago. The male who took my delivery order stole my debit card info. Luckily my bank blocked the $230 charge at some merchant in Indiana.

I have a theory. If the guy who took my order was also the delivery driver. He may have been upset with a $4 tip when it was raining. When I wrote the tip, he was mentioning something about it. but the rain and his accent I couldn't understand him but I pretended I did.


I had the intention of a $8 cash tip, brain fart and routine kicked in. The food was delivered, but it was tossed aside. 


There is a review from 2010, her info was stolen too."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is great.  I've lived here since 1997 and have been searching for good Chinese food ever since, and seriously, this little hole in the wall place is the best!  We order delivery or pick up at least once a week and are always happy with the food. The scallion pancakes are THE BEST!  You have to try them."}
