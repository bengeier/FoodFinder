{"text":"If you wish to eat at a place where the staff sits at the door making sure that your not \" just trying to use the bathroom\" this isn't your place. However if you find yourself in need of a restroom, I suggest waiting for a group entering restaurant and try to slide past the maitre d along with them , then make your dash toward the free restroom. Otherwise you will be faced with purchasing a 3 dollar coffee that is old and been sitting on the pot for hours. You should be sitting on the pot, not the coffee!"}
{"text":"a throwback joint on the cusp of being a dive (which I happen to love!).  based on the other reviews i knew I had to try some sort of corned beef today. ordered the corned beef hash with two eggs sunny side up.  first bite - swoooooon!  second bite - hey there, SALT!!!  I am guessing my meal was salted by mistake (a few extra times) back in the kitchen.  I ate as much as I could because truly, underneath the salt mine on my plate, was some damn fine corned beef hash!  though i don't think I'd make a special trip to KIOTB from my home in the 'burbs, when I'm next downtown i might pop in again and give the hash a second chance. forgive and forget, right?"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a chef salad during a short stop at BKL. (Short drive, and the Landmark people were happy to drive me over). I ended up with some desserts too. Everything was of extremely high quality, and the staff very nice."}
{"text":"This is the best corned beef and pastrami sandwich! Piled high!  My first time there I watched as Karl made mile high pastrami while I waited impatiently for mine. I was not disappointed, fresh food made with care. Don't overlook this Gem.  It's the first place I've eaten in years we're the food looks as good as the photos."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great.  Coffee was perfect and bloody mary's were great.  Service was awesome. Loved the home fries.  Coffee was so great, that the waitress gave me a couple of bags for the road :).  It would appear this is only place to eat breakfast downtown cleveland on a Sunday.  At first we were worried it was going to be awful... but it was worth the walk through the snow.  Would return if i am ever in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"It is surprisingly difficult to find a diner in walking distance of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Karl's seemed to be the only choice, at least from the direction we were coming from. So I was a bit worried that our day might start off on the wrong note. But no, we had a great breakfast, nothing fancy but very friendly and swift service. Usual diner fare but done well. No worries,  as they say in Oz."}
{"text":"Warm welcoming atmosphere and amazing Reuben sandwich.  The staff and owner are very friendly, service was great, and the Reuben was excellent (and huge).  Thanks again, will not hesitate to visit again next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We stopped in after work last night to grab dinner. Karl was working behind the front counter and said we could sit anywhere we wished.   Karl's Inn is a comfortable unassuming spot where you can unwind and relax.   He brought menus right over and took our drink orders.   I had the corned beef on rye sandwich which was huge. The corned beef was thinly sliced, moist and full of flavor. I added a slice of Swiss cheese too. It was too big to finish so I took it home for today's lunch.   I am a sucker for a good corned beef sandwich and have eaten them all over the country. This one was one of the best I have ever eaten.   My DH ordered a cheeseburger that came with fries. You can get a choice of cheese for topping. The meat was cooked just the way he ordered it and was bigger than the bun. It was thick and full of flavor.   The fries were nicely crisp on the outside but soft on the inside. Just the way they should be served.   We took a couple of cookies home for today. They were big, chewy and really good.   Karl took good care of us and we were very happy with everything. We will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Cup of coffee with Karl's grandslam equals 2 eggs, 3 thin threads of bacon, 2 stale reheated pancakes that lacks the fluffy that makes pancakes pancakes and a $27 bill total. If you ask me, that's a high price to pay for low budget meal. Aside from Karl's straightforwardness to help and a compliment cup of coffee, it would be unfair of me to not point out that $27 is worth a lot more."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Karl's ever since my girl friend and I were walking to our car after a Cleveland Browns game years ago.  After our initial visit, we have returned 2 to 3 times a year from our home in Mansfield, OH.  His reubens melt in your mouth.  His fish is the best.  All of our food is served very hot.  By the way, I am not from San Francisco."}
{"text":"It took us a really long time to find something that was open for breakfast in downtown Cleveland.  But we found it and were pleased!  I had a very bright tasting Bloody Mary and when my glass was half empty it suddenly became full again with the remains in the mixing glass.  I am just going to give you the item by item report:  Pancakes - Great!  Spongy, a little buttery and great flavor. Syrup - House recipe in a package. Sausage - Nothing special, patties, tasty. Karl's Omelet - Fresh veggies, quite good. Ham - Deli type ham, sliced thin. Potatoes -  Why can't everyone make potatoes this good!  They were cut thick, fried potatoes with a nice seasoning.  Really good.    Our total for breakfast, including the Bloody Mary, 3 beers and tip was just under $50.    The service was good. We sat at the bar and while the bartender was not exactly chatty, she was attentive."}
{"text":"(Pretty telling that the reviewers of 1 stars have no friends.  Grouches.)  Karl's is higher in price.  True.  But, the owner will know you if you make yourself known.  He's old school and you can't be mad at that.  Plus, here's a tip- he poured drinks for Frank Sinatra back when Swingo's was a thing in Cleveland, and then he ran the Snuggery.  So, if you want to get a Manhattan poured by the same hand \"Old Blue Eyes\" would trust with his drink?  Come for that experience.  Me?  I go to Karl's for two things- to shake the man's hand who will recognize me, my lady, and any one of my friends who walks through that door on any given day no matter how long it's been.  And two- I go for the Corned Beef.  Being in the restaurant biz, I know who the supplier of his meat is, and I've been to the facility where they prepare the briskets.  I know through and through the quality of it all.  I can attest- it's spot on, Grade A.  And Karl, piles it high on bread that melts in your mouth, and serves it with a crisp pickle.    If you're going to the Browns game- do yourself a favor and stop in here.  Spend the $10 for a sandwich that is butchered in Cleveland, shaved by Karl's, and sold with experience.  If you're looking for a cheap sandwich by an owner that doesn't give a crap about you- there's a Quizno's a hundred feet north."}
{"text":"Best place to get a corned beef sandwich. The staff is awesome. The craft beer selection is limited, but they have at least a little something for everyone."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in a long time. When we got there, some regulars hopped up to let another family have their table. Same regulars then started serving coffee and helping out as it got really busy really quick. Karl's grand slam breakfast was so good. Our teenage boys and I all had one. My husband had the Karl's omelet and the home fries were so good that I kept eating from his plate. :)  It's a cozy place near the courthouse and police department. Our hotel had suggested this or Punch Bowl Social. When I saw mushroom gravy was on the biscuits at other place, I said no way lol. So glad we picked Karl's because it was so good!!! I love biscuits and gravy but not with mushrooms ha."}
{"text":"We found ourselves in Cleveland for lunch and I quickly pulled out my Yelp app to see the best places around town.  The top restaurant close to our location was Slyman's (like everyone mentions below) however, our ride (who is a local) said to go to Karl's or Inn of the Barrister's.  They have a decent selection of interesting sounding sandwiches and burgers.  I ordered the California Club and discovered that I do not like avocado on my sandwiches.  When mentioned to the server, she offered to bring me something else, but I declined and ate it anyway.    Service was great and I really enjoyed all the fun memorabilia on the walls.  If you are flying in to Burke Lakefront Airport, Landmark Aviation will drive and pick you up here.  Karl's will call them when you are ready to leave."}
{"text":"I don't normally give out a single star rating just for pricing, but this place was so disappointing with the size of the meal and quality compared with what they charge that I felt it is a warranted rating. Very little food ($11 for a sandwich without even chips) size serving and the quality was very low par. For all the hassle of getting to this place with it's lousy location and parking situation, and then to be disappointed with the quality, quantity and pricing, it's just not a place I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Service was very slow at lunch.  Took a long time before server came to table and too long for the meal to be brought out.  It was not that busy  Food is just average.  Staff not that friendly. ."}
{"text":"We love Karl's! Especially Karl himself and Renee!! Great service, friendly staff, great local atmosphere! Made our trip to Cleveland. If you are ever in the area you should definitely stumble in. Came for the Yuengling and stayed for the people!"}
{"text":"Spent the night in Cleveland and was looking for a place to have breakfast. Found this place by accident and so glad we did. Karl suggested I forgo breakfast for the pastrami. Glad I listened. If you find yourself in Cleveland find Karls'."}
{"text":"This was my first visit ti Karl's in a few years.  I ordered a chicken salad sandwich on-line thru a new Living Social program.  My order was ready on-time, but I thought that the sandwich was a bit pricey at $10, especially without any sides included.  I think that the restaurant should consider a small side of potato salad, cole slaw or at least some chips or fruit cup.  The ingredients were fresh, including the rye bread that the sandwich was served on, but the salad was very salty.  I probably would not go back, or at the very least,  I wouldn't get a sandwich."}
{"text":"Based on the other Yelp reviews, I decided to stop in here for lunch as I served on jury duty.  The decor looks like one of those places you see in old crime shows where the attorneys would go and celebrate a victory or drown a loss, which is pretty cool.  I sat at the bar and was greeted warmly.  I ordered a California wrap with turkey, bacon, and avocado.  It was very good.  I usually don't have dessert at lunch, but I did this time and was rewarded.  Based on a suggestion from the server, I ordered the lemon cheesecake.  Wow!  It was awesome!  I would recommend this place for lunch if you're at or near the justice center in Cuyahoga County."}
{"text":"If you want a \"run of the mill\" Togo's style sandwich, go ahead and visit one of the other shops listed here. But if you want a GIANT, AUTHENTIC sandwich, this is the place! Not only is the food excellent here, you get to meet and dine with the actual owner, Karl. This place is a legendary fixture of the community! Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches  great coffee great guy..by the Justice center..centrally located... Prices good for downtown..edit..man I just had a bomb corned beef sandwich...."}
{"text":"Place is overpriced and staff very unfriendly. May be better for local ppl but definitely won't recommend for those on a long driving."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast at 12:30 and Karl fired the grill back up for us and made the most delicious breakfast! The sausage was cooked perfectly and had a great spice taste. Not one of us left anything on our plates. Made a great Bloody Mary also."}
{"text":"Yvonne is such a nice lady. My family of three wandered in here from out of town for a quick breakfast. We ate, we laughed, and were pointed in the right direction for a few city sights we wanted to see. I wish we could come back and check out the deli sandwiches. Thank you, and thanks for the cookie!"}
{"text":"I called in to place a pickup order for lunch.  First off, the man who answered the phone was borderline rude.  Didn't ask for my name or give me a total on the order.  Whatever.  I went to go pick it up and he said it was $26 dollars.  For 2 sandwiches!  I had a Groupon so I said what the heck.  He refused to take the Groupon because he said it was only for dinner.  I asked him to show me where on the Groupon it said for dinner only and he refused so I walked out without my order.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Stopped here before the U2 concert. Awesome food! Had the Snuggery Burger & it was excellent. Several quality beer choices on tap as well. Top recommendation!"}
{"text":"We have gone here several times for lunch.  I know Cleveland is so high on Slymans but this place is just as good.  Plus you wont wait in lines that Slymans usually has.  The real name is Karls Inn of the Barristers...located right across from the Justice Center.  This place is a huge bit of Cleveland history with the walls covered in Cleveland memorabilia.  The menu is pretty basic but again very good.  many different and HUGE deli sandwiches.  If you sit at the \"Bar of Justice\" you have a good shot at being served by Karl himself.  You have a choice of potato salad, macaroni salad or real cole slaw.  The deserts in the front case look amazing though I've never tried.  Def recommend Karl's for lunch anytime"}
{"text":"If you're really hungry and want an oversized amount of meat on a sandwich this is a good choice.  Corned beef sandwich was good (well it tasted the same as every other corned beef) but it was too much for me.  WAY taller than I could fit into my mouth.   Bread was the run of the mill Wonder Bready kind .    At $15 (not including tip) for a sandwich and potato salad, this place is on the high side for lunch, by my standards.   But I liked the old fashioned, somewhat divey atmosphere so I would come back, not for lunch, but to grab a drink and maybe a bite before or after a Browns game since it's pretty close to the stadium."}
{"text":"Karl's corned beef and pastrami is second to none in Cleveland. Staff is nice and personable if you take the time to ask. Great for business meetings or just a lunch alone. Sit at the bar and it'll be more enjoyable. Solid for Browns game days. Enjoyable."}
{"text":"I love the corned beef here at Karl's...they totally give Slyman's a run for their money... I've been here once before with work collegues, but I recently went back on St. Patty's Day after a long moring/afternoon of celebrating. Mind you, the Inn was PACKED, (as it should be) but we still managed to get our corned beef in a timely fashion. I wish I could give a more thorough review, but I gotta tell ya, I just LOVE their corned beef :)"}
{"text":"Definitely the best place in Cleveland for corned beef that help was awesome attentive The Corned Beef was cooked to Perfection not salty not dry and the sandwich was enormous definitely a good bang for the buck"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. They have the best corn beef in town and the portions are huge. The owner, Karl is quite the host as well. They also have Dortmunder on draft which seems to becoming a rarity around town."}
{"text":"Mile high Reuben.  Karl's Reuben is to die for-especially if you are a big meat eater-lots of savory corned beef.  The Reuben is so full of meat you can hardly get your mouth open wide enough.  A 1/2 Reuben is so filling you can take the other half to eat later.  Save room for dessert-the choices are awesome-carrot cake, several kinds of cheese cake- I took a slice of pumpkin cheesecake to eat back at hotel.  I believe all made on site- not the frozen box version.  Conveniently located close to First Energy Stadium in downtown Cleveland and walking distance of several hotels- Hilton-Drury Plaza etc,  Small intimate atmosphere and not too loud.  Service is great and prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Karl's has excellent corned beef. Better than Slyman's  but you had to ask to toast the bread. Somewhat pricey and doesn't come with any sides, 4$ to add one. Owners warms up to newcomers quick, didn't take our coupon but gave us free cookies at the end. Will go back next time in Cleveland and try my coupon then. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is just awful.  Old, dirty, outdated.  I have been here dozens of times for quick meetings or with various groups, solely due to the proximity to work.  Each time, I'm amazed that people continually choose this place - I have never chosen this place on my own.  The chairs/booths are rickety, and once a stray staple holding a chair together tore my pantsuit.  Half of the ladies' room was recently out of order for months.  Not at all a place for professionals, but I suppose it's fine if you're waiting for the bus after your meeting with the county probation office that is next door.  My partner has actually refused to go here anymore because the cocktails are vomitous.  We noticed that that simple drinks (e.g., vodka + soda, draft beer) all had the same \"earthy\" taste because the lines are filthy, and this has been the case for at least the last three years.  So now I pay between $4 and $5 for a bottled domestic beer whenever I have to go to this place (again, only due to work).  The sandwiches are absurdly overpriced, especially for the quality.  There are too many restaurants within walking distance that can give you better food for the price.  You can EASILY walk to an actual restaurant run by a famous chef and pay $15 for a sandwich.  It is true that the owner, Karl, can be a nice person.  But he's not a chef (IN THE LEAST), definitely not a bartender, or a server.  He lords over the place and gives snacks when he feels like it.  And that's just fine if, given everything else, you're expecting a shitty dive bar.  Maybe this place should rebrand itself as that."}
{"text":"Two slices of toast - check! A few strips of crispy crispy bacon - check! One egg - fried - check! One slice of cheese - check! It was EXACTLY what I wanted. I could not have made it better myself. Simple, straight forward and really tasty. PLUS I had room for lunch 4 hours later! PERFECT.   Thanks Karls!"}
{"text":"This place is way over priced and the staff were really rude."}
{"text":"I did not like the corn beef at all it was like rubber not worth my 12 dollars I was very disappointed"}
{"text":"Best Rubens in Town! Great family owned restaurant. Worth checking out if your in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"I make special trips to go here.    I love this bar/restaurant My friends and I found it by accident and I keep going back for drinks, food and to say hi to Karl. You see Karl is not just a name on the building but he is also the owner, a bartender and makes sure his sandwiches are stacked high!    Karl is great. Go in on a weeknight and find that out yourself. I did and now even during its super busy times (before a browns game or on St Patricks day) he will still stop and chat with me and my husband for a second.   Drinks. Priced like any other place down town and they have a good pour.   Food. Sandwiches are huge! I definitely cannot eat one in one sitting. Friggin awesome and worth every cent.   Find yourself downtown? Do yourself a favor and accidentally find Karl's (psst it's across the street from the Justice Center on West 3rd). You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Yesterday Cleveland was \" Crazyland\" and after the parade we were tired and starving. Most restrants from East 4th to West 6th were a minimum of an hour and 45 min. wait. However, we were 3 blocks away from Karl's and I knew most people would not know it existed since it's off the beaten path a bit. You would pass it if it did not know it was there, but dammit I knew it was there. So we walked in and got seated immediately.  In the past I have always gotten their corned beef sandwich or Reuben. Huge portion, but not my favorite corned beef. I opted for the turkey and it was fresh and delicious with same huge portion. They were out of the rye bread that turkey is normally served on and instead the turkey was served on a kasier roll. If I come back, I will order it on a kaiser roll again! It tasted like a slightly less sweet hawaiin king bun. Paired so well with the turkey.  I like the place, love Karl, always have a great time. But...it needs a little updating decorwise; the food and especially the drinks are slightly overpriced...10 bucks for an irish coffee...;and half the sandwiches don't come with a side yet the other half do!???!  Yesterday it was a perfect place for us, especially during the crazy time in Crazyland ( Cleveland)! I reccommend \"accidentally\" walking in for lunch one day!"}
{"text":"Chill, classy, down to earth place to have a quiet breakfast. Karl's a great guy and will take care of you. I'll be back next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Best corn beef and pastrami combo sandwich and the classic is amazing too!!!! Soooo good!! Highly recommend !!!"}
{"text":"Sunday morning breakfast- just like a diner only better. Great place to walk to if staying near Hyatt Regency Arcade or near Casino.  Little hard to find if they don't have sidewalk sign out. Can't see it when looking down 3rd street from a block away.  Casual and clean. Karl cooked up my 2 eggs over easy (very fresh), home fries (slice & dice potatoes with a little crispy around the edges) and ham.  Cool law related things on the wall.  Combination deli, diner, and bar all in one place. !  I would definitely go again.  We were visiting from out of town and just wanted a simple breakfast at a reasonable price. Nice walk through Cleveland Market Square from where we were staying."}
{"text":"Walking around downtown Cleveland on a quiet Saturday afternoon to find decent food can be an exercise in frustration (literally). Happened upon this bar/deli and had a great lunch with excellent service. This place is very old-school downtown watering-hole, with pictures of various Cleveland politicians, famous, not so famous, and possibly infamous - reminds me of Dempsey's here in Columbus. The smaller bar area was full of folks watching the Tribe game.    We had calamari, chicken fingers, pastrami/corned beef, Italian sausage and wings. (We're an eclectic bunch.) The corned beef & pastrami combo sandwich was excellent and I'm a big fan of Cleveland sausage, and this was the place to get it. Our server was super-nice to the kids, but teased them a little bit, too - so typically Cleveland! I'd come here again, for sure."}
{"text":"GREAT PASTRAMI SANDWICH!  After an event at the convention center we walked past Karl's on our way to the parking lot.  It's lunch time-- why not eat here?  Just ordered sandwiches, and were pleased to get gigantic sandwiches!  My pastrami sandwich was nice and warm (on a chilly day) and juicy and flavorful.  LOVED IT!  The server was a very nice lady and made us feel at home in a place we've never been to before.  I look forward to going back to Karl's Inn."}
