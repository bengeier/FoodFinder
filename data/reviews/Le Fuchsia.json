{"text":"Restaurant et bar de l'école d'hôtellerie du collège La Salle. Il faut d'abord le trouver ! Celui-ci se cache au sous-sol du collège. Ambiance calme et tamisée. Le menu gastronomique a peu de choix mais change chaque semaine.  Tout est réalisé par des personnes en formation et la qualité est au rendez-vous. Les plats sont raffinés. Le service est très aimable. Il faut l'avouer, il est aussi un peu lent et parfois maladroit : mais hé ! il faut bien apprendre quelque part !  La réservation est amplement conseillée, car comme c'est un restaurant école ils ne peuvent pas se permettre de servir beaucoup de tables."}
{"text":"I came here for a retirement event for one of my work colleagues.  We were given a choice of a few appetizers, a few entrees, and 2 desserts. I opted for Oysters Rockefeller as my appetizer, grilled swordfish in wasabi butter, sushi rice, and sweet peas as my entree, and black forest cake for dessert. Considering that we were probably around 50 people in our party, I thought that service was fine although I did have to remind the server that I never got my dessert. For our event, we actually \"pre-ordered\" what we wanted so they would have an idea of how much and what to prepare. I was one of three people who showed up to the event ~1 hour into the event so assuming that it took people ~20 minutes to settle in and identify what they selected, I didn't feel that we were too late but this could explain why I didn't really experience any issues with my service/food.  I didn't have any major complaints about the food and it was very good. The minor complaint that I did have about my food was with my Oysters Rockefeller. There was a slight \"sand\" texture which felt like I had bits of sand in my mouth. Not sure of this was actually sand (which I have had in raw oysters which weren't properly cleaned) or something crunchy which was part of the Oysters Rockefeller. A colleague of mine who ordered the black forest cake for dessert had a plastic wrap around it when it arrived at his table  which caught him by surprise (mine was removed before it arrived at my table).  The price was also very good. They accept debit cards, cash, and credit cards. For our large party, they mentioned that they preferred if we brought cash otherwise there would be a long line up to pay (in the event that we all wanted to leave at the same time) but they had no issues accommodating people who paid with their credit cards.  I would have no issues returning here. Not really a solid 5 but I would give them 4.5 which I did bump up to a 5 since I felt that 4 stars doesn't feel right. The menu changes regularly so you might not be able to order the same thing when you return."}
{"text":"The menu changes every week so it's hard to suggest a dish. Your alcoholic beverages will be overpriced for the most part but the food is very well priced.  The food was delicious but a little cold. Your meal price ($10-$15) includes your appetizer, entree and dessert. I was served a Duck Ravioli, nice Beef main, and an absolutely delicious creme brûlée with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream. I would suggest it for lunch if you work in the area, wonderful that the menu changes giving you the change to try many different meals. (choice of 3/wk)  The food and service are by part time staff and the students at LaSalle College work some shifts as part of their coursework. We were \"served\" by the part time staff and it was horrible. Water glasses always empty, forgot one of our desserts, didn't offer pepper for our pastas and were nearly impossibly to flag them down at the end of the meal to ask for tea.  All in all enjoyable, nice decor/ambiance, great food, just need to work on their service.  Food:  10/10 Service:  5/10 Price:  10/10 Atmosphere: 7/10"}
{"text":"Very pleasant experience, good service, great food. $14.95 for 3 courses definitely is a perfect deal. We loved it."}
{"text":"We tried out Le Fuchsia twice recently, and really enjoyed our experience both times. The menu changes each week (according to whatever dishes are being covered by the cooking school that particular week), and in both weeks that we visited, the menus were creative, flavourful, and offered plenty of choices for varying taste preferences. In terms of price-quality ratio, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better option ($15-17 plus tax for three course table d'hotes).  Our favourite dishes were definitely the green thai curry monkfish risotto (an amazing south east asian take on an otherwise Italian classic); the Peruvian style ceviche entree  (bursting with flavour); a sugar-shack inspired take on fried chicken and waffles (but served with an addictive jalapeño jelly); and a quail leg entree that seemed to combine Chinese spice flavors with French cooking techniques. Portions are perfect (you won't leave hungry nor feel uncomfortably full, unless you attack the bread basket, which we often do....), and the flavour profiles of the dishes tend to be sophisticated/classic yet out-of-the-box.   However, note that it closes quite early (orders have to be placed by 7:30 at latest usually), so it isn't suitable for late night dining. Also, while the food offers exceptional value, the wine can sometimes seem a bit over overpriced (at least relative to the great value re: food), depending on the generosity of your waiter's pour - which can be variable. That being said, the manager/director of the restaurant can mix up some pretty great customized and unique cocktails on demand (for about $10), which is always fun.  We've been happy with the service both times (everyone is friendly and helpful, and the manager/director really takes the time to explain each dish on the menu in detail, and makes the effort to provide recommendations re: wine pairings).  Bottom line, it's a great place to go if you're open to trying out new things, and aren't too fussy/particular about small details (while the presentation of the dishes is truly excellent for that price point, garnishes are sometimes a bit wilted - but who really cares as long as the dish tastes amazing, right?)  Moreover, while the atmosphere is arguably much better than other restaurants in that price point (they make efforts with nice lighting etc), don't expect an intimate/high-end setting. The silver lining to that, is that the place easily accommodates large groups."}
