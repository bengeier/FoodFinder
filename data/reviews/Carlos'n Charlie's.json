{"text":"My husband and I came to Vegas for a convention held at the Flamingo and stayed there.  We ate at Carlos and Charlies twice because it was convenient and no long line.  Both times the service was terrible.  The food is mediocre at best.  The first time we had lunch, the dressing on the taco salad was decent, but it took 30 minutes for a taco salad, Carne Asad tacos and a bowl of soup.  They kept leaving the patio door open and we got up to close it multiple times...there was a chilly breeze blowing the whole time.  The second time was breakfast on a Sunday another 30 plus minute wait for 2 breakfast burritos that were very unimpressing."}
{"text":"So I went here for the football game. Let me tell you  these girls were awesome. Gina the manager was amazing! Raquel our server was the best ever. She catered to all of our needs and was amazing! Let me tell you Angie was the best bartender she gave us the best service, best drinks! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely horrible! Service was mediocre. It all tasted like frozen or out of a can - nothing authentic. Spent about $100 on two adult meals, two kids meals, one beer and one frozen margarita. What a waste of time & money. Don't bother going, even the food court was better."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong..I love the Flamingo..but this place is the absolute WORST! I'm pretty sure they use canned dog food for anything chicken related and not even the expensive brand...haha ohh god this place was just horrid! And we even gave it a few chances and it was always an awful experience! They should be embarrassed of their chips/salsa/guacamole...the salsa was definitely poured straight from a jar of salsa they bought at Walmart, and the \"table side guacamole\"?!..might as well just bring your own avocado to chomp on and save yourself $10...another standard Mexican side dish you wouldn't think anyone could mess up..rice and beans! My beans looked like the poop emoji on the iPhone and the rice was a real crapshoot..my fianc√©'s rice randomly had green peas in it? So that was interesting.... And then the service..our waitress had no idea what any drink or lunch specials were...we had to convince her that there even were lunch specials by walking to the front of the restaurant and taking a picture of the display that listed them. The ONLY reason they got one star is because they did at least offer drink and food specials throughout the day (and because yelp makes you give at least one star..haha). But overall, for how much traffic this place gets they really need to step their game up."}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp quesadillas...there was maybe 5 teeny tiny shrimp in each. Might as well of given me empty tortillas. Bartender seemed completely disinterested. Definitely won't come back. A downer. I'd avoid if in Vegas. Nothing happening here."}
{"text":"Food was terrible, over salted, over priced, slow to deliver-- guess visitors to Las Vegas will eat here once-- I'm a local and will never return and will let other locals know to eat at Taco Bell-- it is better and realistically priced.  Chips thick, salsa from a jar, lettuce wilted--- nothing good to say..."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a party spot to hang out on the weekends, this might be a good place for you. I only say that because I was constantly invited to these parties by members of their staff as I walked through the hotel, & because I could hear the music bumping from my hotel room.   If you are looking for a great margarita, this is not the place for you. Their margaritas are a joke & way overpriced for what they are."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here on a Friday night to take a break from gambling at the Flamingo because of the $20 all you can drink until 4 am wristband deal.  You just can't beat that!  It included three flavors of frozen margaritas: regular, strawberry and mango.  I asked the awesome bartender Cory to pour some extra tequila in there for me each time.  I tipped $1 or $2 each time he filled my solo cup and he gave us a fun show throwing bottles around, juggling them and being super nice.  We stayed from 10:30 pm to 1:30 am and it got really hopping around midnight for some interesting people watching. The DJ played really great tunes which got better closer to midnight when it was full on the dance floor.  I cannot speak to the quality of the food, but it's a fun place to go to dance and have some cheap drinks. I didn't want to do shots, but that was an option.  The $20 special did not include beer or any top shelf drinks, but hey, it was well worth what I drank that night."}
{"text":"Good service and tableside guacamole  Food was mediocre. No green chile options. The meat for the tacos was overcooked. Our friend had been to one in Puerto Vallarto . Said the food had been very americanized"}
{"text":"Yikes - How can you screw up fajitas and a margarita.....Ok how about serve the fajitas luke warm with  no rice (that's extra)  you get a plop of refried beans that look like baby diahrea and corn or flower tortillas served in a paper bag that has been heated in a microwave. So the tortillas had crusty hard edges in which we got to put our barley warm chicken.,  Really bad.  Also the margaritas (not frozen) obviously made with a mix sickening sweet no alcohol you needed alcohol to get through this meal.  How can you have a Mexican restaurant and not provide complementary chips and salsa.. This should not be an add on item.  I am local and my husband and I have a date night on the strip every Saturday  Most restaurants in the tourist corridor are good ... sometimes over priced.. but this was the most atrocious dining experience ever,  it was just supposed to be a quick Mexican meal and go home  it was a bummer for sure!.........STAY AWAY.....There are many more dining  options cheaper, better food and better ambience both in the resort corridor and off the strip.  there is not reason to go to this place"}
{"text":"We decided to grab a quick bite here since had never tried it before, we love trying new places and... it was in our hotel and we were hungry.   The restaurant was not busy, it was so quiet you could actually hear the crickets chirping. And dark? Wow! We didn't intentionally sign up for eating in the dark, however some people pay extra for the experience!   The menu is extensive and we ordered an appie to start. Don't do this. The appie was a meal in itself, even shared, and by the time our meals arrived we had to get them 'to go'. It was a waste of money and food.   Note to future self: cold Mexican food at 4 am is not good.  The service was all but non existent, prices are reasonable and Margaritia's overly sweet."}
{"text":"Received a 2-for-1 Margarita coupon and decided to stop in while staying at the Flamingo. Met up with a friend and ordered wings from the appetizers menu; asked the waiter to put the sauce on the side and what do I receive? Wings with sauce on the ... Waiter acted as though he didn't realize that the wings had sauce on it so he took them back and was literally back within 2 minutes with new wings.  Overall, the food was good... However, my waiter's shift ended in the middle of our time there and a new waitress named Christina took over. We asked to split our $31 bill and she didn't properly split it... I was charged $15 and my friend was charged $16. Christina apologized for the error and we were okay with it NOT being a perfect split; we tipped and left. We check our bank accounts today and what's been charged? My friend was charged the entire $31 and I received a small charge for the tip... Wtf?!?! And of course, nobody is answering the phone at Carlos N Charlie's.... Never again.... NEVER!!!"}
{"text":"I had one of the best meals here, it was a chicken dish smothered in cheese on a bed of crispy potatoes. I forgot what it was called but it was great! My wife was semi-disappointed in the shrimp tacos she had, which was bland. We experienced great service until it came time to leave- we waited much too long for our bill and then to cash out. Overall, not bad- similar to an Applebee's in my opinion."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! Family and I decided to eat Mexican food and chose this establishment to have dinner at.  We wanted to see what was their dinner special and they frowned upon that right away.  They brought us warm tap water and semi cold beer. When they brought us our food they just set it on the table and left without saying if there is anything else we need which we did. They never checked up on us to see if we needed another drink. The food seemed like it was canned food. I specifically asked for no onions and it seems like I said add all the onions u have in the back. No one person that I went with enjoyed the experience let alone the food. This is one establishment we will never go to again!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We started here for a bachlorette party and the owner and staff went above and beyond to make the experience a great one! The staff and service was amazing, the food was good and the drinks were excellent! I will definitely be returning. Best service we had while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I had to give a rating but would not even give it one star. Worse place ever. Took forever to get our food. Food was cold and waitress was terrible. Never came back to offer refills or even ask how the meal is. Cold food was taken back and informed did not want another but they still brought it and told to take back.  Near by table had the same issue with food being cold.  Comped the meal but charged for the beverage. Definitely would not recommend this place. Coffee was awful and food quality is very poor."}
{"text":"I hate to \"pile on\" but recently returned from a stay at the Flamingo and sorry to say, these reviews are true. Last year, this place was under construction, and we were pleased to find it finished this year and were excited about trying it out.  We were there on a Saturday night, a bit on the later side, and right away I should have turned and left because the music in the place was just incredibly LOUD.  I'm no fuddy-duddy but to have to lean over and SCREAM to be heard is just not my cup of tea.  My fault there - even the waitress thought it was really loud and asked the DJ to notch it down. We thought the food was good - we had the bean soup, and steak tacos.  But there were none of the usual \"extras\" offered such as crackers for the soup.  We basically had to beg for some carbs!    Prices were a few dollars higher than they should have been.  Many of the items are slightly discounted if you have your players card with you. I thought our server did a decent job.  Clearly she did not have a lot to work with. When we go back next year I will give this place one more try."}
{"text":"Just awful. The chips and salsa came to our table in a sack. The chips were cold and the salsa was not authentic. Tasted like the salsa was poured out of a salsa jar from your local supermarket shelf. Plus we were charged $5.99 for the chips and salsa. We ordered the chicken fajitas,   Just awful.   Refried beans tasted like they were taken from a can. Tortillas came in a white paper bag sleeve.  Chicken were not cooked in traditional grilled fajita method. We were charged $26.00 for those awful items.  If your are expecting to have a nice dining experience, you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"If it were possible to give negative stars I would but then again a \"Star\" is for something positive, so if I could give this poor establishment of a restaurant negative remarks I most definitely would. First off my boyfriend and I went here for dinner around 8:00 pm. Only a handful of people were in the restaurant. Before going in to be seated I snapped a few pics of the rolling stones guys up front. I say that to set up what happened in the end. (Just keep this in mind). We were seated and the waitress came to take our drink orders. I ordered a water and my boyfriend order a raspberry tea. Immediately I get an attitude from our waitress because I ordered a water. (Strike 1) She brings back the drinks and says \"what would you like?\" I'm like \"we need a few more minutes to look over the menu.\"  So she walks away without even saying anything.  She finally comes back after a good 15 min.  When the waitress does come back she decides to sit down and take our ordwers. WTF?!? (Strike 2) I order the Chimichonga and my boyfriend orders the steak tacos. Mean while .... I do not see our waitress again until she beings our food out which was about 30 min. Never came to check on us or refill our cups. Once they bring the meals out I still don't see our waitress. The food tasted old and tasteless. No type of seasoning or any love was thrown into the making of our meals. The tacos hardly had any steak just an abundance of lettuce. My food was just tasteless. I guess I'm just use to Rio Grande back in my hometown of MD. Nothing at this place was fresh.   When we looked about done our waitress came to take our plates and she actually came back with the check right away. But.... why did she just stand there waiting for us to pay instead of going somewhere and tending to whatever else she gets paid to do? I mean who does that?  So I just looked at her and she got the hint. Forgot to mention that some chick came up to us while we were waiting for our order and slaps a hat on my boyfriend and says \"its resturant tradtion\" I was like what? She wanted him to wear a mexican hat and a silly mustashe so she could take a pic. She snaps a few pics and vanished. Dont worry.... towards the end she comes back with the pics asking us if we wanted to buy them. We both declined and she said \"it was worth a try.\" So as soon as we pull our money out here comes our waitress. We give her only a $4.00 tip and she didnt deserve that but we were being nice. We leave out but not before I snap a pic of my boyfriend standing next to the Rolling Stone wax men and the hostess comes running up saying \" Ms. We do not allow people to take pictures with the wax models.\" I was like \"wow, really!?\" Stupid chick unless she wanted to snatch my phone from me what the hell was she going to do about it. Worse food, even worse customer service and horrible staff! STAY AWAY!!!! Go to Margaritaville instead!!"}
{"text":"Horrible food. For 18$ I got fish tacos that were lame, dry fried small piece of fish. One glass of sangria 17$. Other friends got dishes for over 20$ a piece and presentation and amount of food was so cheap looking. I would expect more for the money, service was slow and waiters have to probably run long distance to get to tables. I would not recommend it to anyone and I won't be back. They don't even offer chips and salsa as usual Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast it was pretty good actually. Everything tasted nice and fresh, eggs, hash browns, bacon and pancakes."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!  better Mexican food at the pool area of the Flamingo  a real disappointment  Food  and Margaritas are the worst I ever had."}
{"text":"I spent a couple of days at Flamingo's on the Strip and since Carlos an Charlie's is hard not to notice in the hotel, I went there several times for a drink and a snack. This is not the kind of place you go to for a serious meal, it's a bar with food for god's sake. The gin and tonics were great and there is no way to mess up a beer - bottle or draft. The service was good and the guacamole an chips were just that, but it was a nice touch to have the waiter whip up the guacamole at the table. The place is noisy with numerous TVs conveniently placed throughout the place, but hey it's a bar not a place you go to for a romantic dinner or a first class meal. It is what it is and this is what I liked about this place. Let me add that I have been to other locations of this chain both in the US and Mexico and they are all very similar - decent bar food, a bit pricy, and a good place to park your bod for a few minutes or hours to people watch."}
{"text":"We checked out of hotel and just got a couple Frozen margis to kill some time. They were pretty melted right out of the tap so it didn't really make sense to send it back. It was fairly strong though. The place was filthy and just stunk. There was just trash all over the floors and such behind bar in plain view. We were starving but was no way we were going to even get an app. The bartender was actually fairly entertaining and I appreciated his attitude. My girl thought he looked/acted a little like Jamie Kennedy which I could see I guess. Although he could probably lose the $10 bill from his forehead; little too much flare."}
{"text":"Myself, wife and 2 friends arrived at the Flamingo and checked in at 8.00pm and decided to eat at Carlos and Charlies, as it was convenient and we did not want to travel far - What a mistake........! The restaurant was not busy and the service was still terrible, to start they managed to screw up a simple drinks order, even the beers were wrong ! The waiter then returned with the correct drinks and the beers were only filled up to where we had taken a drink from.....They could not even fill them up and at $17.50 for each beer, I think they are the most expensive on the strip ! Food was trerrible and a poor excuse for Mexican. We originally lived in Austin and this is nothing like Carlos and Charlies at Lake Travis, or they would have been out of business long ago !  Very expensive, poor food and no atmosphere - do yourself a favor and steer clear. There is much better available (almost all is better than this !)."}
{"text":"We stayed at the flamingo hotel, which is awesome, but we were hungry and this place was inside and convenient. Saw all the negative reviews but said what the hell we'll try it. TERRIBLE MISTAKE. This place absolutely sucks. I ordered Tacos for $17.00. I figured it would come with rice and beans, ITS A MEXICAN RESTAURANT. Got 3 tacos, thats it, nothing else. I could have gone to taco bell and got more food. And on top of that, my fiance ordered a cheese quesadilla, the dumbass waiter brought out steak. We told him he had made a mistake but we'll take it anyway because we were hungry. He charged us for steak. But what drove me crazy is the drink prices, my god what a f'n ripoff. I realize its vegas but im not buying a large pitcher for $39.00. And if that waiter still works there, hes a total idiot. Kept on asking why we weren't drinking and was getting annoyed with us. Im assuming its because they get a commission for drink sales. $44 for 3 tacos, a cheese quesadilla, and water. If i could rate no stars i would. THIS PLACE SUCKS, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE."}
{"text":"The drinks were tasty. The quesadilla was a bit light on the meat that was supposed to be in it. The atmosphere was party like and fun but the incessant whistle blowing by the bartenders was grating."}
{"text":"We had a party of 7 at about 730 in the evening this past Sunday not busy maybe at 30% capacity , our drinks took 20 plus minutes to arrive and the server and bartender didnt know what a vegas bomb shot was which we were charged 9 bucks a piece for and they werent even done correctly. The jalapeno marg was just ok should be an infused simple syrup to excrete as much jalapeno flavor as possible not just spice with bits of pepper in it . Our server brought my marg and it was the wrong size ( so had to wait another 15 minutes for the correct size which I ended up having to go up to the bar )  Our food arrived and the reccomended entree(chicken parm) was bland and served with IQF ( individually quick frozen) frozen potatoes DO NOT ORDER the nachos were good but I would recommend layering chips with toppings . The queso and salsa appetizer were amazing though very yummy. The food was really over priced I don't care if it is las Vegas.  The service is what really is why I won't go back. Being a professional in the food service industry I would say dont go to this place and pay $250 dollars and expect amazing food and awesome service"}
{"text":"No deal never again! The food was WAY over priced, no real flavors & the waiter had more important things to do like full around with the hostess. We were there on 3-12-13 for a late lunch, we will NEVER go back its just not any good. We only go to Vegas 3-4 times a year & we for sure know where not to go."}
{"text":"At the prices they charge, you expect a certain standard.  That doesn't mean brown week-old lettuce.  The food quality was awful.  And \"fresh guacamole\"?    I don't think so.   Dreadful."}
{"text":"The frozen margs were great as well as the nachos, but the service was completely unexceptional. We NEVER received a water refill. Never attended to at all unless we flagged down our half dress waitress. I ordered the big mama marg cup as our second round and it was $30 for half of the smaller size, placed into a very deceiving plastic cup. Never again."}
{"text":"Do not eat here!   Service was good but the food is awful.  Rice was cold, dry and crunchy, tacos were made with ingredients not fit for a dog."}
{"text":"The concierge suggested Carlos' n Charlie's as one of a couple of options to take kids for a \"fun\" atmosphere.  I wish I would've checked their reviews first. It's quite expensive for mediocre food and not real clean."}
{"text":"Don't go here.  We ended up here because we got a really good deal off of the Radio Shopping Show.  Read the reviews and decided to stop by anyway. (We were close, at the Linq, family night.) Worst idea.  Our waiter was nice,  felt bad for the guy. The rest of the staff was very unprofessional. Bussers/waiters walking around with their shorts hanging off their butts; waitresses in tank tops with boobs almost falling out. A bartender trying to hit on me on my way to the bathroom.  We ordered mini burgers for the kids, husband ordered a carne asada taco salad,  and I ordered a burrito. The kids food came out first; they enjoyed it.  Then the taco salad, which came out of a prepackaged bag and with chicken on it, not carne asada . Had to send it back. Everyone was halfway into dinner,  and still no burrito.  So I ate one of the mini burgers, which wasn't bad.  Watched my husband eat what looked like the worst meal he ever had....  Still no burrito.  I asked for the check and for my food to go.  Fifteen minutes later we got our check,  and the waiter kindly told us the salad and burrito would both be taken off the check.  I couldn't wait any longer to get out of the place so I told him just to keep it.  No doubt this place needs some serious help.  It wasn't worth my time."}
{"text":"Went there last night before going to a show. We didnt get complimentary salsa and chips like most mexican restaurants. But that wasn't the issue. The prices are high for what you get. Ordered a burrito and it came with dried out refried beans. No lettuce or salsa even.  The burrito was terrible. The rest of the party had tacos and fajitas. No one was crazy about the food. I dont know what was worse - the food or the service. When we were done with the meal the server brought the check without saying anything. Just plopped it down. What if I wanted dessert or coffee? We couldnt wait to get out of there. Seriously, something needs to be done. We will not return."}
{"text":"Party of 8 purchased a Living Social deal for $50 which provided unlimited frozen margaritas and an entree for 4 hours. Staff tried to make us walk to the outside bar every time we needed a drink.  Then the only \"offer\" they had was to move us outside closer to the bar. Waitress was condescending and tried to play interference to try and avoid us talking to management. Don't do it....don't come here!"}
{"text":"I really wish i had seen the poor rating on yelp before we decided to come eat here  the bad:  1.  we saw our waitress 2 times in the 2 hours we were there.  the first time was after sitting for 20 minutes waiting for her to come take our order, and the second time was after waiting 30 minutes after finishing eating to have her bring us the bill.  no checking up to see how the food was, or to fill drinks at all  2.  the charlie burrito tastes like cheeseburger hamburger helper wrapped in a tortilla  3.  there is some stupid lady who comes up behind you and tries to put a hat on your head without any warning or asking.  she almost ended up with my dinner knife in her leg when she just slammed the hat on my head    the good:  1.  the guy who brought out our food brought out the food  2.  the guy who made our guacamole made the guacamole    in reality, there is nothing good about this place and i will not be back"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick dinner before our Legends show and place was pretty empty. We figured it was the day after the 4th of July, so everyone has gone home.. I don't like to jump on the bandwagon, but I just read some of these reviews I feel bad saying this but most are on point. Food was not good. The margaritas weren't bad. The picture guy did come by, but honestly we didn't mind that. It is Vegas and we got a cute picture of the hubby and I. Our waitress was Raquel (hope I spelled her name right) She was totally friendly and funny, so because of her I will give it a 2 star. Wish I could give this place a better review.."}
{"text":"Signs all over the casino saying 'Happy Hour extended until further notice', but our waitress tells us at 6:15 PM that management is not doing it tonight.. ummmm?!  The food is way over priced for average dishes.  The chips for our chips and salsa appetizer came in a paper bag, and when they were gone nobody refilled.  Waitress brought us only two waters when there was three of us, and we had to ask her to bring the missing water.  Took forever to get the bill, refills, anything really.  Very poor service."}
{"text":"Look out for this place,today at so called happy hour they said you can get 2 ,16 oz bud lights for $6 for my mom and sister I  ordered a shock top with out asking how much ,wow,what a mistake that was ,$8.50 for  a so called 16 oz,so here comes the beers in 12 oz plastic cups ,I told the waiter we asked for 16 oz ,and he assured me it was 16,so being a local cab driver I took the cup home to use a measuring cup to verify, yes I was right. I presume these guys are running some kind of shake down and to enrich themselves behind carlos and charlies back.beware!"}
{"text":"The food is okay.  I ate there last night with my girlfriend and four of her friends.  I had the shrimp burrito.  I wasn't spectacular, but it was okay.  It was not worth the $19 I paid for it, but those are Strip prices.  My main reason for the two star rating is their unwillingness to accommodate their customers.  Apparently, they have a policy of not doing separate checks. There were six of us at our table, most of us using credit cards to pay.  The waitress basically said we had to figure out how much each of us owed and she could run each card one at a time, subtracting what we told her from the bill each time.  After ten minutes of trying to figure out the bill and how we would deal with the tax we finally got the manager and complained about the policy.  He ultimately agreed to do it for us and it took another ten minutes to separate everything in their computer with one of the members of our party helping him sort out the bill.  I have worked in three different restaurants in the past, not to mention have eaten in dozens of restaurants here in Vegas and never have I had a restaurant tell me they won't do separate checks.  Las Vegas is a top tourist destination in the entire world.  People come here in groups.  Why on earth would any restaurant have a policy like that in a city like this?  It defies logic and it's extremely inconvenient.  As someone who has waited tables and bartended in the past I do understand how annoying it can be to be asked to split a check for a large group at the end of the meal, but our waitress was asked up front and I didn't even show up until everyone else had finished eating so my check should have been easy to split off.   I was not happy about us having to jerk around with this for twenty minutes when we were ready to leave.  Change your policy, folks."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and because I was craving Mexican food I decided to give it a try anyways. Mistake number one. The outdoor seating has a fun atmosphere, Music playing & misters we're on to keep cool. So that was nice but the food service and quality failed miserably. Guacomole was okay but not for the price. I ordered the chicken flautas. They basically throw them in a fryer (for way to long) so the ends are fried to a crisp and when I finally got past the over crispy  part.... I hit the dried out rough chicken part. They serve you three but I only ate one and half before I realized it wasn't gonna taste any better. The rice wasn't so bad. It was tasteful and fluffy but the canned beans have got to go. Gross!! It was obvious our server didn't want to be there anymore than I did after tasting the food. I figure we tried it and now we know better. We won't be returning to this place again."}
{"text":"If there was a option to give this place a negative star I would. Myself and girlfriend stopped by to grab a late night snack before hitting the strip it was around 10 PM so for Vegas standards still pretty early. The restaurant was already in full club mode with the music cranked but no customers, we were first seated at a booth but the music was so loud we couldn't hear each other so we asked to be seated out on the patio. The waiter said the host would be right with us but that never happened so we headed to the patio since there were other patrons and staff out there just to be stopped by security who told us we weren't allowed to sit outside at this point we dropped the menus on a table and headed out. Just hard to believe they would turn down two paying customers just to make the dining room look busy. The food that people had on the tables looked pretty good."}
{"text":"Its pretty hard to mess up mexican food, but Carlos and Charlies managed to do it.  We ordered and appetizer of guacamole.  However the meal arrived before the appetizer did, so we sent it back and asked for the appetizer to be serve.  The guacamole was actually pretty good.  However it appears that they just took our entrees that they served us before the appetizer and just warmed them back up after 20 minutes.   The ceasars salad was sooggy and the chicken quesidilla was just plain old.   The food is overpriced to begin with so thank god we had a groupon.   If you want a great mexican dinner at a reasonable price go to Mi Casa in the Silverton Hotel!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst experience I've had in quite a long time! I visited their restaurant in Cancun last year and we were treated like royalty..., here, we were treated as if they were doing us a favor. They were not busy yet it took the hostess 5 minutes to seat us. The table was wobbly and the seats were worn out. No drink orders nor were we given napkins and silverware! After 15 mins, a waiter stops and asks us if we'd like a drink. We ordered but 5 mins later, another server came and asked us if we were ready to order. About 10 mins. later our drinks arrive - we did not finish them! Chips and salsa are decent. The food arrived: carne asada burrito and chicken quesadilla with bean/rice. The chicken was overly spicy and dry. The tortilla was soggy and the cheese wasn't completely melted. The burrito was OK but nothing spectacular. Neither of us finished our dinner which cost: $78!! I did not leave a tip which was difficult for me because I have family in the restaurant business.  I would give less than a star if I could."}
{"text":"Came here to eat by myself while staying at the Flamingo. There were probably 4 other tables groups of people in the entire restaurant while I was there, and STILL, the service was unbearably slow. My order was wrong, and cold, and tasted worse than Taco Bell tastes on it's worst day. Consequently I didn't eat more than 3 bites of my dinner because my stomach couldn't take it. My waiter kept forgetting about me. The time between when I sat down and was finally asked my order, was about 15 minutes. The time for my food to arrive was another 20. To get my corrected order took another 10. When I asked for my check, it took another 10 minutes just to bring it over to my table. Do not eat here. Don't waste your money. Go get a taco out of a vending machine and it will taste better than this place."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant negative stars I would.  Absolutely terrible experience.  We came here with a wedding party of 20 people.  It took over 20 min for our drinks to come out and they messed up on two of our food orders.  Then when it came to splitting up the check they would not split them.  We were told that it states on the menu that checks are not to be split (still not sure where that's stated).  We were never notified by the waitress that checks could not be split.  After speaking with the manager they still would still not split them.  This ment many members of the wedding party had to go to the ATM for cash.  I have never been so disappointed in a restaurant and the management.  Having worked in the restaurant industry I am appalled at this establishment!"}
{"text":"Went here on out first night in Vegas...got food poisoning. The music was super loud and the food overpriced. Eating here has nearly ruined my vacation. Don't do it...however drunk you are...go to Senior Frogs instead."}
{"text":"I never write reviews, especially after I've gotten home from my trip, but this restaurant compelled me to. It's horrible. Don't eat here. I should've checked yelp before we did because it is disgusting food and poor service. I mean, I'm sure if you're there just to drink, it's probably fine, but that's where it ends. The enchiladas were VERY bad. Tasted like canned sauce. The rice tasted like the kind you get in a bag from the grocery and microwave. Not even close to being \"authentic\" mexican food. Just a joke. My friends food was half cooked, half wet. Yeah, gross. The Coke machine was flat and when I asked for another, I never got it. We waited 15 minutes and then finally just told them to forget it. Again, DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"I was there last night and I can say that I'm really disappointed. Being one of the best customers of Carlos' n Charlie's in Cancun, I expected the same quality. Sadly it wasn't; the food and the quality of the open bar is so low and cheap that I could only drank a half margarita. And it was all I had for the night. We asked for a refund of the Open Bar  -which they refused-  since we were not willing to drink more of that weird stuff they serve as alcohol. Instead we were offered a \"comp real Bacardi\" which it wasn't enough to make it up for it. We decided to go, I feel robbed."}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant with my girlfriend because we had a Groupon and were on vacation.  Bad choice.  The restaurant feels like the TGI Friday's of Mexican restaurants and is ridiculously expensive for the quality, even for the strip.  Chips & salsa, guacamole, and cheese will cost you quite a bit extra for any meal choice.  Drinks are overpriced.  $4 for an iced tea?  Really?    Our service was terrible.  The waitress was nice up front but then disappeared for a good half hour after taking our order, as people from the kitchen brought out our food and appetizer.  Trying to get her to come back for drink refills was nearly impossible.  Bill for 2 entrees (I got tacos, my girlfriend had a burrito - nothing fancy), an iced tea, chips & queso, and an alcoholic beverage would have been upwards of $70 + gratuity without the groupon.  If the food is going to be way overpriced, it would have been nice if it was at least good, rather than mediocre.    Not worth it."}
{"text":"This place really doesn't even deserve one star, but I guess if they were to get one star it'd be for their half-hearted attempt at providing entertaining service. While I was there with my fiance and in-laws, we were entertained by our bubbly waitress and her ability to keep the atmosphere lighthearted with wit and slap-stick humor. The service started out great and even the guacamole was legit. It was all fun and games until the food arrived. My mother in law ordered a taco salad; the meat looked disgusting on it and surely when everyone started making tacos they started to chew a gamey sort of meat that tasted and smelled foul. We were all really disgusted and grossed out by the meat; my mother in law went into the restroom and vomited. We told the server about it and she did try to get our bill reduced, but $6.50 off the bill didn't assauge our grief, so we literally waited there for over a half hour watching their incompetent staff go through all of the motions to try and deny our request to get the item pulled off of our bill. After being firm and refusing to pay for it they succumbed to our request. At this point, everyone was in such a bad mood and although our server tried her best, we felt the food was way too overpriced to have this kind of thing to be happening.  This place is not inexpensive by any means, and for the price I was expecting top-tier Mexican food. The quesadilla I had reminded me of cafeteria food and though I ate it, I wouldn't have paid $10 for it had I known it would be mediocre at best. In addition, their margaritas were a rip off! $11 for 2 dinky margaritas which I presumed had a splash of alcohol in them at best.  Don't be fooled by this place; they have an ambiance that reaches out and grabs the party-going vacationers that are looking for a good time and rests on the ignorance of passerbys that have no idea of what awful food they're about to get. If this place wasn't so transient, they would no longer be in business!"}
{"text":"Tasteless microwaved-like Mexican food. Just awful. We ordered tacos and they didn't even taste like real food. Not recommended unless you are really starving."}
{"text":"Food was lousy and  extremely over priced.  Service was sub par at best.  Just hope the food doesn't get any of us sick....."}
{"text":"Ridiculous expensive. Cold nachos? When we told our waiter he said they were supposed to be that way. Yuk!  Won't be back here ever!  Talked to the Manager the next day and he barely gave me a 20% off for dinner (which I did not use).  If you are in the 21 group and want to party then this is the place to go. The music is super loud - not good if you want to actually eat. They push their overpriced drinks on you hard. $7 for a little plastic cup of Coors.   This is a nasty place.."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the worst Mexican restaurant on the strip.  Overpriced, small portions, lousy food, and chips/salsa are not included.  Taco Bell has more authentic Mexican food than this place.  The only plus is that, during off hours like mid-afternoon on a weekday, the service is reasonably paced. But still.  The food is really awful.  If you consider Taco Bell good authentic Mexican food, than you might give this place 3 stars (its still overpriced and small portions).  If you expect more quality, then its a one-star-wonder.  Three tiny tacos were $16, and that only included Rice-a-Roni style rice.  Beans were extra??!!  So with a single drink and a tip getting a taco plate with beans will run one person $25.  My suggestion is to keep going.  Anywhere else."}
{"text":"Try their habanero salsa! It's really hot I don't know why this place only has two stars.. I'm only giving them a 5 stars cuz I own a food truck an want them to do well (I know how hard it is) I liked the food and the bartender last Sunday was a huge hit (: we were good an tatered! He got us goin really good and funny too. Good service!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a better review, but because we sat there for 20 minutes with no service, we left. Multiple servers and managers walked by with not one word being said to us. All we wanted was a good lunch outside on a patio and that seemed too difficult for this place to deliver. When we went to leave,  I let the hostess know we received no service and it seemed to not have really mattered. I've been in the food industry as a bartender for 8 years, and this was one of the worst experiences I've had. I know the 20 minutes sounds like an exaggeration because that's what customers do, especially when hungry, but I only knew because we started actually paying attention to the time tick away. I would never ever recommend this place to anyone, in fact I would go out of my way to tell people not to go there. Get it together Carlos, this is Vegas. Step up your game a bit. But then again, because it is Vegas, they don't have to care about one persons review because people will go there no matter what because of the name. Unfortunate for those future customers."}
{"text":"The food was at least okay, however the service was beyond abhorrent. It took 15 minutes to get a simple side of sour cream, by which point the food it was for had gotten cold. Of course in this entire time the refills that were promised 5 min before never bothered to arrive. After getting the refills finally, it took another 25 min to get and pay the bill. All this and the restaurant wasn't even half as busy as what a generic Denney's or whatever would be able to handle.  All this at twice the price of anywhere that knows how to treat people decently."}
{"text":"As others have already noted the service is atrocious and the food is sub-par at best. I ordered the bowl of cheese with chips and chicken fajitas. The bowl of cheese was completely without any flavor and the chips came straight from a bag...a cheap bag at that. The fajitas were ok with plenty of grilled veggies and sufficient chicken...just no real flavor. Service was the worst. At least my server was. I did notice that other tables in my area (but different server) seemed to be getting attentive service. Mine just didn't seem to give a rats...well you get the gist."}
{"text":"So crazy to read the previous reviews about Carlos'n Carlie's. we came here for my 30th birthday weekend and the first night there we went there because we wanted to sit outside eat and drink and smoke. The music was playing and the food was good and the service was AMAZING! We had Peyton as our server and we loved him! To be honest he made my birthday so much more fun! And he took care of us and his customer service is exceptional! I've been in customer service line of work for over 12 years and he is just phenomenal! Thank you Peyton! I can't thank you enough for everything. We loved it so much we went everyday we were there sometimes twice. There was a table behind us one afternoon asking the waiter where Peyton was haha. So we're not the only ones who feel this way. Even better Peyton's twin brother Jason is an employee there and yes!! He is just as great! He was just as attending as Peyton and did everything he could to make sure we had exceptional service! Carlos n Charlie's you guys have gems on your hands! Please recognize these two amazing men! And thank you again guys for the memories!"}
{"text":"Went here last night around 8pm with two tired little boys who just wanted a cheese quesadilla. The children's menu does NOT have Mexican food on it! We had to pay $14 for a cheese quesadilla!   The place was DEAD. The server took over 10 min to even acknowledge us. When the server finally acknowledged us he was S L O W with everything. The food was overpriced. The margaritas were gross. The \"frozen\" margarita wasn't even frozen.   Terrible experience. Never go there. Biggest mistake.   ***edited because I would love to respond to Gaby, but it won't let me. Please message me, if you can."}
{"text":"I only wanted to eat breakfast at a different place during my 6 day stay. Every place I went to was totally the opposite of what I experienced at this place. Service was horrible, food was average, order was wrong when delivered.  Had a concern of why a hot cup of water cost more than Bacon , was asked if I wanted a manager I said yes.  Server returned with bill adjusted by $4. And rudely said   \"this is your bill the Manager has no Explanation\"  And walked away .  Properly attired, was in town to host /dj the 11th annual dance convention so guess who had lots of money?  Flown in from Philadelphia to dj in Vegas last 10 years, 99 problems money ain't 1.  So why did I get blown off? Any guess? Might be my tan.  Spoke with hotel management they emailed but that's not really a solution, people that have tans should stay away our money isn't welcome   New to help should be no stars at all"}
{"text":"Slow service. Salsa tastes like Pace Picante out of a jar. Gross! Definitely not worth the discounted price of $5! Rosarita refried beans out of a can are way better! Rice is bland with a side of funk! Went here on a Wednesday night, so apparently not club night. The tacos are ok, but Del Taco is much better! Everything is overpriced as well... I wish i had checked Yelp before settling on this place. I would rather have gone to bed without dinner and filled up on watered down free drinks in the casino. Trust me when I tell you, if your hungry save your money and go someplace else!"}
{"text":"My friends and I showed up about 8 pm on a Saturday night. Food was decent enough, but a bit over priced. I know it's the strip, but $15 or $16 for a small quesadilla is a bit much. Service was not bad. Staff seemed to be doing their best to make sure the guests had a good time. Our waitress was a little shy, but did a good job serving our rambunctious group."}
{"text":"Should have listened to the reviews,  food sucked-after decided on things because \"the chef won't do that, the chef won't do that\" we ordered and WAITED!!!! Nachos had burnt cheese, and were dry. Ambiance was s plus"}
{"text":"Service terribly slow.  It took 45 minutes to get fish tacos and chicken enchiladas!  People who had arrived after us got served before we did.  The margarita was too sweet.  My fish tacos were really bland. The fish was battered and fried like \"fish and chips\" fish that was chopped up and thrown in a tortilla with some cabbage and chipotle mayo on top."}
{"text":"Arrived just before 6pm on a Wednesday during our stay at the Flamingo, just in time to take advantage of the 2 for 1 margaritas. Food was good and came out fast. I wouldn't call it authentic but was good. Margaritas were kind of typical and a little too sweet.  Was good food and I may go back of I had a good coupon otherwise probably not."}
{"text":"The Fresh Guacamole is the ONLY reason this doesn't get 1 star... Queso was decent.  Service was SLOW, but pleasant when they finally showed up...."}
{"text":"Went right after work to get some drinks.  We ordered 3 beers and some food.  The food took about 20 minutes for a sandwich and they were not busy.  A couple rounds later we were wondering where our server was because he hadn't been to our table for about 30 or more minutes.  He FINALLY came by ad said his shift was ending.  She since we work in service industry we offered to close out with him and ordered another round from the new server.  We never saw our 1st server again.  We waited 20 minutes and asked where our beers were.  He said I will be right back with them...what kind of beers are you drinking again(we had a few empty bottles of the same beer on the table already).  Ordered the same beer again and waited for another 30 minutes.  Finally once we got our beers we closed out.  $95 tab..which is expected for the strip but with THAT service it should have been comped.  We then went to the bar which was a great experience.  So if you want to get decent service go to the bar......but needless to say I don't want to go back."}
{"text":"Not bad for our first place we ate at on our trip. It was seat yourself when we went, lunch and just when happy hour started. Coupons for buy one get one free drinks floated around to all the tables and our waitress was very attentive. We both got tacos, Charlies tacos and chicken tacos would recommend both although Charlies tacos had a little more spice and flavor to them. Great prices for a quick bite don't expect to be waited on hand and foot it's a casual more bar atmosphere. All in all would recommend and if staying at flamingo again, would come back to for a nice quick lunch. I'm giving this place 4 stars, for what it was it was good, not the very best I've ever had but I would recommend if you're walking around the flamingo and want a bite."}
{"text":"I would hate to see this place packed with people. When we came, there were maybe 5 tables full, if that. The service was extremely slow, we waited forever to give our drink order, then forever to order, then forever for the food. It's pricey for the quality of food that they are serving.  The waitress however was super nice. I wouldn't waste your money here, there are to many other options here in Vegas to eat at a place like this."}
{"text":"We ate at Carlos' n Charlie's on our first night in town.  We THOUGHT it would be a good pick because it was in our hotel.    MENU:  Decent.  There were a good amount of items to fill each one of your needs, whether it was chicken, pork, steak, seafood, etc.    PRICE:  Decent.  It wasn't too pricey, considering Las Vegas can REALLY get you on a bill.  SERVICE:  Poor.  This is where it all went south.  It was incredibly dark in the area we were sitting.  The  only light was a string of lights that couldn't attract a moth.  Our server greeted was prompt at first, but then it turned into a test of patience.  Things seemed to take FOREVER!  The place was not busy enough to receive the lack of attention we received.    BOTTOM LINE:  This could have been a higher review had our service been a bit better.  Could it have been just our server?  Potentially!"}
{"text":"Bad service, not true about free drinks on cards, women pay $15 for open bar but men go in free.  However, simple drinks for men are $11 and up."}
{"text":"Been waiting for my appetizers for 15mins to find out the salsa was from El Paso bottled salsa and chips were not fresh. You would expect the first impression  of a Mexican restaurant is their unique salsa not bottled salsa where you can get at Walmart. Then they have the audacity to give the chips in a white bag, since they are so lazy they can't even put it in a basket or plate. Hate to see how the food turns out. Here is hoping!!!"}
{"text":"Crappy food, and terrible service, I've had better at fast food chains, would not recommend this place to my enemy's, it's just awful, rude staff, unpleasant atmosphere, waste of time and money... Hard to think a place like this can survive in Vegas..."}
{"text":"I didnt look at the other reviews before going here, and i still havent.  All i know is i am here and it is absolutely fantastic.  I am outside in the cool breeze, listening to the fountains, drinking frozen margaritas with JJ the bartender, who is fun and who looks like he has the best job in the world.  I ordered the breakfast burrito, sub green chili for red, and it is the best one i have ever had!  If you are at the Flamingo you should try this place before noon!"}
{"text":"Such bland food! The nachos were soggy because they were dripping with refried beans and cheese sauce. Speaking of cheese sauce, why would you have cheese sauce and then melt cheese on top like normal nachos? We added chicken to the nachos, what we received was about a 1/3 of a chicken breast that had no flavor. In addition, the waiter could not understand that we were only there to have a snack and just wanted to share appetizers - so annoying."}
{"text":"Great place right inside the Flamingo.  Feed was excellent  and the service was top shelf.  Payton was our waiter. He was outstanding!  The food and his service exceeded our expectations."}
{"text":"I reserved a party of 45 people and I was a little skeptical at first because of the reviews. But I'm sooo glad we came here! The food was great! All 45 of my guests were very happy. I would recommend this place definitely! All around good food, good service and good music. Good for all ages."}
{"text":"Our waitress was pretty cool, but they didn't even carry Coronas bc it's too expensive. We should have known by the NAME of the place...Carlos & Charlies! I tried to look this place up on Yelp right before we walked in because we weren't too keen on it, but I couldn't get service! Our foolish selves were so starved we didn't feel like walking any further...so we ate there...the other person is right, if you don't know any better about Mexican food, you will like it; but if you do know Mexican food you will be disappointed. Your stomach will regret eating here later :/ This place only survives because it's in the casino and there is heavy foreign traffic who don't know any better (or are severely hungry like er were ) . Never again will I eat here...if this place was in a neighborhood, they would be out of business so fast. Go to HASH HOUSE A GO GO instead!!! ...if you can even read this before you enter"}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends because we heard about their 2 for 1 frozen margaritas. My friends seemed to really enjoy them but I'm not the biggest fan of them so I went for the happy hour bud light instead.   We sat outside to enjoy the beautiful day and enjoy our drinks. We snacked on some appetizers that were overpriced and actually ended up leaving after a while to go eat somewhere with better quality food. Even with happy hour the bill came out to be quite pricey."}
{"text":"I didn't check the reviews before eating here, so I was a little worried once we sat down and started checking out the reviews. We decided to stick around anyway.  The menu wasn't great, it was extremely loud, and the service was incredibly slow. So, I see why people have been disappointed.  Going into it expecting the norm for a restaurant on the strip is going to be over priced, with underwhelming food and service, will help keep this in perspective while dining here."}
{"text":"We always sit outside for Happy Hour. The view is great overlooking the Flamingo garden area.  It's a great place to relax and have a quesadilla or nachos. They add tequila to the frozen drinks and they can sneak up on you. Service is always great. Good people watching too."}
{"text":"Awesome, waiter was super cool and the food was great.  Some authentic dishes and some not so authentic,  Good time, cheap drinks, lotsa fun, que rico."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try this so called great Mexican restaurant. We were very disappointed with the service and food. Drinks took 15 minutes or more and carne asada tacos we tasteless. Meat was full of grizzle, refried beans were dry and tasteless and rice was soggy with a few frozen kind of mixed veggies. Definitely need to get a new meat vendor. Guess no one can compete with Mexican restaurants in  San Diego. I was wishful thinking! No return customers or recommendations here. Very pricey too! (No free chips and salsa?-BadBadBad!)"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Flamingo labor day weekend so it was a no brainer to eat here.  For all the people giving it one and two stars, i am assuming they were expecting way too much out of this place. It's basically a restaurant that specialized in bar food. Mostly Mexican dishes but there are other options. Realistically you're in Vegas, do you want to spend hours in a restaurant? No! You want to get your food quick so you can get back out and enjoy the strip!   We were seated inside but we actually ended up moving outside after we ate. The outside patio is definitely a party atmosphere, where as the inside is a little more reserved.  Our server was very nice and recommenced items to us when we asked what the budget options were!   The prices were all reasonable and the food was good. We will definitely go back here on our trip next year."}
{"text":"Didn't impress me at all. Charged 6.50 for bagged chips and what tasted like pace picante for salsa. I couldn't see or taste the mole on my mole enchiladas and the service was not good either. Would definitely pass on eating here again."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Flamingo and decided to give it a try.  We ordered wings for an appetizer.  They had a good flavor, but were soggy/mushy. When our food came out, 3 of the orders (mole, asada burrito, fries) were all cold.  The fourth order, shrimp tacos, had partly cooked shrimp.  They were still grey!  Whattt????!  Not acceptable."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE EXPERIENCE I HAD! It was great!! We only went for drinks.. we had tons of it... lol and laughed, met other people, had more drinks and the bartender was making nice drinks and he was pretty fast and knew what he was doing! I had no complaints at all :)) I will def be back. I hope next time is great also"}
{"text":"1. Poor Server 2. charged for extra items 3. server delivered wrong bill 4. side order hot wings, cup soup and a small margareta 30.00 Too expensive for what you get!  I'd rather go to Tropical Breeze!"}
{"text":"The food is ok. Nice to have something like this in the flamingo... But the service is horrible. I've been here 4 times & every single time it's been awful. Once I even had to get a new waitress it was so bad. Save your money & your time & go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we didnt have time to check the reviews before we went so we werent prepared for the experience. The \"big mamma\" magarita is a HUGE slushy so dont waste $27. The salsa taste exactly like pace picante sauce and the cheese queso tastes like its straight out of the can. The menu was all over the place with chicken parmesan and quesadillas. The prices seemed a bit high for what it was."}
{"text":"We stopped in on Saturday night, right before it turned into a bar/club. I ordered the Charlie's Tacos (mix of chorizo, carne asada and chicken). They were really flavorful. I enjoyed my meal. My friend ordered the Chicken in Mole Sauce. We both tried each other's and both agreed mine was better. Her chicken had a little too much sauce. She still said it was okay. She mentioned that she got the Parmesan and Swiss Chicken before, and it was really good. We got the two-for-one margaritas with a coupon they were passing out in the casino. My friend got the classic margarita and said it was good, and I got the mango margarita, and it was way too sweet.  They were trying to force a party to start, so that was a little annoying at first, because I was hungry and trying to eat, and they were trying to bribe me to dance (offering free tequila shots if I did the Wobble with them or whatever they were doing.) Looking back, I should have accepted. lol. Oh well.  After we ate, it was fun. People started showing up and drinking and dancing more. They were playing good music. They were training a new shot girl, and so we got a bunch of free shots because they were showing her how to count pours and how to be more flirty and fun with the customers. That was cool.  We ended up leaving and heading elsewhere on The Strip. But it seemed like it would be a good time if you stayed all night. Apparently, it's all you can drink for the ladies after you pay $13 for your first drink. I'd come back again and check that out."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast while staying at the Flamingo. BIG MISTAKE. ordered the Charlies Breakfast Burrito. Potatoes were great, but something was \"off\" with the meat in the burrito. I should have listened to my gut. I was SICK the next day and a half!"}
{"text":"It really wasn't that bad. Looking at other reviews, it almost makes me wonder if I should have checked for a hair in my food or something.  After a night of Saturday drinking, my Sunday breakfast burrito definitely hit the spot. I will say, there wasn't a lot of breakfast/brunch options but then again, they probably didn't open to serve brunch.  The patio was a great place on a beautiful, sunny Sunday. The service was a-ok, but our waiter was servicing a lot of tables. The patio is like a wooden deck and the table next to us had a toddler that spilled some food or something underneath him. When they left, the manager was mopping or brushing it or something and just brushing it into the cracks to go underneath the deck. Ew. God forbid you ever lose something in the cracks, I would say goodbye to it forever!!"}
{"text":"Ok...This may not be fair. My wife and I went here for breakfast.  This place is probably not known for its breakfast but if you advertise it then at least do something right. The service was lacking to say the least. The table was dirty. My coffee cup was dirty and disgusting.  My wife's pineapple juice was watered down and not even close to tasting like it should. The coffee tasted like burnt mop water. Perhaps the dinner or evening atmosphere is better. I don't know. The food was simply ok but not good enough to redeem the other issues. We have all been to dives where the food can make up for a bad experience. Not here.   As a note the manager was apologetic and took the beverages off or bill and also applied a discount with being asked for that extra step."}
{"text":"We ended up at this place because everyone in our group was starving and they could get us in quickly. We should have looked elsewhere.  The vibe of this place is like WTF? It has mostly Mexican food items and a tacky Bennigans like decor. There were all kinds of random dusty nicknacks hanging from the ceiling.   It was about 7:00 PM with a DJ blasting music in a dark room with weird lights everywhere. I think they keep it dark so you can't see what you are eating. The whole vibe was weird and the place was nearly empty.   While the waiter put in the correct order, the kitchen made 2 extra (wrong) meals instead of what my friend actually ordered.   I ordered a $17 burrito  for two people to share (paid $25 with tax and tip) and it was really nasty. I felt sick immediately after eating it.  This place should really be on Bar Reacue, cuz it needs help! The only reason I gave more than one star is because our waiter was very friendly and helpful. He was really great."}
{"text":"Margaritas suck, but it is an entertaining place. you can do better in vegas."}
{"text":"Not bad for me! Visited during Happy Hour (it was a Thursday afternoon around 4 pm) to take advantage of the 2 for 1 margaritas. Ordered 4 margaritas (3 passion fruit and one regular- server said passion fruit was the best) for our group of 5, as well as chips/ salsa and the banana chimichangas (recommended by our server). That's right, no free chips 'n' salsa here folks. I didn't eat the salsa but the banana chimichangas were awesome, and the portion size was definitely large enough to share. Margarita was good- I agree the passion fruit one's the thing, and with the buy one get one it's a good deal!  Atmosphere... kinda TGI Fridays I guess? Makes more sense when you know they are owned by the same company as Senor Frog's. We really liked our server... a youngish woman that wore a flower in her hair... don't remember her name."}
{"text":"Came here with a nostalgiac mindset. I've spent quite a bit of time in CNC's while working in the Caribbean. While this does not compare, it's still a good time. It reminds me of a Mexican themed SaddleRanch. Worth a visit.  Had an order of guac, and cheese dip. Both were pretty good. Also had margeritas at happy hour. If not for the HH pricing, it would have seemed to pricey for what you're getting. But there's definitely a quality for having outdoor space to hang out at during the evening."}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone's giving this place such bad reviews. I sat at the bar and had a great time the bartenders are really friendly and food came out quick.... Yes food was mediocre. . But it was the experience that will keep me coming back.! Mmm maybe more people should sit at the bar then tables ;)"}
{"text":"Salsa is pace picante sauce, not fresh and chips are  not any better. Food is mediocre at best. They try to high pressure sell raffle tickets while you are trying to relax. Go anywhere else, especially for the price which is about $20 bucks or more for what tastes like store frozen foods reheated."}
{"text":"Carlos'n Charlie's is located inside the Flamingo Casino. I thought it would be a nice place to take care of some Mexican food cravings, and I was..... almost right.  The food served here was average. Not too flavorful, but the food took around 15-20 minutes to come out and we didn't even order much. The drinks were pretty decent. I like the margaritas.  The service was quite slow. It wasn't even busy and it was hard to flag down a server for the check and had to flag them down to get some refills.  It was a little dark inside the restaurant. They were handing out Happy Hour deals and BOGO deals to try and entice people to come into the restaurant. Not bad, you are getting a discount... but I'm not so sure if I would come here again."}
{"text":"Nope.  Nope.  Nope.   Came here with the family on a Friday night. First mistake. Loud, drunk obnoxious broads  dancing (read: screaming, jumping, arms flailing and WOOOOOOOOOO!). The lady who did the balloon animals was sweet, my toddler was happy with her balloon animal.   Service not only sucked but blew at the same time. Took forever for the food to arrive and when it did, it was cold. 3 regular entrees and 2 specials off the menu (8.99 ea) total bill ran us about $100."}
{"text":"This place is pretty delicious. My husband and I both got the breakfast burrito that was yummy, but the potatoes are amazing! The food portions are pretty good too (even though the burritos look a little small they were actually super filling!) Only downside was the service seemed quite slow, but the staff seemed friendly. It's convenient considering all the other places we walked by had a huge line and this place didn't have a wait to get in. Not too shabby."}
{"text":"It was ok i guess....the waitress took FOREVER to come to our table to take a simple drink ordee....the host gave my 6 year old a adult menu when they have kids menus....i had to ask for a kids menu....food was not that great for the prices..rice was hard and beans were bland..the only thing tasty was the chimichanga...dont think i will go back."}
{"text":"Omg- best experience ever!! Roberto was amazing! Highly recommend!! The Tableside guacamole is amazing!!! Quesadillas are soooo good!  Great Mexican for decent prices!"}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: hotel Mexican food.  Carlos' n Charlie's is what you'd expect from a Mexican restaurant in a Vegas hotel, but whatever. It's full of drunk people, including yourself. Food is overpriced and everything is an add-on. My Chimichanga was $16, but I really enjoyed it. I couldn't tell you if it was actually good or if I was just starving getting off the 4-hour plane ride (the latter, most likely). Go if you must, don't if you dont."}
{"text":"This restaurant takes the classic TGI Fridays concept of nailing random shXt to the wall and hanging more from the ceiling to a whole new level. The randomness is truly awesome, including a massive cow wearing pink cowboy boots hanging above the bar. I don't know what it means. I don't think anyone knows what it means. But, it's there's and those that notice it, get to wonder why!?  As for the food, it is unseasoned, uninspired, and boring, boring, boring. Two for one frozen margaritas from a machine, on the other hand, where pretty darn tasty.   So, I'd come in during happy hour, skip the other three people who will be there even though the place easily seats over one hundred, and stare in wonderment at the random paraphernalia. It's worth a star in my as yet undefined Yelp review scale from dreadful to awesome."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Sat on the patio and it was a really cool atmosphere. Watched the bartender flip around drinks and cups for a lot of the time....very entertaining. Just to give you an idea on the prices: the burger was $12.99 (and was delicious)."}
{"text":"Boxed Mexican food...  If you are craving the pre-made salsa sold at grocery stores, this is the right place. You can get chips and salsa for $6.  The food is meh, the back patio is relaxing next to the flamingo hotel water flow.  Generally besides a cure for a hangover, I wouldn't be found at this place anymore."}
{"text":"I absolute love this place!!!! So much fun! Order the fish ceviche!!! The servers there are all so fun! Bring your casual clothes. They have outdoor seating with bartenders and squirt guns along with the best manager ever jordy!  There's dancing and probably the best restaurant party environment I've ever been to. I really enjoyed every minute here. Ask for the barber chair, but be prepared to take not only a shot, but if you can handle it they will pour the entire bottle in your mouth and spin you on the chair. All and all the best place ever! I would go back just for the fun atmospheric environment these guys provide!!! Highly recommended for children too. They make cater to kids with balloon animals along with the entertainment of dancing the conga line or the shuffle. It truly is a blast! A must when visiting Vegas l. The prices of the food is reasonable. Not expensive at all!  Don't forget to ask for the barber chair (21+) only!!!"}
{"text":"Guac and salsa were great!  Would also recommend the fish or Charlie's tacos. Don't get the frozen drinks- not enough alcohol. Good place to chill for lunch!"}
{"text":"Horrible food and service. Waffles were soggy. Omelettes didn't taste good either. Not worth the time and overpriced."}
{"text":"This place is the worst hands down. Don't bother just don't. The \"Mexican grill\" doesn't get anymore white washed.. And this is coming from a white girl! The margaritas are shit and so is the food.. Just keep walking. Not worth your money. It lives up to it's star and half. Let me put it this way.. I wouldn't feed this food to my dog."}
{"text":"We ate here a few times because it was in our hotel.  What I loved: The ceviche and table side guacamole were wonderful!!! I will dream of the ceviche it was that good.    The patio is also wonderful in the summer...great misting system and shade.  What was not good: service.  Our waitress the 2nd day (Sunday) acted like we were bothering here when we asked her questions, rushed us (at one point she walked away while we were in the middle of ordering because we couldn't decide on what marg we wanted).  The happy hour margaritas are just slushy sweet juice."}
{"text":"I went with my girlfriend and another friend a few days ago.  I'd never been, but not sure I'd go back.    We went because my friend was staying at the Flamingo, so it was conveniently located.  Food was overall good, though a bit pricey: $17 for 3 carne asada tacos.  $1.90 for a small container of guacamole seemed high, too.  It looked like less than an ounce.  Tropical atmosphere was kind of cool outside (thankfully it was nice outside).  Biggest issue I had was with service.  Our waitress didn't seem that friendly, and when we finally got our food, we still didn't have any silverware.  She brought 2 and had to get a 3rd, but it's just a detail like that that's annoying.    Just wasn't impressed by the place.  Food was the best part, but definitely not my first choice on the Strip.  I'd probably try something new next time I eat at the Flamingo."}
{"text":"Should have read the reviews first...had steak & eggs breakfast...the food was mostly inedible.  How do you screw up breakfast? Over cooked eggs, thin horrible steak, and frozen potatos...all for the bargin price of $16.  I would be ashamed to serve that in my house.   The only thing edible was the toast. Even the coffee was weak.  Worse we waited over 30 min for this...ugh....  Worst of all the coffee cups were not clean..blah...after seeing that I could not even think of drinking my water...I was seriously sick to my stomach for several hours after knowing that the dishes were that dirty."}
{"text":"Our dinner was the chimi, it had canned cheese.and was tasteless The guacamole was fresh and really very nice, made at the table."}
{"text":"We went to this establishment yesterday and the food was horrible. It tasted worse than a pre frozen food meal. We were all so disappointed as we were hungry after walking all day on the stripe and shopping. To make matters worse the service was equally as bad as the food. I will never ever come back to this place even if it were the last restaurant standing I'd rather make my own food. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Well, I wish this chain Was better, being one of the main restaurants at Flamingo with a great patio. It was horrible right off the bat.   Came here on a Monday to kill a little time before our flight out. There was one server for the entire patio, which was steadily busy. I was a server for 5 years; I know, even a great server, cannot take care of 12+  tables and give adequate service. We were not greeted promptly, waited forever for drinks and even more foreverer (?!) for our food.  My comrades and I had beef enchiladas, Chicken tacos, and chicken sandwich. I don't think a single plate at our table was even half gone; food was just bad. No free chips and salsa like the good ole Mexican restaurants. Bland. Fatty and questionable meat. Ugh! Then we waited a while to get  out checks and eventually get out of there.   Save yourself time and a happy belly to go anywhere else:: even the buffet, tropical cafe, or pizza joint at the Flamingo."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my wife choose this joint based on a discount we had. Being homesick from Texas we were craving some street tacos. Jess got the Carne Asada on Flour and they seemed ok.. wait wait let me back up a bit.  We ordered drinks which were mediocre Jess a frozen margarita and I a mojito along with chips and salsa. Frozen margarita was as expected not amazing, mojito was not muttled at all, whole mint leaves etc., and light on the tequila. The salsa was fire roasted northern Cali sweet salsa style, slightly bland; chips were thick fresh and very good. Meaning they tasted like corn tortilla chips should, thick cut, not oily and the oil they were cooked in was obviously clean and not overheated or burnt. Food arrived quickly but the first thing I noticed was the \"Charlie's\" (mixed chicken, carne and Chorizo) I ordered we're on single corn tortillas. Tip: any street tacos worth eating on corn will have to be doubled to hold together because they aren't as pliable as flour. These didn't fall apart but the meat was minced, each meat was unrecognizable from the other. I thought it may all be the same and certainly all had the exact same flavor. Biggest issue was my first bit was similar to a chalky over cooked minced meat. Very over cooked. I liberally applied the hot sauce provided with the dish. It didn't help the dryness at all. I then addressed the beans and rice, mine was Charro style beans and white rice. The white rice was long grain but sticky like sushi rice and had dried out corn carrots and Lima beans in it. The chart beans were cooked well but no flavor or spice at all.  Mixed together with the hot sauce it was ok. After two bites of the bean and rice mix and two bites out of 1 of the 3 tacos I was unwilling to accept this. Jess doesn't complain and was hungry so she ate a few more bites yet confirmed my assessment.   So Roberto our waiter was very polite and attentive, I explained the issue when he came by and he took the plate offering me a replacement, I de lined and just said I didn't want another dish if it was going to be the same quality, he apologized. The manager came through shortly later not to address my concern but to retrieve Jess's plate. I wasn't going to go any further but he saw she only ate half and being we were not typical drunk or wasted Vegas visitors his face shown of his embarrassment. I explained as I did Roberto and he replied the corporate chef was here and he had just addressed the \"dryness\" of the Charlie's tacos. He politely dismissed the rice stating it was show they served the dish, (sticky). I picked at a piece of Jess's and a large skin from the outside picked up attached. I also pointed out the dried out veggies in the rice. They should revisit the white rice. In the end we ordered a second round of drinks and Jess let Roberto know we hadn't gotten the Guacamole she ordered with her tacos. He again was very polite and said all the good was comped, I didn't request this but it's the right thing to do. I retired for a Father's Day call with Abby, Isa and Analeigh. Jess said they were very polite so if there is a saving grace I suppose it's that the managers and severs at this location are top notch with customer service. I will also say that we were maybe an hour after lunch rush and perhaps we got the scraps!? Regardless any meat like carne or chicken and pork chorizo that's minced is gonna dry out!!!"}
{"text":"Would give this place less than one star if I could. The food isn't authentic, processed and OVERPRICED!!! Never again....terrrrrrible. Save your time and money..."}
{"text":"Rating actually -2 stars. Two visits same result really slow service., wrong drinks twice served and the food was just not good at all. Only went 2nd time because friends wanted to sit outside I warned them they didn't listen now they believe me. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Wow, looks like everyone had the same experience I did.  Over priced bland food, no chips (unless you pay extra I guess), $2 for a tiny thing of guacamole.  Food was cold when it arrived and there were only about four tables - and it was during the afternoon.  Don't go here, it's a waste of money."}
{"text":"About the worst Mexican-inspired food ever. Don't know why I tried it, but I ordered the chicken mole, and literally choked on the seasoning in every bite. It's just not made with love, or any decent recipe. My husband ordered shrimp tacos, and the shrimp was deep fried. I didn't see that coming!"}
{"text":"I'm sad this place has such bad reviews.  We came here for the two for one frozen margaritas.  What a good value on the strip.  The bartenders were so much fun and it was such a good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I honestly cannot do better than this writing. It was absolutely the worst Food I've had. I've had good Mexican food on the Strip but this was really bad. I'm struggling between 1 and 2 Stars. I will be generous because of the location and the fact that they did serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Great place and atmosphere! Very friendly staff and yummy food! i highly recommend for tourist from out of town visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. The food was expensive and tasteless and big name Casinos shouldn't allow such bad restaurants in them. I trusted the 'name' of Carlos n Charlie's but wish I had read the reviews before wasting my time and money. They even charge $5 for chips and salsa, which we didn't get and our lunch still cost $43, insane!"}
{"text":"This place just gives off a \"Meh\" vibe. On the bright side, it is located inside the Flamingo and you can get relatively inexpensive food and drinks. On the downside, the quality of products and service match the price point, so it isn't much of a bargain. I've been here for both the food and the nightlife, so I'll cover both separately.     Food: Pretty mediocre bar & grille food but at a very reasonable [Vegas] price. I paid (thanks to losing card roulette) for 4 people, including a few drinks and tip, and it was right at $100. I had a grilled chicken sandwich, and I don't remember anyone being overly impressed with their food.     Nightlife: We were passing by just after 1am on a Thursday and they were clearly having a party. Dark flashing lights, club music, and the place looked packed through the small window opening. The promoters out front tried to rope us in for the open bar, which lasted until 3. We wanted to go in and scope out the scene, but somehow the promoter convinced us we didn't need to do that. After a bit of price negotiation, we decided to go in around 1:30. They poured plenty of strong drinks (if you tip well), but they closed the bar at 2:30, not 3am, so we really only got 2-3 drinks for the $15 plus some obnoxious tips to get service. The place wasn't overly crowded, but they had select sections closed off so it seemed much busier than it really was.     I'd like to tell you that I won't be back, but in Vegas if you can get an edible meal and an open bar for $40 per person, you take it."}
{"text":"We stopped by to kill time. The over priced menu is what i expected on the strip. the quality was less than you'd find in a strip mall. Do yourself a favor and pick any place out on the Linq or farther down the strip."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my birthday, despite the previous reviews I actually like this place. It has outdoor eating and a it's is very nice. The service was very professional. They gave me a free birthday shot. Thanks for the hospitality"}
{"text":"We came to grab a quick bite. Their menu prices were double what the same dish cost on the \"specials\". For about $8.50-10 per dish, I'd say we got a pretty good deal. I had chicken quesadillas and my husband a Caesar chicken wrap. The food seemed just barely cooked to order but tasted okay (everything seemed pre-made just finished in a salamander for temperature). Overall - good experience. We did not order alcohol based on the terrible reviews."}
{"text":"I got two Groupons and came here with my girlfriend to hang at the bar before a show. We ordered two GIANT pints of Dos Equis beer and guacamole. They prepare the guacamole fresh at your table. It was excellent. As a local, I know never to order frozen margaritas or daiquiris or what have you because they contain mostly sugar and hardly any booze. I recommend you get a beer instead. Besides, if you order a huge beer you don't have to worry about them coming by to refill it. I   would come back just to hang at the bar but probably not for the food since it gets such bad reviews. Not only that, but who orders Mexican food on the strip when there are amazing places that locals go to? Do your research, people!  Be prepared for loud music and the staff dancing on the bar and what not because it happens every night.  Friendly bartenders and staff!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend & glad i listened cause their frozen margaritas & mountain of nachos was EVERYTHING and more! We went on Thursday afternoon to catch the football game & the vibes on the patio was much fun!   We ended up coming back the next night and the DJ was SO GOOD! All hits across genres and eras!  Also, shoutout to Gordo for serving up the best guac with a side of humor! I appreciate places where the managers aren't afraid to get down n dirty!"}
{"text":"Ugh. Terrible service here. Took forever to get a drink and then even longer to get the bill. SO much for a quick stop.  We stayed at the flamingo (which I will never do again) and they were hustling us the whole time for drinks here."}
{"text":"Came out of a show hungry it wasn't crowed on the patio so seemed like a good place who could mess up Mexican food.  Worst over priced dinner I have ever had. Canned beans chicken was tasteless and dry. My friends order was dry meat with awful sauce. TERRIBLE so bad I couldn't eat my food."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here since it was in the hotel and we were hungry after the flight. I love Mexican food, I could eat it every day for the rest of my life :) This was ok, I have had better, but overall it was pretty good. Portion sizes were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Holy no staff on Cinco de Mayo Batman. Huge wait outside so I took the bar. 30 minutes before chips and salsa came out. Really frustrating because they had a huge lineup of people and a ton of empty tables. How is a Mexican restaurant short staffed on Cinco de Mayo?"}
{"text":"We were tired and didn't want to leave our hotel. Mistake number one. We forgot to check this place on yelp. Mistake number two. We convinced ourselves it was cool to pay $6 for chips and salsa cuz it was Vegas. Mistake number three.   If there is a law about misleading people into buying canned crushed tomatoes under the guise that they will receive salsa, then somebody at Carlos and Charlie's is in big trouble. I don't know what brand canned tomatoes we received but it wasn't good. That much I'm sure of.   Interesting choice on the presentation of chips, btw. I don't know who came up with the paper bag, with a staple in it, placed on a plate idea but I hope they were immediately promoted cuz that is innovation!  I would like to take a second to compliment the \"chef\" on the unique ability to overcook something while still managing to serve it cold. The fries were rock solid and slightly burnt yet cold all at once. No easy feat.  The beans were, I believed also from a can, but my Mexican friend took offense to that thought because as he explained it, even canned beans wouldn't be that dry. They were old he assured me. Probably sat out all day before making their way to me. Very appetizing.  I hated the rice but one person at my table liked it. Chimichanga was pretty terrible and McDonald's most definitely makes a better hamburger.  The prices are inflated but it's Vegas so it is to be expected but when we are paying $8 for two sodas, a single refill at any point during the 30 minutes the glasses sat empty would have been a nice bone thrown our way. Incidentally, my one star is for Pepsi. The beverages were far and away the highlight of this meal.  If you are smarter than we were and you've taken the time to check yelp, walk (or run) to a different hotel to eat. Trust me!"}
{"text":"Paid $166 for the worst Super Bowl Party.  Buffet was tiny and all fried food!!  Servers were great their only redeeming factor. Not impressed!"}
{"text":"Not a ton of options at the flamingo in the early evening.  Service was lackluster. We decided to get the 2 for 1 frozen margaritas. Basically they were just slurpees with virtually no alcohol in them.  We think The lime margarita was mixed incorrectly as it was incredibly tart and very icy- like too much ice not enough liquid. The lime was virtually in drinkable.  The mango and the strawberry were decent. Nothing I'd go back for though.  Their beer selection consists of roughly 4 beers ( or the waitress didn't know enough about other options) that was disappointing.  Ordered the chicken quesadilla. Tasty snack. The sides that came with it had been sitting out for a while... Sour cream was watery and the cabbage/coleslaw mixture has been sitting out in the heat....it was turning sour. Kinda icky. Overall this was a 'meh' experience."}
{"text":"Food only ok. Music way too loud. Waiter rude when asked if it could be turned down. Manager said he would turn it down so when we shouted at each other we could hear some of the time. Just wanted to leave so we could exit to the relative quiet of the casino. If you know Las Vegas casinos, that will give you an idea of the volume. This is not the place if you want conversation over good food."}
{"text":"Came in with a party of 7. We ordered margaritas and entrees. First off, the margaritas were warm. Secondly, the food was sub-par. The nachos we could have made at home, the tacos came out cold and the rest of the food was only okay. The worst part of all is that the total came to $225. Nothing memorable about this place. There is a reason it only has two stars. Please listen to all the other bad reviews. They know what they're taking about."}
{"text":"This place is located inside of the Flamingo. I am a betting man and I bet in a year or less this place will close. The drinks and the food are terrible. I wish I had lost my money gambling. If Yelp offered a 1/4 star I would have checked it. Go to Margaritaville you will get fantastic potent drinks and great  food. Adios Carlos and Charlie's. Never ever again!"}
{"text":"To sum it up: terrible Mexican food, small portions, weak drinks, too expensive, loud, slow to get your food, crowded, and they don't give you chips and salsa unless you buy it.  First off, this place was way loud. We thought it was a Mexican restaurant but it was a Mexican sports bar. The food wasn't great at all. My husband enjoyed his but my beans were weird and my enchiladas too spicy and tasteless. Rice was tasteless too. My meal was 17$ for three crappy enchiladas and rice and beans! That's ridiculous! We ordered a $12 quesadilla and it was small and cut into four pieces. Delicious...but for $12!? To top it of they don't even serve chips and salsa as a compliment, you have to pay $5 for them! The drinks were $10 a pop and while what we had was delicious it was ridiculously weak. I'm a lightweight and I didn't get a buzz. The service was extremely slow, but our server was nice and polite, although forgetful. I think he was busy because it seemed crowded and probably understaffed. Ended up spending $100 we regret. Definitely don't go here!"}
{"text":"The wait staff was decent, but everything else made this place not worth it. Pricey for very subpar Americanized Mexican. I ordered a medium margarita with my meal and it wasn't worth finishing (I usually would never waste tequila!). Tasted like a bad slurpee, no alcohol but $15. Go get a yard stick at Fat Tuesday instead. Not a single person i dined with finished there food it wasn't worth finishing. I wouldn't say the wait staff was amazing or overly attentive, but they did their jobs. Skip this place, find some real Mexican."}
{"text":"We went to Carlos and Charlies on our last day in Las Vegas. I got there in time for breakfast right before they switched to lunch. I ordered the Mexican Omelette with came with salsa, chorizo, cheese, etc. I ordered the omelette without tomatoes and onions and with a side of potatoes. The waitress brought out my food and it came with beans - so i ordered a side of potatoes. I then went to eat it and realized it was loaded with tomatoes and onions. The restaurant wasn't busy, so I find this frustrating. Because at this point, they were no longer serving breakfast.   It was okay overall and I ate most of. My friends weren't the biggest fans of their burritos, but they said it was \"okay.\" They only ate half of them. It was a very expensive brunch and we ended up spending about $35 a piece with tip. This did include a $5 bloody mary which was really good. That was the highlight of the meal!  I'd recommend checking out a different place while in Vegas. Sorry Carlos and Charlies, not for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try new restaurant and we ordered chicken chimichanga. It was didn't taste good at all, it was so bland and and the the service was very slow...! The waitress hardly came around...! Nahhhh!"}
{"text":"As I'm sitting here in Carlos & Charlie's we've been sitting here waiting for the check for 10 minutes. & there's only 3 other parties dining here. Also, the fish tacos were the frozen patty kind. My burrito charlie was delicious but that's about it."}
{"text":"Horrible. Gross food. Worse service. Disgusting drinks. This was my second time here. The first time we came, we got dinner. It was awful. This time, I got sucked in by a buy one get one coupon. How bad could just drinks possibly be, I thought? This was by far the worst margarita I have ever had. And I'm Mexican. The bartender acted like he was doing me a favor, dispensing the putrid concoction from the decrepit Taylor machine... Never again."}
{"text":"Carlos & Charlie's is in a great location in the Flamingo Hotel and Casino.  As a Happy Hour it offers 2 for 1 Margaritas (3 flavors).  We got our Margaritas and enjoyed them as we viewed the animals in the outdoor nature area of the Flamingo."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for lunch. It was truly disappointing. My fiancee ordered a Mexican burger. When it came, she noted that it was missing guacamole and pico de gallo. We asked the waitress and she said it comes with a pickle. She didn't seem to know what the Mexican burger was supposed to have on it. After we showed her on the menu, she finally took it back and they added the guac and pico de gallo. My wet chicken burrito was mostly tasteless and the chicken was diced and mushy. Considering the price ($17), the burrito was small, not very good and the scoop of rice and refried beans inadequate. They didn't even serve chips and salsa. I think Carlos n' Charlie's relies on customers being too drunk to care about the taste or quantity of the food. All in all, you would be better served going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went to Carlos 'n Charlies for Friday night drinks before going out. The patio was PACKED to capacity (probably 300-400 people) and the bar was staffed with TWO bartenders. Friends of mine waited 50 minutes to get service, I wasn't able to get anything from their bar. Their bar definitely has the capacity for 12-15 servers, I'm not sure why their management routinely understaffs the bar..."}
{"text":"Food was horrible. Should've listened to the reviews on here. The food took forever to come out and when it did it was like warm. The meal was sad"}
{"text":"SO-CAL RESIDENTS BEWARE (or any decent human being): NO nachos and salsa served AT ALL before meals, if you order Fajitas , that's all you get is Meat. Want cheese? Your paying for it. Want guac? Your paying for it. Want tortillas with your fajitas? YOUR PAYING FOR IT. Nothing is included with your meal unless you \"add it\" for a 1.99 price.  My wife and I paid 78.99 for 2 dinner plates and 2 margaritas. Why? This restaurant has no authentic flavor we have come to expect from our so-cal restaurants. This place has simply taken the opportunity of being in a casino to charge 20 dollars for a burrito.  Try Pink Taco in the Hard Rock instead if you want legit flavor and fair prices."}
{"text":"Very seldom do I eat somewhere without checking  Yelp first but that won't happen again! This place is just nasty! Dirty, dingy, slow service, gross food. Just ick!"}
{"text":"A group of us purchased LivingSocial vouchers for an entree and all you can drink beer or margaritas for 4 hours.  When we asked which menu items were included, the first server said anything on the menu was included.  He left and the second server started taking our orders and told us some of the items we were ordering were not included.  When it came to pay for some of the meals that weren't covered by the voucher, the server charged us for one too many.  When we protested, she refused to go back to check her records.  The only saving grace was the bartender who poured extra tequila into our frozen margaritas.  It was a good thing that we were with fun friends since that deterred us away from the server with the poor attitude."}
{"text":"Hey it was nothing great but the price was right.  The wife and I stopped in here our last night in Vegas. They were generous with the drinks, giving out a ton of free shots, but the quality of the alcohol is somewhat suspect with me. My gin and tonic tasted like rubbing alcohol and the whiskey sour was very sweet, too sweet. But every bartender makes drinks a bit different.  On the topic of bartenders, the younger guy and girl that were serving were very friendly and even helped me get open bar price (it was an open bar for ladies night). Service was great.  The bar also had an actual dj playing the music which is always a plus.  Overall alcohol was not great, but it was a good time and we would consider going here again if we stayed in the flamingo again.  To all the people going here to eat, what were you thinking?!?"}
{"text":"I've been here three times. The first two times I had nachos which were ok. This third time we had a real meal and it was not good. The carne asada tacos tasted like I was eating a beef dip sandwich in a tortilla. The service was slow and I only counted 5 tables with people and 3 servers. Bummer. I like a good Mexican place and Carlos and Charlie's does not deliver."}
{"text":"We chose to get a quick lunch here because they advertised free kids meals with adult entre.  Apparently that was false advertising after we were told what we ordered did not qualify even though we paid $16.99 for a shrimp Quesailla.  The service was slow the place was slow and the food was poor.  So much great food, deals and service to be had in Vegas don't  waste time here!"}
{"text":"Poor bartending service.  Was with a wedding party with a 2 hour open bar (which included a prepaid $500 gratuity) and the 2 bartenders took their time serving drinks, ignored one side of the bar and then messed up drinks....simple ones more than once.  I guess that is typical when you know you already got your tip.  Absolutely pathetic."}
{"text":"I got a promo code to redeem a Restaurant.com gift card.  So I selected this spot inside the Flamingo.  I was greeted by a friendly female host.  Hub & I decided to sit outside and enjoy the warmth.  The server, Denise, was very friendly, cool.  We ordered non-drinks, shrimp tacos & steak tacos.   It only took 10 mins.  I ordered the shrimp tacos which looked like they used Booth's pre-breaded frozen shrimp and carefully measured 3 shrimps per taco.  I have done this at home but at least add 6-7 not 3.  Plus it was a tad greasy for $20.  The rice was sticky, even the black beans didn't lubricate them.  The black beans were more blah, nothing exciting.  I love beans but this way will make u give them up.  The guac was average.  Taco Bell's had more flavor, zest.  The chips were as stall as 1 year old chewing gum.  No sea salt!!  Better yet let's let them soak in salt, they would have more flavor.  The salsa was more like whipped ketchup with a couple of ingredients.  This would explain why they want u to drink the 45 oz Big Mama margarita.  That's where the sea salt is, around the rim.  The patio is nice, spacious, birds flying everywhere.  Nature meets u!! Lol.  Would I recommend this place??   I'm not gonna make that determination for u, but I love seasoned food and quality food.  After reading this review do u think I found it??"}
{"text":"Despite the fact that this is a Mexican Restaurant, they also have barbecue...Who would have thought a Mexican joint would have the best BBQ in Vegas?!"}
{"text":"Wandering around the casinos looking for a place to have breakfast we decided on Carlos N Charlies.  This was mostly because we were hungry and wanted to drink but not tons of places were open yet that didn't have a wait.  They had a sign up about drink specials for mimosas so we went in.  Even though they were open and had the drink sign up they weren't actually serving drinks yet.  So we ordered food and waited.  The waitress was slow and eventually got our drinks once they started serving.  The drinks were tiny and the food way overpriced.  I would not come back here no matter how hungry I was."}
{"text":"Horrible service, worst margarita I've ever had, food sucked.  Guess if you're a drunk 20 something it would fine.  Horrible way too loud \"music\".  Waiter thought he should decide what we wanted for us, then ignore us.  Worst choice we made the whole weekend."}
{"text":"If you know anything about Mexican food, just skip it. This place is not so good. I had the Charlie's tacos. The meat was gross. The rice was okay. The taco fell apart after the first bite so I ate everything with a fork. My husband had a burrito which was so spicy he could hardly eat it, and he loves spicy food.  He also kept saying his drink Carlos margarita, tastes like toilet water.  It was outta of a slushy machine for certain. I have never left a restaurant leaving my plate pretty full and my drink half full. Waste of $"}
{"text":"I really liked the food and the drinks. Not the best Mexican but it gets 3 stars. Service sort of sucks and you are either the favorite child or the red headed step child as far as service is concerned. I wouldn't eat here again unless it was free"}
{"text":"Over priced. Not very good food.  Waitress was very nice.  Haven't been in a Carlos and Charlie's since a long ago trip to some Mexican beach vacation.  I don't recall the food being the low quality we had in this visit.  We were hungry for Mexican food;  So decided on C&C for lunch while at the Flamingo.  I had Charlie's tacos.  The meat was flavorful. Only reason this review isn't one star.  My daughter had the chicken enchiladas. There was almost no sauce on them;  and there was a sprinkling of peas. PEAS?? On chicken enchiladas?  She said the beans and rice were flavorless. Hubby had the carne asada burrito. He said it was okay.  He also said the beans/rice were flavorless.  We were not served chips and salsa. At the extremely high prices;  There should at least be chips and salsa.  Hubby's Grey Goose martini was tiny and he said it didn't tasty like Grey Goose.  Certainly didn't look anything like the GG martinis we usually drink."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed after seeing such great reviews on Groupon. This was one of the worst restaurant experiences and food I have had in Vegas. I think Groupon needs to educate their vendors on the reason why people by groupons...to save money...NOT so that we will \"get a free meal\" by not spending more then the groupon amount.   They have a good atmosphere, almost like a college bar, its fun, loud music and people pouring shots. But the food is terrible. Cold chicken and steak, like its been sitting in the back all day (worse than then chicken cubes soaking in broth at Subway) The food was just bland, no flavor or spice. My tacos came with a \"side\" of beans. The side was a one ounce cup filled with an over salted pile of mush. Luckily I didn't get the side of rice or guacamole that was suggested, everything was $2 or more extra. Also, what Mexican restaurant makes you pay for chips and salsa!?!?   On top of the terrible food, our server just hassled us all night about the Groupon. We spent only 38$ since the food was so bad I couldn't bring myself to try the \"delicious\" dessert suggested by the waitress who also suggested the \"amazing\" beans. Since we only spend $38 and the Groupon was for $40 the waitress made a huge deal and said we had to order more. Then she said 'well treat me right and I can get my manager to maybe over ride it. Even though that means you are getting your meal for free\"  WTF!!! Who is getting a free meal?? We BOUGHT a groupon!!!! She told us at least 5 times to tip her well because she got us a free meal. I was so angry that we even left her any tip, I would have rather spent that tip money on a slot machine. Please do yourself a favor and don't go here"}
{"text":"Updated my review to 1 star, then reconsidered given extenuating circumstances. I got no problem with C'n'C."}
{"text":"Wanted to grab a bit of Mexican food close to the sports book and this was in the proximity.    This place doesn't have the best reviews, but thought let's give it a shot.  Took a bit to get someone to take our order and the manager was in the neighborhood, so he took the order.    Started off with the ceviche and tortilla chips.  The ceviche is very bland and almost no flavor at all as it has tiny pieces of cod mixed in with tons of tomatoes, bits of onions and a few thin slices of avocado.   If you like bland ceviche, you will love it, if you like flavor add some Cholula or Tabasco hot sauce.    Also ordered the fajitas and came with a tiny portion size for $20.  The steak was flavorful and tender and the chicken was good as well.    Tried a sample of their margaritas and they were either too sweet or had too much lime.   I like a good strong margarita and these were too off the chart for me to order. Guess I'm used to the best frozen margarita in the land at Ztejas, in Costa Mesa, Ca.    Overall, the meal wasn't bad, but far from parable or great.  The service aspect of this restaurant definitely needs to be addressed, but I wouldn't expect any changes in the near future.  If you are not in a hurry and don't mind waiting, then it might work for you here.  If not, I would move on down the road for something quicker and tastier."}
{"text":"Terrible service, messed up both mine and my girlfriends breakfast and didn't hurry to fix it. Slow service a.d food was pretty awful, nothing autbentic here."}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone else had a bad time here, my party of 4 thoroughly enjoyed our time! Delicious food, wonderful attentive server (Amy), great atmosphere. The only thing we didn't like was the woman coming around trying to get us to dance and get rowdy, when all we wanted to do was eat and enjoy ourselves. I would love to come back."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve the one star. I should've known better and saved my friends and I from eating here when I was about to check in on my phone but we were hungry and wanted to eat ASAP. First off, horrible service! My friend specifically asked for something to be not on her food and they messed up the order! When my food came it was freezing cold. I never complain about food being cold but honestly, my food felt as though it was placed in the fridge for an hour so I sent back my food to get reheated. I could tell it was reheated and just sat there before it was served to me again because the tortillas for my tacos were dry and crunchy yet the meat was still cold! I didn't wanna waste anymore time here so I decided to shut up and just eat the horrible quality meat. The chorizo was okay, but the chicken tasted fake to me, yuck. Mind you our food took forever to come out! The manager was kind enough to give us free chips and salsa... guess I'll give the one star to the manager. Other than that, this place needs to seriously work on management and food quality.  Oh yeah, all of our waters were empty for a good 20-35 minutes and nobody came by to refill our drinks so I literally got up and found a pitcher of water and refilled all of our drinks. Customers shouldn't be doing that!!"}
{"text":"The \"manager\" here is the absolute worst human being I've encountered with my entire life. He screamed in my face, cursed at me, held me and my group hostage, and threatened our lives tonight. A \"manager\" should NEVER treat a customer this way, especially if they want to make money. This place is a dump and honestly is 100% because of the stank attitude from the management and wait staff. Even the security team were complaining about him and encouraged us to call corporate on the establishment. It's sad when the casino doesn't even want to be associated with this place. They're a total embarrassment to the Flamingo. Glad he lives in Vegas so he'll be used to the heat in Hell while he's rotting away."}
{"text":"Our experience here was fine. Good service and decent food. No complaints but nothing outstanding. I like that you can sit outside and get away from the smokey casino. Delicious shrimp quesadilla!"}
{"text":"The Staff was friendly.  We were in a hurry and they brought the food quickly.  Our meal was below our standards.  Presentation below average.  Over priced.  Avoid the restrooms."}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars based on exemplary service, pretty good margaritas (2 for 1 during happy hour!), and table-side guacamole.  There were about 10 of us (started with 5, we kept growing over the afternoon), our servers were fun and friendly.  We had a blast!  Great outdoor people watching and good margaritas!"}
{"text":"This was a huge mistake. We were looking to eat somewhere close and since we were staying in the Flamingo we chose this place. Our server didn't even wait on us, another waitress came apologized and took our order. The quesadilla that I ordered was large but lacked flavor. One of the other tables had to go get the waiter for our checks and when I got it, I couldn't believe that iced tea was $3.99."}
{"text":"Ok I just loved the chicken Parmesan and Swiss over potatoes. Soooo good!!! And soooo much food. My love ordered some burrito and normally I would have asked what kind and took a picture but I was starving and since I took one potato and cheese sauce I was done one picture and started scarfing down this yummy meal. I did pop my head up fans ask how his burrito was, he said really good. Then I was back to stuffing my face. Lol.   My complaint is the margaritas weak as hell!!! That frozen slush tasted like a slurpee from 7-11 I had mango and he had strawberry after asking our server if there was any corn products in them because he is allergic to corn. She said not in the strawberry but yes in the mango. Oh and they were out of passion fruit btw I love passion fruit anything!!! We there must have been corn syrup in the strawberry margarita because he got violently ill like he always does when corn is involved. This is why only one star. We checked with our server about corn in his food and his drink and told her that he was allergic to corn and corn products. Apparently their staff is not trained on food allergies. I'm guessing fructose was in the margarita mix which is a corn byproduct.   Had that not happened we would have given them 5 stars."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here twice in three days and breakfast once. We enjoyed the Fajitas that were mixed with several varieties of peppers and sweet onions. The staff was great and the manager stopped by to get our feedback twice. I would recommend this restaurant to friends and family."}
{"text":"Do not get the BBQ ribs. Lousy at best. Even the corn on the cob sucked, and the fries were stale. The \"bartenders\" were nothing but kids goofing off juggling cups and bottles. Didn't even have Bohemia beer and charged me $35 for a shot of 1842. Oh yeah, and $5 for a bag of chips and salsa. What a joke..."}
{"text":"They'd get a zero if I could.   Service is terrible.   Tacos are worse.   Only plus is the Coors Lights were 2x1"}
{"text":"A few bucks can go a long way. Always tip the people who serve you.   We sat at the bar and ordered guac & chips ... Little did we know it was made table side which is incredibly inconvenient to the bar tender but the manager came to help out, we tipped him a few dollars - he acted like he'd never seen money before! So after that the manager got us a few more 2 or 1 beers (happy hour had been over for a half hour already).    We also ordered the quesadillas and they were really good.   Sit outside, the barstools are super fun. Plus there's a DJ playing good tunes.... The servers come out and dance to certain songs and get customers involved.   Overall I liked the place."}
{"text":"Great food and Lance the bartender has been helpful with his tips and tricks being first timers in Vegas. His food recommendations have been good! Been there twice in three days. We would had visited in the timeframe of February 6-10. I can't remember the exact days we went to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Alfonso at the bar is awesome and funny! The civeche is delicious.....would definitely come back just to conversate to al :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and the food is delicious. This was our 1st visit here and we loved it! We love good food and service!"}
{"text":"Stopped to grab a drink without reading the yelp..... Yes I should know better! Read the other reviews and give this place a miss!"}
{"text":"Pretty horrible....we made a major mistake based on convenience. Do yourself a favor and not stop here."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while walking through the Flamingo.  We took advantage of the 2 for $10 margaritas, but got them to go so we could walk through the garden.  We tried a passion fruit and a mango and have to say that they were delicious. Very real fruit flavors and not too sweet at all. They were not very strong, but were delicious as I observed the birds and koi in the garden.    At 2pm on a Friday, the place was empty, maybe due to the fact that the outdoor area was closed for the winter, but I would recommend taking advantage of the drink special and then hitting the sites."}
{"text":"I always have a handful of groupons when I go to Vegas to save money and try new places. I regret buying this one. First of all, this is Mexican food you would find in the Midwest. So gross. Just because you put sauce and peppers on everything doesn't make it Mexican food. We had 4 different servers helping us. One came to the table and said \"what do you want\" Uhhhh ok. Then we paid extra for the guacamole and it was not made fresh at our table. It was frozen and tasted like water. The food was way over priced even for the vegas strip. Who wants to pay $16 for a tiny gross burrito?! And to top it off after being left disappointed and hungry we had to wait 20 minutes for the bill.  I love the flamingo hotel and they needed a younger place like this but they missed the mark this time."}
{"text":"What a terrible \"nightclub\" experience. The $25 open bar from 10-1 isn't even worth it when you take into account that it is absolutely DEAD inside and they don't care about their patrons.  I had a drink spilled on me, people were sneaking in and harassing us for our drinks, called us fags, and the staff treated us like we were the problems. The African American security guard actually yelled at us that \"she was a woman\" (who dressed like a man, and therefore our experience was supposed to be lessened).   A note to Raphael and the security guard: if you're trying to create an enjoyable experience, you're failing miserably. You shouldn't ever YELL at patrons, especially a female. It might make you feel tough, but this is a bar. Get a grip.  To everyone else, save yourself the disappointment. I wish I could give zero stars."}
{"text":"I was so upset with this restaurant. I came here with my sisters for a later dinner and there were maybe 2 other tables with people seated and a few people at the bar. When we walked in, we asked if they were still serving dinner and we were told yes. We sat down any where we wanted and it took 10 min just to receive a menu.  After looking at the menu, everything was over priced. We decided to stay to grab something simple, and there were two servers standing in front of our table arguing that neither of them wanted to take our table. WHAT!? We could literally hear them, and instead of one of them deciding to help us, they both just walked away and we were never helped!!   We got up and left immediately. I couldn't believe the service at this place. Glad we didn't spend any money there because they do not deserve it!"}
{"text":"I would say it reminds me of Carlos Murph's back in the day. A bit on the high side (12 bucks for a quesadilla) but it's Vegas! Food was your typical bar food. Great outdoor atmosphere. We sat inside snd it was okay."}
{"text":"Service was so slow, sucked and food was overpriced and not very good.  Definitely not world famous for any good reasons."}
{"text":"I would give this place NO stars if I could. Went there for lunch with a friend when we were craving mexican cantina food (hoping it would be like paradise cantina). At around 11:45am it was still pretty empty so we were seated quickly and the server came over and took our drink order. He asked if he could sit down a few times which I thought was totally inappropriate seeing as he interrupted our conversation to ask. I was initially craving a taco salad of some sort but the only dressings they had to offer were Caesar and Italian. I was hoping for a more south of the border salad so I chose the chicken enchiladas (who doesn't love rice and beans and sauce!!) my friend ordered a chicken sandwich and fries. Our server told us that he didn't like our choices and tried to push us toward other (more pricy and larger dinner entree style) options. We explained why we chose what we chose and our food was delivered to us within 5 min. I'm not usually one to be negative about quick service but 5 min seemed a little microwaved or pre-cooked and warmed up to me. Regardless we thanked them for the quick service. We the dishes were put down in front of us my friends chicken sandwich looked good. Hot, crisp but thick french fries and a juicy chicken filet. My chicken enchiladas however were topped with a red sauce that tasted like a pizza sauce or thin marinara and then melted over everything was SWIS CHEESE. WTF?!?! I had my friend taste everything just to be sure I wasn't losing my mind and sure enough....italian red sauce and swiss cheese covered my enchiladas. SO WEIRD!! Needless to say I eat much of the enchiladas and was looking forward to the rice and beans but even they were \"rice a roni\" style spanish rice and the beans weren't fresh or very good either. SO GROSS!!!  The busier was quick to clear our plates but that was when the quickness stopped. The restaurant was no busier than when we arrived but we had to wait 45 minutes for the server to bring us the check and another 20 minutes for his to run our credit cards. He about disappeared a few times. I think it's really sad when it takes only 5 minutes from ordering our food to receiving our food and then an hour to pay the check?! COME ON FLAMINGO....UP YOUR GAME HERE. THE PRICES ARE WAY TO HIGH AND THE FOOD IS TERRIBLE AND THE SERVICE WASN'T REALLY THERE."}
{"text":"Stopped here for drinks after having dinner at another restaurant. It was a Thursday afternoon and the place wasn't that busy. We sat at the bar, for as dead as the place was the service  wasn't fast. We waited a while for the bartender to come to us. She told us certain drinks were buy one get one and I thought it was a good deal. I ordered a frozen margarita and got one free. We'll both margaritas were very weak which is why it's bogo.  The outside bar and dining area are nice but the service and drinks were not impressive."}
{"text":"Frozen margaritas are actually a lot of sugar presented in a beer glass Just one waitress on entire patio with a terrible service. They closed the patio at 9pm and they 'forgot' to tell us, just camed and put the bill on the table. Inside no service at all ... 15 minutes nobody comes to my table so I left."}
{"text":"Bad service, my meal came and they forgot about my wife. Just the two of us there. We shared my food and hers came 20 minutes later. Ready to leave and couldn't find anyone forever. Amazingly disappointing."}
{"text":"First off, let me say that I just enjoyed 6 nights at the Flamingo. Many times I frequented this establishment and not once was I ever disappointed. In fact, I actually looked forward to going! I had the enchiladas, rice and beans. Everything was extremely flavorful and in good portions. To be honest I wished there had a BIT more red sauce, but that's a minor thing. The nachos looked great as well. As did the cheese dip. There is Happy Hour everyday from 2-6 and anytime football is on the screen. That is really the time to come. I enjoyed sitting outside and chatting with other guests around the bar. Everyone was friendly. TIP: When you come here and there is any issue whatsoever with your food, drinks or service, ask immediately to speak with Amy. I had the pleasure of getting to know Amy and beyond any doubt, she is extremely capable of handling any situation. And she will do it with a smile and a pleasant demeanor. If owned a restaurant, I would want her working for me. I promise you that Amy will make it right."}
{"text":"I went here after accidentally having some of my friend's frozen margarita that he got here. He told me it was a mango smoothie, and since the drink was so weak, I believed him. Now I used to drink, especially when I would come down to Vegas, and I've drank in plenty of places outside of Utah, so I know I good drink. Quite possibly the drink was weak due to the fact that we all got wristbands for this place, and for a $25 cover, it was all the domestics and well drinks you wanted, with the ability to come and go as you please. I watched my friends down probably 5 of the frozen margaritas and at least 2 buds each, and neither was even slightly buzzed. I'm pretty sure that the frozen margarita mix MIGHT have a shot per serving, but the taste was good from my little but I had.  As far as the atmosphere...eh. It definitely attracts some of the lower quality, and probably the more frugal people in Vegas, and they allow people to enter who are wearing sweats, so that should give enough of a picture of the majority of the crowd that comes in. The people dancing seemed to be enjoying themselves though! A lot of top 40, which seemed weird because it has more of a Mexican or western style feel. All in all, this isn't a place I would plan to return to, but with the kind of drink special they have, and for being inside one of the lower end Strip hotels (the Flamingo), I definitely see why/how this place is the way it is."}
{"text":"My mom and I tried this place last night. However, we were in a rush because of a show we were going to in a half hour or so. We ordered the Ceviche to share. It came out pretty quickly even though we were antsy. The Ceviche was served with chips, which were kinda stale but I'm not picky. Just thought I'd throw that in there for future diners. Anyway, I don't know if it was because we were in a rush, if we were hungry, or if we genuinely thought it was good. I mean, it was good but for the price, maybe not. They should probably consider bringing the price down a little bit LOL. Their drinks are really overpriced though, $3.75 for a grande sized soda. Our bill for the Ceviche and two drinks was $27. YOWZA! I'd probably not go back, but I have nothing really bad to say about the place."}
{"text":"We purposely received a dinner menu at 12noon cause we mentioned we had a voucher $15 for $30 worth of food i found on one of my apps. The menu was pricey but we were in vegas for a trip and our first time at this place. My husband was disappointed with his burrito already ($17+)and as soon as we left i see a sign for lunch specials( around $10) and she never even offered them. I got oily ceviche for $16.  I hate shady businesses and the food wasnt worth it by a long shot. Would never recommend unless u know better or are desperate."}
{"text":"The food wasn't terrible, but by far isn't the best mexican food i've had. Service is good and the food tasted fresh. I'm just a mexican food snob."}
{"text":"We have been to this place a couple times. this last time it was for a birthday party. We had 20 people in our party and they took good care of us. The food was good and the drinks were good. Not real happy with the margaritas though. They seem a bit weak. But our waiter, Jason, was great."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to.  Food = No.    We threw the red flag on our meal as soon as they told us they charge for chips and salsa.... we ordered the cheese dip and chips and the cheese dip was worse than something out of a carnival vending machine.  The service was a joke and after ordering drinks (beers) for 5 people and chips/cheese dip, our total was $65 and we left.  This is not a Mexican restaurant and it's one of the worst restaurants in Vegas in my opinion.  Listen to the other reviews on here and don't bother."}
{"text":"We ate here twice during our trip to Vegas for Memorial Day weekend. I though the food, atmosphere, & people were all great. All the wait staff dance to the songs & get the people at the tables to join in. It was a ton of fun & decent priced. It is def one of the better restaurants in the flamingo & I would absolutely go back again. The tortilla soup & passion fruit margarita were delicious :)   Just don't get the big mama it's $26 & the cup isn't as large as it appears. But besides that, it is great!"}
{"text":"Back again at the Flamingo. The hotel has closed its coffee shop and cut back the hours on the buffet so the only places to eat most of the time is either here, the steakhouse, or the food court.   Unfortunately I can't say anything good about Carlos & Charlie's again. The food is expensive and mediocre. The drinks are expensive and weak. The service is slow because there isn't enough staff.   Go eat somewhere in The Linq. I wish I hadn't tried this place again."}
{"text":"First of all, the host was one of the rudest people I ever met. I broke my ankle out at the Flamingo pool and had borrowed a wheelchair from the hotel, and I asked him what the easiest way was to get through the restaurant to reach where my friends were sitting and he was not helpful. I told him nevermind, and asked if I could park the wheelchair somewhere out of the way so I could just hobble to my table. That's when he started treating me like I had a mental handicap and even started yelling at me.   I was very upset and the waiter tried to assure me that the host probably didn't speak enough english to understand me. But then we ordered brunch and the experience got even worse. The bacon looked like it had been sitting on the floor for a few days and even stepped on several times. And, the bloody marys were all ice.  Sure, it's conveniently located if you're staying at the Flamingo but the horrible stomach aches and verbal abuse by the staff is not worth it."}
{"text":"I'll walk next door to Margaritaville next time. The service was horrible from the moment I was greeted. The hostess told me to go sit at the bar since I was alone so I sat at the inside bar (not knowing there was an outside bar) for about 10 mins and a serve"}
{"text":"First came here in summer of 2015, had a rock'n good time at night with their open bar. Lots of people having a good time. Came back again in 2017, and this place had like a third of the people and the open bar price went up to $25 per person rather than $20. Stayed like 10 minutes the second time and left."}
{"text":"No stars. Cold toast, cold taters/ bad breakfast food in general. And cold environment. I was freezing."}
{"text":"I'm not really quite sure why this place is considered mexican.  It's more of an American restaurant.  But they do offer a lot of specials and their frozen margarita drinks are tasty.  However their food doesn't really impress me.  It's more of a dive bar to go sit and throw back a few drinks rather than a restaurant to come and dine at."}
{"text":"This was the best night in Vegas I have had since I was 20.  I went to Vegas with my daughter's volleyball team and had to plan a dinner for 30.  Carlos'n Charlies was fantastic!  We had our own private outdoor patio.  Carlos, our waiter, was phenomenal.  The manager (I can't remember his name, but he said to just call him the Russian guy) took great care of us!   We had the large flasks of margaritas and beer for the adults and the kids had balloon animals and music and dancing.  Adults and kids both had a fantastic time.  I would strongly suggest any group plan a dinner here while in town."}
{"text":"We were craving Mexican and wanted somewhere fun and casual for our last night in Vegas. FOUND IT. We were seated outside and it was really nice. Our server (I think Rocky - her name was smudged) was very attentive and helpful to our table. The HH specials were great for our group of 4. We got two Marg's for $10...and the boys got deals on their beers, but I don't exactly remember what it was. We ordered the chips & salsa & altho they weren't bottomless, there was plenty for the 4 of us.   I ordered the chicken quesadilla off the App menu & it was a perfect little meal. My brother asked for their HOTTEST sauce/salsa. It came out & holy smokes it was hot! I spread a tiny dot on my quesadillas.  (OH the Gauc was REALLY good!)  The prices all seemed really reasonable & Yelp has all sorts of deals when you check in. We will be back on our next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Not sure why so many low reviews.  Maybe they didn't order a drink while they were there?  I was actually surprised how much i like the place, we ended up going there several times last weekend.  Breakfast- Had a breakfast burrito and was surprised on how good it was, slightly spicey along side a huge pile of potatoes.  All you can drink for 20-  Me and my group of friends took advantage of this.  The only thing i didn't like was that Rolling rock was their only choice for beer.  Buy one get one Plastic Margarita glass- They were okay, a little weak.  Nachos- Must try.  These were the largest pile of nachos good enough to feed several drunk friends.  If you are a sports better you can get free drink tickets at the flamingo sports betting cage."}
{"text":"I dont know why the bad reviews, when we went here the staff was awesome not to mention the atmosphere. This was a Friday night and things were quite fun. They have inside and outside seating but the drinks can only be consumed when buying the $20 unlimited wrist band inside which is fine because thats where the DJ was anyway. The food was great no complaints at all!! I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best service I've had in Vegas. The Groupon deals are so worth it. Spent $41 and was able to drink unlimited for 4 hours plus an entree. Was able to leave and come back any time in that 4 hours. Servers were attentive and quick. The chili con Carne nachos were so delicious! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We were hoping for a great experience, but we got drive by and immature service and very sub-standard food. Pass this one by."}
{"text":"Had a Really fun time there! It was to me a BETTER version of Joe's Crab Shack but with Delicious Mexican food. Lots of fun, interaction with the staff there was great, a whole lot of dancing around, and the food was GREAT! Im shocked to why i lived in vegas my whole life and never been to this place....will be goin back for a fact!!!!"}
{"text":"WISH I COULD GIVE NO STARS!  The worst place EVER. HORRIBLE. TERRIBLE. RUN TO A DIFFERENT RESTAURANT. (Margaritaville if possible!!)  We ate here on a Wednesday. They are located at the Flamingo on the Las Vegas Strip. We had a Groupon. We initially contacted the restaurant on Tuesday night, at 10:30 PM and were told the restaurant closed at 2 AM, I checked their website on the Flamingo website and same thing- it was open until the \"wee hours\". PERFECT. We are STARVING!  We drive over to the Flamingo, park and walk over to the restaurant. It looks empty, except for a few individuals at the bar. We walk in and the bartender bluntly says they are closed and the kitchen is closed and cannot serve us. No \"I'm sorry\". No \"We open at xxx tomorrow and close at xxx\". NOTHING. Jerk.  Well we decide to give them a try the NEXT day. Same guy, didn't remember us, fine. Whatever. We sit down, I order a drink and my boyfriend orders a water for the mean time while he looks over the menu. They had a special, 2 Rolling Rocks for $7. Not bad- he goes with that. We chit-chat, look over the menu, chit-chat some more, give our order. My boyfriend orders Street Tacos with guacamole at a whopping $2-3 more and I order the Fish Tacos, no guar.   Here comes our order... three street tacos and guac on a plate and three fish tacos. The Street Tacos were good, but for $15, plus the price of the guac, and NO rice or beans to accompany them, sorry! Those should be much less. Yes, I understand it IS Las Vegas, BUT geez louise- don't go all out on the price if you are not adding anything to accompany the tacos! My fish tacos were hard! VERY HARD! Was I unhappy. The breading was much bigger than the actual piece of fish.  I'll finish this off on a good note.. just kidding.. BAD NOTE! Not once did the lazy bartender ever come to see how our food was. There were two bartenders at the bar, one had about two or three groups and our bartender only had us to wait on. The other bartender was constantly making drinks for the tables, conversating with the other guests/customers. Ours was just there with a lame straight face on. So uncomfortable.   I just wanted to leave.  Mind you- ANOTHER customer came up to the bar, talked to our bartender about her experience and the lousy service she received. He gave her a comment card, I wish I could of gotten my hands on one of those.  Just in case you are wondering- No, I did NOT TIP."}
{"text":"Nah, no, don't do it.  Go somewhere else, please.  Unlesd you're there just to drink.  Doubt liquor is lower quality than the grub.  I had the breakfast.  I wish i went to McDs instead."}
{"text":"We just had a late lunch at C&C's. I had the chicken and cheddar Chimi and it was fantastic. I asked for it to be wet (covered with the red enchilada sauce). My husband had the fish sandwich. He said it was okay at best. He had two house margaritas and they were good. I had two beers and the beer was cold. The service was fantastic though.   The biggest complaint was the price. It was over $75 for lunch for two with two drinks each. That is WAY too expensive for what we had. I started to order guacamole, but it was over $10. I'd recommend going across to the Link and having lunch at the Yard House or the Tilted Kilt. The food and drinks are much better and less expensive."}
{"text":"It's Mexican food at the Flamingo, so my expectations were tempered. So, this review is on a bell curve.  1. The place was pretty busy, but we got service right away, and it was very friendly and attentive.  2. We all ordered salads. I had the chicken fajita salad, which came with a hearty portion of protein, so yay.  3. Tons of chips and salsa.  4. The people watching scene: if Duck Dynasty and Vikings (the warriors, not the football players) pooled genes, these were the product of their special love -- but in a really hot way! ;D"}
{"text":"The worst I have ever had! Me and my group had ate here in 2017 where the food was great! But this year on 06/23 me and my group ate here and from the tacos to the beans and rice was so disappointing. The food and drinks took well over 45 mins to get and once we had ate the food me and my group got sick! they don't grill there meat like a real taco should have! there waitress was very rude and taking care of 10 other tables! my experience was very horrible and will never go back again! If I could rate this - 0 stars I would"}
{"text":"I go to all of the Harrah's properties USA wide. This Mexican cookery is BEYOND TERRIBLE! It is nothing but a swirl job to hook you in and charge to double for all items. Here's how much it is a real Mexican restaurant. I asked for some \"hot sauce\" and they brought me \"some from the back that they make up for the employee's\" They DO NOT HAVE any hot sauce on the table besides some bottles stuff that we all can buy in a store..??? ZERO!  They DO NOT have ANY hot sauce for their customers!! The salsa and chips that they charge you for,  I think $5.00 (not free) the salsa looks as plain as \"stewed tomatoes\" give me a break!! It is a COMPLETE JOKE of over priced Mexican food that does NOT even come up to Taco Bell standards!! HONESTLY!! Never again!! A COMPLETE JOKE in ever aspect!! Here is the summary's you want some food that resembles Mexican food that is BLAND and you feel like paying $12.00 for a $5.00 burrito then go here! gOING TO taco bell is more spicy, exciting and fullfilling that this place! Food for people in a REST HOME!  I live in Cali and the TACO TRUCKS taste better that this $H!T....!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday with a groupon, 40 dollars.  We ordered chips and salsa for 6 dollars, no that is not a typo.  It arrived in....get this, a paper bag. Salsa was bland.  They would not honor the TR price, but that is understandable with the groupon, just want you all to know that.  I ordered the chicken mole enchiladas.....horrible!!  The chicken was disgusting, I had to eat around it, which was not easy.  My husband got the pulled pork sandwich.  He said it tasted ok.  The prices are beyond stupid expensive, save your money and get better Mexican food at El Pollo Loco."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here, the food was alright... Over priced and under cooked. I had an omelette... It wasn't very good, super runny. The potatoes and beens however were awesome!!! The service was mediocre at best, not attentive and took forever to get drinks. Not the worst I've ever had, but you're better off spending your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"One of the worst service in Vegas! Wish I Could give this place zero stars. The food was ok. Not great. Came here for breakfast, Our server was a lady with the worst attitude! Looked like she hated her job! I asked for a Bloody Mary and she forgot it I had to remind her and the drink was still brought to me after I was done eating. No reason for forgetting my drink since the place was empty! I didn't get her name-she is a Caucasian lady with tattoos all over her body and a lot piercings on her face. Oh but I'll be back to the flamingo casino and I'll catch a picture of her and update my review.  Boyfriend and I felt she was racist because she helped everyone but us. Being a Mexican restaurant I think you can expected Mexicans customers. No tip her and not coming back again."}
{"text":"The outdoor area is seat yourself. I did and waited forever for a greeting and a glass of water. I ordered the chicken and cheese burrito and then ordered the cheese dip with chips. Needless to say, they both left much to be desired. Nothing was fresh about this meal. The cheese dip was flavorless and the burrito was something I make at home-- mine is better. The beans were crusty and dry and the chicken inside the burrito tasted like it was out of a can. Service was slow even though they were not packed and there were no specials offered at any point. The cheese dip and chips cost $10.50. It was very disappointing. Will not return."}
{"text":"Cheap drink specials, and tasty margaritas but this place is not for me.  I'm not into fog machines, laser lights, way too loud club music and a bass beat that made my head throb.  I'm not a fossil, but certainly way too old for this place. Table-made guacamole had way to much onion in it but the chips and salsa were decent.  Pretty bland chicken quesadilla."}
{"text":"Come on people, you're in Vegas. If you want a mile high stack of decent nachos and a bowl of delicious beans that not outrageously priced then come here if it's convenient. It's not horrible but it's not amazing, worth it if staying in the Flamingo and need a Mexican fix."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Worst enchiladas I've had in my life. Dry meat dry corn tortillas with a big thick layer of coagulated cheese on top. I've had better refried beans out of a can and you don't even get chips and salsa for the price. Just more overpriced Las Vegas Strip crap. Margaritas we're very average and they don't use real juice for mix. Avoid this place like the plague unless you're just there to burn money and get drunk"}
{"text":"Stopped in to rest & grab a bite to eat. The pyramid nachos were outstanding. Could not finish the place between the two of us, make more for 4-6 people. Also a great place to watch college football, countless TV's. Great friendly service! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible and very slow, they barely paid attention to us, food was just okay... I wouldn't go back or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I was served my $16.75 drink in a plastic cup. When I asked for a glass she brought me this and expects me to pour it myself. Where is margarita glass? Skip this place treated like a kid here. Plastic cups and cheep utensils. Booth seats are too low also."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast and it was very good- great change of pace from the normal Las Vegas food.  We came back later that night for dinner and we were underwhelmed, salsa was\"ok\" and the margaritas were marginal. Food was ok as well, not as good as the breakfast.   3 Stars - come for breakfast!"}
{"text":"BREAKFAST review only. don't do it. hard to screw up brekkie but they did it. and lackluster service to boot. my oatmeal was on par with cafeteria, and was served with no butter, milk or sugar by a server who slowed down to two miles an hour to throw it on our table and keep going. my hubbys huevos rancheros were mediocre with dry toast. they might have good cocktails but don't bother waking up to this one."}
{"text":"If you want the best service hit up JJ at the bar. Fast. Friendly.  Flair.  One of the best bartenders on the strip. Carlos and Charlie ' s has great drink specials. It's a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Enjoyable atmosphere. Tucked away inside Flamingo hotel. Try the queso dip and street corn!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came in here around 8 o'clock on a April 11th for a quick bite. The restaurant had barely anyone there and the bar was empty so we figured we would be in an out. There was only one bartender and it took him about 5 minutes to even realize we were sitting there. He finally came over and we ordered right away, chicken nachos. While the plate was full it took about 40 minutes for them to come out. Nachos are a pretty simple dish it shouldn't take that long. They were just OK and again the bartender never checked on us, didn't even try to sell us any drinks. We had to call him over to take our payment and when we did he just came over and said \"yea what's up?\" I expect a little more professionalism when I'm trying to pay my tab. He had is back to us the entire time we could have walked out without even paying. By the way they were $25 and NOT worth it!"}
{"text":"The habanero salsa was BOMB. Proceed with caution. I love love love spicy food and salsa never seem to be spicy enough, despite the \" beware: super spicy\" warning. We had the tacos Charlie (probably didn't get the name right). They had chicken, beef, and chorizo. Very tasty. The food was a little pricey for what you get, but I didn't mind it too much, considering the food wasn't awful."}
{"text":"Where do I start, should have read the reviews 1st. The hostess sat us down at a table that was so dirty under the table it was gross the waiter cleaned it up, but gross, it was empty and the service was awful the taquitos were the frozen type, ask for salsa instead of quac and then he charged us for a side of quac when I said I want the quac now, he said oh you already order the salsa with it. He was pretty much an ass about it. Avoid this place go to Chayos. I am surprised the employees act and treat guests like they do with the reviews on here. I would have left no tip but my husband is a nice guy."}
{"text":"Went here on a busy Saturday afternoon. Quite a lively place especially with the pool next door being open. It's a great place to people watch. The bartenders are interactively entertaining and party poopers aren't Welcome. Omid the bartender was just exhilarating, got everyone involved & had a Bachelorette group going wild.   The food is alright. Won't lie. Just go for the entertainment. Omid is definitely a must see."}
{"text":"First let me say that I am not a picky eater but yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.  I paid $17 for fish tacos that were nothing more than a fish stick fried for WAY too long topped with some orange ranch type sauce on flour tortillas, oh the humanity!  I didn't even get any mediocre rice or beans with my entree.  Chips and salsa were $6! Who pays for chips and salsa at a Mexican place? Overpriced is an understatement.    The servers tried to do a dance.  It was waaaaay too long and repetitive, I wanted to scream out \"Please stop, can't you see they aren't having fun? Put them out of their misery!\"   The only cool thing was the bartenders.  They were very talented.  I am uber clumsy so when I see people throwing things and catching them too, my mind pretty much gets blown. Doesn't take much, I guess.  Those poor men should find another place of employment however, because unless Carlos and Charlie's changes the foods quality, I don't see them lasting as a Vegas establishment. Eat ANYWHERE but here."}
{"text":"5 stars for our server......one star for the cooks/or food runners lack there of. 4 tables in the restaurant, we watched two get their food after we ordered, so we were estimating that our apps were on there way......nope....still waiting...it's only a order of nachos & wings....still waiting...I figure it's ok since wings do take a lil longer to cook.....still waiting....30 minutes our apps arrive. Cold!!!!!!!!!! Seriously!!!!! It's no wonder they have horrible reviews and such a low star rating on here!"}
{"text":"As soon as we sat down, my party of 6 ordered the chips and salsa, pitcher of margaritas and the guacamole. The guacamole was made by hand right in front of us, which I loved. I got to see every ingredient placed by hand.   I explained that I was vegan, so I went ahead and ordered the veggie fajitas. Our waiter has been tons of fun! Our group really fits in with the atmosphere of this place. It is loud, and it's fun too. We came for dinner after a show at about 10pm. There are groups dancing and others yelling but it's vegas at 10pm and it really is a fun place to be.   The chips and salsa are a set price (aprox. $6) but I can't complain, because it is the Las Vegas strip and here you get what you pay for. Or, you pay for what you get.   The wait time isn't extremely lengthy. It actually is perfect, especially if you're in a large group. All in all, the environment is very fun. I would definitely recommend this for an after show dinner grab. The waiter has been so kind and helpful. And the food is good too."}
{"text":"I really can't add anything that hasn't already been said.  Save yourself a lot of $$ and DO NOT go here unless you already purchased a Groupon.  In that case use the Groupon and then ask for a refund because the food is THAT BAD.  The food is also way over priced.  Lethal combo in my book.  The service was OK, but not great by any means."}
{"text":"Average place. We went here because we had some comps to use and it wasn't crowded.   Had the chicken quesadilla and some margaritas.  The margaritas were decent. Quesadilla served its purpose as a snack. Wouldn't break my neck to go back but would consider it because it is convenient and they have happy hour."}
{"text":"NO SERVICE, NO SALSA, NO SMILE  We had walked by several times and finally decided to stop one night when the music wasn't so loud and the bar wasn't packed. We didn't want to fight for a table so it was a good time, late at night. All we wanted was chips and salsa. We sat at the bar but quickly grew impatient as we weren't noticed.  Once we finally received our menus the bartender had left to do something. I forget what they were asking for the chips and salsa but we'd been told it was just one salsa, (no \"hot\" option; no \"verde\" option) so for whatever the price was we didn't think it was worth it and ended up walking out.   Didn't even get a goodbye.  Note: We did however have a great time another night taking pictures on the four stools as you enter. Fun stuff!"}
{"text":"Ugh.  Food that is not nearly as good as Taco Bell is priced like it's four diamond fare.  And to go with it, enjoy the weakest drinks on the strip.  The only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of one is that the service was good."}
{"text":"Definitely don't recommend for breakfast . . .  We wanted a regular breakfast menu and asked one of the staff who said we should go here.  The menu was not a \"regular breakfast menu\" - we were looking for American, which we were led to believe by the staff person.  Main thing was regular breakfast combo's (eggs, meat, toast/pancakes) was not on the menu.  Seemed like lot of a la carte items and few other combos that were basically eggs, plus refried beans or potatoes.  We opted for Scrambled Eggs with Potatoes (blah, didn't finish) and a Breakfast Burrito surprisingly tasty!) Relative to other places, this place is pricey for small breakfast.  It's minimum $10-13 per person (no drinks), and the 2 Eggs and Potatoes alone was $11.  Also, the guy hosting was not totally overt, but he was condescending.  Offered to sit us at the bar first (nobody else was there and there were tons of tables open) and when we asked for table, he sighed and led us to a booth next to a large noisy group (gee, thanks!).  Waitress was rather scattered . . . We saw the manager(?) serve food - She leaned over a kid across the large group's table to hand a plate to a woman - seriously?  Need to go to waitressing school!  (And, even though we almost ran into him, no \"thanks for coming\" - He definitely needs to learn about customer service or just get an attitude agjustment . . .)  Go do the buffet or head to Denny's or somewhere else.  We wouldn't come back to this place . . . And, given how happy they were to seat and serve us, we won't be back for any other meal either."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. Awful service, awful drinks, awful prices. We were lured in by the pretty outside view and the buy one get one free coupons we were given for margaritas (spoiler alert they just double the price of the drink and add waaay too little alcohol). Our server came over once after mouthing obscenities to himself when he saw our table sit down. It was pretty deserted except for a group of people wearing obscene balloon animal hats (blow jobs, penises, scissoring - who knew balloon art could be used as a force of evil!).   I don't have one good thing to say about this place. UGH!"}
{"text":"We had a groupon so we decided to try this place. I'm glad we did because it was really good. We ordered the guacamole for an appetizer and didn't expect the guy to come out and literally make it in front of us. It was awesome. The burritos Charlie's were delicious. I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Weak coffee and weak bloody Mary's are a little pricey for being half price of $5. If you want your eggs your way don't come here. Service was poor but but the food was not bad to make it 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Flamingo and have been to several CnS before, so we assumed we knew what we were getting into. We were wrong. The waiter (1048 John G) sucked. He was barely ever around and instead of wise ass remarks that we are used to on occasion, he was just rude. The drinks were made very poorly and the cheese dip we ordered came out cold and almost solid. Dont bother going to this place."}
{"text":"Great place, the Nachos Will easily feed 4 or more people. The bartender made one of the bloody marys. Service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"I don't know what people are complaining about.....  This is pretty awesome for bar food. Ceviche and guacamole are both very yummy. Service is friendly, there's good music, and entertainment.  At one point the bartenders put on a show and gave out free shots.  I just don't get the reviews at all!"}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant a half of star I would as it is that bad. The atmosphere and the patio are awesome but sadly this restaurant has horrible food. I had the Chicken Fajitas and you would think you can't go wrong with them but you can as the chicken was dry and had to flavor. The chips and salsa you have to pay for and the salsa tastes like some cheap store bought salsa that was premade.I have been so several mexican restaurants in California to San Antonio to Arizona and many here but this is for sure on the bottom of my list. You could go down up the street to Peppermill and get nachos which have more flavor and taste than this restaurants nachos and they don't even specialize in mexican food."}
{"text":"Abandon all hope ye who enter here.  Carlos n Charlie's is not charming. They do not have good food. They do not have good prices. The service is the turd on the top of this poop sundae; they straight up refused to let us split checks (between two parties) and scoffed at the idea of subbing a cheese enchilada for a meat enchilada on a multiple enchilada platter.  The Cadillac Margarita comes in a plastic cup and is made from swill and imitation lime swill. The guacamole shouldn't have been able to be bad (since it was made in front of us) but the guy forgot salt and pepper and hence it was immensely bland.  Sidenote: one of our party members passed out at the table immediately after consuming the above mentioned guacamole. I am 92% sure it was because she hadn't eaten all day but I want to leave open the possibility this place is poisoning it's guests because it wouldn't surprise me.  If the Paramedics or the Flamingo Security who responded to the above medical incident were Carlos n Charlie's staff this review would have more stars because their customer service was dramatically better than the actual employees.  As an alternative I recommend everywhere else in the world. Literally you could just knock on doors offering people money to cook you mexican food and I am certain the first person to accept you in would be able to cook you a finer meal with whatever they had on hand (and would likely agree to a much lower price) than this lousy embarrassment of a \"restaurant.\""}
{"text":"Terrible!  How can they screw up a chicken fajita salad?  Well they did by pouring some kind of vinegar & oil dressing all over it.  The lettuce and tomatoes were droopy and water logged.  Get rid of this place and get a good restaurant in there -- what an embarrassment!"}
{"text":"this place is bomb manager rafael gave us great service ...good vibe great music loved it!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here!  The first nickel and dime restaurant I have ever visited.  Way overpriced, average price is $16 per plate and you get very little.  Food is over cooked, hard, stale chips.  Server got my wifes order wrong twice.  The iced tea and iced water is from the tap (not purified).    I finally told the server we had to leave and needed the check.  $40 for a beer, fish tacos, iced tea, chips and salsa that all tasted bad!"}
{"text":"Place was great until I had to use the bathroom. The guy told me I had to go into the hotel to use the bathroom because the bathroom was \"flooded\"  damn guy lied because before that he said the section was closed off. You have to be kidding me.   Dont go here if it you spend a dime, local or not."}
{"text":"The meat was greasy and no flavor. For the price the quality of food was horrible! Even dollar tacos are better. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered the chilaquiles for breakfast & it was literally hot soggy chips and salsa  we were so hungry we ate what we could and ran as fast as we could"}
{"text":"AWFUL!! They used cheese whiz for the nacho's, the steak was chewy, and the drinks were water down.  One member in our party went into the bathroom to make himself puke after dinner."}
{"text":"Bad service. Salty guacamole. Salty shrimp. Dry chicken.  Had to wait and wait for our drink order to be taken and then to receive them.   Bar staff outside seemed to be having more fun than doing any actual work.   Simply shameful. I've been to the Carlos n Charlie's in LA MANY times and never had service this bad!!"}
{"text":"The 2 for 1 margarita special isn't a good deal, in my option.  It's not a good margarita, there's barely any alcohol, and they mark up the first one.  And when you want to get out of the place, it's hard to find somebody to take your money."}
{"text":"The place was packed at 2:00 on a Saturday afternoon.    We were seated, but it was a long time before we had a server stop by.   Frozen marguerites were half price, but on the rocks were not.  Disappointing.    We had the cheese dip appetizer which was decent but we waited forever...again. Placed our meal order of a chicken and cheese burrito and enchiladas.   The server said guacamole on the side and I said yes because I thought they would put it all over, but no, it is a $2 charge.   Annoying that I wasn't told.     Both meals were nice and hot, but lacked any sauce so they were extremely dry.  The Spanish rice was good  I am thinking that $75 for what we had was pricey.   The marguerites were $11 each. Ouch!  Overall, really not worth the money."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I came here on a Friday afternoon around 2pm. The place was pretty empty and the server seated us at a booth. We noticed immediately that there was something weird about the table--it was huge [we couldn't touch hands with our backs against the seats, which isn't conducive to conversations], it came up to the middle of my chest, and it curved. Boyfriend thought the table was just warped, but all the booths were like that! My silverware kept sliding off my plate and into the middle of the table, so we moved.   The food was fine. I wasn't like blown away by the burrito packed with cheese and veggies. Skip the guacamole--it's super oily. Our beers were served in giant margarita glasses, which I kinda liked.   The service wasn't great. She didn't come by very often and we never got water. It also took quite a while to get the bill.  We were back in here an hour later because Boyfriend's group of pals showed up. This time we were seated on the patio. The nachos are ridiculously huge, which seems like something that they would point out in the menu. They're definitely meant for sharing as an appetizer and not for a single person to sit down and eat! Haha, it was a mountain of chips, real cheese, nacho cheese, and meant. The 2-for-1 margaritas were decent [strawberry was VERY strong, but I couldn't taste much alcohol in the mango so perhaps it hid the flavor].   Our waitress didn't come by very often and we had to go chase after her to get more drinks and our bills. When one of the guys in the group went to go talk to a manager about it, he was given an it's-not-my-problem response.   Oh, and apparently this place turns into a weird night club. We sent a friend through [she reported back as it being partially filled with mostly dudes] and decided to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The wife had heard good things about Carlos n Charlies so we thought we would give it a try for dinner as we were staying at the Linq next door.  It was a bad decision.   We were not served any nachos and salsa.  The Chimichanga was not as good as something I can get at Taco Bell and cost $18.40. The biggie though was the cost of one 34 ounce Shock Top beer $18.20.      I definitely would not recommend this restaurant as there are many other better choices very close to this location."}
{"text":"Overpriced and food wasn't good! It was a wild place with all the going on with the employees dressing up going around giving free shots etc., but food was bad and pricey!"}
{"text":"Terrible air quality( even by Vegas standards ) . Long waits even with no lines. Not good for Mexican food ( even by Casino standards)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere a little on the high priced side if you go after happy hour. Not very busy when we went so don't know that you will need reservations.      We got chicken nachos  and you could use that as your meal because it was huge. Fajitas were a little on the small side with a little cup of guacamole and cups of sour cream.       When you are used to fajitas in Ohio (el jalape√±o ) no one will compare to quality and amount of food.        60 bucks for nachos and an order of fajitas with 1 beer.! Pictures say a 1000 words try going during happy hour I am sure the prices will be half of what they charge after.        Went to see x burlesque show, so this was a last minute decision. Don't know that I would choose this place over all the other great places in Vegas."}
{"text":"I haven't heard good things about the food, but since I didn't try it I wouldn't know.  The service was ridiculous though.  And I didn't like the drinks much better.  We stayed in the Flamingo for a week and we were on a trip with lots of co-workers so I ended up having more than one experience here even though under normal circumstances I wouldn't have been back after the first time.  We stopped by at the end of our first night in LV to grab one more drink with a friend before heading to our room and decided on frozen margaritas. ( Let me start with 3 important facts: 1) I LOVE margaritas. 2) I enjoy sour things so much that I will happily peel a whole lemon or grapefruit like its and orange and eat it with no sugar. 3) We had quite a bit to drink at this point and weren't in any state to be picky.)  The margaritas were so mouth-twistingly bitter and sour that none of the three of us could get one down.  The next time I came they had some sort of all yo can drink thing going on.  Problem was, no one that worked there knew the rules.  We were originally sold a line about how you can come and go as much as you want and bring your drinks.  But every time they fought us about it making up rules about needing to get a new cup and then rules about having to have the same cup.  On top of all that, the latin techno that was playing was so loud that we were all sitting around the table texting eachother because you couldn't hear the person right next to you even when they screamed at the top of their lungs.   Beware of this place because they wander through the casino trying to sell you on $20 all you can drink tickets."}
{"text":"I felt bad for our waitress who clearly had a 10+ table section and poor support staff. We ordered breakfast, didn't get our drinks forever (bartender was \"MIA\" in her own words) and then the food runner forgot the side dish.   Mediocre priced foods at best and understaffed."}
{"text":"I was scuuuuuured to buy the $30 for $15 because of the reviews but I did it anyway. Why not, it's Vegas!!   Got here around 4 on a Wednesday. Sat on the patio. Really nice atmosphere outside. Breezy and cool, yes even for Vegas. Our server came right away, we showed him our coupon and he told us our options. He allowed us to have 2 separate checks so we could get happy hour prices and also use the groupon for food. Cool beans.   We got the sampler for $31. There were 2 of us. Girls. Couldn't come close to finishing it. It wasn't great but it wasn't horrible either. Just your average Vegas Mexican food I suppose.   We each had 2 beers and were on our way! No complaints here! I'd go back but maybe just for drinks. If you go to eat, look for a coupon. Have fun!"}
{"text":"Great fun here! If you're staying at the Flamingo you have to eat here and come for the nightlife on the patio. If you aren't staying at the Flamingo, then still get here. Charlie and Cowin in the kitchen are amazing and Dave on the patio bar is the shiznit! The food is authentic and served with the utmost care. Order the guacamole and watch it be made right at you table or the bar. Nothing compares!"}
{"text":"We wanted to have a relaxing meal on Friday. So, we ventured into Carlos' n Charlie's as there was no queue in front of the restaurant.  We ordered the following: Enchilada Special Burger Special Lemonade  Total with tax and tip came to $38.00  Pros: Enchilada was very delicious. Portions were very generous. I am a sucker for Habanero salsa. Salsa had a kick to it (+1) Server was attentive and very informative.  Abundant seating, TV's to catch games. Lots of specials on booze as well as food.  Cons: None.  There was an employee taking pictures and scamming us for a Las Vegas memorabilia postcard. Against the Mrs's protest, I fell for the tourist trap. *Laughs*"}
{"text":"Avoid if possible. Especially if you are from Texas or understand what real Tex-Mex is supposed to taste like. This place is a tourist trap.   From charging for chips and salsa to their over-priced items, Carlos'n Charlies is a pit stop you will wish you had passed by. The only reason it would get any business at all is because of its location and the desperation of people to eat without walking too far.   Somehow I racked up a $75 bill here with NO alcoholic drinks. I walked with my stomach empty. I left with my wallet empty. It was not even good.   2 stars because my server was actually a helpful and kind guy.   In a place like Las Vegas that offers some of the best and most diverse cuisine on the planet, you are pretty stupid to eat at a place like this. Don't make the same mistake I did."}
{"text":"You can't even give this place a star. We went in there and took forever to get service. We ordered chips and cheese dip. The FDA needs to step in because that is NOT cheese. We got up and left immediately"}
{"text":"Great customer service and good food.  I'm outside on the padio watching the game, having a mango margarita and just devoured some chicken rolled tacos! So good! Great servers and what a great manager Mike. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I've got to admit this is a fun place but as far as Mexican food not! By far the WORST ENCHILADAS I've  ever eaten the beans were cold the food sat out in the window for a very long time it had already started to crust a bit. THE ONLY THING GOING FOR THEM IS THE AFTER HOUR CLUB, oh and the fresh guacamole is .  Other than this, it's a good spot to drink and laugh no food"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely HORRIBLE!  I wouldn't recommend anyone to go here \"after hours\". They currently have a deal in which you pay $20 for an open bar of cheap liquor.  Seems \"great\" right?  We got our first drink AFTER watching the bartender and their friends take shots! Got our first drink.. ok. Waited for the 2nd drink and another male bar tender was there, yet again... Taking shots with friends/coworkers, they make eye contact with the customers waiting for assistance and yet he continued to take another shots with friends/coworkers before being assisted. We were told there would be a variety of music but they only played old skoo hip hop. You make a suggestion for music, they'll play it Once to \"make you happy\" and then go back to what they  (bartender and co-workers) wanted to hear -- fuck what the customers want to hear or request! Absolutely HORRIBLE DRUNK BARTENDERS THAT IGNORE CUSTOMERS AND WOULD RATHER GET DRUNK THEMSELVES! Would NEVER recommend this to anyone for the nightlife. This place is VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst enchiladas I've ever had.  Tasted like hot sauce and salsa were the only flavors used.  Never again."}
{"text":"I can't believe I failed to write my review so long ago! The memories still leave me shuddering... bleh.  This place suuuucks. Food, service, prices, everything! The colorful, \"chaotic\" decor was what brought my friends, husband and I in on one not-yet-drunken afternoon for lack of more variety of places to eat in our hotel, and we were starving.  I immediately Yelped and was pretty terrified to eat here. I mean really, I think a restaurant actually has to work at it to get so many incredibly low ratings. Once seated we ordered one of those massive margaritas which my girlfriends shared (such a waste of money; the cup is shaped like a fatty goblet but is really hollowed out like a wine flute inside.. bye bye $$$).   I ordered what seemed to be the safest thing on the menu - a cheese quesadilla with guacamole ($11.90 + 2.00 for guac... this thing better be gourmet!). I can't remember what everyone else ordered but they all seemed to shoot for \"safer\" options as well. My top-dollar quesadilla, which was really just a couple flour tortillas with melted shredded cheese in between, arrived with no guac. I tried to flag our waitress down but she completely ignored us after our food was delivered.  Then we tried to flag her down again for another round of waters. Ignore, ignore, ignore - we got the attention of a busboy who said he'd tell her but she still never came.   Then they turned on that hokey cha cha slide song and tried to get everyone up, servers and patrons, to dance. Our waitress amazingly reappeared to try and drag me to dance and I kindly refused and asked, \"can I just get a water please??\" She ignored me and went to dance. I honestly could not believe her!  In the end we never got waters, I never got guac (and she attempted to charge me for it), and our waitress \"split the bill\" between me and my friends but charged some of their expensive margarita onto mine. When I pointed out the error she said I was wrong, and the bill was just fine. I was done fighting with her so we paid and left NO tip. I can count less than five times in my life I've done that but in this case it was well-deserved. We will NEVER go back"}
{"text":"This place has mediocre food and the service sucks. What do you expect it's at the Flamingo. Would not come here again."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food because after ten minutes of not being acknowledged at our tables, we got up and left.  Only about 20% of the tables were occupied."}
{"text":"Dark, dirty, and below average food, drinks, and service.     No wonder they were passing out happy hour cards and buy1, get1 offers.  They need to bring people into this shithole.    Taco bell would have been more authentic than the food they served.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"We just needed a place to eat STAT - after walking around hungover in Vegas for too long! Carlos N Charlies...why god why. So. Awful. IDK what everybody is saying about their small menu...because I experienced something totally different! To start, their menu has about 150 things on it - from Mexican to Chinese, I swear. Our waiter wasn't attentive and it was really hard to get his attention.   Another overpriced crappy place in Vegas."}
{"text":"You are in Vegas, you can find better service and food so don't settle on this place. Service was super slow and place was only half full. Maybe a good place to have a drink and watch a game, but find something else for food. My chimichanga was barely worth $5 much less the price they charge, as the chicken cubes  were sad and scarce. I went along with the group and checked Yelp as we sat down, we should have left but didn't. They try to offer guac with everything, you get a small and I mean small cup of guac that is not good at all."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon and we were staying at the Flamingo so we decided to check it out. We ate lunch there on our last day before catching our shuttle for the airport. We were seated right away. Service though was slooooooooow. We both ordered the shrimp burrito, it was good. We enjoyed our food but I would not of paid full price (had a groupon). I would only eat there again if it were out of desperation. Everything at the Flamingo is overpriced and gross."}
{"text":"Here for lunch and there was not many people in the restaurant.  There were 10 of us at lunch so good since we were all able to sit and enjoy the food and talk while there.  I started with a raspberry margarita and it was sweet like I prefer it to be and I really enjoyed the cocktail.  For my meal I opted for the Quesadilla Charlie's.  I have never seen a quesadilla so thick. These have chicken, carne asada, and chorizo with cheese.  It was delicious and I ate way too much of it, but enjoyed every bit of it.  I would go back to order it again today if I was closer now that I am thinking about them again! :-)  Our service was acceptable and attentive and we all enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"Looking for good Mexican food in las Vegas? Then don't come here. Once I was finally acknowledged by my server it took about another ten minutes for her to take my order.  I ordered the extremely overpriced carne asada burrito. They should call it a veggie burrito with a little bit of carne asada. For 20 it is a major rip off. If you want chips and salsa be prepared to pay 7.  Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Roaches!!! Visited this location over spring break! The place was mostly empty and we ordered drinks and apps (nachos & taquitos). When the food came out the portions were huge but barely luke warm. Just went with it because the wait/service was already so slow. Mid way thru two roaches ran across our booth. We jumped up (quietly since didn't want to make scene) and showed waitress. She moved use to new table leaving behind our water and a few things. Our appetite was gone at this point; disgusting. Paid $50 for food we couldn't eat. I emailed hotel and no response.   Carlos and Charlie's; this was last Monday 4/10. Exact time sent in PM"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times. Each time was fun for sure. This particular time was on a Sunday and was surprisingly very busy! We had Logan as a server and he rocked. The food took a bit to get out but it's understandable, evaluating the circumstances of how busy it was. I would have loved to meet Carlos and Charlie. Their salsa is mild but very flavorful. Whoo!"}
{"text":"We just got in to our hotel, starving, and dealing with lost items. We needed to eat and pronto and it Was the first place we saw. The food was alright and the drinks were EXPENSIVE. I would not say I will never eat there again, but I will make sure to check help prior again. That's how we learn people."}
{"text":"Large portions!! Husband had chimichanga and I had some chicken entree.  Both very good and kept us full from noon til bedtime."}
{"text":"Terrible! The service was so slow. Food was way too spicy. I ordered a taco salad and instead they brought me chicken tacos. Waiter rushed me the correct order then after. But sadly it was drenched with dressing. I got the dressing on the side plus a drenched salad! He took it off the bill and I spent the night starving. My husband said burrito was good but on the spicy side. This place lacks organization and is too pricey. Manager was MIA. We didn't ask for one but you can tell that they weren't there. The frozen margarita was way too tart and was presented in a beer glass. I couldn't even finish it. Waisted $$ on that one too. We tipped the waiter well regardless. But what a disappointment!"}
{"text":"One of the worst places ever in Vegas. Sent the food back and it came back barely better. 14.50 margaritas with well booze. Really!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a bit pricey and the food quality is poor. They charge $6 for chips and salsa  This wouldn't be so bad if the salsa was fresh and the chips weren't stale. My husband and I shared a chimichanga plate. It was just okay. My pina colada came straight from a ready made mix from a machine. Not good. Our waiter was attentive and a nice guy ( not his fault the food sucks)This was our first and last time coming to this place. If you enjoy good tasting food; don't come here. This place needs some major improvements!!"}
{"text":"Coming into the restaurant it had a great view. Nice outdoor bar with cooling and twinkling lights.  Anytime I go out to eat I read yelp reviews and every single one was bad. But we had already sit down so we decided to stay and eat. The chimi was recommended by the waiter so we ordered. Very heavy. Lots of onions. Expensive and drinks are basically water. Welcome to Vegas"}
{"text":"This is a good place to go if you want to simply have fun and party. It's an anything goes Mexican restaurant. Located inside the flamingo casino. They have a great deal of 4 hours of open bar where you get a selection of frozen margaritas, Busch light, and you also get an entree of choice. Great times here."}
{"text":"The sign outside said $5 mimosas from 8am - 12pm. Sat down and was told alcohol was not sold until 10am. Our waitress seemed less then enthusiastic about our experience. Won't be coming back and food wes ok - nothing special."}
{"text":"The food was seriously gross AND way overpriced. I am a pretty shitty cook, and I honest to god could have made better tacos. Plus, as we all know, a day of drinking can make somewhat questionable fare (Del Taco) taste like ambrosia of the gods - and yet, 10 beers deep, the food still tasted disgusting. Cold meat/no salsa on the tacos, wilted lettuce & canned corn on the salad, and to top it off a $60 check?? I think not, sir. Spend your money on \"manbuckets\" of Coors Light at the flamingo pool ($48 for 12 beers, hayyyy)."}
{"text":"This is my new fave spot in Vegas! They are located at the Flamingo and they offer happy hour daily-- two for drink specials on margaritas and beer.  I enjoy Mexican food so I am happy we can dine here. They just started serving breakfast and their omelets are so yummy!! They do open early and close late. And you have to try their ceviche and guacamole super good!!  Their patio is nice to relax, eat, drink and listen to music."}
{"text":"We were suckered into checking out Carlos' n Charlie's on a Thursday evening by one of the guys walking around the hotel handing out wristbands. He told us that we would get in for free with an open bar. Awesome, right?! Well, the wristband was good for the cover, but we had to pay $20 per person to get a red solo cup that was good for four drinks only.  We went in expecting to get out money's worth and were really disappointed with the crowd. Sure, it was Thursday, but there were maybe 20 people inside. Whatever.  We went to the bar and got decent service from a flashy bartender with a whistle who poured essentially a red solo cup full of vodka. Awesome, right?! Yeah, if you reallllllyyyy love vodka. We couldn't have finished four drinks unless we wanted to end up in the ER. So it really ended up to be a $20 cup of vodka. Also, the DJ was just awful. Occasionally he would play a song that people knew and would dance to, but he was sloppy and the music was terrible. I think there are many better places in Vegas to spend your money!"}
{"text":"The first & last time I will eat here. Service was slow, the manager finally took our order and said \"go ahead complain, it won't get you anywhere\". Everyone's food was warm, but mine was stone cold."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place. We stayed at Flamingo and passed by this restaurant aka bar everyday. One night, we were approached by a promoter to check this place out for open bar $20. We had a long and tiring day and decided to have a drink there instead o walking out in the hot weather to other places. Well, when we were at the bar, it looks like they are understaffed and it takes forever for us to get our drinks. Music is too loud and I don't enjoy myself at all. After 15mins, decided to leave after one drink. Can't wait to get out!"}
{"text":"This place isn't as bad as some of the reviews are saying. Think of this place as an Applebee's or Chilis with a nightlife scene. The staff was very friendly and the food was good. The prices actually are comparable to ANY family style restaurants. Check this place out and see for yourself that it's a pretty cool and different scene for the strip. Also their $20 wristband all you can drink menu is off the hook.......! SHAAAAAOOOOOW!!!"}
{"text":"Cold, stale tortilla chips, tasteless guacomole, old chicken enchiladas... Awful waste of time and money! Waitress was very nice!"}
{"text":"Don't come here for the Mexican food. Don't come here for the awesome service. DO come here for a rollicking good time.  My sweetie pop and I had a Groupon, and we both LOVE Mexican food, so we decided to stop by after seeing the 4pm comedy magic show with Nathan Burton. We sat out on the patio near the outdoor bar. The first thing I noticed about the menu is that this place is EXPENSIVE!  Our server--Britany--was exceptionally adorable. She seemed genuinely helpful and wanted to ensure that our meal was done correctly, but she was quite \"green\" as a server. We placed our order for an entree salad as our appetizer and our food order at the same time. By the time we had taken 3 bites from our GINORMOUS salad the food runner came out with our plates. I protested and let him know (wasn't it obvious?!) that we hadn't even begun to finish our salad . He said he would bring the food back later, and he came back not more than 5 minutes later and tried to server our plates again. Really?! Yeah, we were still eating the salad, he could see that, but he still looked bewildered as to why we didn't want our entrees at that point in time.  So, finally,  another lady brings out our food, and lo! I behold the world's smallest $15 chicken burrito! Egad, I asked for a \"wet\" burrito, and they put the sauce on the bottom of the plate. Hmm, since when did wet plate = wet burrito? I'll never know.  Sweetie Pop ate the chicken enchiladas with a combination of the red and the green sauce. Salsa verde is my favorite, but theirs isn't done well here. The red sauce was much better: spicy and delicious. I've NEVER been hungry after eating an entree sized burrito, but my tiny little chicken burrito was downright pathetic. Who puts CUBED chicken in a burrito anyway? Carlos and Charlie's does.  We were attended by a number of servers, the manager and food runners. However, when we asked the same genius (insert sarcasm here:_____________) who kept bringing our food out prematurely for some water with lemons, he proceeded to bring out one glass of water and a saucer with exactly ONE, according to Sweetie Pop,  \"sad, sorry, sucked on lemon\" on it. Britney promptly corrected his error (after all there were TWO of us, so why not bring each of us  some water and lemons?) and she apologized for the series of food service mishaps.  Ultimately, I would recommend this place for the giant nachos (I saw them on someone else's table)  and the beverages. Thursday is Ladies Night, and ladies get all you can drink frozen margaritas. Bonus! After dinner we danced to the few line dances, and had a good time before calling it a night.  Carlos and Charlie's is a place for fun, not food! Those nachos looked pretty exciting though, and as my girlfriend once told me, \"It's hard to F**K up nachos.\" Too true.  p.s. Contrary to the sign on the way into the building advertising Carlos and Charlie's their happy hour has NOT been \"extended until further notice.\" It only goes until 6pm...Another disappointment since we arrived at 6:04pm. *sigh*"}
{"text":"This place is seriously disgusting and grossly overpriced. The fish tacos consisted of a few fried fish sticks with cabbage thrown on top for $17. AND it didn't come with any sides either for that price, no rice, no beans, nothing...are you kidding me? Don't come here planning on getting chips and salsa when you sit down at the table because that's extra. The quesadilla was the worst I've ever had. The tortilla was SOAKED in grease and there were very few fillings. The tortilla soup didn't come with any chicken at all, just corn, beans, and what looked and tasted like canned broth - DISGUSTING.  Everything is completely overpriced it's not even funny. This place will be out of business in a few months. Gross."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience from beginning to end! Our server, Gelbert, made it that way! He was so attentive and joined right in on our celebrations!  The food was delicious. Chicken quesadillas, burritos, chunky salsa, Cadillac margaritas; all to perfection! We will definitely make this a \"go to place\" on our return trips to Vegas and no doubt, we will request Gelbert! 5 stars all the way"}
{"text":"Just a warning, their \"open bar for $25\" is actually shitty well drinks that you could never get your money's worth of! And they don't give refunds. Do not go here! It's horrible and super shady!! If I could give 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"Staff were friendly, service was a bit slow for being not very busy, but the food was okay for two of us four.  Two of us had cold food and the chimichanga was not only cold it was soggy.  The waitperson disappeared so I gave in and ate it after ten minutes.  Overpriced for the quality and what we got."}
{"text":"I just got back from Vegas today and a bunch of us went there last night and had a nasty dinner!! Took 15 minutes for us to get our drinks then another 8 to order food!!  Pretty pricy for food especially food That was so bland!!We ordered chips and salsa that we never got and tortilla soup that we never got and I had 2 small short hairs in my steak and chicken tacos(they were gross, no flavor) and they came and took it away promptly, told me I wouldn't be charged for it( of course) and bought me a beer! My friends all ate their food because they were drunk but they all hated it too! I will never go there again and I hope I can save others from having the same experience as us!!!"}
{"text":"No matter how hungry you are, or how much your feet hurt, do yourself a favor and keep walking past this noisy excuse for a Mexican restaurant, located pretty close to the Flamingo front desk.   It offers overpriced, mediocre Americanized food...with a small discount if you show your Total Rewards card. Alas, the savings did not help. It was a bomb on so many levels.   Service: our server was sweet but slow and managed to get so much wrong. I ordered a Pepsi, got a diet, and despite my almost empty glass and her eagerness to refill my husband's water at least 4 times, I never got a refill. Given that the soda was $3.50, ugh.   She forgot to bring my soup and when we reminded her, she smiled and said she would take it off the check. Boo.   My chicken fajita salad was tasty. Basic, no complaints. Hubby had BBQ shrimp and did not like the spicy sauce or the bacon garnish.   We splurged and bought the chips and salsa...nothing like a paper bag of stale chips and jarred salsa to convince us we'd made a grande mistake. The noisy atmosphere and thumping soundtrack sort of topped things off.   One of the worst meals I've ever had in Vegas...live and learn."}
{"text":"Good \"American\" style Mexican food. I say that because there isn't the Hispanic music or even chips and salsa. BUT our food was great with large portions and yummy sauces.  I had the chicken flautas and my husband had the chimichanga.  (See picture)  Our server, Shajuan, was very attentive and helped with recommendations from the menu.    The atmosphere was lively without being too loud.  We ate outside next to the water fountain outside if the Flamingo hotel.   I would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"A 12 oz. of Dos Equis for $8? The only reason we went here was to meet some friends who were staying in the Flamingo. I told the bartender the last time I paid that much for a beer was when I was drinking a craft beer. It was a Ballast Point Sculpin to be exact. Then I asked him why this bar does not offer more selection than Coors, Budweiser, Corona and Dos Equis and he said most people prefer these beers. Really? The only reason they prefer these beers is due to the lack of selection at this place and other places on The Strip. I told him he should offer craft beer to differentiate this place from other places. Apparently he was not open to the suggestion. With that attitude and way of thinking,  I will be shocked if this bar is still around when I return to Vegas. Adios Carlos' n Charlie's."}
{"text":"Terrible food and service whatever. Wasted my money I should have just played the slot machine or the blackjack table"}
{"text":"Second day in Vegas and I slept in after a late late night. When I woke up I was in the mood for some lunch. I had seen this place on the way to my room the first night and I wanted to try it so I decided that was the time. I went in and was greeted right away by the host. I have some pictures with him. He was totally adorable and his accent was so cute. He was very friendly and made me feel welcome. He got me something to drink right away. My waitress was also very attentive and friendly.   I ordered the shrimp tacos and I have to say they were very good. I can see from the other reviews that the food leaves something to be desired but in my opinion the shrimp tacos are a good choice. They were actually pretty big and had alot of flavor. I had to get a to go box because I couldn't finish all of them. I also ordered a cup of tortilla soup. That, unfortunately, was not good at all. It had no flavor and the menu said it had cheese, well where was it because I sure didn't taste any. Tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups and I have had it in many different places but this one was probably the worst. I will admit that the food is very pricy but at the same time Vegas restaurant prices are always inflated.   My overall experience having lunch there was good and I will be back.   I had another experience here at night. They had a 2 for 1 drink special going on and I just kind of wandered in at the spur of the moment. There was a group of Puerto Rican people there dancing. I went in to see what that was about and next thing I know they are pulling over to them to dance with them. I ended up with a margarita in each hand and dancing with these people all night. I had a blast. They kept the drinking coming and the music going. If you come with some fun people this place can be a fun place to party at. The margaritas were not the best I ever had but they were sufficient. I was more caught in the dancing."}
{"text":"AMAZING SPOT!!!!!!!  I had the greatest time as soon as I went through the door. My friend and I went to others place around the area but we kept coming back to Carlos'n Charlies because the ambiance was wonderful and service was over the top. The staffs are super friendly and welcoming. The restaurant manager Gordo went above and beyond to make sure we had a great time...he was attentive entertaining and knowledgeable constantly checking on our table and making sure service was impeccable. We highly recommend this place to anyone who  down to have an amazing time in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"**Open Bar Review Only** 1/1/17 2AM. We were walking around New Year's Day on the strip when two guys from Carlos and Charlie waived us down and told us to check out the open bar night to open up the New Years. It was $25 per person and you had 1hr open bar. So we walked over to the Carlos and Charlie and the music was going but we couldn't see inside. Screw it we decided to go in. As you walk in they hand you a plastic Dixie cup and tell you to hold on to it or there will be a fee for a new cup.  That was weird as it was. We walk in and there is about 30 people just standing around listening to the DJ. The dance floor was all wet from people spilling there drinks on it. The reason why I gave it one star and wish I could've gave it negative stars was because of what they were serving behind the bar. All the bottles behind the bar were bottom shelf generic imitation bottles. The worst of the worst. All the bottles on the back shelf were not being served. They weren't part the open bar. They had a few beers on tap. I asked for IPA and they told me NO. I asked for Bud Light and they said No. So I told him to give me whatever was included in the open bar. Disgrace of bartender come back with Natural Ice. Within that one hour of being there we decided we had enough. Dump of a place could keep the money, they needed it. About to walk out when security stops everyone who's leaving because a female slipped and busted her face open. Since there was blood everywhere we had to wait till they cleaned it up to exit. Place is a dump don't go here."}
{"text":"I didn't heed the warnings of so many others and I paid the price. The service was ok, but the food was awful. Half my group had to stop at a certain point it was so bad. And the prices!?!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?! $15-20 a plate for awful Mexican food. So fail. Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"We got there around 8:00PM and sat outside. Was very loud, making any conversation a shouting match.   Food is Mexican/American and pretty good. Very slow service (waitress giving menu, taking order, bartender bringing drink, getting food and paying bill. Don't go here if you have a tight schedule.   Drink was just OK. Bartender was juggling drinks and putting on a show for patrons, perhaps that slowed things down?"}
{"text":"So this place was ran out of late night servers. My group of 7 had to order at the Bar. Then once I ordered the menu switched to the late night.  l opted for a shrimp salad"}
{"text":"Oh the manager just left a nice little comment about my review. Super classy woman and seems like a great leader. You should be embarrassed and fired from your job."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a Monday.  Shame on me for not checking Yelp first before deciding to eat here.  I think Carlos 'n Charlie's is a nighttime weekend drinking spot, but definitely not a middle of the day lunch spot.  It was fairly empty, which is fine, but there was nothing there to make me want to recommend it to anyone.  The young hostess in the front was not particularly friendly nor welcoming.  Angie M. was our server.  She was a little gruff but friendly and attentive.  She made the guacamole at our table.  It was good but it just needed more salt.  Easily fixed.  I liked that she asked if we wanted the jalapenos in the guacamole (I didn't).    I settled for the cheese enchiladas with red sauce.  They were just okay.  Not horrible, but okay.  JAS had the burger and I don't recall if he liked it or not.  It was just one of those places where I wish we had decided to have lunch somewhere else."}
{"text":"The wait was only about 10 minutes, however there was no reason there should have been a wait, there were about 20 empty tables.   The food was less than average and more than average price.   And it took over 25 minutes.    We won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was horrible. The white male that wears a ball player cap during the evenings kept ignoring None White People. Bigotry and racist has no place in America anymore.  But when the Hispanic guy came to work it was a lot better."}
{"text":"Having already purchased a living social deal for bottomless drinks and an entree, reading the reviews made me worried, but hey, it's already paid for, how bad can it be. Well prepare yourselves ladies and gentleman. It's bad. The drinks weren't terrible, the service was pretty good but wow, the food. Yuck. What wasn't burnt was flavourless. I really can't think of a reason to recommend this place. Don't trust a Mexican restaurant that charges you for chips and salsa.   The service staff were friendly, polite and attentive but the quality of the food just lets this place down."}
{"text":"Terrible. The nachos were good, everyone else in the group hated their meal. The manager was very quick to comp off most of our lunch. Don't go. Ever."}
{"text":"We got breakfast , I had the 2-2-2 and everything was cooked perfectly to my liking . The service was quick and they had 5$ mimosas and bloody Mary's ! Our service was fun and our meal was decently priced for being in a casino."}
{"text":"So far management is completely unprofessional and disgusting. Coco supposedly the manager on duty is so unprofessional he argues and yells at customers what happened to the customer is always right. The only good thing about the whole night was bartender Corey! He was on point my drink was always full. I didn't even have to ask."}
{"text":"We were wanting Mexican food and this place was located in the hotel where we were staying....ideal we thought.  It was absolutely terrible!!!  Service was bad and food and drinks totally over-priced.  I got a chicken chimi and the chicken was spoiled.  I took one bite and literally gagged.  My husband is a chef and smelled it and immediately knew it was rotten.  I lost my appetite so did not re-order.  Husbands tacos were tasteless. They did not charge us for my meal but our bill still totaled $50.  A total disaster!!"}
{"text":"I wish I can post a negative star.  This place is awful!  My husband ordered a Cadillac margarita which was over loaded with sweat and sour mix.  Our appetizer came out after our dinner arrived.  I took one bite of my chicken burrito and spit it out because the chicken was ice cold.  My husbands carne asada burrito looked like it had all the left over greasy meat inside.  Needless to say we called the manager over.  He seemed irritated that we were unhappy with our food, comped the dinners and margarita, but still charged us for the appetizer which we didn't even eat!  Don't waste your time or money at this place.  Go to Margaritaville instead!"}
{"text":"Clubby kind of place, especially for 5pm dining. Guy used a flash light to make a strobe light affect - Extremely tacky!  Plus, he was shining it in people's eyes, such as mine and I was clear across the room.  Waitresses stop & dance, so if you need service quickly, it will be hard to grab them at that time.  The chips and salsa were awesome!  However, it was too bad that it was not free w/dining.  The fajitas didn't really have any special or different flavoring.  It was kinda bland.  Overall experience was ok.  Would recommend this place more for dining before going to a club or another bar atmosphere.  We took our 2 year old son, not the greatest place for kids, but in some cases think the entertainment was a bit of a distraction-could go either way.  Pros:  -Chips, Salsa  -music, dancing, noise can be good for kids - distraction  -Good place before going out - good party kinda atmosphere    Cons:  -Very loud  -Strobe light effect with a flashlight  -Can be bad for family  -not good for business meetings or discussion  -wait staff not very quick and stop and dance  -chips/salsa and guacamole took a long time to bring out - have to pay for chips/salsa (not included)  -More pricey than most places  -Not conveniently located if you are driving to the Flamingo - parking there sucks and walking to restaurant is further   If you are looking for more of a bar atmosphere before going out and getting some drinks maybe even chips/salsa, this may be a good place.    4 people with 2 year old = $100/dinner price (did not include drinks)  -2 hamburgers  -chips and salsa -guacamole  -1 Fajitas beef/chicken combo (shared by 2) with shrimp -side of corn  -side of veggies   =little pricey   Groupon helped and not sure if we would go back w/out it!"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst service ever. The hostess took way too long to sit us, and was not friendly at all. After being seated, we waited for 15 minutes for our waitress to approach us and at least acknowledge us. Our waitress just kept walking by us, to talk to the hostess. Never once, did she look our way. We finally grew tired of being ignored and walked out. Please to teach your staff proper etiquette. This incident happened 7/23/17 around noon."}
{"text":"Service was horrible.Burger was below average.Bun crumbled when you cut it. Wasn't busy. Eat elsewhere"}
{"text":"A Mexican restaurant that can't make good beans should have you running for the door. If possible, this place would receive negative stars.    The service was far from great.  The food was mediocre at best.  The salad wasn't fresh (found a limpy brown piece).  They weren't busy at all yet they failed to send someone to our table to make the guacamole as described in the menu. The BBQ chicken was served cold; when told the chicken was cold, they merely heated up the same piece. (My food [chimichanga] was also not so hot, but instead of telling them I just stopped eating because it wasn't that good anyway) Oh, and one of the plates were dirty.  My hunni was immensely disappointed :( We felt a bit deceived because the hostess that showed us to our table was nice and friendly but I guess customer service doesn't reflect the quality of food. All in all, $60 at Carlos & Charlies = a crappy meal.  We had to make up for it by eating a wonderful dinner, so we went to Olives, at the Bellagio, which was delish! Review coming soon :)"}
{"text":"I had a couple of friends of mine that came into town for my birthday and my unexpected engagement. I ordered the grilled chicken caesar salad which was good , my fiance ordered the chimichanga to which he was pleased with . We also had the cheese dip which was GREAT, our friends had the Platter and it was so much food that two grown men to be precise were not able to finish the dish. The food was good service was good and the food order was correct as well as table maintenance including the evident teamwork when our servers co-worker delivered the food.      We had a great experience with with waiter as well as the manager Ian Dyer who went over and beyond as well as managing to regain my trust and assurance that we will return. When we told the waiter we had a discount for restaurant.com at the end of the meal. He sent over another guy who I assumed to be the floor manager on duty who was completely rude to me. (his attire was a black shirt with black pants). When I showed him the discount that I was wanting to apply to our check via resteraunt.com he instructed me to \"stop yelling at him\" when I was simply trying to apply the discount. When he left the table and returned he then corrected us that we could not use our \"Groupon\" on the check. This I could understand if I were to use a Groupon it would make sense rather than restaurant.com discount that I was trying to apply to the check."}
{"text":"Amazing place ! I was with a bar crawl and they were happy to serve us. The waiters were very attentive and food is amazing ! I strongly recommend this location for the great service and great food !"}
{"text":"We really got duped! It's hard for me to imagine worse food than the garbage this place is dishing out. The service was also pretty lackluster, and the atmosphere made me feel kinda sad. I understand I'm going to pay a lot more for a meal because of where I am, but I expect an attempt at quality. Whoever is responsible for this is a true scam artist."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday party. Reserved a table for 20 and everyone showed. Ordered appetizers and drinks. We had the perfect waiter Jason who took such good care of all of us. He helped out with figuring out the bill. They even let us bring in our own cake."}
{"text":"5/6/17  Server Chris  We came in a day after Cinco de Mayo.  Although we have walked past here dozens of times on our past trips we never ate here. We love reading Yelp reviews and everyone's experience can be different.   My wife has been to the Carlos N Charlies at Acapulco, but she wasn't expecting the same results as she is from there :)  I first presented my coupon which they said no problem and took our order. I opted for the 20 oz Cadillac margarita. This had a great flavor and left me with a slight buzz.  My wife had a virgin Pina colada, not sure if this was machine made or just a perfect blended result.    She opted for the Mole Enchiladas and I had the carna asada tacos.   The carna asada tacos had a lot of meat on them. More than the photos from CNC. I liked the flavor and they were very filling. They were better than I was expecting.  My wife said the mole was very good. Mole is a serious business to her :) She liked the enchiladas as well. But said the mole made the meal. The prices were on point with what other Mexican places on the strip charge. Just have to be used to the Strip prices :)  The waiter was nice and let us know this is also a club at night. We may go back for the club in July! Thanks for having us!"}
{"text":"Great food and great fun. They have such a great staff that really makes the customers feel wanted. If you love to have fun while you eat this is the place. We had the BBQ shrimp and the Parmesan chicken and both were excellent. Music can be a little to loud and the whistles are very annoying."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere good food and kid friendly. We would definitely come back! Only thing I didn't care for was the habanero salsa had no flavor but was definitely hot."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. I walked up to the outside bar with my friend and had to greet our bartender \"Kush\" since he clearly had no interest in assisting us. When asked about happy hour drinks he was extremely standoffish. Once we received our margaritas the bill came to $16 for 2 (2 for 1)  but their margaritas are watered down & definitely not worth the money. After sitting here for 30 minutes & noticing how friendly \"Kush\" was to other patrons the only common denominator was that we were African American & everyone else he greeted & checked in on was White. He didn't even look at us one time! Sitting with two empty cups at a bar & not being asked how was it, do you need anything else, or anything at all is not something you get from this place. Definitely bring your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ok the food here is not that great really but the atmosphere was really fun and the drinks were great! People were dancing (including the staff). The music was great and up beat. The staff seemed to enjoy their job laughing and talking with everyone whether they were their customer or not. It was very fun and comfortable. Our food came very timely despite all the activity, we were not neglected at all by our waiter who was very busy with other customers and entertaining at the bar.   I would totally recommend this place for a fun couple shots and snacks."}
{"text":"Came here today for the holiday weekend and the bartenders were amazing. I absolutely love the atmosphere and the enviornment. Both bartenders treated us with great hospitality and are very humble. A must go for a Vegas trip!!! If you dont come here you miss out on the fun!!!"}
{"text":"Cannot speak for normal operating hours, but not a good choice if you wish to dine late night.   Small, over priced menu.  Blaring and crappy club music.  Seated at the outdoor bar. (A little cold) Bartender did not seem to want me there.   I left. And I'm hungry. Do not recommend, at least for late night eating."}
{"text":"The food was really good, but the service was horrible for a non-busy time. I got the carne asada tacos with guacamole, which were delicious, but it took my family almost an hour to get our food from the time we sat down at our table! Then it took about 20 minutes after we ate to get our checks! If the service was better, I would've really enjoyed this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was the worst food I have had in a long time! My Veggie bowl was flavorless with boiled vegetables thrown in a bowl with WHITE rice. Where is the Mexican rice? Nasty! Our Mango margaritas supposedly had a shot in them but they too were weak and gross. The manager said she would discount our tab but she really didn't! Don't waste your time here!!"}
{"text":"First off, our waitress, who's name was Vanesa with 1 \"S\" sucked, sad to say... She literally took forever to walk over to us every time.  We ordered chips and salsa but she lagged so terribly, we had to cancel the order.  So we came here during happy hour and got the Margaritas, buy one get one free.  It tasted like juice.  My friends and I wanted to send it back to the kitchen.  We also ordered enchiladas and it was not good at all.  What a disgrace.  And you would think having a Mexican name in the restaurant name and hispanic servers would give this place credit.  Nope!"}
{"text":"Great food with the exception of the Fried ice cream.  It was horrible.   Do not order that. Service was very attentive and good."}
{"text":"Horrible.. please do yourself a favor and eat your poker chips before you dare to eat their tortilla chips. Just plain bad. I understand Americanized Mexican food, but this doesn't even cut that low grade. Bland, boring .. served less than hot. And far too expensive for what it is. The queso dip was cold - no flavor. We tried to dress it up by adding the salsa, but the salsa just made it colder (it lumped) and more blah.!! The quesadilla was supposed to have carne asada , chorizo and chicken...well, you fooled me. Just stay away. How can you make tasteless chorizo - seriously.  Only saving grace, the waiter (poor guy) was actually a good guy."}
{"text":"I had the chimichanga and it was good but a little on the cooler temperature side. Other issue was when we asked for refill on water it took a long time to get. A little chintzy on salsa."}
{"text":"Horrible Chips from the Super Market \"mark down\" aisle along with cheap bottled salsa that you are over charged for??? E Gads!! The Worst of the Worst of dining in Las Vegas. I could Go On and ON about the terrible food....... PLEASE RECONSIDER your dining choice.   We foolishly didn't read the reviews prior to choosing this establishment.  D√©cor looks cheap and dirty. $16 for a crap chicken burrito. Waitress was attentive-But Cook was pokey getting things prepared in a timely manner. We were disappointed in everything, except the Diet Pepsi. The Place Being empty during the lunch hour should have been a Bright Red Warning Light."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good, but the service was only okay. We were there at 2pm and it was pretty busy, but they only had one server on. This poor woman was trying to serve 9 or 10 tables by herself, which wasn't her fault, but it made things move slow. We had to ask for our chips and salsa multiple times, and getting drink refills was a whole process. I think it would have been a better experience if they have more people working, but it was slow and only okay for us."}
{"text":"If you are looking for ugly people, disgusting food and cheap alcohol, this is your spot."}
{"text":"We have had the best experience ever!! We left Mesa to come over here because we heard it was so much better!! Roberto is an amazing server and we are so happy he got to take care of us! Juan is the best guacamole maker as well!!"}
{"text":"If we weren't staying at the Flamingo, I don't think we would have gone to this place.  Nothing good, nothing bad, but the chain could have been plopped into Minneapolis or South Dakota.  Typical Mexican chain and everything had that corporate taste.  I suppose most go for the showboating by the bartenders, but there just was not anything memorable about my meal."}
{"text":"This place has a indoor or out door patio option. I choose to sit outside and enjoy the weather. It had some coverings so the sun wasnt blazing right on you. There was a pretty decent size bar outside as well with seats that looked like various sexy legs. I thought this was fun and a cool picture opportunity. It was breakfast time when I went service was fast and there was plenty of open tables. This place is connected to the Flamingo hotel for reference.  For the food I got a breakfast burrito with potatoes. It was average breakfast food. They also had five dollar Bloody Mary's and Mimosas. I tried the blood mary. Nothing fancy served in a plastic cup but not bad again average. I'd say it's worth a try if your staying at the flamingo or close by but nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food, it was good enough.  1 star for the underhanded pricing schemes and crappy overpriced margarita's.  Beware everything is an extra charge: cheese, guacamole, chips and salsa.  They will not inform you of these extra charges up front but they will offer them to you as if they are free.   The surprise comes when you get the bill.   I think they are trying to be another Senior Frogs with loud music and servers who break out into line dances occasionally.  Avoid this place, it's lame."}
{"text":"The staff is great but the food is mediocre save for the ceviche. I'll talk about that in a second. So. I order a margarita on the rocks. This is a Mexican restaurant. On the STRIP. Yeah, it comes out looking like Mt. Dew and tasting like sadness. They also have margarita slurpee machines and I'd probably have been better off going that way.   The food was your generic churned out Mexican. Think... well, the \"Mexican\" dishes at places like Chili's.   They get two stars because the ceviche was fantastic. I couldn't believe it came from the same place! As someone who has made ceviche at a fine dining restaurant, I know my ceviche, and it was spectacular. Lots of avocado, which is great. Even my husband, who isn't really a foodie, commented that the ceviche looked strikingly different from all the other dishes.  Bottom line: order the ceviche and stick with Dos Equis."}
{"text":"To be honest, I'v only been here after a long day of..uhm... having a good time in Las Vegas..so my review may not be that accurate. The service does seem a bit slow, other than that, I got no issues with the place. The do have an outdoor patio that is quite nice at night. Looking at other reviews, don't come here sober... you will not have a good time. I mean.... some people don't seem to like this place very much."}
{"text":"Not bad for a cheap restaurant inside a casino!  Beans seemed canned.....but it was acceptable.  Waitress was a delight!  Drinks took a while to come by....may or may not return."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever seen so many bad reviews! I can't say I disagree, but our experience was a little better then 1 Star.  My girlfriend and I stopped in here late on our first night in Vegas. We started with Margarita's and an order of Guacamole. The Margarita's were OK, but the Guacamole was the best thing we had all night. It was made fresh to order right in front of us. Our entree's were below average, even for a chain Mexican place. According to the menu, my Cheese Burrito was supposed to be filled with Cheddar and Jack Cheese with veggies. What it was was a Tortilla filled with onions and green pepper's with barely any cheese in it at all.  My girlfriend ordered the Chicken Enchiladas in Red Salsa. She summed up the Meh of this place perfectly after tasting my Burrito. She said that both our dishes tasted like they came out of the same pot.  Pretty sad when you consider how different our entree's should have been.    Our service was OK, but confusing. Our Server's seemed to switch about one third of the way through our meal and then the first Server reappeared when our check came out. They are wheelchair accessible, but I can't see ever coming back here unless it's to sit at the bar, have a couple drinks and order some Guacamole."}
{"text":"Roxi was wonderful. She was helpful, efficient, and personable. The food was good and ok priced though a little smaller on the portion size. The main reason for only 3 stars is a staffing issue. With only one server for the whole inside restaurant there is just not enough help. This made service seem slow - not the fault of our server."}
{"text":"If I could give half a star I would. Just left this place because the chips tasted old and they were cold. And the salsa was from a jar. We ordered two margaritas and sent one back because it tasted horrible. The wait staff was slow, rude and unfriendly. I will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! If I really got into what happened here I would be writing for hours, pretty much they were understaffed so the manager brought free chips and salsa to everyone, I asked for no onions on my tacos, it took 30 min to get new tacos, might I mention I got the wrong tacos when they brought them. My friends food was cold, oh and they comped my food cause they felt bad.... It was ridiculous  never going back"}
{"text":"Environment was fun and enjoyed that there was outdoor seating. We went for lunch. It was quite pricey for a weekday lunch. I understand it's Vegas but there should still be a lunch option. Prices seemed too high for the quality of food. it reminded me of Don Pablo's or Chi Chi's but those restaurants prices are closer to the quality of the food. Kind of disappointed in the selection as well. Most appetizers were the same price as entrees."}
{"text":"Worst food I have ever tasted. We ordered the appetizer sampler so we could try several different items. Some food was hot but mostly lukewarm. The wings looked and tasted terrible. The rest was just so-so. Definitely not a place to visit again"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever I definitely recommend this place staff is very nice and friendly and food was very very good , I had a great experience definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Carlos 'n Charlie's is located inside of the Flamingo Hotel and Casino. It's your Americanized Mexican food establishment. The food isn't authentic Mexican food at all, but the taste isn't that horrible. So why the 2 stars? The portions are too small, the price is too high and the service isn't the best.   At first our waiter was pretty chill, but after taking our order we didn't see too much of him after. I guess the only good thing was that he gave us a margarita for free since he made a mistake.   Food: I ordered the chicken enchiladas with rice. Everything was seasoned pretty well, but I wish it had more of a kick to it. Also, I honestly could have probably ate 2-3 plates since the portion really wasn't that large...  Overall, I'm glad I tried Carlos 'n Charlie's one time, but I most likely won't be back. I'd rather spend $20+ on a meal that will actually fill me up."}
{"text":"Carne Quesadilla was great. Carne nacho was huge and good. Fajitas were good not sizzling like most but still good. They come take your photo and sell them to you. I loved it and bought one. Overall was completely satisfied. Prices were high but everything is on the strip. I would go back."}
{"text":"I really have to say don't go here. A couple of our party stopped in to get buy 1 get 1 happy hour drinks, then decided to hang out and get food. Our server was nice, but completely overwhelmed. It took 20 minutes between when we were able to place a drink order then a food order because he was nowhere to be found. Once we had ordered our food, it took almost 45 minutes to arrive, which tells me the kitchen was slammed as well. Twice we had someone attempt to deliver the incorrect order to our table, which ended up being for the tables around us.  The food was just ok - shrimp quesadilla was a little undercooked (cheese not completely melted) and very overpriced at $16. The habanero sauce is legit though - super hot! That was nice. The \"big mama\" drinks are not much more than a pint - we tested refilling one from a water glass. It's mostly just thick plastic. Once we were done eating, it took forever to get the check and another forever for them to process the payment. Luckily we were with good company, but I'd definitely not come back by choice."}
{"text":"Our experience at Carlos' N Charlie's was great! Good food, good drinks and excellent service. Every server that walked by asked is if they could help us, not just our own server. The highlight of the early evening was the best close-up magician I have EVER seen; William Mandell, incredible!!! Special shout out to our excellent server, Carlos! Thank you for a wonderful experience from a Las Vegas local desperately needing a weekend off."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with 15 other people. I ordered the fajita salad and half way through I found a metal bracket in my salad. I have never experienced this before in my life. As I pulled the metal piece out of my salad and held it up my friends were just as amazed as I was. The manager Pattied immediatly came ouver and apologized. She comped my meal and a few drinks. Now thta I think about it hey should have given us a huge discount for that mishap. We I wont be going back there anytime soon. Was my firs and last time."}
{"text":"NEVER EVER EVER EVER!  Me and a few of my other co workers (we're all bartenders and cocktail servers in downtown) went out after work...so we all had a few hundred on us Thursday Nov 20 one of the girls needed food so a guy stopped us offered us a band and for $20.00 get unlimited well drinks into \"the club\" and for $40 or $50 get top shelf unlimited...we asked at 1 are u still serving guy said sure are..so we all purchased then he told us ohh no we're not serving food then they demand I finish my drink before I enter then haha to top it off they told us the unlimited ends in less than two hours....so he refunded all our money but it was heinous lies to try and pull U in..."}
{"text":"SCAM, SCAM, SCAM.  Our group of 5 girls paid for \"premium\" open bar and once at the bar, this did not include \"premium\" liquor.  The bartender was rude and deliberately avoid serving one of us all night!!  Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"The bar staff and Buritto Charlie are the Best"}
{"text":"Food great.  Service sub par. Waitress looked at like we should know all the happy hour specials.  17.50 for a beer.  Same beer at home 6.50.  Yeah, I get it, Vegas.  85.00+ late lunch for two. It will never happen again..."}
{"text":"I've never written a Yelp review. Unfortunately, I didn't use Yelp before some friends and I stopped in at this place.  I echo everyone's sentiments that this is one of the worst dining choices you could ever make. This place is so horrible it needs to be called out.  I dined there on 11/12/2012. I was with a some people and we just wanted to take a break from gambling and get a bite to eat and some drinks before heading to another casino. Huge mistake.  While we were seated right away and the waitress took our drink orders, we didn't see our drinks (or our waitress) for a good twenty minutes. Eventually, some guy showed up (who was not our server) to take our dinner orders.   I should also mention the atmosphere. If you're planning to eat in the dining section, don't plan on talking to anyone around you. The music is blaring and you'll have to shout at each other. I've also never seen a group of wait staff pretending to have so much fun. I almost felt sad for them. And the kicker was when they started offer free tequila shots at the bar with a bartender pretending to be Tom Cruise in Cocktail. I've never seen a bar/restaurant try so hard and so epically fail.  As for the food, save your money (and most importantly your time) and go to Taco Bell. It's actually much, much better. And I eat at Taco Bell maybe once a year. I got the carne asada tacos which were the blandest thing ever. I heaped every condiment I could find on them and they were still awful. I thought about ordering the special guacamole appetizer which is made at your table but decided against it. Thank god.  After you've eaten, prepare to spend another 30-45 minutes waiting for the check. We actually had to get up to find our waitress and request it. She smiled, laughed, flipped her hair, and said \"Sure, I'll be right back.\" She did show up and take the credit card but apparently duty called elsewhere. She had to prepare the \"special guacamole appetizer\" for another table. Apparently the \"special recipe\" is something they share with their wait staff and make them do it. Another fifteen minutes go by and we're starting to wonder what she did with the credit card. We had to flag down another wait person to ask if our waitress was coming back.  Eventually, she showed up. She was all happy and perky. And oblivious. Much like this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch since we're staying in the hotel, and wish I would've just gone across to Chayo (at the Linq).  The chips and salsa were good, the drinks are watered down, the food does not taste fresh (it tastes like re-heated food), and customer service is okay.  The patio is nice, and the music is appreciated but that's about it.  It terms of pricing, I guess it's fine considering it's Vegas.    Bottom line, if you don't care about the food/drinks/customer service, then this is your place.  I'm not coming back!"}
{"text":"As bad as most everyone says it is. Why can't they fix this? Fast food would be a better option. It's a shame because they are so well known."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place for dinner since I was staying in the hotel was tired and didn't feel like venturing out. I had the chimichanga figuring that was a pretty safe bet but it wasn't very good it was actually pretty gross. The Vegas sunset drink wasn't very good either. And Love Mexican food. This is probably more tex mex and still falls a little short  The frozen two for one margaritas are pretty good if you get the right bartender. Other than maybe a Margarita outside at the bar I probably won't return to this place"}
{"text":"Food was Just ok, place was packed and service slow.  Expensive for what you get.  It was a great patio and the staff was very friendly.  There are just so many better options in Las Vegas.  Lunch for three was 100 bucks, ok, half of that was booze."}
{"text":"If you were a fan of the Carlos' n Charlie's on Sunset, fuggedabout this joint, it sucks! While the waiter was charming and handsome as all get out, not even his beautiful smile could make up for the fact that those in the kitchen could not cook worth a damn! There is no  one in that kitchen worthy of being called a chef! They did not even put all of the ingredients in the dish! I guess I was not supposed to notice there was no Chorizo in my Quesadilla, Really? Not everyone that visits Vegas is from Podunk! The margarita was good. The end!"}
{"text":"3 stars based only on the food because the service here really leaves something to be desired.  I ate here twice during the week I was in Vegas because we had two Groupons to use among our group.  Food was quite tasty but they have very little on the menu that is vegetarian friendly.  How a Mexican restaurant doesn't have veggie fajitas or bean burritos or the like is beyond me.  They did have a great ensalada with apples, goat cheese, and walnuts but that doesn't scream Mexican to me.  In any case, it was good enough to eat twice.  The appetizer nachos were decent as was the tableside guac.  Both times we ate here everyone liked what they ordered.  They have 2 for 1 margaritas during happy hour as well as half price Smirmoff martinis for Thursday ladies night.  The ambiance is fun and the servers are upbeat and friendly when you can find them.  Expect a long wait for drinks, food, refills, the bill....  Prices are a little high but you can expect that seeing as it's Vegas.  You do save a little if you are a Total Rewards member.  Worth eating at if you are staying at the Flamingo and don't mind slow service."}
{"text":"Great service,fun and entertaining!!!!  Dave was a great server as well as entertainer to all the guest . He mentioned specials and accommodated everyone.  Their voices(Lance and Dave) aren't the best especially when they don't know the words to those 80s songs lol  but they keep a smile on your face.  I love a place where u feel welcomed and like your visiting friends, whether your a local or a visitor.  Come down to the flamingo hotel and come try out Carlos n Charlies.  Sit on the patio, enjoy the entertainment while being misted to keep you cool.   Thumbs up all around thanks guys.  Till next time...."}
{"text":"This place is a JOKE! Food was bland! Has the black bean soup. The chicken chunks was gross. The street tacos with carne asada the meat has to seasoning at all! My food was cold ans so was my.husbands, you ask the waitress for do ur cream and 20 min later here she comes, we also asked for salt as it wasn't on our table, never brought it!"}
{"text":"Patio is great. Service was slow but it was Jimmy Buffett weekend. Not sure that made a difference. Shrimp tacos were to die for. A little pricey but I don't spend a lot of time in Vegas and don't  know how it stacks up to other places. Highly recommend the tacos though.. Hopefully next time service will be better."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant that we went to on the strip. Easy access since it was in our hotel. Best margaritas I have ever had and amazing food. The staff was wonderful and the service was quick! We were happy to see they had a gluten free menu for me."}
{"text":"Had one of the worse experiences a restaurant ever. My hubby & i went after a long day of being on the road and checking in at the hotel...we decided to come here, without Yelping first. First, mistake. The service was very poor for the restaurant being practically empty when we were there. We finally ordered, got nachos since we thought it was the safest item on the menu.  they were decent. A quarter way into eating them, we spot a cockroach on the wall of our table. We freaked and wanted to leave asap. We told our waitress, who proceed to inform her manager. The manager came over to speak to us and apologized, she comp our meal but at that point we just wanted to leave. which did the minute we gathered our things.  We should have Yelp first.  Sad part was we were still hungry. Later in the night, this location plays loud music you can hear up to 21st floor at the Flamingo hotel. Not cool if you are trying to go to sleep, the hotel can't do anything about it since it's an indepedent business fromt he hotel. Ugh, just added more fuel to the fire to dislike this place. Although, they handle the situation according, it didn't make it any better."}
{"text":"Wanted to eat at the Buffet but it was closed and we didn't want to wait 2 hours for dinner to start. So someone suggest Carlos' n Charlie's; we should have waited for the Buffet..... Our waiter was nice and fairly prompt, food took a little while to get and was way over priced for what you get and the quality. After looking at the menu a couple members of our party ordered some appetizers to hold them until the buffet opened and drinks, A small bag of Chips and Canned Salsa $7.00, come on it's a bar, you want people to drink give them some free chips and Salsa (Bartending 101) but no this place gouges you for $7.00 for chips. A small Cheese Quesadilla $14.00, again only double the price of any other Mexican restaurant. Since it was happy hour some drinks were 2 for one, this would be nice if they were good but they were not that great.... 1 Star for the Food, and High Prices and extra star for our waiter, won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I love Guacamole made tableside, & a beautiful May afternoon on Carlos'n Charlie's lively patio whetted my appetite.    Margaritas were weak, not special at all.    The menu showed high prices for Mexican food.   Much as I hate to play the chain card, I just was not impressed."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what constitutes Mexican food these days but hey they attempt something resembling it here.  Our party was seated in the outdoor patio section next the bar so I tried the margarita and the specialty shooters for the day.  A special concoction for the countdown to the NFL season party, place was busy.  Also there was this raffle for an all expense trip to Cancun, and yeah someone in our party won it, along with more free shots.  Overall the food is not very good and neither are the drinks but those were mostly free so it made up for it in the end."}
{"text":"Food wasn't so good little meat on a flour taco , but the frozen margarita 2 for one hit me good different taste but good i love beans & the beans aren't so good & waiter was nice but food & service took to long & it wasn't even pack"}
{"text":"This was a new place to try and the food was good, the atmosphere was nice, a little loud music. The food was your traditional Mexican-american food. This was was not busy at all for a Friday night which you would think being inside the Flamingo, it would be popping. I think they need to try and find a way to revamp there restaurant or it will be like alot of the other places that close up."}
{"text":"Ewwwww!!! When I see an advertisement for guacamole and margaritas that's a given walk-in for me and what a letdown! I went there for a drink and had the house margarita on the rocks which was fine, typical house margarita. We had ordered the table side guacamole and it was disgusting!!!! Avocadoes were basically frozen so they were barely mashed and every bite you felt like you were eating icy avocadoes. The chips that came along with the guacamole were OK but the guac was such a turnoff we barely ate. We didn't stay long due to lack of an experience. A couple sits down next to us and orders the 2 for 1 margaritas. As we get our bill we see we paid full price so when we inquired with the 1 bartender for the whole entire restaurant he states the deal is only for frozen margaritas. Hello??? Wouldn't a bartender mention specials to their patrons? If we were aware we defiantly would have had the frozen margaritas. I honestly don't know how this place stays alive. D√©cor was gross and the bar was lacking any type of friendly positive vibes. This is a defiantly a do not go to place in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely horrible and cold. The only thing I ate that was decent was my cup of tortilla soup but even then it was more tortilla strips than soup. I ordered the Charlie's chimichanga and I swear to you they used a frozen chimichanga and flash fried it. It was luke warm inside with grisly bits of meat. Disgusting! I couldn't even eat it. For $15 you would expect decent quality. I live in la and can get the same meal fresh for no more than $10. Hell I make my own baked version that tastes better than this crap. The beans were tasteless and less than a spoonful on the plate. The rice looked and tasted like it came from box. I've eaten at some not so authentic Mexican restaunts and none can compare to this bastardization of what they call Mexican food. Do not go here. They're regular margaritas was horrible as well. We threw our drinks away and neither of us finished our meal. Also, what Mexican restaurant charges for chips and salsa?   Stay away, far, far away."}
{"text":"I don't think I've had such a awful experience at any restaurant  in my life. Mind you this happened on my birthday. I go to order some wings to go and while I wait I decide to grab a drink. Well at the end of my drink I notice in the corner of my eye something brown in my drink and to my surprise I find a dead roach in my drink. It was the most disgusting feeling I've ever felt. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. I'm to the point I don't even wanna eat at any restaurant  again. Such a awful experience be aware of this place"}
{"text":"Not surprised to see it  have just average reviews It is at the end of the day just very average. Nice atmosphere. Poor service. Pretty good food. Stupidly expensive for what you get. Nice patio. Some good things here and some bad things here but at the end of the day, I do not think I would be back.that is exactly what I thought after the first time I ate here too.   Not sure exactly what to say other than it just misses"}
{"text":"They are located inside the Flamingo Hotel and we were staying there so they were convenient. The food was OK. Like everything on the strip, it is overpriced. Look on Yelp and you can find plenty of places slightly off the strip that offer a better overall value."}
{"text":"1 star is for the food. Waited at the host stand for at least 10 minutes before being spoken to, the host then told us that seating outside was unavailable and didn't know how long it would take for a table to open up. So he seats us in the dining room at a somewhat dirty table. Maybe 2 minutes later he is taking a party of two outside...no seating outside my ass. Anyways, our server, Victoria, took at least 10-15 minutes to get to us and was completely rude. We had ordered chips and salsa as an app and when it had not arrived after 20 minutes of waiting we asked if she forgot and she said no it takes time. She definitely forgot to ring it in and then came out immediately with it. The frozen margaritas were gross and tastes like there was no tequila in it. Finally our food comes out and we have no silverware but our server is no where to be found. After waiting 3-4 minutes to ask her for silverware. We asked her repeatedly for waters and didn't get them until the end of the meal. When she brought the check the check said she ran our food in at 12:03 when we ordered around 11:30.  She also ignored us majority of the time and talked to us like we were stupid. I will never ever return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Really your a Mexican restaurant with no mint for drinks and the $7 dollar chips and salsa with the salsa that taste like jar pace..... Why are you not making your own salsa??? Let's hope the rest of our meal is better"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Horrible. Ask to be seated outside IF there were misters. We were seated outside but NO Misters.  Moved indoors and proceeded to wait 10 minutes for even water. Never got it from anyone! Overheard our waitress arguing with the next table over what was order vs. what was received. I could not believe it! Seriously?? Unbelievably poor customer service. The same waitress told us \"I'll be with you in a moment\". She never helped us. We got up and left. On the way out, our waitress asked \"So you're leaving?\". YES! AND WON'T BE BACK! Strange location inside of The Flamingo Casino. Looks like the building was just dropped in the middle of the casino."}
{"text":"My visit to Carlos' n Charlie's was a pop-in so I'm not sure if a review is really stating the establishment's true colors.  I sat at the bar at 11:30AM and there were only a small handful of people lunch dining.      I ordered chips and salsa along with fish tacos.  The chip came in a To Go bag and it was a plentiful lot of chips... warm.  The salsa was mediocre but a large portion.  I liked the idea of a bag of chips as people visiting Vegas always need some snacks for later, in their room.      The fish tacos came out quickly to be expected given the small number of people there.  There were three and each was loaded with a healthy amount of what I would call chipotle coleslaw and breaded fish.  I think I wanted more fish but as I ate my way through the first two tacos I realized I was eating some pretty good food.  The tacos came with three small bowls each having a sauce (hot oily sauce, ranch and tartar sauce).  I dipped into all three throughout my meal and liked the oily hot sauce best).  My drink order was club soda with lime - no way that gets screwed up.      So what can I say but give an A-OK rating.  The food was served hot, tasty, quick and I had the place all to myself.  My bar keeper was a lovely tattoo'd specimen with a friendly smile - charming gal really.  Life was good for 45 minutes at least for me during my visit to Carlos' n Charlie's in FLAMINGO Vegas."}
{"text":"Disgusting! I hardly ever write reviews but this place was HORRIBLE! We start off with drink a margarita that tasted like soap and was loaded with sugar, my boyfriend had a warm Modelo. Slightly turned off we opted to only order appetizers hoping the food would be better.. boy were we wrong .. the $6 chips and salsa were gross the salsa tasted like tomato paste and the chips were stale. We also had the Charlie's quesadilla, which is suppose to have 3 meats in it but was instead overfilled with cheese and was ice cold.... do not eat here!!!! Save yourself"}
{"text":"We ate here twice. The food was fine, chain restaurant on the strip food. Wasn't amazing or unique but it tasted fine. They have decent drink specials and average drinks. The staff there is what makes the place great. The waitresses were really fun and friendly, kept bringing us stuff even though we were sitting in the self service section. The bar managers Coco and Ian are really amazing. They were funny and nice and really talkative during the day. We went to a \"party\" there on our last night. The party was crap, they \"promoters\" who got us to go mislead us and the promotion staff there was beyond rude. A man from the promotions company yelled and cussed in my face, so close he was repeatedly spitting on me. He wouldn't tell me his name or who he worked for. The hotel did nothing. Ian and Coco stepped in and took really good care of us after that incident. I won't stay at the Flamingo again but I may stop by that restaurant again if I'm ever in Vegas just to see if they are still tending the bar."}
