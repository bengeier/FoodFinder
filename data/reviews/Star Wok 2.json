{"text":"This place is terrible!! I got SO sick from his place. So did my son and my husband. I will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"The owners are such nice people.  Their food is delicious.  My boyfriend and I are quite the regulars there.  Sandy the owner is always so hospitable.  When we order for delivery they are always on time.  Whenever my family craves Chinese Food, Star Wok 2 is where we go!!!!  Thank you Sandy!  We finally got a great Chinese restaurant that's in our side of town."}
{"text":"The Kung Po beef has a perfect amount of spice, and the pan fried noodles are incredible. The staff are always friendly , you get so much food you always have to take some home .  I love this place"}
{"text":"This place has great Chinese food, authentic sizzling rice soup and mushu wraps! Pickup was very quick as well."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have found in Peoria. I've had delivery and pickup and was great both times. Nice portions and the quality is so much better than anything nearby. Definitely give this spot a try!!!"}
{"text":"What the hell! This location is closed down due to health department. I drove all the way over to try this place due to the favorable reviews...I have the worse luck, ugh!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from here today, my first time trying this place. I was pleasantly surprised. It was fast, not over $20, super delicious and very filling. I will definitely be recommending this to the family for dinner sometime soon."}
{"text":"Great delivery but the food was not good...very bland.  Too bad because I really wanted a good chinese delivery since my favorite one left.  Not this one."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for first time and it was  Delicious they actually quoted 40 minutes for delivery and they were here and less than 30 the order was exactly what we had ordered and the Eagles were amazing I judge a lot on how the egg rolls are and they were delicious  definitely will be going back and the price is right"}
{"text":"So here is how I feel about this place it is not the worse nor the best I have had. I wish I could find a good Chinese food restaurant but this was just ok. The chow mien was just ok, not very flavorful and the fried rice could have used a little more of just something to make it taste better. They had coke products which of course was awesome for me. The orange chicken was good, it didn't have the floral taste to it which was good. I have had other places and they are always so sweet, this one was good. The restroom needed some attention but overall this place was ok. Don't think I would come back because I am looking for that one place that is just awesome. The search continues, but if u are in the mood for just ok Chinese food then this place is good for you. Again it's not bad but it just needed something else to make it better."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we really enjoyed it!  We started with the hot & sour soup, egg flower soup, and crab wonton's.  Then we had the House Wok Three and the General Tso's Chicken, all the food was made fresh and well proportioned!  The staff was very friendly, we will diffinately be back for more!"}
{"text":"Eat here at least once a week. Best Chinese food EVER! They are very accommodating with my family and I, as we are very picky with what we eat. They don't mind & are extremely nice! Very affordable & delicious."}
{"text":"Mongolian Beef, My next order. Friendly Customer Service. Looking forward to my Birthday Lunch. :) Delicious Taste."}
{"text":"Finally I found some really good Chinese food. Spring rolls are delicious, the BBQ pork was the most tender ever, and Hunan beef was full of meat, and broccoli was super-flavorful. I ordered online and chose mildly spicy, and it was perfect Just wish it was closer to me.  Hey, maybe Star Wok 3?"}
{"text":"Greatest plus side is that they deliver!!! I ordered online after looking through the menu a bit. Everything was fairly priced, and there were a lot of items to choose from.  For the price, everything is in good sized portions. I was able to check the status of my delivery and they came right on time! The food was fresh, and delicious! I will definitely be choosing them again."}
{"text":"I am house sitting for my sister and I chose to search yelp for places that deliver. Star wok came up and i saw the good reviews. After checking the prices which were extremely affordable I decided to place an order. I got an order of crab puffs, orange chicken with noodles, fries, and a side of chili paste (if you like spicy then you MUST get this)... all of that food before tax and delivery fee was just $12!! With delivery fee it came out to around $14.. honestly you can't beat that. They estimated my delivery time to be around 45-60 min. My food got there in about 30!! The best part is that the food was really tasty! The orange chicken had a ton of flavor.. everything was hot. I will definitely order from this restaurant again and already told my family about it!"}
{"text":"my first experience with Star Walk was pretty good. I enjoyed it. I ordered one of the same dishes this time and it was horrible. Was supposed to be rib tips and what I got was a mixture of dry tips and some microwaved BBQ pork. had to be one of the worst dishes ever but, it was followed by a really bad dish their egg foo young. I don't know what they did to the eggs but they're like bricks. their food quality is inconsistent at best. I believe this is my 4th time and every time worse than the last. I think this will be my last time"}
{"text":"Been using delivery many many times, always good always, on time !!!  The only Asian food I have delivered !! There the best."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Chinese food I've ever had. My husband and I got the general tsos chicken and it had the perfect amount of spice and best flavor ever! Customer service was excellent. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow This hidden gem is incredible.   Authentic flavorful fresh  You need to try this restaurant and it will become a favorite.   Eat in or take out. They even deliver. You will save their telephone number in your phone."}
{"text":"Ordered from here through Yelp for pickup. Eat24 called as I was pulling into the parking lot saying they couldn't get a hold of them to place the order. There was a \"this location has closed\" sign taped to the door and all of the blinds were pulled. Seems like they went out of business and didn't tell Eat24."}
{"text":"I was not thrilled with the food. Very bland and definitely not delicious. We LOVED the appetizers but not the meals. That is why I gave it a 2 star not zero.   Below is the breakdown of what we ordered.   Fried Shrimp- Loved very good and crunchy tasted FRESH Crab puff- Yummy and tasty LOVED Wor wonton & Hot/Sour soup- Bland and no flavor the hot sour had no meat.  Orange spare ribs- Extremely saucy and fatty under cooked.  Happy house- The shrimp and beef were tender and good, the rest tasted stale and bland. I did  not like the crab meat texture was slimy and artificial.   I went off of the prior reviews and was expecting amazing food. But was definitely disappointed in our Friday date night in meal."}
{"text":"Great food! We have done delivery and pick up and it's always on time or even early! Portions are a good size and everything is perfectly priced!"}
{"text":"Prices are low, delivery is fast, food is awesome - doesn't get much better than that! Everything we've tried from Star Wok 2 has been great, and also seemed to be a cut above your typical Chinese restaurant. Nothing was soggy or excessively greasy and everything was really fresh. I'm thinking you probably can't go wrong with anything on the menu but I've tried and liked their egg rolls, wonton soup, egg flower soup, chicken fried rice, cashew shrimp, and teriyaki chicken."}
{"text":"The food was delivered super fast and the menu had plenty of options at great prices. I ordered the orange chicken with fried rice. The orange chicken was reminded me of boneless wings, and the sauce tasted similar to the honey hot wings from Barros. The rice was also really dry and bland. However the crab wontons were amazing!"}
{"text":"AWESOME food.    Great service.   Just wish they had more business.  May be due to location.    They need a stand alone building.  The portions are more than adequate and the price is reasonable.   The food is fresh.   Best egg rolls I've ever had."}
{"text":"Delicious every time! Probably the only place I like to order from. Their walnut shrimp is to die for. We are a monthly customer."}
