{"text":"Every little thing helps hungry people and the homeless. The helping café deals greatly about those issues. The food there it is terrific and the Starbucks coffee is matched only in a Starbucks store. Personal service by the employees and the helpings café is much better than most other food service cafés.I highly recommend this little café to be a regular patron again and again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food and even more, the mission of this place. Great lunch stop and can't wait to order catering from there for work. Spread the word, spread the love!"}
{"text":"This is a terrific little breakfast and sandwich shop you got to go there. It's also for a great cause for homelessness did these wonderful people work. Stop by it's a very friendly atmosphere very homey atmosphere an excellent food for the price."}
{"text":"Helpings is the ultimate meeting location - great space, energy, food, beverages & cause. Perfect for a student working on homework, friends catching up over coffee or community leaders collaborating at the large beautifully reclaimed table. Choosing to purchase your Starbucks or freshly made artisan sandwich here also casts a vote for the kind of place you want Phoenix to be - a city where we care for our vulnerable, offer them job training, opportunities to build a resume and truly end the cycle of homelessness.  I especially love the grilled chicken salad and the pesto chicken sandwich, and of course the funky monkey muffin as well!"}
{"text":"Great social venture concept. The staff is well trained and the meals are simple but good."}
{"text":"Was eating lunch with open mind not really gluten free eater.  The food was cold when they brought it to us.  The biscuit was hard with cold gravy.  This was before health department gave them a low rating.  Disappointed"}
{"text":"Supper Friendly staff!!! I had the club sandwich and it was excellent. It was also huge so I took half home for a second meal."}
{"text":"I had no idea this was here. and the word needs to get out to everyone to come! This is a great cause. Great food that helps the homeless, yes please! I had a grilled cheese and fries and iced black tea and it was all great and reasonable. We had a large party of 12 and service was fast and really friendly. Everyone's food looked great and they got us served in no time. I will be stopping here soon to try some muffins for breakfast as well. They look yummy. Not often you find something that both helps others and gives you a great lunch, a great 2 for!"}
{"text":"Just had a box lunch at an event and it was amazing. Great work helpings cafe!!!   One thing I'll point out is I had to search for your contact info as the box has no address nor phone number and I would like to use you for my future events.  Might think about adding contact info to top of box or maybe on a tab I could pull off..    GREAT FOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"I was at a dental conference at the airport Marriott and I turned to my fellow Yelpers for a place for lunch. I saw the 5 star rating and didn't hesitate! Something in the back of.my head told me I had heard of this place! I got there and remembered where! They serve Starbucks and the proceeds help the homeless! A GREAT sandwich and a good cause! I am all in!! I ordered a veggie sandwich, excellent and if there are any muffins left when I am done devouring it ......"}
{"text":"Delicious food, hefty portions, friendly staff, Starbucks coffee, and giving back. I would definitely recommend helping yourself to a Helpings lunch!   My lunch was so fresh and yummy plus I had to take half of it home. My food and coffee were prepared by workers in the food prep and barista program who are gaining employment skills. It's a nonprofit so all proceeds go to the homeless shelter connected to the restaurant.   All around great experience for me and my tummy!"}
{"text":"Helpings Cafe has great service, great prices, and it supports a great cause. Its interior is a cross of 50's cafe with modern touches."}
{"text":"It is food with a purpose of helping people and doing good.  I really like that concept and I like their chicken salad sandwich.  Everyone was very nice, friendly, and helpful as I sometime get disorientated in places like this if its not fully out in front of me. The walked my through the menu and my options until I had exactly what I needed.  Stop in, eat lunch, and help a cause all at the same time!"}
{"text":"Was running late and couldn't find a starbucks close to my job. Found this little piece of awesomeness and was able to start my day lol :) it looks like they give to a lot of great charities. I'll definitely be back if anything for their interaction with the community"}
{"text":"Wonderful foods with a very appetizing presentation and great coffee also . This is a training program at UMOM for homeless people to learn skills. It is large and sparkling clean. The people are very friendly, professional, and eager to please! A great contribution to help end homelessness."}
{"text":"Good food with a great mission!  It's great to see exactly how your dollars are going to support homeless people!  It's also a \"we proudly serve\" Starbucks location with a full drink menu. And they have free wifi, with plenty of space, so great for a meeting!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and I love that my money is going towards a good cause.  Stop by there instead of spending money at a chain restaurant!"}
{"text":"It's a great place to sit and chat. Food is fresh and yummy. Not to mention it's for a good cause!"}
{"text":"Paid $8 for a veggie sandwich which I thought was a bit much.  It was not fresh tasting and all my toppings were falling off.  My husband got a grilled chicken sandwich and they put so much mayo and the grilled chicken looked like it was microwaved over all was not very good. Friendly employees though."}
{"text":"I would rather eat here than anything out there for lunch. I have never had a bad meal and it's giving back to the community. Being on the run all day it's hard to find a solid place and this is a good place to eat and take a break from the world."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Their avocado toast, breakfast burritos, & salads are sooo good. The staff and manager are welcoming and so friendly. I love getting my Starbucks here knowing my coffee addiction is at least going to a great cause ; )"}
{"text":"I love this place. The muffin I had was great and the barista was friendly. The community feel is awesome- it seemed like everyone knew everyone else."}
{"text":"Each time I come to Helpings, I am impressed with not only the staff's kindness but the many many lunch options! I have had some seriously tasty sandwiches and the desserts are divine! You can get any preparation of coffee you could dream of, and even fresh fruit smoothies. It is a special place that makes delicious food, cuts no corners, AND is charitable to a fault. They even have some perks for returning customers :)"}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast and lunch in the downtown PHX area for sure!!!! Besides the great service from the awesome crew here led by the one and only Gina; here's why I love this place:   1. They give back! This social enterprise was designed to give back to the UMOM Community and feed it's lifesaving programs...which is one reason I love spending money here!   2. Phenomenal Muffins! (and they don't charge you $7 for one ((Cough Cough Sprinkles)) Plus they don't leave you feeling guilty, they are actually on the healthy'er side...if that makes sense.  3. They have stellar Daily Specials for $4.99! Comes with an entree, side, & a drink. You cannot beat this deal. Plus the awesome chef Reyna in the back makes some delicious specials always switching it up keeping it interesting.   4. They have a partnership with Starbucks where they work with non-profits! So they teach individuals job skills to develop and find a job!   5.I'm The Duke baby! Proof I love this place so I put my stamp on it.   So come on in, don't be afraid to drop some cash for a good cause (buy a meal, grab some Starbucks Coffee, and take a muffin for the ride home) and enjoy your meal!   Lastly here's what you can find here:   -Sandwiches (Vegetarian options as well) -Salads -Starbucks Coffee -House Made Muffins  -House Made Seasoned Potato Chips -Green Tea -Daily Specials  -Catering  -Snacks -Pretzels & Hummus  -Subs to go -Energy Bars"}
{"text":"I never post reviews on Yelp, but this place was fantastic. The hospitality was fantastic. The food was really fresh. Just fantastic! Happy out of Townes right here!"}
{"text":"Just tried their muffins. Maybe the best muffin I ever ate in my life! I tried the one with the sunflower seeds on the top. As awesome as a muffin can be awesome!  Yes! Yes! Yes!"}
{"text":"Ambience: Medium sized urban cafe with a positive vibe. About 15 tables plus long bar. Appears newly decorated with a comfortable-retro feel to it.   Patrons: Everyone from business lunch crowd to locals.  Food: Excellent daily lunch specials, which often include freshly made sandwiches, pastas, soups and veggie options. I really liked the roasted turkey sandwich. Also great selection of baked goods. They serve Starbucks as well."}
{"text":"First off, I love the mission of this place. It's hard not to be a fan of any restaurant that helps the homeless (like Philadelphia's Rooster Soup Company) or someone who needs a break. I stopped in on my way to a conference downtown. It's a comfortable, welcoming environment, filled with welcoming people (they were pulling muffins out of the oven when I arrived). I ordered the breakfast sandwich, which had egg, bacon and cheese. It was a good sandwich, though if I'm being honest it could have used just a little more salt and maybe some sort of aioli or something to give it that extra flavor punch (and moisture). In any case, the price was very fair. I'd certainly come back and try their pastries or order a drink, and I'm happy that my money is doing some good for someone else."}
{"text":"It's a rare thing nowadays when you find a place with as a heart as Helpings Cafe has. They serve awesome food, baked goods and drinks as well as catering and they have a small market inside as well. Located on Van Buren and 33rd street right next to UMOM, they provide funds to help house and train the homeless and underprivileged and well as school supplies to children that what otherwise wouldn't be able to afford to have. I love the concept, as a man who one day wants to own his own restaurant that would by day be a restaurant and by night be a soup kitchen I really appreciate this wonderful place. Today I enjoyed a wonderfully delicious Morning Glory muffin and a latte. The muffin was so moist it left no dry spot in my mouth and filled my mouth with so many flavors that I just wanted to keep eating more. Filled with veggies and fruit it's a muffin I didn't have to feel too bad about eating either. It was in no way heavy like most muffins, and was truly a \"morning glory\" to my taste buds.  Price wise they are very affordable, especially compared to most bakeries, local restaurants and coffee shops around the valley.  I will definitely be back soon to enjoy more food, drinks, and baked goods; as well as to share more cooking stories and see if I can help in any way. Do yourself a favor and stop on in and grab a bite and a drink, while supporting a great cause."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, very reasonable prices and helping a cause. One of my best finds!!!"}
{"text":"I had went to a meeting the week prior and was very impressed by the luncheon that had been catered. I inquired as to who supplied the food and was told this place. Upon returning to my office I looked it up and was delighted to learn about the organization and the assistance and hope they give to homeless people in the valley.  I decided I had to try the actual brick-and-mortar restaurant so I talked a friend into going with me. I wanted to verify that the food in their restaurant was just as good as their catering had been. I am delighted to report that it was. For lunch the prior week I had tried their Turkey sandwich as well as the Vegetarian and a wonderful salad made with beets, goat cheese, garbanzo beans, and sunflower seeds. It was served with a vinaigrette that was spot on. The bread on the sandwiches was so soft and moist. This time around I wanted to try something different so I ordered the Chicken salad sandwich with homemade chips. The Chicken salad was heavenly and sweet with lots lots of red grapes. I would have preferred a little crunchy element such as celery or pinenuts in it. The homemade chips were so flavorful and cooked to a perfect crisp. I will definitely add this to my list of lunchtime places as well as recommend it to anybody who has a need for catering."}
{"text":"Helpings has amazing coffee and food but what is truly impressive is that this cafe changes lives. The baristas gain work experience with every order and will take those skills with them as they gain employment, independence and permanent housing! Stop by, order some of the worlds best muffins and help end family homelessness!!!!"}
{"text":"The service is great. The food is excellent. The cause is the most important reason to stop in. The grilled chicken sandwich was excellent. They have Starbucks coffee too. Can't wait to try the catering at work."}
{"text":"Why not help the homeless simply by eating lunch or having a coffee!  The food is amazing. I had a caprese sandwich and I added bacon and chicken. Why not?! The sandwich was amazing. The balsamic reduction was just the right amount of sweetness and tart. The pesto sauce was really good and the mozzarella was great.  I didn't expect much walking when I pulled in the but the atmosphere was extremely warm and welcoming. They serve Starbucks coffee and have their own pastries and they are better than Starbucks.  Check it out and help the homeless while you enjoy a great sandwich!"}
{"text":"The company I work for just moved to the neighborhood, and we are super excited about this place!  The food is fresh, the people are kind and friendly and your purchase helps people in need!  They serve Starbucks coffee and some amazing fresh made muffins.  My friend and I couldn't choose just one, so we each got a different muffin and then we split them.  Best...idea...ever.  The espresso mocha chip was chocolaty and rich, so a half was perfect.  The dutch apple crumble was delicious!  I could eat one a day for the rest of my life.  I can't wait to go back. :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing - the food they prepare is delicious! They have a daily special for $5.99 - it is never the same special and I have had everything from sliders, sweet & sour chicken, gyro sandwich w/home made chips AND includes a drink. The turkey sandwich on the menu is the best thing ever. I have never ordered something from here that I did not like!  They are right down the street from where I work & I often call in an order to pick up - makes it super fast w/a 30 min lunch.  The philosphy behind the cafe itself is wonderful - they give back to the local community that is in need - women &children/families. Spend your $$ where you can make it count!"}
{"text":"Stayed at a hotel down the street, and I used Yelp to find a place for breakfast.  Got a salad and and a coffee both were excellent.  A definite stop, and supporting a good cause is just a bonus."}
{"text":"Short and sweet. Great food, great service and very reasonable prices. Country club sandwich was very good and the Greek salad was excellent. I will for sure return."}
{"text":"What a phenomenal concept. Not only do they have excellent sandwiches, salads, muffins & a Starbucks,  all proceeds go to the UMOM family homeless shelter.  All the employees are residents training to be baristas & culinary workers & will have marketable job skills when they transition to living independently. Please support this place. Not only will you enjoy the food,  but you'll be making a huge contribution to our community."}
{"text":"I try to stop by in the mornings before my commute and each time I have had a pleasant experience Food and drinks with a cause The staff is super upbeat and are eager to please They serve Starbucks coffee The muffins are delicious  In my last visit, the very nice lady at the counter was helping or training a very young gentleman... The patience and friendliness of her presence was very contagious as I felt happier giving my money to the young man...   It is really nice to see that some people had a clear vision with how to help people... And putting in the time and effort to ensure that their goals are met...  The Helpings Cafe is unique in giving majority of their proceeds to the homeless community and I will support in any way that I can..."}
{"text":"Love this little cafe. Friendly staff and warm welcomes. Jessie and Gina are so sweet."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great cause! The avocado toast (add bacon) and the French toast are both delicious. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food - especially the muffins. They also serve Starbucks coffee along with lunch items like sandwiches and salads.  What is really great about Helpings is that the proceeds support UMOM, a homeless shelter for families. I like that my Starbucks addition can make a difference!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful, food is excellent and always striving to be better quality healthy food. Part of costs goes to good cause and this place has a friendly manager who cares about her staff. They will soon be rolling out an awesome breakfast menu opening at 7am looking forward to that."}
{"text":"SOCIAL ENTERPRISE DONE RIGHT This is a great community space where you can support a nonprofit, eat deliciously tasty food and have plenty of quiet to hold a business meeting or catch up with a friend.  Their location is in the same UMOM building/parking lot. They serve Starbucks coffee and make amazing pastries.  My next business meeting, when convenient, will be held at Helpings."}
{"text":"I sponsored a seminar for 190 attendees and hired Helpings Catering to bring in food for the event.  I'm so glad I did!  From start to finish, it was so easy working with them.  They prepared wonderful sandwiches, a salad and cookies and chips, along with drinks.  The chips were homemade and, while there were some left after the event,  there was not one left by the next morning - they were so good!  The sandwiches were top quality as was the salad.  My attendees were raving about the food.  It's nice to help support UMOM without one bit of sacrifice on quality.  Danielle, thanks for everything - it was a pleasure."}
