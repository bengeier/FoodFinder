{"text":"Toujours aussi bon! Se sont de belles grosses portions. La salade César est très bonne. Les crêpes sont délicieuses. Fondue au chocolat pour faire plaisir à notre fille. C'était une portion pour une personne, mais nous avons mangé 3 dessus. Une belle grosse portion de fruits variées. Personnel très gentil. On retournera c'est sure!"}
{"text":"Spent half of my life living in France and pretty familiar with the \"real\" crêpe bretonne. This is by far the worst quality/ cost ratio restaurant claiming crepe speciality.  The service was \"impersonal\", a little smile would always have been appreciated.  Don't  recommend. AT ALL"}
{"text":"J'adore"}
{"text":"The restaurant was very good. The crepe bretonne was amazing ! The vegetable soup was homemade and Delicious! Would recommend this restaurant for lunch or breakfast. Service was perfect."}
{"text":"Location: In St. Sauveur village. They have a very small parking lot so most people park on the street.   Food: These guys have a wide variety of crepes so it really depends on what you're in the mood for. You can opt for healthy or put a dent in your sweet tooth. Their portions are quite large, and the crepes are made to order so you don't need to worry about being served a flat, dry piece of cardboard.   Service: Hit or miss. I've had good service here, but I've also had lousy service. It depends on the day.  Price: Personally, I find some of their items to be over-priced for what they're serving. On the flip side, they do have affordable priced crepes so it depends on what you order.   This place is popular with the tourists, so call ahead to see if you can make a reservation, if you plan to stop in for brunch on the weekend."}
{"text":"Magnifique! The crepes are bigger than your head - enough for 2-3 to share. The salad and raclette were also delish. Cozy and lovely atmosphere. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"\"After an amazing long weekend at a Tremblant, we had to stop somewhere on the way back and satisfy our French onion soup craving.   Creperie a la Gourmandise Bretonne is a charming place in a quiet town. We were welcomed by a crepe-making station as our waitress lead the way through quite a few rooms.  Our Soupe de l'oignon gratinee was delicious, with just the right amount of cheese melted and cooked to perfection on top! We also shared their huge crepe from \"Nos crepes formage avec..\" section. We picked epinard at jambon. It was delightful, as it came with a thick cheesy sauce on top. Very filling!  We wished we had more time to enjoy this place, as our neighboring table of ladies were taking their time having a fondue. There are a lot of worthwhile dishes on the menu - including raclettes!  This place is definitely worth checking out, especially for those of us cheese-lovers out-there!\"  This is just a bite of our full review.."}
{"text":"It's a good and very often very busy place. They have a parking next to the building. For sure they have a lot of possible combination of crepes so you should be able to find something at your taste and they are served quickly so they are tasty and the portion are generous. The ingredients are fresh but also regular. I didn't liked the chocolate too sweet and like a liquid sirup. They have also cheese, Chinese or chocolate fondues. At Halloween, Easter or Christmas, the building is one of the most decorated in the village. It's delightful for children.  It's a good restaurant to try in St-Sauveur."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I came with my two young kids and they were so patient and helpful. The food was phenomenal. We had the ceasar salad, onion soup and the vegetarian crepe. The house merlot was amazing too. I recommend this place to all!"}
{"text":"Impressive crepes in size! The chocolate a la fondue is really good, in traditional (though, still great) association with banana slices and vanilla ice cream (gigantic). Only remark: I would have preferred a thicker crepe."}
{"text":"Je tiens tout d'abord à mentionner que je ne suis pas la plus grande fan de crêpes. Quoique... après ma visite à la Crêperie à la Gourmandise Bretonne, j'étais une femme changée!  Sérieusement, c'était tellement délicieux que les seules paroles qui se sont partagées lors de ce lunch entre amies étaient des onomatopées exprimant le plaisir, la joie et le régal. Miam.  Le menu est assez intimidant, mais notre serveuse dotée d'un gentillesse incroyable a pu nous aider à faire notre choix. Pour moi, c'était une crêpe au fromage avec béchamel et bacon. Elle était énorme et ne m'a pas déçue. De la gourmandise par excellence, comme le mentionne le nom du restaurant.   Bref, la crêperie est un must si vous passez par St-Sauveur, ou si vous recherchez une belle gâterie d'après-ski."}
{"text":"Everything is very old in this restaurent. I ordered the crêpe jambon champignon fromage, the sauce is very salty and heavy. I do not like their Cappuccino weird  taste. I find is very expensive for the quality of foods and broken chairs. Will not go back again."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for almost 20 years and I have never been disappointed. The salad and onion soup is probably one of the best out there and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Salad Nicoise was great. And the cider refreshing!"}
{"text":"Portion are enormous so come hungry. I ordered the crepe jambon fromage. It was very very salty. My kids enjoyed their crepe with Nutella and Banana. My latte was not good and had a weird machines taste. I will give this place another try another day. The fondue is supposedly a real treat."}
