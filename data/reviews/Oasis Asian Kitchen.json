{"text":"I love this place! Family owned. Best customer service. Great deals for lunch. Must try."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for \"hole in the wall\" Chinese restaurant. Had a Singapore noodles meal and everything was hot and fresh (veggies and all)."}
{"text":"Super good!! It is odd to have an Asian place that has a fresh take on Asian food. The hot and sour soup is amazing so is the chow fun. We're def coming back!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken lo mein is awesome! Sweet family that owns it too! Very friendly and great prices!"}
{"text":"Yum ! We order combo rice & egg drop soup && I loved it . Only thing was the BBQ pork was kinda hard & dry . So next time (because there will be 1) I just won't get the pork . But great place, clean, & wonderful customer service !"}
{"text":"love love love the Singaporean rice noodle curry :)...and the owners are very nice and pleasant..Hope they will get more customers because they deserve it :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and very nice service. I had the cashew chicken as well as the chicken Pad Se Ew. The lady behind the counter (who I believe is the owner) personally comes to check on the people eating in the restaurant and is friendly with a great smile. She genuinely cares if the people enjoy the food. I recommend this restaurant and will be going back to try many more dishes."}
{"text":"Just passing through Vegas on the way East and decided to drop by this little Asian joint. It was fantastic. The service was super friendly (husband and wife I think). They were both very nice and a blast to talk to. If you are on that side of town or passing through, check this place out."}
{"text":"Their shrimp pad Thai was delicious !! Couldn't finish it all because there was so much , over all I would recommend ."}
{"text":"This place use to be great when the older lady was there. I have been there twice since then and have been disappointed. The food doesn't taste as fresh as it use to and once they where out of egg roles. Really bummed and most likely wont be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten at these types of establishments all across the country, for years. This is as good as it gets. Amazing food and incredible service at an unbeatable price. Kudos to you Oasis! You're doing it right!!!"}
{"text":"My goodness, could it get any funner than this?  The darling lady who takes care of you goes beyond great service.  I went there on my last day in Las Vegas because of all the wonderful reviews on Yelp.  The food was hot and delicious.  We ate in and ordered a wide variety of dishes and everything was spot on.  My son had the Pad Thai and I had the Teriaki Beef Bowl, plus we shared the Egg Drop Soup, some Egg Rolls and the Crab thingees - all were wonderful.  It looks like just another strip mall cafe, but this one has exceptional service and delicious food, who could ask for anything more?"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch or take out spot. The food is always piping hot, fresh and consistently good. The prices are very reasonable, especially the lunch menu. The restaurant is very clean and the service is good. It's like eating at your Asian grandma's kitchen."}
{"text":"Excellent service and good, fresh food! Had the Triple Crown, it was ready in less than 10 mins, portion was good. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Was really good, perfect amount of spice added. Was the perfect portion size. The store was clean easy to find very friendly staff I will visit again."}
{"text":"I've read previous reviews about this place and I must say first off customer service WAS Top Notch. Reviewers have mentioned the elderly lady behind the counter and like everybody else she is very sweet, very nice, very welcoming, you just want to give her a big hug! I've been living in this area for years and just now discovered this Hidden Gem. I will definitely now become a regular customer! The prices were very reasonable and the food was amazing. Food cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. The portions were perfect as well.  The restaurant is very small quaint and cozy."}
{"text":"Delicious food The mongolian beef and the red curry was very good. The prices are pretty reasonable too."}
{"text":"Time has not been kind to this restaurant.   About 2 months ago we showed up and they were out of chicken. We stuck with some noodle dishes but were not overly excited.   A few weeks ago there was a notice posted on the door that they were closed due to a failed inspection which was apparently rectified. They have since re-earned their A rating.   A few days later we returned. Since this WAS one of our favorite take-outs, we were happy to give them a few extra chances. They literally had masking tape over the Beef and Salad choices, which is to assume they were out of Beef and Salad, but the young girl behind the counter had trouble communicating, so I just ordered some lunch specials.   The noodle dish I ordered as a lunch special, came with nothing special. No rice, no soup, no egg roll, nada, and it was just awful. Our chicken teriyaki bowl included some stringy chicken with the teriyaki sauce served separately.    The older woman who used to man the counter was always so nice. The young girl we encountered the last few times, not so much.   Sadly we wont be back. We REALLY loved having good take-out in walking distance.   As for my previous post about Gluten free options...there is no way I would trust that anymore. I posted that review when they were still young and going out of their way to accommodate customers."}
{"text":"The closest we've found yet to NY/Long Island Chinese.  They don't have a wide menu, but the food is good and the prices are very reasonable.  I also found the Thai food to be as good as Archies.  The food is consistent.  What else do you want from a restaurant?"}
{"text":"Grandma is a great cook  Wonton Soup is awesome could've used more green veggies but otherwise very good.  Lemon grass Pork is very good tasting as well.  MOST awesome dish is the Red Thai Curry with Beef.  Spicy but not too spicy.  Have to try their Pad Thai for sure on next visit.  Recommend this Chinese food, grandma still knows how to cook traditional way.  PANDA EXPRESS can go bye bye!"}
{"text":"Ordered their Mongolian chicken with rice for take out. It was ready when I arrived, friendly service,, and the dish was delicious! I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Sadly the new owners haven't kept up the quality of this restaurant and I don't feel like it will last. Twice I have headed there to get lunch and it has been shut down for health violations. I really enjoyed this place in the past but now I avoid it as the food isn't as tasty as it was before the change in ownership.   Old Review: Love this local (mostly) Chinese food place for its takeout. Lunch specials are good for dishes like General Tsao's Chicken and Broccoli Beef, and they come with a  choice of egg roll or soup. My favorites though are the noodle dishes like Sa Char Mei Fun and the Singapore Rice Noodles. Classic Thai dishes are available too. Beware they are closed on Mondays but open every other day of the week."}
{"text":"This spot is sooooo good!  We were visiting my friend's parents and they suggested it.  We ordered beef lo mein, general Tso's chicken, two different types of fried rice, and shrimp with lobster sauce.  Everything was really fresh, hot, not greasy, and flavorful.  I wish I had a Chinese restaurant near my own house that was this good!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from here due to an insane craving... Oasis cured my craving!   Over and above though, this was some of the best customer service that I have experienced. The employee that was working the front desk, she was extraordinarily sweet!   I ordered the sweet and sour chicken dish and an egg drop soup. The egg drop soup wasn't as flavorful as I was used to... but that could just be me. Having last had egg drop soup on the East Coast, maybe it's a coastal difference? The sweet and sour chicken was great though and such a huge portion! Since I ordered takeout, they had the sauce on the side, so my chicken wasn't soggy once I got home.   Next time a takeout craving strikes, I know where to take care of it."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is delicious and taste lite and fresh. I also like it so close by.  The owners are so nice and pleasing. Try it you won't regret it haven't had a bad dish yet and I eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"So, this was our first time eating here. We actually ordered delivery. Here are some pros and cons: 1. Delivery was fast, and food was hot. Pro. 2. Egg drop soup was outstanding. Pro. 3. Crab Rangoon wasn't great. Slightly undercooked. And had an off taste. Con. 4. Chicken chow mein was really good. Not much chicken in it though. Pro/con. 5. Fried rice was decent, pretty flavorful. Pro. 6. Mongolian beef was tasty, but the meat was tough. It was also pretty heavy on the onions. Con. 7. General Tso chicken was delicious. The broccoli in that was great. The sauce was really yummy. The chicken itself was all dark meat, which I don't mind, but I know some people prefer white meat. Pro. Overall, we liked it. I'm not sure we would order from there again though... Unless it was just the soup!"}
{"text":"When all the raving five-star reviews are for egg drop soup and orange chicken, scale your expectations accordingly. That being said, there's a distinct freshness here that I really appreciated. Dishes are made to order, your food isn't sitting around in a warmer. Thus there may be a longer wait than the instant-gratification takeout you might be familiar with elsewhere.  All the reviews persuaded me to try the egg drop soup- available in a cup or bowl. Unfortunately I did not find it noteworthy. Needed seasoning. Simple, fresh, but not really rave-worthy.  The basil fried rice with chicken was surprisingly good: low-priced and generous portion ($7), with several chunks of juicy chicken and ample amounts of basil cooked in. Good overall flavor, would love to try a crab version.   Service was friendly. Space is clean and on the modern side. Seems to be more of a takeout place- even dine-in customers appeared to be getting their orders in takeout boxes to eat."}
{"text":"Great customer service!!!! Food was good!!  Prices are good!! Only complaint is that everything is on foam plates/cups and plastic silverware.. Definitely a take out place."}
{"text":"Very friendly. The food is great only thing I wish they served the Tom (coconut soup)"}
{"text":"A great place,very clean,very nice people,food was outstanding and price was perfect all the food I have eaten there(quite a bit)was hot and fresh.If they had delivery it would be fantastic they do not accept Discover credit card."}
{"text":"Great service. Food was good. Price was good. The lady working  at the counter made you feel super welcome."}
{"text":"Wonderfull food. Very fresh and the basil chicken lunch specials was great. Will be back many more times."}
{"text":"Great food excellent service, I order the Shrimp fried rice or the Singapore rice noodles with shrimp always great."}
{"text":"Loved this place, all 4 of us did. Store is clean and everyone is so nice and friendly. This is the best little chinese takeout spot in or around Spring Valley / The Lakes.  Will definitely order again!!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!  We are so happy to finally find great Chinese food here in Vegas which is almost unheard of. This has to be the best kept secret in Vegas!  We took a chance on this place and were pleasantly surprised. The first thing you will notice is the extremely kind older lady who is waiting on you. I would adopt her as my grandmother any day! I assume she and her husband own the place?   The second thing you will notice is that the place is extremely clean and that they advertise and cook all their food without the dangerous ingredient that is banned in most other countries, MSG! Most all Asian restaurants use this dangerous ingredient and it's great to know that someone actually cares about the quality of food they are serving and the health of their patrons.  The third thing you will notice, is that they only have two large tables and three small tables as the majority of their business is take out. However, we elected to dine-in but I'm married. If you're single this may not be the place to take your date as the ambiance is more like you would expect from a take out place than a restaurant. However, if you don't mind simplicity and want great food for great prices this is your place!  We had the Orange chicken and the Pepper Beef. And, let me tell you both were good but the Orange Chicken is the best I have had, even better than the famous Chang's Spicy Chicken at PF Changs. I have never seen such huge chunks of quality white meat with just enough breading. (I would highly recommend getting the Orange chicken with a little spice added to it and you will hit a home run!).  Also, the portions are HUGE. Easily enough to feed one man and one woman. So, an awesome dinner for two for $8 ( two men will need two entrees $16)...where else in Vegas can you pull that off?  The only negative I have is that everything is served in plastic containers. I understand that for take-out, but when I eat in, I would like real dinnerware. However, considering all the other positives, this is a minor negative that we can live with.   We ate here for the first time yesterday and we are on our way back today for more Orange Chicken:)"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a slice above the forgettable mediocrity of 99% of all strip mall chinese joints. Nancy is super sweet, the food is always ready when I get there. No MSG is used either. I recently moved to LV and I'm nervous about trying other chinese food when I know how good the food here is so I'm a loyal customer now. Definitely worth a shot the next time the Chinese food jones hits!"}
{"text":"The food was edible but that's the best I can say.  We ordered pad Thai with veggies (I would have ordered with tofu but it wasn't an option) and the red curry with tofu, both spicy level medium. First of all there was no tofu in the curry, and the veggies were super over cooked.  The pad Thai had no bra sprouts, no spice at all and no limes plus it was super sweet, like dessert sweet.  My order was a delivery order and it was here pretty quickly.  Overall the food quality is like what you might expect in a mall food court, I won't be ordering here again."}
{"text":"This place has great food for a great price. I always get huge portions whenever I order. The owner is the sweetest little lady. I can't help but leave a tip before I leave because she Is the cutest thing lol. This place is right down the street which is super convenient. It used to be another asian restaurant that kinda sucked so I'm glad it's been replaced by people they make great asian food lol. I always get the pad sea ewe and it is packed with flavor and loaded with chicken and veggies. Their salt and pepper chicken wings are delicious. They are fried with bell peppers, onion, garlic, jalapeño, and green onion. I highly suggest that you try it. I've never been disappointed with anything here. Support this local business!!"}
{"text":"The age of the strip mall and the small size of the establishment belies the high quality of both the food and service of Oasis. Sitting on the counter were three bags of take-out waiting for their hungry owners as the middle-aged Asian woman cheerfully took our orders in a heavy but not indecipherable accent.   Our dishes of chicken lo mein and Thai basil string bean chicken came out quickly, piping hot, and full of flavor. The chicken tasted like \"real\" chicken as opposed to the more over-starched chicken all too-common in Chinese fast-food establishments such as this. The noodles were tender, seasoned thoughtfully, and reminded me of the type grandmother used to make for me as a boy. The highlight of the meal however was the string beans. Stir-fried to perfection, they came out bright, crisp, and succulent, and paired nicely with the fresh white rice.  It was truly odd to taste such authentic Chinese food out of plastic take-out containers because if I was blind-folded, the dinner could have very easily passed for a more upscale sit-down type of restaurant that would have charged me double for the same food.  A man who I believe is the owner checked in during our meal to ensure everything was to our satisfaction, and a darling elderly woman with a permanent smile made sure our cups were always full of water. This has permanently replaced Panda Express for me. Hopefully as time goes on the high quality will remain."}
{"text":"The place is a hidden gem! The lady working the counter is super nice!! Makes you feel welcomed upon walking in. Overall this place is pretty small, but most of the time people do take out orders. It's really clean!! The food tasted really yummy! I had the combo pad thai. Must try! Prices are really cheap and you get a good portion. Def will be back here"}
{"text":"Big servings of yummy Chinese food brought out from the kitchen piping hot!  The Triple Crown dish has a big assortment of beef, chicken, shrimp, water chestnuts, carrots, broccoli, and cabbage in a tasty sauce.  The Sweet and Sour Pork is huge even for two people, and is served with a separate dipping sauce so you can add as much or as little to each bite to taste.  Drinks are reasonably priced.  The friendly hostess checked in on us to make sure everything was good.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Nice little find. Went there based on the great Yelp reviews. Super friendly lady working there. We ordered 3 different items. 2 lunch specials and a dinner item. Our favorite was the Beef Pad Sea Ewe on the lunch menu excellent sauce and I love flat noodles. The egg drop soup was good also. The portions are very big for lunch and a great low price on everything on the menu. Nothing greasy like you would find at some quick take out places. We will be back to try other things on the menu. :)"}
{"text":"Hot and good. Posted a lot of pictures. People were friendly and so helpful. Highly recommend. Phad Thai was soo good. Egg rolls hot and yummy. Hot and sour soup wonderfully flavorful. Loved it all."}
{"text":"This Chinese spot is pretty good. I love ordering takeout from here, The food portions are generous and the food itself is very good definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Hands down a great place to go  Egg drop soup wonderful Lady behind counter was exquisite!!!!!!!!!! Go back in a heartbeat!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of a kind. Oasis is different because they inquire different types of Asians food; that being Thai, south eastern, Chinese- however they do not categorize as their own. They specialize it to be fitting of what their view of 'pad thai,' simply by adding \"style\" at the end. Per se.. -Thai style  -Chinese style  As their version of pad see eww may not be the traditional one you're used to, it's delicious. It's almost as if you mixed pad see eww and chow fun! We also got a curry and we were displeased because of its appearance. The curry looked rather watery than most but surprising it was so flavorful. It reminded me of an egg drop soup but, without the egg and more of a curry. The curry taste was there, the appearance was just different.  This place is def worth the try"}
{"text":"Ordered Triple Crown dish with fried rice and Hawaiian fried  rice...the fried rice was so salty that we couldn't finish it. My advice: get steam rice with your dish. Triple Crown had various veggies in it and heavily sauced. Nothing special about the Hawaiian fried rice...kinda taste bland. In my opinion, this is just pricy Chinese fast food quality and you wouldn't want to eat every week."}
{"text":"Great little find next to my fave Smiths. I always order the pad thai with shrimp and they aren't stingy with the shrimp at all. Lots of food always take some home!"}
{"text":"I highly recommended. My new favorite take-out food! Price is right. I have never had an issue with my order. Fast, friendly and courteous. The whole family can enjoy."}
{"text":"Based on all the great Yelp reviews, we decided to give Oasis a try. Very friendly staff!!! Great food! Super fresh and flavorful! Delicious!!! All the food came out hot! Hot & Sour soup was great! (I enjoy it w/o the seafood). Egg drop was also incredible! Loved the flavors of crab rangoons. They give a generous portion of rice. We were very happy for following the Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"I don't understand why I can't get spicy orange chicken in Las Vegas. I say I want it spicy that I want to sweat when eating it. They all say yes but I get sweet.  I miss Los Angeles - when I said spicy I would lose my eyebrows!!!  Egg drop soup was really good though"}
{"text":"I love this spot! Their food is so fresh. I usually get the chow fun, chicken fried rice and crab Rangoons. Everything is always so good! My food usually gets delivered before the time they say it will arrive so that's always great."}
{"text":"Food was good, customer service was good, but it was an inferno .... asked if ac was on ... told too hot and can't make a difference  ... Vegas heat!!! And you want customers.... need to make it comfortable.  Since food wasn't amazing, won't be returning"}
{"text":"It's a great to place to eat. The place is very clean.  The staff is very friendly.  Good food all around great for the price. Egg drop soup hits the spot."}
{"text":"Trying to eat a good Thai or Chinese on a Sunday can be a mission!!  Stumbled upon Oasis Asian  Kitchen while in the area!  #B106 on the corner by the Smiths.  A mixture of Chinese and Thai dishes were on the menu.  All under $10!  Lunch special for $6!!  A sweet lady Nancy took our order and showed us the cooler with a mixture of canned soda and Hawaiian sun juice!  We ordered: Rangoon - came out quick the were huge and they were good!!  Cooked perfectly!! Served with sweet and sour, Honey wings - crispy and smothered is a spicy sweet Saudi with sesame seeds!!  Yum, Pad Thai - this was my dish, it was good and there was lots  of chicken but the flavor wasn't authentic.  For $6 totally still worth it!  Mongolian Beef - delicious!!  The meat was good quality and the sauce was yummy!!Beef teriyaki - huge hunks of steak!!  Great quality!!  Fresh veggies!  We loved everything!!  Nancy was a pleasure to meet and gave excellent service!   We ordered a few things to go and our bill was only $50!!  Great place to bring the kids without spending a fortune!!"}
{"text":"What a find. Came because of the reviews and was not disappointed. Big plate of food with soup for under $6. Moo-goo-gai-pan probably the best I've tried in Vegas. And the sweetest woman behind the counter - I assume she is the owner. So attentive and very sincere! Will be back."}
{"text":"The food is amazing g.  The crab rangoon is to die for.  Egg rolls are fresh...  this my new Chinese restaurant"}
{"text":"Very very good food here. I love everything I order. It is a family ran business and they are so cute. Love the little lady in the front. I come here all the time."}
{"text":"My first visit, but so good I will become a regular. Reasonable prices, large portions, great flavor, fresh vegetables perfectly cooked. And this was the lunch special--I'm looking forward to trying some other dishes. I had the basil green  bean stir fry--several nice pieces of chicken, and the onions and carrots were nicely cooked (not overcooked), but the star for me was the green beans. So tasty, not mushy, just perfect. Great friendly service. Clean, and welcoming, not at all fancy--even when eating there you are served in to-go containers with plastic utensils. If you're Ok with that, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite to-go spots!! The grandma that works there is super hardworking and friendly... you walk in and she greets you right away.   I love the Singapore noodles and Basil Beef here... the prices are pretty cheap too! There's limited seating and it's very small, not the best place to seat and eat since the whole place consist of like 5 tables.   But the food is great I recommend this place !!"}
{"text":"Drove there for lunch special because of high ratings on yelp. I have to leave the review because it's not authentic Thai food. It's Chinese owned. Green curry chicken was not like Thai style but more of Chinese taste. Thai food is supposed to be cooked by Thai. Oops. Won't go again."}
{"text":"We tried Oasis tonight for dinner. Quick delivery. The food was hot and almost correct. We had asked for no onions on one dish and it was loaded. After we picked the onions off, the food was good. We had ordered vegetable egg rolls, hot & sour soup, chicken pad Thai and spicy Kung Pao chicken. Both dishes were ordered in a \"medium\" spicy and were not spicy at all. For a quick and close Thai cuisine, Oasis was a decent delivery tonight. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 dishes to-go. Was told 20-25 minute wait. Ended up waiting 50 minutes. Went up to check on order then she said it was ready. If I hadn't prepaid for the food already then I would have just left. If you want a quick to-go order then this is not the place. Will not return."}
{"text":"I haven't had much appetite these days due to stress. This by far has been one of thee best comfort food I have ever had in a very long time. I can taste the freshness and clean ingredients. The meats in all the dishes were tender. The vegetables were cooked perfectly. The flavor was spot on and even the Crab Rangoon was oozingly soulful. I absolutely loved every bite of it.  I ordered Crab Rangoon, Basil Fries Rice, Pad Thai, Pan Fried Crispy Noodle, Sesame Chicken, Happy Family-oriented pork, and Sweet Donuts.   The highlight was the Pad Thai. It had this flavor that was so addicting. And you get this heat.. This kick of spice that you prepare is coming with vengeance is just a delightful taste of comfort. Soothing and tasteful. Each bite was a rainbow of satisfaction. I can say this is the best Pad Thai I ever had. It's different from all other Thai restaurants I've been to and I've had my fair share of many!  Crazy part of all this is.. this was a delivery order. Came a few minutes early then my promised time. Nice, happy delivery guy. Great service all around. Couldn't have asked for a better meal to make my night."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a good Chinese restaurant and I think we finally found it! Service was excellent and the food was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Very clean place, the food is delicious and came out hot and fresh. The owners are very courteous and welcoming. I had tofu fried rice and my son ordered sweet and sour chicken with fried rice. Great portions as well. Highly recommended, I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Ordered general chicken meals tonight for dinner. Order was delivered. Pro: food arrived in 30 mins. Con: food was terrible. I'm from the south and never experienced chewy chicken.  How is that possible? In the trash and will not order from this restaurant again. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered orange chicken, cashew chicken and hot and sour soup.   Cashew chicken was on point.  Lots of veggies and good flavor.  Orange chicken was surprisingly delicious.  Big pieces of chicken breast. Not too sweet not too much breading.  Will order again."}
{"text":"I just moved around this neighborhood about a week ago, wanting some Chinese food from a week long of moving and unpacking. Thanks to all yelp reviews I found and settled with this place, and wow it surprised me it is amazing quality and deliciously made. I highly recommend this place! Please start delivering!"}
{"text":"I ordered shrimp pad thai, donuts, and crab rangoon today, and it was absolutely delicious. Everything cooked perfectly. This is my new go-to spot."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to try it out... ONE OF THE WORST MISTAKES OF MY LIFE! I would recommend steering clear of this place. We ordered 3 Pad Thai Chicken, 2 came with only veggies and the one right order came with chicken, however was it really chicken? The chicken was so microscopic it was as if it was like eggs beaten into the noodles, the stingiest amount of chicken I've ever seen. There were no solid chunks of chicken only microscopic pieces with no flavor or texture, the Pad Thai was made with the wrong noodles and was watered down, so the noodles were white and the sauce was all water drained to the bottom of the container. The only good thing we ordered here was the honey spicy chicken, the worst part of the meal was the \"Basil Fried Rice\" its in quotation because it's a sorry excuse for basil fried rice that makes you cringe with absolute terror. They should just label it as \"Steam Rice with Veggies\" I wish I took pictures to show how bad it was, but even though in our culture we don't waste food, we threw it all away. IT WAS THAT BAD. Avoid at all costs and do your family a favor and order from another Thai place! This place is a scam! I feel bad writing such a bad review, but this place honestly deserves it for serving poop to people. I would give less than 1 star if I could."}
{"text":"The owners changed & so did the food. Extremely disappointed with this place now. I ordered teriyaki chicken and what I got did not taste like chicken.  Very low quality meat. Their lo mein was okay, even the beef was odd."}
{"text":"I visit this place several times I guess this is the best Asian food you can find in this area everything is super delicious and the prices are super cheap and the owner very nice guy will always take care of you"}
{"text":"I have been in Las Vegas for 11 years and have ate at many Asian restaurants. Oasis is by the best restaurant I have ever ate at. The food is the freshest you will ever get in Las Vegas. Delicious. The owner and her son are the kindest most helpful in any restaurant that I have been in. You can dine in, Take out and they have catering. Even though I live a little ways away, I would never consider going anywhere else. You will not be disappointed. I promise. Prices are great and they have also have lunch specials. At the corner of Flamingo &Buffalo in the Smiths shopping center. A few doors down from Smiths."}
{"text":"Came here for what I like to call a \"loner lunch\"... The first thing I noticed when walking in was how good the food smelled and how impeccably clean it was. In my opinion the cleanliness was impressive, keep up the great job!  I ordered the Orange Chicken lunch special with fried rice and egg roll. At first sight of my meal I thought there should have been more orange chicken however as I began to eat my lunch I realized the pieces of orange chicken are really huge! Not like other places where you get a variety of different sized pieces of chicken where some are flavorful and others dried out. There was plenty of succulent flavor that enjoyed greatly.   Needless to say, but I will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Very good! Hubby and I split the crab rangoons, orange chicken (I mostly ate the broccoli) and some egg drop soup. It was so yummy and filling. The orange chicken was made well. There was more chicken than breading so that was a nice surprise. I liked the fact that it wasn't mushy at all. Hub also ordered fried rice but he wasn't as excited about it because he's used to the fried rice at pumi express better, but we loved everything else. The woman working was very friendly too:)"}
{"text":"I come here almost once a week for lunch, its right by my job. The owners are very genuine and sweet. The food is really good and affordable."}
{"text":"Just ate at Oasis Asian Kitchen for the first time and all we can say is \"AMAZING\"! We've eaten in all of the little in and out spots around China Town and this is the best by far. Prices are extremely reasonable and we still have the delicious flavors in out mouths and memories. \"A\" rated and spotlessly clean. Try it, you'll love it!!!"}
{"text":"Nice, small restaurant. Older Lady was nice and accommodating. The egg drop soup was thick but I cured that with a lil hot water. The orange chicken lunch was alright, the fried rice with the lunch special was hard and not too tasty. I'll have to come back for other dishes to really get a better taste. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"New owners!! I had a feeling they changed ownership because when I ordered food the last couple of times it didn't have the authentic Chinese taste to it like it used to but instead it taste bland and no flavor. Unfortunately I won't be coming back anymore, I tried giving it a few try's but the food still doesn't taste as good as the old owners used to make it. That's too bad because I thought we had finally found a good authentic Chinese tasting food."}
{"text":"I love the Basil String Beans. My favorite thing at this place & they give so much of it! The lady that works in the front is very nice & cute too ."}
{"text":"This is my new go to spot. The food is very fresh and not greasy. The crab rangoons are the best I have ever had ! Hot & sour soup is very good too!"}
{"text":"I usually find ordering pad thai at chinese restaurants is not a good idea, but this place was pretty good. Both the pad thai and green curry were a bit heavy handed, but very flavorful. They were not stingy with their shrimps in the pad thai, and were also impeccably cooked. The service was also very good, probably the most sweet and polite service i've had at a chinese restaurant of this price range. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great prices and the people working here are lovely. Oh - and the food is excellent as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food. It's always hot and fresh when delivered. There's not much else to say. I ordered general tsos with white meat chicken and was not let down. The egg and spring rolls are also very good. I highly recommend ordering from here."}
{"text":"This place used to be our go-to for a quick dinner fix. We loved the orange chicken, beef and broccoli, and the fried rice! The price was on point! Just a few months ago, we noticed the friendly lil ole lady was no longer at the counter. Anyway, we ordered our usual fixings and went home. Prices were the same, but we noticed that the quality of the food has definitely gone downhill. We are disappointed to say that we will not be returning to this establishment anymore."}
{"text":"We ordered the cashew chicken lunch special and teriyaki chicken bowl for lunch.  Everything tasted great!   The bowl included a side salad and the lunch special came with fried or steamed and a choice of egg drop soup out an eggroll. ... AND the lunch special was only $5.95!"}
{"text":"I had the orange chicken and family dinner and my girlfriend had the black pepper steak dinner honestly . The family is a portion size for two and the food was very delicious and filling.honestly one person can't finish one family dinner box . You just can't . This food wayyy better than Panda Express. Nice to know this place is open late night and staff was friendly accommodating with anything from Soy sauce to toothpicks. I felt very welcome . I will come again or just order from their pick up and delivery option . Since it's close to home I'll be picking up often! Cant wait to try other things on the menu 5stars hands down!"}
{"text":"After a full day trip in Grand Canyon, I had my dinner with my parents in Oasis. We had three different kinds of noodles here, and all of them are so great and definitely better than most expensive buffet places on the strip. The cost is lower than most of experience and the place is incredibly clean. The owner and crews here are doing great job!"}
{"text":"Love this place and the sweet old lady behind the counter. Love the Mongolian style beef and chicken, steamed rice, spicy honey chicken wimgs, orange chicken, lo mein, and my husband can't get enough of the shrimp pad Thai. I love that they carry the Hawaiian Sun drinks."}
{"text":"Oasis Kitchen looks to be a real mom-n-pop shop, with an older Asian lady manning the front of house and an older guy manning the back. I'm all for supporting local businesses, unfortunately I was underwhelmed with their product. Mongolian beef was excessively oily with a touch too much sweetness from the sauce, while the cashew chicken was bland. If I return hopefully my experience will improve."}
{"text":"OMG so good!!! Fresh, crisp veggies!!!! Clean environment, friendly service I ordered the TRIPLE CROWN CHEF SPECIAL..... Fabulous!!!!"}
{"text":"Love these guys . Been coming here for about 6 MO now and there always good and customer service is grateful to see you always . Food is consistently good . My favorite is the lunch special before 3 pm the beef and broccoli is way good ."}
{"text":"The king of four star reviews returns once again to hand out another four star special. There are a few unique things about this little hole in the wall. The first is that it may be some of the better Chinese food in Vegas. Although that says more about the poor quality of Chinese in Vegas than about how good Oasis is. Two trips to China have ruined me on Chinese food in the states. When a street cart vendor working the streets of Beijing can hand you better Chinese for than anything you have ever tasted in your life, you've been tainted to any future Chinamerica food forever. However, I was yet to find any Chinese food in Vegas I liked even before I took my trips to China. Another unique thing about Oasis is that it serves Thai food, but the owners are obviously Chinese (Cantonese I thinks). Usually Chinese places in Vegas are run by Thai with a few Chinese dishes on the menu. Here it's the other way around.  I had the Mai Fun noodles which used fresh veggies and had a good flavor. My constant companion, who I will refer to as Sancheta Panza to my Don Q, ordered the Orange Chicken and we were both pleasantly surprised. The Chicken had a lite, fresh flovar. The sauce was not overly sweet or syrupy thick. I got the impression that the chicken was cut and breaded right before it was fried up. The fried rice was nothing special, very functional, no flair or flavor beyond rice that had been fried.  Here is what I can say best about it, if I lived near The Oasis is would eat there a couple of times a week. I get the impression that a lot of people do. Sancheta and I dined in and as we were there we witnessed a steady stream of people come in to get orders to go. The lovely, and especially doting older Chinese lady running the place knew most of the customers by name as they knew her by name as well. That's a pretty good clientele report. I can't give this place less than a B as for a little hole in the wall Chinese place it's pretty darn good. For Vegas it's really good. For China...meh."}
{"text":"Exquisite Chinese/Thai cuisine. Very impressed with the flavor and amount of food for the prize. Good things come in small packages. Small little hole in the wall, with full flavor. Will definitely make this a frequent addition to my dining out rotation."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant with bright colors and bright family. The Pad Thai and Mongolian Beef was spectacularly delicious. Can't beat the lunch special prices either!"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely amazing!  Definitely a top 5 in Vegas. Amazing quality food awesome service and great location will definitely recommend this spot to anybody!"}
{"text":"Ok. So I just discovered this restaurant yesterday. My boyfriend got me lunch from here and I won't lie, I wasn't super thrill about it because of the lack of good Chinese restaurants in Vegas. I have to say I was amazed! The shrimp fried rice was very flavorful filled with shrimp in every spoonful and the orange chicken was MOSTLY  chicken, not breading with a splash of chicken, in a delicious sauce, not syrup. The food was so good i gained my appetite back for Chinese food in Vegas. I also went to the restaurant to thank the owners for the food and suggest yelp. Because Mom and Pops aren't too savvy about these things, I decided to do it for them. That is how good this place is! I should also add that the fortune cookie is very old school, filled with words of wisdom, Chinese tutoring, and my lucky numbers! I wonder what's the jackpot right now?"}
{"text":"This is very tasty basic Chinese food. We got crab Rangoon that actually had a crab flavor, the generals chicken was large chunks of white meat and not too bready, the Mongolian beef, fried rice and lo mein all had great flavor. Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Returned and again had the Spicy Kung Po as well as the Pepper Steak--see piks.  At 5p on a Friday expected it too be busy, but all 5 tables were empty and only a few showed up for take out orders while I was there...  Food was good, since I was eating there wish I got to eat on a real plate--I was given my order in the plastic take out containers...the Spicy Kung Po was definitely the better value over the Pepper Steak, but both were good."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious low key Chinese food. We ordered the Kung Pao shrimp and KP chicken with fried Rice/white rice. Such good quality from the meat to the vegetables. No salty, MSG free as well. The owners are such sweet older people and are very friendly and have warm smiles from beginning to end of dining experience. I found my new Chinese not in Chinatown. Small quaint place in a shopping center. Thanks to Yelp for recommending me to this wonderful restaurant. I'll be back very soon:)"}
{"text":"Took my kids here after seeing Yelp reviews and was not disappointed! This little family owned restaurant is great. It is mostly set up for take out orders, although it does have 4 small tables to dine in but everything comes out in to go containers and plates and utensils are all disposable. I must say that the food was made to order and came out fast and everything was delicious ! Prices were good. Definitely returning!"}
{"text":"Still amazing. Always fresh and tasty. Miss Nancy is my favorite aspect. Get to know her. It makes the experience even better. She really cares a lot that we enjoy her food."}
{"text":"My go-to Chinese takeout, delivery's always quick! (But I only live like a mile away :P ) My favorites are their hot & sour soup, pad thai, & mei fun"}
{"text":"This little restaurant is the definition of the awesome \"hole in the wall\" place.  First item:  both my husband and I have sensitive digestive systems and there were no repercussions, or in other words:  the food is good and pure and safe(and we are old foodies).  The service was charming, and fast.  We got the Red curry chicken and cashew chicken lunch specials.  The red curry was a definite \"go back for it again\" dish.  The Cashew Chicken was very tasty and the vegetables were clearly fresh and simple and just plain good.  Good texture and I could taste the actual  vegetable!  Not mushy or anything!  Please be aware that this is more of a take out place than a sit down restaurant so don't expect a white table cloth.  Two people for lunch  $15 out the door with a small tip.  The food was worth every penny.  Tell your friends about this place."}
{"text":"A true hole in the wall. The Singapore rice noodle had me licking the plate.   Will defiantly come back!!!!"}
{"text":"WARNING!... Food at this Location is Addictive!... Fabulous Cook, Great Service... and the Food is AMAZING!!!... I had the \"Thai Fried Rice\" again tonight...It's a Complete Meal, all alone... WOW!"}
{"text":"I came across this place on yelp as I was looking for a place that delivers and what a happy surprise. I had the crispy pan fried noodles  with shrimp and it was delicious. I also had the shrimp egg rolls which were tasty as well & hard to find in vegas. Hands down some of the best take out for the price. Friendly staff, what more could a girl ask for. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Incredible! So good! Ordered mei fun with pork & sesame chicken. I've tried several different Chinese food places within the 2 years I've lived here and have to say this place trumps any place I've been to in Las Vegas. If you have a hankering for some good Chinese be sure to hit Oasis Kitchen!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! My first time here. We ordered cashew chicken and fried rice. It was delicious. Will be going back. The lady at the register was so sweet. Very friendly people."}
{"text":"They are pleasant people who are very friendly. The food is delicious, hot and fresh. Was busy but made sure they talked to everyone. Try the place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good, delicious Chinese takeout I had -- fresh and tasty. They offer a number of Asian cuisines. WORD OF WARNING FOR YELPERS: I ordered thru Yelp and was told the food was ready in 45-60 minutes. Upon arrival the staff told me it was ready in 15 and they've heard the same complaint from other Yelp users."}
{"text":"Lunch Specials are daily. Located in the Smith's shopping center/ strip mall at Buffalo and Flamingo. There are a lot of small businesses, and this hidden gem is in between Smith's and Big 5 Sporting Goods (when facing Smiths, it's to the right, and Big 5 is on the right most corner).    We'd been in the area for a few months after I'd seen the sign because I stopped at that Chase that afternoon. After I showed my husband, he stopped to see it, but it was closed when he visited. I had it bookmarked.     A nice variety of lunch specials (back of the menu) ranging from $5.95 to $6.50. General menu items are Chinese (beef and broccoli, fried rice, egg rolls, wor won ton soup), Thai (pad thai, pad se ewe), and East Asian dishes. Prices vary for type of meat (tofu is also available), but aren't too bad if you want the shrimp ($10 range). The menu states they do not use any MSG.   Small, a total of five tables, inside seating only. It was packed on saturday for lunch. We got the big table, but we were the only family there. There were three takeout orders (popular, a good sign) while we were eating lunch. A sign on the wall showed the A rating. Clean place. There was a side counter with ice water, chopsticks, plastic ware, and chili sauce. The order counter is the back wall. Warm bright colors (yellow and orange- unexpected but a nice change from the norm) on the walls with framed pictures of popular dishes and vegetables. A TV was on, in one corner of the restaurant, showing the latest news stories. It's simple but it works well.   Service was very good. The two people up front were very nice. Our server kept checking in with us, too. (Eating here? Don't be surprised with the disposable plates and plastic forks.)   Hubby ordered the lunch special Beef and Broccoli and I was dying for crispy fried noodles with chicken and vegetables. I could see a glimpse (there was a drape separating the restaurant from the kitchen but it was short or something) of the cooks in the back kitchen working their magic. It didn't seem too long. Portions were generous. The crispy fried noodles were so yummy. It's a two-parter: pour the meat, vegetables, and sauce into the noodles (careful, it's HOT). You don't know how long it's been since we've had this dish! And I was so delighted that we finally found a worthy replacement (we've been looking since there was a major change to a casino cafe). We were really enjoying lunch. I love when there is a crispness to the veggies when you bit into it. And you know what, everything was good the following night, when we had leftovers.   We are most likely coming here again and again and again. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"The best lil spot in LV that I've found! Everything me and my wife have ordered has been delicious. My personal favorite is fried rice and extra spicy Mongolian beef. So if your looking for some good Chinese food, look no further! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Simple menu.  Easy to order. Every time I've visited Oasis it has always been for take-out. Unlike many other authentic Chinese restaurants, the lady answering calls and checking people out behind the register is easy to communicate with. She's very sweet and always makes sure to let me know the the food will take a while to be ready. And most of the time, it really does take a while to be ready. I usually order about three dishes and they have all taken half an hour at the least. Be patient though, because it's worth it.  Food is tasty and portion sizes are decent. My mother raves about the dry chow fun, while my father enjoys the pan fried noodles where they have the sauce on the side. The restaurant itself looks extremely clean and well kept. Definitely a mom & pop shop to support if you are in the mood for Chinese food :-)"}
{"text":"Great little cafe, food is very reasonable and good quality. Lunch specials about $6 and good size portions."}
{"text":"One of the yummiest Chinese food I have had here in Vegas and not what you would expect from a takeout place.  I always order the Triple Crown - a wok'd fresh veggie and meat/seafood combo dish. The flavor and ingredients together for their dishes pack a punch...definitely reminds me of my mother's Chinese dishes.  Super friendly service with the nicest mom running the counter and the son in the kitchen.  What more can you ask for?  I highly recommend this place if you want a quick and affordable yet totally yummy Asian place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic, the food was delicious, and the woman at the front was very kind. Never have I met a nicer server."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is great and fresh. Carry out comes in nice quality containers not white boxes which is awesome. The lady at service counter is awesome and always greets you like you are family. Not a big Asian fan but this place is the exception."}
{"text":"This place is ok Ordered take out and they got my order wrong? This girl was nice  But for the food It was pretty bland not very tasty It wasn't terrible  but it wasn't good I dont know why it got so many high reviews ?? That is the only reason i tried it?? Theres many more chinese places to eat that are good But i always like giving a new place a shot   More then likely will not be returning back to this place"}
{"text":"Love the food, the service (especially from the front, an Asian old lady who is very friendly and accommodating) and the tiptop cleanliness of the place! Expect a very good dining experience from this small but very decent place, and at a decent price too! Order the Green Thai curry and the crispy noodles very yummy!"}
{"text":"A family owned spot that's pretty much hidden. A place that's absolutely underrated. Staff seems to be elderly and they were absolutely nice and amazing. The food is fresh and you can taste how fresh and made to cook it is. The spot is kinda small but it's well kept & clean. The prices are fair and the quality of food speaks for itself. If you're ever near by & hungry, stop by! I recommend the Basil String Bean Chicken! You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"An extra star just because it's so hard to even find \"just okay\" Chinese food in Vegas.  Really, though, this place is a three star.  Most places here are dirty and the food is very greasy and old tasting, so I guess competence seems like something special.  I'm not sure why so many 5 star reviews, I've had better Chinese in my life and nothing was unique or extra good.  But it did taste reasonably fresh, it was all white-meat chicken without gristle or lots of fat, and the service is nice and friendly.  The food was ready very fast, as well.  I got sesame chicken and orange chicken.  The chicken pieces are very large, too much for one bite, but the breading is thick and mushy, not thin or crispy, and the sauces were mostly sugary, bland, normal Americanised Chinese stuff.  Just a couple of pieces of broccoli.  The portion is large, but so is the price.  Probably a better deal with the lunch special.  Not sure I'll be back, but I wish these guys luck, they seem very nice and hardworking, and I'm glad that people in Vegas have an option for less awful Chinese.  Give this place a shot and stop rewarding places with bad service and awful food."}
{"text":"I have ordered take out for myself and my husband from here. Having been from Hawaii where Chinese food is all over and very good, we have had bad luck finding a great place to eat. So when we found Oasis we were thrilled. Now we eat there a couple times a week. Love it and the service from the \"Mom\" who is at the front counter is fabulous. Check it out."}
{"text":"I ordered the Mongolian Beef with fried rice and one egg roll lunch special. When you order a lunch special you have an option of fried rice, steamed rice and a side of egg roll or egg drop soup. It's filling!!!  I can tell you that.   I was thinking they had Thai tea or something but no! ): i find it weird how they didn't have a drink selection on the menu. They actually have this small fridge and they do carry; Pepsi  Diet Coke Brisk Gatorade  7 Up Orange juice  Sprite  Bottle water Dr. pepper  All in a can or bottle.  Overall, the place is good. Food is good and filling. I'll come back to try something different."}
{"text":"Introduction: I was in the area for a meeting and didn't want to drive around cause I am not familiar with the area. Therefore, I decided to give Oasis a try due to convenience and the rest is HISTORY.   Customer Service: 5/5 I was helped by a super young lady at the register. She was friendly, efficient and effective.    Quality: 5/5 I got the Mongolian Chicken. I like the fact that you can make it in chicken versus your standard beef.  Most restaurants will not allow you to substitute beef for chicken whenever you order the Mongolian dish. Which I find tremendously annoying. In addition, I added broccoli to it and it was YUMMY!  Quantity: 5/5 I got the lunch special and according to the cashier, she said it's not as big as the A La Cart orders. In my opinion, it was a lot for a lunch special.  Price: 5/5 It's more like 10+. As previously mentioned above, I got the Mongolian Chicken with brocolli added for less than $8. Furthermore, you have the option to choose fried rice without extra cost.  In addition, there was only $1 extra for the vegetables.  They definitely do not believe in nickel and diming their customers.  Cleanliness: 4/5 The atmosphere was nice and quiet, even though all the tables and chairs were taken.  It was definitely clean, but appeared a little old, I think that's due to how long they've been in business I'm sure.  Some people can misinterpret this as dirty.  Tips: If you are planning to eat at the restaurant, think again. They were so busy that you need to ensure you have a back up plan to take your order to go if necessary. We had to do that because all the tables and chairs were taken."}
{"text":"I had the pad sea-ewe and it was delicious. Got take out. Order make quickly. Service was nice. Portion size good. A little bummed that it was made with broccoli and not broccolini. Odd that there was zucchini, but overall tasty. I've had a lot of paid sea-ewe with soggy noodles and these were cooked perfectly. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Wow! We have found a new Chinese take out restaurant! For a small takeout place, they are hitting the mark! Very good food, and super reasonable prices. There are a few tables to sit at, and the restaurant is super clean. We quit going to the take out place by our house as the food was super greasy, and the meat portions were progressively shrinking. The family had sweet & sour pork, rangoons, Thai fried rice, and beef with green beans (Very good!) The sauce for the S&S pork wasn't the usual blood red fake stuff, and was more like a home made sauce. The grandma who works behind the counter was sweet as pie, and very attentive to service.   Give this place a try and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"They do not take American Express! Also lunch ends pretty early so take advantage when you can! Too bad I can't eat here. Looks good! Hopefully someone else will take my money."}
{"text":"I have ordered the chicken fried rice,  Mei fun noodle,  green curry beef,  shrimp fried rice,  soups.  Every time I have ordered I have not been unsatisfied.  The woman behind the counter always is friendly and asks about my family.  This is some GREAT food and it's reasonably priced I mean it's cheap.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Best cheap Chinese take-out we have found in Las Vegas.  Friendly employees, quick service, and tasty food.  Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. What a great little gem this place is! Super clean. Great food and prices and the lady who works the counter is absolutely sweet!"}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews. This little family run restaurant is so good. I have tried a lot of different Chinese food restaurants in Las Vegas. This one is way above all of the others. The people that work there are so friendly. You can tell they love what they are doing. Please try it. You won't be disappointed and you can feel good about supporting a new small business. EXCELLENT FOOD!!"}
{"text":"I love going here plus i work in the same area so the owners always know my order lol. The pad thai is amazing and so are the chicken wings. Also the egg drop  soup is pretty good when i want something light. My favorite item on the menu would have to be lemon grass chicken"}
{"text":"We have been there twice and will definitely go again.  Very clean and the lady behind the counter couldn't have been sweeter.  You get a lot of food, we made two meals out of our lunch.. Prices are very reasonable.  Both lunches had lots of fresh veggies and meat was tender.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We have been going here for the last few years the food was great, left town for a few months ordered from oasis today apparently the owners retired, the food we received was the worst I have ever had chicken wings burnt to a crisp, crab Rangoon raw fried rice raw crispy noodles burnt. So disappointed on how the food quality is non existent since the nice couple retired we will never go to oasis kitchen again. Just a sad state of affairs"}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 91/100***  My mom stumbled upon this little gem last week when she was getting her nails done. She brought home an order of Orange chicken, Pad Thai and a Chicken teriyaki bowl. I didn't try it until the following day for lunch, when I went home, I had to ask her where she got the food from because I was quite impressed with the taste. Since then I had the place bookmarked to try.  Yesterday after church, since we were in the neighborhood and since I've been craving their food we decided to order dinner here. At around 5:30 the place was empty, as soon as we walked in we were greeted warmly by this older Asian lady, very sweet and timid. The place is tiny but very clean, no clutter seen anywhere and they have an A grade to boot, for those of you that are dubious lol.   We got the Basil String bean stir fry with Chicken ($8.75), Orange Chicken ($8.50), Pad Thai chicken and shrimp combo ($9.45) and a cup of egg drop soup ($1.75) comes with 2 large carton of rice. All that deliciousness set us back $30.75 very affordable given the quality and huge portions they give you. Everything tasted so good and fresh, they don't add MSG on their food so that definitely is a big plus. Nothing oily and didn't give me a sluggish feeling after I ate. Their Orange chicken doesn't taste artificial and with just the right amount of sweetness unlike the one I just had the day before yuck! Pad Thai was very flavorful with an abundance of everything. I noticed they don't skimp on ingredients here thus the very tasty offerings. They also offer great value on their lunch specials, everyday from 11-3 most items priced at $5.95 and some $6.25 and comes with rice, egg roll or soup.  I now have my go to place for Chinese/Thai cravings. YAY!"}
{"text":"staff are very nice and what a great customer service. food is awesome and the place is kept clean and maintain. try it, you wont be dissappointed."}
{"text":"If I could I wouldn't even give this place 1 star. My wife and I have gone to Oasis Asian Kitchen for years. We went there tonight to order family dinner ($100). When we arrived we noticed that something wasn't right in the place. The old lady wasn't there to greet us and her son wasn't in the back cooking. We shrugged it off as we never went on a Saturday before. When we got to my in-law's we opened up the containers we noticed the food was dark brown. The General Tao chicken was brown as poop  and chewy, orange chicken tasted like rye bread, the crab rangoon was all onion, and fried rice was burnt. We called the restaurant back and requested to return the food and get a full refund. The first call they agreed on on the refund. As we were packing up the food I got a call from Oasis advising that it isn't their fault their food doesn't taste good and they aren't going to refund us the money. I told the girl then I will be calling our bank and dispute the charge. Then the girl and few others started to argue in the background in Chinese. She came back on the phone and said bring the food in and we will refund you. As my sister in-law and I got into the car to return the food the girl from Oasis called me with an attitude. She started yelling at me that this is their family recipe and how dare we not like their food. It is our problem and they are not going to refund our money. Well guess what the bank has been called and the charges has been disputed. Thanks for the free liter of Coke."}
{"text":"This place is very clean and the people are very nice. We had the best orange chicken we've ever had!   MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Order take out... from Eat24. The Pad Thai had this watered down sauce? Just tasted like plain rice noodles."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place it's very small and clean with a cute little old lady taking orders.  I tried the chicken kung pao which i really liked and the hubby ordered the Mongolian beef which is soo good.  The only thing i didn't like was their fried rice it is very bland and very eggy..  but i would still go back and order steam rice instead."}
{"text":"The food here was awesome!  We've had the Chow Fun, Orange Chicken, some kind of vegetable dish, tofu, fried rice, and other stuff I can't remember...but everything tastes great!  They give a decent amount of food for the price.  The downside is that the place is VERY small.  I have a family of seven, and we take up half the seating when we eat there.  So we usually just order take-out!"}
{"text":"If I could give them ten stars I would !!! Nancy is the owners mom and she is so wonderful, cute and so nice   .I will continue to come here !!  It's affordable and they give you large portions !!!  What's even a bonus about this place is none of there food contain m.s.g"}
{"text":"Very good food. Flavorful and fresh. The customer service is excellent. Best Chinese I have had in the 17 years I've been in Vegas."}
{"text":"Thank you Oasis for being consistent in your food preparation and pricing!!! My grandma and I love your food. Every time I walk in I'm greeted and it's always very clean and well kept which makes it even easier for my return."}
{"text":"Coming in, the place is pretty clean, new. Only been open 1 1/2 years.  Menu is simple and reasonable with a few Thai items. Service was nice and fast.  We ordered the lunch special at $5.95 a piece, it comes with rice, and choice of egg roll or soup. Food was served hot, not too sweet, salty or greasy.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Just making sure people in this area are aware of this gem. Top shelf! Spring mountain now extends to buffalo and flamingo. Highest endorsement."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, made to order! Best Chinese food I can find in town comparable to the Bay Area! Sweet owner in the front :)"}
{"text":"Empty restaurant no customers. 'Mom doesn't like rice can we have noodles instead'. 'No no can substitute. Come with rice', 'we don't want rice', 'oh, sorry'. Well piss off, we are going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in town, this place is a hidden gem. Love the little old lady who works at the front. Have to try the orange chicken"}
{"text":"What an awesome little find! I truly cannot believe that I've lived down the street from Oasis for 2 years and never once tried it!   I ordered my food direct from the Yelp app (woot woot!) and by the time I drove down the street to pick it up it was sitting on the counter, tied up and ready to go! She seemed genuinely pleasant, despite it being close to closing and even addressed me (quizzically) by name before presenting me with my food and making sure I didn't forget the sauce!   For $12 I got the most tender, delicious chicken and fresh veggies I've EVER had from a \"Chinese Takeout,\" a crunchy, egg roll and a cup of WonTon Soup that actually had several tasty wontons in it with a broth that was more than just bullion water.   But the rice. THE PORK FRIED RICE. I had to portion it out for myself because it was SO good that I could've just eaten that for dinner and said screw it to the rest of the meal I ordered. The rice was perfectly cooked and the pork was generous strips and not just cheap tidbits.   Across the board, nothing was too salty or syrupy, as is often the case with Asian Cuisine. Everything truly tasted fresh and made-to-order (again, despite ordering within an hour of closing time.)   I took my order to-go, and probably would never dine-in, since the restaurant itself isn't much. But don't think for a second that detracts from the taste or your bang for your buck.   With a wide variety of menu options, this is definitely my staple go-to Chinese spot in town!"}
{"text":"Absolute favorite place to eat out. Healthy and well cooked food.   I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Great fresh food! Love them! They are the cutest and have great service! We got the beef and broccoli and sweet and sour chicken! Both really tasteful! Probably the only sweet and sour chicken I'll ever eat. Also, their fortune cookies are good. Go visit and try, you will be greeted by the nicest most genuine people you will ever find in a restaurant. I will for sure go back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat for lunch or dinner, to dine in or for take out. The food is good the Asian lady who takes our order is kind and patient. The spicy chicken wings are unbelievably good, I will dine here again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I called to see if they delivered, the lady said no. Shorty after a gentleman called me back and said hed be willing to deliver if it was more then 20$ This food is the Best Asian food iv had since moving to Nevada!! The crabmeat wontons are to Die for!! This is the first place that makes them like back East... maybe even better. All the food was fresh. We will Soo Ohh be going here again."}
