{"text":"I want to be supportive of the kosher establishments in town because there aren't a lot of them and and there is a need for kosher dining options. And this is coming from someone who doesn't keep kosher.  Housed inside the Jewish Community Center (JCC) they maintain their own hours of operation. The hours are posted, but irregular at best. Sometimes they're open...sometimes they're not, despite what the sign says. And even when they're open, you never know what the kitchen will be serving. I've come to eat on more than one occasion (when they're \"open\") only to be told that the kitchen has been shut down early or that they've run out of signature, kid-friendly items. The owners once suggested that I call ahead to place my order to ensure that what I want is ready when I arrive. I tried to do that, only to be rather rudely told that the kitchen was closed \"because they had something else going on.\" All they had available were a handful of cold items. When they're open and working with a full kitchen the food is pretty good. Salads, sandwiches, pizza pasta, etc. I personally love the tuna on challah and my kids like the pizza.

 Which brings me to customer service. More often than not, the staff at Levi Catering is rude, disrespectful and downright nasty. I've called to order and been hung up on. I was yelled at by a staff member in front of other customers after questioning the inconsistency of their hours and told that \"I must not have any friends\" and \"Who plans their day at eating at the cafe?\" They never smile. They never greet people. And they always act as though they're being inconvenienced by basic request. Customer service is an oxymoron, although there are small glimmers of hope. I've spoken with others and eaten there enough to know that my experience is not unique. Although convenient, after a particularly horrific customer service experience several weeks ago I vowed never to go back. Levi Catering operates inside the JCC but is independently owned and managed and I truly believe Levi Catering remains open out of sheer necessity. The staff behaves reprehensibly because they can... as long as there is a captive audience of hungry JCC members, staff, guests, swim team families etc. who eat at Levi Catering out of convenience they feel they can run their cafe business however they want. In fact, the manager(?) once told me that \"We can do whatever we want because we're not part of the JCC.\" I complained to the JCC about my last incident with Levi Catering and despite assurances to the contrary, I never heard back and to my knowledge no action was ever taken. If they were a stand-alone restaurant they would have gone out of business a long time ago.

The food isn't bad, but I just can't support a business with such little regard for customers and customer service."}
{"text":"Although the evening was beautiful I was disappointed with the quality.  The potatoes ibn the potato salad were hard and the chargers placed under the dishes on the table were returned dirty.  They were not even wiped off.  As for payment be very careful.  She would not meet with me as arranged to complete payment until the middle of the party.  I was given a piece of construction paper with numbers scribbled on it.  I was told I would get an itemized bill in my email which never happened.  I thought the bill was high but I wanted to get back to my guests so i reviewed the bill the next day.  I noticed I was overcharged so I have attempted to contact them several times about the overpaying and lack of cleaning the chargers.  The party was three weeks ago and I have not yet to receive a response to any of my questions."}
{"text":"My experience with Levi Catering has been EXCELLENT!  I co-chaired a 300 person event in January 2013 and everything went beautifully.  The food was amazing, the service was great, AND the attention to detail was second to none.  People raved about the event and the food afterward.

Working with Leah (owner/manager) was a pleasure; she was kind and considerate.  She guided us to make choices that would be most palatable to our guests and worked with us to set up the event in the best possible way.  Her pricing was fair and when we received the final bill, it was exactly as quoted.  

The folks at Levi Catering took ALL THE EXTRA STEPS to make sure our event was a success!!!

I am co-chairing the same event next year and look forward to working with Leah and Levi Catering again!

Note about the cafe: It serves its purpose and the food is good.  It feeds my kids when I forget lunches at home, pours me a cuppa coffee when I want to shushkie with friends, and provides me a night off from cooking from time to time.  Recommendations: Yoga Girl Salad (tuna over lettuce with sunflower seeds) and the Moroccan carrots (TDF)."}
{"text":"Levi Catering catered my daughter's bat mitzvah.  The event was amazing.  The food was delicious, plentiful, and beautifully presented.  It was a joy to work with them, especially Leah.  When our synagogue began to hold monthly dinners, I was very quick to ask Levi Catering to provide the food.  To date, each of the sixteen dinners was delicious.  The whole coordination of the head count, menu, and food set up has been stress fee.  We have always had enough food, even with unexpected guests.  I have given out Levi Catering's name and number to many of our congregants and friends.  I always know when I see Leah, Levi, and Jacqui at an event, I will get a warm smile and a really delicious meal."}
