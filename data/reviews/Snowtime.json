{"text":"This new bingsoo location is stellar! Interior is modern, service is hospitable, snow is delicious! Can't wait to try the small baked goods available as well."}
{"text":"10/10 RECOMMEND
Ordered the GOLDEN DUST and the TIRA MISS YOU and it was so good!
The staff is very friendly and nice. The girl working in the front was happy to help explain the menu to us. Definitely will be back to try something new :)"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! My mom and I came in to give it a try and we were blown away! It is super clean, and very open. It was freaking delicious! I don't even know how to describe the texture other than that it was extremely delightful and pleasing to the pallet! This frozen white powder is my new crack cocaine!!! I AM IN LOVE!!!! Also, it's completely wheelchair accessible!"}
{"text":"Very friendly owner and very very good Golden Dust. The snow is perfect and the store is bigger than I thought! Great music and lovely atmosphere. You gotta try it out!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable! The ladies in there are extremely friendly and nice. The dessert I had was really good too!"}
{"text":"Super cute place! Right next to an awesome Korean restaurant, this place satisfies any sweet tooth without being overly sweet. With interesting takes on pat bing soo (Korean shaved ice) there are so many things to try! My friend had the Matcha Love and said it was a combination of all her favorite stuff (green tea, red bean, mochi, etc)--her perfect dessert! The proprietor is a cute Korean lady who is basically twinsies with my mom it's uncanny."}
{"text":"Super cute interior and the staff is very nice!! The dessert is delicious I got the Miss You Matcha, it had green tea ice cream, green tea mochi, red bean, and matcha powder, which was absolutely delicious! The prices are also very good would totally recommend!! :)"}
{"text":"What a wonderful atmosphere. My wife had the TiraMissYou and half of me green tea Matcha Love.  We highly recommend this cozy cafe if you're looking for coffee, espresso, tea, and some traditional shaved ice with a delicious contemporary twist."}
{"text":"Delicious! Highly recommend. Best snow place I've experienced around here. Their ingredients are fresh and of high quality. For example, their mochi is from a Japanese bakery. Noticed an immediate difference in taste and texture, unlike the mochi typically found at other snow or frozen yogurt places. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Make your own bingsoo! Delicious!! Fresh ingredients and lovely presentation! Friendly staff."}
{"text":"We were greeted by two nice ladies. We ordered the fruit bingsoo & the bingsoo was very light & creamy. I have had Korean patbingsoo before & their bingsoo is very good. The only down side is the bingsoo is pricier than expected."}
{"text":"This bingsoo place has to be the best, I've ever been to in AZ. The ice is finely shaved and melts in your mouth. The interior is cutely decorated and is spacious. They made it super fast too! The lady who works there(owner?) is extremely nice and welcoming. I recommend getting the golden dust!!"}
{"text":"I've been to many snow places in AZ and this one wins by a landslide.

Where do I start??? Everything about SnowTime is so perfect. 

If you're new to Korean bingsoo... They serve finely shaved ice (snow), desserts, and café drinks. You have the option of choosing from one of their signature snow creations or make your own using the listed toppings. Something I haven't seen before at other places is the scoop of vanilla ice cream and condensed milk that is served with all of their creations. Usually, ice cream is not even an option and condensed milk counts as a topping. Once you figure out what you want to eat, you have 3 sizes to choose from: small, medium, and large. I chose the Tira-Miss-You and my brother and friend both got the Matcha Love in small sizes. It was the perfect serving size for one person. Although, I'd still be able to eat the large by myself because it's sooo good. The Tiramisu cake on my bingsoo tasted impeccable and the strawberry on top of it complemented it perfectly. Matcha Love was no less. The Matcha was authentic and the toppings that went with it tasted amazing together. Look for photos I uploaded!

The décor is simple yet beautiful, even in the bathroom! My favorite is their board that holds pretty little cards with encouraging and positive messages...and then there was one odd self-promoting attorney business card. The place is extremely neat and well kept. As you walk towards the back, there are 2 separate but connected rooms which have dining tables for larger groups. It's cozy and inviting. Secret: They have wi-fi :)

My absolute favorite part of our visit here were the two sweet ladies who ran the shop. They made sure we liked everything and were very kind. They let us try some toppings (Gold Dust) before we ordered.  She even came by and added more condensed milk to my friend's Matcha Love!

Before we even finished our desserts, my friend and I were already planning our next visit...you should too!"}
{"text":"Great place with super friendly service. I love their Tira.Miss.You which is a tiramisu cake with cocoa dust, chocolate drizzle, and of course snow. I recommend coming here after dinner for a fun, cute place to satisfy that sweet tooth."}
{"text":"This is an interesting little place in Chandler that I tried out today with my husband and my friend.  I had the black sesame snow and it was really good.  My friend had the matcha love, which was also excellent.  I'm not sure which one I liked best.  I got a size small and that was plenty big. My husband tried the soft serve in a fish cone and he really enjoyed it.  I don't live in the east valley, but if I did, I would definitely frequent this spot on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I usually don't get snow but when I do, I come here! They offer almond milk and coconut milk. They're snow desserts are not overly sweetened. I got the aloe green tea, I wish it had aloe vera chunks but instead it was just a concentrated gel they had, bummer! But they're Matcha Love was yummy! I want try double Oreo snow, miss you matcha, and a fish cone!"}
{"text":"I feel a summer addiction developing. My husband ordered the matcha/taro swirl in the fish cone with black sesame dust (any place that has a flavor like black sesame is an automatic 5 stars in my book). I got the bingsu \"snow\" with lychee, strawberries, pocky, and coconut milk. I don't think it's worth wasting one of your toppings on the pocky since you only get 2, and they're frozen and hard. I would suggest getting another fruit instead. The shaved ice has the same texture as powdered snow and is amazing on a 115 degree summer day. I'm super sad that they don't have a dairy-free ice cream option, but I love bingsu so I guess I'll survive. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Instagrammable, Korean, they were playing Christian rock softly over the speakers when we were there

Service: Easy to see how they work behind the counter. Made effort to ensure presentation was picture-worthy. 

Food/Drink: Got matcha soft serve in a warm fish-shaped bun--fantastic. Got golden fish buns filled with custard, taro and red bean paste. Reminded me of Taiwanese pancakes.

Heads-Up: If you're ordering to-go, make sure to tell them because the snow is served in glass bowls. Parking in front of the place is limited but there are more spaces in the plaza.  

This Place is For You If: 
-You enjoyed watching The Shape of Water (2017) 
-You've mastered the ability to take a good Insta pic while holding a rapidly melting ice cream in the other hand
-You're out with the squad and one wants bingsoo, another wants Taiwanese pancakes and the other just came back from studying abroad and wants to overly explain what an affogato is to someone, anyone. 

This is where you go."}
{"text":"Good dessert, very tasty. I've been there 3 times, tried 3 different things, and enjoyed them all."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!
Cute and delicious dessert for everyone! 
Clean space, and nice owner make this place wonderful! 
Definitely coming here again with my friends 
especially in Arizona, this place will make Your summer 10 times better!"}
{"text":"The service here was very friendly, patient, and considerate when interacting with me. The interior of the place is adorable and is ideal for going with friends to just hang and talk. I got the Matcha Love Snow and I absolutely loved it. The snow itself is milk-based and isn't specially flavored. Its soft and fluffy texture gave me the sensation of eating actual snow, which was very cold and refreshing. It paired well with the flavors of the matcha and red bean. So choose carefully what toppings you want cause I think thats where most of the flavor kicks in. There's even a bottle of condensed milk by the counter for when you want to drizzle extra on your snow! As for portions, I got a small for $4.50 and it filled me up well. An overall great experience for my first time here :)"}
{"text":"Came here this past weekend and got the matcha love for roughly $5 in the small size. BE WARNED! The small was huge! My friend and I shared it, and we still couldn't finish it. But no complaints because the taste was excellent. I personally do not like anything too sweet. Fortunately, the sweetness level for the matcha love was perfect. It has red beans, matcha powder, mochi, and green tea ice cream on top of a bowl of snow ice. 

Someone else in the group got the taiyaki matcha which is a pancake shaped in a fish with the matcha ice cream on top of it. It looked super good so I'll have to come back and get it next time. 

Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Came here to try the new matcha soft serve and I was not disappointed! I love the taiyaki and snow as well. They have a very abundant selection of Asian toppings and desserts. 

Service and atmosphere are also great. This is my new favorite dessert spot in the area!"}
{"text":"Super cute interior, really friendly staff who will explain all the options, and delicious snowball concoctions! I got the matcha (green tea) tiramisu snow, a layered dessert of green tea, a fluffy shaved iced snowball, a scoop of matcha ice cream, condensed milk, and pieces of frozen tiramisu with a delicious sour cherry on the top. It's light and fun, sweet and frozen, a perfect additional to any Arizona day. Personally, I can't wait to go back to try to black sesame and coffee options! The small size was for one was pretty big actually and they have two larger sizes that would be great to share."}
{"text":"Had the green tea and the fruit bing soo. Shaved ice. It was very good. Toppings were fresh. Haven't had the coffee, but will try next time."}
{"text":"We were greeted by a lady who was very friendly. She showed us sample drinks since it was our first time and gave us a run down of their products. We ended up ordering Tita-Miss-You and Double Oreo, along with a custom-built order of mango, banana and cheesecake. They were all really tasty, but the custom order was my favorite. It's a nice combination of fruits and milk to satisfy a sweet tooth without being too heavy. Can't wait to come back to try other combinations!"}
{"text":"I tried the tiramisu flavor and it was delicious! What an adorable little shop. Menu has plenty of choices and they even have lattes. Can't wait to try more"}
{"text":"Tiramisu snow YUM! So so good. And 99 cent americano. Can't wait to come back for the green matcha snow."}
{"text":"This place is the best!  The staff is amazing and the snow is delicious!! The owner puts in so much effort into the presentation of the snow as well! Love it here!"}
{"text":"It's snowing.

Maybe not from the sky but you can get some snow in your bowl. We're talking about Korean bingsu! Here at Snowtime, you can get a tasty bowl of milky powdery snow with a lot of great mix-ins like fresh made espresso, Kochi, golden dust, fruits, etc. If you don't want to think about a flavor combination, you can get one of their premade combinations. We've tried all their snow creations and there really isn't a bad one. Their drinks are pretty good as well. We especially like the sweet potato latte and the dirty matcha latte. We've recently have gotten addicted to the golden fish buns with cheese. They also recently started serving the soft-serve fish buns.

This is a really clean and modern space with a friendly staff. Don't forget to grab a punch card. The wife likes it here so I'm sure we'll be here a lot. It's always time for Snowtime."}
{"text":"Finally got to try the @snowtimeaz fish cone ice cream and I'm happy to say they did not fail to impress me, once again. The matcha ice cream wasn't overpowering and was perfectly creamy which I liked. The fish cone was also crunchy on the outside and beautifully soft on the inside. Finally, the custard filling wasn't too sweet which was nice because my aunts even enjoyed it and they don't have much of a sweet tooth. I'm just thankful that I don't have to make any trips to Cali for some fish cone ice creams because of this. So, definitely go grab one because you don't wanna miss out!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out because the boba shop across the street was voluntarily closed for the weekend. 

Between my friend and I, we ordered the matcha love and tira miss you. I think that the tira miss you would have been better with coffee/mocha flavored ice cream and I wish they had boba as an option for the drinks. 

The atmosphere is inviting, however; during my visit, their music kept cutting in and out. It also sounded like they had the same four mash ups on repeat. Being a new shop, I could see potential."}
{"text":"This was so nice to have on a warm day! Since it was our first time here and never having had shaved ice like this before, we didn't know what to get. The owner was so nice and patient!"}
{"text":"I'm not much a dessert person but this place is very good! I'm glad at tried this place because I've tried other snow ice shave place and it's not comparable to this at all. Their ice is made from some sort of milk so it adds so much flavors to the toppings. I got their matcha one and it mix so well together. The matcha didn't taste so strong and it was just perfect! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Paired with friendly customer service, an inviting atmosphere, and delicious desserts. This new cafe is highly recommended for those who like to cool down in the AZ heat. I recommend the green tea snow. The taiyaki soft serve ice cream is probably one of the best things to get. The matcha/taro swirl is really good. Getting the matcha dust on it add extra flavor as well! It's really photogenic too"}
{"text":"Wow!  This place blew my mind! I've never had snow before and I was sweetly surprised! I stopped in after eating dim sum with my family.  I tried the #2 Matcha Love, and boy did it live up to its promises!! Here, they offer of course Snow Bowls as well as coffee and tea."}
{"text":"Needed my boba fix so I stopped by here on a weekday. Place was packed with people and seemed like a good hangout spot. Service was warm and friendly. 

I tried the small Lychee green tea with lychee jelly - less ice and sugar. You can really taste the tea flavor and does not feel artificial at all! I tend to get less sugar in most boba places because they are usually too sweet (especially with jelly) but I would say get normal sugar here.

Parking right in front of the store was full, but it's part of a big plaza so there's plenty of parking available."}
{"text":"If you love maccha(green tea) ice cream and red sweet beans that's the awesome shaved ice cream style. Its shaven, like really thin ice, and then they put ingredients highly recommended."}
{"text":"Double Oreo? Lychee jelly and strawberries with fruity pebbles? Condensed milk for some extra goodness? Okayyyy!

Visited this spot a couple times now when I'm visiting Arizona and haven't been disappointed.  

Service is great too!!! So friendly! 

Oohhh great macaroons!"}
{"text":"This shaved ice is so incredibly fine, it's smooth and feels like an ice cream! No hard chunks of ice, great flavor! The girl working the register was helpful and knowledgeable"}
{"text":"The owners here really go above and beyond. They respond to critiques on Yelp to improve themselves and the lady there is one of the nicest hardest working people I've ever seen in my entire life. I really recommend their peach oolong tea. All of their teas are steeped to order and all of their milks are poured fresh into the machine. Haven't seen a single person walk out of here without a smile. If you're new, just let them know and they usually have pre made examples in the freezer to explain how everything works. They also carry decaf now in response to previous Yelp reviews. Love this place"}
{"text":"Very nice place. The ladies there are probably nicest people in the world. 
We got the #1 snow. It was so delicious.
We'll definitely be back to try all other flavors.

Highly recommended:)"}
{"text":"I like creativity in creating different types of snow, ofd combination. However, the snows are quite flavorless. They tasted like ice. The portion is big enough and my friend couldn't finish a small."}
{"text":"Brand new place. Super cute atmosphere with great desserts and drinks. We tried the lychee green tea and it was good. Tried the soft serve fish cone with matcha ice cream and for toppings we got custard mini mochi and macaron. The ice cream and the fish shaped waffle was amazing! Loved it! Just the macaron was little old. We also tried the Fruitilicious snow which came with seasonal fruits and scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was great and refreshing. Would come back here."}
{"text":"Cute set-up with plenty of seating and dessert sizes and options.  Come and checkout this new icy treat technology.  It's cool and delicious."}
{"text":"i want to post my picture but i accidentally deleted it. but im in love with the \"Tira MIss You\" snow ... best snow ever!!!! definitely recommend it. however you have to eat it there. it is much more appealing to stay and eat. to go is not so fancy, but eating there its like art and its soooooo good!!"}
{"text":"There is no longer need to get snow anywhere else ever again in Phoenix.  Unlike other artificially flavored snow, theirs taste natural and with high quality ingredients.  Perhaps that's how Korean bing su is, but I haven't had it enough times to say.  I ordered the small Golden Dust and regretted not getting a larger size.  The finished product is just a beauty with the delicate Golden Dust on top.  The snow itself is super fine and remains snowy like that of Snoh and unlike a lot of other places whose snow is weirdly chewy.  The milk snow is then topped with sweet red bean and super soft Korean rice cake pieces, followed by a scoop of vanilla ice cream, then a caramel (maybe?) syrup, finally finished with that magical bean powder aka golden dust.  Every bite of it was heavenly and it was so light and fluffy that it disappeared before I knew it.  I tried a bite of my friend's Matcha one and it was equally amazing even though I'm not a green tea person.  

We happened to go when their AC was down so it was very hot but the lady promised that \"it will be much cooler when you eat your snow!\" with a big smile and checked on us multiple times."}
{"text":"It is a very nice cold dessert treat for the family in the hot days after having Dim Sum next door. There was line-up for ordering and waiting for the preparation of shaved snow..."}
{"text":"This spot is pretty new and they have a lot of room to keep growing. The menu options are solid and if you have a sweet tooth, they will take care of that for you. Friendly group of individuals there and they guided me through the menu for it being my first time."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and staff was very friendly and helpful. I got the matcha snow and she got the espress-sno. Both tasted great and had was very refreshing."}
{"text":"Had a really great visit to this place for the first time yesterday. My friend and I stumbled in and decided to try something new. The woman at the register was very kind and held a great conversation with us. I tried the dirty matcha latte and I fell in love. When I'm in the area I shall always visit Snowtime."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Snowtime and it was AMAZING!!

Snowtime serves Ice cream, snow, teas and coffee concoctions. Snowtime is located in Chandler off of Dobson and Warner in the popular Lee Lee's plaza. 

I ordered the infamous fish cone twist with taro and matcha. Adorned it with oreo crumbles along with Pocky and finally filled with custard. The mix of the two flavors was perfect especially since I haven't had soft serve of either of those flavors. The fish cone was light and fluffy with a little bit of a crispiness, almost similar to a waffle. The custard filling just made it even better. The price value was well worth it and i am thinking of getting another one right now. Super clean and large interior to hangout with friends. There is even a back study room to have some privacy. 

Give Snowtime some love, it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"I visited this place for the first time while looking for a place to study. I was with a friend and we ordered a bowl of shaved ice with strawberries, fruity pebbles, red bean, and sweetened condensed milk. It took less than 5 minutes for the order to be finished (though I wasn't keeping track of time so I'm not sure how much time to took exactly). The shaved ice itself was delicious and milky. I thought it was sweet enough and not overloaded with sugar. My friend and I split the middle size, but I could have probably finished it off if I wanted to.

The ambience of the place is very nice. The interior is cutely decorated, and there are two rooms in the back for more privacy from the main area. We studied in one of these rooms for a few hours. They played soft piano music, which helped us concentrate on our studies. I would love to come back again, whether to study or to have delicious bingsoo"}
{"text":"Owners are super sweet. The place is clean and the desserts are delicious! Their snows and teas are great and you can customize the snow however you like."}
{"text":"I wished I lived nearer Chandler just so I can go here all the time. The moment you walk in, you're graced with a sweet, pleasant aroma that can immediately put you in such a good mood. In the multiple times I've visited, I love how the owner or the cashier greets you when you walk in with a kind of adorable excitement. 

I have a sweet tooth and I love that their snows aren't overbearing in their sweetness levels. It's the perfect amount and since it's shaved milk, the sweetness is tweaked by the different toppings you get. My favorite is the Golden Dust, but I like replacing the mochi with the cereal to give it a bit of a crunch.

Since I live in Glendale, the far drive is painful, but once I take a bite of Snowtime's sweet treats, the thought of driving back in rush hour traffic during a weekday isn't that bad, I guess. :)

(ps. ask for a sticker so you can put it on your laptop or something)"}
{"text":"10/10 the customer service was so good she was so attentive and sweet and the snow was amazing seriously melted in your mouth and the fruit is so fresh I sincerely recommend this place"}
{"text":"We drove by and the name caught our eye, so we looked it up and to our delight found a unique and new desert go to spot! The service was great and the \"Patbingsu\" is AWESOME!!! 
The flavors are amazing and we'll be telling our our friends to check out Snowtime!"}
{"text":"Tried the Fruitylicious shaved ice, iced Matcha Latte, & the PB&J \"fish bun.\" Everything was amazing & it smells like heaven in there. I will definitely be back to get a custard- filled fish cone!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and I will definitely be going back! The people working were SO friendly and patient while I explored the menu! A cute little study spot or place to go with friends! Quality treats and quaint atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is my first experience trying this type of dessert and I was not disappointed.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The store is clean and bright.  The treats are yummy and there is a huge variety of options.  I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Cute shaved snow place that's been open for 3 weeks.  Very clean and the owners are super nice. The shaved snow is fluffy and light, and the toppings aren't overly sweet.  The medium size is great for sharing between 2-3 people.  Would come back!"}
{"text":"This place is DOPE  . Never tried something so unique and very innovative menu.

Ordered : 
Matcha Love - hands down the best dessert I have had in recent years. Small portion actually fills your stomach. Very great in taste.

This place is tiny, tidy and awesome. Great music.
Would totally visit every week from now..lol"}
{"text":"Excellent deserts. You can have them custom as well as custom drinks. High quality ingredients and nice environment. Great after dinner or after a massage next"}
{"text":"The double Oreo snow is so delicious! It came with condensed milk and I swapped the classic milk for coconut milk. Be sure to mix it all together. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"It's Snowtime, Synergy...because this place is a gem! You're welcome all 1980s cartoon fans out there that got that! Joking aside, Snowtime blew me away -- from their beyond friendly and personable service that instantly puts you in a good mood to their delicious and flavorful treats! And they do not skimp on toppings -- scoops of super soft mochi, mountains of matcha powder and heaps of fresh fruit adorn their cool, refreshing desserts. Plus, their teas are freshly brewed when you order and come out strong. Snowtime is truly, truly, outrageously great and has quickly become a favorite!"}
{"text":"Had a create your own, walked in clueless and just wanted something cold. Plain and simple it's a giant custom snowcone bowl. We had cheesecake, brownies and oreo. Not bad but wish it was a little creamier. Maybe next time we will try it with some fruits instead. Overall they were fast and the dish is still good. They do need to put a name or sign outside for people to see. It is also part of the revolving sushi place next door"}
{"text":"Wonderful treats and i love how warm and welcoming it is. We have been going for about every other week for the past 3 months and it is awesome to see them trying new things as well. I would highly recommend this place especially if you have kids its a great family environment"}
{"text":"Our first time here. I have had shaved ice some places before but this is very different. It's not too sweet and fruits are fresh. Would come here again to try new stuff."}
{"text":"It's perfect! Golden dust is just the right amount of sweet without being overwheming! The snow is perfect and it's so beautifully arranged! I jumped w joy when we walked past this, so glad they're here!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try the soft serve ice cream that comes in a fish bun. So when I found out this place had it I came specifically for this dessert. I ordered the matcha and taro mix with red bean topped with pocky sticks and a macaron. I really enjoyed the flavor combo and the presentation of the dessert was really cute. This dessert starts at 5.50 and 50 cents extra for any additional topping you choose. The macaron was also really good. It was soft with a nice crunch. Sometimes macarons can be to hard and it ruins the cookie. They also have other dessert like snow ( shaved ice) and drinks but I haven't had a chance to try it so once I do, I will update my review."}
{"text":"I actually like this. I was hesitant at first to try it since it sounded familiar snow ice, same concept as the other places. It actually isn't. Their \"snow\" is way better than the snow that others have tried. It's like ice almost but very refined. I ordered their matcha love or something along those lines was very light and amazing!!! They don't have boba as their toppings but that's okay you can always choose from their jellies, which isn't bad. This place is a good spot to study and I love how they place Christian music. It's something different for a change besides hip hop and r and b that every boba, snow place has. Try this new spot out!!!"}
{"text":"**Will give 3.5-4 stars**

Haven't been to a lot of places with bingsu in Az. 
This place is pretty decent. 

Food:
I tried the Matcha love.
Consist of: matcha dust, mochi, red bean, matcha snowball
Sweeter than what I prefer. 
But I do like the toppings and green tea ice cream, but I could definitely use more toppings. But it was a small size, so there's that. 

Price:
$5 + tax ish 

Environment: 
good hangout spot, windows with sun shining in. 
seating is limited if you have a big group, but small groups of 2-3 is fine. 

Service:
Fast if if it's not too busy, obviously 

Parking: big lot outside

Overall:
If you never had bingsu, come check it out.
If you don't like too sweet stuff, then maybe you won't like it as much."}
{"text":"Awesome. I'm glad this place is far from me. It's too good and eat it all the time. Fast, clean and super friendly!"}
{"text":"It's about time Arizona got a good bingsu place! The golden dust bingsu and fruit bingsu taste exactly like my childhood and I'm excited to try the other flavors too!! Excited for this place to be discovered as they just opened up a few days ago!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, definitely going to be coming more as the heat starts to kick up.  They have a good selection of different things to try as well."}
{"text":"Service was amazing. Walked in and was greeted with a smile. Got the taro fish cone. Also amazing. This place deserves the 5 stars it has."}
{"text":"This korean ice desert is definitely the best in town! The owner was super nice when we were there. Me and my friends ordered the Matcha and the Tiramisu! And it tasted soo good!!! Definitely gonna recommend this place and stop by again sometimes!"}
{"text":"It's officially Summer...if only in my head.
Temperature jump to 90+ makes me think and want snow. So why not Snowtime?! 

Was introduced to this great \"cold\" place by Miss Joyce and Miss Karen when we first met. Now it is a go-to destination;telling you how good, tasty, and refreshing Snowtime presents! Literally...COOL! 

Plenty of parking as it is part of a strip mall and the helpful staff is always at the ready!
Why not try? It'll do you good, especially in the AZ heat."}
{"text":"The taro green tea swirl soft serve is delicious!   The custard fish cakes are amazing too!"}
{"text":"After stalking this place on Instagram for weeks we finally had a chance to visit.  The shop was still pretty packed considering we went about an hour before closing. The menu was extensive but after lusting after the fish cone on the gram we decided to go for the intended goal. We tried the matcha taro swirl with cocoa dust and mochi after much debate. This ice cream was so delicious!!! It was creamy and flavorful without being too sweet. The combo of matcha and taro went great together. The fish cone was special, not only was it in the shape of a fish, the texture was chewy and the actual dough tastes pretty damn good. They even added custard surprise on the bottom of the cone, which was also very delicious. I can't wait to go back to try the snow!"}
{"text":"Will give 1 or 2 starts! 

I always come here to get the snow .  Normally I order matcha love and miss you matcha .  However, I always feel welcome when the owner was there and had a great experience .

Not this time , I came in around 8:30pm . I got the miss you matcha regular size with coconut milk(75 cent extra )  for the snow and no condensed milk. As the menu, the miss you matcha come with matcha tiramisu, matcha dust, pocky , strawberry  garnish. But it wasn't in my order when I got mine . All I had is ice now with 1 scoop of green tea ice cream and 4 matcha tiramisu. But the girls put the ice cream and the tiramisu in the middle of the snow with the rest of snow  on the top and cover it  , hang it to me . 

So what happen with the strawberry and the pocky??? I don't know if I wanna go back there anymore.  While I'm waiting for my order to be done , I saw the girl put the tiramisu in my cup with her hand without gloves! Uhmmm !  That not right. And I spend like 9$ for the ice snow and end up I threw it away because there nothing to enjoy except the ice cream and some tiramisu!"}
{"text":"Went here with the bestie for a tasty treat on a hot day. It definitely hit the spot. We both got the swirl soft serve of matcha and taro in the fish-shaped waffle cone. The soft serve was quite nice and not too sweet. I love that it came with two toppings and went with the sesame seeds and pocky. It also comes with a filling and I chose custard while my friend chose red beans. Unfortunately, the custard was really disappointing. I didn't even know it was in the cone. I couldn't see it or really taste it. I figured they forgot until my friend mentioned her red beans. I wish they would have added more custard. The most disappointing thing about this was that the waffle cone seemed like it had been sitting out awhile and I wish it was a little more flavorful. Ultimately, it was a good overall experience and worth the trip. I'd go again."}
{"text":"This place was soooo good! I got a matcha ice cream in a fish cone, which sounds weird but it's good lol it's just a warm cone shaped like a fish, and it has chocolate filling also. Definitely keep napkins near by because since it's warm it melts your ice cream quicker than normal. They have interesting flavors and awesome toppings, they also have dairy free options for anybody that is lactose intolerant. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Snowtime is possibly the best shaved ice shops I've been too! Their shaved ice is not too sweet and they're all unique and different! You can even create your own! The service is very friendly, while the atmosphere is opening and super clean! I will definite i love you be back when I have a shaved ice craving again! The Matcha Love was INCREDIBLE!"}
{"text":"This place is great to take your kids out and get dessert on a hot day in Arizona. Very friendly service. Lots of flavors to chose from."}
{"text":"Yum! Employee was super helpful about explaining what everything was and even pulled out an example tray. I had the miss you matcha special and really enjoyed it. Also, the to-go portions are big!"}
{"text":"My new favorite! Shared the medium Tira-miss-you and wanted more but had no room! If you haven't tried this place, it's a must! Friendly service and a clean place to hang out. Wanna try everything on the menu because they all sound so enticingly delicious! They're also served beautifully, that you just don't want to mess up the perfection but once you get in there it's over!"}
{"text":"Came to Tempe for a job training and decided to look up coffee shops around the area. Somehow I ended up coming across Snow Time! I've had shaved snow about a couple years ago but only in California, so I was really exited to find one here in Arizona. I got the Fruitilicious and I can not get over how amazing it was. The staff was amazing and were very helpful when I told them it was my first time at this location by bringing out an amazing display of samples! I got a \"small\" (which to me was not so small, which was perfect lol) for less than $5! I thought the price was GREAT for the size, quality and taste! I would so definitely come back again and recommend any of my friends that come to this area!"}
{"text":"Saw this well-reviewed snow place on Yelp and decided to get dessert after a filling lunch. Wow, it lived up to more than what I had thought it would be. 
How much better than snow get? Aren't they all the same? 
Well, give this place a try and you'll be so surprised! 
The shave snow is sooo light and fluffy, is that how Korean bingsu is suppose to be? Because I'm sold on it. 
We got red beans, mochi, and cheesecake and condensed milk as our toppings. 
Snowtime DOES NOT SKIMP ON TOPPINGS. Is that not enough for 5 stars? Nor try to charge extra for extra toppings. They had a little table set aside with condensed milk if you wanted more condense milk. 
The mochi were red bean mochi!! They had red beans in it, and were big pieces of red bean mochi cut into smaller pieces, not like the mochi you put on top of froyo. 
Service was great, the lady up front was very cheerful, and made for an even better experience. 
I will definitely visit Snowtime whenever I'm on that side of town!!!"}
{"text":"I visited Snowtime last year on a peaceful Sunday in late September. I ordered only the golden milk tea during my first visit. The owner politely encouraged me to try the patbingsu my next visit. I visited again in early October, by trying Golden Dust. Impressed, I decided I would try the Tira-Miss-You next. After arriving at a closed Lee's Sandwiches on Thanksgiving Day, I did my shopping at Lee Lee's, and decided to visit Snowtime. Because I forgot to specify my order to-go, the owner transferred my Tira-Miss-You to a carry-out container and added a little more topping, which I was just fine with. The Tira-Miss-You made my taste buds dance. Snowtime's selling of macarons also satiated my craving for macarons that brought me to Lee's to begin with. I visited on Christmas Eve after shopping at Lee Lee's again and decided to try Matcha Love. Matcha Love restored my taste buds' love for matcha. Bonus points for a polite owner, polite staff, great choice of music, and being open on holidays."}
{"text":"I am coming here regularly now. They finally have decaf and fancy coffee machine. Well the biggest change is they have fish bun ice cream. I love it. If u have not tried, get in the car now and drive to snowtime. Good job Snowtime."}
{"text":"Awesome stuff. The best Korean shaved milk around. I love the matcha and they have good sizes."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! The Espresso Snow is my favorite!! 

Great atmosphere, with a very welcoming team!"}
{"text":"I tried their matcha and taro swirl-soft serve fish cone and it was delicious. My fiancé ordered the chocolate and vanilla swirl and he enjoyed it was well. We both really liked the custard in the fish cone."}
{"text":"This place is super adorable and the people who work there are lovely. They're very friendly and kind  and are very open to answering your questions about their menu. I ordered a small Tira Miss U snow which was delicious and a coffee pudding for a total of around $7. The establishment is very clean and modern with cute little details everywhere 

UPDATE: I just wanted to attach some pictures of the mini green tea tiramisu I had today. $3.50"}
{"text":"Love it!! A place in Chandler that has taiyaki ice cream, what more could you ask for? Please add waffle (or pizookie ) cones to the menu!"}
{"text":"Today is my second visiting the snowtime! 
Very pleased with the bingo choices they offer! So far its the best one ive had in az! 

Their fruit one is very good cause its not the same fruit every time! 
Seasonal fruit:)"}
{"text":"Outstanding bing soo.  I no longer have to drive 7 hours to LA to get quality bing soo.  So happy this place opened up.  It is fantastic."}
{"text":"Experience: The space was quite spacious and fun! Family friendly, and I'd deff recommend taking everyone! 

Dessert:  OKAY, THE TARO AND MATCHA SOFT SERVE IS SOMETHING EVERY ICE CREAM LOVER NEEDS TO TRY!!! It was aesthetically placed on top a cake like \"fish shaped\" ice cream cone. 

I would definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"Love the frozen treats here! Definitely recommend for a summertime sweet treat on the wild side!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place out. Glad we did. We had their ice dessert with fruit. The fruit was very fresh. Service was great! Will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Great treats!! I loved the fish cone- the cone tastes like a crunchy pancake and the ice cream isn't overly sweet. The cone is coated with your choice of ganache- I chose Nutella. And then you get two add ons. A great treat for around $5!  So adorable and tasty. I need to come back and try the snows."}
{"text":"There's no time like Snowtime! What used to be a tattoo parlor is now a lovely Korean shaved ice (Bingsoo) shop. The menu has a varied selection whether you feel like something more chocolatey, fruity, or creamy.

My bingsoo buddy Joyce W. and I were curious about the \"golden dust\" so we asked what it was. The owner was very friendly and gracious enough to let us taste a little sample of it. Turns out it is sweet soy powder, and although it had that powdery drying effect on your tongue when eaten by itself, it was delightful when combined with the shaved ice and mochi in the Golden Dust bingsoo I had a bite of. That would make an interesting follow up to the cinnamon challenge by the way. Perhaps the next YouTube sensation will be the Golden Dust challenge!

I was in a fruity mood so I had a small sized custom creation which allows you to have 3 mix ins and your choice of drizzled sauce on top. I had the mochi, lychee and mango with chocolate sauce. It was made in the blink of an eye and we were in bingsoo bliss! The ice is more of the powdery type rather than the chunkier ice crystals they have at The Street which made for a delicate and light dessert. The mochi in the dessert was super soft and an interesting greenish color. Although I enjoyed the fresh fruit and chocolate I have to say I was more impressed with the Golden Dust preset combo so I might have to get one of those for myself next time!

Due to the sweet, friendly service and delicious snow, I'll be back for sure for some more refreshing Korean-style shaved ice.

4.5/5"}
{"text":"I walked up and down the plaza strip and ended up accepting my denial and accepted I was lost. I instantly called Snowtime to help me with directions and the lady on the phone was so sweet! 

I walked in and I was greeted instantly by an older lady and the younger one who took my phone call. We both shared a laugh as she asked if I was the lady who just called. She was extremely patient with me and asked if this was my first time so she can explain what the snow products were on the menu. 

After what felt like 10 minutes of staring at the menu over what I wanted to get, (they all sounded amazing..) I decided on a regular Fruitilicious and waited only a few minutes before they came out to me with what looked like a heaven in a to-go cup! The snow even stays cold for a long time and doesn't melt. Every bite was bold, flavorful, not overly sweet, and just so delicious. My seasonal fruits where mango, kiwi, and frozen watermelon cubes. Each bite felt delicious and different, unlike normal desserts of like.. say ice cream where it's just one flavor. 

The ladies checked up on me to see if I enjoyed it and heck yeah I did! Definitely coming back here. It's quiet enough to be a place of study too. Very clean and peaceful! 

My sister and her bf enjoyed this place so much and I gave it a shot. Ended up tipping 15% so my total was $5.59! Not bad at all for lovely service and  great yummy dessert!"}
{"text":"This place is the cutest! everything was yummy and reasonably priced. The women owner was very kind and asked us if it was our first time. Since it was she carefully explained the menu to us. I would definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"We are huge fans of bingsoo and this is our new favorite! The simple one with fruit is great and the coffee one they have is awesome too!!! Can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for an Asian snow place in metro Phoenix, not as good as the big cities offerings but I was satisfied. I have been here twice and got the Matcha Love both times, being a lover of all things matcha. A small portion is definitely enough for a dessert, a medium or large must be meal sized.

The red beans could have been cooked a little longer my last time but I take this as a good sign because it means they make their own instead of using canned. 

The little conveyer belt sushi cafe just opened up next door and there is a pass through from Snowtime. Gotta try that out next time!"}
{"text":"I usually come here to get their Nutella fishes or their fish cones. Warm crunchiness on the outside and a swift filling on the inside. This cafe is Korean family owned and everyone is extremely cute and nice! What's nice about this spot is that there's Gogi next door and there's also a conveyor belt sushi place next-door. After eating some yummy bulgogi bibimbap (my favorite) or eating sushi next door, you can grab some delicious dessert. 

Also, summertime is coming up, this place is somewhere nice to sit down and chill to eat a cold
dessert."}
{"text":"Came solely for the fish cones; matcha soft serve with taro powder, pocky, and custard filling. Soooo so good!!! And sooo messy haha. Fish shaped is not the best shape to hold ice cream. Pro tip for mommies; bring wet naps and do not take into the car. Regardless I definitely recommend coming here and definitely plan on coming back myself."}
{"text":"I'm glad that there are more asian desserts and restaurants opening in the Phoenix area..this place is clean and nice staff.. the only suggestion I can give this place is that they should layer some of the toppings with the shaved ice.. they have all the toppings top and some layering the bottom of the bowl (ie powdered chocolate/condensed milk) but nothing in the middle.."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place. When my boyfriend and I went we got the fruit bowl with mango, pineapples & strawberries. Very yummy. The owner was so kind to us & made the place 10x better with her customer service. I can't wait to come back & try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great first time experience at Snowtime! It's an awesome change at the taste of just regular ice cream, the \"snow\" at the bottom evens out the sweetness from everything else on top of it. Along with that we ordered the Fish Waffle things, and those were really good also, my personal favorite was the Nutella but Mac & cheese may be next to taste for me  I had no complaints about this place as it is very clean and everything came out just the way we ordered, what more should I expect?"}
{"text":"Walked past and almost missed it -'never had Korean ice cream before and was a great first experience Had the Tira- Miss - you snow which was delicious - light not too sweet and super yummy!! They had both dairy and non dairy options and lots of toppings - And the staff were super friendly and attentive too - Will definitely come back to try other flavors!! Great addition to the strip mall!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place! I've had bing soo in many places in California and none of them compare to Snowtime. Not only are the owners and staff super sweet (they even remembered my name) but they give out huge portions with quality ingredients! The small is perfect for one person and regular is great for 2-3 people. So far, I've tried the Matcha, the Double Oreo, and the Fruitilicious. The fruitilicious is my favorite because it comes with a variety/ plenty of fruit (strawberry, mango, and watermelon) which makes me feel slightly healthier lol. All of them come with a scoop of ice cream and condensed milk or chocolate syrup. The double Oreo also comes with a ghiradelli square so it's fancy af. 

My friend tried the tira- miss you and loved it as well! It came with a little slice of tiramisu cake and strawberry. I can't wait to try out all the different flavors. 

The service and quality deserves 10/5 stars  You will likely see me there all the time considering how hot AZ is and how much I love this place!"}
{"text":"soooo delicious!!!!! customer service is awesome too. the two ladies working were so nice and helpful! definitely will be back soon."}
{"text":"4.5
I came here last weekend with my daughter. We rode our bikes and Snowtime's treats hit the spot. I had the vanilla soft serve in their taiyaki (fish shaped bun) with matcha powder and red bean filling. Very good. We also had a mango kiwi tea with mango jellies, also very refreshing. The shop was busy but staff was never overwhelmed. Highly recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Not a fan of milk flavored ice with toppings. The staff is very friendly which is why I gave them 3 Stars, but the food and drink offerings just don't stand up to par with what you're paying. I would like more flavor options and customization seeing that they're competing with Glacier Snow and Boba Tea House. I'd give them a try again because I wouldn't want to see them close so soon, but I hope they step it up a notch."}
{"text":"I'm so excited that my hometown now has a snow place! My mom, sister, and me ordered the following: Double Oreo, Fruitilicous, and one of their specials that was called Miss You Matcha. We each got a small size and I paid around $17. My sister thoroughly enjoyed her Oreo and this was her first time eating snow. I really liked my Fruitilicous. It's a great refreshing dessert. The Miss You Matcha had snow, green tea ice cream, and matcha tiramisu pieces and was garnished with 1 strawberry. Overall, we enjoyed our dessert!"}
{"text":"They have the best dessert. The workers are very friendly. I would recommend everyone to try out their dessert!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Good prices and many choices for toppings, etc, it's too bad that every time I come here there's barely anyone! I hope this place gets more business."}
{"text":"Best dessert I've ever had. My boyfriend and I couldn't stop talking about it after we left. The fish cones are so chewy and delicious. We had the taro ice cream and it was perfect. Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"We were finally south of the city enough to swing by and check this place out on a Sunday around 1pm. Several tables were taken but it wasn't too packed. It's a cute little shop where you can get coffee, tea, or ice cream/snow. 

First we ordered the vanilla soft serve in the super cute fish cones with sprinkles. A super cute treat that will definitely please the instagram crowd. The ice cream was good and the cone was more cakey than a hard traditional cone. Still tasty. 

Next was a small size of the double Oreo snow.  Basically a bowl of snow with Oreo dust and chocolate drizzle, there is also a vanilla \"snowball\" on top which tastes more like standard ice cream. The snow tastes more icy but still has some light creamy flavor. I've never had it before but it was pretty good! I will say that two of us who usually can finish our own ice cream no problem couldn't finish the snow. 

You order at the front counter and pick up your treat when it's done. Staff working was friendly. The dining area was clean and cute, the bathroom was clean as well. 

Cute spot to pick up a treat and escape the heat.

Update: returned again to try the taro soft serve in a fish cone. I got Oreo dust as my topping. It was delicious.  Definitely more of a soft serve person so I would come back for this instead of snow. Again, the snow here is good but I am just personally not the biggest fan. Either way, the return trip really made it a 5 for me. Don't forget you can get two toppings and a filling for your cone. Great service and cool place."}
{"text":"Stopped to grab a quick refreshing snack today.  It's located on the quiet side of the strip mall. Met with a welcoming greeting and an explanation of the menu. Got the Miss You Matcha snow special. It was light & delicious and the small was the perfect size for one person. Also got the golden milk tea it was tasty without being too sweet. The place was immaculately clean and roomy with lots of seating & good music. I'd stop here again to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"We have been here twice. The first time it was so good we had to go again. The second time was even better. Try the snow. Create your own it taste so amazing. First time my son got the fish cone with pocky's. Second time I got the orange tropical spritzer is was so yummy! Along with a large snow. (Classic milk, Oreos, strawberries, bananas, with condensed milk). Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"This is such a cute and modern place! I ordered vanilla ice cream in the fish cone, with coconut shavings and a macaroon. It was delicious! I would definitely reccomended the place for a quick dessert. Friendly customer service too."}
{"text":"Their shaved ice is very good! They also added a soft serve fish bun to their menu and it's delicious! I got the fish bun with matches ice cream, custard filling, and strawberries and golden dust on top. It melts very quickly and gets kind of messy but overall it was amazing and it looks super cute!"}
{"text":"Seriously love this place! They also can sub the milk with almond milk which is amazing!"}
{"text":"I tried the small Golden Dust. It tasted amazing. The red bean and rice cake was a good combination. I am not sure what the golden dust was, my guess is peanut powder or almond powder."}
{"text":"For sure a good dessert spot around town with some competition across the street.  The staff is great and being my first time here, they were very helpful and helped make my decision what to get very easy.

I had the tiramisu and is was extremely good and tasted just like it would in a cake version.

The only down side was the fruit ice bowl they have( I cant remember the name of the exact dish) the fruit was almost frozen and unable to eat, the ice shaving I think reflected on this."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time tonight.  Ice orders were good.  Tasted great.  Service was a bit slow.  The place felt understaffed for the night."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place for dessert! Their portions are HUGE and the price is very reasonable. The dessert itself is delicious and not overly sweet like some shaved ice places. The flavors are awesome and the owner was so nice! I will definitely be coming back to escape the AZ heat!"}
{"text":"Came here for my first time recently. INCREDIBLE customer service!! They are all so nice and seem very happy doing what they do. The shop is very cute and clean and they're desserts are delicious. I definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I can see why Snowtime has 5 stars. We came in at an odd time so we were the only ones in there. We wanted to try everything but decided on gold dust shaved ice, sweet potato latte, Thai ice tea and Korean gold fish snacks. 

Thai ice tea was as expected, but sweet potato latte was little more interesting. You can really smell and taste the sweet potato (not yam with orange flesh, but the Japanese/korean sweet potato with golden flesh). Having said that not much of the coffee flavor came through, but I really enjoyed this drink. Perfect sweetness and smoothness. 

Golden dust was really good too. There were nice soft mochi with red beans smothered in condensed milk over shaved ice. Not too sweet but very refreshing and satisfying.

The sweet gold fishes were highlight of them all. You can choose either red bean or Nutella filling. We tried both and enjoyed both very much. They make these on the spot when you place the order so they come out piping hot. I also noticed the dough gets more chewier as it cools. I would be back just to get more of these. They were $.99 each or $2.50 for three. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Forget about Netflix and chill.  I wanna bingsu and chill!

Yay!  Dessert!  First of all, the older lady up front was the sweetest lady ever.  She was kind, friendly, and even let us try the \"Golden Dust.\" Golden Dust is a yellow bean powder and is a very popular topping in Korean bingsu.  It was unexpectedly sweet like a tickle fight with your grandma!

I ended up getting a small #1 Golden Dust. I wasn't sure what to expect.  Will it be creamy silky snow like the place across the street?  Was it going to be an icy bingsu like the one by Mesa Community College?  It was neither!  Upon sticking my spoon in, I discovered that it was powdery like freshly fallen snow. I was so fascinated by the texture.  I didn't realize I only had one piece of rice cake in my snow mixture and gave it to Karen W. but she was sweet enough to give me a mochi back after I realized my error.  I'm a derp.  This is why it's good to surround yourself with nice people, y'all!  That rice cake was insanely smooth and we later found out that they bought it at a store. Snowtime also has cafe drinks which ate white delicious as well.

All in all, it's a brightly lit space that sits next to Gelato 64 where the tattoo shop use to be.  There's a larger private room you can sit a larger party at.  The older lady is very much knowledgeable with Yelp so you know they care about their customers.  I will definitely come back to try more bingsum 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place after I had dinner at Gogi right next door. I was first attracted to the ambiance. It was cute, clean, and had a simple yet enticing menu. I got the matcha snow which included mochi and red bean. The snow was light...maybe a little too light which they layered matcha powder, red bean, and mochi. The mochi was a weird texture. Overall, the flavors were good. I'm intrigued by some of the the other flavors so I'll be sure to go back and try them. This place would be awesome in the summer - light cool and refreshing!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, great atmosphere, and yummy desserts!! A good place to chill after lunch/dinner, or just to meet up with someone or study! I'll definitely be back:)"}
{"text":"Very busy walking in on a Sunday afternoon, their identity is the fish shaped cone and the small fish shaped filled treat.

The soft serve ice cream is good, but not setting off anything new and different.

The house made fish cone was fresh but I expected it to be more crispy.

We had the chocolate soft serve ice cream and decided to go with the cream instead of the nutella.

Just felt their gimmick was the fish shaped cone, the amount of soft serve ice cream that they give you is generous but it is not like a home made unique ice cream.

All the different things they do are nice but combined it is just an average tasting ice cream in a fish shaped cone that is average."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to enjoy desserts and spend some quality time with your friends after a meal, this is the place to be. Their shave ice is my favorite and I believe they purchased the machine from Korea. If you want to know what snow should really taste like, this is the place to be. Items are a bit more on the pricy side, but you definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The service is on point and the snow is sooo yummy!m, but my favorite are the cheese fish pastries. It's not actual fish it's like a little sweet roll shaped like a fish with stuff inside! They are so good!"}
