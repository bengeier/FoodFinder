{"text":"Horrible service & I got a bad batch of yogurt, So i called the manager and told her and she told me it was my fault cause I didn't test the yogurt out before I bought it.... I always get the same thing so I didn't feel the need to test it out..... so I wasted 6 bucks on a cup of crappy spoiled yogurt...."}
{"text":"I just moved to Charlotte from NYC and was so pumped to find a self-serve frozen yogurt place that is comparable to what I find in NYC!  They have about 12 or so flavors including white chocolate, cheesecake, mango and my favorite cookies and cream.  They have a variety of toppings including mochi that I am always craving whenever I get frozen yogurt!  It's reasonably priced.  I can get my fill and split with a friend for less than $3.00.  It's never full there, so I love that I don't have to wait in line!"}
{"text":"This place is so good, they have a great selection of flavors and they are cheaper than the TCBY upstairs.  Their fruit toppings are always fresh (I've been here twice) and the candy selection is awesome.  What really won  me over was their sweet and condesed milk syrup they have it's so delicious and unique.  Place is neat and clean and the staff is friendly.  Go here!!"}
{"text":"Five stars for yogurt actually taste like yogurt, NOT ice cream. Five stars for having amazing flavors such as taro, mango, strawberry... Yes, Taro!!! I haven't found another place that has taro flavor fro yo."}
