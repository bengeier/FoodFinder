{"text":"Dont really understand the negative review, first of all, you waited 40 min outside the shop when it was clear that no one was there?  And second, I frequent this place alot and was not aware the one guy that works/owns the place even wore a \"uniform\".  I loved this place, it was a great sandwich, great prices and the owner was always pleasant and friendly.  Chuppas?  Really?  Yeah, a great market, but their sandwiches are not even close to Sandwich Nation quality and size.  I dont know what happened that day, or if it even happened, but this place was worth a try."}
{"text":"Yummmm, always fresh, always tasty. One of the best sub places in Cleveland. I haven't been able to justify Subway anymore when I can go to Sandwich Nation and get a MUCH MUCH better sub. Would highly recommend this place. The Big Nation is killer!"}
{"text":"Below is an email just sent to the food writer for the Sun Newspapers.    Hello,  Today occurred an object lesson in how local businesses lose customers.  Based on your review (and, by the way, in NO way am I remotely thinking you're responsible for this), decided to go to Sandwich Nation. I made the mistake of getting there at 11:30. Your article does state they open at noon, but the last thing I looked at was their Facebook entry (see below) and I remembered only 11 am.  No big deal. I waited around and by 12:10 there was still NO ONE in the shop. And I can prove it because their uniform company guy was waiting along with me.  As I was leaving he was calling his boss to determine if he should stay longer or leave.  How in goodness sake on the SAME day a newspaper article comes out about your business are you not there NOT only on time, but at least early enough to do the prep work necessary to serve customers at noon? Had they come at 12:10 how long would it have been before they did all the necessary steps to even get ready to serve customers?   I absolutely 100% do not understand that mentality. If there was some sort of emergency, sure, it's understandable. But having heard they've shown up late before, well, I doubt that was the situation.  So, now here's what happens 1) I was looking for an excellent sandwich place on that part of town. Regardless of how good their food is they have lost me forever as a customer. I would sooner eat fast food (and I hate fast food) then give my money to people who quite obviously do not take their work seriously. 2) I am going to post this letter on Yelp. Right now there are no reviews on Sandwich Nation. As this will be the first, any guesses how many it will discourage from going there?  Oh, by the way, I drove a couple miles down Pearl to Chuppa's, a locally owned business that completely understands how to treat their customers.  Best regards,"}
