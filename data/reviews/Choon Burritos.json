{"text":"Excellent food for such a small place.  Fresh tortillas made here daily.  Outstanding"}
{"text":"Muy buena toda  la comida de todos los guisos tienen excelente sabor. Solo la muchacha que toma las órdenes y cobra en la caja la mayor parte del tiempo está ella y siempre de muy mala actitud. 
 Excellent food all around the menu just the cashier it's almost the same girl and always on bad mood but don't mind her and enjoy"}
{"text":"Horrible experience my boyfriend brought the burrito home for me, it was good the following week i actually went in to buy burritos but the cashier with blonde dyed hair was so rude and the guy with long curly hair made our burritos without gloves and instead of putting the burritos on the aluminum first he put it straight on the counter first thats horrible. Bad service all around dont recommend it at all!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best hidden burrito spot in the valley.  So damn good. Don't expect your typical *insert name*Beto carne sada joint. This is the real deal. Like mama used to make them... back in my little pubelito of Santa Ana, California. lol jk :) 

But for reals.  These burritos are bomb!"}
{"text":"Everything is so good. They just need a little bit of help. Girls are distracted messing up the orders!"}
{"text":"Are u kidding me? No fresh food at all no cilantro no pico nothing green!! tasted effing foul and i really did try.. i swear i was even not rude i shudda threw this slop right back at them! We actually say something is CHOON if its terrible now at our house! The first place we went to eat at our new neighborhood.. I'm so glad other places were way better.. CHHOOOOONN!! FFAAIILL!!"}
{"text":"Awesome home made flour tortillas!!  Great price for good size burritos. Burritos are delish! :-)"}
{"text":"The food was ok. The tortillas where amazing definitely authentic. But i tried the desebrada verde and discada burrito and meat wasn't the best i've tried. My parents make some of the best from that kind desebrada and discadas so i know how it should taste like. I think its a little over priced as well since they changed their prices. Ill go back to try something different. Something to try if you want something authentic."}
{"text":"No matter how \"good\" those tortillas are, the kitchen looks so dirty. I cant even. Tried it once and got sick for days man."}
{"text":"Recommended to me by a Mexican client. Tortillas made on site, nopales available, and lengua is their top seller. About as authentic as it gets. Owner is from Ciudad Juarez and food reflects that region. I enjoyed a divide rent style of Mexican and will be returning!"}
{"text":"So I came to the new location on Thomas just to give it a try mainly because the thought of homemade tortillas sounded very enticing.  The outside and inside of the establishment was very cheesy. The inside was clean but that should always be the standard. I checked out the menu and decided on the classic carne asada burrito.  ( customer service was nowhere near good the lady just had a \"blahh\" attitude)  when I got my burrito (7.25) it looked nothing like a burrito it looked like a gyro.  The \"tortilla\"  was more like a gyro dough then a actual \"tortilla\".  As soon as I picked up my burrito it started falling apart because the \"tortilla\" is so thick they don't roll it tight it's just who Loosely rolled like a crepe. The meat was also cut as if it was going on a gyro, the meat had no flavor all I could taste was the gyro like \"tortilla\". The burrito comes with meat and beans but you get like 2 % beans 30% meat and 68% tortilla. Overall if this place was a gyro restaurant it would be okay at best but to pass as mexican food no not for me! I would suggest sticking to filibertos!"}
{"text":"One of my current favorite places. Dont be scared of the neighborhood, never had issues. And the druve is definately worth it. We have tried discada, picadillo, barbacoa, winnies(dint get it it really isnt good) and my favorite addiction: lengua en salsa verde(beef tongue in green salsa). Its pretty spicy but so good and the tongue is always perfectly cooked. I love their red salsa, its super spicy but amazingly good. They have a little salsa bar with red and green salsa, lemons, roasted serranos and those yellow chilis, and fresh raw green serranos. Prices are fair avg $4. The lengua is $6.75 but totally worth it(and if you last checked lengua aint cheap at the supermarket). The tortillas are freshly made and they add beans and choice of meat. Barbacoa is the only one they put cilantro and onion if you like. Weekends they have barbacoa tacos and combination plates(not sure why only weekends) this is when their barbacoa seems to be fresher and better. Give this place a try its totally worth it and try the barbacoa or lengua, safest choices if you are unsure."}
{"text":"They have about 21 different kinds of burritos here, to include breakfast ones. It is a small and simple place, but the burritos are delicious. Best of all, the tortillas are hand made and fresh. If your looking for a quick snack but something different than the usual \"Bertos\" place around Phoenix, I recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"A little pricey but great, authentic burritos! Our favorite is barbacoa, definitely worth checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food and quick service! What more can you ask for? We are regulars and tell everyone about this place. Love them!"}
{"text":"Meh! I tried 4 burritos. Picadillo, it was dry as dry can be over cooked meet with no flavor barely any potatoes. What saved this burrito? The green salsa!
2nd burrito was Discada, meh! Spicy which have it some what of a flavor but not discada flavor. Nothing saved this burrito, it went straight to the trash.
3rd burrito was Chicharrón, flavor was great, however the  quality of the chicharron was terrible inedible...big hard chunks or super chewy pieces. I took most of the chicharron out and ate the rest. What saved this burrito? The sauce.
4th burrito was the Chile Relleno, I figured keep my fav last since, come on you can't really fuck up a chille relleno burrito, but I guess I was wrong, the Chile relleno was tiny, full of seed and again super bland. 

Conclusion, all 4 burritos were bland, their spices are lacking attention and the beans don't taste like anything either. I would only go back for the tortillas. Shame I was looking forward to some authentic burritos."}
{"text":"40th street and Thomas location the worst place ever! Giant sign on the building says they are open till 10 pm and they were closed at 7:50. Plus the people that work there are RUDE!"}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing. It there service has gone down and they are always out of stuff by 4pm, which is sad because their tortillas are good. This place still has potential to turn it around. Service fee if you use a card


Update: thought I give it another try. It's still not great, the chile relleno burrito was okay but I had to laugh at the size of the chile, it was tiny so for 7 bucks I got a bean and cheese burrito lol for that size they should use 2 chile rellenos so I'm not eating mostly tortilla"}
{"text":"My go to Mexican burrito spot! Quick and perfect for a fast lunch! About $4-$8 a burrito depending on what you choose. Also have breakfast burritos. The tortillas taste home and hand made fresh!"}
{"text":"This is a small place so during the busy hours it's hard to find a seat. But the burritos are bomb. If you're looking for a quick burrito that'll fill you and taste good this is the place."}
{"text":"I tried choon burrito for the first time today. I saw a post on the Chile relleno burrito that said it almost had nothing in it and I felt a little discouraged but since I had been wanting to try it I went and I was not disappointed at all! I love their burrito and I will be in for more!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for about 2 years, at the beginning customer service was great but this last 6 months it has been the opposite BAD service.  I wish the owner could see this. BAD."}
{"text":"Very authentic delicious Mexican food, flour tortillas from scratch always extra points and the staff was polite and friendly even encouraged me to order in even though they were 10 mins from closing! I opted to take out still the shredded beef with green sauce was delicious I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good asado burrito and the homemade tortillas. I will definitely pay another visit soon."}
{"text":"Muy ricos burritos. La limpieza del lugar está excelente y me encanta el concepto original. Tortillas recién hechas súper rico"}
{"text":"They had me at fresh \"handmade\"flour tortillas... Sad to say that you rarely find it in the valley...corn yes, flour no...Glad I won't be having to go to Texas for some authentic Juarez burritos... 

I had the lengua burrito:it's on the spicy side but it's so good 

Hubby had Picadillo 

Daughter had the chorizo and egg 

All amazing!
Huge portions at great prices. 
Can't wait to go back and try something different"}
{"text":"I used to like this place and recommend it to my friends but not anymore they changed there service for the worse. I would understand if your business was at the Biltmore or Arcadia or Scottsdale even I would understand but the area they are located at is the worst...Sorry Choon you just lost a customer and I won't be referring my friends anymore"}
{"text":"This place is really good because they're different. They aren't your typical carnitas/asada burritos. They stay true to their roots as in their name \"the original burrito\". They have handmade flour tortillas and homestyle cooking from Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua. They also have gorditas and barbacoa tacos but only until 2pm daily. They have lonches de barbacoa but only Saturday and Sunday and if you aren't there early you might not make it in time because it gets BUSY. With all that being said, the actual cooking is delicious but most of it is SPICY! The deshebrada verde and bisteck ranchero are definitely favorites and if you can't do spicy, barbacoa tacos with the handmade corn tortillas are it. Overall it's a nice place, don't go in expecting your mainstream  burrito because that isn't what these guys are about. Keep an open mind and try something different!"}
{"text":"I love the tortillas! Made fresh. Sometime they run out now and you see a little lady rolling out tortillas and cook them on the stove. We typically have been n cheese burrito. The steak Ranchero is also good, probably one of my favorite. The family likes tongue and things like that, but I'm not going there!
All of their liquados are yummy. 
My only complaint, and it is not really a complaint, but I wish there were more vegetarian/vegan options...but it is what it is."}
{"text":"There were several different meats to choose from. The cashier let me taste a few which was awesome. But.....there is absolutely nothing more here than 6 or 7 burritos. I ordered the beef and potatoes, great flavor but no lettuce, pico, sour cream, guac. Nothing. Just meat and tortilla. No chips and salsa, no taco option....literally, just burritos. Good luck with that."}
