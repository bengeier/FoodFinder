{"text":"Took us in 20 minutes prior to close after lunch buffet.  Freshly made food not warmed up.  We're told the buffet rotates menu with the different chefs.  Excellent quality and variety."}
{"text":"One of the finest chicken Biriyanis I have tasted. I happened to taste bullet naan which was unique to this restaurant and felt it was awesome"}
{"text":"After a long time I visited a Indian Restaurant in the area and my experience is quite bad here at Godavari. To start with service is pathetic and they told me that there was wait for 20 minutes and we almost waited double the time they promised. There is no waiting space in the restaurant and may be very inconvenient for families with little kids. After finding a seat they were asking us to adjust in 4 seats as we were five. There was almost 20 minute wait for fresh batch of Indian Bread (Naan). Vegetarian items quality is not great. Paneer was rubbery. Sauce used in Paneer curry was sweet not to the taste buds. The Buffet didn't had good variety of vegetarian options. I wouldn't suggest vegetarians to go here for buffet. The price is on quite higher side for what they offer. Overall our experience is very bad."}
{"text":"i have been here about a dozen times now, each time tried something different. 

The food is always great, probably the best Indian food i have had in the Charlotte area. Try the Dosa (an indian pancake), they are exceptional. The naan are also good and its nice to see goat as an option.

Their food is on the spicy side, so if you are unsure i would suggest mild. Its normally a warning sign to me to have the question of spice level, another reason to pick mild. IMO a particular dish generally has a particular spice level, but in this case its OK because the underlying food is good.

A few common curry dishes you may expect from any Indian restaurant are not here but the curries the do have are good."}
{"text":"Had heard reviews from friends and this place is worth a try. Their Mysore Bonda was good and I hadn't seen it on the menu in any other indian restaurant. Chicken curry dish (kodi koora) was tasty too. Value for money."}
{"text":"Worst experience after ordering food on Sunday night. Order chicken biryani mild and they added extra red chilly powder just to show how much they understand. I had to throw away all. Ordered idly sambhar and they gave 2 spoon filled sambhar bowl( same as chutney bowl). Ordered noodles and they were completely tasteless. I am never going there again. And for the brave-hearts who still wanna go, make sure you check the take away food else you are in for huge surprise."}
{"text":"Since its raining I was looking to eat somewhere close by & hopefully different. Oh man did the place hit the spot!! It was so good & fresh! Will go there again without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Saturday lunch buffet.  Great variety of fresh dishes.  Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Very Good Thali.  Very Tasty vegetarian Thaali.
Will come back on next visit.

{"text":"Pathetic service .. only one person availble during lunch whi serves as well as bills. He forgets who came with you and wants everyone to present for billing. Buffet full of empty trays. Would never visit again."}
{"text":"Why do I do this to myself.  I really want the food to be good.  So I gave Godavari one more try and guess what - big disappointment. I ordered 4 Naan and received 1.  Sorry guests no Naan for you. They must have a different chef as the food taste and quality has gone down the tube.  I have ordered Paneer Tikka Masala for the last year plus from here and never was there green peppers and onions in it - it was a flavorful sauce loaded with paneer.  Now if it tasted good then I say keep them however the green peppers and onions dominated the dish.  In my to go order I had about 10 pieces of paneer(I actually counted them) and the rest of it were inedible onions and green peppers. Then I ordered non spicy egg fried rice and chicken fried rice for my kids and it was so spicy they couldn't eat it.  Sorry kids no dinner for you.  Spend $80 and get food I literally threw in the garbage.  Personally I would have rather burned my money then pay for this horrible food plus the embarrassment as I had guests over and they had no Naan and their kids had no food to eat.  I really would like a refund, however you know how that goes sorry but we don't do that.  Would be great if the owner would reach out and offer that.  I would love this to be one of my regular places to eat however time and time again it is just getting worse. It is either the slowest service you have ever seen or poorly prepared food or both."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Korma. Both were delicious!  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday for lunch buffet. Quality of the food was good. The chicken kabab was actually fresh and not stale like most Indian buffets.
The spread was good. Will go again!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum we had the indochinese... Manchow soup and gobi manchurian.... Finger licking good. The kids ordered naan. Paneer Tika masala, palak paneer ... They loved it which is high praise coming from the kids. Hubby ordered lamb kebab and he absolutely loved it.  
Hope the restaurant stays the same and we will be back on one of our next trips into Charlotte."}
{"text":"Wrost food.they don't even know how to make Indian food. We did a to go order for paneer tikka masala and tandoori roti with butter and what we got is totally different . When we opened the food at home it was a disaster. 

The worst part is when we called them all they had is sorry.
Such a disappointment and shame how these people are looting in the name of authentic Indian food.

We will never go there !"}
{"text":"Was visiting Charlotte and wanted to check out Indian food scene. I was pleasantly surprised. The food was excellent. Service quick and pleasant. Will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"The best Indian food in Charlotte by far. And wonderful gracious service by Tony. My third time here and still loving it"}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars. We waited on a veg biriyani and mango lassi for more than an hour and still it wasn't ready! We could just get our starters punugulu, Which turned out to be something like Mysore bonda . We ordered paneer tikka; they messed up our order and gave the right one after an hour. The place wasn't even crowded so that we could think they were flooded with orders.Very sad experience !"}
{"text":"I came today with my husband and son. We loved this place. Food was very very delicious n it was of rich taste. We would surely come back and this place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place was pretty mediocre.  I came for the lunch buffet on a Saturday.  The pakoras and bean/eggplant curry were salty, but did not have much other flavor to speak of.  They did not make any naan until I had practically finished my meal.  Fruit flies were swarming the fruit bowl.  There were quite a few South Asian patrons in the joint, probably due to the relative lack of options in the area.  I will not be making a repeat trip."}
{"text":"This was very delicious Indian food. It's a much welcomed addition to the Ballantyne area. I'm glad I live around the corner, and will be sure to dine here again.  My only complaint about the restaurant would be the execution of the service.  There seemed to be some confusion between the back and the front of the restaurant when it came to ordering food. However, this is a brand new restaurant that's only been open a week. I expect these problems will be eventually ironed out. However with that said, I thought the food was very good, and will definitely cause me to overlook any hiccups in their service.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. I have tried almost all vegetarian dishes here and this place never lets me down. Food tastes always fresh and consistently good.

But but but...Biggest turn down is the service. This place looks understaff and you've to ask for service again and again. If they can improve their service they'll be the best in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant.delicious food and so many varieties. Non veg and veg buffets options are superb"}
{"text":"1. Food - Below average. We went for Sunday buffet and menu was very much limited. They took a long time to refill items.
Taste was below average. Mutton was undercooked.
2. Ambience - Very bad. Aircon was not working and was suffocating.
3. Service - There was only one person who cleaned the tables and for billing. We were served water when we were about to leave.
4. Cost - overpriced.15 dollar for Sunday buffet.not worth.

Overall bad experience, will not return."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Friday and shocked to find out that most of items were not fresh. Might be leftovers from previous day's. No refills on buffet tables unless you ask. Pathetic, sloppy, leftover food and service. This used to a good one atleast couple of months back. Asked the waiter about food condition but answer was expected that everything was fresh and made on same day. And gave an explanation about food saying previous chef left. But I am 100% sure that FOOD SERVED WAS NOT FRESH BUT LEFTOVERS FROM PREVIOUS DAYS."}
{"text":"Awesome Egg Biriyani! We go to this place atleast once a week. Once I ordered to-go at 9 and collected at 10PM, even after hours they were kind enough to keep this place open. Very good service. If you are in balantyne area, you gotta check out this place."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing unlimited dosa night.. Really enjoyed along with dosa they have veggie buffet which includes shiro, khir, puri, medu vada, fried chana and idli.."}
{"text":"The food  is very good. After long time  we enjoyed the authentic  taste of South indian  food."}
{"text":"This place turned out to be a pure disappointment!! Delayed service for 45 minutes despite only 2 customers in the whole restaurant and poor food quality. Chicken 65 was reheated premade stale fried chicken with indochinese sauce applied externally- no freshness and no marination. Mango lassi was mango pulp diluted with water. Had to wait 40 minutes for Chicken biryani which turned out to be a microwave reheated biryani with cold chicken which we sent back for reheating which didn't work. Service waiter was aware of the situation but couldn't help much. Will probably not go again."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and the service is good. We really liked the food.

If you want awesome Indian food. This is the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place was sheer disappointment. After watching a movie, we were in a mood to have some Indian tea and snacks and decided to try the closest place. We ordered for some chai ( tea) and coffees. We got coffee on time but tea took almost 45 minutes and it was just milk with no flavor of tea. Also ordered for idlis and dosas and it took forever to come and to top it all the order did not come to the table at one go. It took him 10 minutes before every dish even though we all ordered for same snacks. I am sure there are better Indian restaurants around."}
{"text":"Visited on Tuesday when they have Unlimited Dosa Night with buffet. Very good food options, really nice taste and fast service."}
{"text":"Came for the buffet during the week. Amazing find. Naan bread is so luscious and fluffy. Chicken tikka masala out of this world. Generous amount of chicken in buffet unlike others. They have a lot of other options as well like lamb. Rice was good as well. They also had masala chai. Staff was super nice and helpful with questions. Will come here more. $8 tues- thurs. closed Monday's. Weekends larger buffet :)"}
{"text":"Not sure if the main chef is out on vacation but last night's take away wasn't up to scratch. To be fair I've only ever ordered Poori 2x before both from here. Last nights was our third try and it lacked the same consistency and flavor than the others and was more like a soup. It also lacked a substantial amount of potatoes but I may know where those went. I also ordered a chicken vindaloo which was a bit light on chicken but heavy on the potatoes (ah - found them!). While I do love potatoes in my curries I do also love the protein! Lastly, there was no rice!

Hopefully just a misstep for the evening as my previous meals there were fairly good."}
{"text":"Had to wait 60 minutes to receive a chicken dum biryani. The taste is just average. Also the chicken 65 was not good. I wouldn't visit again."}
{"text":"Worst service.. It takes time to place order; there was only one waiter initially and then the second comes in after 10 minutes.. We said the second waiter we are ready place an order he said, the other waiter will take you order.. They took our order after 20 minutes after a couple of attempts asking him to take our order.. 

Food was not Good. Ordered arrived in another 10 minutes. 

To pay the bill we had to wait for another 15 min.. We didn't get the check to our table so I went to the front desk to pay.. The waiter/ receptionist ignored a couple of times.. I was running out time and patience so I asked to him front the desk, do you want me to pay or leave? He didn't apologize just asked which table.. Paid and felt.."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and fresh, love the menu choices, always friendly service. Best Indian food we've had in a loooong time!"}
{"text":"Four stars for the food and minus one star for the customer service. I have been here for lunch with my colleagues and all they serve for lunch is the thali; vegetarian or non-vegetarian. I've had both and their preparation is good. Ample amount of vegetable and meat servings for the price you would pay. The place is clean. Now what I don't like is the customer service. On a couple of occasions, food came out on our plate right from the fridge. Just plain cold! Some of the items were heated for maybe like 30 seconds, so it was mildly warm."}
{"text":"Appetizers were good, dinner was average.  Asked for mild because of kids and got spicy instead.  Ridiculous wait time for service and food."}
{"text":"I'm from Nj and had many I mean many Indian restaurants and after moving here have been disappointed in most until I ate here. I don't judge a place by eating there once. I had food here 4 times so far and have been impressed with food each time. Last time I was there was the only time I dined in and food was amazing. Only thing I would suggest to opener is to have more then one waiter. Except for that I give them 5 stars for food."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I've had in North Carolina.  Have only been for the lunch buffet but it was excellent.  It's refreshing to find a place that offers options with more spice than you'd usually get without a special request.  The vegetable biryani was my favorite!  The chicken tikka masala was mild enough for the kids and also very good.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"great food, eehhh service, but who cares, i'll put up with it for the food.  as good as any place in town but cheaper and you'll see where the savings come from, ambiance is a 3.  did i say great food?"}
{"text":"I've tried this place several times (dine-in and take-out) and the quality of the food is always good. The problem has always been the service. For dine-in, it is relatively slow and only one person working on busy Friday or Saturday evenings. Last week I ordered take-out and paid online for the discount. I waited over 30 min past the requested time for pick-up I selected at check-out to be told they didn't have my dish. None of the Tikka Masala dishes were available the Friday evening. The 10% just didn't seem worth the trouble and I plan to call in to make sure they have the ingredients for my food before I pay and wait for nothing."}
{"text":"I would have loved to have tried this place out but will never get that chance, after walking out three times due to poor sanitary scores. The 90.5 on my last attempt was the HIGHest of my visits; the other two attempts were in the 80s. I can understand and accept one bad score but to be consistently low is a sign of real problems. I know some don't really care about such things and will scoff at my emphasis on such things, but there are just too many other better options in south Charlotte that carry much lower risks of contracting salmonella."}
{"text":"This is probably my worst restaurant experience in Charlotte. We came here to try out their well advertised dosa buffet on Tuesday's. First of all, the person who took our order completely ignored us but I don't blame him - the place is totally understaffed. 

The buffet had cold items, no sambar was available and the dosas weren't even tasty ( too oily).

Very disappointed!!! Charlotte definitely has much better Indian restaurant options."}
{"text":"As a white man new to Indian food I really enjoyed the quality and authenticity of the cuisine. It was a bit pricey compared to other Indian restaurants I've been too but I'm certain some of the ingredients, i.e. chicken, was of better quality. My brother and I ate here on a Sunday and it was low key and enjoyable.  

Sure service should be better, but I'm not too demanding from that perspective. I come for the food and considering its down the road from me I'll make the slight sacrifice."}
{"text":"As usual Today's thali was good except Rotis were crispy n hard. Other than that everything was perfect..I love this place"}
{"text":"The taste was excellent however it was a little spicier than I expected. Not the fault of the restaurant as I ordered low spice and have a delicate palette. Service was excellent, atmosphere comfortable. Be sure to try the garlic naan."}
{"text":"What a welcome addition to Ballantyne! 
Food tastes like how indian food in a restaurant should. Already eaten here half a dozen times. Food tastes very similar to how it tastes in indian restaurants back in bangalore. 
I am vegetarian and the paneer butter masala is just really good. Breads are very good too and so is the mirchi bajji. 

About to go there again tonight!"}
{"text":"Not sure what's up with the 4 stars for this place. I ordered dosa and idli today and I am just disappointed with the amount of sambhar that came with this. By no means the sambhar will suffice for even one idli let alone the other two.

Godavari, if you are aiming to maintain the clientele in the current pricing, pay close attention to the amount of accompniments with entrees. I am never returning to this business"}
{"text":"We dined there the first week open and thought the food ranged from very good to good. The Chef was kind enough to come to our table to describe the special. I will go into detail on the plates after another visit or so but it may take some convincing to get my spouse back any time soon...

The reason for 3 instead of 4 stars: Last week my wife stopped by after a long day of work for \"walk-in and order take out\" and had an unreasonable wait of one hour - she went shopping for 20 minutes, returned and then went home before returning. The person taking order on the tablet seemed unfamiliar with the system which may have contributed but not the only reason. Wife was offered 10% discount but she had already paid and did not want additional delay.

She observed all tables being waited on by the same overworked person that handled us on first visit and we had the impression she had no wait staff experience at all but I hope she succeeds. 

I do want chime in to say that there needs to be better coordination between the front and the kitchen.

I have a feeling there is some great food here already, deserving better service, and hope the best for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really mediocre food, inattentive; bordering on rude service and no ambiance. This place was recommended to me by a woman waiting for a table at another restaurant. We were discussing good Indian and she claimed that Godavari is the best in Charlotte. We went as they opened for dinner service and although there was no-one else in the restaurant, our server ignore our empty water glasses. The  meal was bland and all the vegetables were clearly frozen mixed veggies. We asked for a medium spice level and got mild, at best. Many better places in town, not worth going here."}
{"text":"I went for a buffet on Friday!! It wasn't good, no one to serve water. I thought it was a godhavari chain , but it's not.  Not worthy!! Only thing I liked is sweets !!"}
{"text":"Went for a Saturday buffet expecting a good spread of options. Had one waiter who also doubled up as the cashier.. limited options with some stuff not available for the buffet for good 10-15 minutes after  which it was refilled. Tandoori did not look or taste fresh.Not worth the money as there are plenty of other Indian buffet options for nearby with a better selection of menu options nearby."}
{"text":"We went for the buffet on Sunday, and were very disappointed. Taste of the food was average, and choice of dishes was very limited."}
{"text":"First time getting food to go from this Indian restaurant. The Naan, both Garlic and Chili was very good. Their Cilantro Chutney was so delicious I almost did a \"Shot\" of it!  The Tandoori Chicken was very well seasoned and had a great spice to it. The Indian Cauliflower which was fried and in a nice spicy sauce was also very good. The Dal Mahkani was not the best, it was not too thick and not very spicy. The only thing truly negative was the fact that it took quite a while to get the food. I would come back and try it again and eat in the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Since it's a new restaurant so food quality and taste was good.They have lot of veg options and different variety of food.
Weekend buffet was good.
When compare to value for the money all items are little bit pricey."}
{"text":"Very bad food. 
We came for the Tuesday buffet and the food was literally Inedible. All of the deep fried food were so greasy than usual. Not to mention the dosas that were bad and had a strong sour taste. 


Service was horrible. Wouldn't advice if you are looking for a good Indian food"}
{"text":"I was disappointed. My entree was unremarkable and dessert was inedible. Service was poor. I asked for recommendations and the waiter couldn't answer. No one brought me a check. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant 5 stars because the food is very very good.  The reason I won't do that is because I ordered boneless chicken biriyani and I got chicken dum biriyani instead, which I don't like as much.  I paid extra for the boneless and didn't get what I paid for.

Otherwise, the food is very good and authentic South Indian cuisine, which I prefer over North Indian food."}
{"text":"So, we were starving and still decided to try a new place out instead of our usual Indian hangouts.... I'm going to do a course by course live review...

Ordered sweet corn soup after we were told that they ran out of manchow (Sat night, 7.45pm).

When the order arrived 15 min later, I was in for a surprise. For the 1st time in my life, I saw sweet corn soup that was yellow in color. The taste was horrible. Seemed like mashed vegetables and hot water. Not a good start. Never ordering that again (that is if I come back here)... 

Next comes the Vada and Chilly Chicken. The Vada is nothing to write home about. Ordinary. The chutneys were bad. Sambhar was watery.

Chilly Chicken is decent. Though the server tried to convince us that it was goat. It isn't. But Blue Taj still has the best Chilly Chicken or Prawn in the area. 

It's 8.40. Still waiting for the entrees to arrive... oh wait, I think they're here... 

Okay. The chicken curry, which was their specialty (some organic chicken stuff), was a disappointment. The chicken had no moisture and felt like chewing fibers. The gravy was okay. Felt like a bit too much red pepper was thrown in... 

Goat pepper fry was plain bad. No juice in the meat. There was no taste. No flavor. I am a huge goat connoisseur and I am hurt... 

Naan. Half cooked. Need I say more. 

I regret my decision, specifically today. We could have had a sumptuous dinner at any of regular spots. 

9pm. $69 after taxes and tip. Oh well.... we'll fry some samosas tonight while binge watching Netflix. Ciao!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great addition to the area.  This place is newer, and I hope they stick around!  I really like Indian food, and have been to many places, including all of them in South Charlotte and I think this one is the best.

Service was impeccable.  Constant attention, everything was prompt and well presented.  We were there around 6 PM on a Tuesday and dining traffic was light.  There were a steady stream of takeout customers coming through though, and the place was busy.

The food was the highlight though.  We had three adults and three kids.  We had biryani, vindaloo, butter chicken, a lentil entree and naan.  Everything was flavorful and cooked perfectly.  They made the biryani mild for the kids.  They brought some chutneys and raitha too which added additional flavor.

Portions were ample, we had some food to take home.  

The only thing I can say negative is that the vindaloo should have been hotter.  I have only ever had it one way, super hot.  And it just wasn't here.

Looking forward to returning again soon."}
{"text":"While most of the attention in the area is focused on Stonecrest, or perhaps Blakeney, or Ballantyne, this little shopping center is tucked on the backside (heh - I said \"backside\") and gets an insane amount of traffic. Don't believe me? Try turning from Williams Pond onto Elm, even if you want to go right. Left? Don't even think about it.

Regardless, inside this center is a fascinating little Indian restaurant that is simply amazing. As with many such places, you may have to wait a bit - but the wait is completely worth it, as the flavors are quite tasty. Not being in the back while they were making the food, I can't say, but it seems as if the ingredients are very fresh.

Instead of a simple sauce on the Tikka Masala, it has a variety of herbs mixed in. Or perhaps they cleaned things out and put whatever is left into the sauce. Whatever the case, it was tasty and it seemed to be rather good. The same is true of their naan - something you may typically overlook, but don't diss the naan, as it can make the meal.

Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Yes, was in the mood for Indian food and this restaurant did not disappoint. I liked the variety offered in the buffett, was pleased with lunch and originality of the food. I will come back."}
{"text":"We ordered take out online which worked really well though honestly the website is not secure for Credit cards but I figure every hacker has all of my info from Equifax anyway so I went with it. We order four entrees and a dosa and it was enough food for 2 people for dinner and lunch the next day. Loved the butter chicken especially. Chicken may have been a little dry. The tandori chicken was a ton of chicken and really delicious. Loved the dosa as well. We had a ton of food and ate too much. That's my own fault."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian we us d to like the authenticity of this Indian restaurant. It started out as a small restaurant and the food was freshly prepared everyday. 
Over the fast few months , this restaurant totally lost the quality and is very bad. Very spicy , no flavor and lots of oily greasy foods. 
The chefs are not the same anymore and something changed with the management , and it's lost its name.
Save you money , time and health by not going there."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last evening, food was horrible. Idly was like a stone, dosa was bad and the masala was burned, all chutneys were bad and no salt in most dishes . Would  not recommend this place to anyone, we are definitely not going back"}
{"text":"I'd love to review the food, but I have been sitting here for 57 minutes (yes, exactly) and have yet to receive my meal. I have also received no apology for the wait. 

This is my second visit here and it will be my last. The first one was not that good so I'm not sure what possessed me to come back. Maybe because it is Christmas Eve and there are not many places open. My bad. We actually know of an Indian restaurant where the service is great and the food is better, but my family was hungry and it is further from home. What a mistake!

I wish I could give this place zero stars. Not happy.

40 minutes later - finally got the food (but still no apology) and brought it home. Surprise, surprise...it was good. Too bad my family had filled up on snacks during the LONG wait and were not really hungry."}
{"text":"We've had takeout biryani from Godavari many times, but we've only started dining in recently since the quality of our usual Indian place has gone downhill. We went for Sunday buffet and were pleasantly surprised. Food was fresh and good with a good mix of meat, veggies, fish. All of the chutneys were fresh and tasty. The owner came by and asked for feedback on the food. Seems like a very nice guy. We enjoyed the buffet so much that we brought both sets of parents there for Mother's Day brunch. They even had Mother's Day cake for dessert and made dosas to order. 

Good service and fresh food!"}
{"text":"The food is very yummy here. Non veg curry was awesomely spicy. All the veg and non-veg items were very freshly made and good in taste. I went there during weekend for lunch (buffet). I felt that  it was little bit crowded during that time. The food is really nice that I will definitely visit for sure at next time."}
{"text":"Visited Godavari Indian Cuisine second times. Food was very fresh and tasty. Both veg and non-veg items are good. A must try place for it's delicious food.the reason for drop on two stars .....the chicken come  uncooked today"}
{"text":"I came here with my colleagues, Best food I ever had after long time.
and I have been to this place couple of times for lunch with my friends, I have been to lot of  Indian restaurants in Charlotte and must say that the food here is one of the best Indian food that one can get in NC

I would suggest you guys  should try everything here especially veg and non veg platters 


Good service ,
Good food."}
