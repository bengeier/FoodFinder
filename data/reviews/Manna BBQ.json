{"text":"I was there on week day it was very good and good meat good service almost good as the one in Los Angeles. But I wish they have kids price because my 10 year old daughter don't eat that much they charge adult price. Over all it's good but if you have kids it's very hard to go. I don't think we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"This all you can eat BBQ is the the best one we have been to in Arizona. Good food and very cute waiters!"}
{"text":"This Korean BBW is very good. And the service is best in Arizona. The price is very nice."}
{"text":"AWESOME KOREAN BBQ!! Scarlett hooked us up and was super friendly. Good food and good service. 2nd time here and we'll be back again!!"}
{"text":"We went to Manna to celebrate my friend getting out of classes. We were amazingly impressed by Manna's selection, meat quality, side options and price. Alex, our server was super nice and attentive! The staff seemed to be having fun and enjoying their jobs. Honestly, out of all the KBBQ places we have been to in Phoenix and Las Vegas, Manna is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Gen was my favorite ayce korean bbq until I discovered this new place. Their food portion is twice to three times bigger than gen. Their side dishes taste a lot better than gen. Service was great, always check on us not the server but the owner as well. The price is 3 dollar more than gen but I personally think it all worths it. My husband is a very big meat eater and we only orders 3 times with 4-5 different dishes each time, we are all stuffed and satisfied. The tofu soup is delicious with veggie and seafood as well. There is no waiting even we go at 7pm on Saturday. And also there is no limit number of meat that you can order a time as well. Definitely will come back for more!!! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great service, there is good food and a really nice ambience. Been coming here whenever we are craving Korean bbq."}
{"text":"Our favorite is Beef Qalbi and spicy chicken.  We have visited almost all Korean BBQ please and this is our best impressions in quantity, flavor, and service; jolly, excellent friendly service. Helen was a great host."}
{"text":"Bomb ayce kbbq. Scarlett the host was very accommodating with our party. Alex was also amazing!!"}
{"text":"Manna is the real deal and on par with its San Diego location. The quality of meat is great and Alex was a great server. Happy that all these KBBQ joints are finally popping up in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! Scarlett was our hostess and treated us so well. The quality of meat was great and reminded me of the LA Korean AYCE places. I would definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"I've been to many Korean barbecues (Yakinikus) so I have some experience in rating these types of restaurants. Three things I like to rate restaurants on are service and hospitality, quality of food, and pricing. Before I start my review, I'd like to inform you that this is an \"all you can eat\" yakiniku. You have two hours to eat whatever you order on their menu, so pace yourself and don't over order! You will be charged for leftovers! 

First off, hospitality and service. Despite being absolutely busy the night I went, the waiters/waitresses were always prompt on tending to my requests. They have a button on the side of the table which calls a waiter or waitress over, and the response time was never more than a minute. The waiters and waitresses (Yakinikus don't function like traditional restaurants, you will be seeing more than one waiter/waitress while dining) were always courteous and addressed all my needs quickly. Excellent customer service and hospitality.

Second point. Food. The food was great. The restaurant is located right next to an Asian market, which is where I imagine they source all their meats and spices. Everything seemed authentic and tasted delicious. The bulgogi and kalbi were well marinated, I'd highly recommend you order these two items (they're a staple in Korean cuisine). The sides are also delicious and free, so don't hesitate to order more sides! Food was definitely a five out of five.

Now, for pricing. As you can expect out of an all you can eat restaurant, you pay a one time fee. I am quite embarrassed to say I don't remember how much I paid for my dinner (I had 6 family members that night), but I believe it came out to about $22 per person for dinner pricing, which is pretty damn good! Just make sure you eat three orders worth of meat per person if you want to get value out of your meal (that is if you don't mind looking like a glutton). 

Overall, would highly recommend this restaurant! Good food, good pricing, and great service!"}
{"text":"Great food, good ambience! Definitely worth coming back to. I suggest trying the jumuluk and the beef tongue. Service is excellent too, staff were very helpful, each table also has its own call light.
Biloooo"}
{"text":"Love this place! Beef belly is my fav! You might want to wear pants with an elastic waistband. You'll thank me later ;)"}
{"text":"This was absolutely awesome! We came for a family dinner and had so much fun cooking together! The food was great quality and great flavor with so many choices for us to pick from. I would highly recommend them for anyone who is looking for a fun yummy night out!"}
{"text":"Very good AYCE place. We like Prime Ribeye, Bulgogi, Beef Tongue, Beef Belly, Beef Brisket are all good. 
I knocked off 1 star because the service could be more attentive and generous so it will go well with the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Good service, good food thats the power of mannas


The food is really good and the service is awesome. Honeslty i reconmend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"If I can rate this place zero stars I would! Worse service ever. Our server didn't bother writing our order down and told us directly saying one person to order! It wouldn't have been difficult if he had written it down in the first place. The manager came by to check on us, seconds later our server comes by saying that his manager was complaining that we had to many sides on our table?!? How rude!!! What kind of management is this? After we were done with our meal the server comes by and tells us you told me you were gonna finish the sides and you didn't!!!  I am so speechless! Save your money y'all! Don't come to this place!!"}
{"text":"Soooo good! Food was great and omg the price! Awesome! Sharon was our waitress and she was as so incredible, funny, sweet, attentive and knowledgeable. The macaroons are to DIE for, get all of them!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazingly good kids under 5 eat free! I definitely will have to skip a meal for two days tho before going because you will get full fast!! The customer service there is phenomenal ! One thing I would recommend is employees not talking about quitting while out in the dining room in front of guests :/ they have ice cream sandwich macaroons for 4$ if interested &' for 21.99 you can eat until you drop which I  was excited about if I was extremely hungry I'd definitely go back !"}
{"text":"The food is soo sooo delicious!! 
The service is also so great. Our waitress was so nice and attentive! 
Everything is so authentic here. The taste, the atmosphere... I highly recommend stoping here"}
{"text":"Honestly, I would come here just for the sides! Like with all KBBQ spots, the sides are unlimited, but compared to other KBBQ popping out all over the valley, in my opinion this place has the best sides. Our server Alex was attentive and friendly. Customer service here is on point. Plus side is no waiting over 2 hours to get a table. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Real deal Holyfield, this place is awesome!  After experiencing AYCE at this place, it's going to be truly hard to go back to other places.  I love Korean BBQ, one of the biggest drawbacks is generally it's pretty expensive.  My wife and I would go and easily drop 100.00 if not more, and we don't even drink.  So I like places like Hoodori, ChoDang, Sizzle, and Ohya but I always spend a lot at those places and sometimes walk away not full.  Well after experiencing Manna BBQ I found it a much better experience and as far as the quality, it was right up there with those places.  For 28.99 a person, it's a heck of a deal.  So we ventured here on a Tuesday night, they were pretty busy and after reading the reviews, they get pretty packed on the weekends as well.  I came here with my wife and my brother and his girl.  We ordered variety of different meats, soups, and sides.  Everything was right on and delicious.  We ordered tons of food and the wait staff was extremely nice and helpful.

Overall, one heck of a dining experience.  I think this was one of the better meals I've had in a long time.  I am very impressed and would highly recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"Manna BBQ is exceptional! Everything from the service to the quality is much better than other all you can eat BBQ places in the Mesa/Tempe area. Our waiters Tristan and Sharon were amazing as well, they were always helping us when we needed something and they were quick! My friends and I will be back again."}
{"text":"Manna BBQ is the best Korean bbq in AZ. You don't need to read anymore, just go eat here. 

Alright, if you're still reading, Manna's got the best quality meat--you can see how marbled the meat is in their cuts, and you can definitely taste the flavor. If they only had beef belly and brisket I'd be completely fine--that's how good it is. Their sides are better than the other places, not only in taste but also selection--they have fried egg! 

The restaurant is a little small, and they're usually pretty busy, but if you've got a group of 6 or more you can call ahead and make a reservation! Otherwise you'll just be waiting for your name to be called. 

The service is solid here--they let you choose 3 meats at a time, and they're pretty lenient if you wanna choose 1 or 2 more. 

You can't go wrong with Manna."}
{"text":"In one word: delicious! 

We were here for Christmas lunch and it did not disappoint! AYCE Korean bbq and fresh kimchi, amongst the ten or so other side dishes. Chatted with the owner and learned that he started manna bbq in San Diego and has several restaurants in California, Arizona, and soon Texas. Suffice it to say, his restaurants are a success for a reason! Stop by if you're craving good quality Korean bbq!"}
{"text":"Manna BBQ is defiantly a place I would recommend. The meat was great. I loved they had adjustable vent hoods that they had at every table. I left not smelling of meat and full."}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ food AND service I've ever had in both the Phoenix area and Chicago and I've had my fair share!  Went for my birthday and loved it."}
{"text":"Manna is awesome experience!!! Our server ALEX is the BEST!!! He was very accommodating!!! I recommend this place to everyone who loves to eat fresh food!!! :D"}
{"text":"We tried several different Korean BBQ places here in town and I have to say that Manna is our current favorite! We came here when it was open for about a month. It wasn't very crowded or busy because of their competition with Gen Korean BBQ; however, we personally think that Manna wins this competition! Service was exceptional. I preferred their variety of side dishes compared to other Korean BBQ restaurants. And their quality of meat was top notch!"}
{"text":"Manna BBQ is the best in the state when it comes to KBBQ. Manna BBQ served high quality meat with good marbling that was packed full of flavor. The restaurant was a little small so it was full rather quickly. However, the staff does a good job turning the tables so the wait isnt nearly as bad as the other Korean BBQ restaurants in the state. 
Highly recommend paying for the A1 menu so you can order the Deungshim and Goutsal along with the bulgogi and galbi. Delicious!
The service was friendly, informative, and prompt. Overall, we would definitely return to Manna BBQ. We look forward to trying more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"4-stars for Manna and 2-stars for Gen indicates that Manna is twice as good as Gen, which sounds about right to me.  

There is no need to go with the more expensive premium menu - the regular menu at $22 is good enough.

Kids under 10 eat for $11.

Ranking of meat taste/quality from best to worst: 
1.  beef belly - more tender than the brisket
2.  chadol baegi
3.  galbi - waaay better than Gen's galbi
4.  bulgogi
5.  jumooluk
6.  beef rib meat
7.  spicy pork belly
8.  octopus - wasn't marinated in gochujang or anything
9.  intestine - it is what it is, it's just something to chew on

Vegetables make for good grilling companions, the soybean paste stew tastes way better than the soondubu, banchan is tasty, and the steamed egg is passable.  They offer two types of salads, and I liked the onion-cilantro one better than the lettuce one, but both were good.  Hite was ice-cold.  No dduk wrap here.

We were allowed 3 plates per order, but the food came out fast and more orders were put in really quickly, and the portion sizes were actually quite large.  Service was fast, efficient, and friendly.  The grill vents that descend from the ceiling kept the smoke after-smell to a minimum, and the ambiance was family-friendly and comfortable.  Meat quality is expected for AYCE, but the food here at Manna is of considerably higher quality than Gen's.   Factor in the lower prices at Manna, and it's easy to see that Gen comes in a distant 2nd in the race to claim the title of Phoenix's best Korean AYCE BBQ restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday night with a party of 5. It wasn't packed but we still had to wait. Got in there and ordered the premium menu. Ok $28 not so bad. The ribeye was light tough. The bulgogi was good. Short rib sliced steak and brisket was the best. Service was ok. 

The bad part of the meal was the hood had to be lowered almost 5\" above the grill to suck up all the smoke. The knob to adjust the flame was by my crotch where I was sitting, so it felt like the waitress was reaching to grab my crotch throughout the night.!? She would say excuse me or anything just reached in there. My wife got made and had to sit closer to me and told the waitress to back off!!

But the real kicker was $2.50 for a can of no name iced tea and no refills!!!!"}
{"text":"Ever since Gens Korean BBQ came out there have been uproar of other Korean BBQ places here in AZ. However this Korean BBQ place is one of my least places to go to because the service was not good and the meat was okay. The waitress barely came around at the table when we needed more meat and more side dishes. She also kept adjusting our heat to cook the meat which was very annoying. The meat was very chewy and not very good.

I do not recommend coming here if you want to try Korean BBQ for the first time."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The portions are HUGE... larger than I've ever seen in a Korean BBQ Restaurant. Every cut of meat is perfectly trimmed as well, with the perfect proportion of meat to fat for high flavor. The staff here is absolutely amazing as well! Our server was Sharon and she was the bomb.com - so welcoming and fun. She definitely made our experience world class.

Bonus: THEY HAVE MACARON ICE CREAM SANDWICHES. It's like I've died and went to heaven."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Lovely little place.

Everyone enjoyed and had a great time with the food, which was brought out hastily.

Our only \"beef\" was that all he employees kept adjusting our grill level as if we didn't know how to cook. They kept turning it down and we'd readjust it right away. Nothing was even burning and they'd still adjust it. Was annoying but at the same time we rolled with it. Every time an employee would walk by we would put our hand over the adjusting knob. Lol."}
{"text":"Lately when I crave AYCE meat, this is the place I end up at. The quality of the meat is awesome and the marinade is amazing! I usually go for the 21.99 and to be honest I don't even know what is in the pricier one because I don't feel like I'm missing anything. 

My only complaint is sometimes you get too much meat. I am a type of person who loves to taste a bit of everything so I don't want to get full after a few orders of meat. But since I've been here a few times, I just know to kindly remind the server I only want little portions of whatever I wanted to try. 

I love, love, love the LA galbi, the beef brisket, and beef belly. Their pork belly is also delicious with the right amount of fat and meat. And recently I got to try the spicy pork galbi which I like as well. 

Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Compared to Gen:

The wait is much shorter
the meat quality is definitely better
the service is much quicker
the banchan is more extensive
their tofu soup is much tastier. 

Their A1 premium menu is $3 more than the dinner price at Gen but it is definitely worth it. The experience is top notch and meals are always consistent.

Props to Alex for being a great waiter."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ place in the valley. Food is fresh and have many options. Customer service is very nice. They always check on our table to make sure we have everything we need.  I never have to wait so long to get a table here compare to other k-bbq places"}
{"text":"Been here three times, the first time, no complaints, it was pretty good. However, the second and third time I was disappointed. On both occasions a hair was found in our meat. The first on the raw pork jaw that had just come out of the kitchen and the second time I didn't even notice until I had dipped the meat in the sauce and saw it had been cooked into the meat. From where I sat in the back near the kitchen, the kitchen workers did not wear any form of restraint to pull back their hair. Also, it took them up to 6 calls of the bell to finally get a server, mind you, it wasn't very busy at all, to come change our grill and tell them there was a hair in our meat. Coming from someone who also works at a korean bbq restaurant that has the bell system, I found that to be very unacceptable. Although the quality of meat is slightly better than Gen in Tempe, the service itself was lacking. Good tasting food isn't the only thing that makes a restaurant good, what makes it good is that the staff is able to communicate between themselves and the customers to ensure an overall pleasant experience."}
{"text":"In my opinion, I think Manna BBQ is better than Gen Korean BBQ because there's no waiting and the portion each time they bring you are much more than what Gen offers."}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ in AZ! All you can eat with two options: premium or regular. The price difference is, in my personal opinion, insignificant. As such, I'd recommend getting the premium if you wanna try the good meat. My favorite is the cow tongue so I always get the premium when I visit. 

The servers will not cook for you here unless you ask. If you're not sure how to do it, I would ask for assistance or bring someone who has experience! 

The service is overall decent but manna needs to be clearer with their rules and stick with it. Last time I went with a group of 12+ they told us they gave away our spot because we were late. I asked if there was a grace period and they mentioned 10 minutes. Checked the time and we had two minutes before the grace period was up. So we ended up waiting another good 15 min which isn't too bad. Parking is a bit of pain as it's next to the Asiana market."}
{"text":"First time eating at a Korean BBQ, and I don't think I want to go anywhere else. My roommate took me here with him. For $30 you get all you can eat meat. The beef tongue was better than I thought (never had tongue of any kind) and the brisket was amazing. I don't know what the two sauces were but one was sweet and the other salty, both added so much flavor to the food. This place knows their meats.

I got to practice my Korean a little too so I can't wait to practice more. The service was fun and very attentive. Will definitely come here whenever I can.

{"text":"First time at Manna. Meat was marinated well and delicious. The best KBBQ in the area. Scarlet our hostess was awesome."}
{"text":"Out of all the AYCE BBQ joints that have popped up, this place is the best! The meats are fresh and service is awesome (shout-out to Alex)!"}
{"text":"I brought my baby, husband and his friends here, we loved it. The service was excellent, we came for dinner at the start of a rush but they were able to answer our call right away. We got the bulgogi, kalbi, and brisket and all were delicious. The cooking surface is far enough away from the edges that young kids shouldn't be able to reach it and every table has a vent so you don't get smoked out. The place looked very clean, the tables didn't feel sticky at all and the cooking areas seemed very clean. We are definitely going to come back"}
{"text":"This place was the first korean bar-b-que I have ever been to. AWESOME.
Just let them know if your new to this they will assist.
Food was so dang good I loved it. Oh yeah!"}
{"text":"Oh so happy that I decided to check this place out! We are obsessed with Korean bbq and so glad that there are a few options to pick from in the valley. 

We arrived on Saturday around 1pm and the place was starting to get busy. We were a party of 7 so they had to do some arranging before we could sit down. We waited about 10 minutes and finally the hostess came around and took us to the back. 

We were seated, taken our drink orders, and were brought out a salad right away. Sodas come in cans and each soda is $1.99. Oh and no refills. We all decided to go the A2 option ($21.99) instead of the premium option. ($28.99)

The meats we had were that of:
Spicy pork belly: spicy but delicious! Great taste
Spicy chicken: the chicken was very chewy and was our least favorite 
Bulgogi: very good!
LA Galbi: delicious cuts of meat! The marinade was great!
Beef brisket: waitresses recommendation and didn't disappoint!  
Steamed egg: too watered down and had no flavor, boo :(

Meats were brought out in doubles so each side of our table always had meat which was so convenient. The waitress was very attentive and always made sure our drinks were filled. 

We were stuffed at the end and we were there about an hour and a half. There is a two hour time limit but that's more then enough time to finish. 

Our total came out to be $175 for a party of 7. 

I will definitely be back as everything was good."}
{"text":"Good stuff and lots of good quality meat. Get ready to cook it yourself! My arm is sore from all the cooking."}
{"text":"One of the best Korean BBQ meals I've had.

I've eaten Korean BBQ in LA and San Diego. I'd say this place is better than the Manna in San Diego and equally as good as BBQ in LA.

Side dishes are all very good, with the kimchi and potato being the highlights. 

Beef bulgogi and galbi were wonderfully marinated. Chadol was a pleasant surprise. It was very thinly sliced and delicious when dipped in the dark sauce. 

Steamed egg was also light and fluffy.

Service was much more attentive than other places I've been. Each employee checked on us as they passed by, to refill drinks and change the grill. Service was not pushy, even though they were busy. 

This is a total gem in Phoenix. I won't have to drive to San Diego or LA for good Korean BBQ anymore."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The prices are pretty reasonable about $29 per person for all you can eat. You have the chance to try as many different meats if you like.You can order 4 different meats at a time and it all comes with several side dishes.    We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We just had a horrible meal at this place, usually we came  twice a week that I think we do consider as old faces. Last time we came over total three of us, and one of my friend ate already, asked if she can just have the veg salad that is on side served before dish came. Also we told them twice she is not going to refill. The portion of the salad probably only contain the edges of the leaves and countable. So the manger told us the side was free and yes she can eat the salad only and charge for two person. So this time here we are again, but one of our friend don't feel like eating bbq today so we ask if we are allowed to do what we did last time cause we thought it was still important to clarify with them  that the previous time when we were here we've been told that the salad on side was free, so I can eat that only.  This time the different female manger told us that if I'm a vegetarian that I have to pay half of the price for the veg menu. She continuously trying to convince us that is a vegetarian price, but the original point was asking if she can only eat the salad but nothing else with no refill. We've been told different charge functions of this restaurant, and it is a shame that the female manger doesn't know how to communicate with us, and only concentrate on how to make money instead of having human connection towards to customers. Just a heads up for who will be having mana that make sure to clearly your check before you pay for what you didn't had."}
{"text":"Our first time here and it is wonderful!  The food is delicious- get the premium!  As a meat lover of the highest order I felt like I was in heaven.  And our server Cameron was fantastic; always at our side with the next serving.  We WILL be back."}
{"text":"Korean BBQ is one of my favorite meals, especially on days when I'm feelin' extra gluttonous. Walking out of your car to the front door of the restaurant, the heavenly smell of KBBQ gets stronger and stronger, beckoning you inside. It's basically like a siren's song. But instead of crashing your ship on rocks, you get to eat your weight in meat! 

Having been to Manna in San Diego and really loving it, I wasn't quite sure what to expect walking in here. We opted for the pricier set ($28/person), because we figured we might as well go big on a Tuesday night. As mentioned in other reviews, the portion sizes are very generous--we were at one point just brought an entire rib eye steak. And it was delicious. Overall, I thought the quality of the meat was really good. However, the marinated ones were just a tad too salty for my taste, though the flavoring was excellent. That being said, I still powered through all of the Galbi and also the second order of it we got, because, well, it's Galbi. 

We also got the steamed egg, which was fine but not quite as smooth as it should've been. The tofu stew was also quite salty, and seemed more like a sauce than a stew/soup. Another thing to note was that there were not many sauce options--and I'm a girl who really loves her dipping sauces. There was salt and pepper, or what I believe was their house sauce, that just tasted like sweet and slightly vinegary soy sauce. The sauce/sides options were a little bit disappointing for sure. 

You can't really expect to walk out of any KBBQ place not smelling 100% like meat smoke (no major complaints here, personally), but I feel like this was particularly pungent. There are hoods at each booth, but they don't seem to be super helpful. They come down really low, so you kind of have to duck and weave to see the people across the booth, and also just are not really that effective. The whole restaurant was pretty hazy. 

The service was amazing though. We were joking that it felt like we weren't eating quick enough, with how fast the employees were dropping by to toss more meat on the grill, change them out, or ask if we needed anything else. 

Overall, I'd say it was an enjoyable experience and the food was good. It didn't quite live up to my San Diego memories of Manna, but I'm hoping that with some time and experience, they'll work out the kinks and get there."}
{"text":"This is the greatest Korean BBQ restaurant in Phoenix. I have to say, the staff, the food, the ambiance, all great! I didn't expect the meat to be such good quality as it's in Phoenix, but I was pleasantly surprised. $21.99 is a good price for all you can eat too, so coming from a guy who eats a lot of Korean BBQ in LA, I can say, I wholeheartedly approve of Manna BBQ!"}
{"text":"Went in today looking for a new experience and came out very dissatisfied. 

When I first came in I was made to wait several minutes before anybody even greeted me, not because they were busy mind you there was only two other customers  at the time but the two waitresses and the whole staff were all in the back room.

This place is higher in price than all other all-you-can-eat places. Was told the reason was for higher-quality  cuts of beef, and that would be understandable, however when I ordered, I found that they limit the cut to just one per person! I found a lot of things missing or they had ran out of. For instance, when I asked for glass noodles the answer was \"she hasn't made any today.\" When I asked for veggies but asked to hold the onions I was told onions and zucchini was the only veggies they had despite showing six or more on the menu. ( remember the whole reason you are paying more supposedly is because of the bigger number of choices, LOL). I was also put off by the fact that they only sell canned soda for $2 ,they do not have any Fountain drinks.

Lastly the bathroom was horrible, they supposedly sent someone to clean it before I will use it and it seems like all they did was run a wet mop literally over everything the toilet was dripping wet when I went to use the facility."}
{"text":"The biggest benefit to Manna is that the wait time for a table is considerably shorter than Gen. Aside from that, I think Gen is still the superior option, with a tastier selection of meat and sauces.

The service was good.  The atmosphere was less trendy than Gen, but that wasn't a drawback for me (I tend to like quieter places better anyhow). What was nice was how big the serving sizes were - they definitely don't skimp!

You don't get seated until the entire party is present.

However, I prefer Gen for one reason.

The reality of it all is that Gen offers spicy fried Korean chicken wings on their basic menu, and Manna BBQ does not.

And I really, really like having fried chicken as an option for KBBQ.

Take a look at Manna's basic non-premium menu. If the selection looks good enough for you, then it's probably more worth it for you to skip Gen's super long lines and just go here."}
{"text":"A decent all you can eat Korean BBQ. A nice alternative to Gen which is almost always packed. Service was a bit slow. I think if they had been more timely on getting the food out they could have turned their tables over faster. It took about 15 to 20 minutes for us to get our check, for example. We were there on a Saturday night so being busy was understandable but I would expect that they would want to get us out as soon as possible in order to seat someone else at the table.

They offer a option A and option B to their menu. Option A has more items available than Option B. Not everything on the menu was good. The basics were good like the bulgogi and kalbi. The sirloin was tough. They have a nice table setup with the exhaust fans. The kimchi selection was great. Soda is by the can and not from a fountain dispenser."}
{"text":"Cameron was a good server and the food here was amazing. This is an amazing Korean BBQ and definitely recommend people to come here and eat. The portions are huge and prices aren't to expensive. Great customer service and had an amazing dinner."}
{"text":"By far THE BEST KBBQ in town. The quality of the meat is amazing and they give pretty good portions. You can order full size or half size and we didn't have a limit as to how many we can order at a time. The workers were really friendly and service was quick. If you're ever in town and looking for some korean Bbq you should give this place a try."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try out this place but it didn't meet my expectation. First off, I walked in and noticed the grumpy faces of the two host up front, sorry but that ruined my mood. At least the guy said \"Hi, how many?\" or else I would of walked out. Our waiter was very nice but she got slammed with other tables so we had to start asking other waiters for help. 

The meats here is quite alright. Some meats are good and some can be so chewy. Their side dishes are okay. Kimchi has a overly strong taste and the potatoes are super cold... 

I really like how they have the vent above the grill so it sucks up all the smokes. 

Overall, this place can be improved with their quality of meats but I wouldn't come back all the time and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I'll be honest that I went here despite of being absolutely sick of eating korean bbq. I go once or twice a week to Gens and I gotta say I'm tired of it. Once this place opened and my brother insisted of trying it, I went along with for lunch and I'll be honest, it's very good! Walking in, the atmosphere is nice and clean. If anyone has been to the California location in San Marcos,this is the same one! With the banchan being typical, they have cilantro and onions in a sweet, sour and spicy sauce that was amazing. The meat quality here is great, and I will have to say, almost better. Thick cut galbi and a 12oz steak was amazing. It was tender and full of flavor. They also have unlimited steamed egg so that's basically life right there. The brisket portion was huge, like I'm talkin you can feed 6 people with that. The portions here are plentiful. With 2 people coming in ready to eat I was overwhelmed with the thick cut, and large proportioned meat. This is probably gonna be my next visited kbbq spot once I get back from my hiatus of kbbq. The owner is a friendly guy and I talked to working with him in the future. The service not to mention was also very friendly. I'm glad to once again put aside my korean bbq overload to try this place."}
{"text":"We got in from out of town and went straight there for lunch. The food was great and our service was phenomenal!!

      I've also eaten at one of their locations in SD and this was pretty close. 

     Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from the East Coast the best meal we've had in our weeks worth of travel.  Now we have a reason to come and visit our friends again. They are not great company but worth stomaching for a great meal like this. Definitely a must visit if you're in the area. Very clean bright food was great service is great can't say enough."}
{"text":"Issa good place to eat and has some good service as well highly recommend it cause it's not to hard to get seating and food is good"}
{"text":"I would recommend any of the marinated bbq. Their marinade has a good spice to enhance taste and not just heat."}
{"text":"Trekked to the east side to check it out. 

The good: service was decent. No one was a dick which is always nice. Soondubu soup was the best thing we had. 

The bad: the fact that the soup was the best thing we had at a Korean BBQ joint. They ran out of three things that we asked for (marinated pork, japchae and rice paper/cake) and we were there at a very reasonable 7pm. Being an all you can eat establishment, and then running out of food when that is pretty much the one expectation your guests have, is just bad business. Regarding the food itself, it was all just ok. It was borderline bland. The one thing thing that may have not been bland was the marinated pork, but they didn't have it. We opted for the more premium option, but the few premium items were just ok. 

The end: maybe they had an off night but unless I go back, which I will have a hard time justifying considering Gen is just a little bit down the way, they get a solid 2 stars and really only because the service wasn't the worst thing on earth. It also wasn't amazing either, though. So yeah, based on this experience, just go to Gen. It has a funner vibe anyways. Wait will be long though."}
{"text":"Omg... I never eat as much as I do when I go to a Korean bbq restaurant, and I cannot stop thinking about how delicious Manna was! I came here with a group of friends, and we ended up getting the A2 option (A2 is ~$22pp, and A1 is ~29pp). We all agreed that the Galbi was by far the best option - we all liked it so much that we ended up ordering at every round! 

Service was prompt and friendly, and we never felt forgotten, even though our group was in the back room. I never even had to ask for extra banchan or water refills, which I really appreciated! Also, they were able to seat a party of 7 at 8p on a Friday, with only a 5-10min wait.. that was pretty amazing considering we decided to come here last minute and hadn't called ahead for a wait estimate :)

While I've gone to a Gen in another state before, I can't compare Manna to the Gen in Az.. however, I'd assume they're pretty similar? Manna is just better for me location wise, and I like that it is right next to the new Asiana market, in case I end up needing to do grocery shopping while waiting or afterwards. If you're craving Korean bbq, I'd highly recommend coming to Manna!"}
{"text":"Manna BBQ is so good!! Super fast service and many thanks to Sharon and John for an amazing time!! Totally worth and totally coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. We are very familiar with Korean BBQ so we have some good experience to compare to. This place is an all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ restaurant. They have 2 different tiers you can order. We went with the cheaper one because we didn't think the other meats offered in the more expensive one was worth the price difference. That and we didn't really care for the other meats. The cheaper one has more than enough choices for a great experience. 

The staff was friendly. The owner came and talked to us and gave us suggestions of which meats to order. He even gave us hints to the more expensive meats on the menu, and let us know that the cheaper meats make him more money. Although the cheaper meats are very good, he said to try to fill our bellies with the more expensive ones! It was very honest and kind of him. 

The wait staff seemed a little busy but they did an acceptable job. There is a button on the wall you can push to summon them, so that is pretty nice. The restaurant is pretty crowded in the sense that there is not a lot of space to walk around. The tables are close together and the paths of travel tend to get congested. 

The woman's restroom is a bit wacky. One of the toilet stalls are so small, there is no way you can sit and use it. It seems that the restrooms were retrofitted to an existing space. It's definitely not an acceptable size, but there is another toilet next to it that is big enough. I just thought it was funny. 

Overall, this is one of the best in the PHX area. I haven't tried Gen BBQ yet, but I have heard this place gives it a run for its money."}
{"text":"This place was amazing and will now be my go-to for korean bbq. The service was great! Everyone was very nice and attentive. The meat was high quality and the portions are big compared to other places. I highly recommend the nuk gan sal jimooluk (marinated rib meat) and bulgogi. The sides are great as well- cucumbers were my favorite."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was awesome! The servers work really hard to make sure you are happy with the food and if you need a grill change they will do it right away. There's a lot of options for side dishes and the meat was totally worth the price, really yummy. You can tell everyone there is busting their ass for the customers which is something you don't see everyday. I originally went to Gen BBQ over at Tempe marketplace but the wait during the weekends gets up to 3+ hours so we decided to try Manna. No wait, food was probably better, and servers were friendly. Go try it out!"}
{"text":"I agree with the other one star review. I walked in and it took ten minutes  before anyone greet us. When they did they told us we still had to wait for for them to clean a table. There were empty tables everywhere in there. 
We were there at 2:30 pm in the afternoon. Almost ready to walk out. 

This is the worst customer service ever. You have to ask at least 3 times for the same stuff before they will bring it to you. They don't really clean the tables and you'll see how bad the service if you eat here. 

I just feel they need to add more help and also servers that speak English. 
When you leave this place your entire body , hair, and clothes will smell of nasty bbq smoke."}
{"text":"Food are pretty decent for the price. We got the $21.99 portion, and kids under 5 can eat for free. Meat portions and meal selections were good and were marinated on point. However, service can't be considered top notch since we literally had to flag the servers for extra things here and there. It was so confused because our first waitress completely disappeared after take our first order, and left it to the other colleagues to take care of our table for the rest of the night. Grills were changed constantly, but no water refilled or food refilled. 

We are still going back, just because of the food. I hope that service could be improved better."}
{"text":"Korean BBQs are everywhere in SoCal and Phoenix Area. We are often disappointed. Not this time. Excellent food and service. Nice ambiance and great sides. One of our favorites."}
{"text":"First time and not my last time.  Amazing selection of meats  for the price.  Other places would take forever to bring your selected meat but here it's virtually immediate. Our menu advisor was excellent for suggestions on what to order. Thank you very much Sharon for making my first experience an enjoyable one. One thing that makes this a game changer, all the egg souffle you can eat. This is a must go to for all you can eat korean bbq."}
{"text":"Manna BBQ offers great food. Never had a bad experience. Customer service and food is amazing! Fresh ingredients and great prices comparing to other competitors. If you like to have fun cooking and hanging out with friends you are at the right price! Just be careful for dinner on weekdays because the last call is at 9:10 even they close at 10. Unfortunately we found that out when we walked in at 9pm so we decided to leave and come back another time."}
{"text":"Had their $22 all you can eat bbq.  The meat was good and I'll def be back.  The seating was a bit tight and packed for my liking.  But there were tons of people and the service was good.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.   The first top five meat offerings were all great."}
{"text":"**updated review** Returned the next day (I know!) with a large group and had the premium tier this time and I now must up my review to 5 stars!  Beef tongue and brisket are definitely juicier than Gen.  The sliced rib meat  (2nd on the menu) is tender yummy.  We made reservations with no hassle and service was fantastic for a group of 12. ***

3rd all you can eat kbbq to open in East valley this year!  Great quality meat with no wait (for now at least).  Only been open a week but imagine it will get busier later especially after the new giant Asian market opens next door!  This place is bright and clean and has individual adjustable pull down vents so you're not smoked out while cooking.  Staff was super attentive and meat came out fast.  Choose from $21.99 for basics or $28.99 for premium with steak and beef tongue. The beef deckle here is juicy and great quality.  Pork belly was not impressive but will try again to see if it was a one-off.  Kalbi decent and included in $21.99 set!  They also have deliciously thin radish wrap but no rice paper. This is definitely a go-to if I am craving kbbq and don't want to wait 2 hours at Gen.  Reservations too!"}
{"text":"Manna BBQ is the new top spot for Korean BBQ. Two meat options for the buffet. One is $22 the other for the more premium meets and sea food is $29.  It's all you can eat. Service was great and the meat was good quality. The side dishes and kimchi were very good too. I will be back here again. Glad they are close by."}
{"text":"Okay. My fiancé and I, huge fans of Gen, decided to come here and check it out. Long story short: just go to Gen. Anyways...

We got the A1 menu ($27.99) because my fiancé just cannot go without beef tongue, and I love me some rib meat. I wasn't a fan that I had to pay $6 more to have access to the full menu, but to each their own.

The meat was fine. The brisket was definitely better than Gen (I usually don't enjoy the sliced meats), but that was about it. The rib meat was just, so bad. Tasted like it had been soaked in sesame oil, which I'm personally not a fan of (if you can't get enough of sesame oil, you'll probably love it). This was disappointing, since the rib meat at Gen is my favorite. It was also a bit tough. The galbi was alright, but not as tasty as Gen.

Also, the food portions are 2-3x bigger than the portions at Gen, which was not ideal for us, personally. We like to order a lot of different things, but after 4 plates at Manna, we were full. So much on the menu that we didn't get to try.

As for atmosphere, the restaurant looks boring inside, as opposed to Gen, which looks sleek and hip, with a giant TV wall. I have to say that the service at Manna was great, though, and the food was served quickly.

I feel bad putting this place up against Gen, but it's just so hard not to given the proximity. If you're trying to choose a Korean BBQ, do yourself a favor and go to Gen."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday lunch at 11am.  Chose the $22 per person menu.  Plan to try the more expensive option later.

Tried beef brisket, bulgogi, Galb, baby octopus and pork belly,   All were very good.  My new favorite is the beef brisket.  Steam egg dish was very good as well.

Manna is very similar to Gen in Tempe Marketplace.  Biggest difference is the wait.  There isn't any when we went.  

It does get a bit smoky in the restaurant.  So be prepared to smell like bbq when you finish.

They do have TV on the wall everywhere.  So it was nice to watch NFL football and eat BBQ meat at the same time."}
{"text":"I went here a few days ago with 2 of my friends. The service was really nice and our waitress Sharon attended to us so well. She catered to our needs by constantly checking if we needed anything. She wasn't annoying or pushy but very helpful when we couldn't decide on what we wanted. The atmosphere and vibe was relaxed, I can't wait to come back here."}
{"text":"I've been to many Korean BBQ places in LA but it's seems to as good or better than the places there. Alex was an amazing server and the staff was very friendly. Ate the A2 menu which was $22.99 which is definitely worth for the good quality meat and all of the sides. Definitely would be back again soon :)"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Korean BBQ and I've been to this place twice now. The food is really good and tasty. I can't really say much about the food since this more cook yourself type of restaurant. I enjoyed the fast friendly service. They always have people coming over and checking up on us for refill or to order food. I also like how they have a separate room for big parties like a birthday. The meat that comes out is always freshly prepared and displayed really nice. Their tofu and egg drop soup tastes good. I even got the little macaroon dessert! However, the only thing I can complain about is how their brisket it very bland and uneventful. And they don't have spicy bulgogi either. If you compare to Gen I say the meat quality and seasoning is better at Gen but for the price for dinner is cheaper at Manna. I wouldn't mind coming here if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. My friend and I got the A2 and tried the beef brisket, spicy pork, small intestines, and the baby octopus. They were all very delicious and you could tell they were high quality. The banchan were really good too I never had macaroni salad at a Korean barbecue place. The staff was very attentive and frequently changed out our grills, the interior of the restaurant is really nice, and the bathrooms are situated at the perfect spot right in the front area. Lol I definitely will be coming back here regularly. It's the best Korean all you can eat place I've tried in Arizona so far."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best Korean BBQ's in the area!

I love Manna because there isn't much of a wait, they offer larger tables in a private room if you have a large party and all the meat was top quality. 

We went here for my friends birthday with a party of 7. We were seated within minutes and the service was attentive. The whole table was adorned with sides and accompaniments while we waited to choose. They offer Soju though you need to check what flavors they offer. If you are eating as a group, make sure you all choose the same meat selection as they whole table has to be the same.

The beef was great quality and they let us order enough meat for one for each person. The pork belly was delicious, falvorful and the best part, you get to cook it yourself!!! You get to order as much meat as you want for 2 hours. Also they have steamed egg which was perfect and rice that you can order with your other choices. 

One of the neat features is each station has a fan you can pull down to help pull up the smoke and heat. The price was decent, we spent $21 a person and although it was the cheaper option, the meat wasn't poor quality.

Tons of free parking in the area and they have other local businesses nearby such as a bakery, korean beauty and boba. So check it out and make it a fun day."}
{"text":"Hmmm, where to begin? 
First, the service was okay untill the end, where they literally rushed us out. Like, come on, let us finish eating before you come and clear off the table. Mind you, we were literally almost done eating anyways, another 5 minute would not have killed you, you know.  I get it, you had a reservation coming in and we were sitting in the area. Could of offer to move us to another table, and made us at least feel welcome instead of like we were a waste of space. So there was that. 
Second, I do not have another kbbq place to compare to in AZ, so the meats here were okay. However, the tofu soup was very good. (So one star for that)
Overall, it could of been better, but I guess it must of been an off night for them. Would I go back? Oh, tough question, but most likely not. I like to at least feel welcome to an establishment. 
Everybody will have a different experience, so maybe others will enjoy eating here, but sadly, not me.  So to all, happy grilling."}
{"text":"I came here for vacation with some friends and we decided we wanted Kbbq. Our waitresses, Sharon, was super sweet and helpful! We were all super hungry and she served us what we ordered very quickly !!!!! Will definitely come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Great service compared to the other all you can eat bbq in Tempe....food is amazing and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"A new Korean BBQ place that opened up right next to the new and impressive Asiana Market location. I don't know what's going on in West Mesa with all Korean spots popping up, but I'm loving it! All you can eat heaven!

A few rules to All you can Eat Korean BBQ: you can pick out 2-3 meats at a time (we got two different answers on two different occasions). There is a 2 hour maximum, so don't expect to camp out all day just stuffing your face. Large portions of meat that was not eaten may be an additional charge, so don't get your eyes bigger than your tummy! 

TIPS: 

Don't forget that you are the grillmaster, so ask your server how to control the heat volume before throwing down on some K-BBQ. There are doorbells at each table to summon your server for when you're ready to place another order. 

I highly recommend getting the premium meat package just under $30 per person. Everything we tried-pork, chicken, beef was all good quality and premium cuts. I like to order a small bowl of rice and thinly sliced radishes (called \"moo\"). Ban Chan (side dishes) are good to add to each protein bite. My fave is using the moo (radish slice) as a mini taco. I put a bit of rice, meat, & gochujang red paste on the moo slice and eat it in one bite. It is so bomb. Get creative, mix and match flavors!

Try a bottle of soju (clear rice wine) with friends, or some makkoli (creamy, white rice wine--the oldest alcoholic beverage in Korea) to catch a buzz. Then head over next door for some dessert to go at the bakery, Tous Les Jours, which so much reminds me of the popular bakery chain in Seoul, Paris Baguette. Or walk off your meal and check out Asiana Market--an awesome Korean grocery store. 

Manna BBQ is not only a great all you can eat experience with quality food-- it is also part of a K-town movement that is unfolding right before our eyes here in the Valley."}
{"text":"They offer two different menu's, and we got their regular one. Overall, we thought it was pretty good value for the money. Their LA Galbi was amazing! Finally, their service was attentive -- Alex was great!"}
{"text":"We have explored many different Korean AYCE restaurants and Korean restaurants in Phoenix. Last night we visited Manna with our friends. The food was great! I've noticed that other Korean BBQ places have a propane taste- Manna does not. 

At $22, you cant beat it! All you can eat bulgogi, tofu soup, galbi, side dishes, steamed egg pot and more! They give you rice which Sizzle in North Scottsdale doesn't. They make you pay extra! 

Can't wait to come back with more friends and family!"}
{"text":"Very yummy Bulgogi - no rice paper, but they use thin radish instead which surprisingly tastes extremely similar. Make sure you ask for someone to explain everything to you in English (Scarlett was so so helpful and informative). Had a great lunch!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! We got there early to avoid any waiting. The quality of meat was good for AYCE and the portions and cuts were way better then GEN. The service was wonderful and friendly. The only thing was that the table was a little dirty when we sat down, but I talked with the server and they cleaned it right up. Highly recommended! I use to live in LA so I compare most Korean BBQ places to LA. This place is far the best so far."}
{"text":"Went to Manna for dinner and was blown away by their outstanding service and great selection of Korean dishes. Our hostess Shannon was very welcoming and took the time explaining why they're different from other Korean BBQ restaurants. She stated, they take pride on customer service, serve high quality meat and properly marinate them. My dinner experience, exceeded my expectation. I left happy, full and ready to come back next week.If you're in the area then this a must try!"}
{"text":"Manna is THE best Korean BBQ in the Mesa/Tempe/East Valley area!  Their portions are huge.  Their meats are perfectly marinated.  Their servers are attentive and kind.  
This is actually my 4th time visiting and I have always left pleased with no complaints!  Even their bathrooms are clean!  
I have visited Gen BBQ, too.  Manna is so far ahead of Gen in all aspects!  
Thank you Manna BBQ for satisfying me every single time!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! On top of that, the service was exceptional. I've been to a handful of Korean BBQ places, and this was one of the best for sure. I would absolutely recommend! Delicious authentic Korean cuisine cooked right at your table! Delightful!"}
{"text":"Ohhhhh Manna! It's hard to find the right word to describe this place because I'm afraid I wouldn't use one that is good enough.

The staff is very fun and friendly, food is amazing and atmosphere is always sizzling. 

As someone who has had some of the best Korean food ranging from Tucson to Glendale, I would give Manna my 10 star professional foodie rating if I could.

Now stop reading reviews and get your butt over to Manna!

{"text":"First experience was last night with my friend and her son. 
We were told there was a long wait we ended up being sat really quickly and getting our drink orders taken immediately. 

Today, I come here with my boyfriend to eat..
We walk in Get sat, 
We wait for 15, it shouldn't take that long for us to have someone come by and Greet us, give us drinks or even take our drink order. 
No Ban Chan set up around, 
I press the call button, no one shows up to ask if we need something...
They turn off the alert and ignore us. 

We wait a few minutes longer. 
I get up and go I ask to speak to the Manager, 
She comes to me, doesn't offer an Apology, no explanation to why we aren't getting any service. 

It was very upsetting cause last night it was super busy, today it was not busy at all, there were a lot of empty tables. 

Please do not support this type of business. 
I love korean food, lived in Korea for a long time I am not brand new to the culture. 

I'm very upset about how these people behaved. 
Especially the manager who decided to Do nothing about it. 


You want a better experience go to GEN ! Tempe market place. 
Quality of food is much better at GEN 
The marinades and Sauces are delicious. 
Manna Is a terrible excuse for Korean food."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something about my good friend Alex. He is hands down the best server we ever had. Very attentive to our needs. Meat is very high quality. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Attention: Biblical Scholars are wrong. Jesus was NOT from the Middle East. Jesus was Korean!

Literally, a gift from the heavens, Manna BBQ is a culinary blessing. Fresh, delicious meats, extremely bright and flavorful banchan, impeccable service. 

The price is right, the location is convenient. Go! Just do it. Skip church, this is all you need. Galbi 1:28"}
{"text":"I love coming here. My second time in 6 days. The bulgogi marinade is AMAZING. The crew constantly comes to check in on you in a non annoying sense of the word. Scarlett was an Excellent hostess. Smiling and an awesome attitude."}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ in town and it is nice to have a go to place in Phoenix! The server Alex had mad skillz and was dedicated to our experience! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I love how big the portions are compared to other AYCE kbbq places and it's much more affordable. The service was exceptional, they were very attentive to our needs. Thank you Alex for being such an awesome server!!!!! Will definitely be back again. :)"}
{"text":"Manna is a great ayce kbbq restaurant. The staff does a great job delivering the food in a timely manner. Also, the meat quality is great and always ready to eat.

The hostess, Scarlett, does a great job providing a table and assisting us if needed. She has a positive attitude and enjoys working here to her full potential. 

My only concern is why japchae is on the menu, but is only served as a side dish. I had the impression that it would be a family sized serving.

I recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try kbbq for the first time. The staff has no issues with helping customers who have never been before."}
{"text":"I've eaten at other Manna BBQ spots in California so this gave me something to compare it to. 

We were craving Korean bbq while visiting family out in Phoenix. First off there was really no wait which was nice. The staff were kind of all over the place. The cuts of meat were not as good as they are in CA. However they were definitely flavorful. 

Overall good experience and we'd probably give this place another try when we go back. It seems like they're relatively new so they might be ironing out all the kinks."}
{"text":"The BBQ is very good, the mean is fresh and flavorful, they constantly change the grill so your not eating burnt food. Only thing is on occasion there are certain items on the menu are not avaliable, this happens more then it should which is why I docked it 1 star.  Another reason for the minus one star is the host is lacking, you often stand there 5 minutes or more before you even get anyone to acknowledge you and ask you how many people."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Korean food, so I don't really know what should be good and what not. They were busy when we got there and we had to wait about half an hour for our table. The problem was it took them too long to clean a table. Anyway, we got our table, sat down, and started ordering our food. Although it is a \"All You Can Eat\" restaurant, you can only order three items at one time. Food was all right, not the best but not the worst. This restaurant is located in the very back corner, people can easily miss this joint. Overall, it was an okay meal."}
{"text":"Customer Service here is outstanding everyone there worked as a team. We were checked up and asked if we needed anything not from just our assigned waitress. Also, the grill was changed out when needed no need to ask. They are really attentive. 

The food quality is greater than GEN for sure. We did the A1 and got Rib Eye Steak, Galbi, short rib filet, pork belly, beef belly, brisket, steam egg, tofu soup, japchae glass noodles. 

It was my first time here and this place exceeded our expectations. This will be my go to spot from now on if I'm ever craving KBBQ."}
{"text":"After looking around Phoenix for the best Korean bbq experience, here is the winner.
The place is clean, the staff friendly and the food quality excellent.
It is also cheaper than other Korean barbecue places such as Sizzle."}
{"text":"Oh my God! This is the best way barbecue have ever been to. I'm going to fly back to Mesa just so that way I can enjoy this delicious food.

I highly recommend the bulgogi, the spicy chicken, the brisket. Heck. Get anything you want. It's amazing. Just come here and wait till your hearts content!"}
{"text":"So good. Great price. You should try it. Bulgogi is excellent. Love the kimchi and tofu soup."}
{"text":"Every time I went to CA I had to make a trip to AYCE KBBQ, so I'm pleased that KBBQ has made it's way to the valley.  In the valley, I've had Gen and Gangnam.  I've found Manna has better meats than both.  Gen has better options in terms of off-grill items (like KFC and Gyoza) but I'd still choose Manna just for the quality of meats.  Price is fair for AYCE Korean BBQ and about what the average cost is in CA.  For service, at first, I thought it was lacking, but I started using the call button that's on each table.  Once I did that, service was superb.  I've noticed as of late service has been more proactive and much better.  Since coming here, I stopped going and trying other KBBQ places in the valley with the exception of going to Gen one more time.  However, that experience at Gen was definitely lacking and they've gone downhill since they first opened.  I look forward to my monthly visit to Manna every first of the month.  I would go more often, but I got to keep my belly size in check :)."}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite place for AYCE BBQ in Phoenix! Everything from the food and service was good. I loved that we didn't have to wait forever to get seated like other BBQ places. The quality of meat was really good and flavorful. Good selection of side dishes and I especially loved the steam eggs! The servers are attentive and helpful and we never had to wait long for the food. They also have a call button that you can use if you need your server to come to your table. That definitely reminds me of the restaurants in LA. We really enjoyed our food and definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"Tristan was a wonderful server. He got me everything that I wanted in a timely manner. Mana has such wonderful customer service that I would come here again without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Pricing: 
Great KBBQ! For $21.99 (or $27.99 for the premium).
Definitely go for the A1, Cause I like beef tongue. 
Probably my go to KBBQ, because price is reasonable. Meat is fresh and good. I prefer their marinated galbi. 

Also, No long wait for a table Vs. Gen BBQ!!!
Kind of hidden location next to the supermarket. 

Been here 2 times already. 
Pretty consistent with service and quality of food. 
I do recommend coming in a group of at least 4, as always a bigger group means you will be able to try all or most of the meats, and you will be able to finish the meats, so you don't get charge for over ordering.

Food:
good selection of meats for kbbq. Has all your basic types.
Galbi, bulgogi, LA galbi*, beef tongue*, brisket*. 
* = i like
Get tongs for everyone to use and cook.
Make sure to control the temp as you cook. 

yes to: Japchae, steam egg, and salad for fiber

Service:
Friendly and pretty fast.
tip: Use the wall button to get flag down a waiter or waitress 

Parking:
nice big plaza outside the supermarket plaza

Come check this place out."}

The bright side is they only charge $10.99 for my portion vs. $21.99 for his.  Oops, forgot take the picture of the meat.  Well, next time   then."}
{"text":"One of the top KBBQ spots in Phoenix for sure. We have been to almost every single one across the valley, and we keep coming back to Manna here in Mesa. 

The service is outstanding, the meat quality is great, the banchan is delicious! Try to get here early as it does fill up fast, but the wait is definitely worth it. 

It's always fun to try some of the different meats they have, the Octopus was pretty tasty, and also the small intestine! 

The servers are very friendly and accommodating if you need any refills, extra sides, etc. 

Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Sooooo amazing!!! The meat is so good, and fresh! They are very generous when it comes to giving out meat! It's not that paper thin slice, it's legit! They servers are all so very nice and they don't rush you. They have two different menu sizes to choose from. The food is very worth the price. Steamed egg is very good as well. Wish they had rice paper!!!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to come try this place since I went to Gen so many times already. We went with the A2 to see how the basic selection would fare, and from what I had, it is satisfactory. Mainly, the important item that was available was galbi short ribs. At Gen, you cannot get the galbi short ribs unless it was during dinner time. At Manna, you can get it for the A2 tier of $21.99 although you do miss the variety of meat items even compared to the lunch menu at Gen like Hawaiian Steak.

When I say basic, you really do get the basic of items in A2 from a few beef items to a few pork items to a few chicken items to a few seafood items. It's not necessarily bad unless you are looking for jowl or something fancy at Manna.

The service wasn't terrible either (not as good as Gen) since we never got a our water, and we had to manually request a grill change but... whatever. The atmosphere is more of a restaurant compared to Gen's nightclub decor.

When it comes to side dishes, Manna beats out Gen with seaweed. I love seawood. And Manna serves steamed egg. Seriously... why doesn't Gen serve steamed egg??? Manna also have non-marinaded octopus (non-spicy) too!

***************************************************************************

I would recommend Manna based on certain \"if-then\" conditions...

1. If you are looking to go cheap at $15.99 with steak and jowl and a TOTAL OF 31 ITEMS, then go to Gen during lunch times.

2. If you are looking to go cheap and MUST EAT seaweed, beef galbi, and steamed egg, then go to Manna for the A2 20 item menu at $21.99.

3. If you are looking to spend $24.99 for the full 37 item menu and don't care about seaweed and steamed egg, then go to Gen for dinner.

4. If you just want the full 27 item menu with seaweed and steamed egg for $28.99, then go to Manna for their A1 tier.

Of course, neither is really better than the other. There are some items on Gen's full menu that's not on Manna's menu, so pick your restaurant based on what you want to eat and the price point you want to pay!"}
{"text":"Visited last week Friday on a lunch date with my husband.  As soon as I walked in, the delicious aroma of the Korean BBQ made my stomach grumble.  You pick between two menus.  Everyone at the table has to agree to order from the same menu.  

The food was delicious, waiters are very friendly and my favorite part was their call button.  Yes, they have a call button! Try placing your order at Gens, all their waiters are busy trying to act busy, but Manna's they check up on you.  Great service!

The downside to Manna's was when I used the daikon wrap for my meat, I had to spit out the mouthful of food into my napkin because I swear I could taste ammonia.  I don't know how well try to avoid cross contaminating their food, but I definitely tasted it on the daikon wraps.  

The second downside of Manna's BBQ is their drinks.  For $1.99 you get one can of soda & no refills :( If you want a refill, pay another buck 99 for another can. 

To offset the negative, for parents with children, they have a set rate of $10.99 for kids up to 10 or 12. I can't remember.  Gens measure your kid and if they're 40 inches (I could be wrong with the height), you pay full price.  I call that discrimination on Gens. Ha! 

Oh, and their hot soups are so tasty! I loved it!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch since I live in Glendale, it was really excited to me after found another All you can eat KBBQ. 

Food: I love the food here, really fresh and well seasoned. Overall, I have no complaints for this.

Cost: They have 2 kind of AYCE. I believe is $23.99 and $28.99 for the upgrade. With me, I think it's a little high since in GEN, they have more food but only $24.99

Service: This is the reason why I gave them 2 stars. We being served by an old Korean lady, and whenever we want to order more food, she gave us a look that we are BEGGING for food, which is make me really upset since we have to pay a lot for our lunch 

Hopefully that they would be more better in service since I really love the food here."}
{"text":"If you want to try the best Korean BBQ in Arizona, you have to go to Manna!  It's the best, and oh yeah... It's all you can eat BBQ.  The quality of meat is very good!  It quality meat at Manna makes a big difference between Gen and other competitors!  The wait time is not that bad.  Most of the time, they can get you in right away!  All the servers are very nice and friendly!  But, if you want the best service, you need to ask for Helen!  She is #1.   I will definitely be going back many more times!"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for my birthday and it was definitely a good one! It was the first time trying Korean bbq and I had a great time. The staff were really helpful in explaining the menu and the process to us and they were very attentive despite being super busy. Definitely coming again!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty bomb. The quality of the meat is way better than Gen. I love how they had a little more to offer regarding side dishes. I'd definitely come back! Definitely come visit Sharon. She's dope."}
{"text":"Manna is probably the best korean bbq place here in AZ.  They have good soups and their meat quality is way above Gen's in Tempe market place. Also, there isn't usually a long wait to eat here which is a huge plus.  I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a good all you can eat korean bbq place."}
{"text":"Great place to visit with friends! Fun and yum vsuper veriety of meats! Soooooooo goooooood!"}
{"text":"Had a great time got to full for our own good awsome place to go to . Plus our server Alex was great and awsome to thumbs up to him"}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of the best Korean BBQ places I've been to in Arizona. First off the place was super clean and the music ambiance was more casual than the hipster look. I went to lunch with my wife and it was a great experience. The service was super friendly as well. The addition of the movable vent hoods and call button made for less smoke and easy service calls for more meat. 

The meat itself was great: good cuts of meat with good marbleization. The marinated bulgogi was delicious as well. One of the huge pluses too was the meat was fresh and came out rolled (instead of the lukewarm meat I've been served before). This makes for unraveling and grilling a lot easier. 

Overall, I'd definitely be coming back to this place. Maybe dinner though since I can try even more types of meat."}
{"text":"I checked out gen a few times and wanted to try this place. This place does give you more meat per plate but honestly I didn't think it was tasty. We didn't get that great of service and seemed short staffed. You have a choice of getting so so selection for $21 or premium for a little bit more. This place is a lot cozier and not as open space as gen. Food was ok. But I prefer gen better"}
{"text":"This is real deal, legit Korean BBQ! All you can eat, yakiniku style. Can't go wrong. All the meats were pretty tasty, and with a pretty wide selection.

Not to mention the service. The entire staff, including Alex & Sharron was very helpful, and attentive. We'll definitely be back. Just be sure to come hungry."}
{"text":"This is the best KBBQ in Arizona! The service is always amazing, and our server Alex was very attentive and friendly. Will recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"Very nice set up, all the meats were well marinated. No need for dipping meat in sauce. Very flavorful. Ban Chan was alright nothing special. And yes! They had steamed eggs. Will be back forsure."}
{"text":"This would probably be a 4-star but read below for why it is 2.

I have been to many Korean BBQ places and I know good meat when I eat them. This place has EXCELLENT meats, specifically the ribeye and the beef tongue. If you are stopping by for the first time, I highly recommend to try these two meats. Even though beef tongue may not sound as appetizing to some, the meat looks very different than a \"tongue\" that you would imagine. It also has a total different level of texture that may be surprising to you. Manna's dark-looking dipping sauce is really delicious. Do try to dip your meats in it. I would grill jalapenos and garlic that you can request and put them in this delicious sauce for some spiciness!

Here are why it is a 2-star review. First of all, we paid about 30$ per person for the highest all-you-can-eat tier. You would think it is truly all you can eat; however, they put a limitation on the ribeye. I was told by the waitress that we cannot get another piece of ribeye because there are only two of us. Only one piece is provided for a party of  2, two pieces for a party of 3 and three pieces for a party of 5. In my head I was thinking \"so is it half a piece if I go in and eat by myself? What about a party of 4?\" This really doesn't make any sense and there is no sign in the front desk or on the menu about such limitation. I call this a scam. Second, the vent wasn't working at all. In fact, none of the vents were functional. We were dying of smokes from our table and all the other tables. 

Besides the complaints above, their side dishes were average and their service was neither excellent nor terrible. BE WARNED: soft drinks are NOT REFILLIABLE."}
{"text":"Very very dissappointed. We actually detoured from visiting a competitor in Tempe because Manna had a 1/2 Star advantage. Folks also frequently cited Manna's freshness over the Tempe competition. Again, to my extreme disappointment, freshness was NOT featured in our visit to Manna.

We ordered from the A1 Premium Menu. 

OK, so what was good? The Banchan was very fresh and tasty. The Bulgogi was good, sliced surprisingly thin, but good. Had I just stayed with the Banchan, Bulgogi, and Spicy Pork Galbi it would have been a pretty good visit.

But dear God, everything else was off. The Chicken tasted off and its texture indicated it was far past its acceptable shelflife. The ribeye was barely passable. I could go on about the other items. But really all you have to know is the shrimp was crumbly and disgusting.

When I got home I looked this stuff up. Good, raw shrimp bodies should be firm and translucent. Shrimp should still be attached to the shell; if the shrimp's body has detached from the shell or has fallen apart within the shell, it's likely bad. Cooked shrimp meat should have a firm, white interior with a hint of pink on the exterior; don't purchase or eat mushy cooked shrimp. The eyes should be glossy and moist; if they are missing or shrunken, the shrimp may not be fresh. Raw shrimp heads should be firmly attached to the bodies, and you should have to use a firm pinch to remove the heads from cooked shrimp.

Yeah, big fail in all categories there. Check the crumbly shrimp pictures.

Got my $80 lesson. Learn from me."}
{"text":"First time here. Food was good, service was nice. Alex was incredible! He was very attentive and friendly. The price is a little on the high side, but there are good quality meat. Our favorite is the Goutsal! Tender and yummy"}
{"text":"I think between the A1 and A2, just get the A2 for $22/person unless you care for beef tongue. I tried all the extra items in the A1 and nothing was good except beef tongue. They cut it thick here and it's better than gen. Other than that, the galbi was good and is already on A2. Everything else was chewy or maybe the portion was too big so I didn't enjoy it. I'm more interested in being able to try different items but I felt grossed out when they brought out what seemed like 1lb of meat per order... so overkill. The ban chan side dishes and salad weren't as good as gen but I did like the tofu soup which gen doesn't know how to make at all."}
{"text":"Great KBBQ! For $21.99 (or $27.99 for the premium), this is really not bad for Arizona! Plus, coming from San Diego, seeing this location open up in my new home just makes my heart happy.

The meat selection meets your standard kbbq expectations and the quality is pretty good. I also appreciate the variety of ban chan and salad! The staff was super super attentive, and we had our grills changed without needing to ask once. The best part is, coming in around 7:30pm on a Friday, there was NO WAIT. We walked right in and got started with our grillin' ASAP. This will definitely be my go to spot when I have a mad craving to stuff my face with kbbq in Arizona!"}
{"text":"This place I am recommending to every single person i know. So much quality food and all you can eat!  21.99 ? May seem little high but  it is really worth the pricing. 

You need to pick meats wisely though. You won't probably know which one is best unless you're familiar with each part of meat and what you like the best. Also gop chang ( intestine) and some meats were kinda tough to chew. So be sure to know what you want or bring a Korean friend who can guide you. 

They will charge for left over food so it may not be a good idea to experiment a lot.

I would suggest Chadolbaegi and Woo Sam Gyup (my favorite) for a couple rounds. Those two are very soft and thin that can be eaten easily."}
{"text":"Came here after waiting more than 30 minutes at another spot to find ourselves seated immediately and welcomed with a friendly staff. Our waiter Cameron was amazing with a great personality and very helpful. The food was amazing also and the staff was constantly checking on us to make sure everything was good and even changed out the grill a few times. Amazing service and experience. Definitely coming back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Quality of meat was GREAT! Alex (our server) provided quick and excellent service. Family had a fun time with the hands on experience, cooking their meat! Will definitely be back for Mana!"}
{"text":"This is my first review since I created my account few years ago.I know Manna is generally from California. I am a Korean and a big fan of Korean bbq. I have been to Gangnam and Gen several times. Service and the meats are way better than those two places. I didn't try the meats that are marinated (Gen's arinated meats might be better than here). Since this place is not advertised yet, there is no waiting list. I believe this place will be crowded once it is well known to the other big fan of Korean bbq like me."}
{"text":"This place is definitely affordable and you get a lot of food but don't expect it to be top notch. The portions are way too big (we were a party of four) so we couldn't get everything we wanted, no they don't do half portions. Sesame oil and soy sauce are the only dipping sauce options. The sides are pretty good I guess. We had to chase down our waiter for water and our bill. On top of everything we were charged for things we didn't order. I wouldn't personally go back but it's worth trying out"}
{"text":"Great KBBQ option in AZ. The portions are huge, but you can order a half portion (I would recommend this). The meat quality is pretty good and definitely comparable to Gen BBQ. The wait time is significantly less than Gen's typical wait during dinner. Compared to Gen, the banchan selection at Manna is great and you also have better tofu soup and the option to have a steamed egg. The only complaint I have here is that the bulgogi is quite acidic and may not be what you would normally expect. We loved the Galbi though! The service is very attentive and prompt, so no need to worry about the time limit."}
{"text":"We ate the A1 menu cause of the beef tougue. They has a wide variety of meat to select from. My favorite is wrap the meat in the radish wrap. Our server Sharon help me out a lot. She was quick at getting our food and was really sweet. A1 service. 5/5 star would come again."}
{"text":"(In 'mother dearest' fashion) noo rice papersssss! This was one of two biggest fails for me...this, and the onion salad. The latter is more forgivable since most kbbq places don't have it but given that the one place that does is its cali locations, it's hard not to compare. The place was nice, as clean as a kbbq joint can be and felt familiar. We'd been hankering for ayce kbbq and were excited when we heard gen was opening up, but even more excited when we realized there was a manna location opening up much closer. The staff were friendly, the food was good but their lack of rice paper and the realization they did not have the onion salad was so heartbreaking... im being dramatic. It's good, it's cheaper than gen, and normally not as busy. You don't get all the same items but you pay for what you get, and it'll satiate our needs until our trips back  to cali to the infallable 9.99 joints we're used to."}
{"text":"Manna BBQ....sigh  I secretly kinda hope that this place doesn't get too LIT, cuz I love this place and don't want to fight the lines or for the server's attention like other popular KBBQ places. 

I'm pretty sure y'all already know the whole thang with KBBQs by now, so imma just point out the things that make this place stand out. 

Portion size - they. are. HUGE. Like if GEN brings one order of let's say beef belly, then the same one order here would be like two to three times the GEN's portion size. I LOVE that. I means it's gonna be AYCE already, no need to be stingy right? Manna BBQ, well at least currently, are doing portion sizes right 

Price - kind of the same deal as other place. I think Mon - Thurs for lunch it's .. 17.99? That's pretty nice :) Fri-Sun is just always dinner prices. 

Meat - okay y'all, I have always been a brisket kind of guy. But you know how sometimes the brisket can be just  but sometimes it's like \"eh\" and a bit dry? So here's the deal, get the BEEF BELLY. it's straight .com  it's like FATTY and soft and chewy and my goodness. Yea trust me you won't go wrong. 

I also tried the premium menu a couple times, and they have this like \"jumoolok\" or something, a rib fillet and that meats marbling is quite ridiculous. So soft and tender. 

I'm always a fan of the pork cheek, it's also on point here, but so is their pork belly. Nice and thick slices, also a fav. 

Want something marinated? get the LA something galbi or bulgogi, but I'm more a non marinated type of guy. 

Long story short : the KBBQ joint that has taken over GEN's number one spot for me"}
{"text":"The sides are good but the meat could definitely be better. They just didn't taste fresh."}
{"text":"Today, I have made a visit to the second All you can eat Korean barbecue restaurant that have opened in the last month. The popularity and the expectations are great since these places are here in the valley to satisfy the cravings of meat loving foodies for all you can eat service.
Right out of the bat, the concept of all you can eat might question the restaurant's quality of the food and service however, at Manna Korean Barbecue Restaurant there was nothing but not only quantity but quality. First, when you walk in the bright smiles from the host and server greets you as you are guided to either a booth or tables that could fit a big party. The server has picked a big open table for us since the at the time of our visit was before the dinner rush. Looking around I was able to see the neat table with bright colored booth that was extremely comfortable to sit in for hours. There were televisions everywhere, pleasurable music coming from the speakers throughout the restaurant filling the missing spots just enough to sound enjoyable among the sounds of meats being grilled. For the menu, I was provided two options. For different prices, there were more options of meats. The most expensive option having six more different types of meats, I went with the option that I could try every type of entrée from the restaurant which was priced at $28.99 per person. A bit on the expensive side, there is an option for $21.99 however, they provided enough options so you won't be missing out on
the house specials. I was impressed with all the variety of meats that came out and tasted absolutely great. It was very interactive where I had to grill myself. Each order of entrée plates came out bright red and marvelously. My personal favorites being beef bellies, bulgogi, and spicy pork bellies, after every bite I was in awe of how incredible it tasted. These meats not only tasted great but I felt the amount of work and effort was shown with every cut of the meat that came out. They were tender, without the foul smell that I would usually expect at an all you can eat restaurant--since coming from Korea I know how it usually goes. They definitely scored both quality and quantity side of the restaurant which made me even be worried about the restaurant's budget. Lastly, the cherry on the top of this restaurant experience was the attentive service that they provided. With every entrée, they explained every different parts. Changing
the grill that often needs to be replaced, and filling the side dish every now and then. This was a
complete all you can eat Korean barbecue experience that I craved for. I completely recommend this restaurant for your all you can eat experience.
As I mentioned, this was the second Korean barbecue restaurant of the valley as of recent. Manna and Gen Korean Barbecue, the two that are opened, have very different characteristics. I would prefer Manna because of the food, service, and ambiance that I have explained above."}
{"text":"Best Korean bbq in valley!!! Head waitress Helen is the best. Great service to match great food."}
{"text":"Quick service and large serving! Also good price. I love their beef bulgogi and chicken bulgogi. The marinating sauce was so tasty. I also like the steam egg and daikon wrap. We enjoy several types of meat and octopus."}
{"text":"Phoenix used to be an All-You-Can-Eat Korean BBQ desert (aka we didn't have any). Of all the AYCE korean BBQ places in Phoenix, Manna is the best one yet! Better than Gen BBQ or the others - the meat quality is way better and the side dishes are good too! All for $21.99 or $27.99 (for the premium meats).

One more thing - they have the vents that go directly above the grill so the place doesn't get smoky and you won't come out smelling like meat!"}
{"text":"Back to this place again because they never disappoint. They really got a high quality beef and that is the reason why I keep coming back. The tongue was excellent.. the short rib fillet was very tasty and juicy.."}
{"text":"I can't believe we have three new ayce bbq places all of a sudden in little ol Phoenix area now.  I have tried all three and each have their strengths And weaknesses.  Manna has good meat quality (although brisket was sliced too thick), the best soups that come with the meal, and second best side dishes of the three - best was Gangnam.  It has the highest drink prices but lowest meal prices.  The marinades are stronger here, both sweeter and spicier.  I think you can't really go wrong with all these places and we enjoyed our meal here and will return."}
{"text":"We had the Kalbi and Bulgogi. The bulgogi was the clear cut winner the thin steak was just too plain. The dipping sauce was good but I prefer soy sauce and sesame oil which was brought when asked for. Side dishes were good. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"This was my second kbbq in two weeks and it was equally on par foodwise with the newer Gen. While having a different atmosphere, the service speed and friendliness was on par with what I've experienced before with kbbq."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, however I felt the need to because of your server Sharon. I've been to Kbbq places but this location is my favorite. I've never seen an outstanding server who works so diligently as Sharon. As soon as my friends and I sat down, she came to us with a bright smile on her face, asked us what kind of drinks we wanted and our order. Knowing that the place was pretty busy as well as her, she managed to bring our orders quickly, answered our questions, and checked up on us if we needed anything. Sharon's hospitality is remarkable! She's a very great asset to your company!"}
{"text":"10/10 would recommend. Food was good, and service was even greater. Scarlett is a very nice hostess and helped us out a ton."}
{"text":"I love here so muchhh !!! The meat here is amazing,very flavorful. They marinated it so good. I specially love their Bulgogi and the galbi. They also have good spicy tofu soup and the side dishes. I highly recommend everyone to come here."}
{"text":"My first time here and it was excellent. A wide selection of cuts and good side dishes. My server Alex was kind and very helpful. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"**Updated Review**

Came back again and this time brought 3 more friends who haven't been. The service that we received was absolutely terrible. When the waiter would change our grill, they transfer whatever we are cooking onto the new grill. Each time they did this, they didn't care that our meat would literally splatter all over the table. Such a waste of food and they didn't even bother cleaning it up. Absolutely unacceptable that this happened 3 times on the same visit.

Do yourself a favor and try the other Korean bbq in town. 

----------------------------------------------------
Decided to try this yesterday and it definitely did not disappoint! We did the $21.99 all you can eat and we were seated pretty fast. Great side dishes and the quality of the meat is pretty good as well! The bulgogi and brisket was so delicious.

The only downside was the service. Since you get to order 3 items at a time, after our first initial order it was pretty difficult to catch the attention of one the servers to place our next 3 items. This continued for the rest of our lunch whether it may be requesting more side dishes and water. It wasn't terribly busy so I'm not sure if the place was just short staffed at the time when I came in. Other than that, I think the price point and the quality of food that you are getting is pretty worth it! I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"My wife surprised me with dinner here. This is the first time that we have eaten at an 'All You Can Eat' Korean restaurant. We arrived around 6:30 and the place was packed with at least 10 people waiting for tables. Since there were only two of us and the group of 3 were next, unfortunately, they were not there when their name was called. So we were seated within 8 minutes.
All the condiments and salads were really fresh and the meats were nicely marinated. We had to cook the meats ourselves which was no problem. The ribs took a little longer to cook. We have 2 hours to eat our meal which was no problem but could be if you have 6 or more people."}
{"text":"When in Mesa, you've got to hit up some of the best Asian restaurants in the city. 

We had just walked for about 3 hours, fueled mainly on trail mix, jerky, and Cheetos (okay, so the Cheetos were all me). So we weren't going to mess around when we got in here. Premium All You Can Eat was the way to go. And we certainly ate all we could, and then dessert on top of that. 

I was lucky enough to have two grill masters as dining companions this Sunday evening, so my friend and I sat back and watched the many plates of ordered meat get cooked in front of us: bulgogi, pork jowl, shrimp, rib eye, spicy samgyup sal, more bulgogi... we had more, but hell if I can remember it. 

The truth is, you don't need to be a grilling pro for this. It's so simple. Just toss your meat on there and flip. The servers come by often enough to check up on you. There's also a button on the wall for you to press if you're in desperate need of more bulgogi. The servers came by quite often to our table to turn up our fan and change out our hot plate. We had a great time. And all our food was so flavorful and delicious. I think the only thing we weren't completely sold on were the shrimp. Those got messy, removing the veins and shells.  

For sides, we requested bowls of rice, japchae (glass noodles), and soon dubu (tofu stew). Nothing to write home about with these, but they were just fine for sides. The tofu stew had a nice spice to it and had maybe oysters in it? Not bad. 

There's a time limit of 2 hours, and at about 1.5 hours, we were slowing down. After finishing off the last of what meat was left on the plates (can't let that go to waste... oof), we ordered two coffee ice cream macarons and one vanilla. The perfect ending."}
{"text":"First things first, I'm the realest, the wait for the table was not intolerable. However, my party and I came early before the \"rush\". When we got to our table, the banchan was already at the table which I really enjoyed. The servers are nice and work efficiently which is DOPE ON A ROPE if you know what I'm saying. The meat is very good quality and you can definitely taste the difference. The servers are always asking if you want more or if they can help which is DOPE ON A ROPE TIMES TWO. I truly believe the price justified the quality and taste of the food. They have this ponzu sauce...and OMG...it's heavenly with the meat. And the atmosphere is A-1. In addition, the bathroom is poppin' with that blastin' music...it was like a night club in there bro. Hashtag I would definitely go back for the food, service, and the bathroom."}
{"text":"My friend and I did the AYCE deal for dinner. Our server Justin was really nice and kept checking on us to get whatever we needed. They play really cool music here and the staff is relatively young. The inside has traditional Korean elements but it's still contemporary. I enjoyed the food but it didn't WOW me. I like the location since it's right next to Asians Market. Will come back if I'm ever in the Mesa area!"}
{"text":"After our Thai Foot Massage, my friend and I came here to eat. When your craving Asian food around 9pm yay Manna was still open. 

This place hit the spot. All you can eat which they bring the meat to you and you grill it in front of you. It was so good. The best which I never had before was a thinly sliced pickled Daikon and you put your sliced meat in and whatever fixings wrap it and eat it. It was the best!! They didn't have lettuce to wrap our food like some Korean places do back home in Hawaii. The daikon was a great replacement. 

We had the bulgogi, pork ribs, and a couple more the staff suggested. It was great and it definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Cameron was very helpful! The food was great and the servings were large. We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot for Korean BBQ! The service and ambience was amazing! One of the staff members Helen was a delight to work with and was extremely helpful. I highly recommend the brisket and the pork belly. Their assortment of sides was plentiful and they always had steaming hot rice ready whenever. I will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Good value will eat here again due to high quality service and food. Scarlett was a great hostess."}
{"text":"Manna BBQ fulfilled every kbbq craving I had during my stay in Arizona. The meat was fresh, the side dishes delicious, the service attentive and the fancy table vents just topped it off. I would definitely come here again - to enjoy both the meat and the soju. Scarlett is the best"}
{"text":"If this restaurant was in California, it would be a 3 star review.

Considering the options in AZ ... I would give this place a 4 with high expectations of it getting to 5 after they get their kinks sorted out.

As for the restaurant, it's a good size and clean.

The meat selection is comparable to other AYCE K-BBQ places and the prices are very reasonable for what you get.

Side dishes, though, could use some work.

Staffing is friendly and working hard to service their customers but they were short staffed during my visit with the 2 waitresses and a manager serving the front.

Manager did assure me, apologetically, that they were still working out their opening staffing needs and considered it a prority to resolve.

For newbies, K-BBQ can be intimidating and difficulties in communication can create misunderstandings.

Looking forward to many future visits here."}
{"text":"When you find out that there's a 2 hour wait for a table for late lunch at Gen, Manna BBQ does sound like manna from heaven!

I do a lot of comparisons to Gen BBQ in this review. If that's what you're looking for, read on!

The menu offers a premium and basic item set. The premium \"A1\" was $28.99 and the basic \"A2\" was $21.99. We went with the A2 since it was cheaper than Gen's price of $24.99 for weekend lunch. The selection of meats for both the A1 and A2 isn't as elaborate and they don't have as many marinades as Gen but it got the job done at satisfying my unlimited grilled meat cravings for the day. 

The portions seem to be larger here at Manna but the trade off was while service was still good, it wasn't as attentive as the service we received at Gen for ordering more items or for grill changes. But to be fair, they have a ton of staff at Gen vs. this smaller restaurant which only had 2 servers. Also, some the cuts of meat are thicker so it takes longer to cook. The grill seemed to heat up faster at Gen than at Manna and it also seemed easier to control the grill temperature at Gen so that your meat didn't burn (Or maybe I didn't notice any char on the grill at Gen due to the very frequent grill changes offered). 

The A2 item set includes 15 different meats and 6 non-meat items such as jap chae and steamed egg. Out of the 15 we indulged in 6 of them (Bulgolgi, chadol naegi/brisket, spicy chicken, spicy samgyup sal/spicy pork belly, LA YangNyum Galbi/LA marinated beef ribs, and spicy pork galbi). Out of all the meats I'd say my favorite was probably the bulgolgi. In general while they tasted good I found the marinade sauces pretty basic and a lot of them tasted similar (The marinades were either a sweet brownish bulgolgi or galbi sauce or a spicy reddish sauce it seemed like) vs. the more unique marinated meats at Gen. You can order up to 3 items at a time and your meal comes with plenty of banchan, rice and a large salad. 

The atmosphere is pleasant and there were a lot of nice booths to sit at. There was no wait at all to get seated.

Overall it was an enjoyable experience despite being our second choice for AYCE Korean BBQ and the price was slightly cheaper per person. Still.... while I liked the food and atmosphere here I'm still Jonesin' for some Gen!"}
{"text":"We came here as a party of 10 and were seated in the larger back room. Alex was very attentive and recommended great options for us. The food was amazing and the service was great! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"First time ever coming to Manna today and can I just say I'm very impressed. Alex was an amazing server. He checked up on us regularly to make sure we're doing good and he was very on top of his tasks. Food was incredible. The meat was indeed tender, tasty and super flavorful. The atmosphere of the place was also very friendly and I felt very welcomed. Overall, a great experience and would definitely come back and bring more people."}
{"text":"Great place! One of the best BBQ Korean places I've been to in this part of town, of which there's plenty to choose from. The bulgogi and spicy pork belly are excellent.

Props to Alex for his excellent service."}
{"text":"Used to go to Manna in San Diego and I'm so happy there's finally one near me! Highly recommend this place to anyone who likes KBBQ"}
{"text":"Great selection of food to put on the grill! Be ready to eat non stop. We always get the more expensive option as it allows us to enjoy the seafood dishes. The baby octopus may look scary but it's really tasty. The shrimp is always a must for us. The sparerib is a highlight as well."}
{"text":"Def best kbbq in Arizona. Meat quality and everything is way better than Gen and it's not as busy. Don't buy into the hype. Come here you won't regret it and you won't have to wait in line"}
{"text":"There has been a lot of Korean barbecues popping up in the Phoenix area but this is my favorite. Not only is it much cheaper than the other ones, I believe the quality of the beef is better than some of the other places. Scarlett was a fantastic hostess and took care of us like no other. This will be my regular go to place."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  Menna was recommended through Yelp.  I was a bit skeptical of \"all-you-can-eat\" type of restaurants because usually it means mass production with low quality.  Surprise! Surprise! Surprise!  Meat quality was very very good and the portion was also very generous!  My family loves KBBQ and we will go the distance to get it.  Manna BBQ really delivered!  We enjoyed very much our dinner!  Service was promote and attentive!  Price is very reasonable.  

This place is not very big and as new as it is, opened about two months, there was already  waiting time, about 20-30 minutes.  Just wait till next door opens this giant Korean grocery store, Asiana, in Nov.  I think the wait time could be longer!!!  They don't take reservations.

One little tip, the sitting arrangement cannot accommodate group over 6. 
We will definitely come back again SOON!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!  I love the selection of authentic Korean meats and that is all you can eat is top notch!  I will be back again with the family next time"}
{"text":"Im so excited that more n more of Korean BBQ places are popping up in Phoenix! Its been open for 6 weeks now and we finally get to try this place out. 

Its a friday night, so Its kinda crowded and seems like all the young kids are flocking here for some good grindz! Which is so nice to see and to tell you the truth Its so nice being amongs different ethnicities! 

We probably waited no more than 10-15 min - gave me and my kane some time to talk stories while we waited!

Customer service is da bomb, everybody is so nice even through the hectic rush. Alex/Sharon and the rest of the staff are on top of it- i love coming to a restaurant where everyone helps each other out - thats how it should be! 

The all you can eat is just simply amazing and tasty, Except for the baby octopus.. Lol! Couldnt acquire the taste! But, we ordered A1- which is everything and sooo cheap, only $28.00.. gosh, back home in Honolulu you'll be paying easy $50.00 for half of whst we ate... Lol

Ill be back .... loving mesa"}
{"text":"Each time a new Korean BBQ place opens up in AZ, we are there! Manna BBQ definitely has the best quality of meat. Hands down. (Btw loved that they offer steam egg here! It's a great side dish to have with all of your pan chan). I loved that it had that \"family owned\" restaurant feel. The music wasn't too loud like other places I've gone to, so you can actually hear what your dinner guests are saying and the tables were very large and open. We got sat down right away which was amazing, we've been to other places where you're waiting over 2 hours to sit down and by that point you're already ready to go somewhere else. The staff was all extremely friendly and attentive as well! :) we will absolutely be coming back and will recommend this place to all of our friends and family!"}
{"text":"Okay so I see a lot of reviews comparing this place to Gen.... well I like this place way better then Gen in Az. Definitely will be back Goutsal! Their meats had tons of flavor from the Bugolgi to Galbi. Also had the tofu stew. Staff was friendly very clean restaurant and yes I know it's new. It was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Came here around 8pm with my boyfriend and they were saying last call would be at 9pm so we put in many ordered before 9pm. We did the $21.99 AYCE option which has our essentials when it comes to KBBQ: brisket, Kalbi, pork belly, octopus, bulgolgi, steamed egg and tofu stew versus $27.99 for the premium stuff. I even liked all the sides: raddish strips, raddish slices, kimchee, cucumbers, fish cakes, potatoes and salads. I left full and really likes the salt dip with my briskets. Would definitely return. Service is fast and friendly - with a call button at your table if you need immediate assistance. Plentiful parking in the plaza lot too."}
{"text":"Service was ok. Tight on elbow room for groups. Meet was alright but nothing to write home about.  Dessert doesn't come with all you can eat buffet and you can't take home your left overs unless you pay extra for them"}
{"text":"Tristan is the best server ever! Very attentive and funny. He made sure we had enough meat, side dishes, rice. I'm will for sure be coming back here again. Make sure to request Tristan as your server you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food and pricing was great. But the Asian manager/host lady was incredibly rude numerous times to me and my friends throughout the night. They also told us we didn't need a reservation when we called in beforehand, then when we got there and told them we needed a table for 5, the first question she asked was \"do you have a reservation?\" They then made us wait about 20 minutes for a table. And SHE was the one who had the attitude. Seriously?
Then the hostess girl (I think she was Hispanic) didn't seem to know what she was doing and gave us wrong information. They have a poor way of treating people who are bringing them new customers. Made a terrible impression on my friends' first time there."}

Trying out All-You-Can Eat


Manna BBQ is just one of the few All-You-Can-Eat Korean BBQ joints popping up all over the valley since 2017-18.  Needless to say, this ones been around the block and PHX is just one of the few places this popular eatery has touchdown on!

Manna BBQ offers up 2 different prices points regarding how you want to order.  You have a choice of $28.99 or $21.99 and of course allotment of meats.  We settled for the $21.99 price since I feel sometimes that after eating for certain amounts of time; all the meat tend to taste the same.  

We started with your basic bulgogi meat and spicy meats along with some briskets.  I am happy to announce that the marinated meats and spice hit the spot.  I didn't even use my sauce for much.  Sweet, salty, and spicy with every bite, Manna definitely has their time of marination down.  Though I wasn't too impress with the brisket since it was pretty plain, but that's expected.  However, the sauce they serve on the side was pretty simple.  It was soy sauce and rice vinegar base with some sea salt...yah!  I guess that would be my complaint about the food; need some flare with the side sauce!  Also, the side appetizer dishes was a hit or miss; what ever happen to the fried mackerels!?  Anyways, that's not much  to complain about, but the sesame noodles and kimchi was a hit; I could do without the rest.

In the end, Manna BBQ did deliver some excellent Korean BBQ bites.  Service was fast; every time we ordered they came right out without wait.  The place was well ventilated, but I could definitely do with more lighting since that would have helped with the pictures plus allowing me to see how I'm cooking. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We now have 2 great korean bbq places in Phoenix: Gen BBQ and now.....MANNA BBQ!

This all you can eat korean joint originated from San Diego, and it tastes JUST like it's predecessor! The concept is the same as it's competitor Gen bbq, you have a list of meats and other sides to order from, and you try to stuff yourself to the brim!

There ARE some differences between Manna and Gen bbq, that I feel people should be aware of, and it COULD make up your mind on which one to go to. Here are some differences that I've noticed so far

PRICE
Yes, Manna is a tad bit more expensive. I believe it's $18 for lunch and $28 for dinner versus Gen which is $17 and $25. 

SIDE DISHES (ban chan)
Manna bbq gives WAY better side dishes, and yes, they have fish cakes!!!! 

MEAT QUALITY
Manna has better meat quality! The bulgogi is SOOOO good here and it's not cut up into weird slivers like at Gen. The brisket (cha dol) is better too here, it just tastes more flavorful! 

SELECTION
Gen definitely wins this! They have a HUGE selection to choose from, including Seafood! For me, I don't care about the Seafood options, but gen also provides things like korean fried chicken, and cheese pork cutlet! However Manna serves things like steamed egg and soondoobu that tastes wayyy better than Gen. 

SERVICE
Because Manna is less popular than Gen, their service is better. There is none of that \"only can order 4 things at a time\" rule, or they don't say anything about 2 hour maximum time limit which is nice. It DID take awhile for them to switch our grill out, but then afterwards they started to do it every so frequently. 

So all in all, Manna is different from Gen, as for which one is the best,  I haven't decided yet. 

Tips
-Ask for garlic and onions to grill. It'll add to the meal and flavor your meats 
-don't be afraid to ask for refills on your side dishes, the fish cakes, they'll be more than happy to get you more 
-ask for another pair of tongs, I think it's weird when there's only one person grilling the meats"}
{"text":"Great quality Korean bbq! Been waiting for something like this in Arizona for a long time. Food is awesome and portions are extremely generous. Favorites for the wife and I were the beef brisket and the ribs. The only complaint I have is the ventilation is not setup to well so It can get kind of Smokey. It won't really bother anyone except for the cook. Will be coming back to try the A-1 menu in the next week or so"}
{"text":"This new manna bbq place is in an old favorite golden canyon chinese... the meats selection is plenty and plenty fun. The galbi and bulgogi are easy goto.. the spicy chicken was super tender and spicy.. be adventurous ask for help and advice and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a super big fan a Korean bbq but enjoy it. We decided to go as a family to Manna. Count it eleven of us on a Saturday night. So we went at 5:30 without a reservation. Not a problem. We were seated fairly quickly in the back room where all the large tables are at. We got two tables and one huge one with two burners. Nice. 

They have two options on the menu. A1 and A2. A1 has more selections so of course we went for A1. 

One thing that I noticed is that the meats are much fresher than at Gen. Also, the meats are marinated. I thought that all the beef and chicken was really good. Fresh, marinated, and tender. Really good protein. We also got the octopus and these were not tiny but would say that they were medium sized. Really good. Just takes a little longer to cook. 

Only downfall I thought was the pork. Very thick piece and just didn't seem to be marinated like the beef and chicken. So wasn't a big fan of their pork. 

Our server was always on top of our tables. Asking if we wanted to order anything else and keeping our water cups filled. Even gave us a jug of water so we can refill. They also replaced our grill a few times each. Just have to ask. 

The cool thing I liked is that each burner had a retractable fan. So when there's lots of smoke just put the fan closer to the burner and you don't have to breathe all that smoke. Very nice. 

So I really liked this place a lot. Great food. Marinated food. Fresh food. Oh yea I didn't see any food straight from the freezer too. Great service and basically your ambiance is your burner cause all eyes are on the burner and your plate in front of you. Hahaha. 

After we finished, there was a huge line out the door waiting. So I would recommend you go early if you don't like to wait. Enjoy. We did."}
{"text":"Finally an AYCE KBBQ you don't have to wait hours for a table. There were about 20 tables inside and we got seated right away on a Saturday night. They only let you get 4 plates at time which is fine since the plates are pretty big. They still have some kinks work out, we had to ask for sesame oil 4 times and they gave us a mystery plate of meat that we didn't order. One of the waiters told us they were undergoing a menu change, because we ordered some items on the menu that they didn't actually have.  Overall, a pretty decent KBBQ for your money in AZ, the meat quality could be better though."}
{"text":"One of the decent AYCE Korean bbq in Phoenix.. I'm glad that more of these are popping up in Phoenix.. this place is a lot better then the Korean bbq couple miles down by Korean mart.. better quality of meat.. and I love that they have a call button like they do in Korea bc u just have to push a button when u need something and not waiting for the waitress to come and check on u whenever they have time.."}
{"text":"Left another Korean Bbq due to lack of service. Came to Manna and was greeted with a warm welcome. We were seated with Cameron who was amazing. He is very personable and patient. He will be the main reason i will return. The quality is outstanding and the service is at least 5x quicker than Gen BBQ. Do not go the the one on Dobson/Guadalupe- they are no where prepared to have the restaurant open."}
{"text":"Good lunch specials food, unlimited meat supply just for 17/person, really worth the price, much cheaper than most of  restaurants."}
{"text":"All you can eat Korean BBQ at a great price! 
Two sets of menus to choose from, but i Highly recommend \"A1\" if you want the good stuff.

Soups were amazing and I can't get enough of the pork bellies! Beef brisket will always be a great starter as well. Did I mention that it's all you can eat?"}
{"text":"A third Korean BBQ joint just miles away from the others! Yesterday was our first time here, and there was NO WAIT!!

If you've gone to Gen at Tempe Marketplace, you've waited about 2.5 hours to 3 hours to get seated, not this place. It's hidden in a plaza in the corner which used to be a great childhood Chinese restaurant that we used to come to! 

Now for the price, there are two different menus to choose from. A1 and A2. A1 is $28.99 and A2 is 21.99. We went with the A2 since it had most of our favorite meats. 

The meats are very good cuts. The portions are a lot bigger than Gen so because of how much you order at a time, they aren't skimpy at all. They also have the steam egg which is one of my favorites!! The downfall is that they do not have rice paper. 
Overall the staff was wonderful, we met the owner who was really nice and called out whenever the tables around him needed a grill change. 

The concept is very similar to Gen, the options on the menu are less than what Gen offers but overall I would say meat quality is better here."}
{"text":"?????????????????All you can eat ???????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Lunch selection was not as various as Gen but everything tasted good and authentic. Staff were very friendly and prompt. Loved the marinated pork rib and spicy pork belly the most."}
{"text":"For a first timer to this type of Korean BBQ I was enamored. The restaurant is set up very cozy. My waitress was warm and friendly and got me setup on how things worked. The accompanying dishes were great (I loved the glass noodles and the cilantro salad) it was a great dining experience and I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Love the food. Love the service. The price for 2hr all-you-can eat is a great value. We've been twice in one month and the only issue is the wait during prime evening dining."}
{"text":"Was starving for some authentic Korean and I was impressed by this new place! Best Korean food in Pheonix. 

-Great ambiance: inviting and clean with style, good music, and TVs galore!
-Service: Although it was busy, our waitress was welcoming and attentive. 
-Food: Many delicious Korean side dishes: kimchi, fishcake--my favorite. Meat was high quality and galbi was to die for.  Comes out in good portions so we knew how much to eat. 

Definitely coming back. Will check out their place in San Diego!"}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ in the Valley!  It was excellent, delicious and friendly. The hostess Scarlett was very welcoming."}
{"text":"Ok, Way better than my other spot on Guadalupe n something, where my Japanese buddy use to love to go.. ..

The Entry is kind of awkward, as there isn't a Hostess station, nor a sign to wait to be seated.. Wasn't long though before someone came and asked us if we wanted a seat,, We said yes, but they gave us a Menu to look it over before deciding, since its ALL YOU CAN EAT.. 

For the price, we got the cheaper version about 21 bucks each.. NO HAPPY Hour though,, 

We got Pork Belly, Baby Octopus, Beef Bulgogi, Beef Short Ribs, Spicy Pork Bulgogi and a few others,, forgot all the items,, but The Beef Bulgogi was prolly my favorite.. 

Wife loved, it,, they do provide various  sides, Kim Chee, Soups, etc also.. Ohh Beer 6.99 ,, ouch,, but rough week, so add that in.. 

Tables are nice sized, and the hotplate, is perfect temp, and after got quite messy form cooking, they swapped it out for a clean one, to start over, .. Very great Staff.. 

I do like they plop the first servings of meat on the hotplate for you.. but when we managing and flipping ourselves to our liking, sometimes they come right after n reflip everything and also used the scissors to chop most of the meats.. ehh, ask first if we would like some help,, .. Maybe cause I'm white, I need help on a grill.. lol,, anyways,,

Will be back,, The price was equivalent to 1 Dish at our other Korean joint, but here we got to meat out !!

Kudos.."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place - Excellent! Primarily our servers Sharon and Cameron. They were absolutely fantastic. Wonderful, amazing people that genuinely care. Even just talking to them as people was a pleasure. The decor and design of the place is cozy and awesome as well! I fully recommend trying this place out should you have the time and love super great service!"}
{"text":"Overall good experience.  Eat till your pants burst... Why not!! Even our rookie noobie enjoyed it fully.  Great staff. Cheerful, and funny. Oh, I love all the pregnant moments for cultural misunderstanding and how everyone can just laugh through it all.. Fun fun FUN!!"}
{"text":"First time trying AYCE Korean BBQ. Yes there is a wait but it's worth it! The meats were well marinated and tasted good. Sides were good. Just wish service was better. I know they're on the new side. But we had to order everything twice before we got it. One server wrote things down and that helped more than the one that tried to remember."}
{"text":"I'd say that I'm a frequent visitor of Korean BBQ both in Phoenix and Las Vegas and Manna BBQ is by far my favorite one yet! The quality of meat is far above most places. The prices are excellent for both the meat as well as alcohol (try the peach shoju!). The staff are also amazingly friendly and attentive, Alex and Cam took excellent care of us and we were never left waiting or looking for help."}
{"text":"Manna is my favorite Korean BBQ spot now, I don't go to Gen that often since their opening. I usually go with the AYCE plan with premium meats since the quality and meat varieties are so much better than the regular one. 

Food: They gave you beef tongues generously, unlike Gen only gave us a few slides every order. The meats are really fresh and marbling. 

Service: Good. We've been here for a few times and all of the servers were extremely nice, especially a Korean lady who are super helpful and nice.

Con: they don't offer drinks with refill. That's probably the only con I could think of.

Price: a little pricer that other places but I think it worths."}
{"text":"Korean BBQ isn't at the top of my list. But, their menu looked really interesting. I don't really enjoy paying to then do all of the cooking.

That said, Manna does a really good job. The place is clean, including the restroom. The people are friendly. 

The A1 menu is the way to go. I mean really. It's only a few $ more and you get the better cuts of meat. The portions are generous. And, even thought the \"all you can eat\" is limited to dine in (no taking leftovers without paying more) and for no longer than 2 hours, you'll get good value.

The rib eye is really good and easy to cook. The beef short ribs had great flavor. The spicy pork ribs weren't really spicy. They were good but hard to cook. The beef bulgogi had a wonderful flavor. I didn't like the brisket because it was about 50% fat. It's cut as thin as thin-sliced bacon. The shrimp were hard to deal with and too much work for the size. The egg was straight up weird and tasted like what air would taste like if it were an egg. For my taste, all of the meats except the rib eye had excessive amounts of fat still attached.

Refill service was lacking. The \"hot\" tea was more like \"warm\" tea. They had a sign upon entry advising they were out of the large intestine. Oh darn. I nearly turned on my heels. Kidding! The menus have items lined out rather than reprinting them - makes me think \"this place is authentic.\" Why waste perfectly good printed menus, right?

If you're into this kind of dining, I believe you'll be very happy with your experience here."}
{"text":"Went here after finding out Gen's wait was 2 hours. I have to say I'll be coming back here from now on! Got seated right away and the meat was better than what I've gotten at Gen in the past. All of the servers were very attentive! Alex was great and gave a lot of good recommendations. Oh, and the tables are bigger so more room for dishes which I like."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Our server, Scarlett was amazing and gave us fantastic service. All the meat tastes great and service was very good. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Im a Korean BBQ lover and this was a great find, my boyfriend and I went to Manna BBQ last week and this place has the best Korean meat ever!!!!! And it's ALL you can eat for a reasonable price! A Must!!!! Visit @yelgarieats for more food reviews :)"}
{"text":"Unless someone told you specifically where this place was, there really is no way you would even know this place existed. It's extremely tucked away in the corner of an empty plaza (You'll smell it before you see it) - but thank the lord no one knows about this place yet. Like others who have posted below, let them wait 2-4 hours at nearby Gen. This place is a silent weapon, just waiting to explode with ridiculous wait times when others learn about this place. 

Don't get me wrong, Gen is great, maybe even more superb to this place (especially the marinade and service) - but in terms of quelling the AYCE hunger, this place really does the trick without wasting precious time. I used to go to Cali or Vegas just to get AYCE in this barren desert and now they're suddenly popping up all over the place - it's mind-blowing! Here are some recommendations:

- It is extremely smoky in here. When I got here, the owner had the doors open to blow out the smoke. Their hoods aren't doing a great job so be prepared if you get teary eyed easily. Hopefully, they fix this soon.

- Get the A2 vs the A1. It's cheaper and honestly, has the meats most people want in an AYCE anyways. No point in paying more for - otherwise, I would recommend you go to Gen where they have the same options as A1 but cheaper. 

- Some portions are big, for a purpose. They tend to load up on the cheaper, fattier cuts like the bellies or brisket, to the point where it's almost 2-3x the portions of anywhere else. Actual meatier cuts like galbi and bulgogi are normal portions so you don't waste the good stuff. When ordering brisket or belly, ask for a half order or risk regret at trying to stuff yourself with filler fatty cuts.

- They have an actual private room in the back so if you have a large party, this would be a great place - a benefit over Gen.

- Service is currently still working out kinks, so you have to practice patience with this one for now.

- If you've got elderly in your party, I honestly probably think this place is a better option over Gen. Not as crowded, noisy, dark, with chairs they can actually sit and relax in. Just a different vibe is all."}
{"text":"Love love the quality of the meat at this place. Came here xmas eve for my moms bday n we got the b course. We got the la galbi, jumulok n chadol. I highly recommend the la galbi n jumulok. The quality of the beef was amazing. So tender and juicy, very little fat. Also w all you can eat I was surprised you can get as much as the egg steam and the soups. I tried both the soondubu and danjangJjigae. Both absolutely delicious!!! It seriously was worth the drive for me!! 

The interior is very clean, modern and has the newest technology of fans so you don't come out reeking of k bbq which is always a plus!!"}
{"text":"Yet again we had terrible service. I feel this time it was due to some slight racism. The server was female, she took and brought our first order. After that it's like she was completely ignoring us. He table behind and across from us were getting great service and she stopped by there tables several times.  She even passed by and looked straight at me several times. Every time I pressed the call button, it was always someone else who came by. Someone finally saw we weren't being tended to and they became our new server. We were at the resuraunt about 45 min longer then we planned. This is all because we were straight up ignored for that amount of time.  I'm giving it a higher score this time because our replacement server was excellent.  He had a beard with reddish hair."}
{"text":"Fairly good Korean bbq. I don't know what happened with their grill but it was either to strong or too weak.  Couldn't really make a good crispy pork belly. 

Management is friends and is a good place to eat some cheap and yummy bbq. 

It's a little loud but still lots of tvs and lots of tables!!!"}
{"text":"This place was sooo yummy!! It's the closest thing we have found to LA Korean BBQ, they are just missing the rice wraps. The food was fresh, service was nice and fast! Besides the price for one can of soda (2$) the price for the food was good. Our bill for 2 ACE 3 sodas was 53$. Only complaint was no rice papers, and soda price per can 2$. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"It was way overpriced with subpar service.  Staff seemed annoyed when you had to ask for items which makes no sense because it's setup for you to rely on the staff for your entire meal."}
{"text":"Overall: Definitely recommends this place. 
Food: Yum yum yum
Service: Outstanding
Other: this place is pretty popular, would recommend come early to get seats. Otherwise the wait maybe long. 

Food: AYCE KBBQ in 2 hour time limit. Everything was really good overall. My friends and I decided to order to A2 which contains the shorter list of items for ~$22/person. The flavors are pretty good. I love their tofu soup. It's the perfect spiciness for me. I did think their marinated meat were slightly a bit on the salty side for me. But still very good. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"LOVE this bbq. I've been to many Korean barbecues in this area and this is one of my favorites, the food is always amazing and it's all reasonably priced. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"It was only our waiter's second day on the floor! He was so amazing! Great service and great personality! I love everything about this. Atmosphere, food, vibes, and service all get 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here every week since they opened & sometimes twice in a week. 
I have to say the quality of meat is always the same & love the fact they have big & small intestine on the menu.
Was not a fan of it but it is sooooo delicious. The filling is full & with great flavor.
Miso soup & steam egg also is great. Not too salty or bland.
Service could be better (staff don't smile as much) & not very welcoming when you walk in but it's defunitely worth coming back for the food, especially with all the bbq places opening up, by far my #1 choice."}
{"text":"We tried the cheaper $21.99 all you can eat option and I thought it was an excellent value! We tried the bulgogi, galbi, and other types of meats that I don't remember the Korean names for. I liked that the meat was marinated, not just plain like at some other Korean places.  The japchae glass noodles were delicious too. There was nothing I tried that I didn't enjoy. The only thing I wish is that they refilled our sides and maybe had squid on the menu. I didn't try the tofu stew but my friend said it was good.

We came on a Sunday at noon and there was no wait! I would definitely come back again some time."}
{"text":"If you're very hungry and want lots and lots of meat, head on over to Manna bbq. They have variety and decent cuts of meat. It's all you can eat, so have some strategy before you start ordering. 

One thing I wish I'd known before coming here was portion sizes. I assumed it would be small portions per order (like other all you can eat places) so our strategy was to start from top and order one of everything skipping the ones we know we wouldn't like. Well, so much for that plan...we started with the first four. We didn't know they give you HUGE portion of cheaper cuts and tiny portion of expensive ones. One of the cheaper cuts, beef belly arrived piled high on a dinner plate. I was already feeling full after this one dish. Galbi arrived on a long rectangular plate taking up only one side. It was FOUR small pieces! Really? So, we were only able to order few more orders before throwing in the towel. 


Other than the portion sizes, I had no qualms about Manna. Service was fantastic and meats were fresh and tasty. Price is very reasonable. I'd love to go back and try other meat cuts we didn't get to last time."}
{"text":"When I barbecue, everyone loves to swallow my meat.  ;)

Five A1s please! 

Premium cuts, great quality, and some decent flavors. Some items were definitely on the blander side [the octopus] but other items were all about flavor. The portions here are ridiculously crazy on the thinner items like brisket and beef tongue which I don't mind one bit. I recommend coming in a group of at least four to get the most variety of items because with bigger portions, it's harder to sample everything they have to offer.  The quality was a lot better than I expected.  You could see the beautiful marbling on some of their cuts and it made me straight have heart eyes, emoji style.  Get the brisket, the beef tongue, the LA YangNyum Galbi, and the shrimp!  The banchan here could use some work.

4.5 stars easily but the service at Gen is much more efficient and I do like the bigger selection at Gen so for that, they'll be rounded down instead of up.  Regardless, if I wasn't willing to wait for two hours at Gen, I wouldn't be mad about coming to Manna instead!

{"text":"I had craved Korean BBQ for awhile now and my inability to really move right now is a good enough review, but I'll elaborate.

We were seated right away; we went about an hour before close. We were behind a partition and it made it a bit harder for the servers to see us, and that got a bi frustrating. We needed a server a little more often than they came but I think that was due to us being tucked into the corner. 

They have a plethora a Korean side dishes that kept things interesting while eating. We had the bolgolgi, some beef ribs, sweet pork, and spicy pork, and some more that we just pointed at and got. There was only one item we didn't like the taste of but I think that's what we get for ordering some random stuff. Deserts sadly do not come with the all you can eat, throw a man some Mochi!

I'd definitely say the place was worth it, but try to get a seat in the main isle you see when you come in. There is more traffic and you'll probably get better service."}
{"text":"This place is 100% ktown. No higher praise available."}
{"text":"Alex was our server and he provided a great service. Manna Kbbq is a great place to hangout and enjoy some good quality meat. 10 out of 10 will eat at again."}
{"text":"I never leave Yelp reviews but the service here was so great and it was the best part of my experience at Manna. The food was also really great and the serving sizes were much larger than expected. Didn't get to try the Soondubu but I guess that gives me a reason to come back"}
{"text":"Best ayce kbbq for sure! The quality of the meat is very noticeable! Flavorful and super tender. The side dishes were all tasty and the meats were so good! The service was really good and all the staff were helpful. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Nothing could prepare us for the truly BEST Korean BBQ we have ever had. Dish after dish of fresh cabbage, seaweed salad, cucumber salad, and kim chi. And then plate after luscious plate of beef, pork belly, steak, baby octopus, teriyaki, and more. Our party of six had our fill and then some. The flavor on the meat was terrific - so fresh and flavorful. The service here is spot on - so attentive and gracious. Can't wait to re-visit again!!!"}
{"text":"The beef tongue is great?
Meats here are very fresh, price is good
Scarlett was a great hostess"}
{"text":"Nope. Can't do it.  For starters, they don't have the rice paper.  The girl said there was a substitute for it and brought me pickled daikon.  Yeah...that was NOTHING similar to rice paper.  For one, it was pickled and another it's crunchy! That's a game changer for me.  The food was flavorless.  They ran out of a bunch of food which is annoying considering you're paying for AYCE but in this case it was AYCE when it's available.  I remember going to Manna back when we were in California and it was pretty good....here in Arizona it definitely isn't the same.  The seats and tables were sticky.  They stack their sauces on top of each other which I think is unsanitary as the bottom of the dish is now touching the sauce that I will be dipping my food into.  I just didn't feel clean being in there.  I'm sorry, Manna...I really wanted to like you because we need AYCE KBBQ here, but this one is off my list."}
{"text":"5 Stars for food.
5 Stars for service.

1 Star for being turned away at 8:30 PM because \"kitchen is already closed\" and even though all information on google and yelp and their front door say they close at 10PM and we made an hour drive to get there.

1 Star for being told when we went at 9 PM, we only had the option to order one time even though it's AYCE because their kitchens were closing.

It's awesome if you can get seated.  It's a hit or miss if you go later than 8PM.  I know they're fairly new but they should have this stuff sorted out by now and really honor their posted hours.  

If by chance this happens to you, don't fret because Phoenix is currently in a KBBQ boom and Gen Korean BBQ is very close to you at Tempe Marketplace.  I just prefer the brisket they have here; everything else is pretty much the same."}
{"text":"Newly opened Korean BBQ

Air hoods, TV, airhoods block the vison of the TV

Order 3 items at a time

Burner on the table kept going out

Waitress kept placing items on the wrong table.

Maybe because of being new, the kinks were not ironed out yet. 

If this is the same place from San Diego, then they have a long ways to go. Marination of flavor was lacking of a lot of the meats especially the Bulgogi"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and the food never disappoint. The food portion was generous and the service has always been great each time we were here. Their all you can eat prices are reasonable and I honestly do not see myself eating more than 2 hours (which is the maximum time you can order). Their side dishes need some work, tables are too closer together and their ventilation system definitely need to work better. However, I will put up with those shortcoming for their delicious good food and services. 

If you have never experience Korean BBQ before, I will highly recommend this place. The food is authentic just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Food is excellent.
Service is excellent.
Lots of good side dishes 
Price range is okay.
Tons of free parking."}
