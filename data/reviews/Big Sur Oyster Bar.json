{"text":"So i've been to south point about a hundred times now and have passed Big Sur Oyster Bar just as much. Until one day me and my cousins just decided to try it.. We order our food, and then when it arrives, delicious! Thats all I could think of while eating their oyster rockefeller and calamari! Those 2 I highly recommend. I look forward to coming back here soon and trying out their other dishes..   If you decide to try this place out and dont like the food, call me. I'll come and finish your plate for you!"}
{"text":"This is inside The Southpointe Hotel & Casino.  We sat at the bar and got excellent service. I ordered the Seafood Diavola... sauteed shrimp,scallops,lobster over linguine in a spicy tomato sauce....sooooo good! The portion was enough for two people. The Fish-n-Chips was Beer Battered Halibut and was delish, we watched them poor the beer from the tap into the batter. Definite MUST TRY !"}
{"text":"Honestly, I didn't expect much when the family suggested eating dinner here. C'mon, seafood restaurant just off the floor of the South Point casino, how good could this place be? Well actually, pretty darn good.   All I can remember is that we ate good...crab legs, cioppino, clams, oysters rockerfeller,  calamari, clam chowder, and a bunch of other goodies. Everything was really good, including the service. Prices weren't too shabby either.  Entire family left satisfied. As they saying goes, don't judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"Frozen seafood boiled and served. The service was good, but the food is below average with a way above average price tag."}
{"text":"If you like seafood this place is pretty good and very fresh.  I tried the clam chowder which was good and the gumbo was real tasteful and full of stuff.  Good place for a quick fresh meal."}
{"text":"I have been eating at the Big Sur Oyster Bar since 2007 and it is as good today as the first time I went there.   The Gold Seal oysters are always great, and the clam chowder is out of this world.   If you are a true seafood lover, you will not be disappointed.   The staff are always friendly and professional, and will do whatever they can to meet special requests.  A family environment in the middle of a great hotel destination.   Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I bowl at the South Point and have probably walked past this place 100 times.  Well I finally decided to eat there.  Started off with a bowl of new england clam chowder. I must say it was pretty good. Not to thick, not to runny and a good amount of clams.  Had the fish n chips, made with halibut (a flatfish of the genus Hippoglossus from the family of the right-eye flounders). AWESOME!!! Best that I've had since i was in Ventura years ago.  One of my friends had the pan fried oysters with pico de gallo and offered me one. It was good, but would not order myself.   Overall, the service was great and the food was great/good.   I will have to stop here a lil more often."}
{"text":"This one night, I had this HUGE craving for oysters so what did I do? Hopped straight on my iphone and yelped it! I think I typed in \"oyster bar\" near \"Las Vegas.\" Hmm, 4 stars? Not bad!   Here we go, on our way to Big Sur Oyster Bar. We arrive to Palace Station casino and we go on our way to look for the spot. I had imagined that it would be a sit down type of restaurant but it was a little more kick back then that. Hence the words oyster BAR. I would say about 8  seats total so on a busy day, you more than likely would have to wait a long.   Looking at the menu we weren't too sure to get but ended up getting the pan roast because it seemed pretty popular. Along with that we ordered the New England clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl, half dozen rockefeller oysters and a dozen fresh oysters with complimentary bread.   The pan roast (mixed seafood served with rice) took a while to make but the cool thing about it was that they make it right in front of your face. It took slightly longer because they had so many orders of it ahead of us considering the fact that there were only three cookers for pan roasts. Getting a little impatient while waiting, we just kept nibbling on the bread. The pan roast finally done and it was SO WORTH the wait. SO GOOD and so FILLING! We had to take home leftovers but it even tasted as good as good as it was first served.   Catch this spot on a not so busy day and you will be satisfied!"}
{"text":"great clam chowder, nice sized oysters that were so big i could barely add any tabasco and lemon to the shell without it dripping off. oysters rockefellers were good after i sprinkled crushed crackers on top, but i am biased because i've had pappadeaux rockefeller trio. def want to come back to try lobster grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"Oysters rockafeller was good, but $15 for a half dozen is pretty expensive for the true quality of it. The lobster grilled cheese was good too, and the ahi ceaser was decent, however the waitress recommend blackened, and we think it was to cover up the tuna's subpar quality. The server was really nice and attentive though! We got just about the experience as you would expect from a place in the middle of south point's casino room."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and was able to watch the cooks in action.  This is only the second oyster bar I have been to, the first being the Palace Station Oyster Bar, so I will use that as a reference.  Dozen raw oysters.  Dozen clams on a half shell.  I would say that the clams were better at Palace Station just for the fact that they were larger but the Oysters were better here.  I've had the  crab pan roast at both of these places and both are very good.   The difference between the two is, the Palace Station version is very rich and you can specify the heat level.  Big Sur's version is not as rich but you need to add your own hot sauce from the table.  Since it is not as rich, it has a more pronounce crab flavor.    I would definitely go here on my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Visited Jan. 31, 2011   My date & I were in the mood for some oysters after catching a movie at the South Point & she mentioned that Big Sur was pretty good. It was around 8ish & it was fairly busy. However, there was still plenty of seating, but we opted to sit at the bar.   After taking our seats, they immediately brought out some delicious bread & butter. I was so ready to devour it all!! I started with the Manhattan clam chowder. It was definitely good! Although, I could do without the giant cracker/wafer that they serve sticking out of the bowl. My date had the Boston clam chowder, which was pretty good, but not as good as mine ;) She also ordered the GIANT shrimp cocktail. No joke, those were some GIANT scrimps!! 3 to be exact. We also ordered calamari & a half dozen raw oysters. The calamari was ok, but I probably would not order it again. The oysters were great & about medium size.   The prices were ok I guess, about what you might expect for eating seafood at a casino. The service was pretty decent & the staff seemed friendly. I will definitely go back, for the Manhattan chowder & oysters alone. I definitely want to try the lobster grilled cheese next time!  Overall not a bad oyster bar."}
{"text":"Good seafood/ great customer service stays open late! You won't be disappointed.  Conveniently located in the south point hotel."}
{"text":"Today I was Shocked. The server asked if We wanted bread.   Couldn't believe it.   Why would they change a successful business Model?  Then my po boy sandwich was disgusting.  Fish tacos were Awful. No way!   I've had my share of oysters and the Po Boy was frozen Nasty Oysters.    Last.    Best friggin Steamed Oysters that I've had here in the US!"}
{"text":"Poor quality oysters and crab. Zero flavor in the crab legs. The meat was sort of brown... Oysters luke warm. Not a fan. Overpriced for the poor quality of seafood."}
{"text":"I got food poisoned after i had those oysters i was puking all the way to grand canyon all day the next day"}
{"text":"slow and terrible customer service + flavorless food = never again.  if the food was all there was to complain about i would've given this place 3 stars, but the customer service is just NONEXISTENT. A customer shouldn't have to nag at a waiter about their needs when the waiter can clearly multitask especially when the cash wrap is right in front of the customers face and this waiter walked back and forth 3 times and then disappeared a majority of the dinner without asking if my husband and i needed more drinks or if we were doing okay. It's not that difficult of a job plus we were one out of 5 groups of people (mostly singles or couples) eating there 4 hours before close."}
{"text":"We were a group of six and were seated pretty quickly. The prices such as $22 for fish and chips can be a little off putting. However, you do get pretty big portions of quality food. I had been craving oysters rockefeller for a very long time and these didn't disappoint. The peel and eat shrimp were just okay. Some of the shrimp were not deveined properly so we had to clean them ourselves. Shrimp was not very flavorful. Probably the only downside to our meal. The fish and chips were huge and tasty. The crab legs special was also good but at $28 you would think they would serve it with a side salad or rice. The crab cakes were nicely prepared and served with rice and a salad. Fish sliders and shrimp scampi were delicious. All in all everyone was happy with their meals. I was catching up with an old friend and her family and the server kept refilling our drinks after we had paid without pressuring us to leave which was pretty nice. Definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Here's the low down. Too burnt out to drive to palace station. Never again. It's edible but other than that. Won't recommend. Palace station oyster bar 10. This place 1."}
{"text":"Service was good. Clam chowders are delicious but oysters were a let down. They were different sizes and flavors. I also wouldn't order the crab legs.  They were pretty average. There is a dish (called roasted crab with sauce?) that is very good.  I would recommend that and the chowders."}
{"text":"I recently ate at Big Sur during off hour service, the food was a 6-7 out of 10, but the service was outstanding. I believe the person serving me was named Crystal, absolutely flawless service. Very friendly, not overbearing as can often be the case when you go to a restaurant during off hours. Food service was prompt, my server ( ?Crystal I think ?) was very courteous, respectful and quite on point. 5 star rating is for the service quality, otherwise overall experience would have been a 4 star."}
{"text":"First let me say that thier chowder is pretty darn good but that is about it. Had the calimari and the shrimp scampi. Calimari was not near as good as in the past and the scampi was absolutely horrific...not worth a revisit!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best New England Clam Chowder in town! The only draw back to this place is the fact that it sits in the middle of South Point Casino."}
{"text":"I go there just for the oysters. this place has a diner type feel to it the great service sometimes gets very busy. Overall great food. My oysters on the half shell was so fresh and delicious I'm wanting them now. Enjoy. It's located inside the South point Casino."}
{"text":"Come here withe boyfriend to have lunch.  Had a delicious bloody mary that came with an oyster :9  It was so delicious, I had me a second one.  For lunch, I ordered a cioppino with the diavolo sauce (because I like to eat spicy) with additional red chili flakes and Parmesan cheese (for the salt content).  It was hella tasty.  Boyfriend had the shrimp scampy and mannnnnn o man!  Those shrimp were juicy!  Lunch can be a little expensive depending on your tastes, but they do have lunch specials here.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because we were in the mood for seafood and we pass by it every time we go to Southpoint. Overall, the service was great. Main courses tasted fair. Shrimp cocktail was a joke. 3 tiny shrimp with what seemed like a tub of cocktail sauce when compared in size.   I'm glad I tried it, but compared to other seafood joints, this place did not keep my interest."}
{"text":"First time at Big Sur Oyster Bar, we are here for a National Bowling Tournament in South Point Hotel and Casino; while my husband was practicing, my daughter and I had lunch. We ordered the fried calamari, fish and chip, and 2 New England Chowder. The chowder was delicious. Did get a chance to take a picture of it because it was that good. The calamari was good as well; however, the fish and chip was excellent. The fish was soft and buttery, perfect that my 9-year-old did not complain while eating it (it is lent for us which means no red meat on Fridays for 40 days). She is a cheeseburger kind of kid. I would definitely eat here again just for the fish and clam chowder."}
{"text":"We had a great meal and our waiter Alfredo made great recommendation for supper he gets kudos. We sat at the counter and watched Angel work his magic cooking up our supper he to gets kudos. Oyster bar has 1/2specials 12 to 4 pm   Prices are great"}
{"text":"My wife and I stayed at the Southpoint Casino for a night in May. We had soup here as a snack after going to the strip for a May the 4th be with you party. The soup and service was so good here. So we decided to drive back down here to have one of there lunch specials. The specials were $7.95 for a couple of different choices. I decided on the fish slider's they were awesome!!! My wife also enjoyed her fish taco's. We would definitely come back here for another meal!"}
{"text":"Been here at least 4 times and have not been disappointed.  Prices are a bit high.  I think the best are the Pan Roasts but the clam pasta was excellent if a bit spicy which I don't mind but some might.  The crab cakes are decent size but seemed a bit bland to my taste, but it has been awhile since I have had crab cakes anywhere.  Mostly bar seating around the open kitchen with some tables as well.  Out in the open in the middle of the casino and has fairly late hours which is good."}
{"text":"One of the BEST seafood place i've ever been to.  I'm so happy i discovered this place one day when there was no place to go grab some food about 12 in the midnight. I was staying at our timeshare at the Grandview and was really hungry. Everything there was far from the strip, so we decided to pass across the street and ended up at South Point. And i'm telling you, i regret NOTHING!  There was not much on the menu. They gave us bread and butter which is alright. I didn't really expect getting those, i see that place more of a fast food bar than a restaurant kind of bar. It was an open bar, alongside the casino. The hostess and the employees are nice because when i asked them what to get, they were nice enough to describe everything on the menu.   I didn't know what to order first, so i ordered fried oysters for appetizer. It was really good! Crispy on the outside, and fresh and soft on the inside, fried to perfection! And then i saw this couple eating this stew with noodles and tomato-ey soup, loaded with seafood. It looked really good so i undoubtedly asked them and ordered the same thing. It was called CIOPINNO. It was a HUGE bowl! I mean, one bowl is good for two. I was with my aunt and she shared with me. We didn't even get to finish the whole thing! It's an authentic Italian dish, typically stew/ creamy soup with clams, shrimp, mussels, scallops and squid. For the size, i think it was really worth it. I just don't like the fact that i have to go all the way to Southeast pass the strip just to get it. I live by north side/downtown area and they don't have anything close to that."}
{"text":"I got the oysters, I didn't think anything was wrong with them, but my friend did. I ate about 8 of them and felt fine. I also had their crab....$26 for a lb of crab, already sliced down the middle so no having to crack anything...so good!"}
{"text":"Incredibly poor experience! I had two simple dishes, that were executed very poorly. The clam chowder, was under seasoned, and a complete puddle of mush. It was truly disappointed; due to reading great reviews about it i had perviously looked forward to it. Then the oysters Rockefeller, not only under seasoned as well but completely flavorless. The bar top server could careless about his job, never asked how the meal was. And passed up cashing my tab out 7 times; as he walked by staring at my credit card each time. But the real disappointment was the food. So bad that I decided to order my entree elsewhere. The total experience was enough to leave the casino entirely. Save your self the disappointment and money; you will find better food at a soup kitchen."}
{"text":"Visited Big Sur for dinner tonight.  We Had a chicken sandwich, cup of chowder, and green salad with vinaigrette dressing. We loved them all. Dressing had great flavor and mixed greens were very fresh. The sandwich was big and seasoning was good.   The service was great. No tables were available, we sat at counter. We really enjoyed that because we got to see the other dishes being made and served."}
{"text":"Great place to go for oysters! On the half shell shuck'd fresh right in front of you. Always great friendly service. Clam chowders are both awesome. Shrimp cocktail are huge and tasty. Ask for wasabi horseradish. Pan toast is decent (we like palace&sunset stations better). Oyster Rockefeller is tasty and fried oysters are great. The lobster grill cheese and steamed crab legs were disappointing and reason for 4 stars. Plenty of seating usually available. Good oyster spot!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with either the food or their service. Our server was not very friendly. I tried their Oyster Po Boy and it was very bland. I couldn't even taste the oysters in it. It only came with two small oysters. They were probably left in the fryer for too long. It also came with \"fresh\" chips but the ones I had were definitely not fresh. I came here with a friend and they served our food separately even though our server took our order at the same time. I wouldn't have minded it if she didn't have to wait too long. I love oysters so maybe I'll give them another chance next time I am inside the casino."}
{"text":"the half dozen fresh oysters and clam chowder are perfect for lunch.... I took a star away for pricing"}
{"text":"Both the Manhattan and NewEngland clam chowders were delicious! They have $7.95 lunch specials Monday thru Friday. I had the fish taco's they were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The oysters are delicious. Sweet and clean. I recommend to skip on the lobster grilled cheese. It was, as most people stated, bland.  The sourdough bread is yummy and the chips are homemade, but nothing to be excited about. The crab special is a MUST!!! I love that the crabs come already cut and mess free AND it's only $28 for 1 and a half pounds of deliciousness.   Oysters Rockefeller was yummy, but I prefer the Louisiana gold seal oysters (raw)  Next time we visit we are ordering the cioppino (the guy next to us ordered and it smelled amazing!!!) Overall a good price for the food. Service was meh, but our bartender made sure he checked up on us all the time. Kitchen staff seemed off getting the food out. All our food (appetizer included) came out at the same time.  The Bloody Mary oyster shooter was ok. Too much vodka for my taste.  The best part is that this place is open til 12am!!! That's awesome. We will for sure be coming back. And more than likely regulars at this place! Dive in. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Okay so my husband and I have been going to the South Point since 2006 and whenever we were craving our Oysters they were already closed. This trip we made it a point to try them out and we LOVE IT! The Oysters were so fresh and big. We just came by for a quick snack and it was Awesome! The service was wonderful all three times. We sat right at the bar and got service immediately and they were super busy each time. Our only complaint is when we asked for our stuff to go they declined. Each time we came by we wanted to just grab and go up to the room and they said they cannot give us raw Oysters to go...I understand, I guess.  Then my husband wanted to take the Clam Chowder to go but they didn't have anything to put it in. So now we know that this place is only sit down and that is it. Next trip we are gonna try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Consistent and efficient casino seafood bar.  Monday-Thursday,  noon to 4pm oysters and clams are half off. Both are very fresh,  I love the clams raw,  they are sweet and crunchy."}
{"text":"The food has gone really down hill. Order the lobster grilled cheese tasted like it was her cook on an old stove who's all around all the only redeeming qualities was the server very nice don't recommend you come here its too expensive for what you get"}
{"text":"Only been there once but I had the shrimp scampi and it was amazing. Service was very good by Beth, super attentive, everyone there seemed to know here too. That's a good waitress, when you work at a hotel restaurant and you have people coming and asking for you by name. Only reason I'm docking a star is because the Caesar salad was really bad. But I'll be back for the scampi and Beth!"}
{"text":"Where regular here :) I know that its overprice but i rather eat here than Red Lobster. Food is delicious try the clam soup with white wine & garlic the best and of course the crab legs :)"}
{"text":"Great service and food. The oysters are fresh and king crab legs never failed us."}
{"text":"They have a special menu, noon-4pm monday thru thursday (or friday, not sure). About 6 items to choose from at a reduced price. Also the oysters on the half shell are half off. One friend got a half dozen oysters for $8. One got the shrimp alfredo. Not a lot of food, but enough for $9. I got the fried oyster po boy for $10. It came with chips, and was big. I'd recommend it. Each of us got a roll as well. The only downer was the hostess/supervisor. she stands at the front desk, you'd think as a hostess but when we walked up, not a \"hello\", not a \"hi\", not a how are you... all she said was \"bar or table\". I said table and she pointed at an open table. Guess it would be too hard for her to smile. Also, she never smiled. So at the end, I went to pay. She is the one that you pay. Not a smile, not a pleasantry. I noticed at this time that her name tag (which was upside down) that she was a restaurant supervisor. A white lady, thin, black hair. Nothing but a scowl on her face. Too bad. I'm shocked really that our server was so upbeat and smiling as he has to deal with her all day. But the food and server were great. This was 9/26/16 at 12:05pm"}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here for lunch on 10/31/14. Our waitress was Norma and she was excellent! First, I recommend you really read the menu board. ONLY Monday - Thursday can you get the lunch for $7.95. Otherwise, it's nearly triple the price!   Beer is cheap! $4.00. We ordered the Oyster Rockefeller and it was good. You get 6 large baked oysters for $15. Next, we ordered the Combo Pan roasted shrimp and crab. It was good and hot. However, it doesn't come close to the pan roast at Ocean Trail in Scottsdale -- which is my No. 1 favorite. You will have to do a lot better to pass Ocean Trail. But overall, it was OK. Nothing remarkable; a bit pricey for what you get. Total tab for lunch was $73.00 without tip. That was with only 1 beer and 1 wine."}
{"text":"Gumbo was just as good as NOLA. Oysters were pretty fresh. Lobster grilled cheese awesome. Must go!"}
{"text":"Had a late night dinner here. Delicious! Hubby and I shared - the service (even though they were closing) was phenomenal. The guy behind the counter kept checking on us to make sure we were okay. We understood that they were closing and didn't want to bother them too much. We were grateful for a seat and a warm meal so close to midnight! Great place. Will definitely eat here next time we visit South Point!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The clam chowder was so good. I Was seriously impressed."}
{"text":"First time going here and I had no expectations--good thing because I would've been devastatingly let down.  I ordered a cup of New England Clam Chowder ($6) because it was a safe bet. When I dipped the complimentary bread roll (a 6/10 on my scale of bread roll) into the chowder, I was not surprised to find that it tasted like barely above average chowder. Not deeply disappointed nor overly amazed.  The rest is downhill... Starting off with Calamari ($13): unseasoned and oily, I couldn't even tell if any squid existed on the plate because of how much it was battered up. My dad ordered Gumbo ($24): cheap sausage and bluntly-cut rotissery chicken swimming in a puddle of bland soup *with a hint of lime.* And my brother got the Pan Roast ($26): a blend of too sweet tomato and seafood remains.   The meal was just ok. Except, the final bill was over $100! So it was more like highly NOT worth it."}
{"text":"I tried the Oyster shooter & their Fried Calamari...wow, sooo good!!!"}
{"text":"I mean, oysters rockefeller, lobster grilled cheese, clam chowder, an oyster bar... Hello!!  Our wait wasn't terribly long on a late Friday evening. Seating is preferrably bar side which still keeps you in the midst of all the casino action and in view of the action in the kitchen. Nex time, will try their broilers."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of the items on the menu here and they've all been pretty good - pan roasts, cioppino, pasta dishes, fish and chips, raw oysters, clam chowder.  Never been disappointed.  The only regrets I've had when leaving this restaurant are that I've overindulged.    A note for fish & chips aficionados: a while back I went on a search for the best fish & chips in town, and tried several places.  The place on Rainbow that has the gluten-free batter - theirs were soggy.  A highly recommended locals bar on South Ft Apache - theirs were ok, but a little too greasy.  This place was the best I found before I stopped my search (filled my fried food quota for the year).  Light and crispy, with decently firm fish, but not too greasy.  My benchmark is the halibut fish & chips at Cooks Seafood in Menlo Park, CA."}
{"text":"The Big Sur Oyster Bar in the South Point Casino is hit-or-miss depending on what you order and what time of day you order it. I've had the jumbotrons and nose or a five-star experience and I've had the lobster grilled cheese sandwich and that was a one-star experience. The service is hit-or-miss as well sometimes it's great sometimes It shotty so my consensus would be that this is a three star restaurant even though sometimes you can get five star food."}
{"text":"I simply love this place mainly for the clam chowder it is so delectably awesome  I found it on a stay here in South Point when I would stay at the hotel ......but now I come to town just to get the chowder I get to New England / white chowder it is creamy smooth melt-in-your-mouth flavor also the clams are not tough they are so tender you don't even have to chew them they are so good on top of that it is well seasoned nothing really overpowers the combination that the chef put in the ingredients to make this what I call dream chowder I had a chance to talk to the chef and I asked him how does he do it and he said its a family recipe his name is Jose....... And he said he makes 200 pounds every two days and they sell out faster than he can make the next batch  I hope they never fire him because a chowder will never be the same...... I've been coming back for 5 years now and it is the best! Best tip I can give you is sit back enjoy savor the flavor and relax.... Take your time and enjoy every delectable spoonful"}
{"text":"Oysters and beer! We enjoyed half a dozen clams and a dozen of oysters with beer. The food was delicious and fresh. It is an open, casino oyster bar/restaurant with minimal service. After we were done with our drinks the waitress never came by asking us if we need another drink or anything else for that matter. She took our order and that was that. So -1 star for minimal service, but the quality of the oysters makes up for the rest. It is not cheap but won't break your bank..I think around $20 for a dozen of oysters."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed in the pan roasts, but the crab cakes, fish and chips, and the crab avocado salad are as good as they get. Excellent service, and a seat at the counter is always nice. I enjoy watching the chefs ply their trades!"}
{"text":"I do believe that I have visited the Big Sur Oyster Bar on every Vegas trip for the past 8 or 9 years. Not ever writing a review until now, I have never thought about why I ALWAYS go there. Guess it could be the great food. Guess it could be the great service. Guess it could be the cool atmosphere. I guess, no, I know, its all of the above.  OK, lets start with the atmosphere. The restaurant is located inside the South Point Hotel next to the Garden Buffet and has al fresco style seating with an open \"bar\" where all the food is prepared (You can sit at the bar or on tables). I like this concept because you can people watch and it is open and airy.  Next is the service. The service is quite good, the waitstaff are attentive and efficient. Although, if you order certain alcoholic drinks, they have to leave the confines of the restaurant to get it from the casino bar.  Last is the best part of this place; the food. Big Sur rivals any coastal eatery as far as seafood goes and it's in the middle of the desert! My personal favorites and obvious must-haves are the Steamed Clams in White Wine and Garlic (more bread is a must for sopping up all that delicious broth! That, or a straw!), Fried Calamari with Marinara (Crisp and tender), New England Clam Chowder (nice and thick served with a 5\" cracker disc),   and the Seafood Diavolo/Cioppino (they're actually two separate dishes but quite similar in taste, one spicy and the other with more seafood types). Some other dishes that I have recently tried and added to my faves are the Louisiana Gold Seal Oysters (hopefully BP oil-free), Oysters Rockefeller, and the Beer Battered Shrimp and Scallops (crispy, savory goodness!). The 1 1/2 lbs. of Steamed King Crab Legs are pretty good too.  Prices to me are a scosche high, but if you have a players card with some credit on it, you can use it towards your tab which can ease the hit on the wallet. We always eat family style and walk outta there stuffed and satisfied, so its a decent value for us. Overall, a good way to get something quick to eat so you can get back to losing? all your money in the casino! I kid, South Point....relax!! Here's a plug to make up for that last remark: For a good time, stay at South Point Hotel and casino!!"}
{"text":"Total disappointment. I had high expectations of this place being similar to palace station oyster bar. Not even close. The calamari was ok but other that everything was bland. Pan roast, oysters Rockefeller, jambalaya.   Dinner for 2 was $100 after tip, so in addition to being crappy it was overpriced. Honestly I'd be let down even if I'd spent $20.   The server was nice and prompt though.   Needless to say, ill never return and I strongly suggest you look elsewhere."}
{"text":"There's a first for everything and Big Sur was my first oyster bar. It will definitely not be my last either!   With 30 minutes to closing, we ordered only a half dozen of their Louisiana Gold Seal Oysters, jumbo shrimp cocktail and a crab and shrimp pan roast.   The oysters were the best I've had in Vegas. They were plump and super cold. The jumbo shrimp cocktail is exactly that, J-U-M-B-O! They looked like they were on steroids. The order only comes with three but that's all you need. The pan roast was comforting. I loved the tomato butter sauce!   The cashier who took our order didn't seem to mind that we walked in so close to their closing time but when my others friends came 5 minutes til', she apologized that they couldn't order anymore because her system locks at midnight and her cooks were already working overtime. Bummer! At least she let them sit at the bar to eat any of our leftovers.   Oyster bars are now on the list of places to eat at when I go back to Vegas. Big Sur was definitely a good introduction to an oyster bar. It motivates me to try others so I can have something to compare it to which will help me determine my favorite one."}
{"text":"My gf lives around the corner so we come in monthly to get the same two things every time, the cioppino and seafood diavola. Why you ask, because it's flipping amazing. If you read reviews and decide to go try one or both, you will not be disappointed, trust. We are picky when it comes to seafood, must be fresh and prepared well. These are the two most expensive items on the menu so try splitting with someone if you're not sure.  You'll be back!!"}
{"text":"The first place we eat at when we get to Southpoint every year. The best service and the freshest seafood you can get when away from the East Coast. I have had almost everything on their menu and nothing disappoints. Had the crab legs this time and there were so many I could hardly eat them all !"}
{"text":"The Oysters were the BEST we've had in Vegas!    The Pan Roast was mediocre and the clam chowder was warm, not hot.  We're just glad the oysters were on point and the service was good!    We'll definitely be back for a late night snack getting in or out of Vegas, when we have the itch to PLAY!"}
{"text":"Is it sad that some of the better seafood meals I've had were in Vegas?  Where dose this town in the middle of the desert find so much quality seafood?  I know most will probably say the Los Angeles / San Diego area, but there has to be a secret hatchery near Vegas where they add a little bit of crack to keep people coming back for more.  Anyways, New England Clam Chowder and Oysters here rocked.  I think the soft shell crabs are on roids since they were abnormally huge but still tasty.  check it out."}
{"text":"I LOVE it here and don't know why I never tried it sooner.    It's located in the Southpoint Casino, right smack dab in the middle...  and I really can't believe I didn't try it sooner!    Let's see... This place is pricy, and when we came in my eyes were definitely hungrier than I really was, but I am glad that I didn't follow through with wanting and NEEDING to try everything.   So we started with the calamari as an appetizer which was fresh and amazing... Crispy & not to salty.  It wasn't oily at all either & that's ALWAYs good.  Husband's orders first because it will probably be what I'm having this weekend. He had the Pan Roast which is excellent!  Crab, Shrimp or Combination. Served with Wild Rice and Tomato Butter Sauce.  The sauce is so freaking good it's crazy.  The seafood totally compliments the sauce...   And now for my boring order:  Fish & Chips... Which is good... But better with the pan roast!    I really like here & will definitely try other things that will compliment my pan roast. :P  Service is great... And the two times ive been there we were seated quickly.  if all the tables are filled up, take a seat at the counter!"}
{"text":"I was seated promptly at the bar.  We ordered oysters Florentine, Crab cakes and a seafood pasta dish. Waitress was pleasant, food was delicious."}
{"text":"When I visit my sister or hang out with girlfriends, we get a chance to go out for things our boyfriends refuse to partake in. In this case, for my sister, that meant leaving the guys at the craps table for an oyster break (her boyfriend hates oysters so she can't remember the last time she had them).   We were promptly seated and immediately given bread and water. The bread was great- warm and toasty with the butter packets wrapped up so that it was nice and soft and super spreadable (small detail, I know, but one that is so often overlooked that it's noticeable when done right).   The promptness and attentiveness of the service remained consistent for the duration of our visit.   We ordered oysters in two forms- straight up and Rockefeller. The Oysters Rockefeller were rich and buttery, basically tasted like a cheesy spinach dip on top of an oyster. However, nothing beats the real, straight up deal. The oysters tasted really fresh and clean and elevated by the horseradish and cocktail sauce.   We found $15 for a dozen to be a great value, especially considering that a half dozen goes for $13 (translation: don't order the half dozen and shell out the extra two bucks!)  We plan to go back for more oysters and for some crabs (there's a special for 1 1/2 pounds of legs for $16.99).   That's some good and fresh seafood feasting at friendly prices."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located within the South Point Hotel & Casino Resort. Eh, not bad, but I do have to say that nothing in this hotel should be this expensive.  There's not a whole lot of seating. Just a few tables, and the rest is counter seating. And for some reason, when I went, several people asked about to-go orders and it turns out they do not. Food is nothing spectacular at all. Definitely doesn't justify the price. But I guess if you want to have something different and you're inside this resort, give it a try."}
{"text":"I was happy with the fact bottles of wine are sold here for a decent price. So many times wine has such an awful markup. The food is good here. Try the fish and chips. It was definitely the best thing on our table. We had to return their linguini and clams. It didn't taste like any I had before and the sauce was thick with roux. It was just plain bad.   We had great service from Elizabeth.  She was a big part of us enjoying our meal."}
{"text":"Pan roast and linguini with clams were very bland. They give you 6 clams and 3-4 pieces of shrimp in each dish and barely any flavor. Won't be going back here!"}
{"text":"This is an over priced Oyster Bar. Too little amount for high price. The Oyster Bar at the Palace Station is my better. The food taste much better too. I came here only because I live 2 blocks away and I don't want to wait in line at the Palace Station. The Gumbo taste funny. The Pan Roast doesn't taste anything like Pan Roast supposed to be. New England Clam Chowder is yellow. I wanted to order Alaskan Clam Chowder but no way. It doesn't have it. Why calls it Oyster Bar? $8 for the lunch special which is baloney. Fried oyster sandwich is no good. Shrimp linguini is ok. It is not my thing.  The dozen oyster was good but I think it was $28. SUCKS!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I were hoping that the Garden buffet was open late but it wasn't. So we checked out all the other restaurants at South Point... some were closed and some were just way too expensive. We decided to eat at Big Sur Oyster Bar. Plus, it was poppin'!  I got the Linguini and Clams. Let me tell you, this dish is all kinds of amazing. I was quite pleased.  My cousin got the fish and chips. He ate fish and chips at 3 different locations in Vegas... and he said that the one at Big Sur was the best.  Service was nice and friendly. Food was awesome. Total food coma."}
{"text":"Palace Station was our go-to place for oysters every time we come to Vegas (note the key word \"was\"). But after our most recent visit to the Big Sur Oyster Bar in the South Point Casino floor, I think we may have a new go-to place that has less of a wait and great happy hour prices.   To start things off, Beth was our amazing server/waitress - very attentive and quick.   HH is Mon-Thurs 12-4pm where the oysters are 1/2 off! They have Louisiana Gold Seal Oysters at normally $24/dozen. At HH, $1 per oyster is not a bad deal and they were plump and fresh.   I also tried the cup of New England clam chowder, which was creamy and flavorful.   For my entree I got the Fresh Ahi Tuna Wrap served seared with wasabi mayonnaise. The wasabi mayonnaise made the dish. I would try the blackened ahi tuna next time as the seared one I tried was a bit bland. I asked for French fries with mine - their French fries are really good!  Everything including a couple beers with tip and tax was $53 - not bad. Will most definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I have to honestly say that I was really surprised at this place. I mean, it isn't much to look at. It sits on the main walkway inside SouthPointe. There are only a few tables and of course, a bar.  We were seated at a table so we could conversate. The menu has something for everyone, however; for an oyster bar, I didn't see many oysters on the menu. There were muscles, clams, shrimp, etc., but only one kind of oyster. Beer and wine is served here, but if you want something else, your server will go to the casino bar and get it for you.   Our server was amazing. Unfortunately, I did not get here name. She was very, very organized. All I can tell you is she was an older lady with dark hair. Since I wasn't that hungry, I opted for a cup of clam chowder and Ceviche for my main dish. One of my friends ordered the Ahi Tuna wrap and the other ordered the seafood platter. My clam chowder was really good. Nice an creamy, but not overly clammy. The Ceviche comes in a martini glass. It was not overly filling, but still flavorful. You have to dig to the bottom of the glass to get to the good stuff. (i.e. the avocado) My only complaint is that there were no chips to scoop up all the good stuff. The Ahi Tuna wrap looked good. It was huge. I think you are given a whole tuna. lol The seafood platter looked good as well. It came with two oysters, two prawns, a crab claw, and some clams.   If you want a good quick meal, then the Big Sur Oyster Bar is a good choice. Don't let the look and location fool you. It was a really good place to people watch. Especially, since there was an archery competition being held at SouthPointe that weekend. lol"}
{"text":"Sample appetizer over priced ~ service was very good and New England Clam chowder was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Mediocre food. Too expensive. Never coming here again, palace station oyster bar shits on this."}
{"text":"The Big Sur Oyster Bar is located inside the South Point Hotel and Casino, just a 10 minute drive from the Strip.  We started off with the New England Clam Chowder which was really nice and hearthy; with big chunks of potatos and clams.  Next, We had the Louisiana Oysters.  These suckers were plump, juicy and flavorful.  We gave them a nice soaking of lemon juice, a dab of horseradish and cocktail sauce.    **Warning**  The waitress warned us not to go too crazy with the horseradish because it packs a punch.  And she wasn't kidding.  My buddy Alan was the first victim.  He had a nice big chunk of horseradish work his head over. Alan grimaced like he just sucked down a 64oz Big Gulp in 5 seconds.  I was the next, as I caught a chunk hitting directly at the back of my throat, sending a nice burning shot to my face.  No, i'm not crying...  Man, that was some good stuff.  I had to mix in some of that stuff into the chowder.  Lastly, we had the Soft Shelled Crab Po Boy.  And that sandwich did not disappoint.  The soft shelled crab was big and meaty.  Plus the batter crust was awesome.  I could of downed a few of these bad boys alone, without the rest of the sandwich.  We got to sit at the bar area, so we watched the chefs working away right in front of us.  Most of the stuff looked really good.  We saw them cook up a couple batches of Oyster Rockafellers.  Oh man, we should of got some of those.  For sure next time!!  Great food at decent prices.  Time for some poker."}
{"text":"All I can say it is the worst pan roast in Vegas!  If you are looking for the real deal, go to the Oyster Bar at Palace Station!"}
{"text":"The best crab cocktail in town,nice lump crab meat,great sauce,yum."}
{"text":"Hands down the best oyster Rockefeller we have ever had. The crab legs were phenomenal lots of meat and already sliced in half. We went back a second time during our trip to Vegas. It's THAT good. I can't believe there isn't a 2 hour wait at this place!! The staff was just as excellent as the food they went above and beyond during both of our visits. In particular, the first night we went they did not have desert at that specific Resturant in the casino.. okay fine. Well we ordered since it was my boyfriends birthday what do you know the server comes back with a delicious slice of chocolate cake from the buffet restaurant in the casino. Talk about going above and beyond! This will be the first place we come back toe at in Vegas! So impressed!"}
{"text":"I love crab legs and theirs are good and already crack and ready to eat. I had a few glasses of Kendal Jackson"}
{"text":"Ive gone to the palace station oyster bar and this place is not as good but still pretty tasty. The portions were a lot smaller than I expected. I don't eat a whole lot so I wish I was able to take my chowder to go, but they don't have to go containers. Service is good. I'd go there again. But if I was closer to the palace I would go there instead!"}
{"text":"Great clam chowder! Big portions. Cookie the waitress is awesome! Busy on weekend nights. It can get a little warm in the bar due to all the open air cooking so close, but the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Always a great meal here! I love seafood! The cioppino and the crab legs are my most favorite and have it almost every time. The staff is always so helpful, sweet and so accommodating. Perfect place for fast but great food."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. My waitress was very nice and attentive. England clam chowder is all right; I've had better. Oysters were good, but I wish they had more sauce options on the platter. They only have Louisiana oysters. Being from CA, I'm used to having more options. Come for happy hour Mon-Thurs 12-4!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here it's a hit! Usually get the Caesar salad with grilled shrimp and a half dozen oysters with an ice cold Corona. Mon~Thurs 12 to 4 happy hour."}
{"text":"How it's even remotely possible this place doesn't have five stars is beyond me, I've eaten here at least a dozen times and every single time the food Was perfect, and the service was impeccable. The clam chowder is delicious, the shrimp cocktail is food of the gods and the wine selection is perfect. If I could eat here everyday I would."}
{"text":"Louisiana Gold Seal Oysters is a must - delicious and very fresh!  The french fries that comes with the King Crab sandwich is a great compliment to the sandwich."}
{"text":"Negative stars for this place. I should've known from a crappy experience I had there the last time I went. Went to fulfill my pregnant craving of clam chowder thought id give it another try. I wanted to buy a bowl of clam chowder to take home. The girl says no mamasita we don't have bowls to put it in. Really????? That all you got for me? Now even an attempt to find me an alternative? So I drove here for nothing???There's so many restaurants in this place one of them must have bowls to share with this restaurant right??????? Very disappointed. Tell management to get some damn to go plates and bowls for customers who want to order take out. Just a thought."}
{"text":"This is our second times at Big Sur! Here are my recommendations:  the raw oysters are a must, the New English Clams Chowder is high recommended, order the fresh catch of the day, and the crab cakes.  The waiters and servers are friendly and attentive.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Oysters were fresh, ciopino was awesome and large enough for two. Kinda weird eating in a smoke filled, noisy environment right on the casino floor. The quality of the meal definitely outweighed the awkward dining area"}
{"text":"I  as greeted and seated right away and service was amazing. I will definitely one backroad enjoy some items off of the menu! The fried oysters were just okay. I wasn't over the top impressed but it was good and did the job of satisfying my hungry belly! The prices were on the high side to me for a diner like atmosphere."}
{"text":"Lobster grilled cheese explains itself & their clam chowder is my fav so far!!! It's kind of a far drive for us, but well worth it*;-)"}
{"text":"Came here before a comedy show in the showroom.  It was busy but not packed.  We sat at the bar without a wait.  We were seated for quite awhile without any greeting.  Another couple was seated next to us and the server greeted them and took their order before even acknowledging us.  One of the cooks noticed we were getting irritated and took our drink order.  Finally our waitress came to take our food order and then another customer down the bar yelled for a Dr Pepper so then she left us to get him a refill.  Finally we got to order. I got a cup of clam chowder and combination pan roast and hubby got shrimp scampi.  They brought us the bill before we got our food.  Clam chowder was good but nothing special.  Combo pan roast was a little plain compared to my usual spot.  They didn't ask a spice level like I am used to.  Hubby enjoyed his shrimp scampi. Our drinks were never refilled.  They sat empty most of the meal.  I can see why the guy was yelling down the bar.  No one checked on us once.  Between service and food I'd pass on this place."}
{"text":"When craving seafood this is our go to place. Better yet, its easy to get in and out and its affordable.  We usually start with the Oysters Rockefeller. Made the classic way, six juicy oysters topped with spinach and cheese and perfect with a squeeze of lemon.  We usually then spilt the Cioppino however this time we decided to try the Pan Roast and add lobster. The pieces of seafood were cooked perfectly, the sauce was thick and rich. I'm glad we split it, because it is way too much for one. Along with a few beers, you can't beat it, and the service is great too.  The only downfall, which you can't prevent, is if you sit at a table, someone in the casino will walk by smoking. Try sitting at the bar if you can."}
{"text":"New England clam chowder was good.  Oysters Rockefeller average with tiny tiny oysters.  Also, had the Jambalaya.  Chicken tasted processed.  Sausage was undercooked.  Shrimp was good.  Sauce didn't taste fresh.  Very overpriced especially since you have to listen to the casino noise.  Try the Cafe Coronado instead if you really need to eat at South Point."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a snack.  While the lunch specials look moderately priced, dinner for this type of place appears to be on the high end.  Shrimp cocktail is $17, six oysters are $14, and $17 for oysters Rockefeller.  Staff members are kind, but location was understaffed at time period with long waits for service with wait staff hustling.  I tried oysters Rockefeller and I don't recommend.  It was soupy, lacked the rich flavor expected, and the oysters were chewy like gum.  I tried to get through 3, but quality was so poor I didn't want to waste the calories.    Salad and soups look good from afar.  Lobster roll doesn't appear to be worth $19."}
{"text":"First time here, nothing like the other oyster bar in town. But it wasn't bad. I had the Lobster Pan Roast, it was more on the sour side rather than a sweet and no spice level was asked for the dish. Service was great, they were prompted and friendly. Got everything we needed to have an enjoyable meal.  Coming back and trying other items on the menu,"}
{"text":"I had the gumbo here which I would not recommend. Also, I cringe a little when I see the oysters are pre-shucked and sitting on ice. They do have a nice 1 1/2 pound crab leg special for $16 and change, which.. is about the average price on the menu so probably should have gone with that. My wife had a seared tuna ceasar and it was made well."}
{"text":"late last year my husband took me to taste their shrimp scampi and oysters,  ummmmm sooooooo good..."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant in the heart of the South Point Hotel & Casino. Oysters a nice and fresh... The lobster grilled cheese is awesome. Crab cakes are a little below par but the New England Clam Chowder is fantastic. Not bad for Vegas seafood"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy the food here and loved to come here as a local. My husband and I always take visiting relatives here, especially when we encourage them to stay at the South Point Hotel. I usually get the Seafood Diavolo, and always the calamari appetizer. Unfortunately, after my experience last night, I will never be back. I have tried almost everything on the menu, and the only thing that was subpar was the crab and avocado salad. Last night, my mom (who is visiting from California) and I met my aunt and uncle and cousin from Hawaii here since they are staying at the hotel. I told them they had to try it because it was surprisingly delicious. I ordered calamari for the table, which was extremely rubbery in texture. I was the only one eating it after everyone tried a piece. My mom had some clam chowder which was obviously decent. We decided to share the TWENTY-SIX dollar lobster grilled cheese. It was nothing close to a grilled cheese. The bottom piece of bread was so soggy, the inside contents of the \"grilled cheese\" seemed to have little or no cheese, and it tasted awful. I honestly do not believe that there was any real lobster inside. For the side, it came with stale kettle chips that seem to be house made...maybe earlier in the week? My cousin ordered the crab for $29 which came out barely warm, with an unlit candle for the butter sauce. My aunt had fish and chips which also came out hardly warm fries, and luckily the fish was hot. My uncle had the scampi and he said it was good. Our service was nothing special and we never received any refills. The calamari came out so late that it wasn't really considered an appetizer. I felt bad that my aunt and uncle insisted on picking up the bill, but I was more so embarrassed that I had told them to try this place more than once, and the quality of the food and service was pretty awful. I am very disappointed. I feel bad for people who stay here and decide to \"splurge\" on a decent meal, since the prices aren't very reasonable. I still am in shock that the grilled cheese was so bad and came with stale kettle chips for almost $30. It should be removed from the menu ASAP."}
{"text":"I also  come to this  restaurant  whenever I'm Vegas. This restaurant is located in the South Point Hotel. I like their gumbo . The crab legs is good. I also like how they cook the food in front of you. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Good fresh seafood. Broad selection - they'll make it right in front of you. I had the oyster po boy and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"I've been coming here with my Vegas friends since 2008.  The oyster bar is inside the South Point Hotel &  Casino. Locals love  hanging out at this hotel and I love it too. It's huge, and bright  as you walk through the casino. We all get together and feast on fresh oysters, crab meat served in a martini glass and crispy calamari.   For entrees everyone's favorite dish is the Seafood Diavolo, a combination of shrimp, scallops and lobster served in a spicy sauce. And for those that don't care for spicy food like me, I prefer the cioppino, a combination of shellfish, fish, calamari with a little bit of linguini in a light tomato broth although nothing beats the cioppino at the Fisherman's wharf in San Francisco. The Pan Roast is another favorite if you love rice with seafood. You can order cocktails and beer and the waiter orders it from the casino bar.  Pricey menu  but they serve good portions. I gave it a 4 star for consistency in flavor, taste, fresh seafood, fast service, and the location  of the oyster bar. You see  all the casino activities and traffic. It's quite festive.   There's not a lot of tables  but the bar  is an option. There's always a wait especially at dinner time on Fridays and the rest of the weekend. I would love to give it a 5 star if there is that one special and amazing dish on the menu. Everything they serve is good and the seafood is always fresh.  I still consider this place a favorite hang out. Maybe this oyster bar deserves a 5 star. You'll be the judge."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting!!!!! Order friend calamari for an app. Wow! Heavily battered and wayyyyy over cooked. My husband got the crab leg special ( 1 1/2lbs of king  crab legs $28) they were over cooked, cold and extremely tough! I ordered the seafood diavolo and it was also nasty! Over cooked shrimp and under cooked scallops. Yuck. And in top of it all the service was horrible!!!!!!! Complained to our waiter and never came back.... Just handed us the check with everything full priced. All we asked were to take off the crab legs. What a joke!!!! Never again! Stay away!!"}
{"text":"Hostess could be more friendly, we stood there for awhile she never acknowledged us, until a server saw us and acknowledged us and made sure somebody cleared a couple of spots at the bar, it seem busy but people were more worried about their breaks. Lorena was very nice, and friendly. Food was  really good. The 3 stars really because of the hostess. We went tonight 7/1"}
{"text":"Overpriced, but good food in general. Nothing to write home about, but a good selection of items.   I had Grilled Chicken Monterey sandwich, the chicken was large, but the bun was dry and uninteresting. The chips were pretty good.   Service was fine too. Probably won't go there again."}
{"text":"I am so upset that I'm writing this in the wee hours of Christmas Day.    My fiance and I decided to grab some appetizers here before watching a movie.  I ordered a calamari and dozen oysters.  This was exactly what I said: calamari and a dozen oyster.  We got our calamari first.  It was good.  However, we then got fried oysters.  We immediately turned away and said that we did not order fried oyster since we ordered dozen oysters.  The kitchen staff said that it says fried oysters on our order but took back the order and will put in the order for the dozen oysters (FYI - we did not even let the kitchen staff leave the plate of fried oysters with us so we never touched it).  Michael, our waiter, came to us and said that we ordered fried oysters.  He wrote down calamari and fried oysters.  I clarified that I said dozen oyster.  I don't think that I would mistake saying dozen oysters with fried oysters.  Michael then went away.  After some time, Michael came back with the hostess.  She tells us that she can't remove the charge for the fried oysters since we ordered it.   Umm, are you serious?  We started to argue that we did not order fried oysters at all. My fiance argued that it doesn't even say in menu that the fried oysters come in dozen.  The menu lists those food as the following (there was no description):  Pan-Fried Oysters with Pico de Gallo  Louisiana Gold Seal Oysters  Half Dozen Dozen  Well, the hostess snapped at my fiance to not raise his voice.  Umm, hellooo!  You are the one who started the scene by basically accusing us of ordering the wrong thing or something.  It was just so ridiculous.  Luckily, two female kitchen staff members jumped in the conversation.  They told us not to worry that we will not be charged for the fried oysters.  However, we then told them that the hostess is actually saying that we do have to pay for it.  They said that's not right and that we should not have to pay for it.  They went to talk to the chef.  He went to the hostess and cleared it up with her to remove the charge.  I really appreciate those ladies and wished that I got their names.  They kept on telling us that we are right and that they apologized.  The hostess and Michael never apologized.  I was just so upset of being blamed so the meal was totally ruined and part of my Christmas eve.    I just don't understand why this even became a big deal.  Maybe Micheal thought that he heard fried instead of dozen.  Maybe I didn't enunciate dozen clearly enough so that it sounded like fried.  It is a very loud open restaurant right smack in the casino.  Whatever the case, Michael, why were you so stuck on accusing me?   Do you really think that I could mistake saying dozen with fried or that I was trying to get out of my order of fried oysters for fresh oysters?  We didn't try getting out of paying for the fresh oysters, which are more expensive.  I just can't believe that I was even put in this situation.  Whatever the case, we will not be coming back.  There are some staff that still needs better training in customer service."}
{"text":"At first glance, this doesn't look like a seafood place that has deliciously fresh seafood! Well, they certainly proved me wrong. My husband and I started off with the calamari, which was fried to perfection. They also give a generous portion so you shouldn't mind sharing. The crab cakes are awesome...you get two, but they are sized appropriately. The crab legs are so good...and I like how they slice the shell for you so you're not flinging crab meat and shells all over the place. Try it here, you won't be disappointed =)"}
{"text":"Clam chowder was pretty good. If you are looking for a pan roast though, go straight to Palace Station's Oyster Bar. Even with the potentially long wait times, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome place with a cool bar stool atmosphere! I've had the king crab leg special, the ciopino and the gumbo. All delicious! I came with an Italian friend and he was really impressed with the ciopino. Prices may seem steep for a casual bar stool joint in an off strip hotel ($31 for ciopino, $19 for gumbo, $26 for 1.5 lb of king crab legs...) but it's really worth it."}
{"text":"Terribly over priced canned seafood served in an atmosphere of suffocating second hand smoke.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO TO LONG JOHN SILVERS!!"}
{"text":"It's not that it was bad, I finished all of my food no problem. However when compared to the other oyster bars in town it's pale. The portions are smallest of all the other bars. The prices are the highest of the other bars. And the dishes feel mor Latino than southern. The gumbo wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best either. I'd say don't waist your time, go to sunset station or palace or any other place in town really."}
{"text":"FRESH seafood. Small place inside South Point Casino. Did I say FRESH already. Texture & flavor were great on everything I tried. Clam Chowder - NEngland & Manhattan. Shrimp Linguine. Warm bread with real butter. Very casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Horrible place. This place service was horrible, and the food was just ok. Their clam chowder bowl were a lot smaller then Big Al's at the Orleans. Waiter took forever to come serve and never bother to come get the check."}
{"text":"Hubby and I won a free full course dinner at the Monday night football party, and we  have never tried this place, so we went on Friday the 16 of Jan before the offer expired. We got seated in the front, not really an \"ambience\" place, but the food and service were awesome. We ordered 2 glasses of Santa Margherita Pinot Grigio to start, picture does not show full serving, I had several sips.  That was filled nearly to the rim. YUM. Hubby does not eat seafood, so we were both authorized 2 appetizers plus entrees and two alcoholic drinks.  I got a cup of New England clam chowder.  It was delicious!  Picture shows...I added the pepper.  Only thing hubby could order was a chicken sandwich due to the lack of anything else not fish or seafood.  Our FANTASTIC  waiter offered to substitute chicken instead of shrimp scampi and hubby was SO happy!  He loved his meal.  I had the 1 1/2 lbs of king crab legs and they were awesome!   What a great meal, great service.  Thanks Southpoint for such an awesome prize giveaway.  We will now return because we know what this place is about,"}
{"text":"We came here because we were at the Southpoint anyway, and my sister thought it would be a good change of pace from our usual Mexican/Italian/Steakhouse rotation.  I was in agreement because I saw the large menu over the bar proclaiming various offerings like oyster po'boys and jamabalya for $7.95.  Good deal, right?  Wrong. This was for weekday lunch only. some of the things are not even available for dinner, and if  they were, the price was about triple.  We both ordered the fish and chips. ($23) Her bf got the shrimp and scallop combo. ($21). Ahem. In what universe are shellfish cheaper? I was assuming it would be a monstrous portion of gigantic fillets at that price point. You know what happens when we assume.   There were four small chunks of battered fish atop  a pile of fries.  They were all crisp and hot, and the fish was nice and white, but come ON!   I have no idea what kind of fish it was, but for that price tag, it damned better have been cut from a mermaid's tail.  And there was no accompaniment like salad or cole slaw either. Only spotting of anything green was pickle specks in the tartar sauce.  Could they be charging for the ambience? Well, considering the fact that it's cafe style seating in an open area of the incredibly loud, bustling casino, I'm guessing not.  The waiter was very sweet and seemed almost sheepish. I'd be embarrassed to bring the check, too, buddy, and I come from a long line of unscrupulous carpet merchants.  It was one of those occasions where you're forced to balance the scales however you can; up to and including scooping the entire contents of the cracker basket into your purse and leaving it all right on top, daring any intrepid employee to say a word.   My sister did just that and we strolled out unchallenged. I won't be strolling back."}
{"text":"Great amazing experience, if you love oysters you must come here. Super fast super clean, super friendly."}
{"text":"I luv this place!  It always satisfies and the wait staff is super friendly!  My favorites: Lobster Grilled cheese Steamed Clams Clam Chowda Fried Calamari Oyster Rockefeller Ciopinno Crab Cakes  You come into this place and think - hmm ok a quick bitenothing too fancy, you place your name in and wait patiently - as you get seated you get a great view of the people passing by - SUPER GREAT PEOPLE WATCHING SPOT! You are greated right away and the waiter gets your drinks and delicious warm bread and butter.   I absolutely luv the lobster grilled cheese here- you almost crave it - if you have it - lobster so sweet and the cheese complimenting every bite- this is  a must have!  The crab legs are always good here, i don't know what they do to them but its a sweet salty combo when eating them.   Oyster Rckefeller, hmm last time I ate something this great was at the ACME Oyster house in New Orleans (which is a must as well) - super d lish full of flavor and just melts into your mouth - i could probably eat about 2 dozen of these by themselves!  I tried the steamed clams in white wine sauce, these were okay - a bit smaller than what I had expected. but still real good.  Another must have, my friend had the Ciopinno and it was to die for! super flavorful and jsut everybite  the flavor jumped out even more!  The prices were as you would expect in a seafood resaraunt not cheap but not too expensive.   I will of course be back to tantalize my taste buds!"}
{"text":"We love Oyster Bar at Palace Station  but we have the kids with us this trip. So we decided to try this 1, it was pretty good. The pan roast is different than the palace station waster bar it was still good but the Oyster Bar palace at Palace station pan roast is much better. The gumbo was good, good bread great clam chowder. The lobster grilled cheese sandwich was good but we didn't feel it was really worth the price. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here with a bottle of wine.  The seafood pasta was good, but not amazing. The bottle of wine was a nice touch with dinner though. They have a bunch of seats at the bar and then some tables. Service was kinda slow. Our waiter seemed disinterested. Price was decent, especially since the wine was half price!"}
{"text":"You would never figure the South Point would have one of the best Seafood Restaurants in Las Vegas.  If you can look past the decor and the smell of cigarettes and horses (when the Rodeo is in town), this is the place to be!  The best Pan Roast in Las Vegas.  It is full of seafood, shrimp, crab meat over a tomatoe base rice.  I've eaten here over 20 times and each time the food has never disappointed.  The NE clam chowder is creamy and sweet.  The Manhattan clam chowder is great and I would recommend.  I start with the lump crab cocktail.  They have a special mayo/mustard sauce that hits on every note.  It is sweet, savory with a hint of mustard on the back of the palate.  Great start!  I usually get the Cioppino and my wife gets the Pan Roast.  The Pan Roast is flavorful and a mouth full of seafood with each bite.  You get the sweet from the seafood, a dash of  another creaminess from the tomatoe base on the rice and kiss of wine on the back end of the bite.  Delicious.  The Cioppino is full of seafood and you can taste a whiff of the ocean with each morsel.  Lobster, clams, mussels..you name it.  It was better than the Cioppino at the Italian restaurant located here at South Point.  The seafood Diavolo is great and spicy and the Linguini and Clams is a can't miss also.  Never had a bad meal here in all my times.  Dinner usually cost about $70, but well worth it.  I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"+Great service--server went out of her way to get me brewed iced tea instead of gross Nestea from the dispenser. +They have Splenda! +1.5 pounds of king crab for $16.95 +Good fries.  The fried shrimp and scallops were so so.  -Didn't love the bread. -No ambiance. -A little pricey.  I'll probably be back for more crab legs and to try the lobster grilled cheese."}
{"text":"I hate this place.  To begin, the hostess/cashier barely greeted us and just pointed over to the bar area. The server that we had was non-attentive and was more interested in talking about plumbing with the guests next to us than asking us how we were doing. Nto even once. He was good at refilling our drinks though, lol. The hostess walked others to their seat yet we only got a point?  The bread was very chewy, but I liked the butter. Haha. Very spreadable. I was really disappointed in what we had ordered.  My friend had the Manhattan Clam Chowder and that was the only decent food item we had. He also got the Lobster Grilled Cheese because I had informed him that many Yelpers were fond of it. I took a bite and it was horrific. The lobster was tastless, only made with butter. The bread had lots of butter. It was just butter over-dose.   I ordered the Louisiana Oysters and after the first one, I didn't even want to finish them but I did. It did not taste fresh at all. I actually went here because I was craving crab soooo bad. I got the 1 1/2 lb of crab for $20. Tastless. Maybe if they would have steamed the crab instead of just boiling it then I would have liked it much better. Not even my lemon peppered sauce concoction made it worthwhile to eat.    The disappointing part was that the chef was checking up on us and giving us real customer service much more than anyone else there.   When we had went to pay, the hostess/cashier looked at us. Then her phone rang. She proceeded to answer her phone and ignored us until she was done with her call. When my credit card did not read as she swiped it, I asked if she could input it manually. Then she said she would have to write down my credit card number. WHAT?   I would not go back to this bar and would never recommend it to anyone since you are over-paying for mediocre seafood and the worst service I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Every year I look forward to eating here on our annual trek to Vegas and this time I left totally disappointed. Ordered the lobster grilled cheese like I always do and was left wondering what I really was eating. There was hardly any cheese and the lobster appeared to be breaded. Normally this sammy is ooey gooey cheesy goodness with fresh (not breaded) lobster. For $26 I at least expect the cheese to be melted. Stars are for the warm sourdough rolls and New England chowder which was creamy and had a decent amount of clams. Unfortunately I won't be back."}
{"text":"Their oysters are huge and fresh. Cheapest dozen raw oysters in Las Vegas (Mon to Thu happy hour price.) They are not Kumamoto or any fancy oysters but can't complain because of the price. I've eaten here many times in last 3 years and I never got sick from eating their raw oysters. (The worst thing you can get.)  Their raw clams are fresh most of the time. One time I got a bad tasting clam and I had to spit it out. For some reason, their raw clams taste saltier than the other places.  Minus one star for not being able to order take out. (Sandwiches and soups)  *Secret tip... We always tip the guys that shuck our oysters or clams before they start shucking. They always pick big fresh oysters and clams for us."}
{"text":"This place it great! It's a little pricey, but I think it's worth it. They have a wonderful oysters Rockefeller and the shrimp in the shrimp cocktail are HUGE! The service has always been good when I'm there and the people are always pleasant. It's about half bar seating and half small table seating, so you can choose. It's a somewhat limited menu with different fish items, but everything I've had there has been super tasty. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Yummy, I love this place!  My favs:  Shrimp Cocktail  Fried calamari  Oyster Rockefeller  Scampi   This place is really good, very fresh, I always bring out of towner's here, we sit at the counter and enjoy Cadillac margaritas!"}
{"text":"So.friggin.delicious.  Mark was our chef and I can't speak highly enough of him. We ordered the lobster grilled cheese sandwich and the ciopinno and they were both SO good! You can get the ciopinno spicy, with white sauce (it's served in a nice red sauce), or a combo of red & white. You can't go wrong.  Seriously the best shrimp we've ever had on the seafood platter appetizer. Huge, thick and meaty (just the way us girls like 'em!).   Mark served us a sample of the clam chowder and it's the best I've ever had. Can't wait for a big bowl of that next time. Winter is upon us y'all! I need good soup!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"South Point Hotel and Casino has a variety of places to eat.  This one serves seafood fare and everything we ate here was delicious.  We started with the clam chowder, I had Manhattan, he had New England (that's how we roll).  The NE was better (i reluctantly admit) very creamy.  We shared a plate of Shrimp Scampi on fettucini with garlic cream sauce.  Might fine sauce, I must say. Our dining partner had a dozen oysters on the 1/2 shell.  He said they were VERY good.  I can't get past the ew part of eating an oyster like that.  Bake 'em, fry 'em, put 'em in a stew, I am all good,. Fun place to hang and have a drink and some tasty seafood."}
{"text":"I live right down the road from South Point so, I was beyond excited to see that they had an oyster bar AND happy hour for these oysters Monday thru Thursday 12-4pm.  Came here with my BF and all his roomies. I think we went a little H.A.M. on what we ordered but, I think that's what comes with having days-off....GLUTTONY!!!!  We had a bottle of wine, oysters Rockefeller (2 orders), pan roast (2 orders), dozen oysters on the half shell (2 orders), calamari, clam chowder, and gumbo.  It was my 1st time having oysters Rockefeller and, I'm not sure what took me so long. The oysters/shell was so large that there was so much oooey-gooey cheese and spinach in the shell.....YUM, I can taste it now! Pan roast was definately smaller than we expected but, delicious nonetheless. It's not like Palace Stations' pan roasts so, don't expect anything of that caliber here.  And just a note, the rice they serve with the gumbo/pan roast is the boxed rice...as an Asian who loves her rice, this was a semi-problem.  No complaints on price though because after splitting the costs among 5 ppl, we paid $40 each. Ridiculously not bad for all the food we had."}
{"text":"I have certainly had worse dining experiences. The service while not really existent is at least not rude. I will say that the portion size for a $23 Combination Pan Roast is the worst I have ever seen."}
{"text":"Hungover? Staying at South Point?  If you answered yes to both of these questions then you need to bring your butt over here and have yourself a nice cup/bowl of Clam Chowder.  They have plenty of other seafood dishes at this spot, but I can't review them because the day I came here all I wanted was some soup.. and by God that was the best Clam Chowder I've had since going to the Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. The soup was nice, thick, hot and creamy with perfect amounts of clams and potatoes. One bowl of soup will cost you $8.00 but they bring you warm sourdough rolls that will most definitely soak up all the leftover alcohol dwindling in your body.. delicious! And if you're the thriftier person they offer cup portions at $4 and ice water of course is always FREE.  I'm sad to hear that others had bad customer service too because our server, Alfredo, was truly excellent. He was super nice and honestly the best server I've encountered the whole week staying at South Point."}
{"text":"There's no take out. I was disappointed because I really wanted the mussel dish but didn't want to sit and wait for service. I wanted to take it back to my room so I could dive in and truly enjoy my food, lol."}
{"text":"Had the tasty meaty crab cake in a bun and lobster grilled cheese. The lobster grilled cheese did not disappoint. There were many plump succulent lobster in  every bite. Both sandwiches came with chips ( made with real potatoes). Ordered oyster rockefeller to start with. The oysters were baked with cheese and spinach and they were pretty awesome.  The service was not too shabby either."}
{"text":"Food is always really good. Emmanuel our server is great took good care of us. He's handsome too  clam chowder was full of clams and creamy. Linguine and clams were perfect. Oysters Rockefeller were so good the husband and I fought over them.  The other servers were also very attentive too. Our chef mark was really nice and did an awesome job. We got seated and they didn't miss a beat. This is our go to!  Thanks Emmanuel and Mark! !!"}
{"text":"A friend took me here on my first visit to Vegas. This was a pretty cool place even though I am not an oyster fan. They do serve other meals so don't worry if you don't like them either. The seating was great, as well as customer service. On my next visit I may try this place out again to see if there are any additions to the menu."}
{"text":"Yummy seafood - ate here twice during my recent stay at South Point.  There seemed to always be a long line at this place (which is a good sign)... don't let it scare you because the line moves relatively fast and the food is worth the wait.   I got the Cioppino both times - because a) its my favorite dish and b) its that good.  I also tried the New England Clam Chowder -- its very tasty (and a bit filling!)  My bf had the Crab Cakes - he said they were ok - nothing to right home about. I personally don't like CC at all so I didn't bother trying them. We also tried the Jumbo Shrimp cocktail -- it was delicious -- but I felt $13 for *3* (although jumbo) shrimp is just a bit much.   I'll definitely be back there when craving seafood in Vegas and/or at South Point. Its not cheap, but seafood places shouldn't be cheap. Having said that - its not the most expensive seafood place either. Somewhat typical."}
{"text":"Great place for some good seafood. Split the King Crab legs 1.5 pounds and the clam chowder did not disappoint either. Elisabeth was our server and was friendly and attentive. Great value, will go back. Pricing very affordable as well"}
{"text":"I've been searching for a place that serves Manhattan clam chowder and finally stumbled upon this gem. We went during lunch hours so the pricing was pretty fair. I was hesitant deciding between a cup or a bowl at first, and went with a cup. I was so impressed by the chowder I even ordered another bowl! The oysters and clams on a half shell were very fresh and delicious. Aside from the pleasing taste of these dishes, I just wasn't very impressed by the service. The waitress seemed a little backed up and stressed out serving the few tables by us and didn't check up on us often. It's okay though, everyone has their days."}
{"text":"This is our second visit to the Big Sir Oyster bar. There are so many choices for dinning in Las Vegas that we don't usually hit the same place twice on one trip. But the food is so good, we had to stop in again. Today I had the lobster grilled cheese sandwich on grilled sourdough bread. It is simply amazing. So simple, stuffed with large lumps of lobster and delicious white cheddar cheese, yet so delightful. It's a must try."}
{"text":"You would never figure the South Point would have one of the best Seafood Restaurants in Las Vegas.  The place tends to have that smoky smell but hey a casino is a casino.   The wife and I ordered the gumbo and halibut. My gumbo was great. The seasoning they used with the rice etc. was fantastico. My wife's Halibut was so great it melted in her mouth.   The South Point hit a home run with their oyster bar and if you don't mind the old world casino smell go for it. If you happen to hit the place during the last weeks of October be ware because the Rodeo is in town and it tends to smell like somebodies ranch."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and this place is the Bomb, I've tried just about everything on the menu and everything has been super tasty. The only down fault is this place gets super packed and it's a very small area, there's a bar that's not to big and a few tables. When it's busy you'll be waiting a long time to get seated, but it's worth it..."}
{"text":"Meh, I've experienced way better. We sat at the bar and ordered Manhattan Clam Chowder and Fried Shrimp and Scallops. Clam chowder tasted pretty good, hence the two stars. I wonder if it's fresh. But because nothing else was fresh - i doubt it. At least it didn't taste like it was from a can.  The scallops were extremely mushy, to the point of disgust. We told the waiter, then one of the cooks, nothing was done. All the cook said was that they try not to overcook the scallops. Makes sense, but c'mon at least cook them. We barely ate anything off our plate.   Unfortunately for them (and the diners), everything appeared to be made from being frozen. Everything looked that way. I was hoping for something fresh. I guess my hopes were too high for a casino restaurant.   We noticed that they shake all fries and fish in the same bowl for seasoning. So, because of  that the fries taste like fish. I guess that's okay if you are eating fish&chips, but not for the homie next to us who hates fish and ordered a chicken sandwich. Fries were mediocre and over seasoned, by the way.   Upon looking at the menu, we thought it would be a really good choice...sorely disappointed. I will not come back here."}
{"text":"1 star = for the awesome & flavorful clam chowder; one of the best I've ever tasted  2 stars = for the fried calamari.  Great and generous portion!  Every bite was crisp.  I don't like the sauce though.  3 stars = oysters!  We always get a dozen...they're fresh and yummers!  4 stars = the way they cook in front of you...check it out for yourself!  Go try it now if you are craving oysters.  They usually have crab leg specials too!  South Point is an awesome casino too!  Huge place and lots of video poker!"}
{"text":"Well, me and hubs were pleasantly surprised.  Needed something quick and hearty at 10 pm in the South Point.  We opted for the counter at the oyster bar.    After great debate.....gumbo? linguine and clams? We landed on calamari and clam chowder.    My New England clam chowder was filling, creamy, buttery and well seasoned.  My husband was less impressed with his Manhattan clam chowder but said it was good.  The calamari was flavorful and cooked near perfection - just slightly over.    The service was very nice, friendly and efficient.  We were full and happy within 20 - 25 minutes.    The prices are a bit high.  Chowders are $8 per bowl and calamari was $12.  Entrees range from $19 - $27 for gumbo, pasta, fra diavlo and such.    All in all, a very nice dinind expereince.  Little to nothing to complain about.  Warm chewy rolls with soft butter served too! A definite plus!  We would go back."}
{"text":"Date of Visit: 1/15/11  Reason: to treat my brother from Hawaii for some oysters that he'd been craving all day.  What did \"we\" have?  1. 2 dozen half shell oysters:  they were fresh and were all opened in front of us.  Not sure what type of oysters they were, but they were the appetizer size oysters.  They were bigger than normal, which is a plus.  2. 1 dozen clams: again, not sure what type of clams they were, but they were smaller than I thought they would be.  The good thing about them is that they were very tasty.  Just give it a little dab of tabasco but no lemon and you're good to go.    3. 1 1/2 lb. of Snow Crab legs:  this is the dish that eventually didn't make this review a 5 star review.  Why? Because the legs are previously frozen and already cooked, BUT the way they reheat them was dumping them into boiling water.  This causes the flavors to go away because it was being soaked in the water.  If they were to steam them, it would've been much better.  Good enough for us because we were craving these dishes all day!  Hope this helps and Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Located in the South Point Hotel. Worth stopping by. Oysters are meaty and delicious. Clam chowder was creamy and on point. Service is outstanding. Ambience is nothing to brag about but otherwise, this place delivered."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop in for a bowl of clam chowder, it was edible but nothing id write home about. Home is Monterey, CA so clam chowder is tough anywhere else. Was sat fast at the bar, the service wasnt bad and the food was served pretty quick too. $8 bowl of clam chowder, sure why not if your really craving it. But wouldnt make a special trip as i felt like it was just a bite to eat and nothing memorable."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant t, They have probably the best New England Clam Chowder ever. It's inside the Southpoint casino."}
{"text":"The food is excellent but the wait can be long. Get one of the pan roasts, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was impressed for a oyster bar at South Point.  Came here to eat a quick snack before a movie. Had clam chowder and some oysters. Both dishes were good and fresh.   Service was also quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Seafood delicious, clam chowder, delicious best seafood restaurant in vegas..............."}
{"text":"get the panroast- combination of crab and shrimp in a buttery creamy tomato sauce...its yum!"}
{"text":"I tried the SalmonClub Sandwich....Ummm it wasn't what I expected - When I think of a club sandwich I imagine something built like a BLT. Thin layers of stuff but no this was a big sandwich with a thick piece of Salmon and Smoked Salmon. I love smoked Salmon so enjoying that was a given but everything else in the Sandwich just didn't work for me. Too much was going on.... My Mom really enjoyed her Shrimp Scampi but had to add salt for taste (I hate paying for something when I have to season it myself) My Dad just had the Clam chowder which looked really good. I may just stick to that on the next visit. I would like to try the Lobster grilled cheese as well.... Service was good and speedy, ya I'll be back to try other dishes!!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour prices are unbeatable, $11 for half oysters & half clams, sign me up! Seafood is fresh and delicious. I saw a guy next to me order the shrimp cocktail, dang the shrimps are HUGE! I will surely get that on my next trip. Service is always good, the waiter had a big smile on his face the whole entire time, very inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came to this place with high hopes. The wait at the Oyster Bar in the Palace Station was much  too long, so we looked for an alternative. Sure, there was no wait here, but there still was a decent crowd dining at this joint. Here's what we got:   [Apps] Louisiana Oysters: not that impressed with their oysters. I've definitely have had fresher tasting stuff. I didn't think these were worth ordering. Calamari: Great app, but that was expected with something fried. Oyster Rockafeller: These were pretty much the same oysters as before, but masked wit a buttery spinach spread. I felt like I was eating spinach dip on a shell. Couldn't even taste the oyster. Bloody Mary Oyster Shooters: Nothing impressive  For the entrée, I ordered the Lobster Grilled Cheese. It was an ok dish, but overly slathered with butter. It probably would have been a little better  with more cheese melted into it. Lots of lobster meat in this sandwich though, which was very good. The homemade chips that it came with had a nice crisp to it, but it had a tad bit too much salt  All in all, it was a pretty mediocre meal. I can't see myself coming back here. There are far better alternatives in Vegas. Initially, we came here just to down some fresh oysters, but that ended up being the worst part of the meal."}
{"text":"I've been to about four other oyster bars in town (station, palace, orleans, suncoast) and this one is pretty good. It's the same size and set up as the suncoast one- an oval bar with the cooks in the middle with a few tables around.   I had the gumbo @ $17.00 (wild rice, shrimp, sausage, chicken, okra), which was pretty good but not as good as palace or station's (but better than cheesecake factory). The flavor was really good and had thick sauce (traditional). It has less seafood than the palace/station version which explains the lower price. The shrimp and chicken were pretty good size, though. The hard rolls were very good. I like that there is a cracker basket with a variety of crackers, ritz, saltines, including oyster crackers (love it).     It wasn't spicy (like a little heat) but Cookie (our server) gave us Cholula. She was really good- refilled his drink without my husband asking. She was very friendly, always had a smile on her face and would check on us periodically.  My husband got the crab and shrimp pan roast and enjoyed it (but his favorite is still palace). There were a couple crab shells that he would of preferred to not have.   The bill for both of us was $38, which was pretty good.  After reading the other reviews, I am curious to try the linguine with clams and the fish and chips next time. The special was 1 1/2 pounds of crab legs for $16.95- a lot of people ordered that."}
{"text":"Oysters aren't my thing. They never have been, and yes I have tried them multiple times. I can't get over the consistency. So this probably isn't a fair review since oysters are their main thing. My dad likes them, but he's not the one writing this review.   As for the other items on the menu. They are just ok. Probably something you can get anywhere. Nothing stands out or is super amazing.   Salmon Cesar salad: the salmon was really fishy. Waaaay too much dressing on the lettuce.   Linguini with clams in red sauce: if you look at my picture, everything is pretty much swimming in the sauce. This was pretty much a soup with noodles and clams. The sauce was a little on the bland side. I had to put some Tabasco sauce to give it some kick. The noodles and clams were good though.   New England clam chowder: thick and rich. Lots of potatoes and big pieces of clam mixed in. I would order this again.   The service is excellent. My water glass is always full. Bread basket is never empty. Staff is smiling.   I'll probably be back, but not because I picked it."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Big Sur  I was very disappointed.  The food was not good  the portions were ok.  The staff had a give a F*\/%k attitude.  If you want a great oyster bar. Go to Stations Properties. Especially Palace Station Oyster Bar. Maybe the chef and staff from Big Sur Oyster Bar should to Station Casinos oyster bar to get so training."}
{"text":"Wife and I each had same of lunch portion shrimp jambolaya. Was quite good. I added crush red pepper, ground black pepper, parmesan, and a bit of salt. We also split a side of fresh made potato chips. They needed salt which we added. Very good also. Thanks folks. Fairly quick service here and just right everything."}
{"text":"Good place to go for some seafood cravings especially while wandering around the South Point casino. The crab cocktail is tasty and the lobster grilled cheese and other sandwiches are good. I'm not a big fan of the Cajun or Creole dishes because they are not really accurate therefore I don't find them worth the price.   If you are looking for a light lunch this is a good place if you want a really good seafood dinner or creole Cajun food I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"Decent food, horrible service. Three of us went. We all got our food at different times. My aunt was done eating before I was served. And I was halfway done before they brought mom's out. Had to ask to get refills on water until we were leaving and once the waiter dropped off the check he disappeared.  So unless you are going to the movies or bowling there just don't eat there. Even then, you might try the deli. So different than Primarily Prime Rib."}
{"text":"I came here for their happy hour half off oysters. Their oysters are very delicious and big. I love oysters so this place didn't disappoint on the oysters. I ordered the deep fried shrimp and scallops From the lunch menu. It was tasty but portion was pretty small. It was more like an appetizer instead of lunch. I would recommend to come here for the oysters for sure. I haven't tried the other stuff on the menu but they looked pretty decent."}
{"text":"MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT! I don't know maybe I'm trippin. You guys know I just got back from New Orleans right??? So I ordered gumbo for $20!!! Why did it taste like it was from a can! The okra was hard, not cooked all the way and the sausage was extremely rubbery. Well you can see for yourself with my pics. So thennnn, I return it because I literally CANT eat it. So then they return with (drumroll please) some #PinkOysters!!! If you don't believe me look at my pictures. I think the oysters were diabetic or something. Maybe it was that time of the month. Oh, did I mention the oysters were $16 for 1/2 dozen??? Yuuup! The customer service was good and we sat next to some cool people...THANK GOD!  Enter this place at your own risk."}
{"text":"The food is average.  The oysters are the most bland I've ever tried.  The shrimp cocktail and crab cocktail are very good.  The salads are not worth it at all. All fairly basic for the price.  If you eat here go for the hot dishes and stay away from the salads and sandwiches.   The cooks and waitstaff are friendly. The hostess is not. Sometimes they throw the food at you pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Oysters!  Hey I love them. I am down with \"half shell\". When dealing in the raw, one must demand fresh. Fresh is what I get here. I had fantastic service. Prices aren't over the top. For oysters in the raw, I go here for decadent arrays of those little mushy creatures I love so dearly."}
{"text":"Had the Crab cakes and they were great. Hubby had the linguini and clam with white sauce which was buttery, creamy, and fair amount of clam.  Alfredo was our waiter and we loved how attentive he was to our needs. Coming back as often as we can."}
{"text":"This used to be one one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. I looked forward to eating here for a year and was greatly disappointed. The lobster grilled cheese used to be the best sandwich I had ever had but it has changed and not for the better. It is lacking in cheese content, it is supposed a cheese sandwich after all. The clam chowder is still decent but my Bowl was a bit gritty. The fish and chips my brother ordered was amazing so that is what gets the two stars. Overall a highly disappointing experience"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Friday. Don't miss the lunch specials on the board. Server Alfredo was like a extremely friendly street ninja. Back and forth taking care of me as needed. Always knowing what I needed before I did, taking care of me and silently moving on to the next guest. Ordered a dozen to start. The chefs hands were a blur as he popped them quicker than my eyes could follow and had them  sitting in front of me almost immediately.  Well done gentlemen."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. The clam chowder was good. Fish slider with homemade chips and fried calamari were good as well. We received good service from the hostess and servers behind the bar."}
{"text":"One night for dinner, my bf's mom took us out to eat here.  The food was not bad, but nothing to really rave about. I had a New England Clam Chowder, which just tasted like soup I could make out of a can. However, my bf's mom had a linguine pasta with oysters that looked really good. This place wasn't great, but it didn't suck either.  + pros: + seafood was fresh, which was surprising since we were in the middle of the desert.   - cons: - there was a fly in my water. i don't know how the waiter didn't notice it when he poured my water. - restaurant is situated right in the middle of a casino.. not like most casino restaurants where they're usually enclosed so you aren't bothered with the chaos going on. but this restaurant was literally placed in the middle of the casino, and you're pretty much eating right next to all the slot machines and a huge walkway. sucks because when i was trying to eat, there were people smoking in the casino almost right next to us... not so pleasant."}
{"text":"So I'm reviewing the raw oysters mostly with some consideration for the place as a whole.  I came here after searching the web for good oyster deals in Las Vegas.  It's not the greatest place and separate from all other casinos.  So I was hoping for the best.  Alas, it was not to be.  I walked up to a mostly empty restaurant on an early Monday evening and was seated right up front in the bar.  I asked the guy behind the counter if they had an oyster that was large and briny as I like a strong salty, seafood-like flavor.  He showed me what they had and they were sizeable sure enough.  And even though I missed Happy Hour (before 4PM), I ordered a dozen anyways.  A dozen for $27.  Not outrageous but not a happy hour price either.  My spidey sense was tingling because they had that kinda orangy clam like color to them.  They also looked a bit dense much like clams do too.  But still, I was hoping for the best.  Unfortunately, they were completely tasteless.  They were called Louisiana Gold Seal Oysters.  I had to dump a bunch of seafood sauce on each one just to taste something other than a cold lump of goo in my mouth.  I know most people don't like briny, salty oysters.  But that's my thing and a reason some gals like me.  At least they were fresh and very cold (well stored).  A customer sitting next to me asked how I like them and I told him the truth.  He said he was having the chowder and said it was good.  I peered down the counter and saw a couple eating.  The lady had the Alaskan crab legs and unless they were dry, it's hard to go wrong there since they are shipped pre-cooked and frozen from Alaska.  They looked ok.  That's why you should buy Alaskan crab from Costco and not a 5* dining establishment.  The waiter asked how I liked them.  I told him the truth.  He made a sad frown but did not offer to get a manager or make any kind of amends.  I asked him if I could've ordered one or three instead of the dozen and he said yes.  I asked how much each would be if I ordered one or three and he said $3 each.  I was yelled, \"THREE DOLLARS FOR THESE?\"  Realizing how loud I was, I chilled out, paid the bill and left.  If you like salty, briny oysters, this is NOT your place to go to.  I go all around Vegas looking for the best oyster deal and for what I'm looking for, this is NOT it.    This place is getting two stars only because the guy next to me looked happy with his chowder and the place was clean and quick (I've been to empty places that took forever, god knows why).  My normal go to is the new-ish oyster bar in the Hard Rock.  I've never seen it have a line.  They usually have at least 4 different types of orders.  They are open to 2A on Friday and Saturday (to 12A all other days).  They don't have a happy hour.  But so far this is the place to beat.  That Palace Station line is long but after this, I may have to wait in it just to try it."}
{"text":"The food here is bland and sucks.  Just go to the Oyster Bar at Palace Station.  I hate Station Casinos, they blow, but the Oyster Bar is awesome.  The Manhattan chowder at Big Sur:  Campbell's tomato soup with canned potatoes and clam juice.  Oysters Rockefeller:  Bland.  Small oysters, taste of parmesan and cream and nothing.  No flavor layers. No salt.    Pan Roast:  more tomato soup, with unflavored unseasoned shrimp and lobster.  Not even hot sauce made this better.  Sad.  The bread, beer, and service were okay.  I will never eat here again.  It should be closed.  Too expensive for crap food."}
{"text":"I read some positive reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a go.  I went on a Thursday evening and the bar wasn't crowded.  I was seated quickly by a friendly young man.  It took quite awhile for the server to come.  I was surprised how he didn't couldn't answer simple questions such as what the contents of the Bloody Mary Oyster Shooter were or what vodka was used.  This place has a very small menu, so I would expect my server to be knowledgeable.  I ordered oysters on the half shell.  They didn't seem super fresh but definitely weren't spoiled.  I like crackers with mine but their cracker baskets were so crammed full, finding an unbroken packet was like getting a $10k pay out playing single bets on the penny slots.  The Tabasco was old and crusted and the cocktail sauce tasted cheap.  My server was polite but never asked how things were, if I needed anything, and he was slow to refill my beverage.  It really felt like the bare minimum service.   I had a far better experience at the Gold Coast oyster bar my fella took me to but its just too far to be my regular place. (Oysters fresh shucked, bigger, prices better.)  This place wasn't awful, just not what the yelp reviews led ms to believe.  I am planning on trying Big Al's next week. Hope its better than this experience."}
{"text":"Ok SouthPoint, you really need to name this salad after me. I've been ordering and coming to this restaurant for at least 5 years and still it hasn't made it to the menu. I get people asking me what I order as its soooo yummy looking. It's a Caesar Salad (tossed and mixed with the dressing) with the lump crab from the appetizer but I have it grilled. Every server including Manny who knows it best knows to put it up as soon as he sees me sitting down at the counter. It's quite pricey but worth it ($20). Use your SouthPoint points from the reward card to help finance it."}
{"text":"So the cook Jose was super nice and helpful. Our server Lorena was nice too but the place was so filthy! We sat at the bar and instead of cleaning any of the 20+ seats, they chose to jam us between two parties (who did promptly get up, but then they left the seats uncleared with dirty dishes and half eaten food for the entirety of our meal) which was super uncomfortable and left the rest of the experience tainted with other people's leftovers and dirty dishes.   We didn't have super high expectations going into an oyster bar at the south point, but we did expect it to be clean. Instead of having employees standing around talking story and letting one busser do the whole room himself, encourage everyone to help and pitch in. That's just me, but hey, what do I know. Lol"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I don't like to come here often, because a shorty (literally) like me hates eating at a bar where everyone can see you dining from across the way (and the casino for that matter).  It is located right next to the cashier's cage and many many slot machines.  If you can get past that, this Oyster Bar Does have some delicious eats.   I have tried their Oysters, Crab Legs, Manhattan clam chowder, Lobster Grilled Cheese and their Cioppino.  Omg Cioppino is to die for, but let me get back to that.    Oysters, can't pass it up, you're at an Oyster bar.  They crack it fresh right in fornt of you.  Honestly, for crab legs, you are better off going to a buffet.  Manhattan clam chowder and their New England Clam chowder are delicious.  Reminds me of Bay Area when you go to eat the Clam Chowder bowls, but thier chowder is chunkier!    I love their Lobster Grilled Cheese, I think its very expensive though, but then again it is Lobster.  I remember it used to be about $18, I think, but when I went there this past weekend to fulfull my craving the price was right around the $30 mark, think I'll have to pass this time.    So on to the Cioppino.  I must have missed this, or it could be a new menu, but I could see that everyone was dining on some monstrous bowls.  We took my friend here and as he ate the Cioppino he kept saying \"Mmmm, OMG, Wow, Oooh, this is great...\" LOL, so we had to come back to try it ourselves.    Um, yes, we were spewing those same words.  Its a $31 bowl of goodness, big portions for two, maybe even three to share.  Mussels, Calamari, HUGE Scallops, shrimp, and lobster sitting on a bed of linguini in this delicious tomato based sauce.  Seriously, I'm not often a pasta eater, but today, man was I glad I agreed to have pasta that day.  We shared the bowl and still had leftovers.  I'm telling you, its that good.    Pricey, yes, but a must try YES!"}
{"text":"I am a local in Henderson   I love this oyster bar.  Whenever I go to South Point I come to the oyster bar and find Claudia!!!  She is so friendly and helpful. Always recommends something good. The food was great, but the service was the Best!"}
{"text":"Second time now i had a whole plate of oysters rockefella! I could of ate two maybe even 3. service ain't that bad and the pai gow table is just 50 steps away. never really tried anything else! but the oysters are great!   I don't like bloody mary drinks but i had to try the bloody mary oyster shooter, i don't like it but i still ate the oyster."}
{"text":"Wow. This place really knows how to do New England clam chowder right.  First impression when you see the thickness of it's consitancy is \"this can't be good\" but it will taste will blow you away.  I want the receipe."}
{"text":"This was my fifth or sixth time here and to be honest it was hit or miss.  But today everything was spectacular.  It is honestly the first time I haven't seen a line or had to wait. One thing thats for sure is that the service is always great.  Our server was fast to greet us,  very friendly,  and very efficient.  My girlfriend and I shared a bowl of new England chowder and it was bomb diggity! Not too salty,  plenty of ths, and the texture was absolutely perfect.  My girlfriend had the steamed clams and I was really jealous because that white wine and garlic sauce is a 10 out of 10. I went for the pound and a half of King crab legs and it was good.  Not the best but not bad.  Steamed crab is Steamed crab right?  I will definitely be back and definitely point other r people in this direction.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Salmon melt was horrible. Inedible. Oysters were pretty good. Tilapia was ok. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Five stars for the clam chowder! Pass on the oysters Rockefeller! They lost a star because they were subpar. I've had waaaay better but I don't think I've had worse!"}
{"text":"This oyster bar offers $7.95 luncheon specials Monday - Thursday from opening until 4PM.  My wife chose shrimp jambalaya while pasta primavera with shrimp was my dining destination.  Each of the dishes were very fresh tasting and a return engagement is promised."}
{"text":"Second time here better than the first.  Last time I had the oysters on the half shell which tasted old.  Boy was I disappointed.  This time I avoided the raw stuff and went for the Gumbo.  After I added a lot of Tabasco and Cholula I got it tasting pretty good.  My wife had the king crab special which she has liked both times.   For Las Vegas it is an ok bet for a decent price.  I just hope she doesn't make me come back next time we pass this way."}
{"text":"Have the Rockefeller Oysters. They are excellent! Everything on the menu is really really good!! Service is OK, drinks take a minute to get because your waitress has to go get from the closest bar in the casino.   Decent pricing and easy to find in the casino, it's right next to the gross buffet.  For the record, I know Buffet's are huge with tourist but they almost always suck! Except for the Bellagio's. I would much rather have one good meal instead of heat lamped under/over cooked stale food.  Anyway, if you like mussel's and clams this place is a must."}
{"text":"This place was okay. Average food for a really expensive price. We got half a dozen oysters, which did taste fresh though, and decent sized. We also got the linguini and clams in white wine! Very good, the sauce is super creamy & there's a lot of clams! I do recommend it. If you're looking for a small bite, do stop by, but if you're hungry, go to the buffet in Southpoint instead of this place."}
{"text":"This was my first time at South Point and I happily tried a few of their restaurants! The Big Sur Oyster Bar was Awesome!! I had a cup of New England Clam Chowder that was absolutely fantastic (I'm picky about my chowder!!) for only $5.00! For my dinner I had the Fish Sliders for $16 that were very tasty, the tarter sauce is some of the best Ive had, I had to order extra as I like a \"wetter\" fish sandwich. The portions were good and I was stuffed. Elisabeth was my waitress and she was great, I felt bad though as there were 2 Floridian ladies next to me and the one had ordered the shrimp scampi from the menu and then kept insisting it wasn't what she wanted, think they brought it out about 3 times, it looked delicious to me! Elizabeth handled it well and had the chef come over and then Patricia the manager came over too until the lady was satisfied, i was myself mystified, you order the same menu item 3 times and its not what you want?? was impressed with the service and the food. I will be back next year and will be eating here again and again!"}
{"text":"After venturing around the misty lands of Las Vegas casinos for countless hours and spending money for a chances to hit the big jack pot...I was suddenly craving oysters and looked from afar this oyster bar!   My siblings and I decided to give it a try and see if oysters at an oyster bar are any better the any regular restaurant that would serve oysters.   In result, it wasn't all that great. The oysters were actually the same as any other place. The taste, presentation, and smell was all the same. Honestly there was no difference. However it is in a casino so for convenient purposes and if one wanted to have oysters and a drink in between their gambling session, it isn't too bad."}
{"text":"This place gets me right in the feels. Finding it was a pure happy accident as who would think that a tiny counter restaurant in the middle of a smoke-filled casino floor, in the middle of a desert, would house some of the best seafood that Las Vegas has to offer? I've eaten seafood up and down the East Coast, but this place is my favorite. I've been here about half a dozen times and have never been disappointed. The service is always friendly, the oysters fresh, the prawns are ginormous, and the mussels in white wine sauce bring a tear to my eye.  I've met locals who eat here regularly. That's the true sign of a great restaurant."}
{"text":"The happy hour for oysters and clams is Great! I was expecting a little bit more food then what we received,but all in all it was tasty. The popcorn shrimp was crispy and not dry like you get in most places. We will be returning again soon."}
{"text":"Took my brother and GF for quick appetizers...1:40 pm or so....one thing stand out and it was the service 100% on it, from hostess to server. Had raw oyster from LA, fresh and good. Oyster rockefeller, same type of oyster and they did a good job. Finally had the seafood ceviche, not bad but ok. Would I come back? Yes, would like to try other dishes."}
{"text":"This is my least favorite oyster bar, but I'm a seafood fanatic and I'm often at the South Point so I keep giving this place a chance. Time after time I am let down. This last experience I have had enough.  Our server Emmanuel (I believe that's his name), is the worse server ever. Our first experience with him, he gets our order wrong because he doesn't bother to write it down. When our food came out, the chef had to take it back and remake it. We are by far not difficult customers but I am clear on what I want, like for instance, rice instead of pasta? Come on.  This last time, my boyfriend and I decided on a bowl of clam chowder and the catch of the day. Our soup never came out. When our entree came out, I told the chef to cancel the soup. He confronted the server about not bringing out our soup and we hear the entire conversation. Instead of the server taking responsibility for the soup, he says, they didn't tell me. As a server, a soup is a starter. In this case, we only ordered one entree, but if he was confused, he should have asked if we wanted the soup first or at the same time. The soup is ready to scoop at any time. How can the entree be brought out first? After that, he never came to check on us. He took his mistake out on us. Like I said, this is not our first encounter with him. He saw we finished our meal and didn't say anything to us, just printed the receipt and placed it in front of us. I did not want to deal with him anymore so brought the receipt to the hostess and paid there. First time ever I did not tip in a restaurant. As many times as I have had bad service, I still felt bad and still left a little, but in this case, he was so rude and did not care so neither did I.  We were so unsatisfied with our service and meal that we went upstairs to the bowling area and got two hot dogs and a pretzel to eat while playing bingo.  The catch of the day was the orange roughy and it really lacked in salt. I tasted nothing from the fish or the sauce on it. I didn't know if it was just me so I asked my boyfriend and he said he didn't taste anything as well, just felt the warmth of the food.  Ughh, I'm frustrated because I want to like this place but I just can't. I probably will never be back after this experience. I hope the South Point does something about the service here."}
{"text":"Simply awful!  If you want a raw bar, this IS NOT the place. The only oysters they had were from Louisiana, HUGE, and just wrong!  The clams were middlenecks chewy and bitter!  The only good thing was the hot horseradish."}
{"text":"Best clam chowder on the strip! We love this place. My husband always gets oysters and I always get clam chowder and a salad at least. Everything we have had has been excellent and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"The quality of food has gone WAY down.  The calamari was pretty much just small fried batter pieces. I'm pretty sure the Cesar salad lettuce was just packaged lettuce because the color was dull greenish-yellow and just thrown into a pile on a plate. We also ordered the shrimp scampi, which was overall very average. The shrimp pieces however were large and pretty good.   But for the prices they charged, the food was bad. I get that the restaurant is in a hotel/casino, but it's not even a real restaurant considering the location and lack of walls."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and while the salad I always order here is always solid it isn't my number one choice Oyster Bar to go to. The ceaser salad wouldn't stand alone it's the Ahi Tuna that makes it so good. I order it blackened medium rare and it's always fresh. The ciopinno here doesn't compare to Stations ciopinno. Not even close. It's $35 here and that's $15 more than Stations and they give more fish in theirs. It's not the price that's the factor it's the taste and amount of fish that make Stations the winning ciopinno. It's more expensive here because they serve lobster in theirs. The service here was good and is an ok choice but I'll stick to Stations from now on. Solid and delicious."}
{"text":"1 pound of peal and eat shrimp and pan roast add the lobster with pasta is what we had. It's was AWESOME! Super fresh and delicious. This place will not disappoint you."}
{"text":"went twice during our stay at SOUTH POINT -- dinner thursday evening and lunch saturday.   food was pretty good both times. we had:   loved watching my FRIES getting tossed in a big bowl while they got seasoned.   the CALAMARI (cocktail sauce with extra horseradish instead of the marinara) -- could have crisped a little longer in the fryer but still awfully good.   a dozen OYSTERS (actually a couple dozen oysters since we had them both times) -- they were a little dry and i had to work a little since they did not sever the abductor muscle. but i love those juicy, little nuggets so still worth the effort.   CLAM CHOWDER (like there's a style besides new england -- what is that red stuff anyway ??) -- i managed a tasty spoonful or two before the kids loaded up their bowls with oyster crackers.   steamers -- clams, white wine, garlic and a little bread to sop up the juice -- there's nothing wrong with that.   the nice thing about an open kitchen is you get fed and a floor show. the bad thing about an open kitchen is sometimes the floor show detracts from the experience. at lunch, everybody seemed animated and happy to be there. at dinner the droll little trolls behind the counter clearly wanted desperately to be somewhere else.   if they were my crew, i would oblige them."}
{"text":"Definitely the best deal in town. They give pretty good size servings and fairly cheap. Everything on the menu is recomended."}
{"text":"I've been to this small restaurant several times, while visiting Vegas. This place has really good seafood, which is cooked in the center of the restaurant....for all to see. This place is always 75% full. The staff is great,  the restaurant is clean and the service is great. Love coming here. The food is a little pricey, but worth it"}
{"text":"Good was so so and over priced. Service was pretty good though.this Filipino water waited on us and was very nice. Forgot his name though. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Seattle, SF, and other famous places for Oysters. For this place to be in Vegas and with my low expectancy on quality food away from the ocean... I was very impressed. A dozen will run you $24 but well worth it. Other dishes included was Lugini and clams which i saw prepared within visual range. Ocean like bar theme but not too much interaction with the staff. Would have liked to see more atmosphere but the food made up the difference. Great job."}
{"text":"Stay away and do yourself a favor. Greasy food, served cold. Very little flavor and for some reason too expensive. We ordered the scallops- creepy oil puddled in the bottom of the plate, breading fell off to reveal a tasteless little scallop. Gumbo is cheap soup, no roux, no coloring. No good. Just the wrong thing at the wrong place.  Paid north of $60 for the worst meal of the week."}
{"text":"I had the crab legs, and New England clam chowder. My girl had the clams on a half shell, New England clam chowder, and shrimp scampi.   Needless to say we are not happy with this food. I have made clam chowder, and I have also made crab legs that have had more flavors in them. Now for the clams on a half shell well a casino chip is bigger than they are. Also we have made some low fat shrimp scampi that tasted better than this meal.   My simple requirements for a restaurant are; to cook better than me, not hard right? Really guys come on. To all that want to try this restaurant take this how you may but this is your prime example of grade B casino food. Enjoy your stay or your meal."}
{"text":"IHATE I ignored the reviews and gave them a try.  So I ordered the combo pan roast with lobster. It was by far the most bland thing I've ever put in my mouth. Absolutely horrid.   The review could have been saved by a little customer service. I took two bites and pushed the bowl away. Never once did a server check if everything was ok. He would walk by drop a drink refill and keep moving. Server even cleared the dishes of the people eating with me and again never addressed the elephant in the room which was this uneaten dish.   This dish was completely devoid of flavor. Complete let down as I was looking forward to dining here all week.NEVER AGAIN and I'm spreading the word on this place... Stay clear"}
{"text":"We stayed here a few months ago and found an oyster bar downstairs. It wuz busy & crowded (that means it's good). We sat at the bar, r waitress wuz friendly. Ordered clam chowder soup ( hot & creamy), dozen raw oysters (melted in your mouth), half dozen fried oysters ( hot & delish but 2 much breading). After all that, we cudnt go 2 dinner with r friends... We'll b back in december!!!"}
{"text":"2 thumbs down. Pan roast was a big whopping disappointment. I could get a better one at Ritter's in Huntington Beach, CA for the same price and my mouth would be dancing with joy from all the flavors. Aside from the tomato sauce, that's pretty much all the flavor you taste. It's a shame for the fresh crab and shrimp it's made with because no other flavor was present. Oyster Bar at Palace Station is still #1 in this part of town."}
{"text":"Great Seafood stop for lunch. Soup was awesome - cocktails come from the bar - can't go wrong with a Bloody Mary extra spicy! Good size portions - great service and the sit down seafood bar - going to try the shrimp cocktail next time around - they are huge! Will be back again to try the seafood cioppino"}
{"text":"Big Sur is OK for oysters and seafood dishes. But we get better value and better tasting oysters at our regular spots. We came here for a pre movie dinner on a Tuesday night and sat at a table instead of the bar. There was no wait but the restaurant was full for most of our meal.  The location is at a major intersection where exiting hotel and bowling alley traffic meets with traffic moving laterally across the back of the casino. If you're sitting at a table, don't expect a quiet dinner, but one with plenty of people walking by, many smoking. So I would recommend just sitting at the bar.  The menu is one page with seafood appetizers, soup and salad, sandwiches, entrees, and a pound and a half crab leg special for $29. We started with bread and a dozen Louisiana Gold Seal oysters. The oysters were decent in size but lacking any briny or ocean flavor. About half of the oysters could have been shucked better with less shell. My wife ordered the linguine with clams in red sauce and I had the seafood diavalo with an anchor steam. My wife wasn't too happy with the sauce in her dish. My dish had a nice spicy kick with big chunks of seafood.  We had no problems with service. Take your check to the front to pay, the server doesn't cash you out. Prices were higher relative to other oyster bars. I would only come back here if we happen to be in South Point staying in the hotel or to watch a movie on $5 Tuesdays."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times, every time is good.  There's a counter for fast service, great oyster shooters, & good seafood"}
{"text":"Clam was good and hearty after eating a bowl ($8) I was full, I didn't have much space for the shrimp jambalaya we ordered. I'm glad me and my husband shared.  Overall great service, very attentive and our server Cookie was a sweetheart"}
{"text":"My birthday is long past, it is October 4th, and a friend at work had told me he was taking me to get some king crab on my birthday, well 5 months and 19 days later we finally made it. We sat at the bar and ordered the King Crab Special in case you are not familiar with this it is 1 1/2 pounds of king crab legs with butter and lemon for 16.99. I had actually never had King Crab up to this point... The lady working the bar let us try the clam chowder which for some reason I have always just come to the predetermined decision that i did not like clam chowder, until now.. It was \"AMAZING\" now my grade of amazing may be different then yours when it comes to clam chowder since i had never really attempted eating it until now, so please refrain from the Clam Chowder Critic Hate Mail.. Thanks. So back to my Crab. The cook set the mound of freshly steamed crab in front of me and said enjoy, and that is exactly what I did. The meat was delicious and very plentiful. I don't think 16.99 was a bad price for the amount of crab that we got. I was very pleased with the food \" a few new found favorites \" and the only reason why I took a star away was really due to the casino not the restaurant. All the smoke is not very pleasant when you are eating.   After eating here I think everyone needs a little crab in there life from time to time."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was just a kid. Around 13 years old ... Before the famous pound and a half of crab legs were just 16.99 ! That was great, but they've become more popular so with high demand comes high supply! This trip I brought my boyfriend & he loved it! From his beers, to the oysters, to the scampi, to the crab legs, to the bread, & the service. Our waitress's name is Norma from Guadalajara and she is just awesome! Nice, attentive, & keeps a genuine smile on her face ! Make sure to get her as a waitress. The manager of the shift was kind enough to come by & check on how we were doing & if the food was to our liking (that's always a good sign of service & that the staff here really cares about their customers) I will continue to come here forever and always. I wish the prices were low like I remembered, but this place is totally worth every penny !"}
{"text":"Wowsers!   So I ended up eating at this place because the cafe line was extremely long and nothing else was open. I wasn't too happy at first until I took my first bite. The New England Clam Chowder was surprisingly good and totally changed my view of the restaurant. It's actually up there with Fishemans wharf status.   In regards to other recommendations I recommend the gumbo which my wife had and couldn't get enough. My next visit to this place I'm definitely going to get something fried because everything looked so good."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night with the family when staying at the South Point Hotel Casino. Overall it was pretty good.  Pros: 1) Good, attentive, friendly service 2) Reasonably priced ($16 for 1 and 1/2 pounds of crab, $12 for fried oysters) 3) Decent food  4) SLICED CRAB! Yummy!  Cons: 1) Oyster were a little dry 2) Crab was a little dry 3) Kinda feel like this review is a little dry too.....LOL  Overall, pretty decent place to stop by if your in the neighborhood...or casino-hood."}
{"text":"Big Sur Oyster Bar isn't like any other quick and cheap casino eatery for gamblers looking to get some quick nutrients.  But I assure you it's nothing of the sort.   It's not cheap either, but probably one of the more affordable and convenient places to get cioppino with out braking your pockets and making reservations at since fancy shmancy Italian restaurante.  Other dishes include lobster grilled cheese, bloody mary oyster shooters and beer bartered shrimp and scallops.  Also includes the regulars (crab legs, catch of the day, etc.) As well as both Manhattan& New England style clam chowder.    The place is fast and right on the money with what I need, good food fast and close to home.    Service is mad friendly and helpful behind an open kitchen that provides that piece of mind for those skeptical about cleanliness.  Now the cioppino, it's on hit!  The tomato broth is piping hot and tasty when it comes out and includes a generous portion of scallops, shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari and lobster over linguine.  There is a tone down version that has less broth and more of a sauce, its called a Diavallo and just as good.  We usually share a portion unless you are \"mob boss\" hungry.  I like to pair it up with a  nice glass of Anchor Steam and keep the buns coming, ah thank you."}
{"text":"LOL, I love that I am considered a regular on Yelp here when I was in Vegas for a week. We stayed at our time share across the street and they gave us vouchers for the restaurants. If you couldn't tell by the fact that I am a \"regular\", we went there a couple times because the food was good and inexpensive. If we stay at the timeshare again, I will definitely be back to Big Sur!"}
{"text":"We went because we got a comp. The food was decent and the portions were huge the seafood seemed fresh we had the steamed clams for an app and then i had the diablo pasta which was good, it had lots of scallops and shrimp and lobster my bf had the fried scallops and shrimp.about $80 for an app and two entrees that were kind of bland. A bit pricey and i don't think we would have gone if it was not free."}
{"text":"Food: $34 crab legs, fish sliders, and ceviche for lunch. My husband really likes the crab legs and has come here several times just for this. It's a better deal than paying for a buffet when this is all he wants to eat.  They get the crab from Seattle and in the winter from Canada. The fish sliders were tasty, but even better if you add salt, pepper and lemon. Ceviche was terrible - rubbery and gross. I ate two bites. I had an upset stomach a few hours later which I suspect this as the culprit.    Location: inside South Point.   Ambiance: facing the casino, so noisy.   Service: our server Alfredo was great.  Very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive.   I didn't love the ambiance of the place and I think the ceviche was bad, so I think hubby will have to get crab here with friends!"}
{"text":"I like this oyster bar but wish it had oyster stew.  Prices are ok for high quality of food and good service.  Nice lunch specials.  Crab salad is gr8 and love the clams and linguini.  Gumbo and jumbalaya look good but too busy for me.. Good bar selection and spacious seating.  Oyster bar option available."}
{"text":"Seafood lacking soul  After watching a movie at the theatres, we decided to go and indulge in some seafood (party of two). This was our second time eating here and the impression Big Sur Oyster Bar made on us the second time was just like the first; lacking customer service, fast-paced, and with no personality. I understand that this may be a high volume restaurant with majority of the people wanting to get in and out, but I believe every restaurant should have a bit of passion for customer service.  I also understand that each restaurant has its own culture, but a restaurant in a major off-the-strip hotel should have a pinch or two more.   The food is decent. The Jambalya is soulless. The Combo Pan Roast lacks the flavor. It's sad when the best part of the meal is the table bread.  The customer service is sub-par with the servers at the bar gossiping about work drama and not even making eye contact to the customers. There was no suggestions for specials or meals, and our glasses of water were kept empty for the whole meal.  However, they were extremely quick to cash us out, which was probably a good thing.   Pros:  conveniently located in the Southpoint Hotel  Cons:  customer service & food  Over all 1.8 stars for poor customer service and no flavor to the food."}
{"text":"I give this oyster bar a 2 because the food and atmosphere is plain. We are regulars at the Oyster bar in the Santa Fe, but they close at 10pm so we tried this one since it was 11pm. It seemed like the workers were ready to go home. I was watching the chefs and every time they would get an order it was irritating for them.  Our servicer was Daniel, he was good. Always ask how we were doing.  Like I said the food was plain no spices, like we are use to. They don't offer a selection of oysters. I think the only kind they have is Louisiana oyster. It was ok. Not a true oyster bar. Their drink selections are plain too. I wouldn't drive far and pay what we did for this food.  It was OK not like we are use to with AL and the ladies and the Santa fe."}
{"text":"we enjoy our mealz here  ~  its quite spacious compared w other oyster bars & oysters r generally fresh  they have lunch specials under $10 M-T (noon-4pm) but i enjoy their regular menu & of course clams/oyster, etc  nobody that we brought here has not had a good experience  ~  BIG SUR deserves a solid 4-stars"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have had the good fortune of dining here on a number of occasions and I must say that the food is fantastic and the service is equally as fantastic. All the Chefs and servers are really friendly and helpful. The clam chowder is a must have and the crab legs are great because they are already split. I've pretty much tried everything on this menu and all items are really fresh and well-prepared. I don't know why the other reviewers keep comparing this to the Palace Station because to me there is no comparison. This place has better and more flavorful food."}
{"text":"Took my friend here for her birthday (and some gambling). She spotted the sign for king crab legs $29.99 so in we went.  They have a large counter area for sitting, and a few tables. No wait for the counter so that's where we sat. The king crab legs were 1 1/2 lbs for $29.99, so we ordered that along with 6 oysters.  Crab legs were a bit on the small side for king crab, and not as flavorful. I've had better.  Service was very good.   Overall, not a bad place to stop in and eat. Prices a bit high as normal with a casino. I do like the South Point and hope to come back and try a few more dining options here."}
{"text":"After reading all the rave reviews of this place we decided to try it! Bad move! Perhaps it was a fluke but we had an uninterested waiter, awfully strong and non-mixed bloody mary oyster shooters, and two bland, overpriced entrees. I was excited to try the lobster grilled cheese, but it was incredibly bland and lobster was a little over-cooked. My boyfriend had the seared ahi caesar salad that was incredibly fishy and actually made him run to the bathroom afterwards. I wonder why...?  We got out of there as fast as possible but not without feeling incredibly frustrated with the service and the poorly made, way overpriced meal we had paid for. Will NEVER go near that place again."}
{"text":"My Diavolo Seafood was perfect like always! thanks to Mark (chef) and Lorena (server) for the wonderful service and dinner! I recommend this place a 100% to everyone who love seafood or to those who comes to Las Vegas and want to try a different style of dinner."}
{"text":"Oh South Point how I did not know you had a yummy seafood spot!    I always thought there are too many good places in vegas to eat... why eat here... welllll its goood!!! especially when they have their happy hour like sale... half off clams and oysters!! yum! so worth it!    My bf got the cioppino  and he loved it.. $30 bucks and he said its worth it.. i tried it and i thought it was cool!   be sure to use ur south point hotel packet for a free soup!  its like 5 bucks but you get it free with a purchase of entree...   their lunch specials are cheap 7.95 for a few things... the oyster sammy was good!  the best thing here tho is the half shell oyster and clams for half off... its monday-thursday 12-4 or something... starts when it opens at 12!   check it out!"}
{"text":"It is a little pricey but I saw on the board that there are specials during the week.  The New England Clam Chowder was to die for, but it's very rich.  It's like the ice cream of soup.  Even just a cup of it with a meal was too much.  I had the Beer Battered Shrimp & Scallops with french fries and remoulade sauce. Delicious, but very rich as well.  I think the thing to do would be to get a cup of soup and then split an entree with another person and even then, you have to pace yourself.  This was my first time staying at South Point and I was pleasantly surprised at how extensive and good the dining choices are."}
{"text":"South Point. The destination I head to for movies, bowling, and the middle ground between my friends' homes.   I've always passed by  Big Sur and never thought of it more than an Oyster bar - which I am slightly allergic to, but I like to take a dip on the while side once in awhile - After trying a pan roast at a different location, we decided to take in some good eats.   Order the combination pan roast - good flavor but might've needed a bit more rice (could I have asked for more? I don't really know)  and the shrimp scamp - delicious sauce and the shrimps were pretty large.  Dozen oysters (for mis amigos) - they were also pretty large in size and I'm used to (and confined) to the smaller ones.   I will definitely be back to try the other concoctions that other patrons seemed to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch had the oyster po boy!! awesome waitress and friendly and quick service.  thank you"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite oyster bar in Las Vegas . Everything is fresh and top quality . Mon-Thur from 12-4 all their appetizers are half off . The Louisiana gold seal oysters are normally $24 , so $12 a dozen is a great deal ! They also have seafood sandwiches, pan roasts, and fish n chips . Really good oyster bar !"}
{"text":"Came here to try the pan roast since all of my friends rave about the pan roast at palace station. Unfortunately, I don't live near the palace station so had to just settle with this one. The service was okay at first, but we noticed two out of the five of our dishes were waiting to be served to our table and say under the weather for quite sometime. The pan roast didn't have that wow factor for me like everyone exclaims to have when they try it for the first time. I had to add lemon, salt, and pepper for more flavor. The fried oysters were rubbery and was probably one of the dishes sitting under the warmer."}
