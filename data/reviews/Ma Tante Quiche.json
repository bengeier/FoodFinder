{"text":"I got off the bus on a Tuesday to eat at this restaurant for lunch. Clean and funky decor. I had their pulled ham grilled cheese which was really yummy. It came with a beat & chorizo soup which was a little on the spicy side. It also came with a small leaf salad which tasted awfully salty. After 2 bites, I decided not to finish and told the waitress it was too salty. When at the cash to pay a woman from the kitchen said \"I heard your salad was too salty. Not to make excuses but sometimes the salt sticks together in the salad. You should have told us it was too salty, I would have replaced it\" (so it's my fault?). I told her it was very salty and I still had an awful salty taste in my mouth. She then decided to give me a chocolate-almond croissant to go and said \"well here's a dessert for you, careful, it is very sweat\" (which was quite catty thing to say on her part I thought). I do not believe I will ever return to eat there."}
{"text":"Une très bonne place dans le quartier de Pointe St Charles! en plein essor et fort de sa gentrification, ce beau quartier a droit à une très bonne place qui propose des diners et brunchs, de grande qualité et à prix très raisonnable. Ils proposent également une petite boutique de produits fins Québecois, et des mets à emporter tels des desserts et des quiches bien entendu ;-) N'ayant essayé que les brunchs, je recommande La totale bénédictine au jambon effiloché cuit à la bière et au sirop d'érable!"}
{"text":"Great little bistro I popped into for a bite to eat. Very friendly and attentive staff! I ordered the Deluxe Grill Cheese that came with a cream of pumpkin soup and a side of fries. Everything was delicious and would certainly go back to sample some more."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. My only complaint is that they ran out of pretty much everything brunch related by 12-12:30pm.  I had the quinoa salad and the smoked salmon had to be replaced by duck confit."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to go for brunch. It's one of the few spots in Montreal where you don't have to wait in line on a Sunday morning for 45 minutes to get your hangover eggs. The best things to order in my opinion are Le Liz (delicious croissant egg sandwich) and french toast. My boyfriend likes \"le total\" because it's very filling. Sometimes when I'm trying to watch my carbs I order the omelette which is cooked in a little casserole dish.   Also, when I run out of ideas for supper during the work week, it's so convenient to just stop by and buy a whole quiche to go. They only cost about $10 and can feed 3-4 people. Make a homemade salad and you've got a pretty decent supper.    In the summer, they've for a great terasse that's very dog friendly.   The restaurant is very clean and quiet. Staff is friendly and the ambiance is calming."}
{"text":"A great place with ready to go meals that are all fresh and prepared with local produces.  This place is a great addition to the neighborhood with great healthy tasty food. Traditional Quebec fare and other great meals to go are cooked fresh daily. They also carry bread from a neighborhood bakery that are quite good. They carry quiche, bread, sandwiches, croissant... and recently we tried a great \"Pâté de foie aux figues\" that was sublime.  A place to visit for sure!"}
{"text":"I really don't want to, but I have to knock a star off this place. The last time we stopped by the service was just terrible. Not normal Montreal passive terrible but actually so bad that it was noticeable and really took away from the whole thing.  Also, while the menu is still interesting, the food wasn't that great this time. It was much closer to average diner fare.  I'm really hoping that this place gets itself together though because I still think it has potential to be super cool and delicious."}
{"text":"Who'd have thought that one day in the Point,there'd be such a place? I was in the laundromat next door, this past summer, and the delicious aroma wafting from this place certainly did NOT have me focusing on my laundry!  I decided to take a quick peek  and ask the proprietor what she was cooking, and she graciously  told me it was chorizo quiche;unfortunately, I don't eat pork. No matter; there are delicious other quiches,as well as yummy soups, sandwiches,croissants, and a small gourmet grocery section as well.She even has the famous Arhoma boulangerie deliver their bread to her establishment, so now all one has to do is place his/her order with her and the bread will be reserved. ( specialty breads in particular).Sundays are brunch days. Great to finally have a place like this in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast coffee & treats while visiting Montreal; I think it was their opening week. Everything was delicious and the almond croissant to die for! The owner lady (I think she's the owner) is so incredibly sweet, she let me take pictures, and even made the pastry chefs put out more pastries for the photo, so sweet & welcoming! The place is also very cozy! (actually my profile pic was taken there!) bonne chance!"}
{"text":"Un café sympa avec des choix de café pour le repas du midi et un plat du jour. Quelques choix végétariens et un service efficace. On m'a permit d'aménager mon combo ce qui est cool :) En terme de prix on est dans la moyenne. J'ai cependant trouvé que mon panini végé était un peu light en terme de garniture. Pourquoi pas si je retourne dans le coin !"}
{"text":"J'ai adoré la tarte à la lime! Je la recommande fortement! Il n'y a plus les pains du club Produktif, dommage!"}
{"text":"What is there not to love about this little breakfast brunch lunch spot?  The decor and the spot is just too cute. Our server was so friendly and kind. The food was excellent and the perfect portion if you're hungry without being starved or stuffed.   They kept our coffee and water glass filled. Big gold star.   If I lived in the area, I would be a regular here. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Beau concept santé si vous avec le budget pour un petit sandwich à 10$ et un petit estomac.  Belle salle à manger :)"}
{"text":"This place is great! Stopped in on a rainy Sunday and ordered the Eggs Florentine, it came out perfectly cooked, with just enough hollandaise, and lots of spinach.  This came with wedged roasted potatoes, and really fresh fruits.  The service was fast and really warm and welcoming, and the hot chocolate I had was rich and creamy.  I can't find one thing wrong with this place, so it is an easy recommendation, they also had take away food, and judging from what we ate, it must be good."}
