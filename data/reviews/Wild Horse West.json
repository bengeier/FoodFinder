{"text":"White washed on the outside.  Inside just plain fun hangout.  Waitresses are great.

If you think that the place isn't a hangout, just count the number of bar stools.  Ought tell you something.

2.95 PBR  beers turned me in.  But do try a bowl of the house's chilli.  Ask for your onions and cheese on the side.  Mix it how you like.  The Cook has a winning recipe!

I'd like to be here on a weekend and ride up on a bike. Fun place!"}
{"text":"So many times i have been driving to or from the lake and had a discussion with someone about how good we have heard the burgers were at wild horse west. Last year a friend and i stopped in to try it out. This place is a bait shop and bar. Dirty boot cheap beer dive bar. You can sit at the bar or on picnic tables inside possibly next to other patrons. cash only. Chips only, no frys. BUT the bugger is awesome. Thick greasy patty, melted cheese over mushrooms and thick crispy bacon (my way). One bite then you know why you came.
I dont care for bars at all so this is what we do. Call ahead and be a bit patient it is a loud crowded bar sometimes. leave the family or friends with the boat and truck outside and grab every thing to go. Then its only a few minutes away from the lake. Now you can enjoy your awesomeness at the shore or on the water.It solves the problem of whats for dinner at the lake while setting up camp the first night. cheap regular hot dogs for the tikes. 
No more storys of good burgers.Now its time to eat good burgers."}
{"text":"Known for their burgers. It's a must order. You can't beat the price or the flavor. Grab a cold beer and bring a friend or four. My recommendation is if you enjoy a burger this is the place."}
{"text":"Fast service, cold beer, good food.  Great place to stop on the way to/from the lake, or just a cold beer."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a little kid going to the lake this would be our place to stop play some pool have a few drinks get some amazing burgers. The employees are nice always have a smile on. If you find yourself on this side of town maybe at the lake or at canyon race way stop in and get the Swiss burger on rye you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is the pub burger you have been looking for. Nothing fancy, just a good solid burger with a ice cold beer. Be aware this is cash only, but unless you fall in you wont need much."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Friendly staff! The price is RIGHT..$3 for a fantastic chili dog n $6 for a cheeseburger!"}
{"text":"A GOOD HONEST BURGER!!!  Thick, juicy and cooked to your specs.

 However-know what this place is.  This place AIN'T a franchise.   It is, as they would say on the TV show, a real \"dive\".  It's old.  It's not polished.  They have old TVs with only a few stations.   They're cash only.  They sell fishing bait up front.    The menu is VERY limited (they don't have fries or draft beer).  The patrons range from snowbirds (local vernacular for North Eastern weather refugees), to bikers, to rednecks, to young families coming in from recreation at Lake Pleasant and the local off road racing tracks.      

That being said, I love this place.  It's a little bit of the old Arizona that existed before everything was homogenized and sanitized into uniformity.  The staff treats you like family.  The place is informal-just be yourself.  And they serve what is in my opinion (and many others) the best burgers in the greater Phoenix area.      

Remember, we're talking hamburgers here, not Lobster Thermadore.  If you're expecting 5 stars or an Applebee's, you shouldn't come here.  If you come here, know what to expect: cold beer, good mixed drinks, a friendly, unprentious staff and the best burgers in town."}
{"text":"The real deal throw back to the wild west.  This place is the coolest place in north PHX.  Ben Avery and Lake pleasant are right up the road.  The cheese steak...."}
{"text":"My grandparents introduced me to this place.  

As the other reviewer said.. they do burgers... and they do them very well.  Can't say I've had a better burger.  Service is great and I've always met someone friendly when eating at the bar."}
{"text":"Can't figure out what's the hype? Only thing on menu is burgers, hot dogs and chili (3 on a scale 1-10). Oh and what they call a grilled cheese. Dry with processed cheese. Sent it back. So sad....was really looking forward to it. I guess if all you want is a meatball in a bun with a bag of chips it's the place for you!"}
{"text":"Simple menu. Cash only. Chili was particularly tasty. The Swiss burgers were quite good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burgers, but must say today when we went in, I was completely disappointed......
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
Whoever made the call to change the burger buns, made a EXTREMELY BAD DECISION 
Honestly we will probably never go back, sad"}
{"text":"Great burgers the Chilli is pretty darn good also. Local bar and grill so dont exspect much as far as decor. no frys but the burgers are worth it."}
{"text":"We made our way over to Wild Horse West again this morning primarily to ease the annoyance of a really mediocre breakfast stop at another place, drawn by the Bloody Mary's and thinking we'd finally give those famous burgers a try.

Mid morning and the place was packed, a testament to it's popularity and proximity to Lake Pleasant.  The service was, as usual, friendly and fun. The Bloody Mary packs quite a kick, spice-wise, and really hit the spot.  

We ordered the burgers and, let's say, these are good, basic \"real\" hamburgers: chopped beed formed into a patty like your mom made, no spices, just formed up and slapped on the grill. Garnish with onions, pickles and shredded lettuce. Add your favorite combo of ketchup and / or mustard and chow down.  I'll be having one of these again, no question."}
{"text":"Great burger for the location!  We ordered the Swiss Burger on a regular bun with green chilis and mushrooms.  Very yummy! No ambiance, but not needed in this location.  No football on Sunday though... Only 3 channels.  Bummer. But a good spot to hit for a burger!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! Probably the best burger in Phoenix area. Picnic tables, ice cold Rolling rock, who can ask for more.Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon on the bikes and the place was packed! Make sure you bring cash, no cards... Feel free to bring the kids, very family oriented."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about this place. I wanted to like it based on my parents enthusiasm for the place. From food to service it was all bad to worse. 

Stopped in with my parents on a Sunday evening since they recommended this place as they had eaten there multiple times in the previous 7 days. Since it was a beautiful AZ night we opted to sit on the patio out back. They had a few picnic tables full with patrons so we figured that someone would be around shortly. We waited for more than 5 minutes before my Dad got anxious & wanted to go inside to the bar & get the drinks ourselves. So we ventured on in & bartender (male) was just horrible. I understand a person is busy but when you have 2 patrons standing there 2 feet away from you & you actually walked past them on a couple of occasions at least acknowledge they are there & just say \"I'll be with you in a minute\" instead of completely ignoring them. I used to tend bar & waitress so I get it. If we hadn't driven 18 miles there one way I would have walked out right then & taken my money elsewhere. I get that they were busy but an acknowledgement & a smile can go a long way on many levels. While the was a bartender ignoring us one of the waitresses walked past behind the bar & completely ignored us as well. Finally after standing in front of the bar for approximately 5 minutes without a single acknowledgement the bartender finally comes over & asks us what we want. No Hello or Hi. We got our beers & then happened to ask the the blonde waitress (as she whizzed past us while my Dad was waiting for his change for the beer) if there was a waitress for outside or if we put our orders in with the inside crew. She just says \"She's out there.\" OK well in the 5 minutes we sat waiting for a waitress there was no one that was walking around outside. We ventured back outside to my Mom who was still at the picnic table. Waited another 10 minutes before a waitress finally came by to see if we had been served yet. Mind you the blonde was delivering drinks & food to the table next to us prior to this & saw us but never came over to see if we needed food orders taken & obviously we did since we asked her inside if we ordered outside or inside. Finally get our orders in with the brunette waitress & ordered Swiss burger medium. When burger was delivered (not by order taker) it was said to be medium-well. I told her I ordered it medium. Burger gets taken back into the kitchen & then right back out to me & she tells me it's medium. OK...you just said it was medium well so how did it get cooked less in the 45 seconds you ran it inside? She says the cooks said there's still some pink inside. OK. Whatever. By this point I didn't care anymore because I wasn't going to wait another 30 minutes for a burger to come out while my parents ate. Burger was plain to me as it didn't have a lot of flavor. It wasn't anything special. I grew up on a beef farm so I guess I know what good beef tastes like. I specifically ordered the Swiss burger for the rye bread but you couldn't taste anything but white bread. The bottom piece of bread was toasted pretty hard while the top piece was not toasted at all so the top piece of bread got all squishy & started to fall apart. And $0.99 for a few canned mushrooms? Really? 

At the end as night was settling in we waited for the bill to be brought out to the table. Yet again another 15 minute wait before we finally got up & walked into the bar & had to ask for the check. This time it was our waitress that was behind the bar that said \"oh you need your check?\" Seriously we have to ask for the check as well? Just from watching body language & attitude of the waitresses it seemed like they catered to those that were bikers & were far more friendly to them instead of giving all patrons a friendly smile. Had I known that I would have brought my brother who is a biker. The only positive things I can say about the place it that they had cheap food & beers. And it was nice to sit outside where the music wasn't blaring like inside. 

My Mom had actually eaten there 3 times that week (Dad twice) & she did say the 1st time was much better than the time I was there with her. Unfortunately for them when I am visiting Phoenix I won't be taking my money back there. I am used to hole in the wall burger joints & have been to many a great ones but unfortunately Wild Horse West doesn't fit into that category for me based on the crappy service as well as the mediocre food we experienced."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place and drive out here regularly. It's a pretty bare bones atmosphere with fantastic burgers and a friendly staff and clientele. Quality is consistent. LOVE the chili!   (Hi Sherry! ;) )"}
{"text":"I am new to the area and was driving around just to see what is out here. I saw all these cars and trucks at this big white building. It was around lunch time and a stomach growling so I stop here. They mostly only serve burgers. Boy I was impress on how they tasted. Thick and satisfying, but they only take money. They service is accommodating. I will go back again."}
{"text":"This place has been here forever.  The burgers are good.  Nice thick pieces of meat on reg store bought buns.  No frills, back yard burger type food with a bag of lays chips for 6 bucks.  They have a good selection of beer and a few craft beers to choose from.  The inside is old and small and filled with plastic tables and chairs.  Again like a backyard bbq type feel.

Theres a sign that says they have the best burrger in AZ and that is a far stretch but it is good.  Cash only."}
{"text":"This place has been in business a long time, despite a location that has no other commercial business around it for miles. There's a reason for that. They offer good food in an atmosphere that will remind you're not at some chain restaurant. The owner of this facility leases the property from the state annually, so he hasn't been inclined to invest a lot of money into the building. This is why they don't have deep fryers (it would require an electrical upgrade) and it's also why they still have a dirt parking lot. Still, $6.00 for a 1/2 pound hamburger is about as cheap as any (non fast food) restaurant can get. 

Pros: Cheap prices. Great tasting hamburgers. Not a chain restaurant

Cons: location. Cash only. Limited menu"}
{"text":"In A Nutshell:

-Wild Horse West is a cool spot in the middle of almost nowhere.
-Set in the desert, you will spot this white colored building.
-It doubles as both a restaurant and bait/tackle shop.
-There is indoor and outdoor seating.
-When I was there, we sat outside.
-The menu is simple and short.
-Order the chili burger and the 1/4 kosher polish dog.
-The craft beer selection is nice.  I really enjoyed the Grand Canyon IPA.

Overall, if you are seeking some good old American comfort food, this is the place to grab it."}
{"text":"So far, my favorite burger in Phoenix!  This isn't like the dozens of other gourmet burger places that seem to be popping up everywhere.  This place is old, super low key, a hole in the wall type place but that gives it charm if you ask me.  It's a bar and bait shop so stop here if you are on your way to Lake Pleasant.  They don't even accept debit/credit cards, cash only.  The burgers come with a bag of potato chips, no fries.  Super simple but absolutely delicious burgers.  They give you a peppercini  on the side with the burger, haven't seen that before.  I have also had the chili which was also good but burgers are king.  Lately all I find are gourmet burger places, I'm not really into those.  I usually find the best burgers at dive bars and this so far is my favorite one in The Valley.  If you feel the same way I do about keeping burgers simple, try this place and don't forget to bring cash!"}
{"text":"Huge patty and great prices. Our friends brought out to this off the beaten track burger joint. \"It is the best burger you can get in Arizona.\"

I thought the ambiance was charming. Driving up to Wild Horse West was like pulling into a saloon in the Old West. I almost thought I should hitch my car to the post. 

Guests sit at picnic tables indoors. There is also outdoor seating. There is a small pool table. They offer domestic and export beers in bottles. I was disappointed they didn't offer any beer on draft.

The menu is limited. Burger or cheeseburgers with shredded lettuce, raw onion, banana peppers and pickles on the side. They had a couple of other offerings that I don't quite remember. They had a Swiss and half a slice of rye bread.

What makes this burger special is the size. It is a huge lump of meat. I cannot say that it is particularly flavorful, but it is definitely large. If you don't specify how you want it cooked, it comes medium well by default (more like a well than medium well).

I enjoyed the flavor of my grilled green chili and my sauteed fresh mushrooms. My warm burger buns fell apart too quickly. When I tried to top my burger with lettuce, the shreds kept falling off. I gave up quickly. The bacon was nice and thick. 

A basic burger was $5.99. A basic cheeseburger was $6.99. Tip: Cash only, and they do not have fries. A bag of Lay's potato chips comes with the meal."}
{"text":"Real burgers at this out of way joint. Great place to stop after visiting Lake Pleasant. 

Get a burger."}
{"text":"Excellent cooked to order burgers, amazing beer selection, great prices and outstanding service.  What more could you ask for!   Don't deliberate.  You won't regret stopping here!"}
{"text":"Best hamburger in town!!! Awesome chili too! Friendly service with a smile. I've never had a less than excellent experience there!"}
{"text":"Not the friendliest business, that is for sure. Service would best be described as 'rough'. Burgers were terrible. More like over cooked hockey pucks. Cash only. The owner / manager was aloof and got our order wrong. Waitress delivered all drinks by palming the tops of the beer bottles and drink cups. She later knocked over a beer on the table and didn't even offer to replace the beer she spilled. They were not busy at the time. Potato chip bags served with burgers were completely covered in some strange spackle. Will not go back."}
{"text":"The burgers here are very good.  Service was beyond terrible.  I get that it is a small place, but the waitress/bartender went on lunch and never said anything.  The cook brought  us our food and 10-15 minutes later asked us if we needed another beer.  We did as they had been empty since before food was delivered."}
{"text":"Now that they have A/C I have no choice but to give them 5 stars, as the old swamp coolers in the summer were the only thing holding them back before.  

Nothing fancy, just amazing burgers. Not a little amazing, a LOT amazing.  Simple but great. I wouldn't change a thing.  Ok, maybe add fries vs. chips. 20 years and nothing has changed,......not many places can say that."}
{"text":"Omg if you want a hole in the wall where everyone is happy and kids are welcome with picnic tables in the inside and $2.50 very cold Coors lights and only one thing on the menu on weekends and only two things on the menu on weekdays and a place that doesn't take debit card but has an ATM inside and it doesn't matter because your bill is $12.50 and you leave the rest of the $20 for tip because it was the perfect little experience....then come here, especially on your way back from Lake Pleasant, which seems like it's where half the little crowd came from on the day I was there. Did I say I loved it? I did."}
{"text":"I had heard of this place, but had never stopped. Coming back from the lake one weekend, we stopped by for lunch. Upon walking in I felt like I had stepped back in time. The place was simple, picnic tables, bar stools, and a pool table. There's a good mix of customers from bikers, boaters, senior citizens to young families. 
The staff is friendly and have quick service. The menu is simple and easy. I got a hamburger and my kid got a hotdog, both are served with a bag of chips. The burger was big, juicy and cooked to perfection. The hot dog was a jumbo dog. Best burger I've had in a long time. 
Now we make it a point to stop every time after a weekend at the lake. I would even considering driving up on any given night. Just be sure and bring cash or you'll have to use the atm."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in Phoenix since I moved here 5 years ago! Will be coming back here for a beer and a burger regularly. It's one of those things you crave till you get another one."}
{"text":"I enjoy these classic homestyle made burgers, but sorry, had to drop 2 stars because it isn't a burger without fries.  I've come here for years after Jeep trail rides and I would love to hear from owners why the establishment doesn't serve fries?"}
{"text":"Basic simple food, very inexpensive, but good. Great value. Bring cash, they don't take cards."}
{"text":"We just finished a long hike and need some refreshments. Loved the atmosphere. Service was great. They had a fairly large beer selection. Burgers were large and great value."}
{"text":"Wife and I have been here a few times. Always left satisfied!
1st - Cash only! Might be a inconvenience, but not enough to take away a star. 
2nd - They do not serve fries. Again, might be a inconvenience to some? 
With that said, I would have love to have chili fries. Their food is great! 
I love their chili, has a little bite, bursting with flavor. Their burgers are really good also. They don't have a large menu, don't need it. Its a simple bar and grill dive. I do wish they would stay open late on race night at the nearby Canyon Speedway. We don't come here all the time, but try to once in awhile."}
{"text":"Carefree Hwy may have moved but this landmark is still here! Cranking out the coldest beers and a killer burger! Been coming here since 1990 and never enjoyed it more than I do now!! Finally tried the chili tonight and regretting completely that I have not before today! Holy crap! Worth the drive from town just for it!

Do yourself a favor.. Slow down.. Stop in... Enjoy.. Support great local small business like this gem!"}
{"text":"First time to a place and they welcomed me like Cheers.  Got a group of seven together and we had a great lunch.  I'll definitely go back and take my wife - it's a joint but far from a dump!  And I'll be stopping by solo as well!

Forget the fries - they make us fat!"}
{"text":"This place is a GEM!!!

After a walk at Lake Pleasant, we decided to stop in on our way back home.

When you walk in, you feel like you've strolled into an oasis, more so if it's a 100*+ day outside.

The customers are locals, tourists, bikers, drinkers, seniors...you name it...no matter who you are you, will feel like you belong. 

No frills simple food and drink menu.

Excellent cheeseburger done old-school style!

We are locals and we will come back often.
We have found a new place to visit over the  summer and all year long."}
{"text":"No frills just great burgers served with chips.. We get here a couple of times a month. Go and kick back with cold beer (also full bar)  and really great burgers....  As burgers go this is up there with the best - a must go!"}
{"text":"They have a bartender in the morning that makes outstanding Bloody Mary's! Coming back for a burger soon! I hear they rock!

{"text":"Been going here for years . One of the best burgers around . Now I take my kids here and have them hooked as well. Highly recommend by me."}
{"text":"The burger was better this time then last. 
The chili dog is good
The chili is good.

The only complaint was the $2.50 for 5 slices of tomato, and I could have gone for some french frys too."}
{"text":"I had been told about his place by coworkers and decided to take my parents, wife and 18 year old out for the \"best burger\". I'll make this review short. I actually thought it was average at best. My wife and daughter would have given it a negative one if possible, and my parents, trying to be nice because I bought (I know the tone in her voice), said it was good. So my recommendation is don't go out of your way to eat there."}
{"text":"Not impressed by: cash only, having to pay for tomatoes (is that an Arizona thing?), bartender refusing to change TV channel from \"Species\" while we were trying to eat and one of our friends was kind of grossed out by it. Also, no french fries? Really? You're telling us that by charging for tomatoes it's still cheaper to pay Frito-Lay for chips than spring for a large Fry Daddy or some kind of commercial fryer?

It's not a bad burger, but that's about all the place appears to have going for itself."}
{"text":"Cheyenne was super and friendly. Food was good but Cheyenne made the experience memorable. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!  Philly cheesesteak is great, burger is huge probably a little too big for us and the bartenders are awesome.  Would come back, great atmosphere, very chill."}
{"text":"My parents took me here when I was visiting them in AZ.  I think they love the fact that the beers are cheap...which is nice.  But, I thought the food was fair.  My burger was greasy and over-cooked.  I think the fact that they serve the burgers on paper plates is fine but the place is just DIRTY - I didn't even want to think about the kitchen.  If you go here, DONT even go in the bathrooms - they are totally gross!"}
{"text":"Out in the middle of no where is a restaurant/bar worth stopping at for the best burgers around. This restaurant is conveniently about 3 miles from Lake Pleasant.

Whats to love about this restaurant/bar? It's simple......the staff is awesome and the food is amazing. We ordered 2 cheeseburgers with bacon and mushrooms added and 2 hot dog plates. The burgers were served with dill pickle slices, onions,  chopped lettuce and lays plain potato chips. The hot dogs were served with the same chips. 

The burgers were huge!! We were disappointed that they didn't have fries but after biting into the burger we quickly forgot about the fries. In fact we forgot about the chips too. The burger tasted so flavorful and was truly tremendous! The hot dogs must have been equally as good because the kids (1.5 yrs and 4 yrs) kept stealing the chopped up hot dogs from each others plates. We asked for just a plain hot dog with no bun and they gave us one free of charge.

We loved the atmosphere as well. The cook personally brought out everyone's meals and greeted everyone. She even was thoughtful enough to ask if we wanted the extra hot dog cut up for the kids to eat. It was truly the little things that made our experience here tremendous!"}
{"text":"Came in with high hopes and was not disappointed. Like everyone says the chili is on point, burgers are great, the beer is cold.  Be advised, it is cash only."}
{"text":"Heard the burgers were great here.  Well I don't see why.  Costco bun, very little seasoning to the meat but they got the temp dead on, comes with a bag of lays chips.  Many better places out there.  Bottle beer selection was ok.  Cash only no big deal.  4 burgers and chips, 2 bottles of beer and 3 cokes almost 50 out the door for a place with little overhead and zero ambiance.  Tried it once but that was all we needed."}
{"text":"Service was very slowwww. Don't expect fast anything here. They barely acknowledge you when u come in and sit at bar."}
{"text":"Great big fat hamburger cooked just as you ask.  All the fixens come. With chips it's only $5 and a half. I will come again!"}
{"text":"I love this little unassuming joint in the middle of nowhere it seems!! A very simple menu of burgers or hotdogs sandwiches or soup but always served fresh and delicious!! WhenI have been riding all day I swing in to grab a quick biteand never disappointed."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere. Cash only. Good Burgers. Good place to stop after being out in the boat at Lake Pleasant Burgers and Hot Dogs and Chili.."}
{"text":"Rustic atmosphere, bench style tables. Served on paper plates and plastic utensils but GREAT service and hamburgers. No French fries but you get a bag of potato chips. Had the chili burger, served open face, chili over meat with cheese and chopped raw onions over chili. Dill pickles and hot peppers on side. Excellent chili and hamburger. 

CASH ONLY

This was lunch, probably will not be able to fit dinner into my stomach. Will be back to try other stuff on menu."}
{"text":"Great burger, thick and juicy. Staff were friendly and the atmosphere was fun. I'd go again if in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing burger. Fresh, juicy, huge! Perfect ending to an amazing weekend! A must place to visit."}

It was as advertised - great burgers, made to order, with outstanding service and a ton of beer choices.  Very clean and nice atmosphere.  Seating is somewhat limited but it wasn't busy so no issues for us.  Highly recommend this if you want to take s drive to the lake or you're out in that area.  You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Perfect for what it is. A large dive bar in the middle of nowhere & somehow it's packed!! Burgers & hotdogs with chips/booze for cheap. Cash only. It's was just what I needed. Cool ride out here & cold beer with a\"backyard style\" burger."}
{"text":"The best cheeseburger I've ever had. I ordered a cup of chili and put a couple of spoonfuls on it. Delicious beef, fresh onion, I don't remember seeing any lettuce but who cares it's all about the juice perfectly cooked burger. It would have been better with fries but chips are a good substitute."}
{"text":"Best burgers in AZ.  Stop in for a cheeseburger, bag of chips, and a cold beer.  Hasn't changed at all in the 20+ years I've been going here."}
{"text":"Wow! This place takes me back to the Bristol Tap in Bristol Illinois (http://www.yelp.com/biz/bristol-tap-bristol-2#query:the%20bristol). The place doesn't look like much but if you don't mind the cheap grocery store bun, these juicy, thick hand-packed burgers are for you. They only take cash and only have bottled beer but the place was clean, the service was great and you can show up in your bathing suit on the way back from Lake Pleasant if you want to. Oh and no fries, just cheeps. They have a small patio out back with picnic tables and misters. Unfortunately, the address shown on this listing is incorrect. They are actually located on the east side of Lake Pleasant Road just south of Carefree Highway. Looking forward to trying their chili. Can't wait to go back for another burger! Please don't bring your gun. They have signs all over so I don't think they like that."}
{"text":"It's like your back yard...with a bar thrown up over it!  And it has a bait shop inside!  It's delightfully tacky and ordinary and unpretentious- exactly what I love.  The greatest thing for me is that it really hasn't changed much in at least the last 45 years- that's how long I have been familiar with and visited this place.  It's an oasis out in the desert...but not too far out anymore...where anything over flip-flops, shorts and a t-shirt is a bit over-dressed.

This is that refreshing place that time forgot- but people haven't.  Bring cash, bring a backyard BBQ frame of mind, and bring a smile, and be a tad thirsty.  That's it.  

May God bless and keep this joint going 'til the end of time- and not change a thing!!!"}
{"text":"Hey, wanna grab a burger?  We love this place!  It's basically a no frills bar and burger joint.  Huge burgers, cold beer and great lay back people watching.  Cash only.  Two can eat for under $20.  Gets crowded when the snowbirds come back to town."}
{"text":"Place has been here forever. Dive bar feel with interesting mix of locals. Great burgers though and bottle beer only. Cash only just in case you do not know. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Love the burgers and Philly cheese steak!  Great spot to watch the hot air balloons take off and land."}
{"text":"this place is OK?but the food delivery speed is a problem. We just ordered two burgers and it took almost one hour. How hard would it be to prepare a burger?"}
{"text":"Solid Burger. Go there almost every time I go to pleasant.  Simple and good and dude behind bar is always on point."}
{"text":"You want the best burger on the west side of the valley?  Go to Wild Horse West.  They grill and then steam them for the juiciest burger you've ever tasted. Green chile, grilled onions, bacon and cheese burger is my favorite."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch on the way home from the lake. This place is nothing fancy but they have amazing burgers and ice cold beer. I had a mushroom bacon and Swiss burger. It was great but my husband had the chili burger and the chili was amazing. I would definitely order that next time. It was so flavorful I wanted to steal his burger. The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Nothing like riding through the desert and stoping for a cold beer! And they finally have A/C!!!! It's awesome!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been out here yet you're missing the best burgers in town. Nothing fancy here just good food and everyone on staff are the best anywhere. Mike is the jack of all trades in the place and everyone else is warm, welcoming and just plain fun. This is our favorite place to go for burgers and beer, I swear as soon as it's mentioned I can taste them."}
