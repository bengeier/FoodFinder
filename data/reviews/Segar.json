{"text":"Took advantage of the Groupon deal and tried Segar for dinner. The menu is not very extensive but the choices are very interesting and there is a good selection, from seafood to proteins, however they lack any vegetarian options.
Highlights of the meal: Crab and shrimp fritters: nicely fried and cilantro chutney was a great compliment.
Prices are on par with similar restaurants in Toronto. Skip dessert and go up the street to Hollywood Gelato afterwards!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Segar and were very disappointed. The service was abysmal. We arrived for our 8 pm reservation and were promptly seated.   . Our companions had starters and that arrived in a timely fashion. Our meal did not arrive for an hour and a half.  During that time no wait staff approached our table or provided an explanation as to why the service was so slow.  We had to call over people at 3 different times after about an hour and 15 minutes and were told that our meal was being plated and still it did not arrive.    When our meal arrived, there was no apology nor was there any when they brought our bill.

This restaurant should learn the importance of good customer service.  Any restaurant can have a bad night but it is important to acknowledge it and deal with it.  This is unfortunate because the food is actually quite good and we live in the area and could have been regular clients.  We will be very hesitant to go back because of this unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Mmm delicious. Great alternative options, interesting options, and great veggie options."}
{"text":"I was disappointed given the good reviews. I thought this place would deliver an innovative mix of flavours but it didn't.

The shrimp/calamari appetizer tasted like it had been cooked hours earlier and warmed just prior to serving. My beef shortrib entree was ok, but lacked flavour. Same for the striped bass special my wife had.

A small menu doesn't bother me if the dishes are outstanding - maybe we just chose wrong.

We had dessert up the street at Hollywood Gelato. 

Ambiance and service was fine, but not outstanding. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the oft-troubled food landscape on Bayview.

I had the shortribs, and they were as advertised; excellent.  Great service, nice atmosphere.  I will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a Groupon for this restaurant during a recent visit to Toronto and really enjoyed dinner at Segar during the Victoria Day holiday weekend.  The staff and chef were professional, warm, and friendly and never rushed us even though we were the last diners of the evening.  We absolutely LOVE the spice route cuisine concept at this restaurant and were delighted with the chef's execution of the dishes.  They started us off with flatbread and two different spreads: eggplant and tomato and they were delicious!!  We were also extremely pleased with our light and flavorful pasta dish and tender steak.  We shared a poached pear for dessert and were a little disappointed that it was a cold dessert rather than warm which we've had and enjoyed before.  However, the taste was just wonderful!  Segar is also located in a lovely area that is worth exploring by taking a little walk before or after dinner.  We would certainly come back if we're ever in the Toronto area again.  Also, take a look at their beautiful website to learn more about this unique and delicious restaurant:

{"text":"My partner and I also had a Groupon for this restaurant. Our meals were very good. The buttermilk flat bread with the eggplant and tomato jam was delicious! I had the salmon which was perfectly done. I also had a very nice class of Pinot Grigio, which our server let me try first to ensure I'd like it. Very nice service! Back to the food; my partner had the pork chop which was also very tasty. He didn't like the black rice that accompanied it. I liked it, but found it to be a bit too salty. I had the poached pear for dessert and, although it was tasty, I was also a bit disappointed that it was served cold. Overall, we had a very nice dinner and would eat here again if we're in the area."}
{"text":"Okay it wasn't the smartest idea to schedule a first date at this place when it was -14c and rely on the TTC. It wasn't quite the pleasant and romantic stroll from Yonge and Eglinton to Bayview I had imagined. 

Segar is also a small place and every time a patron enters, well, the second law of thermodynamics does its magic and you get a good cold blast. 

Despite negative externalities, Segar still managed to deliver. Yelp classifies this as Asian Fusion. I think someone saw \"spice route\" and confused it with \"silk route\".  The use of piri piri in dishes should be an indication this isn't really Asian fusion, unless South Africa has suddenly been moved to Central Asia or Ancient Aliens flew spice between South Africa and Java. Giorgio A. Tsoukalos's opinion not withstanding. 

Really, nothing on the menu had any Asian influences. 

And maybe it's just me but the name itself conjures up Peter Seeger's Guantanamera (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFAGgla7oQQ) on replay in my mind. Why it didn't conjure up Seger's Feel Like a Number (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Drhf7SXIiS8&feature=artist) despite growing up next to the Motor City probably reveals the sickness that backstops my personality.

Anyway, Segar is a bit off the beaten path but well worth the trip even when it's -14c. It's fine dining at 1994 prices. Nothing really over $20 with most mains ringing in at $15. And portions are large. You get a big plate o' food. The bread service is refilled at their suggestion. Service can be just a tad uneven but great food, great prices, and atmosphere more than makes up.

It's a touch loud and dark and intimate. Alas, the table next to us kept using their iPhone flash to illuminate their menus. Once was a bit jarring but when they did it about a dozen times over the space of 15 minutes, you wish people like this were mocked more. Hey, haven't you dicks heard of the latest cell phone game... the cell phone stack? http://theweek.com/article/index/223137/how-the-phone-stack-is-civilizing-dinners-out-with-friends

I had the steak frites. You got a nice portion of meat, tender, done perfectly. The frites, though kind of soggy, were great. The veggie sides were more than decoration and quite delicious.

My pretty date couldn't finish her chicken based on portion size. We started with the piri piri shrimp and calamari. Both quite good. 

Anyway, a restaurant that deserves the 4-5 stars its been averaging on  yelp, for sure. Great first date restaurant that won't bust your budget. Just don't think of Peter Seeger.

{"text":"Nice global cuisine with a \"spice road\" flair.

Short ribs were _really_ good, as were the grilled calamari (top 4 I've ever had) portion of the shrimp/calamari appetizer.

Quiet late, could see how it could be a little noisy when busy.

Friendly, professional service. Did not rush us even though we were the last table."}
