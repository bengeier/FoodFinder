{"text":"Their chicken and wings are really good, but I've honestly thought about going to the one in Millvale due to the rude people who work here. I'm also pretty sure they are charging around $3 for delivery even if you are just a few blocks away, and it still takes an hour. Stick to pick up and brace yourself for a less than friendly experience. For anything other than the chicken or for faster/cheap delivery I stick with Ron's."}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken pizza with their awesome RANCH on the side is insanely delicious. I always get the largest pizza and always ask for extra ranch. The staff is usually pretty friendly. We usually order for pick-up, and it's ready on time."}
{"text":"Cold below average pizza. I ordered the 12 cut, the girl taking the order said \"it's square\" okee dokee probably tastes the same. No only was it not square, it wasn't warm, didn't taste good it was cold and way overpriced for the quality of food we got."}
{"text":"They arbitrarily decide if they will deliver to you based on how they feel that night. It all depends on the luck of the draw--good luck."}
{"text":"I had read such great reviews about their buffalo chicken pizza that my expectations were set pretty high.  When the pizza came, my sister and i were pretty disappointed.  I have definitely had better buffalo chicken pizza...the only plus was that it came with ranch to dip it in...and the ranch was good.

The breadsticks were really good.  The sauce that they came with was too.  We also really liked the fried mushrooms.

I would definitely order from here again, but I wouldn't get their \"famous\" buffalo chicken pizza."}
{"text":"I do like Frank's a lot. Their buffalo chicken pizza is good. But not amazing. Their ranch is super good. Breadsticks are actually my favorite thing. They also have really good fries with bacon and ranch \"Frankie fries\" are so good! Like amazingly. But sadly, where we live they don't deliver. Which were less than five miles away. Actually I believe were within a 3 mile radius. I'm not sure why they won't deliver but that's definitely a huge let down."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous!   Decent pizza shop food but expensive for what it is.  Employees are THE WORST!  Place looks dirty, employees are obnoxious & can't seem to do their job.  Like take an order correctly, prepare it within the time THEY say.  If they served 5-star cuisine for $1.00, it wouldn't be worth it!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and hoagies! 

Frank's has three locations. This one is in Troy Hill on Lowrie Street. They offer everything from pizzas, broasted chicken, chicken bites, breadsticks, pizza rolls, calzones, salads, hoagies, wraps and appetizers. 

My favorite pizza that they offer is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza, chicken tossed in buffalo sauce and covered with mozzarella and provolone cheese with a side of homemade ranch dressing. Yummo! 

I've also tried the broasted chicken, It's like fried chicken but a little different. It's pretty tasty as well. 

My favorite hoagie is the Diablo Steak Hoagie, seasoned steak, Buffalo sauce, Parmesan cheese, blended cheese and Ranch dressing. Outstanding! 

They do deliver if you work in or near downtown too!"}
{"text":"Franks is close to where I live. Recently ordered 2 calzones within a week. The first one was loaded with toppings and there was were fillings throughout. Not much empty dough onte ends.
My second orderws fir the steak calzone, there was at least 3 inches if plain dough on each end and very little steak and the vegetables that were supposed to be in the calzone were not present. 
Up in the air as to whether or not I will order from there again. 
I guess what you get is based on that days cooks attitude. I don't mind paying for what I order but I don't appreciate paying $12.50 for an basically large piece of dough."}
{"text":"Frank's is a consistent and reliable neighborhood place. Their broasted chicken is fantastic! Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  We are usually grilled chicken eaters, but their broasted chicken is so yummy we made an exception and ordered it two weekends in a row. 

Also don't miss their breadsticks which are garlicky and Parmesan cheesy and just all around delicious."}
{"text":"Other reviews are right there delivery is all based off of who you call on the phone and get that day sometimes they'll deliver to me sometimes they won't and I'm literally 2 miles from them and when they don't want to deliver they are very rude

Food is ok"}
{"text":"Terrible service and a refused to deliver whenever I live 1 mile away?!? Also a Terribly long wait for average food. This Franks always messes up the food and the buffalo chicken pizza is just terrible here. Like how!?? There renowned for that... I suggest you go to the Franks in Milville it's 100 times better and they don't fck up your order. I will take my business elsewhere. I also suggest you looks elsewhere or go to the one in Millville."}
{"text":"Forgot my ranch two times!!! Wouldn't respond back when I wrote them..... Been six months since I ordered from them and they obviously do not care about getting back with customers. Disappointing"}
{"text":"The best pizza on the north side period. The buffalo chicken pizza is stellar and the ranch dipping sauce is addictive as hell. People that work there are always super nice and the price is very competitive. I have had their boasted chicken once or twice and it's good too. Definitely check this place out if u get a chance!"}
{"text":"I live close by and I always buy local if I can, so when I order the food from here I was not expecting it to be so good and the people that delivered it to be so nice.

The pizza is light and filling and the chicken is Delicious. And with daily Specials I've already ordered from them a few times. I look forward to giving them my future business.

4 Stars cause I have yet to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Food OK, service even less. Rather go to Ron's for pizza in Troy Hill."}
{"text":"We just moved to Troy Hill and when asking people about the local food scene, Frank's was typically the answer. I'm all about local mom and pop pizza shops so naturally I was super pumped to try them (especially since we're just two blocks away!). 

As for food, their pizza is pretty average. We just had basic plain and I thought it could have been cooked a little longer. However, I did like how big their pizza is. Crust is one of my favorite parts of the pizza and they definitely do a good job in that aspect. I hear their buffalo chicken pizza is very famous, so maybe next time we decide to order I'll get that. 

Now while their pizza is just okay, their chicken is AWESOME. We got chicken bites and you can tell they make everything right there in the kitchen-- breading, etc. They were so good that you really didn't even have to dip it in hot sauce or ranch! 

There is one or two tables in the small lobby area, so I wouldn't recommend eating there. Definitely a take-out kind of place. 

For being our first introduction to Troy Hill, the staff was super nice. Made a great welcome! They were friendly and definitely made me feel like they wanted me to return."}
{"text":"The pizza tasted fine. But the cheese was extra rubbery. The people at the counter were exceptionally rude. No greeting, just a curt \"You got a order?!\" and couldn't have cared less about us being customers."}
{"text":"I really tried with frank's on troyhill. Giving it a second, a third, then a fourth chance. This place is horrible, it honestly taste like it was made with hate. I've never been hung up on before when I  stated it was delivery, or asked \"what\" when my call was finally answered. The pizza is practically  inedible. I felt like I was eating the pizza box with dried ketchup as I forced myself to eat a slice. Do yourself a favor, eat your actual cash it might be more satisfying. I will  not be ordering from franks ever again unless some serious changes are made, hopefully new management. Troy Hill really needs a good food spot, Franks is 100% not it."}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken pizza is phenomenal. My mother in law ordered the white pizza and the flavors were overwhelming in the best way possible. You are going to want some extra cups of their homemade ranch too! I love Frank's"}
{"text":"Here we go again. I ordered the Italian hoagie and it was a mess. I don't know what kind of lunch meat they use but it's sliced very thin and not very much lands in the sandwich. The thing was barely warm and I picked it up almost 10 min before they said it would be ready. I guess it was hot enough when they put the lettuce because it was wilted. It only had 2 slices of cheese and they were so thin that they were transparent. This place is terribly inconsistent.  The young man that took my order over the phone mumbles and I had to ask him to repeat a couple of times. When I pick up my food I realize that he's trying to sound like a thug, don't think this is best for front end help.  I wish I could get consistent food (good food) from this place. Maybe when I get good food the owners are there,if not, bad food. Don't know, don't care. Tired of wasting my money."}
{"text":"This is great pizza, but I guess they decided that one mile is too far for delivery. We've eaten here several times, but won't be doing so again"}
