{"text":"On y va pour l'excellent café et les sandwichs savoureux. Un plus: service très sympathique!"}
{"text":"Campanelli has your regular sandwich which is quite tasty but at a ridiculous price. 10-12$ for a turkey sandwich with no special twist whatsoever. Its a basic sandwich. I saw that they had special sandwiches of the day which might appeal to the regulars. It's cute but always packed and has odd hours. The service is fast and good. We didn't have a coffee this time but it's reminiscent of the Café Social or Olympico vibe but in St Henri. Locals sipping and lounging the Saturday away. The co-owned clothing store next door is pretty cute."}
{"text":"Le sandwich aux boulettes de viandes (veau) est délicieux. Les boulettes sont enrobées dans une fine sauce tomates qui n'est ni acide ni sucrée..goût très bien balancé..Le pain est parfait et tous les ingrédients sont frais. Le café est aussi délicieux.
Service rapide et amical."}
{"text":"Tony and the staff do a great job the coffees are excellent along with the sandwiches everything is fresh and the muffins and cakes are awesome. Best coffee house in St Henry if not Montreal"}
{"text":"Delicious and unusual sandwiches (though the bread could be fresher??) ...and they're too expensive, really. But the place has a nice vibe and is appealing and the design makes you feel like you're in Gastown Vancouver - very slick."}
{"text":"Cute spot with rustic interior and lots to look at all over the walls. Serving up decidedly italian style espresso with vac packed lavazza beans on an old rancillio. Unimpressive but servable shots. Their sandwich section looked more appealing though with many meat/cheese/dressing combos sure to please most."}
{"text":"Yet another great coffee hot spot in the city. Campanelli serves a serious coffee alongside some nice gourmet sandwiches. With Square George Etienne around the corner take your coffee to go and hang out in this great park!"}
{"text":"the best meatball sandwich i've had, amazing carrot cake and banana bread and fantastic service"}
{"text":"The Spot
We've been meaning to try Campanelli's for a long time. After what felt like an even longer meeting, starving and wanting some solid food we ended up there, and wow the Sandwhiches were to die for (an empty stomach can do that to you so we went back to verify).

Between the fresh bread and flavorful fillings, it was a good lunch. Upon first laying eyes on our feast I was doubtful that even in my hungry state I would be able to consume the entire sandwich, but by the end of our meal we had all finished our massive, meaty sandwiches and were fully satisfied. Don't worry dear vegetarian readers, there were veggie friendly options on the menu as well.

The cafe is perfect for grabbing good food to go, as they are fast and the food is easily transported. The cafe itself is more designed for take out but feel free to occupy the counters in the back and catch up with old friends. We opted for sitting on park bench out front under the summer sun enjoying the flavors.

What's Really Good 
Although on the pricier side for a sandwich (between nine to fourteen dollars), you're guaranteed to get your money's worth with fresh ingredients and healthy portions of meats and cheese. The staff is very efficient without compromising the quality of the food. However if you're looking to have a long lunch with a friend or a loved one, this may not be the appropriate place as the only seating available is a counter top, and there are no waiters, rather you order your food and pay and then seat yourself. The coffee is also among the best in the neighborhood. Only draw back, they need some better quality to-go cups.

You'll Wanna Know: 
If you're going to grab your \"pick me up\" coffee, Campanelli's is only open until 5 pm, so go sooner rather than later! Due to it's small size, it can be quieter and more comfortable to eat outside on one of the park benches lining the street, so take your sandwich to go and eat under the sun! Ps. The banana bread is really good if you're tempted to add a sweet treat to your coffee order."}
{"text":"Excellent meatball sandwich. I eat there often. The delightful smell of sandwiches tickled our hunger. Great place if you want lunch on the go.  They'll make sure to get your order ready ASAP. Also, sandwiches are monstrously huge, best meatball sandwich in the city combines a San Pietro ciabatta with San Marzano sauce, provolone and delicately seasoned and sauce-poached veal polpette."}
{"text":"I didn't love the vegetarian sandwich I got, which was bland (the veg pate had no flavor) and came on dull multigrain bread. But my companion really loved his meatball sandwich. That, a cool space attached to a men's clothing store and friendly staff add up to a four-star review."}
{"text":"Took my team here for our end of year lunch - service was friendly and just the right amount of attention.  Was nice that they had 3 options on the Table d'Hote for $21 - I had the cannelloni as did most of my team - portion size was just right and everyone used the bread to wipe their plates clean of all the delicious sauce !"}
{"text":"Phenomenal coffee, simply put. I am so happy to have this joint in St-Henri, close to me. Best coffee in the area. I love getting the iced latte, no sugar for $4. The best part? Getting your coffee to go and chilling in the awesome park nearby or walking to the Canal Lachine. *Only accepts debit cards or cash though grrr."}
{"text":"Pour un bon lunch santé, je vous conseille les excellentes salades de Campanelli. Le  contenu est savoureux, frais et on ne reste pas sur notre faim! J'aime beaucoup la caprese avec roquette, bocconcini, tomates, huile d'olive et vinaigrette balsamique. Demandez du  prosciutto en extra pour un max de protéines. Le café est aussi à essayer.  Je vous conseille de prendre votre lunch pour emporter car c'est assez petit."}
{"text":"Yum, I heart this place... The old Brodino, and in my new hood!"}
{"text":"Great little café! Very cute set-up, good (and affordable!!) coffee, and the sandwiches are delicious. Their meatball sandwich is awesome !"}
{"text":"Not much reviews for this place so I thought I would add a voice. After all, I'm there once a week for sure! It's coffee and pastries only these days, which means both are damn perfect. Chill & no frills. I always order the mocha and it pleases me A LOT. Perfect balance of the bitterness of the coffee and cacao powder. Depending on which barista is working, there's a small difference in the preparation of the beverages and it charms me. Also, muffins are made and baked on location and flavors change everyday. If you happen to catch the mocha or the orange-chocolate flavor, it makes for a sweet pairing :)

+ They have a New Yorker subscription!"}
{"text":"Vous avez été trop paresseux pour vous faire un sandwich à emmener avec vous pour le lunch? Ne vous inquiétez pas, Campanelli est là pour vous! Faits sur demande, les sandwiches du Campanelli font partis des meilleurs en ville. Rien de trop compliqué mais des ingrédients frais, des combinaisons à l'italienne, et du pain frais, frais, frais. Des choix de salades sont aussi disponibles. En y entrant, vous aurez possiblement de la difficulté à résister les muffins et le pain au banane-chocolat puisque quand le four fonctionne, l'odeur de ces délices remplie la place en entier. Le seul hic de l'endroit est que même s'ils font de très bons cafés, il n'y a pas beaucoup de place pour s'y asseoir et le savourer. Il y a des petits comptoirs le long du mur avec des chaises comme celles qu'on voit le long d'un bar, mais aucunes petites tables ordinaires pour s'y asseoir. Profitez-en plutôt pour commander votre lunch puis allez vous écraser dans la parc à deux pas de là. Parfait pour revirer les journées qui n'ont pas commencées du bon pied!"}
{"text":"Bon café. Bons sandwichs. Bonnes soupes. Bon service. Prix un peu élevé. Style un peu hipster, mais pas trop."}
