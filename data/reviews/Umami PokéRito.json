{"text":"I went for the first time a few days ago. I got an Umami bowl and it was excellent. The man behind the counter could tell by how long I was reading the board that it was my first time there and he explained everything to me. Food was delicious. Service was great. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Very friendly service and quick to pick up orders. It's my to go place for a quick Japanese meal~!"}
{"text":"Sushi burritos?? Amazing! Fish is fresh, tasty sauces. Try the soy wrap for less carbs and great flavor. Def coming back!"}
{"text":"We loved it! The place is small and it's fast casual dining, much like all the other Poké spots that have opened up in the area. The portion size is right for the price and it was absolutely delicious! I wish there was a little more space to sit and enjoy the food, but we were able to make room at the high top bar in the front window. I look forward to going back and I highly recommend the zen bowl with mixed greens!"}
{"text":"After visiting twice in one week, I can confirm that the 70 Yelpers who left an average 5.0 rating before me were correct; this poke restaurant is top notch.  The staff are always quite friendly, the facility is spotless clean, the seafood is fresh and more flavorful than some of the other poke places I've tried.  This will be my new go-to place for a quick and healthful  lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The owner Chef Lou was very nice! He is passionate about what he does. Charlotte is definitely going to love this place  

Presentation and taste was definitely there. I recommend that everyone should give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Fresh, fast, fantastic.  Been waiting for this place to open for awhile and it did not disappoint.  They are slightly short staffed and the drink selection is very limited but what they do, they do it well."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! If you like hand rolls and you like sushi rolls in general, this is an awesome mesh of the 2. Super fresh fish and seaweed salad was great. Definitely going back. And you don't have to wait forever like you do at other nearby sushi places. Winner!"}
{"text":"I went to two other poke restaurants in this area and honestly Umami is probably my favorite. I love their sauces and I think there's a better portion size."}
{"text":"This was so delicious! It had amazing flavor. I had the Umami bowl and I would strongly recommend it to basically everyone. The miso soup is also really yummy! The portions were really good for the price and I can't wait to come back. The service was friendly and helpful. They talk you through the menu and are more than happy to give suggestions. Super awesome place!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, food is good, management is attentive to any issue, and it's unique. Great healthy lunch or dinner. I'm really happy they moved into the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Yum! This was my first poke bowl experience and I loved it. Very much a fast casual restaurant with very quick service. I went on a Saturday evening and it wasn't all that busy. The gentleman who took my order was very friendly and efficient. I had one of their signature poke bowls (Umami bowl) as well as some miso soup and seaweed salad. Everything tastes great and seemed very fresh! My food was made extremely fast and I was in and out very quickly. Agree with other reviews there is not a lot of seating. Definitely good for a to-go option!"}
{"text":"One of the best Poke bowl places I've eaten at in a while. Highly suggest giving this place and try. Also, the place that work their are super friendly and the inside is very clean which is a plus."}
{"text":"My wife I & our two boys had dinner here tonight and it's was absolutely amazing!!  Our kids had chicken teriyaki on white rice, I had the Umami burrito and wife had the spicy miso chicken bowl.  Our boys loved the teriyaki chicken - not too bold for kids.  We loved the combination of flavors and portion size is perfect... satisfying without feeling overly stuffed.  Staff & owner extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  Owner did say they are working on adding more seating however the theme is more of a \"food to go\" type.  Very cozy & laid back family friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My dream come true!!!  I have been once and could eat there daily!  I had the umami burrito style and it was amaze!!!  Can't wait to go back.  I love the community style tables too.  An utter gem!"}
{"text":"I love sushi. I love burritos. So there was a pretty good chance that I was going to like this place. And I did. Obviously. 

Umami - you have yourself a new fan!

I decided to build my own burrito. But there are plenty of great combinations that would be good for someone less adventurous or that wants to keep it simple. 

The ordering is easy - you pick your protein, up to 5 toppings, add sauces and then you're done. 

I decided to have the spicy crab and loaded it up with toppings and added some yum yum sauce. Guys, it was so good! I did a pretty darn good job. 

The service here is very good, they gave me a tip for how to eat my burrito so it wouldn't fall apart and came by to make sure that I enjoyed everything. 

I'm already looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Came in for dinner with 3 kids and 4 adults and it was the first time we had ever been here. The staff was really nice and helpful explaining everything to us and helping us to make our selections. The food came out really fast and tasted delicious the portions size was on point and we can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Wow! That's good Japanese food! What could be better than fresh seafood that comes prepared by the hands of a sushi chef? 
This place is my new favorite joint! 
Come one, come all! This is the bomb!"}
{"text":"First time and definitely will not be the last time! Completely & totally stuffed! I took my whole family to try out a take on one of my favorite foods. I really didn't know what to expect. I was definitely not disappointed. The preparation was delicious. The presentation was phenomenal & the food was perfection. Fresh flavors, delicious crunch to the vegetables, great taste to the sauces! I am a new fan & this will definitely be my new go to spot. The ahi tuna & crab were fresh & the shrimp had its natural sweetness. I would definitely recommend adding all the veggies you can & tempura flakes for crunch. The texture goes a long way. Also, the staff were so helpful in helping us make choices & were definitely patient with my crew as we navigated the menu. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was in the area for work and decided to see how the folks up here do poke.  I have had poke on several occasions in my home state of Florida.  The pros: friendly staff, fresh ingredients
The cons: pricey for the amount of food received, limited toppings -- with surcharges for adding additional items.
It was not the best poke experience I have had and I have no reference in the Charlotte area, but in Florida, this spot would be meh.

Probably will not return."}
{"text":"This is exactly what this area needs! You want something good, go to this place. Create a bowl of sashimi and vegetables, or have it in a wrap. Do you like it spicy, then have it that way. Do you want steak instead of raw fish, go ahead. The place is perfectly suited for anyone's palate, but you have to know your flavor range. Spicy, bitter, sweet, tangy, etc.. They have it all. We've been several times and every single time, the dining area was spotless, no fish odors, and nothing messed up. The staff is courteous, helpful, interactive, and clean. Even if you're not adventurous, you should give it a go because they'll help you find something you can try...and it may end up helping you become more adventurous. We absolutely love this place. Support local businesses and restaurants!!"}
{"text":"I happened upon this place randomly and just HAD to check it out. I am so glad that I did. The poke burrito I had was delicious and fresh. I wish the portion size was a little larger for the price but otherwise it was perfect. The owner was very nice. I will be back. No place like it in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I had been waiting for months for this place to open. Slightly getting frustrated it was taking so long, but oh my goodness, it was worth every month I waited! The poké bowls are so delicious and the sushi burritos amazing! I have already been twice in one week and am most likely going back this week. Delicious and I love that I can make my own bowl!"}
{"text":"First time was pretty good. I made my own chicken rice bowl. It came with a choice of vegetables and a topping. Sauces are an extra 50 cents each. The umami burrito looked delicious it had a decent amount of fish inside. Miso soup was also good but small. 

Downsides are that seating is limited. The seats are metal stools with no back support. There is also a slim drink selection. They have bottled and tap water, unsweetened tea, hot tea, an uncarbonated soft drink and canned milk coffee. 

Overall will be back again because we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"We were visiting my friend in Charlotte and, bound by babies who have early bedtimes, decided to order takeout from Umami at my friend's recommendation. I have pretty high expectations for my sushi and was very pleasantly surprised at how fresh and tasty everything was!

My sister and I each got the Umami bowl (normally we'd get two different things to try/share each but the Umami bowl just looked so good, we couldn't resist). I was picking between that and zen because I really wanted shrimp tempura so just ordered a kid's order of shrimp tempura, gave some to my blw 10 month old and ate most of her shrimp :-P -- SO GOOD and surprisingly filling! My sister couldn't finish her bowl and I normally scarf poke bowls down and it was plenty of food.

For the price, how fresh the food was and convenience -- really can't be beat. Now I just need to find a similarly awesome place near takeout/delivery range of my house in ATL and I'll be one happy clam."}
{"text":"Really happy to see a restaurant like this in Charlotte! Service was great, they're were nice and I got my food in about 5 mins after ordering. 

I ordered a Spicy Mexican Sushi bowl to go. The portion was filling and very yummy!"}
{"text":"My first time EVER having a sushi burrito and I must say it was THE MOST DELICIOUS THING EVER!!! The menu is pretty straight forward and they also have a build your own option as well. The only thing i will say is, drink options are limited. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic! We came specifically for Lou, followed him from Vegas! Absolutely delicious! He made a special order for me of my favorite Vegas roll into a bowl, perfection! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had the grilled shrimp poké bowl and it was pretty good! I'd say it was one of the best poké bowls I've had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"To adequately explain how delicious this food is can only be attempted but you must try it to judge for yourself ! 

The Zen bowl is a delicious and has quickly become a favorite of mine. I find myself saying things over and over like, \"Oh my God \" & \"this is so good \" ! 
The shrimp tempura along with crab & spicy tuna are a palatable delight! 
I think I love this place ...."}
{"text":"Good friendly service nice staff but I'm not sure why this place has 5 Stars.. the bowl I ordered wasn't nearly enough for the price of it.. plus I didn't get full and It was cold. Its not a place I would go back to but I'm glad I was able to check it out!"}
{"text":"Love this place, I think I've been a total of 5 times now since they opened and keep bringing someone new with me to try it. They are super friendly and already know me there. I've tried 3 of their signature rolls/bowls and I've built my own. I have yet to be disappointed. My favorite so far was probably the tuna poké bowl. The only negative about the place is the limited seating that others have mentioned, but to be honest, the only time I have not been able to sit somewhere was on opening day (thanks to a group that was way past done eating but continued to hog the table!!! So frustrating when there isn't extra seating). Anyways, they definitely earn 5 stars and the price is right for a healthy, fresh, and good portion. My husband was surprised the rice wasn't hot but I didn't even notice... He also still thought his bowl was delicious. He doesn't like fish so he got the chicken with teriyaki sauce and loved the flavor."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Great Miso and the Poke Salad was awesome!  Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"We went 1st time yesterday and loved it so much, we returned to pick up lunch today as well. Fresh fish, friendly staff and great location. The only downside is limited amount of seats. I feel like they have to reorganize table positioning a little bit."}
{"text":"Wife and I enjoyed our first trip here.  Our burritos were delicious.  In all we got 3 differnet burritos, 2 miso soups, and 2 cans of the Calipico."}
{"text":"Awesome !!!
Perfect place if you prefer healthy food, price for burrito is not so high, you can get your own wrap, order was really fast we waited only few minutes, I believe not more than 5- that's was surprise. All ingredients is fresh and organic, cook was so friendly and nice. Just one recommendation add more different drinks to menu. Thanks, I'll see you again."}
{"text":"A very popular place to go to, and I would agree.

The customer service was excellent and patient when we try to determine our order.

The food was fresh and very delicious.

The restaurant was very busy and it did take a little while for us to get our seats.

The only reason it was mark down one star was because they did not give us the correct order.

They did replace it, and the replacement was good as well.

Overall I highly recommend a place to go and I would recommend it if you enjoy the sushi burrito."}
{"text":"The poke at this place has to be the best in the Carolinas. Exquisite cuisine and for a poke place it is super high in quality and freshness. 

Lou is a proven chef and a very personable guy who knows what's he's doing. Incredible visionary who's open to suggestions to improve the product. It's very nice to see West coast ideas move to Charlotte. We don't live close but it's definitely worth the short drive out. Will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Love this place! I got a Sushi burrito and it was the best. The have the best service as well."}
{"text":"If you can imagine Chipotle and a high-end sushi restaurant got together and made a new restaurant, it would be the best way to describe the latest 'fast-casual' trend that's sweeping the nation.

I really didn't walk in here thinking I was going to love the \"Poké\" concept. Not that I had anything against it, but I've seen so many fads come and go that I wasn't sure if this was just the next \"Anti-Griddle Ice Cream\" or \"Customize your own pizza!\" Nope, this was something else alright, something much more refined and delicious.

When you walk into Umami, it's very minimalist. Maybe a bit too much as seating is very limited. At first glance, it appears that they anticipate that most customers will take their meal to-go. And after trying for the first time, it's a perfect to-go option! I still probably wouldn't mind eating in every once an awhile, just be warned that a half dozen or so customers and this place is pretty full. One more note on the inside, the bathrooms have been spotless the three times I've been here, wonderful!

So I have gotten the Umami Bowl twice and the Tuna Poké bowl once and I gotta say, the Umami Bowl is the perfect proportions of everything. The Spicy Crab could be a bit spicier if you ask me, but I just love how everything, down to the perfectly cooked/ cooled rice is so balanced and complements all the other components. The salmon in this bowl is top notch. The thick fat layers stand out beautifully and the texture is better than most sushi restaurants in town. All of this is really rounded out well with a slightly sweet \"yum yum sauce\", mellow avacado, and just the right amount bitterness with the mixed greens. I highly suggest getting this bowl as-is if it's your first time here.

My only minor complaint would be that the drink options are awfully limited, and only bottled offerings with high markups. If you are taking your meal to-go I would suggest to buy your beverage beforehand.

As far as the rest of the menu, I must say that I'm going to have to force myself to try new things as they have me hooked on the Umami Bowl. Can't wait to try bowl after bowl on their extensive menu with varying hints of cuisines!"}
{"text":"Delighted with happy belly! Fresh fish and right amount of sweet/savory sauce blends. Generous portions for a reasonable price. I tried miso soup, shishito peppers and the squid salad which were delicious and the Umami sushi bowl over brown rice. You can dine in or takeout for quick fix. Decor is clean and zen. Staff was friendly and efficient. Chef even greeted us and made sure things were done right. Will definitely go back and try other menu items."}
{"text":"We went with a build your own poke bowl & an Umami Bowl. Drinks were a weird limited assortment, so we both went with Acqua Panna (Huge Italian sparkling water in glass bottles). The fish was not as fresh as I'd hoped and the rice was a hard disappointing puck at the bottom of the bowl.  You had to use your chopsticks like an ice pick to free up the rice from their cold rigormortis. While we ate beside another couple at a communal table (whyyy!?!) we watched as the three guys behind the counter fumbled around in confusion. The food took entirely too long to come out for us and everyone else there. I wanted to love this place, I'd been following their progress for months on Facebook.  I grew disheartened each time their opening was pushed back again and again. Maybe they'll get their act together eventually. For us, there were too many different things wrong with this place and nothing worth going back for."}
{"text":"Wow wow, first time trying this and we were not disappointed. My boyfriend got the spicy Mexican sushi burrito and I got the zen bowl. Yummyyyy! Service was fast and the guy taking orders was super nice. Zen bowl is definitely my favorite. (for now) 
the location is small, with only 2 tables to share. So if you're going in a big group just know you might not be able to eat inside. Everything is plated in to-go boxes though. Which I have no problem with. Found the to-go boxes really cute and easy to eat from. oh oh I also got the seaweed salad which was by far the best I've had in a while. Can't wait to try other locations. (was told each location has different styles)"}
{"text":"Fresh, fast, healthy, customizable. I am obsessed! 

My family lives near the Carmel Commons area and we eagerly awaited Umami PokeRito's opening. It did not disappoint. 

Choose from set bowls or build your own. I tried Seoul Poke Bowl in South End a few weeks ago - and felt Umami's proteins and ingredients were higher quality. Both are delicious options (don't get me wrong) and healthy alternatives to mayo laden sushi rolls. Same flavor without the fat.

My mom and I split three different bowls: the Sunrise, Tuna Poke and veg-friendly tofu bowl. We loved the peanut sauce on the tofu option. The sunrise had an amazing pickled daikon topping. She and I fought over the last bite! I was also a fan of the seaweed salad accompanying the tuna bowl. We could not pick a favorite - everything made for a delicious balance of fishy goodness! 

I echo the similar anecdotes from reviewers on customer service. The owner and workers are incredibly kind, grateful and friendly. They walked us through menu items, answered questions with ease and were genuinely thrilled to serve us.

Umami PokeRito will definitely be a staple in my family's takeout rotation. Love it!"}
{"text":"Aaaaaaah man.  Super fresh sushi.  Had the poke salad, miso soup, edamame, Umami Bowl (highly recommend) and the spicy chicken miso. 

And VERY good customer service.  I ordered a poke bowl without knowing there was mango (which I am allergic to). They gave us another bowl on the house. 

We don't live near but will make time to come back.  Yummmmm"}
{"text":"Loved this place!!! The staff are so friendly and helpful. They have chicken and beef options along with your usual sushi favorites.  I got the zen \"burrito\" light spicy tuna, extra spicy crab, with soy paper, no chipotle aioli, sweet soy sauce on the side.  It was so yummy and waaay too much food for one sitting! My husband travels to San Francisco often and loves the poke bowl experience.  This was my first try and I really enjoyed it!  Give this place a try!!! There really is something for everyone!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The owner was very friendly and super helpful since it was my first time having a poke bowl. He explained what everything was and gave me samples of anything I wanted to try and made recommendations for my bowl...and it was DELICIOUS!! He said they get all of their fish from Hawaii and everything tasted super fresh. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places! Every time I go, the food is fresh and the service good. Great pick"}
{"text":"Love this place! Chris was extremely helpful and helped me with my order. I've had the bowl and burrito and both were delicious! Very flavorful and this will be my new Poke spot:)"}
{"text":"Went to Unami for the 1st time. Used to live in Cali and a frequent visitor to Hawaii AND I am so happy Charlotte has a good option for us Pike Bowl lovers. The employees were very friendly, the service was great and the food was spot on. Now to be clear, nothing can touch a fresh poke bowl from the islands. Unami gives my wife and I a local resource and we definitely will be back again!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Super fresh food, wonderful staff, and prices MUCH better than another poke place in the area. The tuna tacos were hands down the best ive had in NC. This is my new go to lunch place!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place - good service, and great presentation. The bowl tasted alright but a weird taste from one of the fish that was mixed in there. Could have just been the sauce, and I was fine after. Their wraps and other items on the menus looked good as well!"}
{"text":"Seriously this place is awesome ! The sushi burrito has to be the greatest fusion I've ever had in my life ... being a sushi addict this place just makes me sooo happy! And the staff, specially the cashier, is always nice and welcoming... there's not one single thing I don't love about this place !!"}
{"text":"I have been so excited and patiently waiting for this place to open since I love Poké! They did not disappoint! I got the Sunrise burrito and my husband got the Tuna Poke burrito. They both tasted amazing and the portion sizes were great! We also got the squid salad that was good as well. 

I do wish they had a more child friendly menu--perhaps some regular white rice and some chicken or something. And I agree with the other review--they have a very sparse amount of seating but they do have a sign saying they are working on adding more seats! I highly recommend this place! And I'm so happy poké is becoming more popular!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Tastes super fresh and everything is prepared with great ingredients. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ive been looking for a good poke spot in Charlotte for a while and finally found it. Great food and the staff was very friendly. Highly recomend it."}
{"text":"My sister, niece and I came here for lunch today and it did not disappoint! Like the previous review said it's like a chipotle but for sushi! I thoroughly enjoyed my sushi-rito and so did my niece! My sister got a sushi bowl and it was also delicious! There is a great variety of fresh items to choose from in personalizing your meal or you can also go with some of their chefs specials. You can't go wrong with what ever option you decide. I can't wait to tell all my sushi loving friends about this place!"}
{"text":"Not as flavorful as I had expected.. portion could be a little more generous.. they charge .50 cents for extra sauce.. would go again and try a sushi burrito.."}
{"text":"Sushi lover first time with a sushi burrito. This place nails it. Food is super fresh and flavorful with a nice variety of options (either chef specials or build your own like I did) to please my demanding palette. Poke sauce was incredible. They even provided me an off menu chili sauce because I wanted a lot of spice. My mouth is still watering thinking about it the day after, almost went back for lunch. Really nice staff and the place is spotless and minimalist with good ambiance for fast casual. It feels authentic, not chain-like. The owner brings what apparently west coast people have been enjoying for years to Charlotte - thank you!"}
{"text":"I found this place on accident when I was going to smoothie king in the same plaza. I'm so glad i did. I am a huge fan on sushi, poké, anything with seafood really. I've tried other places in charlotte and have been disappointed. Umami is well worth the prices. Everything had flavor, i didn't have to worry about my rice being dry or my spicy tuna being bland. I would for sure recommend people to try them out. All of the workers I encountered were so kind and funny. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Ahhh Poké!!! A fantastic and relatively inexpensive way to get your sushi fix! This was my first visit to Umami Poké Rito, the staff is friendly and informative with the menu. This restaurant is very clean, the to-go utensils station is neat and organized. There's plenty of parking available in this shopping center. 

If you're not familiar with Poké, there are other options available (vegetarian included). Just a heads up there are No Substitutions allowed with the Chef Signature menu items.

 I choose to Build my own Poké Bowl,  my selection included:
- Mixed Greens
- Spicy Crab & Spicy Tuna 
- Avacado  (no additional charge! omg)
- cucumber
-Carrot
- Jalapeno
- Red onion
- Seaweed Salad
- Cilantro
-  The signature Poke Sauce (So Good)

Next time i'm going for the burrito!!"}
{"text":"Very interesting! I will definitely be back. 

My only complaints would be the over-chlorinated water (tap), and all of the sauce was at the ends of the burrito. 

You can get a build your own burrito for less than 10, but I suspect the preselected ingredients would make for a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"I am so excited and glad that charlotte is getting a good taste of umami! Usually places like this only exists in highly diverse cities.
With that said, the sushi burrito i had was quite good, i only wish it had a bit more protein. I understand proteins are expensive, but i'd rather they charge $1 more or cut the nice bag with handle for takeout, and the plastic sushi takeout container. I think just a simple brown bag stamped with the restaurant's name, phone and address would have been adequate and effective. Plus, you have such a cool concept, why not market it? People can see me eating a sushirito and know where to get it themselves! Since the burrito is already wrapped well, there is no need for the extra sushi container.  Right now, the sushi burrito doesn't quite taste like a hand roll, it's too diluted. It leans more towards the flavor of a burrito. I would think it'd be better to lean more towards the taste of a hand roll to separate itself from chipotle and qdoba, don't get me wrong, even the set up of the restaurant looks like a chipotle/qdoba.
Also the restaurant could do a better job of explaining what each of the japanese terminologies are, this would not only make the customer experience better, but make service faster.
Lastly, the restaurant needs more seats, rather than the two big tables inside, i think they could place more small 2 people tables throughout, and then if there are parties with more than 2, they can put the tables together. 
I will be back to try out their bowl, with some tweaks, this restaurant can definitely be 5 stars."}
{"text":"I was super excited to go here but was slightly disappointed, every sauce is an up charge and the spicy tuna wasn't my favorite. I'd go back but order differently !"}
{"text":"I had my first ahi tuna bowl today and it was phenomenal! The prices are fantastic and the quality of the ahi tuna was amazing, as was my SO's salmon. I will certainly be coming back, maybe tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm. One day I felt like getting some not cooked fish with rice wrapped in a seaweed burrito. My sushi burrito tasted just as fresh as if I had jumped off a boat and killed a fish with a spear. Mmmm. Fish. Gotta love it...10/10 experience. Mmm. Sushi is good :)"}
{"text":"Yum. I've been eyeing this place for a while. I came in for a late lunch so there was no surprise they weren't busy at all. I'm really curious how it looks during lunch time. There are two large tables, seats by the cooking area and some by the window. 

 I took my time viewing the menu and I decided to BYOB. I picked spicy beef as my protein with sushi white rice. I had red onions, cilantro, roasted corn and green onions with kimchi with a side of wasabi aioli sauce. We placed our order and sat down by the window. We didn't wait long at all. The food tasted really fresh. The beef was very good and tender. The toppings were good and added a nice texture with the rice. I wasn't crazy about the wasabi aioli but that's also because I don't really like wasabi. I asked the girl at the counter a suggestion and she suggested that. It wasn't a big deal, I was actually happy with it being as is. My husband loved his bowl and he did the BYOB as well. My only little suggestion is for better plastic silverware. The fork was constantly bending and it was super hard to try to get everything and it was hard to cut my steak with the knife since it was also bending back and forth. Other than that, I really have no complaints!"}
{"text":"Not one negative thing to say! Service was quick, portion size was perfect, and price was on point. We started with the Squid salad which was delicious. I got the Unami bowl and my boyfriend got the Zen bowl, both were amazing! Ingredients all tasted very fresh. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really unique and amazing food experience here in CLT.  I ate here with my girlfriend and we kind of did a menu tasting.  We shared the tuna tacos, Tahitian shrimp salad, tuna roll, and chomex roll.  We were blown away about how perfect the flavor profiles complimented each other.  The tuna tacos were crispy, salty, smoky, and full of umami.  The won ton type shells were not greasy at all like many restaurants mess up.  

The Tahitian shrimp salad was fantastic, it was perfectly balanced lightly sweet, tangy mango, rich shrimp, and a nice savory bite from the onion. The tuna roll and chomex roll had perfect ingredients to tie in all the flavors and textures.  I was really blown away by the mix of textures and flavors.  Also, the quality of fish really stood out compared to anything I've had in the Charlotte sushi scene.  I think we are lucky to have a place like this in CLT, I hope they open more locations.  

Run don't walk to try this place, the lines are worth the wait!"}
{"text":".  Let me start by saying I am obsessed with sushi. Like wake up with a hangover still craving sushi. I can not believe it took me this long to try a sushi burrito!!!! 

What you need to know:
This was good sushi. It tasted fresh and was good quality and quantity. 
I got a build your own burrito. Maybe being my first time I should have let the experts build it for me but I still was not disappointed. Ingredients included: seaweed wrap with brown rice, salmon, spicy crab, carrots, spring mix, avocado, cucumber, scallions, and seaweed salad. Served with yum yum and lemon ponzu sauce. It was the bomb!! Like a cross between a Summer roll and sushi roll! I felt like I got my money's worth and won't be hungry in an hour. 

Only down side is that it did get a little messy at the end of the burrito but I've never shied away from a messy meal. Especially when it's this good. 

I would definitely recommend for a quick meal!"}
{"text":"I haven't even tasted the food yet but I am giving them 5 stars because I worked 12 hours today and I slid in 2 minutes before they closed. The man at the counter was very hospitable and didn't rush me out the door. I can appreciate the customer service. I am sure it's delicious because  I could see that the ingredients were fresh. Stop in and see them."}
{"text":"Amazing Poké for the price.. fresh ingredients.. owner is happy to explain the menu and they have online ordering options now."}
{"text":"My first time having a pokerito and it was amazing. The owner is really friendly and gave really good recommendations. The food was delicious. The shrimp appetizer with the coconut sauce was amazing. If you're a sushi lover, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"First and definitely not the last sushi burrito for me! The employees were super helpful at answering all of my annoying questions about unfamiliar ingredients and helping me choose which combo to try. I got the burrito with salmon and crab in it- can't remember the name. But I really don't think you could go wrong with any of the pre-made combos they have! There isn't much seating inside so it probably isn't the best for a sit down place, just take out."}
{"text":"YAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSS!!!!! FINALLY A POKE AND SUSHI BURRITO PLACE IN CHARLOTTE!!!!! I can't tell you how long I've waited for these guys to open and ohhhhh boyyyy was I NOT disappointed! The food came out fast and the service was great. Not to mention the food was  fresh and delish! 

Now a few pointers for the future since they're still new: I wish they'd offer a regular and large size bowl (for those with a bigger appetite.. uh me haha) and more seating. We had to wait for people to leave and sat next to strangers. Oh also, it'd be nice if there were a soda fountain machine too. It was kinda odd having a limited drinks selection with unfamiliar names

The ambiance is great and definitely making this place our go-to place for our sushi fix. The staff is super friendly and the variety is fairly large and fairly priced. You'll definitely be seeing a lot of me at this place!"}
{"text":"A pleasant unexpected find! Super fresh and super delicious! Very clean place with friendly staff. Will be back again."}
{"text":"It's easy to see why this place is rated 5 stars. It has everything to make it  exactly what you want and expect.

Location is great. Plenty of parking. The interior of the store is nicely decorated and clean. Food selection is plentiful and tasty. There is always the option of build your own if you wish. Prices are reasonable (prices are higher than a typical lunch might be, but this is fair given the type of cuisine available here). There is only one size of serving (probably a medium bowl) but it is enough to satisfy even the hungriest appetite. Service is friendly, fast and polite.

All points touched are a '5'. What's not to love?!"}
{"text":"Great food and service; the sushi is fresh prices are reasonable.  I love the sushi bowl ahi tuna and salmon with wasabi sauce... best in town"}
{"text":"The sushi burritos are sooooo good. I have only ordered the Umami burrito (with tempura shrimp added). Just so fresh and good. VERY filling. 

The staff is incredibly friendly and patient! It's also very clean and welcoming. 

My only negative comment is about the seats. Not a place you'd want to hang out in for an extended period as the stools are not overly comfortable. Doesn't stop us from going though. :-)"}
{"text":"This is our favorite spot in Charlotte! We love the food - it's amazing and fresh, but more importantly we love the service. They are extremely fast and always provide a wonderful meal. We love the variety of ingredients and how healthy and tasty this mean is. The owner is welcoming and helpful and always puts the customer first. We are so happy that Umami Pokerita is close to our house because we visit so frequently!  Our go to: the shishito peppers (they don't disappoint!) and the Umami bowl."}
{"text":"Delish! Definitely get the bowl over the burrito and ask about all of the yummy sauces they offer  if you're confused, just ask for a recommendation from the staff, they won't steer you wrong"}
{"text":"Stopped in hereafter a workout session in the same shopping center and I must say that I think Umami Poke'Rito is the best Poke' in Charlotte. Had what I'd call a make your own Poke wrap - wrapped up in Nori/seaweed with salmon and all the fixings. So yummy, I think I'll go back again tomorrow."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open! It finally did and it's a great spot for a PokeRito. Or as I have been calling it, Sushiritto. Whatever you call it, this is exactly what you want! Seating is limited but it's just as good to go. Very easy to eat while out and about as it comes wrapped like a wrap or burrito. I am always looking for a quick bite that's not unhealthy. This fits the bill perfectly!"}
{"text":"So let me just start by saying we(me and my fellow foodie at work) were looking for something to eat today and wanted something new.  We wanted sushi but were a little burnt out on our favorite spot Mr. Tokyo. I looked for something close that did takeout and stimbled upon this little gem.

Now I've heard of poke, but never went out to try it and and always thought pokeritos were going to be a bit overwhelming and was just a fad so I avoided it.

Boy was I wrong. I called in a build your own bowl and burrito for my friend and it was ready in about 10 minutes to pickup.

You can view the menu to see the options to customize the bowl, it was exciting to pick what I wanted like this. The chef reccomended the sushi rice as he said it was most popular, and I went with the Ahi Tuna because raw was on my mind.  I had it mixed with 5 items: mixed greens, jalapeno, red cabbage, tempura flakes and cilantro. Then I had it topped with seaweed salad and their in-house poke sauce. It looked amazing like the best salad I've ever gotten, for takeout I knew I was in for a treat. I mixed in a little of the offered soy sauce and wasabi and went to town.

You wanna talk about fresh? It was a foodies wetdream. The tuna was so flavorful and melted in my mouth and the combination of other flavors just meshed together perfectly. They really are on point with their sushi rice, some the best I have ever had. The whole bowl is eatable using chopsticks which was a major plus for me.

The sauce added so much unique flavor and combined with the soy and seasoning of the seaweed salad I was in heaven.

My buddy got a soy paper wrap with spicy tuna, seaweed salad, poke sauce and similiar items as my bowl and got one for his son who also works with us and they were both impressed so I'll definitely reccomend and try it next time.
We brought menus for some coworkers and the whole office was jealous and wanted to try it from looks alone and everyone said it smelled amazing.

Me and my friend both agreed these gentelman know what they are doing and have it down pat. This is definitely going to be a weekly lunch spot for us now.

Bravo gentlemen, bravo."}
{"text":"This was amazing! My husband's and my first time trying poke. The restaurant is a little small and doesn't have many seating options, but it is contemporary and simple. 

The staff was friendly and very open to helping us find something on the menu to suit us. They made suggestions for \"first time poke eaters.\" 

My husband got the Spicy Miso Chicken Bowl with brown rice and loved it. He's a picky eater and loved the flavors. I went for the Tuna Poke Bowl. Portions were generous, and my goodness! The flavors and textures were amazing. I wanted to eat 2 more bowls after I finished mine. 

I went in intending to get the PokéRito, but the friendly staff member recommended the bowl to really be able to taste the filling. He explained that with certain orders, you sacrifice fillings for rice. I appreciated his suggestion on that and see how the PokéRito is more of a novelty. 

We'll definitely go back for a fun lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I had the zen bowl and it was as absolutely amazing. My wife got the Komex bowl and she also loved it. The bowls at first glance seem a bit small but they are packed with flavor and completely fill you up. If you are planning on eating at the restaurant go at a non-peak time as there really isn't very much as far as seating in the restaurant. If you love sushi except no substitutes."}
{"text":"The best poke place in Charlotte/Pineville hands down! Love the place this definitely recommend going there"}
