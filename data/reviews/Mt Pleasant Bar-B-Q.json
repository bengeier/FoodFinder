{"text":"Pleasant person on the phone. Order was ready when I got there. Ribs were great. The sauce was just a tad runny, but had a great flavor.  Reasonable price of $11.25."}
{"text":"This place sucks monkey ass! Do not go to this restaurant to save your life!!! Horrible customer service. Order was incorrect when I called back to ask for credit or refund the staff was very argumentative instead of just fixing it right."}
{"text":"Hate to say it, but Mt pleasant Ribs really disappointed me today.  Ordered a slab and a half.  The meat was tasteless, tough, and stringy.  Nothing tasty.  The sauce was watery and neither sweet nor tangy. The fries were tasteless and over cooked.  Not coming back until I hear things have improved dramatically."}
{"text":"So this place is a total dive, and it's in the HOOD. So I don't recommend going there at night like I did, haha. But the food is absolutely fantastic. I got a polish boy and a side of mac and cheese, and it was everything I could have wanted. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a professional chef born and raised in Cleveland. I'm currently working on the west coast. Whenever I'm home and I need a true BBQ experience from masters of their craft. This is the only place that will do. It's been around for generations. I've been eating here since I was a child and so has my mother. The food is amazing and the service is great and personable. This is Cleveland at its finest!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the Barbque shoulder and it really was good! This is thee spot round the way. It's not for you if you think you are at a five star! It's open for business unlike some"}
