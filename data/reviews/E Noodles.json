{"text":"Enoodles is the BOMB!  Hands down the best place in town.  Always fresh, always delicious, service is top notch!  The sush is amazing!!! 5*s!"}
{"text":"Delicious! On of our favorite spots. We started with appetizers: tempura vegetables and chicken lettuce wraps. For dinner I had sushi. The crispy spicy tuna roll and the dynamite roll were both delicious. The children enjoyed lo mein and spring rolls. The server was wonderful and the food came out in a good timely manner."}
{"text":"Singapore Curry Noodles are delicious. I lived in Asia for several years and found this item tasty."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend on a date here and we had a blast sitting outside, good food and good service all around"}
{"text":"Yeah agree with most reviews.  Nice to have a place like this in concord.   Excellent food.   Asian fusion.   Love the variety from Thai to Chinese Japanese and a splash of Korean.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place.   My wife and I go there regularly and are always treated to a quality meal and great service.   They are easily one of my top restaurants in the area.   If you are in the area stop on by and get the pad Thai and you will be pleasantly served.   If they happen to have the eggplant tempura special that they offer seasonally go for it and enjoy."}
{"text":"Another gem of a restaurant in Concord that we have been going to for years. The owners and staff go above and beyond with customers. Very clean place and the atmosphere along with the decor is relaxing. The new sushi bar is a great addition. They have accommodated our large parties with ease. The menu has many delicious dishes. I only wish there was more seating. That being said, it's still one of favorites that never lets us down."}
{"text":"It's a favorite!  Great atmosphere and owners. Pad Thai is my norm. They are consistent in the way it is fixed every time, which I like. And it is good.  However, it isnt the traditional way I am used to from the Pacific Northwest. I always order extra spicey and have enough for leftovers."}
{"text":"So so so Good . Had the fried potstickers . Also ordered the Nicole -la roll so delicious. Lisa was our server she was the best . I will be back many times to try more items . Definitely the best sushi place around ."}
{"text":"This is our go-to for date nights.  We have never been disappointed and at this point we've tried most everything on the menu.  The food is really really delicious.
Our favorites:  Shallot Tenderlon, Grouper Tempura, Hong Kong Wonton soup, Vietnamese Summer Rolls, spring rolls, and Pad Thai.
Service is quick.
Prices are reasonable. 
Drink specials are delicious.
Best place for a dinner date in Concord!"}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed with this place. The cocktails are delicious and the food is always fresh, unique and delicious. My favorite Asian place in Concord hands down"}
{"text":"I don't normally order sashimi unless I'm at a fresh seafood restaurant by the ocean. But I did here and it was amazing. It was so fresh and the speciality rolls were exploding with flavor. I would say this is my top 10 favorite sushi restaurants I've been to. Great service as well."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place...but alas, I didn't. I'm in town for work and found this place by searching for \"Vegetarian\" on Yelp. I read the reviews and then checked out the restaurant's website--while there really weren't a lot of vegetarian options on the menu it mentioned in several places that many dishes could be made vegetarian so I headed over with high hopes.

The place was packed at 7:30pm on a Tuesday night (a good sign!) so I was seated at the sushi bar...and promptly ignored or forgotten. The hostess offered to take my drink order but it was still between 5 and 10 minutes before anybody from the wait staff approached me. I inquired about vegetarian options for their noodle soups (what had enticed me there); the waiter assured me that they could do a bowl of noodles and vegetables. I asked about the broth (yes, I'm one of *those* picky ones who doesn't eat meat for philosophical reasons) and he admitted that the broth would be beef-based. Rats.

I ended up ordering the tempura asparagus fries (which I highly recommend) and an assortment of vegetarian sushi (which I don't...the nori wasn't toasted and was overwhelmingly fishy...or, I should say, seaweedy).

I'm disappointed and wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for take-out at first. We changed our minds and decided to dine-in. The restaurant did not seem to busy, but they did appear to be short-staffed at the time since the two waitresses that we saw were running around. Other customers appeared to be pleased with their meals, however we waited about ten or fifteen minutes for a waitress to come to our table and at least take our drink order, but no luck. We were pretty hungry, so we decided to just leave and go eat somewhere else. As we were walking out of the door, the waitress from our area asked if something was wrong and we explained the situation to her. I have heard great things about this restaurant, so I will likely be back to actually try it when they are less busy or have more staff on hand."}
{"text":"Best sushi and noodles in Concord. The ginger miso is my favorite. The service and location is wonderful as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorites!  Lots of variety of Asian food and good atmosphere.  I like the spicy udon noodles with shrimp, calamari, and scallops. Good drink selection and full bar if you have to wait for a table.  One of the best Asian restaurants in Concord."}
{"text":"I just don't get all great reviews.  Tried it for the second time, but this place just isn't good.  We ordered the shallot tenderloin which was bland with soggy vegetables.  Also ordered Korean Japchae noodles which was a gelatinous glob that we couldn't pry apart to eat.  They say 3rd time is a charm, but something tells me we won't have any luck at this place!"}
{"text":"Visiting on business and saw all the good reviews so I decided to try this place 

Restaurant was very busy.  Got a seat at the sushi bar right away.  Sever came over very quickly with a happy smile and took my drink order.  Returned quickly and I placed my order

Miso ginger ramen noodle bowl and a spicy tuna roll. 

Ramen bowl was full of nicely cook ramen chunks of pork and some veggies.    Very tasty !!!!

Spicy tuna Roll was good not the best I have had but not the worst.  

Service A+. Good A-

I would 100% go back and try some of there other choices from their big menu"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times before. This time I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai & it comes NOWHERE close to the Pad Thai I am in love with at Basil. I was disappointed with this dish; not much flavor & watered down. Although I will frequent this joint again, I will skip their Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Consistency is lacking.  It is often hit or miss, because sometimes the order does not come out as expected.  The wait staff does a pretty good job with keeping your drinks refreshed, but sometimes the wait staff is not the friendliest.  My family and I enjoy eating here because it is one of the better Asian food restaurants in the area.  I would definitely not recommend hosting a large party here, due to the restaurant's small amount of space.  Although, it is a good place to meet someone for lunch, because they have an extensive menu and are reasonably priced. 
*Lunch is a better deal than dinner, because the portions are about the same, but the lunch order includes a spring roll."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences you can have.
Freshly prepared dishes by excellent chefs with service by personable servers.
Owners are hands on and treat you like you are in their personal home.
Doesn't get any better for the price!"}
{"text":"Didn't even get to eat there since I got angry at the hostess while waiting and walked out. The place was packed inside and out. It did have live music which I don't enjoy in Charlotte small restaurant. The hostess should get her act together. She couldn't keep the guests in order or even remember the name of the party she just wrote down."}
{"text":"wonderful restaurant in Afton Village. amazing sushi. Nice outdoor patio"}
{"text":"Love this place.

It's hard to be unbiased when you work next door and eat at a place all the time but seriously, this place has got the goods. We're talking delicious. 

Favorites: Shallot Tenderloin, Pork Fried Rice, General Tso's Chicken so hot you'll blow your nose and your tissue will catch on fire.

This place is ALWAYS packed. The price is right. The staff is friendly and you always see the same faces, which I love. 

Closed for lunch on Saturday, which is a downer, but worth the wait for dinner time at 5:00!

An A+ recommendation, friends."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Not anymore. My friends arrived before us and already had a table. I asked for a larger table or to pull up the one next to us. 5 does not fit at a small 4 top. I was told we could have the 6 top when it opened. So I waited. When it opened, the waitress informed us her manager would not let us have the table. I asked to see the manager. She pointed out a table with a baby in a high chair and they were fine. That baby and the high chair were pulled away from the table. My son's high chai was pulled under the table so he could reach his food. I explained my son was older, was going to need a place setting. I ordered him an separate meal. I explained to the manager we did not have enough room and she said a reservation had that table. I could not even pull up to the table. No room for my legs due to the high chair being where my legs would go. Again a small 4 top table with 5 people. A toddler that eats a purchased meal is not a baby drinking a bottle. People kept hitting my chair since I was sitting out in the walk way. No one came in for the 6 top and a second 6 top opened up. I asked for my food to be put in a to go box since I couldn't get up the the table to eat. Everyone that saw me kept asking what was wrong and nothing was ever done to give me a seat at a table. I was not going to  hold the food in my lap while people hit my chair. No one ever sat at one of the larger tables. I finally went outside to stop getting hit. I told the hostess to thank the manager for me not getting place to eat my meal while 2 tables sat empty. I will never go back. I asked for a larger table at the beginning. Was lied to and unable to eat my dinner."}
{"text":"Best sushi and Asian cuisine in the Charlotte area. Best specialty rolls are the cowboy roll and nirvana roll. The maki rolls are great for variety and appetizers (BOGO half off on Thursdays). Usually very busy for dinner, so be prepared to wait. I've sampled most of the cuisine they offer (hibachi plates, noodle plates, soups, potstickers, etc.) and all have been very tasty. The owners have been there every time I've dined, and typically run the food or bring beer/wine to the tables. I would go here over Cowfish and eeZ, which is normally where Charlotte residents say is the best in Charlotte, but not me!"}
{"text":"First, let me say that my review is not based on the overall quality of the food, which is pretty good, but on a bad experience I had there.  I ordered a Grouper dish and was astounded when I was served what was clearly Tilapia. I am familiar with both species.  There is an obvious difference in the texture and appearance of the two. When I complained, they replaced the dish, but that meant my wife and I had to eat at different times. They did not discount the bill and did not apologize. The reason I ordered the grouper was that I'd had it previously and it was quite good.  This experience occurred about a year ago."}
{"text":"This must be one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had. Ordered martinis from the bar, and the whisky one was as sweet as syrup while the cucumber one was too sour even for my mother to drink - and she loves sour drinks! Both were terrible. Then they tried to serve me two separate incorrect entrees before finally bringing out the Pad Thai. And it was very strange and had a tomato-based sauce... I actually asked the waitress if it was really Pad Thai because it was not at all like other dishes I have enjoyed in the past at other restaurants. It didn't even taste good! She gave me a $5 dim sum gift card to smooth things over, but I dumped it in my recycle bin and am still writing this review."}
{"text":"Coconut crime brûlée was to die for. I had a sautéed grouper with mixed veggies which was cooked perfectly. My date had general tsos chicken which wasn't as good. The menu here is expansive. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"Ive been here numerous times, & will go out of my way to get more! 2 thumbs up on their sushi & martinis, my boyfriend loves their fried rice also :)"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant hidden in the middle of concord. My husband and I were greeted immediately by the lovely hostess. The restaurant was quite busy, so we had to wait 5 minutes. We were seated quickly and there were multiple servers taking care of us including the owner. The owner is super sweet and was very honest about the food. She told us about their specials during the week as well. The fried California roll is to die for. Overall the service was nice and we will be back."}
{"text":"Always awesome! They are fast and efficient and the food is delicious!!

I personally like the double pan fried dish with beef and the cowboy sushi roll."}
{"text":"E-Noodles has the best sushi in the Charlotte area.  I eat here no less than two times a week, the staff is super friendly and their food can't be beat which brings patrons like myself coming back for more. Word of advise this is not a huge place so tables go fast get there before 7pm or you might be waiting but trust me it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I went on a Monday and returned again on a Wednesday... Thinking of going again for dinner. Everything I had was pretty tasty. The pan fried pork dumplings were my favorite. I had a bowl of Ramen... it was good... but a little on the bland side. As for the Thai steak salad... heavenly. The meat was so tender! I tried the sushi and wasn't extremely impressed but once again it wasn't bad at all. I loved everything. Oh the lunch menu is shortened and everything isn't offered. Not that you will have a difficult time finding something to suit your taste... Oh and Wednesdays are half off bottles!!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi and Thai are two of my favorite foods and E Noodles does them both to perfection. The atmosphere and service are always great. Go on Thursdays for buy 1 get 1 half price Sushi!!"}
{"text":"E Noodles & co. Was recommended to me by my bank friends at Wells Fargo this place is off the chain I've found my new favorite sushi bar they also have other things than just sushi so please please stop by and have lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"Have been once and went for lunch on that occasion. The wait for food was a bit much but the sushi was extraordinary. Ordered the rainbow roll and the afton roll and both were good, the rainbow was very fresh. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I love this place. Really great selection and can make almost anything vegan and Gluten free if asked. The food is delicious and the service has always been friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Ok Food. $$/4 pricewise. Pleasant and friendly service. Great service !!! Contemporary modern Decor. 


Had the 
-salt pepper calamari-good, 

-dim sum sampler- not so good-they only had the haw guo, no siu Mai as described. server told us afterwards they had ran out of the siu Mai but it was all good since they took 20% off on this appetizer so we were ok. Wasn't much of a sampler with only one variety of dim sum, 

-Philadelphia sushi-good
-tempura sushi roll-good
- salmon, tamago, Saba nigiri-all good and decent
-shrimp fried rice- excellent 
-green tea- didn't taste like green tea at all, was Chinese black tea 
-ginger miso beef ramen- ramen was bland
-pho with beef-not authentic pho noodles or sliced beef, that beef is beef used in chow fun, 100% positive. 

Overall it was ok and decent for Charlotte and for people who aren't familiar with or expecting authentic Chinese, Japanese or Vietnamese food. 

Good thing is they have soooo much on the menu that it'll accommodate everyone in your party even the finickiest of eaters. 

Service was prompt professional and friendly. The server came by often checked on us and they did a good recovery for the disappointing dim sum sampler. It was my child so she was disappointed no siu Mai but the shrimp fried rice she LOVED and inhaled that quickly. 

Would recommend and would probably come back for a second chance"}
{"text":"The food is bland, no spice and barely any actual flavor, just mass for the belly. The chicken is mainly breading with maybe a few fascicles of actual meat."}
{"text":"Best food and best drinks in Concord. Hands down.
Karen and Alex and the entire staff here are so friendly and inviting.
Don't waste your time going anywhere else. Just come here."}
{"text":"Fantastic environment and the location is great as well. With a full sushi menu as well as a full Thai menu, nothing on the menu is bad. I would know, I dine here at least once a week. E noodles does not disappoint in service or atmosphere! Even the live music they provide on certain nights is very peaceful and sets a phenomenal tone to my evening dinner. Nothing less than 5 stars for E Noodles."}
{"text":"I went there with my son last night. Let me just start with how amazing their service is. They are kind, upbeat and their food was delicious. I've never been there before but we will be returning. The food was fresh and flavorful. The waitress was nice. There was a young man making rounds and he has personality for sure. He was nice and fun. The whole atmosphere is great. I am surprised by how good of an experience we had. I've heard of this place but NEVER went in. Big mistake. We've missed out!"}
{"text":"My family celebrated my birthday there last night and had a party of 7.  Our waitress was AMAZING!  The food was served quickly and with the temperature perfect!  The Calamari was lightly fried and delicious.  My niece has crispy shrimp with mango glaze.  Again it was lightly battered and the shrimp were huge and the glaze was lightly sweet, so good.  I had the shallot tenderloin because I wanted to try something new.  It was perfect.  The meat was tender and the right amount of seasoning with not overdone onions and shallots.  Others orders sushi and some broth noodle bowls and everyone loves what they got.  The evening was capped off with a plate of fried Oreos and ice cream!  I love this place and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"The service here  is top notch and everyone is very attentive, but it's the food that keeps me coming back.  I've tried a decent sampling of their menu from Pad Thai to a few entrees to sushi.  All of it was very good.  The sushi in now my favorite. We've tried their specialty rolls - the softshell crab is perfection and the calamari roll was just as good.  I can't even think of something bad to say about this location."}
{"text":"E-noodles.....how I love your Noodle dishes.  I must say that I'm a newbie to traditional Noodle bowls so forgive my inexperience.  I've had the Hong Kong, Japanese Tempura and their Stir Fry Yaki Ramen noodle plate.  I love all of them.  I would like to taste a little more flavor but I'm happy when it's not a 4 alarm fire so I like them.  I'd say the least flavorful of the bunch is the Tempura bowl.  They also don't give you enough Tempura Shrimp, IMO.....
   I've also eaten their sushi and while it's a little pricey it's the best in Concord.  
I highly recommend enjoying the culinary delights of eNoodles and definitely dining in.  The atmosphere, especially by the bar, is fun and has a good vibe to it."}
{"text":"At first, I wasn't a huge Sushi lover, but since I was introduced to E Noodles by a co-worker, I have to eat there at least once a week.  I like the Shrimp Tempura and their California Roll.  I'm basic when it comes to Sushi, but so far so good!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I always go when I am home. If you go here often, you know that there are lots of regulars. Its because the owners and the staff are great and will do anything to make your meal enjoyable.

They have recently added a sushi bar which I have tried a few times and its pretty good. Not the biggest sushi menu but they have all the basics plus some unique combinations. My friend got the Lotus/Orange Blossom? and it looked amazing! Next time I am going to get that for sure.

Usually I get the udon noodles and ask them to make it extra spicy. I am also a big fan of their wontons and hot and spicy soup. I actually didn't know until just recently that they served Pho as well. I will have to try that and update my review!

They also have a really cool selection of martinis that is always changing.

They have live music and a great patio in the summertime. There are also special events throughout the year including wine tastings and limited edition dinners.

They take reservations and are very accommodating. You can also book private events here and they do a buffet style meal. (I'm sure they would also do plated if you asked them to)


Portions are very big, I typically try to split whatever I am getting with someone. If not, I just take it home for tomorrow's lunch. :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of our favorites!  Best hot and sour soup ever, great sushi, hubby likes the Pad Thai, I like the pork fried rice or tenderloin beef.  Son loves the kids shrimp or chicken.  Very good flavor and fresh!  A must try!"}
{"text":"So so food. Not so great customer service. Not worthy it for me for another visit!!!

Been going to this place for years but since about a year ago or so the food here is not that great. Tempora (breaded fried shrimps and veggies) is nasty there and so so sushi. Not sure not is going on. Always too crowded and they always try to jam everyone to sit the most number of people possible regardless how a customer may feel. Not the best place to dine in for sure. Not going there again."}
{"text":"We were on vacation and the whole week we have had mediocre service and blah overpriced food --- we tried this place the last night, what a gem! The place is packed on a Wednesday night, a good sign. Everything we ordered was good, but the staff was just exceptional. Very attentive and so nice! Several different staff members stopped by and talked, always smiling. Very nice change to the rest of our week.  We will definitely be coming back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and excellent food! Went to this place a tad early, not only were we let in early, but we also had all our questions answered along, with great customer service! Food came out very fast, would defiantly come back!"}
{"text":"Didn't care this place at all, found it to to be very cramped, loud. Good was over priced for what you  got. Messed up my wife and daughters orders better options in the area IMO"}
{"text":"Small, very crowded and extremely loud. The food was not very good. I'm not really sure how this place gets good reviews or pull such a crowd. The only thing I can figure is that it had been closed for a while and just reopened not too long before we went. Sushi was terrible and the noodles were just bland, will not go back."}
{"text":"Great. The sushi is just amazing, you can even see them preparing it if you don't believe that it's real.
 I do think of this place as a sushi bar, as the sushi tastes so fresh. Some of the other foods are very good too, my little brother is 3 and only eats the Tempora Chicken, but he must like it because he always cleans his plate.
 The waiters and waitresses attitudes aren't forced. So in conclusion this may be the (closest) and best Sushi Bar in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"The remodeled restaurant with the sushi bar looks great. The staff is super friendly and very accommodating. They  made a special dish for my son that wasn't on the menu and he loved it. If you go Tuesday night they have an acoustic musician who's super talented. Great atmosphere over all and the food is delicious. I typically get the chicken pad thai."}
{"text":"eNoodles is a family and out of town-guest favorite. We love their double pan fried noodles, spicy udon, and lo Mein. They also have a delicious sushi menu. The ginger dressing is the best in town on your salad. They have great lunch specials. The staff is Wonderful and friendly. They are great for dine in or carry out."}
{"text":"A friend brought me here for pho- it was excellent! Nice flavor in the broth, the beef was very tender. The staff is so friendly. If you like jalapeños, come on Saturday for their new jalapeño martini!"}
{"text":"This place has a great location and environment is clean and well lit. Seating is offered inside and out or bar top. Was really expecting alot more than basic noodles. Sushi prices are decent but can get a better deal at other places, a little overpriced but the quality is good. As far as noodles had the pho and lah nah and yeah it's just plain. You can go to other basic places for the same price and taste. Will give a second try possibly but not likely"}
{"text":"Delicious! My boyfriend and I tried Enoodle for the first time tonight and will definitely go back! We are from New Jersey and know good sushi and Japanese/chinese food. We were seated immediately and greeted by a very friendly server. The beers were only $3 which was a plus too! We got the dynamite roll, which came quickly and was very fresh. We split the pork lo mein and General tso's chicken. The portions were very large and delicious. The pieces of pork in the lo mein were huge!  The staff was very friendly and it seemed like it was family owned. We will recommend Enoodle to our friends and will be back!"}
{"text":"Asian food catered for Americans. Don't go here if you're looking for an authentic taste. I went because of all the hype. I was highly disappointed when I tried a couple of the dishes. If I took my Asian relatives to eat here, it would be an insult to them. Basically, it is take out in a fancier place."}
{"text":"Good to accommodate large groups.  Very clean.  Yummy cuisine.  A bit salty for my taste, but I realize most Asian food is high in salt.   Great service.  Slightly high priced for lunch, and typically a wait, but nice outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I went to school with the owners daughter and so of course I am bias but really I've only had one bad experience and that was a rude comment from a guy who worked there. But the food is great and the staff is on top of their game."}
{"text":"I just ate here and oh my goodness it's my new favorite place!!  Their Singapore Mei Fun was so delicious!  And the portion was GIGANTIC!! Their hot tea was on point as well.  I thoroughly enjoyed my experience.  Wait staff was attentive and even boxed up the rest of my meal for me. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I have given this restaurant two stars. Unfortunately due to local recommendations my expectations were probably a little too high before I walked in the door. The restaurant was crowded, and the ambiance was too loud to hold any conversation. The sushi was subpar and overpriced for any value."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time a few years ago and haven't been in awhile. On a whim and in a crunch to find something for Dinner, decided to give E Noodles take out a go again.

Boy did I forget what I was missing! Forget your run of the mill asian take-out. E Noodles kicks it up a notch in freshness, quality, and flavor. Tonight we got the Spicy Udon Stir Fry and the Pad Thai, along with some Crab Rangoon. All delicious and stand out compared to the other local Chinese/Japanese restaurants. Next time we will definitely be dining in as the decor inside was warm, modern, and welcoming for the small corner location. This would be a great place to take friends or catch up with business partners alike.

Can't wait to dive more into their menu."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I was already starving before we arrived, so we tried a couple things: sushi, dim sum and noodle dish. This place does not disappoint. I loved every bite of everything we ate. Highly recommend this place. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I love eNoodles - favorites are the General Tso Chicken, veggie spring rolls and hot & sour soup. The only thing I don't love is the service occasionally - some of the waitstaff act like they're doing you a favor, especially on the To Go side. They offer an online order option, which is great, but coming in to pick up the food isn't a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"My husband & I think this is the best sushi in the area. Every roll that we have tried has always been fresh. If your not into sushi, their lo mein is awsome!"}
{"text":"Really a fan of this place.  Tried a number of things and all have been excellent.  Really an affordable food experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best, freshest sushi in the Charlotte area.  Lunch is a bargain.  Very nice people and well run resturant.   I drive from Charlotte weekly for lunch and am never disappointed.   The nigeri 8 piece lunch is amazing for 9 dollars."}
{"text":"Great Asian fussion restaurant. Had a wonderful Thai coconut peanut chicken soup. Fast courteous service."}
{"text":"Everything about the place is great. Karen the owner is so  hospitable and accommodating in every way.  The potstickers are awesome. Huge and so fresh. The chicken wings are so crispy and huge. My wife loves the pho and scallion tenderloin. Believe me when I tell you the portions are large. Her using noodles are fantastic and you can't find the portion."}
{"text":"My family comes here on a daily basis! We LOVE this place, mainly because it's so convenient to where we live and of course the food too. Service is so so friendly, and we're always greeted immediately. The place is SUPER clean too which is always good. Their food is fresh & NOT oily nor greasy. My dad loveesss their cashew chicken, & I like their broths bowls! Their soup isn't extremely salty nor bland. It has the right amount of flavor, and their sushi is pretty good too. Definitely check it out if your in the area, and don't forget to look for their seasonal specials too!(:"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love Thai and Asian food and eat it often.  I have eaten at E Noodles a number of times in the past but regardless of what I order I have never had great meal. The Thai dishes just don't taste authentic. 

For some reason E Noodles closed for a long time and because in the past the food that was not that good I have been putting off returning.  Well a group of us visited again last week and the food was still not to my liking.  The noodles were mushy and veggies over cooked.  

Although the place is packed, I can't recommend E Noodles. Parking can also present a challenge."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Asian noodles I have ever tried! I ordered the Pan Fried noodles with calamari and my husband ordered the seasonal Mongolian lamb. We also had a very tasty checked lettuce wrap appetizer. We only are sad this isn't closer to our house. The service is delightful here, too. Multiple people checked in on our during meal. I think we were the only newbies in the place. Almost everyone else who walked through the door, the staff greeted them by name and asked them specific questions like, \"how is your youngest grandson?\" Or, \"did you have a nice Spring break in Florida?\"  Looking forward to a return visit. I bet it's slammed on the weekend. We came on a Monday and it was pretty busy."}
{"text":"Always great service and atmosphere. The noodle dishes and sushi are great but the pho is amazing. This will always be our go to Asian restaurant in Concord."}
{"text":"Excellent option in Concord for sushi and Asian fusion!  100 times better than the \"other\" place near Target.  You can tell the food is fresh, and the service is speedy!  Good drink specials too!

Also, if you are Gluten-Free, Enoodles is extremely helpful- and even has GF soy sauce.  :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the pad thai and it was just ok. It did not satisfy my pad thai craving and I would not ever order it again. It was mostly vegetables with not a lot of noodles. I ordered carry out and the service was fast and I might consider going here again but knowing that it is a Americanized version of Asian food."}
{"text":"Hands down one of our favorite places to eat. Has a wide variety of options on the menu from noodle plates, sushi and now hibachi grill items. Staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I haven't dined in but I get takeout all the time. Specifically, the Singapore Curry noodles and Pho. Those are my personal faves :) Friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"i went to ENoodles with my sisters and a niece the other night.  The place was crowded but we got seated quickly.  The service was super friendly and quick.  I ordered the spicy udon with beef stir fry ....it was hands down the most delicious entree!  We shared the pot stickers and lettuce wrap appetizers and they were done very well.  Everything arrived quickly and was hot and fresh.  

This is a gem of a place.  They serve great martinis and wednesday is half price wine bottles.  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Food is excellent.. service not so much. Not kid friendly, I would not suggest you bring a child who is still in a highchair to this restaurant. They are not interested in accommodating, which is unfortunate because there food is good."}
{"text":"Really good egg-drop soup and loved the sushi. Tight booth, but fun atmosphere. Had a great time with our party."}
{"text":"Finally made it to E Noodles for the first time and was not disappointed. The bbq duck sliders served on steamed bao buns were one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat! I always get the Udon noodle. They're always packed but their service is usually really good. Definitely recommend this place. It's probably one of my number one favorite spots in all of the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"Busy even at 530pm- small restaurant. Great service. Tofu was over cooked with my japchae. Japchae was ok but no authentic Korean taste for a Korean dish. Japanese udon noodle bowl was delicious. The noodles were the best! The vegetables in the soup were big- not really bite size but plenty of yummy veggies. 
I would definitely go back!
Huge menu and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Service and food was at the top for the area 
Sushi was fresh and properly prepared 
The pho was excellent and large portion size
Had tempura for app
No complaints at all
Atmosphere was warm and wait staff friendly."}
{"text":"Great place with a variety of fresh dishes and reasonable prices. If I lived in the area, it'd be my go-to take out restaurant. Take out was fast, easy, and all orders arrived correctly. 

My group ordered a variety of noodle dishes and the Bangkok Chicken. That was my favorite and turned our just as described on the menu with an array of fresh bell peppers and a very nice milky sauce. We also really enjoyed the Spicy Stir Fried Udon. It had a slight kick, so if you're looking for something spicier, you'll need to add more chili sauce."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi around. Had the cowboy roll and Creme brûlée last time I was there and they were awesome. The service was a little slow but our waitress was very friendly. They have a nice patio along with daily drink specials. Definitely a great choice for sushi!"}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with E Noodles. They have an extensive menu and great martini list and our waitress was really sweet. On my visit last Saturday they offered 4 or 5 martinis on special for $5 each. I enjoyed two of the ginger currant, which tasted like a screwdriver with hints of ginger and black currant. My family and I split the vegetable spring roll app and scarfed it down in about two seconds. For my entree I tried the low-carb steamed grouper with baby bok choy. It was fabulous! The waitress brought me a soy-based sauce on the side and I used about half of it. The dish would have been bland without it. I tried some of my cousin's bangkok chicken (red curry) and it was HOT, so if you need your curry to be mild, be sure to make that request. My cousin's wife really enjoyed her hot and sour soup and California rolls, and my cousin's kids were happy with their noodle dishes."}
{"text":"I give it 2 thumbs up ! The martini's are fantastic and the sushi is off the chain at a good price."}
{"text":"Went here because of all the Yelp hype, and was severely disappointing. The Vietnamese ice coffee with condensed milk comes out without the traditional  stlye mini-french press and already mixed. No exaggeration, it tasted like watered down 7-11 coffee with milk in it. I traded it for a thai ice tea. We were sitting at the sushi bar and the chef had a pastry bag of wasabi that literally spurted bits of wasabi onto my head and in my drink. He of course was compactly oblivious to this, as the restaurant is so noisy you have to scream into the waiters ear to be heard. Not sure if too many of these reviewers have had proper ramen, but this is not it! The ginger pork ramens broth was almost clear, the vegetables were tasteless filler, and the pork was some kind of boiled gummy mystery meat that you would expect from Chinese take out. Halfway through the bowl I chomped down on what appeared to be a shard of bone. It was enough to put me off enough to just pay the check and leave. Unfortunate that so many people are letting this restaurant be their impression of ramen and fusion, because it is so not the one."}
{"text":"I came into the restaurant and it was packed. People were waiting outside to get a table. So I thought this place was going to be amazing but the food was alright. The price of each meal is about ten dollars. The waitresses kept asking me if I had ordered. After I repeatedly told then I need some time to look at the menu. It was like two waitresses was assigned to the same table so they kept asking the same questions over and over again which got annoying. They should be a bit more organized."}
{"text":"My favorite dish on the menu: Udon Noodles with Chicken. Very flavorful, just the right amount of spice. Can't go wrong with it. Also have some amazing sushi. My wife's favorite joint to grab sushi. Haven't had anything we don't like. Owners are very nice and always come by to talk. Also love Jenn, she's the best!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been consistently BLOWN AWAY at the quality, presentation, and overall impressiveness with the sushi here.

Most Recent Trip: Volcano Salad (fresh freshness with fresh freshies and freshly freshed sushi-esque sauces will delight your mouth), Cowboy roll (see their specialty menu - almost made me stutter, it was so good:  Tempura shrimp, cucumber, avocado, topped with chopped crab, cream cheese, masago, green onions, spicy mayo (baked in oven)*, Dynamite and Rainbow Rolls were a beautiful compliment."}
{"text":"GREAT place for lunch! I drove  by earlier, thinking it was an average Americanized Asian place, but some friends invited me to go to give it a try. 

Parking is not an issue; there's plenty of it! Be aware that it's from the entrance near QuikTrip, otherwise, you might miss it completely if you come into the shopping center from the back. 

They have the main dishes from each Asian cuisine--Japanese, Thai, Chinese, etc. I saw combos of sushi, udon, chicken & broccoli, pad thai, stir fry noodles, etc. When you walk inside, there's a sushi bar, so you can sit there or at tables. There's also outdoor seating.

We had such fantastic service! We had a group of 6, and the servers were so wonderful to not only let us sit outside, but rearranged the seating area AND got us a table umbrella from another table. 

The food had generous portions for lunch specials! I got a Pad Thai, and with that, came an appetizer choice of salad or an egg roll. The salad had a ginger-y type dressing that was fresh and delicious--it's not your typical store bought dressing. It's diced up veggies together, as if they did it earlier. The chicken pad thai was delicious as well, and I struggled to finish it all. 

An awesome place to get a fix of Asian food and prompt service. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Found this gem 5 minutes from the house, and I will be back. We almost left because it was so crowded and a bit noisy, glad we stayed. Liked every thing from the chicken satay"}
{"text":"E Noodles is the best place to go for Asian food in Cabarrus County. The noodle dishes are all fantastic. I've made it my personal goal to try all of them. So far, the seafood udon is my favorite. If you're more into sushi, the sushi menu is full of creative choices, all made with fresh and high quality seafood. If you love sushi and you're willing to share, you should try the love boat. Even Noodles will be in my regular restaurant rotation for a very long time!"}
{"text":"Lots of good food with vegetarian and vegan options, pretty reliable. Good service."}
{"text":"We love the food in this place and we will be back! However, they are so busy yesterday that cause some chaos and made us wait for a while."}
{"text":"E Noodles?  What (or who) the heck is E?  Is it Eric's noodles?  If so, I'm a total fan.  I did not actually see Eric - formerly E - at E Noodles, but he could have been hiding.  Keep your eyes peeled, just in case.

Most people probably go to the other side of 85 to Afton Ridge for a bite to eat.  But try the road less traveled and check this small shop in the corner of a strip mall.  If the weather is nice, sit outside.  You may not be able to park close, as they are usually packed, so hope for good weather (both for the short walk and for the ability to sit outside).

The staff is awesome and will direct you to a good selection if you have trouble choosing for yourself.  While not overly complicated, the menu is not immediately clear, so the help is much appreciated.  The appetizers are not outstanding, but they are decent.  Frankly, I would probably skip them and save up for the main course.  We have tried both the lettuce wraps and the miso edamame - nice but nothing special.

What really stands out are the spicy udon noodles.  Holy crap.  Sure, they are noodles, but they may be the best noodles I have ever had.  In fact, I want some now.  I wish that I was not so far away.  And that they were open, because they have probably already closed for the night.  At least I will have good dreams.  Dreams of lying in a bed of udon."}
{"text":"This is now our favorite Asian restaurant close to home. I happened to find this gem by chance, leaving the Y and looking for a good Asian place to get take-out dinner from. 
The first night, I picked up stir-fried glass noodles for myself and my husband got the pad Thai. We both loved our meals. Brent said the pad Thai was better than any other he'd had (I think that's what he said).
Next time I had the same thing and the same thing the third time. Brent tried other things, and got the red curry and sushi. The fourth time I ordered the double fried noodles and those were mind-blowing! Why had I not tried these before? I also tried the saki ramen with seafood and loved it as well. Basically I had all these meals I mentioned (5 of them) over a span of three weeks. Is it fair to say I'm hooked?
Great service too. The first time I came here it was pouring and the manager walked a patron and her three kids to their car under her umbrella. She was also very helpful in letting me substitute glass noodles in my stir fried noodles. Good service AND good food. Kudos!"}
{"text":"E Noodles does a fine job-consistent quality is what sticks out to me the most. The pad Thai and ramen bowls are some of the best I have had and the sushi is excellent as well. Portions are on point too."}
{"text":"Decent food and service most of the time, but the sushi bar has gotten prohibitively expensive. Plus they need to move to a more suitable location. Spot is simply not large enough to deal with the dinner rushes."}
{"text":"Fusion restaurants are amazing and Enoodles almost gets five stars. I found Enoodles by change on Yelp. My family and I were looking for food around Concord and Enoodles had good ratings according to Yelp. Being Asian and from Hawaii I was amazed when I looked at the online menu and spotted Hawaiian Poki! The choice to eat at Enoodles was decided based on this one item. 

The décor was up to date and eye catching and the atmosphere was comfortable and friendly. The staff was on top of refills and accommodations.   

I ordered three items from the menu Hawaiian Poki Trio ($17),  Japanese Chicken Yakitori ($7), and Yaki ramen ($8). 

Yakitori chickens came on two skewers and were good. I wanted an item I was familiar with so I got the Yakitori chicken I have tasted many other places chicken and I would say the taste wasn't the best, but worth the price. 

Hawaiian Poki Trio is what brought me to Enoodles and when I received by plate I was amazed at how fancy they tried to make a simple dish. Poki should be kept simple and cut into cubed sized bits. However, they shredded the sashimi into tiny pieces smaller than the tomato pieces in the Poki. The taste was no were near the flavor you would get from Hawaii.  The shredded Tuna mixed with the flavor of the ingredients I would not recommend this dish.  Especially for the price paid. 

My main course was a simple Yaki Ramen with pork. I'm a very simple guy and enjoy fried ramen this is why I ordered this dish. The ramen mixed with the amount of pork was awesome and the flavor of the overall dish I enjoyed.  For $8 I really enjoyed this dish and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a simple, cheap dish that won't hurt your wallet if you are disappointed. 

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys noodles or Asian food. Not perfect, but you can tell they are trying to provide great service with great food."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here, best General Tso's I've ever had- great flavor and the consistency, just the right amount of crisp, is always perfect. Their Thai Coconut Soup is also phenominal. Sushi can be authentic, or \"Americanized\". Honestly, I prefer the americanized ones as I'm not big on raw fish. Their \"Cowboy\" roll with fried chicken inside and thinly sliced steak (cooked) on top is great.

Everything is high quality ingredients, and prices only slightly higher than the cheap places where you can't even tell what kind of meat you're getting. I highly recommend this place and I'm there at least twice a month."}
{"text":"I like the appetizers.  The shrimp cold noodle salad is fantastic,  I go repeatedly for that dish alone.  The calamari was pretty good.  I was not impressed by the tempura veggies, but those are pretty hard to impart flavor to.  The staff has always been friendly and was even very helpful when we when on our kids were being difficult on our anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"Visited E Noodles recently with my girlfriend, and I was fairly impressed overall. We came in for lunch and were seated immediately, which was nice. I ordered a lunch sushi combo with spicy tuna, spicy salmon, and white fish nigiri, and she ordered hibachi chicken. We also got salads and spring rolls with our meals. The salad and my sushi were decent but nothing extraordinary, but the spring rolls were very good. My girlfriend really liked the hibachi chicken, and I would agree that it was pretty tasty- the chicken was very juicy and the sauce was excellent. The service was standard and the basic sushi rolls I got weren't great, especially for the price but I'd definitely be willing to visit E Noodles again for their entrees or to try a more specialized sushi roll."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Friendly atmosphere, great food, low prices. I've been coming here for years, and bring people here all the time. So addicting!!! If you give this place any less than 5 stars, I question your ability to make solid decisions, and don't know how you manage to tie your shoes."}
{"text":"Always great food! Have been coming here for years. Very consistent with always having great food!. I usually go for dinner and it's always very busy but I never have to wait. The owner always stops by my table to say hi and thanks me for visiting. It makes me feel appreciated.  The staff does a great job working together and realizing when each other need help and jump in to take care of each other. I have had several of the sushi rolls. Grim Reaper roll is my favorite.  The pho bowls are also great and my all time favorite is the pad thai. They even make it extra spicy on request. My sister thinks they have the best crab rangoons but my favorite appetizers are the calimari and the spring rolls. Never had a bad experience here in over 30 visits."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times.  Once to try the Pho (a vietnamese dish) which was the worst pho I've had in my life.  I could have made pho better with the instant noodle packets you find in Asian grocery stores.  The other time was with my family to get a simple beef and broccoli dish, which was only mediocre at best.  You are basically paying for the atmosphere of the restaurant, because you can find much better chinese food at your local panda express.  I'm Asian and I would much rather prefer the chinese take out places down the streets than this place. However, the staff here are friendly and they offer a martini bar now I think..which might be good although I only see families and couples eat here..."}
{"text":"Their noodle bowls are pretty filling. Definitely hits the spot on a cold or rainy day!"}
{"text":"We ordered sushi to-go and the sushi were okay. Valentine, Dragon and Spicy Tuna Roll. They were okay, more bland than I thought. Just needed a quick sushi run because the sushi restaurant we usually go is 30 minutes away so we thought to try E Noodles since it was closer to us. Probably wouldn't go back for sushi though."}
{"text":"If you're a Ramen noodle fan..this is the place for you.

We've only been once and we had a great experience and great noodles. Very fresh meals loaded with veggies and meat of your choice. Lots of variety and we will be repeat customers.

Definitely give this place a try if you're sick of the typical lackluster Chinese food offered in Concord."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. I love the sushi here. I just wish they didn't close in between lunch and dinner because I always want it in the worst way when I can't have it. :P"}
{"text":"I picked up some takeout tonight because it was Saturday and I didn't feel like cooking.  I ordered the cashew nut chicken and my son got the Pad Thai.  Very underwhelmed by my cashew nut chicken.  It was bland.  It did, however, have a lot of water chestnuts, which I love.  Some others may not so it might come off as a cheap filler ingredient.  The Pad Thai was just okay.  Definitely not the best we have had.  On a previous visit, I had the pan fried noodles and my son had the General Tso's tofu which were better than today's entrees.  I think part of the issue is that they are a Chinese restaurant making Thai food.  I should have made the trip to Mai Thai II instead.  I opted for E Noodle because it's about 3 dollar cheaper a plate.  The real thing would have been so worth the 6 bucks.  I will go back to E Noodle because I really want to get the great food and experience that everyone is raving about on Yelp.  I think we may have just been ordering the wrong things.  We'll stick to the basics next time.  After the third strike, they'll be out though."}
{"text":"I liked it a lot. The shrimp roll was the best I think I have ever had and the pad Thai was tasty. You need to request things to be spicy but overall it was really good ! Great server as well. We were just going through town on a trip and stopped in for dinner."}
{"text":"Had some that was very good (sushi) but the noodle bowl wasn't very flavorful. We will certainly be going back though."}
{"text":"Probably the best stop by for any Thai or Asian Style Curry and Fried Rice. The sushi also looked yummy but didn't have a chance to try it. I loved the food, ambience and the place.

Will stop by every time I come to Charlotte from now."}
{"text":"It was ok. I think too over priced. Thai house is better. Only thing I like was the pad see ew. The Korean taco.... no, a bit to burnt and the sauce a bit bitter and four tacos for $16... I thought my mouth was going to melt of yumminess... but a fail. My fiancé got the mandarin pork chops. Description states lightly fried these are deep deep fried. And tastes like orange chicken. Oh and then u get a side of rice and this rice was dry and hard, I told him to ask for another fresh one but he's the type that doesn't want to complain. Sushi was ok the rice was too sticky and soggy.. wow right... since our entree rice was hard! But the sushi seems like regular rice not sushi rice so this made our sushi fall apart every bite. Would I go again... no, over priced and taste is ok. Our plate was about 14 each.  Plus this is our second shot here the first time was years ago and we hated it pad Thai and pho. Never came back. Our friend suggested a couple plates so we decided to give it another shot. the customer service was ok we waited for our check for a while... luckily I had cash so we left it on the table. I feel it's too American and not authentic, but Looks delicious though."}
{"text":"This place... without a doubt, the best pad Thai I have ever had in my entire life! I wish I could give them more stars. Service was amazing, sushi was fresh, I loved it. Anyone giving this place less than five stars is crazy. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food having been to Asia I love the food! A good way to try something great and different expand your horizons don't be a Beverly hillbilly all by our life"}
{"text":"They have fried Oreos here so this place is always good in my book. There are noodles are obviously what they're known for but I've had better at other places."}
{"text":"Really great food! Don't let the outside decor fool you into thinking it's an Americanized Asian food college dive bar.  One step inside, and you know it is legit.  
We started with the veggie rolls, and they were served fast, hot, and fresh.  The dipping sauce tasted like a spicier duck sauce.
We got the house salad with ginger dressing with our meals....omg that dressing is to die for!!
We both got pad thai, me=chicken, him=pork.  The portions are HUGE and had plenty of scallions, peanuts, bean sprouts, carrots, and tons of meat.  It was also very saucy...which we LOVE!
The server was great, and always kept our drinks full, and checked on us just enough.
I couldn't believe the bill was $24 for 2 people!!  It was quite a bargain when you figure in an appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 drinks.  
We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to E Noodles twice.  I'm usually cautious of places that offer multiple cuisine options, Thai, Japanese, Chinese, etc.  This place does a nice job though.  Everyone is really nice and the service has been good.  

The last time I had the Red Curry Thai Seafood Bowl. Very nice.  It was surprisingly spicy, which I love and this dish should be that way.  The lunch menu seems to be very reasonable also."}
{"text":"Favorite Chinese place in Concord!

The food is always fresh and ready fast!

Ask for Jenny, she's my favorite waitress! : )"}
{"text":"Me and my husband had lunch here and we enjoyed the 25 minutes we spent at E Noodles...we were in somewhat of a hurry. I did however feel bad for our waitress(who seemed kind of intimidated as if it was her first day of waitressing) 
I tried the Yellow Fin Tuna Tataki with Lotus chips it was good...not the best I've ever had but it definitely sufficed. 
My husband went for the Pad Thai, which I think you can never go wrong with Pad Thai : ) 
Try their Thai Tea! it is really good"}
{"text":"I ordered Vegan Pad Thai and it was horrible. No flavor. The food was so bad I was offered a gift card (granted they don't issue refunds) and I opted to give it to random lady who was there picking up her food. (true story as the owner) Don't believe how bad the food is, try the Boba house in Greensboro and then come back to these guys and you'll be disappointed as well. 0 stars"}
{"text":"This place is super busy and quite loud. I've tried Pad Thai in so many places and this place had horrible Pad Thai. Don't order!!!"}
{"text":"This place was so great! The service was 10/10, our server was extremely nice and was on top of everything. They had my friends Togo order ready as soon as we got our checks. My friend and I both got sushi and the crab rangoons and it was awesome. Best sushi I've had in a while. The Thai ice tea was SO good also. We will be coming back"}
{"text":"I got take out sushi and it was very mediocre. It wasn't unfresh but it wasn't as flavorful as I've had at other places. It might be good for people that just kinda like sushi, but I'm a sushi fanatic and I won't be back for sushi. The reviews seem great for the noodle dishes so I might go back to try one of those dishes."}
{"text":"Dragon sushi and seaweed salad again. Okay as usual. Maybe try the singapore noodles next time, my friend ordered it, tastes good."}
{"text":"Every time it's always perfect. Consistent flavors and presentation of food. The noodle soups are amazing my fav is the miso ginger. That's a must try!  There's something for everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Just a so-so place. I honestly feel that the only reason why they have so many stars is due to a lack of diversity in the area AKA this place is not authentic if that's what you're looking for. They are easy to find and have parking available in the front of the restaurant and the back. 

It started off bad because the boyfriend and I were were told there were no tables in the restaurant available by the hostess. We chose to wait the 15 minutes we were advised and sat at the small booth. Two parties proceeded to get sat outside. When I asked if the other parties had reservations, I was told that they didn't. Long story short, the hostess was very short about why she lied about not having tables available and only stated, \"Well do you want to sit outside?\" Mind you, it was a beautiful day that day- close to fall weather. We got seated outside at the second to last available table on the large patio. 

The server, was awesome and immediately made up for the mishap. The outside section was her entire section and she was hustling. I even overheard some regulars converse with her. Other servers helped refill drinks and cleared the table frequently. I ordered a pomegranate spritz and it was very good. They had an array of $5 drinks available. 

We ordered fried pot stickers for an appetizer. Delicious! For the entree, the boyfriend ordered steak medallions and I ordered pad Thai. The boyfriends steak was not seasoned and the rice was just okay. My poor pad Thai was terrible. The size was very large (3 portions really) but it was more like noodles with sauce.

Overall, this place has a really nice ambience but I wouldn't return. You can get much better for the same price in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great little place to get a ramen bowl or some awesome sushi."}
{"text":"I just love this place.

Went the other night withal a girlfriend and maybe I was hungry or something but everything was amaze balls.  

$5 martinis were on point (3 Thai-tinis) later and so was the calamari (ask for their Thai chili sauce). Omg it was sooooooo good. 

Also love the basic Chinese lo mein with shrimp."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and tons of variety! I crave it sometimes because it is just so yummy!

The general tso chicken is also amazing. I tried the won ton soup and it wasn't my favorite. It had a strong rosemary taste, so some may like it.

The atmosphere is wonderful and the price is very fair for the food quality.

All the staff is SUPER friendly!!"}
{"text":"Love E Noodle!  This is a great little place.  Always fresh food, always friendly and quick service.  The menu has a fantastic selection, and a nice variety of sushi rolls as well.  Go early to beat the crowd."}
