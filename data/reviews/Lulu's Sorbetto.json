{"text":"This product is amazing! The flavors are all very yummy! Please don't compare it to a sno-cone, because they aren't even in the same realm. You will never believe that it doesn't contain dairy. If you don't believe me, ask for a sample."}
{"text":"Beyond grateful to find this at the 4th Avenue Street fair in Tucson Arizona! I was able to make a couple purchases at AJ's fine foods great selection my daughter who is 3 years old has something to call \"Ice Cream\" it's very delicious well worth the price!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to First Fridays in Phoenix, I find these guys.....they are my favorite! Coconut and pineapple are my favorite! ! I didnt know they had a store front OR sold them at AJs but I will definitely have to check it out more instead of once a month. Non dairy and natural frozen yumminess for these hot nights in AZ, who could ask for more?"}
{"text":"The first time the Bordeaux Sorbetto entered my mouth...it nestled upon my tongue and filled my taste buds with flavor bursts as it took over my palate.  This velvety-smooth, vegan-friendly, all-natural, handcrafted with the best local fruits in AZ, Sorbetto, quenches a dormant thirst that lies very, very deep within. The taste is sophisticated, exotic and provocative; it borders explicit and I'm sure is close to being forbidden fruit."}
{"text":"Deliciosos!!! El de coco y el de mango mis favoritos! Me recuerdas los helados de mi hermosa tierra Puerto Rico el de coco es igual y sabe demasiado rico!!"}
{"text":"Tried to check this place out today but it was closed at 4pm- no mention of closing on website. Called the number and owner said they were catering an event in Flagstaff. Would have been nice to know before driving all the way there. With customer service like that, don't think I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Happened to come across Lulu's at Southbridge Sundays.  After my friends and I sampled a few different flavors (the guy there was super nice), I decided to double up (no-brainer!) and do the coconut and blood orange together.  Seriously, the best Italian ice I have ever had.  The coconut is on a totally different level of ridiculousness.  It's a good thing I don't live around here, or I'd have a ton of extra calories to burn from constantly shoving this stuff in my face."}
{"text":"I went to the farmers market in Peoria this past weekend and OMG, so delicious!!!! Yuuuumy!"}
{"text":"My family and I (Sister, brother-in-law, 2 nieces, 1 nephew) just had hands down the most scrumptious, mouth watering, exquisite: 100% natural, gluten free, soy free, dairy free Sorbetto. When in Scottsdale, this is the spot! #lulussorbetto #scottsdale A++++ Love, love the quality, taste and service overall! We will definitely have this again!! Deliciousness!!! Thank you soooo much!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best I have ever had. I for every 1st Friday in downtown phx just to have. The people are nice who serve. Peach and coconut are my favorite."}
{"text":"Great Italian Ice!!!! Its hard to choose a flavor becuase they all are so good. The owner Joe Natale is very friendly and makes great Ice. Best Italian Ice and Service Ive had in a while."}
{"text":"Where do I start... Oh yeah, Flipping amazing!  I love this stuff.  Put scoops of Mango and Vanilla together and BOOM, I magically obtain a happy relaxing rest of my day.    I was introduced to Joe's Lulu's Sorbetto roughly 4 years ago.  Joe is a great guy and he made something very special for Maricopa County.  One thing in particular stands out is quality and consistency.  I've never had a moment where I thought the flavor strayed from perfection.  That is probably why I get so excited when I see the Lulu's Sorbetto cart at an event.    Bottom line.  I highly recommend Lulu's Sorbetto.  It is without a doubt extremely delicious."}
{"text":"I thought that I knew good \"Italian ice\", and then I met Joe and his concoctions that make up LuLu's. He's always making up new flavors (which are all fantastic) and uses the REAL food in every single one of his recipes. I recently tried Brandied Peach/Chocolate/Coconut as a combo and I regretted getting a small.  You can find Joe around Phoenix all week, and I usually catch him at First Friday. Another reviewer talks about the price, I can't believe how much I get for the quality at $3-5. Thanks Joe!"}
{"text":"LuLu's is always a \"must\", a \"go to\" if you will, when I'm at the Phoenix Public Market or whenever I see one of his carts at any local event in Phoenix.  My personal favorite is Cherry, by far, but with unique flavors such as the Blood Orange Creamsicle and Coconut and with the consistency of gelato or ice cream without any diary product whatsoever, it is a very refreshing for the upcoming summer days or any day of the year, in fact.  So, whenever you see Joe and he asks you if you want to try a sample, do it!  Your taste buds will thank you!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and popped in for something sweet after finding this business on Yelp. The mango is amazing!  The owner was really nice and informative. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had some today at the Tempe Arts Festival. Tried the Line and Bordeaux. Wow. So flavorful and sweet !  I loved it, had seconds and later in the day went back for a third round, didn't disappoint. Joe, who runs this company said it's available at A.J.'s Fine Foods.  I'll be headed there very soon to bring some home. Too good to wait for the next festival to have again."}
{"text":"The Italian ice from LuLu's is to die for! Lulu's is station during First Fridays and I always go and get myself some Italian Ice because it is so delicious. If you are going to First Fridays, Lulu's Italian Ice is a must."}
{"text":"Joe was at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival again this past weekend and shared his wonderful sorbetto.  There was always a line!"}
{"text":"Joe is a very passionate and hard working  owner who is always looking for a new flavor or idea. Who impresses with every visit to Lulu's The first sip you take from the Cherry Vanilla float makes you feel like you are a kid again. The flavor last and only gets better with every scoop, leaving you to decide if you need another one for the road. With the answer always being yes as you don't want to be left waiting for another day.  Once you try Lulu's ice you will remember those days when you were a kid on the beach, boardwalk, or just waiting for the ice cream truck turning the corner of your street."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The flavors are to die for. If you see this place around (its mobile) I definitely recommend grabbing a cup. They let you sample to find the perfect flavor and they will let you mix which is good because when I try them I'd like to take a huge cup of all of them. Last trip to the Lulu stand was at the Rave Run and I had Coconut/Mango/Orange.....and it was so good. If I have money and this place is around...I know where my cash is going to."}
{"text":"Tried LuLu's Italian ice at a festival, and it was the perfect way to cool off in the hot sun. They offer several refreshing flavors, such as blood orange creamsicle, strawberry lemon, and coconut. We tried some of the pina colada, and had a 12 oz. creamsicle. They both had a great fruity flavor, and the Italian ice itself was a nice, finely ground texture. Prices were $4 for 9 oz., and $5 for 12 oz.  P.S. I'm a bit irked that the owner, 2 years after this review, instead of focusing on the good things I write about his product, is focusing on the semantics of my sentences. So out of all the good things I write about your product, the only thing you have to say is a criticism of my description of the texture of your Italian ice? Let me say again, the texture of the product tasted finely ground, I am not professing that your product is made from ice. Also, isn't it false advertising to call your product Italian ice if it is not made from ice? But I digress."}
{"text":"Finally tried LuLu's last night at the PPM.  This was after Joe had been taunting me our last 3 visits with a sample.  I finally caved and got a sample last night (after seeing someones ice up close).    Why in the hell didn't I take Joe up on his sample when he asked me on our first time at PPM?!?!  The flavor is outstanding.  The texture is unbelievable!  And the price is very very reasonable!  $4.00 for 3 nice sized scoops.  J and I shared a cup and it was more than enough for both of us.    The strawberry-lemon and cherry (and I'm not a fan of cherry) combo is the way to go! :D"}
{"text":"Tried the sorbetto for the first time as a coffee float at First Friday....I'm picky with how my coffee tastes and I'm also lactose intolerant. Using the Vanilla Bean was PERFECT. It was so good!!! I literally sat here on google looking for the name because I couldn't remember it. I need another float...."}
{"text":"When I first tried LuLu's, I got the Blood Orange flavor. It was good, but no different than any other sorbets.  Then I tried the Vanilla Bean at the Vegetarian Festival, and mind = blown! It was creamy, not icy, and reminded me of mi abuelita's homemade ice cream from my childhood. I have since also tried the Pure Chocolate, which is also tasty and creamy, but the Vanilla Bean is my absolute favorito!  They are all natural and all vegan!  Their storefront is dangerously (for my waistline) close to my home. Their website states that you should call them ahead of time for any orders.  You can also find their products at AJ's Fine Foods and different events throughout the valley."}
{"text":"I came across LuLu's randomly on a food truck Friday lunch day. I'm from NYC.. so when someone offers me \"Italian Ice\" I am instantly skeptical.  My smugness was met with the MOST DELICIOUS coconut Italian ice that I have ever EVER had. SO amazing. The next time I saw the cart, it wasn't by chance, I was looking for him... and so I ordered two [LARGE] Italian and Mango Ice's! Literally its from God. lol  Try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The BF and I had LuLu's for the first time tonight and it was really delicious! We shared a cup of the coconut and it was wonderful. It was creamy, cold, refreshing, and just the right amount of sweetness. The texture is really nice....not icy like a snow cone, but not overly creamy either. I will definitely get this again!"}
{"text":"LuLu's is great! Joe stops by our office weekly and it makes Wednesday's much more fun. He is always thinking of new and innovative flavors, which always turn out amazing! LuLu's recently added a Cappuccino Chocolate Swirl which is amazing - he also added a hot coffee float which is delicious. My favorite combination is Chocolate Bourdeaux and the prices are excellent.   Be sure to check it out at the Phoenix Public Market, and other areas around the Valley! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We scored some sorbetto at a farmers' market in Munds Park, AZ, and LOVED it.  YUM!"}
