{"text":"Don't waste your money here. Greedy owner. 
Bad food. There is a reason they are not busy."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim while visiting friends at their Airport hotel, we shared a butter chicken, chicken tikka and lamb vindaloo, all amazing and such a great find for a fairly industrial areas, well priced to boot."}
{"text":"As for the food I can't complain - not only were the portions quite large, ensuring you had leftovers for the next day if you so desired, the dishes our group ordered were tasty & in my opinion very original, refreshing & unique!

For appy's the group picked the Beef & Veg samosas and they weren't too spicy!! Just the two appy's were a perfect size for the three of us to share. The price for the two was no more than $4.95.

For the main dish we ordered as a group, one meat dish was the butter chicken @ $14.95 and the other was beef vindaloo @ $14.95. Plus 2 orders of rice at $4.95 each and Naan, this was enough for the whole group.

As for dessert... no one had any because we were all stuffed!
We were very impressed with the dessert menu because for the size of restaurant they had (which is quite cozy), they had at NUMBER options you could choose from. 

Overall, Clay Oven had good food & we were able to stay under a reasonable budget even when buying drinks - it was about $25/per person including drinks. That's pretty good in my books, not bad at all.
It was a good experience.
Check it out and decide for yourselves."}
{"text":"Absolutely Fantastic.

Best dining experience of our life. We arrived and were immediately and cheerfully greeted by the owner. We are new to Indian dining so we asked our server for recommendations and ordered from her top three. We loved the meal. The lamb was perfectly cooked and as it became evident (by red faces and runny noses) that we picked the spiciness a bit above our untrained palettes the server suggested we get rice and some yogurt to soothe our mouths. This simple gesture allowed us to fully appreciate all the complex spices and flavours. Throughout the meal we got to know the owner and her daughter who were both incredibly friendly and personable. By the time we finished our magnificent meals our plates were taken away and replaced by mango ice-cream and some TO DIE FOR rice pudding on the house because of how much we sweated through the meal. We had not asked for dessert and were pleasantly surprised to say the least. Both desserts were fantastic and were made even better by the fact that they were given to us by the kindness and sheer generosity of this family run restaurant. 

If you enjoy Indian food and amazing service you will truly love this romantic and completely enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"There food is really good. Lots of flavour but if you order hot, you will get hot. I love spicy food and I was sweating. I really love their Bengan Bhartha but I would suggest ordering this one a little cooler then you think you can handle. Their Biryani is a little different then what I am use to but still good. One complaint that I have is that the service is a little slow and the young man there doesn't have the best customer service skills. Seems like he would rather be somewhere else."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently had dinner here for the first time and we loved it. We ordered the beef samosas and fish pakoras for the appetizers. Both were delicious and large portions. We then shared the butter chicken and ordered a side of naan. The butter chicken was amazing, we had it medium and it was the perfect spice level. I eat a lot and we had to pack food to go. This place was great, I would strongly recommend it if you like Indian food. This is now my go to Indian restaurant in Calgary."}
{"text":"My wife and I started eating at the Clay Oven when we first moved to Calgary in 2004. We loved it. Then when we had kids, we stopped going, but kept doing takeout. 

We moved to Toronto in 2008, and have been trying many different Indian restaurants in Toronto, but have never found one that we like as much. 

It's now been 5 years, and we wondered if we were just glorifying the past, and overinflating our memories of Calgary. 

However, I was recently back in Calgary for a short business trip, and returned to try the food - it still remains my favorite Indian restaurant. 

Service is great. Warm and friendly. We typically order lamb goscht, butter chicken, cauliflower, naan & rice. Portions are generous for an Indian restaurant"}
{"text":"My date and I went here after seeing a 30$ for 50$ worth of food groupon. We came closer to the end of the night, and the restaurant was quite busy (in a really good, energetic way). 

We had two servers throughout the night, and they were both very friendly and patient when it came to us asking about their favourite dishes, and their recommendations. We decided on an order of the naan, the roti, butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, and a prawn dish. We ordered the butter chicken and lamb vindaloo to compare with the butter chicken and lamb vindaloo from the Desi Grill. For drinks, we had chai (well spiced and very warming), and a mango lassi (perfect thick texture with a really nice mango flavour).

The naan was such a treat to see and eat. It came out whole (whereas some places would cut the naan into quarters for sharing); it had a crispy and well baked crust, just moist and fluffy enough to rip pieces out of. This fresh bread is something I really recommend. 

The flavours for the butter chicken and lamb vindaloo were different than what we had at the Desi Grill. Both restaurants were quite delicious, and had servings that was certainly more than what we could finish at the time. I think the pricing of the Desi Grill is slightly less than the Clay Oven, but I am really impressed by the service at the Clay Oven. 

I would like to go back and try their vegetarian dishes in the future (I've heard that their chickpea dish is really wonderful). 

Thanks for the meal!"}
{"text":"BLOODY YUK!!

We placed the order for collection, and gave them atleast 1 and 1/2 hours to make the food, not a huge order but 2 mains 2 sides and 1 desert and well now! not bloody good.

Since moving over from London UK i have tried so darn hard to find an indian place that could be on the same level! FOR GET IT.
Check my review of Namscar.

Here we got there around the right time, waited inside this very nice looking place for the food to be brought out and after 20 mins I asked the waiter where was the food, he replied it was coming. During the time of waiting 4 people came in and was seated and they got their food before ours came out!

so finally the food came out, i checked it and it was all there and the waiter did not like the fact i checked it, but i live 35 minutes away and was not going to come all the way back to get a missed dish.

so, we got home opened up the tin containers and what a mess, not your normal indian meal mess but the kind that you think \"did the guy just take left overs off dine in customer plates and just slap it in this box\".

Anyhow, NOT what a person would expect..Where has the pride and culture gone..

CHEERS

DO NOT GO HERE, SAVE YASELF!"}
{"text":"I ordered a huge amount of food for delivery in the evening. The woman on the phone was pleasant, quick and helpful. The food arrived within 45 mins as promised and delivery was only 5$ cash to the driver. The food arrived warm and was pretty good quality, 7/10. 
I would order from there again."}
{"text":"Last night was the second, and last, time we visited the Clay Oven.  While the food was pretty good, once it finally arrived after about 45 minutes, the service was horrible.  The once male waiter seemed bothered that we were in the restaurant, and forgot many requests for more drinks and water.  He even brought the bill to the table before we were finished eating!  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Clay Oven has a tasty and consistent Indian Buffet on weekdays.  It tends to be a little spicier than other buffets but it has WAY less options.  Usually tandoori chicken, butter chicken and 2 or 3 veg dishes.  

Honestly, my biggest complaint....no raita on the buffet. With the higher spice than some other buffets, it would be so nice to have some cooling yogurt.  Also, if you order it separate it is an outrageously high price ($5 or $7...can't remember which)."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant reluctantly the night before a flight,
assuming the proximity to the airport hotel would doom the food to
mediocrity at best. Not the case at all! Every dish was excellent,
each item completely homemade and fresh. Best of all for our
gluten-free family member, Clay Oven serves a gluten-free naan! We
were told by the delightful server that the chef himself recently went
gluten-free and has been working on an alternative ever since. The
result is delicious if a bit bland - our server apologized multiple
times that it isn't yet up to par - and will surely only get better.
Our only other complaint was from a diner sensitive to spicy foods who
found her curry - even mild- too much."}
{"text":"Visited Clay Oven and had their lunch buffet for the first time because of Groupon promotion. There is quite a spread of delicacies. Food are rich in flavors. My favorites are their dessert. Nice and neat ambience. Serving staffs are friendly and welcoming. Only thing Clay Oven can improve is their Chai Tea as it tasted diluted. Otherwise, everything is perfect. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant, had a Groupon, dinner for two. The Groupon never specified it was for $25. We thought it was dinner for two. However, the food was great although it took over 30mins wait time. Restaurant was very nice. Service was good. Would return!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best Indian food I have ever had. The smells alone were amazing, but then every single thing we ordered was revelatory. Except the naan, which was simply naan. The place was totally packed, despite being tucked into an out-of-the-way place. Thus our wait to get our food was a little long. But worth it. Their Dhal was spectacular. The chicken palak actually melted in my mouth. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My first time here.  The five minute wait on a Saturday night was reasonable and with it.  Great service. The food... Awesome.  Amazing flavors, rich sauces, delicious.  The garlic naan is the best I have had.  My new favorite Indian restaurant!"}
{"text":"The Clay Oven is without a doubt the best Indian restaurant in Calgary.
We have been eating here for ten years.
The food is consistently warm, flavourful and homemade. They are always accommodating to food allergies, heat level and happy to recommend. 
The Lamb Karahi was so tender, they were like morsels of meat pillows melting in your mouth. You can't replicate that at home! 
The place is small, tidy and has the aroma of beautiful food being prepared for your dining pleasure!"}
{"text":"The smell of naan and delicious spices it's floating in the air before you even enter Clay Ovens door.  A cozy and casual place in the NE.  Greeted by a warm hostess that obviously loves what she does.   From early morning to late night serving some amazing food.   
If you like Indian and great atmosphere you well love this place.   From the samosas to the perfectly chilled wine it was great!  
The for door never stopped opening to this hidden gem.   Almost all tables full on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"The best Indian in Calgary, Alberta and maybe even Canada.  you simply can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We checked out his reatuarant this week because they had gluten free chapati! This is not easy to find. We were not disappointed either. In addition to the chapapti, we ordered the aloo tikki appetizer and then malai kofta main dish. Both were delicious and the service was great! The new location had just opened and it was nicely decorated and warm. The chai is yummy too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Their mango lassis: sweet and slightly tart. The fish pakoras (basa), crisp on the outside, tender on the inside. Their lamb curry and butter chicken made me want to lick the plate. The tandoori prawns arrived on a bed of vegetables that were a wee bit scorched, but the flavours came through nonetheless. A delicious meal, served with family friendliness. Would I go back? Definitely!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the service was amazing. I ordered the Daal Pachrangi with garlic naan.  I really enjoyed the indian spices in this dish, which made it absolutely delicious to eat. You can pick your heat level and it came to the table steaming hot, just how i like it. I wish I had ordered it with rice too.  Definitely would return when visiting Calgary."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian restaurants I've tried in Calgary. I used the Groupon and have come back since trying it.  They have a great selection of food.  My favorites are the butter chicken and this paneer (cheese) dish with a cream sauce and peas.  I forgot what it's called.  Last time I went with the Groupon, I ordered naan which you're suppose to eat with curries and main dishes and was a little upset that it came out way later after the main dishes were served.  But they redeemed their service by acknowledging it came out really late and said they took it off the bill because the original naan that was made got burned so they remade it.  Mistakes happen but it takes a great restaurant to acknowledge their hiccups and provide great service.  I was even more impressed with the fact that they provided this level of service to someone using Groupon as I sometimes have had less than stellar service elsewhere when using a Groupon.  Thanks Clay Oven!"}
{"text":"Each visit to Clay Oven has guaranteed prompt, friendly service and the food is consistently delicious.  They have the best garlic naan I've had in the city.  (As another reviewer mentioned, gluten-free items are available.  I think they taste excellent.)  If you ask them to make a dish SPICY they don't hold back.  Spicy goat curry is a fave of mine and their butter chicken is finger lickin' good.  The appearance inside is simple, nice and clean.  I do like that there's a place to hang my coat.  They aren't the cheapest Indian Restaurant in the city but they're our favorite!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious East Indian Food. The spice levels we asked for were very accurate (which is something very important to me).  Decent service. They were very busy even for a Tuesday night. The location in a shabby strip mall is sad looking on the outside, but inside was nicely decorated and clean."}
{"text":"One of the better choices in the immediate area for Indian food. A close Indian friend of ours caters from this restaurant when the occasion calls for it. The lunch buffet is a good way to try the variety of dishes at mild."}
{"text":"Exquisite. Gourmet. What a find! The fact that it's hidden makes the whole experience 10 times more enjoyable. Not cheap, but delicious and worth it. And not expensive either. If it was easy to find, if the decor wasn't so nice, if the service was very bad, I might give it 4 stars. But the food was SO good! No, 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this quaint restaurant.  I've only ever had their lunch buffets but it keeps me going back.  The food is consistently good, well made and fresh.  The staff (one lady) is always smiling and happy and can manage to keep everyone happy all by herself (small dining area).  Make sure you make a reservation just to be safe."}
{"text":"We've been going here for more than ten years and we always love it! 

Our favourites are eggplant bharta, okra bindi, chicken tikka, beef kabob, aloo gobi, and the garlic naan. The bharta is the best Indian eggplant we've found in the city. 

The owners and staff are very friendly and have always been extremely accommodating to our nut, fish and dairy allergies."}
{"text":"Since moving to Calgary about two months ago, I have been on a mission to find the best Indian food in town.  I had heard good things about Clay Oven, so I was excited to go for a visit.  I tried the Lamb Saag and some garlic naan.  The lamb was very good, with a nice rich sauce and right amount of spice.  However, the naan just didn't seem right and I still can't put my finger on it.  The texture was not right and it was too thick.  For me the Indian breads are what make the meal, so I was disappointed overall with Clay Oven."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! A hidden gem with a beautiful atmosphere and outstandingly delicious quality food. Plenty of variety and everyone I went with enjoyed their food thoroughly. Very friendly service and quick to get the food out. I would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"Tried this place because I had a Groupon and was not dissapointed. Very nice modern decor- cool that there is a glass wall where you can see them prepare your food in the ovens.Excellent service, good food quality with fresh ingredients. Overall I was very impressed and happy that we gave it a shot. Will definately go back in future!"}
{"text":"The food here surpassed my expectations!  Fresh & flavourful. Will be a returning customer."}
