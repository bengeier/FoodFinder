{"text":"Sadly we made a reservation but never got a chance to experience the food. We made a reservation on open table, took a taxi a bit aways from our hotel only to be greeted by 1 waitress on the floor, holding it down, who told us they let in too many walk-ins and \"chef\" said no more people allowed. Clearly not prepared to do business. Appalled they allowed \"too many walk-ins\" mind you there were 3 tables sat with a whole restaurant empty, and would not allow their reservation in. Bad business bud."}
{"text":"This place is not prepared to do business yet. Not only do their phones not work but they were unable to accommodate us after we made a reservation on open table. There was one server who didn't know how to handle the situation and they turned us away. We wouldve been happy to have a see at the bar, which was empty. 

Obviously, the other 2 reviews were friends of the chef. Maybe wait for some more accurate ones. I almost never leave negative reviews but in this case it was warranted."}
{"text":"Wow - don't be fooled by the yelp ads and phony yelp reviews who lack any credibility with the site, this place isn't ready for the influx of yelpers - in other words, diners beware! Called 5x, no answer, decided to make an open table reservation for 8:30pm, only for our reservation to be overlooked. Understaffed and clearly out of the loop. Apparently, they'll accept walk ins but turn away people who took the time to take a $20 cab and make a reservation. We offered to grab a drink at the bar but the waitress didn't have the people skills to handle the situation (to say the least). We offered to speak with the chef, nada. Never in my life have I heard of a new restaurant turn away business due to these reasons. Pretty disappointing to say the least. I'd avoid at all costs, you're welcome! Two thumbs = DOWN!"}
{"text":"After searching through many restaurants here in town I saw this among the ad section and it looked amazing! Little did I know when I walked in here I would receive amazing service and amazing food! We were warmly welcomed by our waitress ( we did set a reservation for 6 at 8 on open table around noon and we received a call to confirm.) I want to personally thank the waitress and chef in the back whom serviced all 10 people in the restaurant all by themselves which was timely and orderly and cooked and serviced to perfection! From the steak tartare to the lamb and the prime beef it was fresh and perfection!  I know we were a handleful but thank you for being patient and being extremely attentive making sure each of her tables were being attended to. Thank you alice and Rocco for coming out and making sure everyone was welcome! 
Congrats on your newborn baby! 
Thank you very much once again!"}
{"text":"GREAT! GREAT! Good food and service! 
Tartare was fresh and tasty! The bread and spreads were delightful and unique! The main courses were all great! 
DONT LISTEN TO OTHER SALTY REVIEWERS that have bad mouthed the name of this restaurant because they didn't get what they want. Witnessing rude people badger hard working people because THEY WERE NOT PREPARED to find a nice place to eat should not misconstrue the real experience at Abiocco! 

Making a reservation 30 mins or a minute before walking in to a place has its risk so take it with a grain of salt. our waitress dealt with a room full of people and did not fail to be attentive and kind at all!"}
