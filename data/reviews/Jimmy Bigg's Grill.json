{"text":"Great place to get a sandwich for lunch if you are in between meetings in downtown akron or traveling through the falls. The exterior definitely needs some landscaping (wink, wink) and new signage which took away 1 star.  Price was around $10 for my Philly steak sandwich and huge onion rings which was satisfying. I definitely will return if I am in the area for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Since moving to the falls this year, my husband and I have eaten here twice as a couple and once with 6 of our friends.  We were leery of it due to the painfully ugly sign, but one day we thought, \"What the heck? We have tried everywhere else on State Rd.  Let's see what Jimmy Bigg's is all about.\"  It is a small bar, and it serves good food.  Cons: They have only one beer on draught, and it is something like Miller Light or Bud Light. The lighting on the \"dining\" side is garish.  The bar side is fine, though.   Pros: The Fried Zucchini coins are awesome! The Onion Rings are huge, with thick batter, which I love! Burgers.  The burgers are good!  I love the mushroom & swiss burger, and my husband loves their hot, spicy burger.  They have another great burger with salami on it.  And our servers have been great so far!"}
{"text":"Very relaxed. Good wings great people. Full bar when you want good simple American food at a fare price"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly atmosphere. They have great fresh cut fries and hand breaded fried veggies. Draft cider was a bit pricier than I expected but the food was all great."}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice now and have had a very good experience both times. The burgers are delicious, the wings are quite tasty and the service was great.  The music was quite loud, but we survived.  A great neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Yes it pays to be a regular... Since discovering this place 2 years ago, the owners have since started carrying a specific rum due to myself, my family and friends all enjoying it. I'd wait forever for the wings because they are quite simply worth it. Burgers I've heard are good, but I can't bring myself to order anything other than the wings!"}
{"text":"Go some place else... While the wait staff was polite, the overall experience definitely left a lot of room for improvement to say the least. My friend and I had to ask several times for the same items and the waitress/bartender was constantly disappearing for extended periods. The place was empty except for our table and one other and even they verbally noted to us that they couldn't find anyone to wait on them. And one of the patrons at that table actually got up and went looking for someone, to no avail... The food prices weren't terrible but the quality was lacking. My sandwich was very dry and my friend only finished half of her meal. We both ordered mixed drinks  and we can both appreciate a \"strong\" pour but the waitress/bartender was VERY heavy handed. I know that would generally be considered a good thing but really, it was just too much. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Walk in and you are immediately staring at a few high tops and the bar. It takes a minute for someone to look up and tell you that you can sit wherever you like. It looks like a decent place maybe a little run down and dilapidated but nothing you can't get over for good eats. There were families in there and it was kinda dead when I got there. Elizabeth was very kind, sweet and faulty attentive. Towards the middle of my visit they got a 10 top outside plus a few more tables out there which caused her attention level to drop a bit for my likes. The burger was big and very fresh. It was cooked correctly and the bun and fries were fresh too. I feel like I didn't get a lot of fries for paying the up charge for them as a side to my burger. I also ordered wings as it was .40 wing night. The wings were pretty good and were piping hot when they came out. While the burger lacked flavor it wasn't overly dried out. I feel like I got an ok meal for the price. Probably could have been a little bit better but I would overall recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem. The grilled chicken salad is both huge and delicious. Try the grilled mac-n-cheese if you like crusty cheese and creamy mac. The burgers and sandwiches are to-die-for! I've heard that the Philly Steak Sandwich is authentic and I can't wait to try it. The staff is friendly and the prices are cheap. You have got to try this restaurant. It will become a favorite!"}
{"text":"Great burger.  The bun is a nice sourdough.  Good beer selection.  The steak fries were pretty good, a little soft, but not bad.  Nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday night...  4 tables with people so not very crowded...  ordered food in first 10 minutes.   About 5 minutes after we ordered a group of 3 arrived and sat next to us...  they were friends of the owner as she came over and hugged them all.   That table ordered about 10 minutes after we did..  3 of them.. 2 of us... all ordered burgers.   They recieved their order 10 minutes 37 seconds before we did yet we ordered 10 MINUTES BEFORE THEM.  Guess it pays to be friends vs just a regular customer.   2 burgers took 35 minutes...  never a refill while waiting.   Ordered a bacon cheeseburger and that was it with the toppings.. no lettuce tomato or anything else..  if it wasnt included shouldnt the waitress ask what the hell you want on it??   cant come back just based on how a paying customer is ranked in importance...  shame.     Friends of the owner consisted of 3 kids...  their dad sat at the bar while the kids had the run of the place...   running back and forth in the dining side.. climbing on empty booths and dancing and singing...  all while dad and the management sat on bar side throwing em back..   poor management and poor parenting...   screw this place"}
{"text":"Jimmy Bigg's is the place to be in Cuyahoga Falls!  Biggs offers a local, homey, family owned, neighborhood bar feel with friendly staff and excellent food! :)   You have to try their grilled mac and cheese! It is to die for!"}
{"text":"If you had a bad experience here previously, give it another try! The new owners are awesome, they have a good menu & great food! If you're in the mood for bar eats or a great burger, give them a try! They have specials throughout the week too that include steak.  Fried banana pepper rings & awesome blue & bacon cheese burger! Beers on tap & bottles, plus wine & liquor."}
{"text":"When you walk in the food smell is amazing  Start off with hand breaded banana peppers awesome  The wings are amazing and the burgers are huge  Bring your appetite   Save room for dessert   Amazing staff"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. My wife had the turkey club. Piled with thick cut turkey and plenty of bacon. She said it was delicious. I had the pepper jack philly sandwich. Lots of meat and cheese on a fresh toasted roll. Both came with pickle and chips. Also had a side of big tasty onion rings. The help was friendly and efficient. Place was clean."}
{"text":"Great place for a beer and a burger. They press the burgers in house, not to mention almost everything is prepared fresh in house. Try the grilled mac and cheese! A little bit of \"hole in the wall\" charm and just the right amount of grease on your plate will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"First time eating at this restaurant today and I will definitely be back. I had a grilled chicken sandwich (sounds so simple, but probably one of the best I've had). The waitress was extremely personable and friendly. Highly recommend to anyone looking for hidden treasures of good food and service!"}
{"text":"After reading an article in the Beacon, we thought we would give Jimmy Bigg's Grille a try. HUGE MISTAKE!  We went there this evening at 7:00pm. We waited a while to be seated. We sat for at least 15 minutes before anyone offered to take our order. There were 3 of us and we all ordered a burger and fries. It took us at least another 30 minutes to get our meal(with no refills on pop while we waited). The burger was big but very dry and close to being burnt, and it had absolutely NO flavor at all. The bacon was so well done that it was hard as a rock, the top of the bun was cold and they forgot to give me any mayo. I waited and waited for the one waitress to come back so I could get some mayo. She finally brought it, and guess what. We had no utensils. So I had to wait until she finally came back so I could ask for a knife to spread the mayo. This is definately not a place to take young kids either. I heard the \"F\" bomb several times from the table full of intoxicated people at the table next to us. It cost us $36.00 for the 3 of us. There was nothing special about this place and we will never go back again!!! Not worth one star."}
{"text":"Diggin' the food here!  I haven't tried everything yet...but that is my intention by the end of the year.  I had the Philly & it was wonderful; the seasoning was perfect, the meat was real & not steak um style yuck.  The grilled mac-n-cheese??  OMG, sit down & prepare a visit with St. Peter cuz this stuff is Heaven!  My fiance had a burger & couldn't finish it all due to the size but said it was wonderful.  Christie was great as our server and we will be back over & over again."}
{"text":"Really good burgers.  Possibly the best in the area (not counting Swenson's).  On Monday night the burgers are half off after 4pm.  I'm glad I gave this place a try."}
{"text":"I have decided that I am going to try to find the best wings in the area so my first stop on this new quest was a place I had heard was pretty good, Jimmy Bigg's Grill.   The ambiance here is exactly what you would expect from a neighborhood bar and grill and it seems to work well for them. The people working and dining all seemed to be enjoying themself and there was an overall positive vibe in the place.  As for the wings, they have about a dozen different flavors to choose from and I chose the classic buffalo and their dry seasoned. The wings were nice and plump and well cooked and I would definitely get some again. Also,for a good deal they are only $0.40 each on Tuesdays when you dine-in!"}
{"text":"The food and service are absolutely awful. Was a great place when it first opened and over the years has gone to crap."}
{"text":"Stopped here with my son   this is a local eatery with outside patio  step inside for full service bar and around the back is plenty of seating and tvs   Friendly service and they have no problem cooking to your request. Crisp bacon as well as lettuce on the BLT and son ordered cheeseburger and really enjoyed. We ordered a basket of fries and absolutely wonderful  fresh cut fries  basket big enough to share and then some.  Very reasonable prices. Lucked out with coupon in entertainment book but will definitely return."}
