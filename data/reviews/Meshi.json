{"text":"Me and my boyfriend just happened to catch this nice place for dinner on its opening night tonight and we couldn't have been more pleased. Fast and friendly service, nice bright atmosphere, and delicious sushi! Not to mention the buy 1 get 1 free deal that we got with our Sweet Dynamite Roll, Gyoza, and Power of Love Roll. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Nice little place! Not a lot of space for customers so fills up quick. Reservations are possible just need to call. Sashimi was quite nice, I also paired it with a sushi rice bowl with salmon/tuna sashimi and lettuce. Also shared another roll which is escaping me but had lots of flavour and a reasonable price. 

Service was good quick and friendly, would go back again."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, fresh wasabi (not complimentary but totally worth it), really tasty rolls, clean place, good service. Love the option of \"half rolls\" so I can try more :)"}
{"text":"So glad this is finally open! My partner and I walk past this almost every day and have been waiting to try it.
It was empty when we went (middle of the week) but several people came in for take-out while we were there, so it was nice and quiet for us.
My partner ordered the sashimi combo and we were really surprised with how generous they are with their portions of fish. It seemed pricey but it was definitely worth it.
I ordered a few different rolls, all really good- I love that they offer a variety of half-rolls, great for indecisive people like me- but the star for me was the takoyaki. So good. And the real wasabi for $1."}
{"text":"Very new sushi restaurant in Beltline.  I get a real underdog feel from these guys... but I like the way they \"roll\" ... hee hee hee!  Really likable casual location.

I'm gonna say you should go out of your way to support these newcomers to the sashimi market ... Check.  Out.  Meshi!  Probably best to try on a casual summer's evening.  

Also Udon Soup... for... like... rainy days ... or when your boss yells at you but it wasn't your fault."}
{"text":"I got the lunch special chicken bento. Very good bang for your buck! Amazed at how big the rice bowl was. Came with miso and salad. Definitely will repeat again!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times now and I've tried the spicy beef bowl, spicy chicken bowl, chicken udon and unagi roll. I'm not too impressed with the flavours but the buy one get one free deal is worth it. However, I don't think I would normally pay $11 for their meat bowls as they're basically meat, rice, one piece of broccoli and some lettuce, seaweed. I would prefer more veggies in my opinion and less rice. 

Their unagi roll was not good...the fish tasted old and the amount in each roll was so little. Wouldn't order again 

However I will still give 3 stars for the flavor of the udon, it's probably something I would order over time."}
{"text":"I am from Toronto and was in Calgary for work. Having tried the nearby Indian restaurant, I wanted to try something different and was glad that I found Meshi. A small little place that is warm and cozy..it's perfect for your sushi and rice bowl. It's not that expensive and offers a variety of sushi's. You can have by the set of 8 or just go with the 1s. Thy also have some nice rice bowls. The service is fast and friendly. Overall, a good place if you want to have a quick lunch or dinner. It'll b easy on your pocket too!"}
{"text":"Perfect little hideaway downtown! Rice bowls are really well priced and the flavors are all bright and fresh! Sashimi portions are generous and fresh! Fresh wasabi is a really nice touch."}
{"text":"Came here twice now and we really liked it both times. Their Nagasaki Udon (white udon noodles with seafood and veggies) is one of the best udon that I had in YYC.  It even includes crab... not imitation crab meat... REAL crab. 

Also had their sushi pizza and it was done just right... crispy on the outside blended perfectly with the salmon and the sauce.

We also tried couple of their rolls and were very impressed. 

Definitely worth a repeat on a regular."}
{"text":"Meshi is a new sushi spot in the space that was, going back a decade or so, Uptown Sushi at 11/11 SW across the street from Co-op.

I was really impressed at the renovation (it's taken many, many months) that moved the entire kitchen and provided seating where none existed before. It's cozy and interesting. Great job there, but it's small and tight so this isn't a place to bring a big group, not more than say 6 persons. 

I ordered a spicy tuna roll and spicy chicken rice bowl. The spicy tuna roll was just superb- and it looked familiar. I recognised the squared shape of the fish inside the roll and the way the cukes were thinly pared and flared out of the roll, and then the taste with a gorgeous sweet-spicy sauce, as from a great sushi hole in the wall in the west end called Sushi and Co. Well there's a reason for that- same sushi chef! It's great to see him here at his own place with a bigger menu and more seating (Sushi and Co has almost no seating). Anyway the roll was nothing but fantastic: perfect fish, PERFECT rice, great marriage with sauce but not too saucy.

The spicy chicken bowl was also excellent although I'd order without the romaine (I just don't like ribbed lettuce in a bowl like this). Decent portion and more perfect rice too. Beautifully presented in a wooden bowl that looks a bit like a dim sum steam basket. 

Prices are good- my lunch was $20 and that without my partaking of their opening week specials.  And with that we finally have good, inexpensive sushi in the beltline- well here and at Nami. Great addition to the area!"}
