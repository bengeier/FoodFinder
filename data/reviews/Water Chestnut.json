Great Concept to dual use existing restaurant that is a breakfast/lunch place and use it at night as a ramen house.

Even love the name, in the day it is Chestnut, but at night as a ramen restaurant called Water Chestnut.

Another great concept is you build and customize your ramen by selecting the style of broth, noodles, protein and additional favorite items such as egg, veggies, corn, spinach, cabbage and other items.

There are a good selection of appetizers and our server S Waldemar quickly suggested the house made egg rolls with plum sauce
I ordered the Ramen ($10)with the pork shoulder broth, house ramen, BBQ pork, soy egg ($1.50 extra) and garlic spinach ($1.00 extra). So your $10 bowl of ramen turns into $12.50.
The broth is good, not wow, I have had better, I have had worst, the egg rolls we're okay, would not recommend.
Overall, this is not a bad place, I would not recommend to other people looking for traditional ramen."}
