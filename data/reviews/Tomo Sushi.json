{"text":"Halloween specials starts next week only $19.95 for AYCE.  We'll be back for sure. Best service & place for our date night. Love the chefs & service."}
{"text":"After nearly a dozen flawless visits it's time to award the 5 stars they've earned. I almost always go for omakase sushi or sashimi, trust the chef! The subtle treatments to the fish enhance the flavors and the progression of flavor from lighter to stronger throughout the chefs selections ensures your palette will not be overwhelmed by the previous dish.   I also recommend a pairing of Japanese shachu. The shachu is great for cleansing the palette and leaving a clean mouth feel so you can appreciate every aspect of the chef's next selection.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and friendly staff and delicious food!! The fish is fresh and the restaurant is clean. Great place to go for those sushi cravings."}
{"text":"OMG!! Love it!!! Food is great and staff is very nice. Also, the place looks nicer now that it has new management"}
{"text":"Great service!!! Our waitress was awesome:) and most important the sushi was nice and fresh n tasted great!!"}
{"text":"Tomo Sushi is another great contender of ayce sushi houses. The reason Tomo is on my top 5 list of great SH in LV is their service, fresh ingredients n wide selections of great appetizers. I highly recommend getting their skewers, sweet shrimps, n oysters. They r just exceptionally dynamite. But everything here I've tried so far is wonderfully delicious. Only gripe I have with Tomo is their location. It is locate on the corner of a strip mall u can easily past by n miss it. It is also a bit further away from the strip. But like an old sayin: Good things r hard to come by. So get out your Google map n happy eat in hunting!"}
{"text":"The servers are amazing and personable. The food is delicious - the ramen. The udon. The gyoza. Any of the the sushi ordered to date. All good!"}
{"text":"So .. The appetizers were really good. My brother who never eats salmon could not get enough of their salmon nigiri. The crazy horse roll was the most disgusting roll I've ever had in my life. I do not recommend.. Tempura ice cream barely had any ice cream. I would only come back for appetizers & to try their udon. Tomo revolution was super good .. I'd say come here if you love getting appetizers and nigiri. Stay away if all you eat is rolls. There was only 1 family in there besides us, and the wait time was ridiculous. Service was OK."}
{"text":"My favorite place for sushi in town is back. With a new name and new staff the charm is the same. The staff is very friendly and accommodates custom orders. Will be back here soon."}
{"text":"Same as the old Sushi on Trop. Overpriced. Not very tasty fish. All the rolls are tempura, crab, shrimp. Garlic sauce on everything. $5 extra per roll to change from spicy tuna to regular tuna. Waitstaff not helpful. Was hoping it would be better now. Nope."}
{"text":"THIS WAS AMAZINGGGGGGGG !  it was the most delicious sushi I've ever had !  the service was AWESOME & the staff are very kind . I will be coming here very soon & often ."}
{"text":"We did the all we can eat for dinner.  It was good but I wish they had more Tsumami for sake :)   They didn't have much selections other than rolls and rolls are very Americanized with too much sauce that I could not taste the real sushi."}
{"text":"We loved this place! The Baby Lobster and Grand Canyon rolls are awesome and the mochi dessert is great too!"}
{"text":"you wont be disappointed in this place?If you are a food connoisseur looking for some gem this is your place. Be sure to sit at the bar ?chef will give you the freshest dishes and best service"}
{"text":"No. Not sure if it was just a bad night, but the sushi was obviously a few days old and tasted like crap, the servers kept questioning our add ons as though we couldn't afford it, and we didn't have our table cleared until we asked. One, I tip 25% every time I eat out. Two, if I ask for an add on that's not part of the description, I assume it's an extra dollar or two. And Lastly, up your game! Don't serve old fish and learn your menu. Thanks for wasting the one date night we had this month."}
{"text":"Best sushi place!All you can eat sushi is my favorite!Great food and affordable,definitely great"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Very delicious - both rice and fish were very delicious. Waiter was very friendly. AYCE is a good deal - very fast service too, yet sushi is very well formed, doesn't seem rushed. Would recommend.  Dessert was a plus, it's included in the AYCE. I had the mango mochi, and it was very delicious. Better than most mochi I've had."}
{"text":"I'm very glad I came by to give the new place a try.  Fresh fish, proper tasting portions, interesting and enticing rolls.  Staff is also friends, the decor is powerful in color and we were delighted to see sushi being prepared on screen.  This is my new fav. sushi place in town."}
{"text":"I went to Tomo Sushi a few nights ago with friends. We all got the All You Can Eat dinner. We got several regular sushi dishes and rolls and we all shared, which is fun and allowed if everyone at the table orders the All You Can Eat. This place is the BOMB!!! It is very helpful that they have a menu with photos of every roll and describe what is inside the roll and what is on the outside. Everything we ordered was very very good. The place is clean. The service was very good also. Our server was busy with us and our table of 4 and we were ordering a lot different things. I didn't get his name but he was very nice and happily got us everything we wanted. I will definitely go back. I cannot say one bad thing about this place."}
{"text":"I really like this place. This place has great quality and very inexpensive, comparing with its great quality. Highly recommend udon noddle soup! The container of it looks nice!"}
{"text":"Its a wonderful restaurant. Really good customer service. The food is delicious and really fresh. I would definitly recommend this place to people who live out in the area also tourist who come to vacation in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing! Fresh, interesting and new! Very good sushi experience. Must try: Charlie's special, Jun specials, rabbit pearl. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Driving by and stopped in. Im loving the AYCE and the customer service is great.. we had 5 rolls total tempera   ice cream and honey toast. Everything was delicious! I wish it was closer to home, but ill definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was very solid, and definitely a great deal for all-you-can eat sushi. The service is also amazing, efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"All you can eat was amazing! Fresh sushi and great service! The white tuna melts in your mouth like butter."}
{"text":"Perfect  quality ??I really like grill salmon  and The sushi  here ?"}
{"text":"We were surprised to find incredibly fresh sushi like this in a Vegas strip mall. The owner, Johnny, prepared delicious sushi including live shrimp, mentaiko, kinmedai, aji, and even steak tartare. Their hot appetizers and desserts are the bomb. Come here and fill your belly while enjoying the wonderful hospitality of Johnny and his crew."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Ayce sushi. The staff are uber friendly and all the rolls were delicious. We ate at several sushi places in Vegas and this was favourite over this week."}
{"text":"Great service great food. Came here on Black Friday for after Thanksgiving dinner.  Rice to fish ratio is great and fresh.  Will be our new AYCE place to go"}
{"text":"Great salmon roll! I wish the spicy chicken came on a bed of rice though. All you came at for 19.95, haven't had it but looks like a great deal."}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing! And the service even bette! I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for good quality."}
{"text":"I could say this is my favorite sushi restaurant in town. It was our first time visiting here and we really loved it. In general, all the dishes are tasty and fish is fresh. Servers were really friendly too. We also loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. It was quite when we had dinner here so we could have a great time chatting together. From the food to the service, I absolutely recommend this place to anybody. So great !!!!! Totally coming back here again"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what everyone is raving about but this place wasn't all that great. The food took a long time to get and there were only 4 other tables of people. My friend got a beef dish and the meat was really fatty. If you like that, great, but if you dont..it was gross.  I got the AYCE and the  nagiri sushi pieces were very small.   Bonus round...I got sick all night.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi I've had in vegas. Sushi Chef Peter and the server gave amazing service. Sense it was my first time their,  I asked what do they recommend for their best rolls. The chef made me a custom hand roll that wasn't on the menu. As I kept eating the roll he was offering me different kinds of Nigiri sushi to try and they were all very good and fresh. He pointed out that they don't use frozen fish and he pulls out a halibut out of the cooler that was still moving. Overall it was amazing service and good food. I'll be back again to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Sushi Chef and waiter were VERY patient and accommodated all our requests!   The food was delicious!   Hubby had Apple 1, Baby Lobster, and Kiss of Fire. I had 911 and Yellow lady so fresh and filling! I've eaten around town from southeast to northwest and I have to say this restaurant was not a disappointment! Cannot wait to come and stuff my face with AYCE!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I've been passing by this area for months before I noticed it. It doesn't stand out but it is definitely worth checking out. The sushi is delicious. I had the crazy roll and omg.. Amazing. Very friendly and talkative. I came here alone and didn't feel uncomfortable because there was good conversation made here. I would definitely recommend my friends to give this place a chance. Will be coming again soon"}
{"text":"This is the location that wax formally sushi on Tropicana.  That business closed years ago and I was very disappointed about that. I can honestly say that Tomo is much better and I absolutely love it. They have the standard ayce items but really take it up a notch with a lot of awesome rolls that I've never seen before. I think you'll be impressed"}
{"text":"Wow! Super delicious and fresh.  The garlic edamame perfect amount of garlic and heat,  the salad dressing was so good my husband dipped his rolls in it!  Try the hulk and baby lobster!  Chicken dinner very yummy and nice portions.  Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi place in Las Vegas, hand down!! The staff and very friendly and always make you feel welcomed. It's also nice to have the owner stop by and say hi each time we stop in.  The sushi is fresh and well prepared. My wife loves the Arizona with sliced jalapeño (her added request) on top, she also love the Stinky! I enjoy the Kiss of Fire and the Garlic Tuna And Yellow Tail. But the best is the fresh Oysters!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi great people!  Five star sushi and 5 star service.  This was recommended by a sushi chef on the strip last time I stayed here so we tried it and we're not disappointed. He had a special Cajun albacore as well that was great!"}
{"text":"My fiance and i went here last night for presidents day 16' because we wanted to try a different AYCE sushi restaurant out side of our two normal places. It was surprising really good! They have a wide selection to choose from and picture of all the roll which is a plus for us! The two ladies that were working that night were really on top of their game and were very attentive to our table. They had a EXTREMELY spicy roll called the \"Burn your Boom Hole\" which we tried and i'm a huge fan of spicy and it was spicy for me. Good thing we only got half a roll because she had one piece and left me to eat the rest.   The overall interior atmosphere was awesome. Very well decorated. Bathroom was nice.    The only reason i didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating was because of the fries that i ordered. They were terrible and tasted like they were microwaved."}
{"text":"If your going to order more then 3 rolls it's worth getting the all you can eat for around $22 for lunch and $25 for dinner.  This included almost everything on the menu as much as you wanted - everything from appetizers to desert.  There were several pages of items to pick from. Drinks or Sashimi  are not included. The garlic spicy edamame and calamari was very good.  There was 5 of us and we ordered so many different types of rolls that I can't remember them all, but they were all delicious.  The one that stood out for me was this Baby Lobster roll.  I actually ordered a 2nd one. The desert was good.  I tired someone's fried or ice cream wrapped in something.  Interesting but still good.  Service was OK, our waitress was nice but kind of cold. We had a few left over sushi pieces (like 4-5 pieces) and I think that annoyed her.  She made a comment about not ordering so many. Again next time I come into Vegas, I will definitely make it a point to stop here again."}
{"text":"Ordered tuna pokey and it WAS NOT tuna. It was pale  and gooey. I called back in the number on the receipt to ask if they use something different other than tuna  and they said wrong number wrong number. It was what was on my receipt. 702 3249873... Really disappointed they couldn't at least correct this and acted like it was wrong number."}
{"text":"Loved the service. The sushi chefs are awesome and the food is absolutely delicious! Our waiter Aaron was very polite, attentive and respectful, awesome guy! Definitely recommend to everyone! Glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"After discovering that our once favourite AYCE sushi place had changed A LOT of its policies (more expensive with a more limited menu), we decided to try Tomo Sushi. Upon walking in, we were greeted and seated almost instantly, although we had to take a few to adjust our eyes to the light: coming from the beautifully sunny outdoors, it was not very well-lit inside.  The waiter was very nice and asked if we had been there before. He explained all the aspects of AYCE, like what menu items were included and which items were limited quantity per person. He brought our waters right away and brought us extra ginger.  Some of their food seemed a bit salty or wouldn't have any flavor without sauce. Their Tomo Special soup and Kalbi appetizer were really good. We also had the blue fin tuna sashimi as it was a Wednesday special, which was also delicious.  Their oven broke in the middle of our meal. After we had ordered some oven-necessary food items (unagi and baked green mussels), they informed us it would take longer than usual for those to come out. We asked how long and they said maybe 10 minutes. We said we were fine with that. Much later, they came back to us and said the oven needed much longer and, after checking with the sushi chef, they could make some of the stuff with a torch. I was a bit hesitant but my boyfriend decided to go ahead with it. The sushi came out ok with a slightly charred flavour, not necessary in a bad way as this was unagi! But it was obvious the mussels were not cooked all the way, however, I was in the restroom when they arrived so did not have a chance to say anything until after my bf had already tried two of them. According to him, they were extremely chewy and inedible (he spat them out). We brought this up with the waiter and he said it was fine that we didn't finish them and we wouldn't be charged.  The sushi chef also changed shifts partway through our meal and we noticed the nigiri had more rice in the later part of our meal. Or maybe it was their passive-aggressive way to get us fuller faster and to leave sooner (just kidding!)  I was too full for dessert (how often does that happen!?) but my bf had the tempura green tea ice cream and mango mochi, both of which he said were really good. The tempura green tea was a little more runny/melted than he would have liked but it was still good.  Kudos for the customer service as both waiters we had were very friendly. It wasn't too crowded, which was fine considering it was mid-Wednesday afternoon. But soon after the meal, we were both not feeling all that well and very dehydrated (we kept chugging water like crazy), so not sure if it's worth returning if that is the post-meal experience."}
{"text":"I LOVED Tomo during my first visit, as I was on my way to UNLV graduate school for my night class. I ordered the \"Volcano\" baked roll & the \"911\" as a hand roll, in which both were very tasty.  The female server was really amicable and nice too! :)"}
{"text":"Fresh fish cut well & pleasant staff. I am so glad they moved in!  Tomo is where Sushi on Tropicana used to be minus the attitude."}
{"text":"Im a local and ive been coming to this location for years! Theyve had various owners since ive came, but the sushi has never failed me"}
{"text":"One of best sushi place in West coast. Kind waitress and sushi chef. That was pretty gorgeous experience in Vegas that never expected to find nice sushi bar.  Fresh and tasty which I wanted tonight."}
{"text":"Fish were fresh. Special rolls delicious, Alot of choices.   Service was slow, they were packed for dinner and only 2 server,  bus person were the servers as well. But they were trying there best to keep up.   Most importantly the chefs used gloves!!   Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Seriously, awesome! Probably best sushi I've ever had. Made super fresh and cut the fish in front of us! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Tomo Sushi is a new AYCE sushi joint in the heart of Vegas, specifically, off of Trop and a lil' past Eastern. I think it replaced a sushi spot ironically called \"AYCE Sushi'. So far from the looks of it, it could be a solid sushi restaurant in this part of town.  I haven't been to the previous restaurant before it was called Tomo Sushi, but I can guess it used to be a teppanyaki restaurant or a KBBQ. I can't tell which one it was. But it doesn't matter now, because all that matters is that it's Tomo Sushi. Yes... Tomo Sushi. Not to be confused with Momo sushi even though it sounds the same. Tomo is the word. And the word is the bird.  Speaking of birds, lets get to the appetizers. I ordered a bunch, but I forgot to take pictures of a lot of them. So sue me. It's ok. Actually, don't sue me. I got a Who's your daddy, and Who's the mamma. I think that's what its called. The one with the crab stuff inside the jalepeno. I liked it. I thought the jalepeno could have been cooked a little longer, but it had a nice snap. Crackle and pop. Another thing that I enjoyed were the calamari. They had a light tempura batter. It was all good in the hood. Ordered a bunch of other stuff, I thought all of it was pretty good.  Onto the nigiri. First, all of the fish and shellfish that they used was pretty fresh. And, I thought that the rice was good as well. A special shoutout goes out to the octopus. They do a really good job with their octopussy ;-) James Bond would approve. Sean Connery, not Pierce. Gotta go with the legend on this one. Not the backup. Not the Garrafolo to the Brady. I thought they should have given him a shot. But you know Brady is going to work his magic on Paul Tagliabue. Like always. But, I'm not bitter. There is no reason why I should be. Yeah, it was good.  Ordered a miso ramen then. The noods were well cooked, but couldn't really care for the broth or egg.  This place is doing some pretty good stuff here. Not everything is a homerun, but overall, its good, no major concerns or anything."}
{"text":"I had the sashimi combo. The mackerel was a bit fishy and the snapper was tough. The rest of the platter was delicious. The White Tuna was my favorite!  Husband had the spicy crab roll and loved it. The staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS! terrible service, waited over 1 hour and barely got half of what we ordered, we were getting orders that belonged to other tables,  people were ordering after our orders and we're getting theirs first! The tall waitress lady kept rolling her eyes everytime we questioned her about anything  (mind you we waited over 30 minutes for our first order) the place has only 3 tables used and maybe 4 people at the bar, there's no reason for the confusion or slow service, the short girl was very sweet about it but it's too little too late! Sakana (Maryland  & flamingo, best sushi on the east side) I'm sorry for cheating on you!"}
{"text":"I came this place twice. Order the same---Chirashi Bowl?BUT it's A LOT different?The first time I visit, they give really thick cut and 12 piece of Sashimi on a Chirashi bowl?That's why I came second time. But I feel so disappointed this time?The second time is really thin cut and don't have 12 piece. I ask them why is big different and they said?\"oh because it's made by different chef so it's different\" WTF???I really don't know what I should say."}
{"text":"Came in with a group of people. Food was OK but I think as well as many in the rest of my group that Sushi Way is much better. Only highlight @ Tomo that was better than Sushi Way were the Shrimp heads as they were not over cooked & oil they were cooked in was fresh. Many pieces of the fish @ Tomo were mushy & not chilled. Thank goodness we didn't get ill. Waitresses did not know what any of the fish was when we were trying to order as they were asking us how to spell it & trying to look @ our menus. When dropping food off at the table we would ask what the fish was & they just looked at us like \"doe in the headlights\" & laughed. They would drop other diners orders with us of items we didn't order. Actually said many of times that they didn't know what the plate was that they were bringing us. If you're going to be in business get waitstaff that knows what the food is.   Save your $ & time & go to Sushi Way."}
{"text":"This was our dinner stop en route from the South Rim into Vegas. Although advertised as an all-you-can-eat establishment, they also offer individual dish selections. We opted for the latter.   The bulgogi entree was good and very filling. It would have been nice if it came with some rice though. We were pleasantly surprised that they honored our custom selection of sashimi, which was priced-fixed by the number of pieces.  The waiters were very welcoming and all smiles. They went above and beyond on several accounts. In addition to accommodating our custom selection of sashimi, they also gave us a free miso soup refill and offered to give us kimchi from their employee stock (they don't officially serve kimchi on their menu).  Tomo Sushi is off the beaten path of the Strip so that probably explains the lack of crowds on a Friday evening.  Great service. Good food. No waiting. Try it out!  Fun fact - we were told that this Japanese restaurant was actually owned and operated by Koreans."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, very busy and serve was great. Also checked on us and made sure the drinks were refilled...  all you can eat was so worth can't wait to return, it's a must for us now"}
{"text":"Hands down BEST sushi in Vegas! Hidden gem on Tropicana and Topaz... Nobody has better service, or fresher seafood! Even their AYCE is presented like edible art! The wife and I are here at least once/ week!"}
{"text":"Tomo is one of my regular AYCE spots.  The sushi is fresh and there's a lot to choose from. I really like it. My regular picks and favorites are the Japanese Lasagna, Baby Lobster roll, and Dragon roll. The quality and flavor are definitely worth the price.  I'm generally happy with the service, but I am taking away a star because sometimes it can be bad. I feel like I get excellent service at the start of my meal, but it declines as time progresses. Would be nice to have consistency in the service.   Other than that, I love Tomo and definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great friendly service. Lovely decoration. Greeted right at the door with a friendly smile. It was cold out and I loved the warmth right when you opened the door. Nice and toasty."}
{"text":"Very kind service, great food! I recommend the tuna poke lunch special. Only $9.00 for a good amount of food."}
{"text":"Very good food and typical prices. Service is great in this area on Trip. This is a gold mine, if you like sushi this is a must try. All 10 rolls were absolutely unique and pact with a world of flavors. (Yes I'm greedy, but I love food). You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"You can not beat thus AYCE! almost everything on menu is included!  The ramen, the appetizers,  the meats, sushi... everything!  Service was beyond fast and overly friendly. Everything we had was very delicious.  Glad we gave this place a try, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have been so many places for sushi and every time we find a place something happens or it goes down hill. This is now our go to spot the food is amazing and they have the nicest friendliest staff!!!! It's a must try you will definitely make this your sushi spot!"}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place, they have a wide selection of sushi and lots of other non sushi foods you can eat. My family and I come here frequently for the exquisite service!!"}
{"text":"When I get AYCE sushi, it's usually heavy on the nigiri, and the specials offered on my visit were nicely presented and fresh- halibut nigiri with fresh-fried onions, Baja yellow tail carpaccio, and Pollack roe. There are a few unique apps that I would suggest, the bulgogi taco (comes in a pair, street-taco style) and the garlic butter calamari (small portion, big flavor) among them. Avoid the sashimi salad.   The rolls, as others have said, are not especially strong here. I do like that most are available to order by the half. There is only one riceless option (Johnny #1). The namesake Tomo handroll was the surprise hit of the evening, and something I'd come back and order two of for a meal (not AYCE).   Location is clean and nicely decorated. Staff were professional but not particularly friendly, even sitting at the bar. Most fish was nicely cut, nigiri had a good rice ratio. I'm on this side of town pretty regularly and there aren't too many sushi spots, but this one is just okay.  NOTE: AYCE menu also includes noodle and soup dishes. Amebi nigiri comes with the fried heads!"}
{"text":"My family and I (6 people total) just ate there and the food is pretty good.  However, the service is terrible!  First of all, the drinks did not come with ice!  And we had to ask for drink refills.  The waitress did the minimum work.  Then when the bills came, she added a gratuity to each check of 18%.  Normally, I would never complain about it, however, when I simply asked about it, the waitress became rude and told me that the computer automatically did it as if it knew we were a party of 6!  Mind you, we had 3 separate checks of 2 people!  And that she could not take the gratuity off.  Then when we showed our displeasure of the service, including the lack of ice, she told us that they don't put ice in the drinks because people say the water is too cold!  After becoming very rude with me, I asked to just see where, in writing, did it state that the auto gratuity was done with parties of 6 or more.  She never was able to show me this!  I asked for a manager and she told me that SHE was the manager!  I highly doubt this!  Finally, a nice gentleman that was a server came over with new bills without the gratuity added.  So much for the computer not allowing it to be removed!  We have gone to this restaurant many times, however, due to this one disservice we will no longer eat here.  There are way too many better sushi restaurants in this town!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent!!!! The service is on point. The quality of the food is above average.me and my husband love eating hear...Peter and Pablo are very good at there job   they make us feel special every time....it's a place to eat where it just gets better. Consistently superb!!!!!! Hats off to this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna keep this short and sweet to the point. If you ate at Sakana or Yama and liked the food then you won't like it here. The rolls were just not intriguing not to me anyways. I just wasn't satisfied with my meal which was disappointing because I was reading all these Yelp review on how great this place is but for some reason it just doesn't go with me. I will give them credit however for their quick and kind service. The servers were extremely nice and helped me make decision on some of the rolls. But yeah that's about it!"}
{"text":"simply amazing! music is def something new and refreshing. world's better from when it used to be trop sushi. you can tell the new ownership put in the effort"}
{"text":"Miso delicious, found nemo role good, monkey balls sooooo good!! June special is good...so many!!"}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite sushi restaurant in LV... Possibly. So far this place has been a favorite of mine for the following reasons: freshness of their fish, variety of rolls, they offer sashimi carpaccio, does half rolls, and minimal amount of rice on their nigiri. I don't ever leave this place with the feeling of wanting to throw up because of being forced to finish my food like other sushi restaurants. In addition to that they actually give you (2) pieces of Amaebi nigiri instead of one like Sakana. I have been coming to this place once if not twice a week for almost two months straight after my sister and I tried this place out.   Must try: oysters, Amaebi, carpaccio, flying fish egg, lemon meets salmon roll.   Will add more after I'm done finishing my delicious dinner"}
{"text":"Great service sushi..great service love coming and eating here...most have vampire..baby lobster and lasagna"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place all the time when it was sushi on trop. I decided to give this new place a go. I've got to say, I'm plesently suprised. Tucked away in a little shopping center on the corner of trop and pecos - not the best area mind you - it could be easily missed.  The first two times I went, I got got takeout. Super fast super friendly, gave me a glass of water with lemon while I waited.   The second two times, I dined in.   They have tonnnnns of apps that are so delicious. The gyzoa are hot and fresh. The nigri cuts are thick and the rice small and you could tell it was real sushi rice, not just plain sticky rice. The soups are magical. If you know me, I'm a HUGE fan of soup. We had a few rolls, but mostly stuck with the nigiri. The oysters are super fresh and large. Snow white, something wrong 69, and the vampire were all delicious. The Japanese mustard on the snow white was just right.   Overall, this place was a hit. Definitely my favorite all you can eat.  I mean, besides Jjanga that is. ;)  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Let me just say how excited I am to write a review for tomo sushi. First of all, Sushi is not my number one choice of food to eat. My boyfriend and I decided we should eat something different, since we haven't eaten all you can eat sushi in over a year and a half!  As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess and the chef's in the back who ended up making our sushi. We ordered about 10 different rolls, and they were all....so so so good!!! My favorite of them all is the baby lobster roll, which consists of a California roll and on top are baby lobsters topped with a special sauce that's just mouthwatering! My boyfriends favorite ended up being the lemon meet salmon roll. That was also super delish, if I must say so myself! It's a salmon roll topped with lemon slices and a sauce that was lemony yummy!  At the end of our rolls, we ordered desert too! I got the green tea Mochi and my bf got the honey toast. Then as we were paying, the lady gave us a stamped card (my fave!!!!!), for every ten visits, you get a free all you can eat meal!!! Score! See you soon TOMO!"}
{"text":"What a gem! The food and service is excellent! Right now its 19.95 all day for AYCE.  You can order half rolls unless noted on the menu. The ratio of fish and toppings to rice is great because they do not give you an overflow of rice! Appetizers were great as well! Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Second time here and both visits were excellent.  Staff is friendly. Fish is Fresh which is most important to me. Johnnie roll and Vampire roll are good. All nigiri and sashimi are presented nicely."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty, the rolls were great. I really like the interior and the waitress was awesome."}
{"text":"I'm grateful that they had a awesome special for $19.95 ACE. I feel I got what I payed for. The issues my guests and I had were the service. For some reason I felt as if they were so busy yet, it wasn't even the slightest busy. They kept forgetting our orders, we had to re-order things more than once. Some of the things we ordered never even came out! If the service can improve I would definitely return, and definitely recommend but unfortunately after that I can't as of now.  Hightlight of the night - I tried oysters for the first time, and it wasn't bad at all!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful newish hidden gem.  We had the all you can eat sushi which honestly is a bargain. I tried all kinds of amazing new ones in addition to my favorites.  The staff was extremely attentive and friendly. It was our first time there and they make you feel like family and truly do appreciate your business.  The food also came out extremely fast. We had honey bread and tempura ice cream for dessert.  It was the perfect end to a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Simon was great!! Service awesome & food great!! We are coming back for sure!! I recommend doing all you can eat, if you like rolls & want a variety $25 for all you can eat is worth it....3 rolls equals $30 w/all you can eat you can try half rolls, appetizers, sushi & dessert!! Well worth the price!!"}
{"text":"Overall not a bad experience but there are better AYCE places in Vegas. Dinner is 25 per person and includes everything (despite the menu saying there are limitations).   Staff is very friendly and was quick to make sure we always had good ordered. It wasn't very busy though so I don't know what a busy weekend night would be like.   The options were pretty great, more appetizer and dessert options than any other AYCE place I've been to.  Sadly the major exception to this is of course the rolls. More than 75% of the rolls had imitation crab (many had crab in and on them). A large number of rolls had the same garlic ponzu sauce. The overall diversity was pretty lacking.   The quality of the rolls and fish were good however, even if they were pretty similar. I was really excited to see that they had honey toast for dessert but was really disappointed when the bread was actually nothing more than a cheap dinner roll that had been toasted. Fortunately it was still tasty (I'm not sure how you could mess up honey toast...).   The inside was very clean and nicely decorated. I'm not sure id go back, but not because it isn't good, we just have another few spots in town we prefer."}
{"text":"This sushi place is great! The environment, food, and atmosphere is refreshing and it's such an awesome place to eat at. I love eating at the sushi bar because the sushi chefs are so friendly and funny! I recommend the salmon sushi, Jun's Special roll, and end it with some honey toast as your dessert!"}
{"text":"If you don't want to read everything: restaurant is on the run down side, food made me sick, and all the positive reviews are explained by their advertisement of a free sake for positive Yelp reviews.  Just dined here. I didn't like the soup that i ordered and kindly asked if they would take it off my check. The server gave me the check with the soup on the bill anyway. When I asked again if they could take it off bc I did not eat it, the server told me \"the manager said 'just this time...' as if it was a big deal. Just FYI to the manager: the soup was $2.50 (lol) and there will not be a \"next time\" bc I wont come back. I thought I would try your spot out, but I will stick to my other sushi spots that have great customer service. So...you guys just lost a potential sushi-loving customer. Ps the server (that took my payment) was nice and I do not feel it was his fault... he was just doing his job... Also, if a restaurant is worried about saving $2.50, it's probably safe to assume they are cutting corners elsewhere and I wouldn't want to eat there. I would think the manager would have been interested to find out WHY I didn't like the soup or at least hassled me himself instead of putting it on the server. UPDATE: sick to my stomach from the food."}
{"text":"I ALMOST HAVE NO WORDS!! THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!! the food is delicious, totally worth the all you can eat price, everything I tried tasted so good, even their Tuna Pokey Salad, to me, was even better then most Poke I have ever freakin had and this comin from this Maui grown boy right here! our waiter, Aaron, like so cute, like need cute, and so nice and helpful and answered my questions on stuff i didn't know and just super awesome! there's the word... awesome... Tomo Sushi is Awesome, Amazing, Fantastic, Broke Da Mouf, Ono-luscious!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love love love this sushi joint! Always come here for lunch because the lunch specials are fantastic. I always come here for ALL YOU CAN EAT because the price is unbeatable. I recommend this place 100%"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Make sure to order the Tempura Red Bean ice cream. Mmm. Awesomeness."}
{"text":"I am so glad they are under new ownership!  The chefs are super nice and attentive, Poke was on point last time.  Cucumber salad was pickled which I didn't care for. Cheap domestic beers at $2.50 each."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and it was amazing. The 25$ all you can eat was great. Also a great way to not waste food. The miso noodles was my favorite. They had amazing service. Would love to come back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing the best so far in Vegas my new favorite!  The waiter is just amazing his name is AARON. Great service and great personality!!  All the sushi I tried is amazing and absolutely the best Tamago egg sushi I ever had in my life.  As a native of Hawaii I have eaten some great authentic Japanese food and sushi and have missed it since moving here but it's like. Little taste of home!!!!!  A++++++"}
{"text":"Took my daughter to Tomo Sushi last night for her 4th birthday. We were a party of 9. The staff was very accommodating and nice. She loved her nigiri sushi and her shrimp tempura. The rest of our party also enjoyed the AYCE menu.  Nice hole in the wall sushi joint near our home."}
{"text":"Good Asian fusion & sushi. Large variety of appetizers, noodle dishes & rolls. Rolls were a little heavy on sauces (spicy mayo, eel sauce) to my liking. But easily taken off the roll, so no problem.  We had Gyoza & monkey balls for appetizers, both very good. Split a lobster roll, shrimp tempura roll & fried rice. Plenty & good prices.    Very good service, I enjoyed it. I recommend."}
{"text":"Great service and fresh sushi, this place rocks! I recommend it to anyone with some class."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is clean and tasty. The most important thing is here is $1-2 cheaper than other all you can eat sushi places and they still have good quality of oyster, uni, sweet shrimp, sashimi salad, etc!!!! Good good"}
{"text":"Great deal for AYCE. You can get basically everything on their menu as part of AYCE except for a few of the specials. That also means you can get any of the soups.   This is a Korean owned sushi place so you'll find food items that are also Korean such as Bulgogi Tacos.   They also go overboard on the sauce. The sashimi salad had too much sauce, the same for the Screaming Orgasm.   They only had one server during a busy time so I could understand that we weren't getting full attention. But she remained super nice and friendly, even though she was very busy."}
{"text":"This continues to be my favorite sushi AYCE. Great service and Sushi is always fresh. They remember you as a customer and make sure your taken care of all the time."}
{"text":"This place is great! Always fresh fish and a great environment! Love going to all you can eat here."}
{"text":"This place is great! They forgot only one order or two but they are great and very nice! Totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"Don't judge the facade. It actually looks really new-ish, clean, well kept and well lit on the inside. Great selection and good price for unlimited lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Vegas! We have been 2x this week, a trend I'm sure that will continue! Friendly wait staff and chefs, owner Jun is on hand and preparing food along side them and talking to his guests! Attention to detail, variety of menu and good portions! One of the few AYCE doesn't overload you on rice! We love it! Ask for the \"Jun special\""}
{"text":"I come here because it's the closest AYCE sushi spot to my house. It's also very comparable to Sakana or Yama in the area so there's no reason not to come here. They include appetizers and even ramen and udon in All You Can Eat so there's a good deal of variety. I usually just stick to the appetizers and rolls. Some of my favorites are the Johnny Roll, Hulk, What Da Heck, and Gangster. I also LOVE the Tomo Hand Roll. I could probably just eat Johnny Rolls and Tomo Hand Rolls and be perfectly happy. For appetizers I always order the bulgogi. They give you a pretty large portion on a sizzling plate. I usually order the shumai too, I think it comes with three. They're nothing super special but I like dumplings.   They offer half rolls for almost everything and I usually end up ordering a ton of half rolls so I don't get stuck if I don't like something. The only drawback of Tomo is that their service is sometimes spotty. Recently I've noticed it's gotten busier which is awesome but they only have 1-2 waiters at a time and you can end up waiting for awhile to place an order. We also had an incident where we showed up right before the lunch/dinner cutoff at 3pm and got charged dinner price. We had no real way of verifying we got there before 3 so we didn't argue but be aware of this if you want to get lunch pricing around this time.   The last cool thing about Tomo is that they have a punch card. Buy 10 AYCE sushi and get 1 free I believe. However, we've never been able to redeem our punch cards because they had a separate special going for a few months and then another time they didn't let us combine two cards (even though both were mine). So the concept is cool, but they seem to always have an excuse as to why we can't redeem it. Other than that it's a perfectly good alternative to any of the more popular AYCE sushi places and unless the service gets unbearable I'll continue to come here."}
{"text":"I loved how they served,loved the sushi as well The chef was very polite and hardworking  Great place to have wonderful dinner:-) :-)"}
{"text":"FRESH, fresh, fresh.... AYCE Sushi at a great price, very nice staff, fast, delicious Sushi made fresh to order. I've been to several sushi restaurants here in the Las Vegas area, but this one by far has a great atmosphere, very attentive and friendly staff and sushi made to order to your liking, extremely fast service. You must try this place... A great experience!  I will definitely be back to enjoy another round of great food prepared by this joyful establishment. The entire staff was extremely pleasant and very accommodating. I found my new happy place!  Thank you so much TOMO Sushi, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Their AYCE is $19.95 all day! It's hard to find deal like that anywhere in Vegas that is nice and clean at the same time...there's absolutely nothing bad to say about this place...this is far from where I live but, it's worth the drive to have good food at good price. This is our go-to sushi joint for sure"}
{"text":"Horrible quality of sushi. Horrible service. Will never come here again. They tried to charge extra for the leftovers, we only had leftovers, because the food was disgusting. The server was sitting in the corner eating with friends, but every once in a while get up and help take food orders and clear tables then go sit back down to his dinner. Very poorly ran."}
{"text":"I was looking for good sushi and I found it ! Tomo Sushi is the place!   Great sushi and great atmosphere... I'm definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I used to Coke here back when it was Sushi on Trop, and I didn't like t much then, so I stopped coming...I AM SO GLAD I gave this place another chance. New name, so I'm guessing new owners.   Pros: Great AYCE prices. Sushi was SO FRESH. I ordered salmon nigiri, yellowtail nigiri, tuna nigiri to start. Delicious. Appetizers were delicious and so quick. So we're the rolls! We ordered half-Tropicana, half-Burn Your Boom Hole, full Pimp, full Pink Lady, full 911 rolls. The screaming orgasm was delicious and the salmon was so meaty in the hand rolls. Delicious green tea Mochi at the end.   Cons: Service was inconsistent. Really great at first, tough in the middle (shift exchange maybe?) and then great again towards the end.   Overall, way happy!"}
{"text":"If one is looking for sushi, this place is excellent!  They are generous on portions and quick on service and also offer AYCE.  Love it!"}
{"text":"First of all, they are newly open. Everything are fresh and clean.  The uni and sweet shrimp are soooo goood. Also nigiri has big slices of fish meat. Be honest with u guys, if u guys like sakana because of fish meat size, definatly u will like it. All the side dishes are amazing. I went there with my friends, we tried all the side dishes, it was amazing. U SHOULD TRY UDON. If u miss udon, for sure u gonna regret it. I forgot to take a pic ( we are so busy eating). All the noodles looks like al carte portion. Also soju is pretty cheap (its 8.99, other places are 11.99) if u guys like soju. This is another reason to go there. Anyways if u guys like sushi, this is my big recommendation."}
{"text":"This place is really good, my wife and I did all you can eat and ate alot and everything was very good I would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Best sushi rolls in town! I recommend tomo handroll. They have oysters too where most AYCE places don't have. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant has been open for 6 mos now and after our mediocre dinner at Sushi Goyemon, we decided to give Tomo a try.  We arrived on a Friday evening, 6pm, and nobody was at the restaurant..  They have an extensive menu to chose from for the AYCE.  We ordered our favorites, the super white, salmon, uni, amaebe, Hamachi, saba...unfortunately, our fave, the super white has fried onions and some sauce on it, which we were not a fan of.  We like our fish to be plain and simple, so we can add a bit of fresh wasabi and truly taste the flavor and freshness of the fish.  They have the scallop nigiri, but it is the small bay scallops, so we didn't order it.  I also tried the bulgogi tacos, and though the flavor was good, the meat was a bit too chewy for me so I spit it out.  The salmon and Hamachi nigiris were delicious though.    For dessert, we ordered the honey toast and green tea tempura ice cream.  They were both disappointing.  The honey toast was a Hawaiian roll, drenched in honey, with a tiny scoop of ice cream.  Not what I expected.  The green tea tempura ice cream was meh...I ate the ice cream and left the soggy tempura batter on the dish.  They also offer the stamp card...though we won't be needing it.  This is our first visit and will likely be our last.  I will give Goyemon another chance."}
{"text":"Here's the thing about Tomo...it's hit and miss. Our First visit, we were blown away by the service, presentation, and food. Our first visit was on a Saturday night and there were 4 different chefs, with the owner(I think...older Asian chef in the Tomo Video) taking care of most of our orders. Everything we ordered from appetizers to nigiri to ramen and dessert were good! (*All my photos posted are from our first visit)  This second visit was on a weeknight with two chefs, the owner wasn't there,a hispanic and  younger Asian chef(also in the video with glasses) was in charge that night. It was pretty busy for a weeknight and being in charge, he was overwhelmed by the tickets, being snappy with the waitstaff, and worse of all, presentations were sloppy, different, and not impressive like our first visit.  I don't know whether to continue our sushi search, give Tomo another chance, or to go back to Goyemon since they still have the overall better selections as far as AYCE sushi goes. If you plan to check out Tomo though, be sure that the Chef in charge is there so he can keep an eye on quality. I didn't take any pictures on our second visit because the presentations weren't as impressive as our first visit. ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  3"}
{"text":"Very good sushi. Some Of the best I've had since moving here and I eat a lot of sushi.   Johnny bravo is an awesome sushi chef.   He's funny and very good at making sushi.  You can't go wrong with Tomo sushi and Johnny bravo!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The place is so clean and the vibe is is casual. The food here is unique and of top quality. You can't get this anywhere else in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Definitely not expecting how good it is. Definitely quality! I'm a usual at Sushimon and it's defiantly comparable if not better! All you can eat at dinner time is at 24$ a bit cheaper! All you can eat menu is amazing, awesome vibe ! Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Two things stand out here that will definitely bring me back.   1. The Tomo hand roll. One of the most delicious rolls I've ever had.  Definitely going back and starting with 2 of these!  2. The lemon meet salmon roll or whatever it is.  It was the last thing I had room for so I only got a half order but next time it will be a full roll for sure.    The other rolls were decent at best and the nigiri was ok.  I enjoyed the fish to rice ratio but the sushi rice tasted either slightly undercooked or slightly old.  It wasn't as velvety as it should have been and didn't compliment the fish.  If it wasn't for the 2 rolls I mentioned above it would have been a 3 star review."}
{"text":"Another wonderful AYCE Sushi spot in Vegas. Off the Strip, takes a few minutes or 20 to get to...  Service at Tomo was spot on. Staff was very attentive, cleared plates on a regular basis and checked up on me frequently without being overly intrusive, although I did go for lunch and the place was fairly empty.  I find getting Nigiri is the best test to the quality of an AYCE eat place. If it's made properly with good large cuts of fresh fish and small amount of rice...WINNER! If its not, well...don't return!  - All the Nigiri I got here was very good to excellent. I especially loved the Garlic Tuna and the Garlic Yellowtail...with small flakes of Garlic and a slight hint of sauce...great flavor...Brilliant! - The only roll I ended up getting was the Candy Cane. It was OK, I felt like it needed more Soft Shell Crab in it.  - The Spicy Salmon hand roll was OK. Good Flavor, but could use some more Spicy Salmon in it.  - Yellowtail Carpaccio was OK...Very good presentation...but lacked the flavor. The taste did not match the visual presentation. - The Green Tea Tempura was OK. The presentation was excellent, but I felt like it didn't taste as good as it looked.  Glad to have eaten here...easily a place I will revisit."}
{"text":"Went early on a Thursday afternoon with zero crowds. Plenty of sushi bar seating, and regular tables as well. Waitress was extremely attentive. After debating on what was wanted, we agreed on doing the all you can eat. For lunch it was $22/person but includes soup, salad, appetizers, sashimi, nigiri, rolls (any kind - most can be half order) noodles and dessert.  We had the crazy roll(I think that's the name), volcano, baby lobster and tried the lasagna roll (not a fan)  Gyoza was good and nicely crisped.   Miso ramen had corn in it which I found slightly odd. The miso broth was sweetened from in assuming the corn, and didn't taste like regular miso.   Monkey balls (fried mushrooms stuffed with crab? And a spicy sauce) were absolutely delicious and yes, were ordered just because of the name)  They offer mochi, ice cream, tempura ice cream and banana split for dessert.   All in all, for the extensive menu and what's included, if you want to try more than two rolls per person, the all you can eat is worth it."}
{"text":"Had all you can eat for lunch.  Opened 3 weeks ago so \"word of mouth\" hasn't reached a lot of the locals yet.  Was not crowded for lunch so service was extremely quick.  The chef used brain power to remember each of my \"all you can eat\" orders.  The price was competitive with other all you can eat places.  The service was excellent.  The sushi was terrific.  Overall, a very pleasant experience.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"All you can eat all day for $19.95/person (special promo).  Can't beat that price!  Excellent services, especially our waitress.  10 mins away from the strip.  Food were not bad."}
{"text":"Great local spot.  Very friendly services, especially the sushi chefs.  So far better than other AYCE sushi places, and that's a lot of places I've been to.  Will come back again."}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here, and we are so glad we did! Tomo was recommended to us by a good friend who also loves sushi. I highly suggest this place to satisfy your sushi craving on a budget!  Ambiance: clean, nicely spaced seating, good lighting (not bright, but you can still see your food and your companion!), appropriate music volume, and some traditional sushi restaurant decor.  Service: very friendly, quick, and attentive. Angela was our server and she rocked!  Price: $25 AYCE that includes EVERYTHING on the menu (except sashimi & drinks)!!!! Even if you order a la carte, the prices are very good, e.g. $8 for a specialty roll!  Food: all very tasty! - Nigiri: garlic yellow tail 5/5 stars (simply awesome/best thing we had/melt in your mouth)  - Sushi: #18 burn your boom hole 4/5 stars (minus the ghost pepper sauce - so glad Angela warned us) #37 joe's special 4/5 stars #48 rabbit pearl 5/5 stars  - Spicy ramen: spicy for sure, but hit the spot!         4.5/5 stars (broth was tasty and noodles were tender, but not mushy)  Overall: great experience! We will definitely be coming back for more.  Hope this was helpful :)"}
{"text":"This place is so tastey!  And I mean fresh and flavorful.  It has been a long time since we have tried a new sushi place that was this good.  The staff is attentive and the food is Fabu!  What more can you ask for.  Best part is no wait.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service when you are not doing all you can eat. And they give you a free sake when you post a positive review on yelp, that's how they get 4.5 rating on yelp. Definitely not recommended."}
{"text":"We love coming to Tomo Sushi!  Have been here for several birthday dinners.  We always bring our out of town guests.  I love the all you can eat anything on the menu! Staff is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Went there on a Fri night around 9pm. We were going to go to Yama Sushi or Sakana, but there was a long wait so decided to come here. It's a pretty new place and there was about no customers inside. It was just me and the family for the whole restaurant other than couple of people at the sushi bar.  It's nice and clean inside and service was very nice and friendly. However the food was nothing special. I've had way better sushi (we mostly ate (and eat) special roles). The specialty roles were all similar- lacked variety. The food seemed old. I probably won't be going there again. Just OK food, there are better places for the same price range."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty, rolls were great. I really like the interior and the waitress D was great."}
{"text":"Super sushi.  The all you can eat deal is great!   Try the who's your ex wife. Like jalapeño poppers only sushi!   Chef Johnny is friendly and knows his stuff!"}
{"text":"Ok we love our sushi and of course appreciate the all you can eat!! Especially with two big eating men.  This is a new place /new ownership so glad we stopped in!!  Best Sushi in Vegas a little hole in the wall but fish is fresh rolls are delish!!  Lots of choices!! They don't overdose on the rice!  Spicey edamame yum yum!!"}
{"text":"This looks like a shady part of town but come here as soon as you can because this place is fantastic! We ordered a simple cucumber salad and Tomo's special soup - both were delicious. Then we moved on to two of the beautiful specialty rolls. We tried the Apple.. Shrimp tempura and crab - totally full flavor with a very slight kick. It had a crunchy outer coating that was to die for! We also had the Spider - which looked absolutely stunning - I ripped into it too quickly for a photo - sorry! It tasted absolutely fabulous too - tempura crab with pickled carrot and cucumber. Both came with a succulent sweet mayo sauce that just made everything so decadent. Rolls were about $9 each and sides less than $3! You would be hard pressed to get better quality at a better price!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place! Service is extremely! Chef Han and Erik are the real MVP"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi rolls!  A little heavy on the cream of cheese on some other wise yum yum."}
{"text":"The sushi is so fresh and we really enjoyed the sushi chef! Very engaging. All of the recommendations were great! Get the AYCE and try new rolls! Almost everything on the menu is included so try some new things."}
{"text":"If anything, if you're not here for the amazing food, come for the service. Our waiter had excellent service and went above and beyond in creating an excellent experience for me and my family. Our server Simon was great and had a very welcoming personality. Service was top notch and he came to check up on us throughout our visit. Food was also great. The all-you-can-eat price was definitely worth it, as the food was well made and tasted great. Overall one of my best sushi experiences in a long time"}
{"text":"UPDATED 2/9/16 Well, that was fast. The service went downhill quick at Tomo. Unfortunately, it seems they don't want my business. I ordered takeout for a 20 piece salmon sashimi and paid for it, but the chef refused to make it. I requested, as I have in the past with the 12 piece sashimi combo for it to be all salmon. Apparently they have done it before, According to the waitress, but refused to tonight. Sad. I love sushi and had been recommending this place and because I live so close, enjoyed coming here. It's disappointing. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food omg,fuck the Yama sushi waist time there ,this sushi is damn BOMB ,thanks guys for a great food and great service,we will be back soon)"}
{"text":"First time at Tomo Sushi and I have to say their sushi and the staff is amazing. Our waitress was super sweet and helpful since we had to customize some of our rolls. This place is definitely worth visiting and their AYCE is a great deal. Of course it doesn't include sashimi but there are a few no rice options you can get once that are very good, too. The screaming O (Salad) was sooo good! If other places are too crowded you shouldn't hesitate to try Tomo. We're definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Tomo Sushi replaced the old sushi place that used to be here since I could remember from a young age. While I was excited that a better establishment might have taken over, I was sorely disappointed with my experience.  I came here on a Saturday (10/17/15) for an early dinner at 4 p.m. with two friends. It was slow as it was occupied by two other tables when we arrived.  SERVICE: 2/5. While the female server was friendly, our main male server was forgetful and couldn't perform basic tasks. I would be more lenient if it was busy, but three tables divided between 2 servers and 3 chefs is quite the opposite. We had to ask for plates along with the small sides of ginger and wasabi you'd usually get immediately. A good number of our orders were missing because they weren't put in. When they were asked about, our server would respond, \"it's being made right now.\" While I appreciate the effort, it does not take 10 minutes to make a spicy tuna hand roll. It also took us 15 minutes to get our check? When we wanted to pay it as soon as we were ready, there was no one at the counter for us to walk up to and pay.  FOOD: 2/5. The general consensus was that we definitely have had better. Nothing stood out and was mostly forgettable. This place specializes in rolls and appetizers. I've had better dynamites at Goyemon, but their chicken and beef skewers are good along with their bulgogi side dish.. Like the pictures have shown, the oysters were large and were fresh. Unfortunately we only got 2 out of 4 rolls we ordered. We got Found Nemo and 1 out of the 2 Tomo handrolls we ordered. The only thing that stood out for the Found Nemo was the Japanese mustard sauce since it was different. The Tomo roll was amazingly flavorless despite having flavorful ingredients.The carpaccios we ordered tasted like plain sashimi, and the chefs forgot to peel off the film lining on the super white (making it chewy and unpleasant to eat). Some of the nigiri had awkward cuts that seemed to be flopped onto the rice and didn't taste like anything special. The one saving grace I had was the salmon skin handroll. Nicely fried salted crunchy skin with little bits of meat wrapped in a warm bundle of rice and sprouts.  tl;dr: My friends and I have experienced better. Comparing it to other nearby places like Sakana, I'd skip out on this place and would rather go there or make the drive out to Sushi Koma."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great sushi for a great price, and our server was very nice and attentive. Enjoyed everything about it, honestly. 10/10 will recommend I'm the future."}
{"text":"Typical sushi place. It's AYCE. We stopped in on a Friday night. Our waitress was a bit slow at service and it wasn't busy at all. For dessert there's honey toast. Wasn't good. Nothing special here. Not bad but not great."}
{"text":"Came here for AYCE lunch before 3 PM @ $21.95. The selection is great and fresh. I really enjoyed the food and the service. They have a frequent dinners reward card so don't forget to get your stamp! Will come again."}
{"text":"This place is legit.  Definitely do the all you can eat as it is completely worth it.  A way better value than Bacchanal if you like Japanese.  Salmon and Hamachi Nigiri were fresh and melt in your mouth.  Spider roll and popcorn lobster are a must have."}
{"text":"I love sushi and this is THE BEST SUSHI I have EVER HAD!! Can't wait for oyr next vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Everything tasted great.  Don't get me started on the appetizers....must try the yellowtail carpaccio.  I am too stuffed to write but will soon."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great sushi at a good price. Had the $25 all you can eat rolls and it was worth it. Had 4 big sushi rolls an appetizer and a drink, the bill was $28.88. Well worth it."}
{"text":"I had the gangster roll and one other and it was more than I could eat. So, no need for the \"All you can eat.\" It was really good. Seems like lots of locals too."}
{"text":"I hate being the first person to give this place a low rating, but at the same time I hope my feedback helps the restaurant improve.   I came to this restaurant for the same reason you are planning to visit, and probably why you are reading this review. This 'hot and new' restaurant has great ratings, good reviews and good prices for an ayce sushi spot. All said reasons for a visit can be deceiving. Let me share my experience in the simplest of ways.  We show up at 8pm and the place is completely empty and has a funky vibe. Not good. We decide to stay and we are immediately seated by a friendly waiter. Our drinks are ordered and we decide to get a few appetizers... And that is where everything takes a weird turn:  * We ordered the shrimp tempura appetizer and, to my unpleasant surprise, these are breaded (panko) shrimp with a thick and sometimes chewy crust. This has got to be the first Japanese restaurant I've visited where thy do not do tempura right. From the shrimp to the tempura popcorn lobster on the rolls, everything tasted of old frying oil while being incredibly bland.   * We ordered several rolls (they do half rolls on most of their menu), but quickly found out most of their rolls lacked flavor. Maybe it's a lack of use of salt, or perhaps the sauces on the rolls having similar flavored, but everything tasted like an unremarkable mush of rice and fish.   * Both the waiter who sat us down, and the lady who took care of our table, were very nice and friendly. However, our food took unusually long to arrive at the table given an empty restaurant.   Would I visit this restaurant again? Probably not. Might this have been an \"off night\" for them? Perhaps, but I want you to know there are better sushi spots out there."}
{"text":"Tomo sushi is one of the best sushi places i have ever eaten at. Everytime i come here the wait staff is very attentive and the chefs are totally on point! Not 1 roll on the menu is subpar, even the apps are grade A delicious! I will gladly keep dining here for years to come. Love Tomo!"}
{"text":"The service was great, and the sushi was delicious. We will be returning back to this sushi restaurant and sharing our experience with our family and friends. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a great sushi experience."}
{"text":"Don't go here. Mexican sushi chefs.. Wtf is that... Gross.  unagi sauce, fail.. Tuna poke, fail. Gyoza, fail. If you have a sushi place and fail those 3, you shouldn't be in sushi business."}
{"text":"Got the AYCE and the sushi was great for the price! I wish the server would have told us hat for 10 dollars more - the menu could have opened up to more options like toro salmon and unlimited sashimi. The service was fast..a little too fast for me to not enjoy my meal."}
{"text":"Tomo-tose (comatose). Has anyone even said that, yet? Because I literally walked out feeling Tomo-tosed. I felt like I had an abnormal consumption amount of msg. We came in for my son's birthday. He requested sushi, and sushi is what he got. What we got.  I had the following (whether I ordered it myself or ate off of one of my kids plate): salmon skin hand roll, garlic edamame (now you KNOW that was MY order), spicy tuna roll, garlic tuna, togarashi fries, cali tempura, Japanese lasagna, and philly tempura.   Doesn't sound like much...but I literally ate 3 bowls of the edamame and 2 of the salmon skin rolls, and I had to finish up my kids tempura rolls because they were tapping out on me. I had no crave for deep fried rolls...but I ordered wisely on my end because I knew there was no way my children would be finishing.up their orders and there was no way I was going to be paying for any leftovers.  I absolutely LOVED their garlic edamame. That wok fried flavor was in full effect. Their salmon skin roll was thee best I've had! They were not stingy with the salmon skin and the salmon skin were in big pieces. My garlic tuna tasted nice and fresh. Spicy tuna was just alright to me. The togarashi fries, though. So good. I honestly don't even know what the hell was squirted on there. I'm thinking it was cheese and that japanese.mayo, for those who know. The fries were good. But you have to eat it quick because once it settles, fries sog and the cheese part hardens.  Not gonna get into what the husband ordered because I think he ordered everything. Hahahhaah. Typical. He thought they were pretty good. However, there were some times that he complained his seaweed from his hand rolls were pretty chewy and hard to rip through.   I didn't notice when I ate my hand rolls. Perhaps it's cause I dunked the crap out of it into the wasabi mix. Which by the way...their wasabi was pretty weak that day. Don't know if it's like that all the time?   It was pretty empty when we arrived around 5. Overall, I thought this place was good. 4 stars because these were seriously theeeee most friendliest and most welcoming waitresses at an AYCE I have ever encountered. I don't know if it had to do with it being slow, but the service is the only reason why I'd return. Lies, and the garlic edamame!   Definitely recommend a try to anyone looking for another sushi spot. Kid and stroller friendly! High chairs with working buckles! Yay!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed with Tomo Sushi!  We had a very large group and came for the all-you-can-eat sushi.  It was excellent!  They served us and served us and served us!  You could get any of the rolls on the menu.  We tried many items.  Everything was stellar.    The wait staff were on top of it and we never felt like we got deserted in the dining room as sometimes happens at sushi places when you don't sit at the bar.  Every staff member treated us well and everyone left stuffed full.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After driving passed it everyday i decided to Yelp the place and found great reviews and tried it out. It does not look like an attractive place from the outside but inside has a nice intimate set up with the sushi bar on one side and tables on the other w/hanging japanese laterns. Very clean and didnt smell. Price was reasonable for all you can eat.. everything we tried was great! Tasted very fresh and not frozen.. cant stand when fish tastes like its been frozen a long time or refrozen then thawed. Will be going back again!"}
{"text":"I tried many other japanese restaurants, this one is the best out of many other places. I had all-you-can-eat sushi and I really enjoyed it . All of their ingredients were very fresh. Their appetizers were amazing. As customer service wise, all servers were freindly and helpful. I had a good experience with this restaurant  and I would strongly recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family or sure."}
{"text":"Great staff that know the true value of customer service and the restaurant first class service, the evening menu was varied and the food exceptional the baby lobster was divine."}
{"text":"The owner was nice enough to comp the escapades of mistakes that the waitress had made,  I neglected to say in my review, when they got the order right, the food was very good.  Makai"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's pretty chill. They have a very good ayce option. Favorite roll is the Tomo revolution"}
{"text":"Great food great service. Don't be fooled by the outside of the building. Food is very good quality. We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Definitely going to be our go to spot when we're in Vegas and get a hankering for AYCE sushi, which is usually every trip, if not every day!  The place is a bit of a drive from the strip, on the east side, but the food and the service makes up for the drive to say the least.  AYCE is priced similarly to other places in Vegas as well as places back here in CA."}
{"text":"Best sushi and sashimi in town happy they reopened it..they treat  me like a king..excellent customer  service..wish I could give them 10 stars....."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I were craving sushi. When we saw that our usual spot was very crowded on a Friday night we headed to an old spot know as \"sushi on trop\". We saw that the name had changed. We came in and was a very nice location. The environment was very funny and really enjoyed our meal. The sushi was really yummy. Would definitely recommend this location. Nothing but laughs with Itamae Johnny! =]"}
{"text":"Needed something different for dinner and decided to try Tomo Sushi. Pretty good and had great  $$$ for all you can eat. Some of there items were different from what I was used to, but good. There sweet shrimp was good as was all the sashimi. Will be back for sure.."}
{"text":"A step up from the previous establishment. No fishy smell. Service was fast & friendly. Rolls were a good size and not packed with too much rice. Nigiri was also a good size. The vampire roll was great. My mom is super picky & even liked it. Caterpillar barely had any eel. Will be back"}

{"text":"Love it good sushi good ambiance would recommended to anyone who looking for a nice sushi spot"}
{"text":"When I go for AYCE, my standard meal is starting with miso soup, shrimp tempura, maybe half a roll, and lots and lots of nigiri.   The miso soup here was a liiil' salty. They forgot the shrimp tempura I ordered, but it's one of those things that by the time we were towards the end of the meal, I was hoping they wouldn't remember because I was so full.  I was not a fan of the What da Heck roll at all. It was very, very meh. The Orange Blossom was a little better, but both rolls had too much sauce. I did like they do half orders here though.  The nigiri had good fish to rice ratio, and comes in small portions which I always appreciate it AYCE. The tuna, salmon egg, sweet shrimp, uni, and tamago were all standard. The garlic tuna and garlic yellowtail were flavorful. They were out of the carpaccio, so they gave us toro (fatty tuna) without extra charge instead. I'm not a fan, but my boyfriend loved it, and it was super nice of them to do that for us. The oysters we got were also super vinegary which I enjoyed.    As for cooked items, my boyfriend ordered the dynamite, monkey ball, and salmon Kama since they were out of hamachi. I thought all of them were okay, but he liked them so I guess it's just up to preference.  Overall, I would recommend this place. I thought the rolls were too heavy and drowned with sauce, the cooked items were meh, but the nigiri was good and that's the most important thing when I go for sushi. I'd give the food a 3.5 separately, but the customer service bumps it to a 4 because they were so friendly and accommodating."}
