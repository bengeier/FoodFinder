{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would.The new spot is nice that's the only reason it gets one star. The servers are so crabby. The food is terrible! You can get a way better meal in the food court and better service...save your $"}
{"text":"Don't bother with this place. It's just the epitome of mediocre. Ordered chicken fajitas and the salmon, both were super bland and just blah. The salmon came with a salad, which was straight out of a bagged salad from the grocery store, we could tell. Like literally, a dole bagged salad they just poured out onto the plate for us. We sent that back and asked for the soup instead. Minestrone was decent.

The salmon was bland - so bland. No sauce or anything on it. Looked like it had been seasoned, but it sure didn't taste like it. It was also pretty dry. The baked potato was sufficient and the vegetables looked like they were frozen before being cooked.

The chicken fajitas showed up with lettuce to go inside them - which was also the Dole bagged salad. We sent that back again and asked for fresh lettuce. A few minutes later we got that - imagine what they can do when they put their minds to it over there? Lol fresh, chopped iceberg lettuce! We lucked out. Anyway, the fajitas were OK. I mean, there was chicken and it was cooked and covered in some sauce, but none of it really had much flavor so I killed it with hot sauce and called it a day.

It's not that this place is horrible, it's just painfully mediocre. I won't go again. Rubys in the food court is miles better than this place for 1/4 the price."}
{"text":"I have lived in the area all my life and love going to Watts! 
My family has a tradition where we go to Watts for breakfast on someone's birthday the food is good, the price is right, and the service is great!."}
{"text":"Their breakfast foods were ok, but was not a fan of the steak and kidney pie. I'll probably try their other pies though someday."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a second try if you ate at the previous location. It has upgraded a lot since then. Great food and such a large selection.  Food comes out pretty fast (most of the time) and hot. My new fav local restaurant!"}
{"text":"The one star is because we did get good service from the server.
If I could, I would have given minus three stars for everything else.

My sister and I decided to eat dinner here last Monday as we were in Eglinton Square and didn't want \"fast food\" from the food court.
Huge mistake!

First of all,we waited over 30 minutes for our food. Many people who arrived after us were getting their food before us. \"Okay\" we figured, \"It's going to be really good and worth the wait\". WRONG! My toasted club only had butter on one piece of toast, the bacon was off (smelled sour) and it was so poorly put together it didn't even look appetizing. The \"home fries were just as bad. Dry and bland. Our server was very apologetic and offered to take it back, but we had waited so long and were sooo hungry we didn't want to wait again ( plus my sister thinks if you send food back, they will do awful things to it)
I pulled it apart and only ate the turkey, some of the toast and the tomatoes. We would have left but we were both starving by this time.

My sister's Hot Hamburger was just as bad. The gravy was way over salted and the peas were frozen peas and over cooked. She did like the potatoes and only ate most of those.

I will say the prices were fairly cheap (Maybe that's why the food was so bad)

Save yourself the disappointment and eat at the food court. The food will have more flavor, the wait won't be as long and you won't (hopefully) get food that's gone bad"}
{"text":"I like the newly renovated Watts. I wish they can improve their food menu."}
{"text":"If i was visiting grandma and grandpa in a seniors living home and the cooks there were mediocre this is what you would eat.  This restaurant has been in eglinton square since 1954 and i think the wait staff and patrons are the same people from 1954. and the gravy too!!

The lunch special was chicken pot pie with mash and gravy, sounds old school which i love if it tasted old school.  The pot pie was a pile of mush and ground chicken with peas and carrots and a thick gooey gravy (luke warm).  It looked like someone had ate it and then barfed it back up on my plate.  The chicken gravy is a goo of flour no flavour and mash that needed help (salt and pepper)  over whipped, where they tasted like paste.  $8.95

Old fashion cheeseburger with fries, i will give half star for the meat it was ok, the fries are the cheapest brand of frozen, you know the ones that have that weird batter of salt on them.  Just horrible. $7.95

$3 for a pop wft.  we are talking about a restaurant in a shitty mall in Scarborough. So disappointing.  

The waitress was nice (half star), i did tell her the food was awful and our plates still had most of it on them.  She was lost as to what to do?  The clientele was 70 plus and i don't think they complain often. or have lost their taste buds

Old school can be good, but not this place stay away.  I usually get a Falafel from Rubys in there smallish food court, should have done that.

$26 TAX AND TIP.....not worth even $10 bucks."}
{"text":"2 visits, too many.

My co-worker and I will drop by here since we work roughly 2 minutes away. Yesterday was the second and very last time we were ever going to visit. We just kept asking eachother, \"Why did we come back?\"

The food is mediocre at best, not the worst I've had, but I've definitely had better. For the prices they pump from you, it's DEFINITELY not worth it.

The environment is nice, very cozy. Which breaks my heart, this place could have so much potential but lacks in every single element in creating a good restaurant.

My main issue with this place is the service. You know that feeling when you go into a Chinese restaurant, and the waitress isn't really around, and you gotta put serious effort into flagging one down? It's like that, but 10 times worse. Way worse. 

Mind you I've only sat in the dining area, and not in the bar area, so I would hopefully wish that it'd be easier to get the attention of a waitress in the bar area. The problem with the dining area, is that it's split in half by this huge wall. And to add salt to the wound, the booths are very, very, very tall. I don't know who to blame, the designers of this place? Or the fact that the waitresses are well aware of this and don't roam around your area at least a good every 10 minutes.

Want to wave your hand to try to flag someone? Nope. You gotta stand for that.

The first time I went here I got the big breakfast, nothing special. It's hard to screw up breakfast food. Yesterday, I had the fish and chips. For a restaurant that specializes in British food, their fish and chips was a joke. It even got worse when I had picked up on this .. Weird ... Rotten egg smell. It came from the coleslaw. I gave it a taste and pushed it far, far away from me. I appreciate their 'Flare' by putting bell peppers in the tartar sauce, but you know how that old saying goes, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" I want tartar sauce with my greasy fish and chips, not a bell pepper smoothie.

Unless you got a good 2 hours to kill, and need to fit some squats into your daily regimen from standing and sitting in your booth trying to get the attention of a waitress, then I would say ... Save your god damn money and don't visit here."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch with friends on a cold, overcast Saturday in December.  We picked it because they live in the area and we didn't want to drive far, nor eat at a chain.  The place was mostly empty when we arrived around noon.  When you come in the entranceway, there's a room to the left and a room to the right.  We picked the right.  Large bar with about a dozen tables per side?  Standard family style restaurant, with wooden tables & booths, some nice lights, very clean, recently renovated.  Straightforward, simple service.  I actually ordered Eggs Florentine off their all day breakfast menu and liked it a lot.  The hollandaise tasted extra buttery, where I find lots of places it's too bland.  I don't see it on their online menu but think it was around $10, so definitely worth it.  The roasted home fries were a tad dry and could've used some more seasoning, but good enough.  My partner found his big breakfast (9.95 for 3 eggs, ham, bacon, toast & home fries) was great for the price.  Although there's nothing special about this place, I'd go back any time if someone wanted to."}
{"text":"The restaurant has move to a new location, but in the same mall. I stopped in there for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. The new restaurant is bright, clean and large. The same staff are there and the menu is still basically the same. 

The new location has an entrance that can be accessed from the rear parking lot, or from the mall. 

I was very happy with my visit and I'll be sure to return again soon."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years, first in it's previous location within the mall and, now, in the re-located place near the food court (with bonus access from another door straight outside to the parking lot). Typical family style food. I often order the appetizer quesidilla which is enough for a meal. Pot pies are great. If you go at lunch, maybe your server will be Maria. She has the uncany ability to remember up to 16 orders without writing anything down. (we go there with a group sometime)."}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant when we have our 9 year old grandson with us.  He enjoys chicken fingers and the atmoshphere here.  It is always clean with pleasant service.  The staff are longterm employees that always are wonderful to chat to.  Its  homestyle cooking that brings me back to childhood on the prairies.  When you want pie...come here!  Breakfast?   Come here.  Love you Watts!"}
{"text":"Avoid the French onion soup...the cheese tastes like margarine and the broth must be from a can, it's terrible. 

The New York steak is better than expected at $18...char grilled and it was very good.

Burger was average, most of the other food we ordered (fish & chips, nachos with chili) tasted like cafeteria food."}
{"text":"Ok so this probably not going to be one of my standard long winded reviews. Probably because there's really not much to it. Really to the point I only remembered what I had. 
I came here with my family one Sunday afternoon during thanksgiving weekend. 
They offer all day breakfast but there's some hamburgers on there for those non breaky type. 
Standard I ordered eggs Benny (someone wise told me you can screw up eggs Benny. I just didn't think at an all day breakfast joint could)
Soft poached egg ended up...well...was what Gordon Ramsey would yell at someone for. The hollandaise sauce was alright, maybe just a tad too thick but taste was ok. I think the saving grace was the home fries. Those were totally cooked though. Nice and soft in the middle yet the outside had a very slight crunch but not burnt or dry. 
Service wise, our waitress was slightly forgetful. Like she would sometimes forget we were there."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last week, and it will be my last. The restaurant was renovated a few years ago, which is the only positive thing I can mention about Watt's. 

I went out for breakfast with family, and the food was terrible. I ordered a stack of pancakes, which tasted very strange- almost sour, with some areas that tasted like tomatoes? The fact that parts of the pancakes tasted like tomatoes suggested cross-contamination with some other meals. 

Two of my family members ordered a breakfast fry-up with sausages, eggs, bacon, and pancakes. They too, also noticed that the pancakes tasted strange.

On top of the weird pancakes, my poor friend, who ordered a chicken pot pie, was ill an hour later after eating. They said the pie seemed like it was microwaved, since it was warm on the edges, but scalding hot on the inside. Some coleslaw came with his meal, and since coleslaw is made with mayonnaise, there's a possibility bad mayonnaise could have made them ill, or something else.

Poor food, and some poor food safety going on here. You might be better off with eating something in the adjacent food court."}
{"text":"Great place, lots of regulars and just normal home style foods (turkey dinner, for instance).  Worth trying."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it has been consistently positive. Service at the greeting was quick. Ordering time was within acceptable status.(less than 4 minutes of being seated). 

Food was delivered accurately as ordered. Eggs were cook to order (which in my opinion is the biggest deal - everyone screws up eggs). 

Potatoes were nicely fresh and crispy. 
Bacon, cooked medium and beautifully done. Tasted really good. 

Coffee was good as well at $2.25. There better be refills at that price. By default they serve cream but I take milk so after a quick request, it was delivered promptly. 

All in all a fantastic experience. 

Good place!"}
{"text":"Service was okay but the food was not very good, at all.  This is my brother-in-law's place to eat so I agreed to go there with him. I had the open face turkey sandwich.  The entire meal was served lukewarm.  That was the first sign.  I really should have sent it back.  The accompanying peas were from frozen without butter or seasoning.  As if you boiled some peas and put them on a plate.  Plain and boring.  The potatoes were instant mashed potatoes (or that's what they tasted like).  The gravy on the sandwich was a cream gravy and had no turkey flavour.  I thought it might be an all purpose gravy that any meal receives.  The turkey dressing contained bits of bacon.  I've not had turkey dressing with bacon.  It made the turkey sandwich taste like bacon.  Hours later I am still burping up my lunch.  The only positive thing I can say is the service was fine and the restaurant looked okay.  Not a pleasant meal.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"My worst culinary experience. I was just in the neighbourhood and we had to grab a bite. I had a philly cheese steak sandwich and I was wondering how they could make something that bad. I am not picky and it's like it had no taste, it had a bad taste. But if you prefer quantity and cheap prices, I guess you can go."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast and food and service is alright. Feels like an iHop in Scarborough :)

Excited to come back when their new location opens up in April"}
{"text":"Hot turkey sandwich ($10) with cranberry sauce, peas plus mashed potatoes and gravy. Portion was great and the taste was delicious.  The cranberry sauce is unique in that it's tangy but not sweet. If you want thanksgiving early, this is the hearty meal you want on a cold Autumn day.

The grilled chicken wrap ($11) was like Chinese food goodness in a delightful wrap. A little greasy but the teriyaki taste was yummy.

They have all-day breakfast?!? Totally coming back!"}
