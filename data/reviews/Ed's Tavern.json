{"text":"The fact that I'm here (average) twice a week might have more to do with proximity than affection, but if this place weren't awesome, I'd go elsewhere.

Great selection of draft beers (including the wonderful 1.75 coors light).

The bar food is good.  I'm partial to the App Sampler (especially at half price on Fridays) and definitely the sliders.

Also, if you're planning on taking the Wing Challenge - don't sit near me - kthx."}
{"text":"This is a total sports bar.  My boyfriend and I met up with another couple here for drinks, and the place was ridiculously packed.  But after a while, the crowd dispersed a bit and was much more manageable.  At that point, we were easily able to find a table and chill out.

Once at the table, we never had a server come by, so it might be that it's all bar service on the weekend.  They have a few pool tables, which is cool.  Also, you have your typical beer list, making this a good standby for a lowkey night."}
{"text":"Mmmm wings! Didn't feel like burning my lips off so I stayed clear of the Chuck Norris wings but did have me some delicious hot wings."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to stop by Ed's because of the lackluster reviews, but I have to respectfully disagree with what I've read.  The staff was very friendly, courteous, and kept my beer mug full. I got the chicken wings and had them \"grilled style\".  They were quite tasty.  The beer was cold and delicious.  The menu and beer listing aren't going to blow you away, but certainly nothing to complain about.  It definitely is a great place to catch the game as they've got plenty to TVs."}
{"text":"If you want to drink a beer and watch a game, this is a good place for you if you're in Dilworth. However, if you're not close to the area and/or are looking to eat, there are far better places to spend your money. 

My friend and I went in for a game recently. We sat down at a dirty table (it was busy and someone just left). When our waitress finally appeared we asked her to clean it. She appears moment later and thoughtlessly sprayed both of our phones in plain sight with whatever cleaner they use to wipe down the previous patron's muck. Didn't apologize, just mindlessly went about doing what I assumed she thought was someone else's job. Now, I can completely understand if a place is slammed like this one was and not getting the fastest service, but our waitress spent time hobnobbin' with her other tables like she was working at Hooters. We were there over two hours and I bet she came to the table three times (someone else brought us our food). Hey, that's not enough to give the place a bad review -- there are good and bad apples in any establishment; I'm giving these guys two stars based on the quality of the food alone. It's easy to pour a beer and that seems to be the level of competence they require in the kitchen. On par with a heat-lamp'd McDonalds' burger. Rubbery. Flavorless. Is this even real meat? My buddy got the wings. We both felt a little queasy afterwards. He doesn't care to go back, but I say trust 'em with the beer. They do have a good selection of drafts and those are reasonably priced. The atmosphere's good if you're into the sports bar vibe."}
{"text":"My fiance and I live down the street, and subsequently spend Friday nights and Sunday mornings at Eds. Their brunch is AMAZING and I'd argue its the best in Charlotte. While the brunch menu is quite limited, the eggs are incredible. Naturally I was eavesdropping a few weeks ago and heard the patrons behind me say that Ed's get their eggs from a local farm. You can tell. The full lunch/dinner menu is pretty good as well. My fiance says they have the best wings he's ever had. My only complaint is that we have waited FOREVER on multiple occasions. If you're in a rush, you might want to think twice. We waited over 30 minutes for our brunch last weekend when there were only a handful of tables open. I'm not sure if its a waitress issue or a kitchen issue, but we've started just sitting at the bar with our favorite waitress (tall, skinny, funny brunette)  who always seems to get our food out right and on time. Sit at the bar if you're in a hurry or don't want to deal with a messed up order."}
{"text":"Complete turn around at Ed's with a huge new outdoor deck to boot.   Food and service is consistently very good whether your outside, or inside at the bar or a table. They have at least 30 craft drafts and at least 15 flat screens inside.  Hope they plan to out some tvs out on the new deck for football."}
{"text":"I love it here they always have fast and friendly service I'm never waiting too long for my food.  The southwestern eggrolls are AWESOME! Oh my goodness they come with two different dipping sauces that compliment their flavor perfectly! Check em out"}
{"text":"Best bar ever! We come here every time we are in town. Great beers on tap. Lots of IPAs, which I love! Hot bartenders, especially Jodene. And they have pop shot basketball!!! What's not to like..."}
{"text":"Good service, well poured drinks, awesome sweet potato fries. Getting the basics right is hard to find."}
{"text":"Really really not good.  Eds used to have the best chicken wings in town and they've totally changed their product. Last couple times we've come the wings are anemic and almost inedible. Staff is polite but doesn't know much about foodservice.  It's a bar."}
{"text":"May 28, 2016 Very rude waitress who falsely accused some guy friends we were with of walking out and not paying our tab. There were three of us still sitting at the table.  She didn't bother to ask us about the tab before she ran out the door and chased our friend down the street accusing him of walking out on his tab. The bouncers were also rude and VERY Unprofessional!  Way to go Ed's!!! Maybe you should train your staff to be more professional!!! Have been to Eds multiple times but VERY DISAPPOINTED  in the inappropriate behavior of their staff tonight!!!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been since ownership changed and won't go back. We left after waiting 30 minutes for a server to notice our table."}
{"text":"Honestly, this was one of the worst experiences ever...for two reasons. 1 - No A/C. It was hot as hell in this restaurant. 2 - The meal was horrible. The steak on the Southwest salad was basically Steak-umms and I literally spit out every piece I tried to eat. Gritty, cheap meat. Nothing quality about the food here. Save your dime. Drink a beer instead."}
{"text":"This is where my best friend and I go on Wednesdays. The standing daily drink specials are fantastic ($2.75 for Killian's on draft and good shot specials, too) and the atmosphere is great. The back patio is big, so you can bring a group if you like, but it's just fine for two or three as well. (Plenty of seating, plenty of room to stand.) And the inside is ENORMOUS with decent billiards and a couple of good arcade games. Plus on Wednesdays there's music trivia. (Live music Fridays, too!)

I've never eaten here, so I can't attest to the quality of the food, but the service and drinks are awesome. Highly recommend for any crowd."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice - the food isn't good. The \"chili cheese fries\" are nothing more than fries, ground beef, and some shredded cheese. I'm not sure how they call the meat mixture chili. Ordered the garlic Parmesan wings - did not taste any garlic, and there was what looked like shredded Harris Teeter Parmesan cheese sprinkled around the wings. Will go back for beer, but definitely not food."}
{"text":"I give up...this place used to be great , the food was always good and we loved the laid back atmosphere but I am officially NEVER eating here again , the food quality has nosedived. I implore you do not waste your money on the wings they are terrible . rubbery, almost undercooked with NO SAUCE ( and this has happened more than once ) if you want real chicken wings try leboswskis they are CONSISTENTLY excellent ..crisp, meaty and saucy. AND they are right around the corner ! And no I don't work there or own it."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you're just looking to chill with a group of friends. It get's fairly busy on Wednesday and Thursday nights for trivia from about 9:00 to 11:00. There is a smaller crowd there on Friday and Saturday nights. On Saturday nights they usually have a small band. The food is just above average for bar food.  They have about 10 decent size flat screen TV's but the picture quality isn't that great. They usually don't turn the sound on for games. They have a back deck/patio and a small front patio with cornhole. They have two pool tables, a few video games, and lots of checker boards. The crowd is usually mid 20's to mid 30's.

The best thing about this bar is the $1.75 coors light drafts."}
{"text":"Ordered fried pickles and got ranch flavored water for dip. Requested blue cheese since the ranch was near water and got more ranch and was charged. Place was empty even after all the renovations. Only plus was the waitress who provided good service. Food is overpriced and no longer the same Ed's that locals would frequent. You don't change what isn't broken."}
{"text":"Great atmostphere! great bar food! if you get the chicken wings ask for extra wing sauce."}
{"text":"A friend took me to this bar recently. The bar has a very chill feel to it-great collection of beers on the tap including local brews..Definitely try the Dunkel & Mexicala..The bartenders are also pretty hot if that helps :)"}
{"text":"Went to Ed's on Thursday night for general trivia.  Website said it started at 8p, when we got there the boards said 9p, trivia man started at 8:38p.

Food: pretty good bar food.  I had a buffalo chicken wrap and sweet potato fries.

Drinks: excellent beer list with many options on tap.

Atmosphere: big space, good location, pool tables and outdoor areas.

Service: good service, friendly staff.

Trivia: Half the people in the place weren't really playing and rules weren't that strict so I think there were some cheaters texting friends and what not.  If you are a stickler for game-focus and rules then you should probably avoid."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, sports bar vibe. Everything we got was solid. Service was friendly. The food came out a little slow, but not too bad. Good neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Ed's Place is cool.  A neighborhood spot definitely, and they have some delicious beer.  I stopped in the other day, mid-October, grabbed a \"Kind Beer\" a high gravity beer and sat outside at the picnic tables enjoying this tasty brew and the Charlotte Fall weather.  The \"Kind Beer\" was inexpensive and very kind, with a taste similar to Sierra Nevada, but with much more of a punch.

My friend and I made this our first stop on a little trek I like to call \"The Bike Bar Crawl\" which basically consists of bars I can ride my beach cruiser to, Ed's Place was stop numero uno. Keep your eyes open for stop 2 and see if you can connect the dots....

P.S. it might be in reverse."}
{"text":"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhh.  That's about all I can say.  Definitely sports oriented and so damn crowded on the weekends it's not even funny.  We got harrassed by some weird guy on the back patio last time we were there who would not leave us alone.  I think there are better places in Charlotte to hang out especially if you don't live near this place.  A neighborhood fave I'm sure, but not for me."}
{"text":"Okay, so it has taken me forever to get out to this place but finally made it a few days ago. It's strange that others have some terrible reviews of this place and from what I hear around town a lot of people certainly don't speak as highly about their experiences here compared to mine. 

We were here on a Wednesday which is apparently one of TWO weekly trivia events held here. The crowd was pretty large but everyone had a table and it didn't seem overcrowded. It's actually worth mentioning that we never once felt we were neglected by our server. In fact, our server offered some of the better service I've experienced in quite some time. We were always asked if we needed an another beer at the perfect time and checked on just enough times without being annoying.

The food here exceeded our expectations by quite a bit. I split the Bleu Cheese Burger and an order of chicken tenders tossed in their hottest hot sauce. As far as I'm concerned they nailed both of these orders. Apparently the burgers are all made in-house (not frozen patties from a distributor) and it certainly made a difference. Flavor of the burger and the addition of the blue cheese was great. The tenders were great as well and I don't think I'd ever recommend tenders without tossing them in some type of sauce.

As for the atmosphere, which I've heard many complain specifically about, I personally saw no problem and actually had a good experience here. It wasn't super dark like many bars of the same caliber in town, the service was great, the food was good and it wasn't super loud at any point. I'll need to pop in here on a weekend to see if the vibe is any different as I'd expect it to be vs. a Wednesday but in general very pleased with this place for a bite to eat and a few beer.

Oh! And it's worth mentioning that it looks like they have some pretty great deals on beer as well as a pretty good selection. Monday's are 1/2 of Drafts AND the same goes for Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. Had the tomato soup and grilled cheese. Delicious for $6!!! Will definitely go back and try other options!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this building since before it was called Eds Tavern back in early 2000's.  Sat at the bar the other night.  The beers, burger, wings, and fried mushrooms are all great.  The menu prices are great and keep me coming back.  The bartenders are attentive and friendly.  5 stars"}
{"text":"Wondering when the blender for frozen drinks will be fixed or ever? I feel like Ed's is one of the few places that has great frozen drinks in the summer but every time we've gone they are unable to make them..."}
{"text":"Just a great bar! Good prices on beer and the food isn't too bad either. Service is always quick 
Great place to watch a game"}
{"text":"Perfect watering hole.   Great food and drinks...always a good spot to start, end or spend an evening."}
{"text":"I think Ed's may be one of the only true neighborhood bars in Charlotte. They have very good bar food at a decent price. They also have a good beer list. They are always having some great specials as well. I have been to there trivia a couple times and it is usually packed. The trivia is one of the best around. We really emjoy playing there Sappo game over there. If you have been there before and never seen it, it's in the corner next to the pool tables. Dont be afraid to try it with some friends. It is a really cool bar game. Ed's tends to be steadily busy every night and the servers are always great."}
{"text":"The tvs were way too loud to have a conversation. The food was pretty good. They have appetizer specials on Friday"}
{"text":"It's a relaxed atmosphere when it's not too crowded.  Johnny Walker, Dewars and Chivas Regal are the only Scotch whisky selections which is unfortunate.  Lots of TV screens for your favorite games.  But I go there because the bartenders are easy going and like to have fun guessing who just played what song on the juke box.  

In this neighborhood, unless I'm craving a burger at Big Daddy's, I actually prefer Ed's to anything on East Boulevard because it's low-key.  East Boulevard focuses too much on frills and you can't sit and relax at Big Daddy's because it's always packed.  Rightly so because the food is great and desperately needed along that strip.  

But Ed's burgers are still great, the crumbly-around-the-edges kind, and appropriately salted.  Their slightly seasoned fries are addictive.  And Comet Grill is ten paces away if you're vegetarian if you prefer to dine there first and then have drinks at Ed's.  Both Ed's and Comet Grill are adjacent to the Bloom parking lot."}
{"text":"Eds is a solid place to go to eat and drink. I went for trivia night and it was a total blast. Great drink specials and the quesadillas are bomb. The service is kind of slow though. I will be back to Eds again for trivia and the awesome quesadillas!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Wednesday lunch shift, took us about 10 minutes to be greeted and there were barely any customers in the restaurant. The server who finally came up to us to get our drink order, acted pretty annoyed that she even had to take a table. My boyfriend ordered a beer and I ordered water..she comes back 15 minutes later with 2 waters and asks us if we are ready to order...we order our food and patiently wait on the beer my boyfriend ordered..finally had to flag her down and ask her for the beer she forgot. She looks at us and says \"ohh...I forgot what beer you ordered\" no apology at all or even the slightest concern she had forgotten about the beer. and for the worst part, it took about 30-40 minutes to get our food.. (Mind you it was about 2:00 on a Wednesday) And it tasted like it sat in the window for 20 minutes. And again, the server never acknowledged how long our food was taking or even showed the slightest bit of concern. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"good service, very nice update esp with patio. wings are great, esp Bourbon sauce. buffalo wings were a bit too tough and salty for me, but hey, that's just me. 
house salad was a good quality,  I like lots of greens so it could be a touch more greens on the dish for 7 bucks.... all in all, I like it, inside and out."}
{"text":"I went here on a Tuesday night, late in the evening. The place was pretty lively and played some good music, with people belting out their favorite cheesy ballads. I had an order of chicken tenders with fries and honey mustard - all of which were superb and mouth-scaldingly fresh! The chicken tenders were not your typical crusty hunks of batter with a little bit of meat in the middle - they were very meaty with a crispy, light coating that had flavorful seasoning. They also had a pretty solid beer selection, even featuring the elusive Red Oak (which I ordered, filled to the brim of the glass). The waitress was very nice and attentive but not annoying. I also enjoyed their pool tables and a game of giant Jenga! Would recommend for anyone looking to go somewhere laid-back and fun with better-than-average bar food."}
{"text":"Went here on Thursday for trivia night. This place has a laid back vibe and was pretty crowded on trivia night. I only tried the hummus plate but it was not bad. All the food looked like good bar food. They have a lot of local beers as well as specials, friendly service too.

Part of an episode of Homeland was also filmed here too so that was pretty neat!

update: have been multiple times since and have tried many of their appetizers and i have not been disappointed. if friend pickles are your thing you should get some here"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed stopping by Ed's for a night cap. I enjoyed the atmosphere, they have a pretty good beer selection, the service was friendly & the live music was great. I want to go back to try the trivia & will definitely keep Ed's in mind the next time we're out in the Dilworth/Sedgefield area!"}
{"text":"Ed's is a great spot to grab a beer and watch the big game. It has a dive bar feel but is very clean and well decorated.I stopped into Ed's during a NFL playoff game and it was packed but they still provided great service. Ed's has a ton of TVs, a very nice outdoor patio, pool tables, and a few arcade games. The prices aren't great but I was impressed by Ed's wings. If there is a popular game on I would get there early, the parking lot fills up quick!"}
{"text":"Wings were good - not as crispy as I would have liked (especially when i asked for extra, extra crispy ;-) but the flavors were good and the specials were great.  $5 mimosas and bloody marys were a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Great choices for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The staff is friendly and helpful . Good beer choices. Some really great weekly specials. 

Breakfast for me is western omelette and bacon. I wish you got a little more bacon for the price.

Great sandwiches for lunch. The soup is always tasty.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Okay 4 stars for the bar and atmosphere, 3.75 stars for the food (the food is good bar food not \"great\" bar food, how do you rate that?;)

First you need to understand that this bar is tucked neatly on the edge of Dilworth, and is very walkable from many of the surrounding homes, thus making it an easy choice for anyone who needs late night grub and or comradery (read people mingle here).  They are open late which is a plus, they have pool tables also a plus, if you like to pick your own music they have a touch tunes device there.  Decent beer selection on tap, if you're a beer snob go somewhere else.  If you like your beer served in buckets maybe this is 4.5 stars for you.  All in all Ed's is fun and the location is great, I expect their new patio will be very popular in the warmer months."}
{"text":"Horrible service with even worse food! Stopped by this past weekend and was asking the server about a drink on special. She told me she had no idea because she was underage. We ordered an appetizer of tachos- they came out with hard cold queso cheese on them. Then we ordered wings for an entree which the server again couldn't answer any questions about the flavor options. They were tough, had several bones throughout and overall not good! I won't be back."}
{"text":"We went with a large group for music trivia on a Wednesday.  The trivia was fun, but in the last round, certainly tilts more towards newer music.  Not entirely, but I would suggest taking a 21 year old who loves rap and Katy Perry to pull out the win!

We didn't eat, but drank our weight in booze.  A good, not great, draft beer selection. 

Would I return for more trivia? Yes. Do I wish the volume level of ambient noise was about 10% of what it was that night?  Definitely!  I mean, I enjoy yelling to  my girlfriend who's sitting 18 inches away from me, but not all night.  

Overall, I'd go back, but not without earplugs during trivia."}
{"text":"The worst food poisoning of my life. Went there last night to watch the Pats vs Steelers game and bought a burger. After about two bites immediately knew something was up with it because it tasted really bad so I had the waiter throw it away after telling her. No manager was notified to my knowledge because I never had a manager come talk to me and yet still had to pay for the burger (Which I think is wrong considering I had two bites and hated it). I've been incredibly sick the past 12 hours. I've tried reaching out to the manager to make him aware twice now with no success. Keep being told he will call me but hours keep passing by with no phone call. Was trying to resolve this with the manager before posting to yelp."}
{"text":"This is you're typical neighborhood bar with pretty good appetizers and sandwiches. It can get a little loud on some nights, so if you're looking for a quiet dinner/drink spot, you may wanna try elsewhere. The service was so-so, but it was pretty busy, so that's understandable. Prices in general and the draft beer selection are pretty average. This is a convenient, last minute kind of place to take friends for food and drinks."}
{"text":"Love Eds.  Great vibe, above average food and DECENT beer specials.  The Ed's Amber is always a steal at $2.  Come for trivia Wednesday or Thursday.  

The only bad thing is the lack of consistency of the wait staff.  80% of the time theyre great.  The other 20% you never see your waitress.

Bottom Line, Go to Eds (Had to give $$ cause you dont go to Eds and not drink)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal at Ed's.  It was the first time I've eaten there.  I had the Southwestern Egg Rolls and they were so delicious.  I'm still thinking about them and that doesn't happen very often with me.  I love good food so I try a lot of different things.  I was there on an evening when the Panthers were playing in uptown Charlotte so the place was packed but the service was still good and the food came out fast.
I will definitely be back to Ed's."}
{"text":"Ed's Tavern is your typical bar. The highlights of the bar was the live band. Also they have several game areas as well ample TVs to watch any sporting event your heart desires. The food is bar food so don't go expecting something that is going to knock your socks off. The bar was very busy and our waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed. We often had to stop her as she walked past our table to place our order. However, when we did have her attention she was awesome. This place is a good way to spend some time watching the game and drinking beer. Eat before you come though."}
{"text":"Loud, chaotic, disorganized -this is your place.  I've never had such cloyingly sweet sweet potatoes & wings were well cooked but where's the flavor.  The most flavorful item for the wings was the ranch. Service was fast but were more interested in regulars than a new customer."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews for the Party on the Patio experience. Amazing atmosphere to enjoy the weather. They should have moved the cornhole down to parking area to make room for more tables. We waited around for a table and finally snagged one but a server never came by. Finally a server came by but only to pick up the check from the table before us and was more than ready to walk off without even acknowledging us. I stopped her and asked if she was our server and she finally sent over our sever. Service from there on out was better. The $5 bloody Mary's were really good, better than the average Bloody Mary special. They offer a lot of drafts betters too! The patio is big and nice but over all there is definitely room for important!"}
{"text":"I left Charlotte 7 months ago and every weekend I try to find a neighborhood gem that compares to Ed's. Ed's was and is my favorite bar. Coors light always on special made drinking all day at a bar with friends a fun experience that wouldn't empty the savings account. I spent every Panthers away game there. Saturday college football was perfect at Eds. They never let one team hog too many of the TVs. It's what a sports bar should be. 


Oh yea the wings were solid too."}
{"text":"Have been here many times and all have been mediocre to awful. I've had a hard time putting my finger on it and I think it finally came to me after this last visit. Onsite management is absolutely awful.  

The waitresses seem to hate working there and are understaffed. No items can be sent back to the kitchen under any circumstance. A plate laid is a plate paid!  The hostess has to also serve as the runner, and she does not have time to check the accuracy of the orders (literally every food item we ordered was missing something or was just wrong).  

The GM there should really be ashamed of their performance. Not professional at all."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get all kinds of bar food, and to make you feel better about eating it, everything here is freshly prepared (they don't use frozen or canned food).  I recommend the burger, chicken caesar wrap, and the chicken fingers basket.  They are open for lunch, dinner, and late-night. The food is great, and they have have decent drink specials (if nothing else Coor's Light draft is always a $1.50).  The only negative I have about this place is that since they are a new restaurant they seem a little overwhelmed.  It can get really crowded, especially on game day, and the service can be really slow.  

After living next to Ed's for the last several months, I will add that I think the service has gotten worse, something always seems to be wrong.  Also, because of decent drink prices, there are a lot of douche bags here on thurs-sat nights.  Oh, and if you sit at a table at night, don't go to the bar to order your drinks or the waitres will get pissed!"}
{"text":"Great bar and atmosphere. Food is good, what you would expect from a charlotte staple. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"All of the other reviews do a really good job covering this place. When a friend recommended it I was not sure what to expect. I came away very impressed."}
{"text":"When I used to live in Southend, I LOVED Ed's. I would go there at least once a week. The games, the crowd, the food, and the staff all made the place so awesome! It pains me to write this review, but with the staffing changed I feel I have to tell Yelpers about my awful experience. I went with a group of 10 people just to have some drinks this past Friday. The specials were $5 well drinks (again, thank you Ed's), and I was having a hard core love fest with the Tatchos. My issue came when I got the bill. By accident, the bartender had put my friend's drinks on my bill. Usually no issue. However, another bartender had already charged them for their drinks and this bartender was refusing to change it. Heather, the bartender, introduced herself, and instead of thinking there was a mistake, she patronized me in front of my friends and said \"honey you didn't drink just two drinks, you had four and a beer\". For one, I had two drinks because I was the DD of the night. If you want to tell me I inhaled all of the tatchos, GUILTY as charged, but don't tell me I had more to drink than I already did. I explained to her that my bill should only be $18 instead of $50+ and she again patronized me and said \"Honey (again, what is with that word?!), I AM sober. You had more to drink\". My fiancé and friends all saw my drinks, and although they tried to vouch, Heather wasn't having it. I was starting to feel crazy. I don't care if I drank the drinks, but if the exact drinks I'm over is the exact beer/cocktails that are on another tab, don't you think it might be best to at least investigate with the other bartenders and not make a customer feel lower than dirt?
She made me feel like I was losing it, embarrassed me in front of my friends by the way she talked to me, and was overall a poor customer experience. I've never been treated so poorly! I asked to speak to a manager and she told me that it was too late and she already ran my card, to please sign because she was too busy to \"handle this situation\".
Ed's, you have truly broke my heart. If it wasn't for your Tatchos, I would have given you one star, but that's not fair. Your staffing has changed for the worst and although Heather the bartender offered to give me \"Several drinks\" next time I came in, I doubt she would a) remember me or b) hold up a promise.
Sigh."}
{"text":"Born and raised Eds. Tonight the chips were stale and the buffalo chicken dip was full of blue cheese, which, when described on the menu, consisted of chicken, cream cheese and famous buffalo sauce. I have faith they'll pick back up, but they still need time"}
{"text":"$1.50 Coors Light Pints everyday.  Chicken sandwich with cucumber salad to eat."}
{"text":"Great food and great drink choices. This place used to be one of my favorite bars. It kind of has a divey-sports bar feel (but very clean). The regulars used to be 20-somethings just looking to chill, but the crowd has gotten a lot older and in my opinion, a lot more boring. It is a nice spot to grab a drink and dinner, but it is now more of a 30 and 40-something professional bar. Trivia and Music Trivia are ok, but they take way too long between rounds and it starts really late."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood hang out! Definitely a locals place and usually packed on evenings and weekends. Decent craft beer selection with a couple dozen on draft and several bottle selections too. Food is also very good but typical bar fare."}
{"text":"Ed's is a your typical neighborhood sports bar. 

It's packed during football games and other big sporting events. And you'll find what you'd expect on those days - lots of obnoxious drunk guys.

But I recently went there on a sunny Thursday afternoon and had a great time sitting on the back patio. I tried the veggie wrap and the mozzarella sticks for an appetizer. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this local spot by chance mid-afternoon Saturday, and will certainly return on purpose, even though we do not live nearby.  Fun, local sports bar - a real one - not the typical \"franchise / chain\" wannabe manufactured digs or phoney atmosphere.  For you sports fans, TV's are everywhere.  For you beer fans, I counted 31 tap handles.  If your nickname is \"Minnesota\", they also have pool tables!

Food was particularly good at mid-afternoon - a good sign that their kitchen stood ready during an off-hour.  Wife had a very generous portion of pulled pork - nothing really special - but it was good quality and nicely presented. Portion was plenty to eat there plus some to take home!

Fish-and-chips for me, and it was GREAT!  Had it many times in British pubs, and Ed's version was quite authentic - other than it was served on a plate vs. newspaper.  An observation - not a criticism - I will eagerly order it again next time.  My generous portion of fish was fresh, too hot to eat when served, (a very good thing) and perfectly battered and fried. Chips were also too hot to handle and perfectly crispy.  Burgers at next table also looked tempting.

My spicy - don't be shy - Bloody Mary(s) had a perfect kick!  Waitress was perky and appropriately attentive.  Mixed and comfortable crowd mostly 20/30s mixed with a few of us in the card-carrying Medicare vintage.  Crowd was enjoying the place - nobody seemed out of place regardless of age.  We originally thought the place was empty since parking is in the rear.

We will return, and I suggest you try it!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out last night for the first time with my gf and some friends. Carly was the bartender and I placed an order of wings and onion rings with her. She brought out the wings but the onion rings hadn't come out so I waited a few minutes thinking they were taking a bit. Eventually I walk up to the bar and ask about them and she proceeds to tell me she never put them in so I was a bit disappointed since I had been craving some onion rings. It wasn't busy! It was a Monday night and I simply ordered two things so not sure how she could have messed that up being it such and easy order! No excuse there. Then I order a gose sour ale beer on tap and she gives it to me in a 10 oz beer glass so I ask what the abv is on it and she says 6%. I'm pretty sure high gravity beers of 7% or higher are served in 10 oz glasses not gose beers. I look up the abv on the beer and it turns out it's only 5%. So not only did I miss out on 6 oz of beer but it was supposed to be $1 off local beers night and that wasn't taken off my check. So I paid almost $6 for 10 oz of beer. I close out my tab and  was nice enough to leaver her a 15% tip which she didn't deserve and go out to finish my beer on the patio and then had the decency to come back in with the 10 oz glass and return it to the bar where I politely mentioned the fact that the beer I had was actually only 5% abv and shouldn't be served in that glass for future reference. She didn't seem too happy and got an attitude with me and told me she had to serve it in that glass. Anyways I walked away and left. Then I get in the car with my buddy and he proceeds to tell me she charged him $35 for a pitcher of red oak beer which he only got 4 beers out of! He was livid but didn't mention anything to her because he had friends with us from out of town and didn't want to make a scene. That's almost $9 a beer. The purpose of pitchers are too save money not get gauged and over charged!!! I couldn't believe it. I wish he would have mentioned it to me because I would have said something for him! Outrageous. I can't believe she had the nerve to actually charge him that. Unbelievable. If you want to get crappy service, get over charged for stuff and then get hit with attitude from their employees then this place is for you! Definitely wouldn't recommend this place and we won't be visiting ever again!!"}
{"text":"So I came here last night with my boyfriend and the entire the staff of the restaurant he works at for an after holiday party drink. We had joined everyone at ten park lanes on Montford after he got off work but as they were wrapping everything up since they were closing we decided to go with everyone to Eds so that he could enjoy a little time with his coworkers and not to mention also provide a little help transporting people since everyone else had already been there and were already pretty drunk. 

Well we walk in and order a round of drinks (only our 2nd drinks of the evening btw) and I told my guy I would be right back I had to use the restroom I'm just getting over this nasty cold that seems to have everyone and their mother sick so I'm in the bathroom blowing my nose for probably the 7000th time and when I walk out of the bathroom I'm greeted by a woman who was either a bartender or a manager doesn't matter and another staff member AS WELL as a bouncer! The woman standing in front asks me if I'm ok can she get me any help of any kind I'm like no I already ordered my drinks I'm fine thank you??? Really confused but oh well. She then tells me they heard me getting sick and had to make sure I was alright! Ok thats intrusive but nope not getting sick I was blowing my nose can't see how those things sound similar but ok. I walk away from them to join the party and I watch her go behind the bar and tell the bartenders to cut me off! I then turn around to see the bouncer who has decided to tell my boyfriend he has to leave and is escorting him out the BACK door!!! They told me he was too intoxicated and that he could no longer remain on the property, and I suppose he's also a bag of trash that they needed to take out seeing as how they felt the need to escort him out the back door and not ask him to walk out the front door we walked through 5 mins ago! No no no not happening I grabbed my guys arm and pulled him back in and told them we would be more than happy to walk ourselves out the door WE CAME IN and never walk back in it either. 

Ok so first off neither one of us were any where even in the vicinity of being drunk it was also incredibly embarrassing for the staff to make such a scene when they were so in the wrong! Never mind the fact that they clearly wouldn't know a drunk person if they hit them in the face! The group we came in with were definitely drunk! I know I drove them there! But they were provided rounds of shots and beers upon entrance no questions asked! The one and only other time this has happened to us was a similar situation with SIP uptown we took an Uber for our first stop and first drinks of the night again told we couldn't drink somewhere because we seemed drunk already but at least SIP had the balls to make it abundantly clear it was about appearance and didn't wait for us to spend any money in their establishment first. 

And now after reading over a few of the other reviews of this place it's clear this isn't their first offense and probably won't be their last. But to be clear the staff is rude and unprofessional and I highly highly suggest you take your hard earned money elsewhere to a different bar or restaurant that will treat you with respect and not judge you/embarrass you or try to take you out the back like a bag of trash. Shame on your staffs behavior Eds tavern but thank you for showing your true colors so that neither myself nor any of my other close friends ever spends a minute of our time or money with you."}
{"text":"Five stars for being Ed's again!   The best wings and neighborhood bar in Dilworth."}
{"text":"Ed's a great place to go watch the Panthers games.  You can either sit in the restaurant at a table/booth, the bar, or the outside bar and patio.  The outside patio is filled with TVs so you'll be able to catch whatever game you're interested in.  Buckets of beer are around 15 dollars and they kept the drinks coming all day long for our group of 10.  We shared about 6 appetizers between the table and everything was delicious.  The only complaint I have about this place is that parking can be difficult during game day or a big game.  I had to park in the grocery store parking lot but it's not that far away. It is also extremely loud but what do you expect on game day when everyone is there to watch! There is also a pool table available in the front. 

Great service and food.  I will be back to watch more Panthers games!"}
{"text":"I always love coming here. The food is good and the atmosphere is laid back. I never review on these things but that's how awful my experience was! After putting my money into one of the pool tables I wasn't able to play. I put my money into another table and a ball was missing. Management did come to fix it promptly.. but my server Kelly was as stuck up as they come! I witnessed her chatting and sitting down with one table for at least 10 minutes while I waited to get her attention. When I finally did ask about my food to go she replied that I had chicken and since it's raw it takes longer to cook. Not more than 2 minutes the bartender brought out my food. She never asked how my food was or even bothered with me in general. I love this place but their staff needs improvement!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday with a friend at about 6pm, prime dinner hour. It seemed pretty slow though it started to pick up around 7:30 as we were leaving. It was close to 100 degrees in Charlotte today so the new back patio was close to empty. I expect the deck to get busier in the evenings with cooler temps. She got the chicken tender plate, I did the mushroom Swiss burger with fries. Most entrees will run in the $9.50 - $13.00 range. I typical don't take the easy way out on reviews but everything about my visit was \"average\". No complaints on the staff, beer selection, parking, prices, etc. - The real draw for this place would be if there was a sporting event on you'd want to watch. Some of the best TV's for game watching near South End."}
{"text":"Good food, nice people..the waitress was amazingly friendly and attentive. The beer was a little warm for my taste..Beer on tap should be below 40 degrees. my guestimation would be about 45 degrees?"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour bar, late night bar and everything in between!  Go Friday nights and they will have a live band (but it is always too loud for this old lady's ears!)  The food here is fantastic, I have had the chicken wrap and it is always a ton of food for not a lot of money.  There are fun arcade-type games in the back and plenty of seating.  They always have really sweet bartenders and servers.  Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"This place gives Greece a run for its money for how poorly ran it is and as a Greek...that hits close to home!  I heard Ed's Tavern was a staple for the Dilworth area but instead it's been a staple for lousy service, slow drink orders and average food.  Sad!  This must be the stomping grounds to the Carolina Panthers' offensive line since they have so much in common.  The only thing I can honestly say about this place is that it has a great deck.  Although at times I am hoping I pass out from heat stroke in order to avoid paying for the service I unfortunately received.  Sad!  

Also, don't ask to move any tables together, it causes more trouble than it's worth.  Any person would think a server would be happy/open/willing to accommodate a group that had more coming, with the mindset it would led to higher earnings/ tips, wrong.  Instead our group got an ear full as the waitress mouthed off like a teenager at Claire's that doesn't get her way.   Truly shows the type of character they have working here.  I also must note, this is not the first time I've had bad service, it happens every time and I'm sure while you are reading this review on the Light Rail, ask the person next to you if they have experienced the same thing, I'll wait.  Told you so...  

Keep the deck and fire the rest, that is the improvement I can give you Ed's Tavern.  Make it a place people from Dilworth are proud of, make it a place of good food, make it a place of good service. Make it great again."}
{"text":"I live within walking distance to Ed's and I haven't been there too often; however, I have become a sucker for their wings.  I love their Blackened Parm. wings.  Such a great flavor and their ranch dressing is just yummy!  Whenever I'm craving wings, I head to Ed's!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of hosting my CD release party at Ed's this week. I definitely made the right choice by selecting Ed's over a number of other Charlotte venues I considered. From start to finish I had a very good experience and many of the folks attending the concert commented about the good service. All the staff were helpful, friendly and efficient. Ed's has a lot of space inside with many TVs and the expansive deck out back is a great place to relax outside.

Ed's is a comfortable, fun place. I definitely recommend that you visit soon."}
{"text":"Tap menu is great, gets super busy 8p-11p. 2 pool tables, trivia weds and thurs. Bar food is average. Clientle is 21-32 year olds. Have always had problems here with jerk guys, but the staff is always good about giving idiots the boot.

Never would choose to go here, but if everyone else wants to go, just rest assured you'll have a great beer!"}
{"text":"I really like Ed's.  They have great bar food and awesome drink specials.  I love being able to sit in a booth and relax or if I am in a social mood grab one of the high top tables. They have pool tables and often have live music.  When they do its always been great!"}
{"text":"A real dive bar in the heart of rich people. You might recognize it from homeland. Brody tells mike it's ok to give his wife the business. It has the widest bar I have ever seen it's about 3 feet. Good beer selection with plenty of local nc beers. Good food I like the wings and the backyard burger. The waitstaff is nice and the keep tabs on you which is big for me. We don't come here as much as I would like hopefully that will change!"}
{"text":"So  so. Not the same eds. Need Improvement.  Service great. Atmosphere good. Food lacking."}
{"text":"I feel weird saying it, but I honestly love Ed's. It's an easy and comfortable place to hang out, especially if you go during off-times. I love taking up a booth on a Saturday afternoon and people-watching. Plus, the nachos are some of the best I've had so far in Charlotte. Service is usually pretty good. If you're over 25, just avoid Ed's on Friday nights/big game days - unless you're looking for that kind of thing -  and you'll be happy with your experience."}
{"text":"Ugh so disappointed with Eds Tavern. I have been so excited to come here because being from NY I pretty much love anything NY related so it makes me sad that this is a Giants bar and I really have no interest in coming back. 

From the moment we walked in I almost felt unwelcome. No one said anything to us. We walked up to the bar and the bartender was extremely rude. She took our order but was not happy about it. After we got out drinks, we were standing, watching the game because there was no room to sit. Waitresses kept walking past us, brushing us every time without saying a word. One time one of them actually hit into one of my friends and made her spill half her drink without even an apology. I was less than pleased to say the least with this experience. We quickly finished our drinks and left. 

I unfortunately won't be back to Ed's Tavern any time soon."}
{"text":"Gave trivia night another shot at Ed's... I think last time the trivia was a bit hard and it was hard to not notice the scores of people looking up answers on their smart phones.  Luckily the phone policy has been \"reinforced\" or it seemed like it was.  Trivia should be better if you actually know the answers!  Not how well you can use your smart phone.

Anyways - I got there early and ate at the bar waiting for my friends to show up.  The barkeeps were nice and also let me change a tv to watch a different sport than they had up there.  They have a ton of tvs so it's hard to miss any sort of sports action going on.

Had the fish tacos, which were nice... I liked that the tacos were \"pre-limed\" so it had a good citrus kick to it (without having to get your fingers all limey).  Maybe it's just the laziness in me, but I appreciate when the chef/cook/kitchen says, \"this is what you are eating... you have no options\"  I think there is a boldness about it.  From there it can go either two ways - you absolutely hate what was given to you, or bask in it's greatness.

My side was the cucumber salad... which I didn't care for.... sliced cucumbers with paprika and vinegar... was a bit soggy and sad.  I did eat it all (begrudgingly) .

Trivia was fun and we even won a round of beers!  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Ed's Tavern. The manager made sure to accommodate me and my friends who were all vegetarian for a get-together that we had. It was such a fun atmosphere and the waitress, Rachel, was well versed in the menu and quite charming. Thanks Ed's Tavern for a great time!"}
{"text":"I think Ed's is a great neighborhood bar to go watch the game and relax.  The TV's are pretty good for a bar and they usually have some kind of band on the weekends if you like live music.  

The beer specials are really good.  I think Coors Light is on tap for $1.50 everyday so you definitely can't beat that.  They also have other premium beers at very reasonable prices.  I have only eaten here a time or two, mostly just go there to hang out with friends and have a few beers.  

I did recently have the Spicy Roast Beef Sandwich special for $6 and I have to say it was really good.  Buttery toasted bread, warm roast beef with melted cheese and some kind of spicy sauce that was excellent.  It also came with fresh made potato chips.  I was impressed to say the least!"}
{"text":"Normally I have no problems with Ed's Tavern, but the lack of service today was pretty bad. My friend & I sat at the bar around 12:30 & were left high & dry for about eight minutes. Being quite hungry & thirsty, we decided to leave & go somewhere else. I was really looking forward to a bunch of delicious hot wings and vodka drinks at Ed's today, but the staff on hand did not provide those things. I'd really hate to cross Ed's off my list, but if the service is as bad the next time as is was today I certainly will."}
{"text":"Always a good place to grab a snacka and a cold beer. Last night I took a friend from Oregon to bar and we had the wings. They were great. Meaty cooked just right. They have an interesting flavor \"Blackened Parmesan Cheese\"... TASTY, just the right amount of spice and cheesy flavor.
My wife LOVES the homemade Hungarian Cucumber Salad. 
Great selection of beer and the place is just hopping on Thursday nights and through the weekend.
Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Love this spot as long as you come before 11pm as their full menu is on point. The staff is friendly and attentive.  Just wished they would have not run out of a couple of menu items, but the suggestions were outstanding.  We will definitely visit often."}
{"text":"Like to play games? Watch sports? Eat? Drink beer? Live music? Trivia? Take honey bun shots? Here's the place to do it all.

My crew ventures here often. Our latest adventure was Saturday afternoon. March Madness on the TVs, 30-some year olds gambling over who's better at the hoop shoot out game. If a read head named Ford challenges you, run. He's automatic at that game. Checkers, skee ball, pool, Kenny Floyd providing the tunes. A good time as always.

We are huge fans of the Sapo frog coin toss game. We'll spend hours playing. Addictive. I've yet to see anyone actually get it in the frog's mouth. TWSS?

What to order: I love the wings and the fish tacos. I don't recommend the cucumber salad. Not the best. 

Trivia on Wednesday and Thursday nights. Music on Wednesday, general on Thursday. Get there early to grab a table. I consider myself a somewhat intelligent person. I did not feel that way after a night of general trivia. Live music on Fridays and Saturdays.

Great beer selection. Food and drink specials throughout the week. Ed's even has an app you can download for the latest on that.

Just a short cab ride from uptown and South End, Ed's is a solid spot in the heart of Dilworth."}
{"text":"You won't find a better local non-corporation owned bar in Charlotte with better food. Try the whole menu. I've had most things menu items here but the wings in any flavor and the burgers are legit! Located in a great comfy neighborhood and I really like the layout here for sports."}
{"text":"Great service, good drink specials and lots of TV's to watch games great food get \"a basket of Bacon\" (maple/ honey) or the southwest egg rolls!! Yum"}
{"text":"We drove by this place twice and circled the parking lot on a third drove-by before finally getting the corkage to go in. We heard Ed's Tavern had the best wings from a friend who was a precious Charlotte resident. We gave it a try and ARE SO GLAD we did!!! The blackened Parmesan wings, extra crispy were delicious! They had the perfect amount of crisp, were still so moist, and the Parmesan was flavorful. I ordered a mix of the teriyaki wing with garlic and OMG were they good! The ranch and blue cheese are made in house and are unbelievable. We will DEFINITELY be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"What a great little divey bar to come to and get drinks, lots of entertainment between tvs, games to play, patio area, etc..  Ill be back!"}
{"text":"ED'S TAVERN...... = CHEER'S

i go enough and taken enough friends where they call me the Mayor!
I'm more of a \"shot\" taker than a Drink Drinker. (quick and to the point). anyway... 
They are poured into a Nice Ball glass. When i first started coming here i thought the bartender was just blessing me (for a better tip). When he sat it down and walked off, i felt on top of the Bar (world). 

Unnnnntil i see him pour the same kinda shot to everyone else. HMMMMM maybe its not me!! lol


*********************** BEER *****************

good choice of beer's, on tap, bottles, can (12oz & Tall Boys)
Good specials on beers & drinks (daily) 
Colddddd beer
Not watered down cocktails
A wide selection of Liq. 

********************** Bartenders/Waitress *****************

Smiling Faces
I think its a Bartender named Mike that must be Russian (no smiles..EVER!!)
A Lot of blondes \"bouncing\" around the place to give it a \"Hooters\" effect.
Always happy to help

********************** FOOD *******************

I don't expect much from Bars when it comes to bar food. So i usually order Wings & Fries (you have to work HARD to mess that up). But I've seen other ppl's orders come out and they look pretty good.... CONSIDERING

(I come to drink and maybe eat... so i'm only giving a review of the food and service.. not the \"night life\")"}
{"text":"I love Ed's! It's one of my favorite places in Charlotte. Good times and great friends. It's a local neighborhood bar where everyone knows your name. I feel like its a hidden Gem of Charlotte. It's tucked away off of Park Road and Ideal Way in the Sedgefield community. Great indoor/outdoor seating as well as amazing drink specials. One my favorite things about Ed's is the Skiball amachine! SKIBALL FOR FIREBALL!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I absolutely LOVED it!!! From the staff, to management (Dion!) and the food/drinks! I asked our bartender (Lexi) if I could have my wings tossed in two different flavors (hot and old bay) and she made it happen!! So amazing!! And their frozen drinks, ON POINT! I will definitely be returning here :) *patio is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I love this spot for solid bar food and beer! It's nestled in Dilworth, but there's ample parking for you and your friends! There's plenty of TV's to catch everyone's favorite team, and there's also a ton of games to keep you occupied. They also have trivia one night during the week, and it gets packed! I can't attest to everything on the menu, but everything that I've had has been tasty. I highly recommended the spinach and artichoke dip, it's creamy and full of artichokes. Their tots are tasty too, and really, who doesn't love tots?"}
{"text":"Best place for Sunday football in charlotte. I love the atmosphere here and they have $2 beers. The food here is really lacking compared to other bars and the vibes of this place makes up for it. Overall I love this place during NFL season."}
{"text":"Being from out of town for a weekend we (4 ladies) decided to grab a drink and eat. Walking in there was not a greeting we sat down and looked over the menu asked for options and the waiter had no clue about their own menu, even with the drink selections. We ended up ordering cocktail drinks that seemed to be a simply drink but everyone of our drinks did not taste good at all."}
{"text":"I went on game day the the place was packed. To bad the staff was rude as shit. This is to bad because I heard this is a NY Giants bar.  This New Yorker isn't happy"}
{"text":"The fact that this place gets so busy is beyond me. The food is bland and over rated. The beer selection is from 3 years ago and unimpressive. Not to mention we were in there at 10:30 and the lights were all the way up it was uncomfortable. Service was nothing to call home about, I wish I could tell you our servers name but she never told us and on top of that our drinks ran out and she never asked if we wanted another she just dropped off the check when we had 1/4 of our food left. Clearly feeling unwanted we paid our bill and left and haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Been there several times for drinks and food.  Consistently good service, and a fun crowd.  Feels like there is always something going on, and a good choice for late night food as well - although the late night menu is limited.  If there is any down side, I think the wings are not a great choice - they tasted great, but they are very small and mostly bones.  Overall, multiple good experiences at different times and different days -  worth a visit, for sure."}
{"text":"Come back Eds. We know that you are still hanging on. They took away your free pool and the awesome tradition that is Eds. But worst of all. The upmost worst, terrible thing they could do to you is take away the famous $2 Ed lager. That beer kept my roommates and I coming back every week. If your hearing this and still hanging on come back to us Eds this neighborhood needs you!"}
{"text":"Food and beer is great.  However they have a giant patio in the back.  It's 10:15pm on a beautiful Saturday night.  Management just asked everyone outside to go inside.  Total fail.  What's the point of the patio?"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar! Definitely nothing fancy, but a great dive bar. I'm not sure Id eat here, but they have great local beers and a decent liquor section. I look forward to the new patio!"}
{"text":"Mmmm mmm chicken wings! probably some of the best wings I've ever had; so flavorful, so delicious. Ed's is a good low-key hangout; the perfect place to kill that midweek mundanity (if that's even a word!) 
But you know exactly what I mean. On a Wednesday evening, when you're getting out of work, a chilled beer, some wings or a burger, and some music trivia in a friendly, lively environment is just what you need to lift your spirits... and that's exactly what you'll find at Ed's!"}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and fun! They have a nice patio out back and seating outfront, large on the inside. They have *excellent* drink specials and a good amount of TVs to watch the games. They have pool, corn hole, skee ball, basketball and a few other games, also have a checkers bar so you can sit drink and play. Their food is decent, I usually stick to burgers/wings."}
{"text":"Ed's has been a go to spot for Panthers games this year, and all I can say it is a great spot for Sunday football.  Not only do they have plenty of TV's, I love the set up of the tables. Pretty much anywhere you seat, bar, high table or booth you are in a prime spot for seeing a game. And, when I say game it is because they have several on different TV's.  The Bloody's Mary's are a perfect start to the day and on to their large selection of beers, tab, bottle and even can special.
I have had a few food items, pimento cheese dip, chicken fingers, wings and some eggrolls. Everything has always been on point and the service has as well.
With the new/updated patio coming I am looking forward to more times at Ed's."}
{"text":"IF you: 
(1) want to have a few drinks
(2) want to watch some sports/TV at the same time
(3) want the option of eating some nice, juicy, filling, happily unhealthy, food
(4) want to people watch
(5) want the option of sitting indoors in a typically loud bar OR outside in a cool open area
(6) don't care if you get 5 star service at all times

Ed's is your place. It is exactly what you would expect - and that is why I love it. Unpretentious, fun, consistent...bar. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I know this is a popular neighborhood stomping ground for some. And honestly I like the low key vibe, just chilling' kinda joints. Drinks here are affordable.  All in all not bad of a hangout.  It can get super loud when a band is playing (they should reconsider having just acoustic live music, or at least not a full drum set as an alternative to going deaf).

So why 1 star?  Well, after witnessing a beat down delivered by an employee against a patron, I honestly don't have anything good to say about this place. (This said event took place before the new year FYI)

After several bad press events last year (including a death), you would think someone would care about the reputation and image of the business.  All I know is while I was standing around near the bar, a loud commotion took place at the middle table (where the checker boards table top are). The door/bar back guy punched the guy who was sitting there in the face so hard, there were blood splattered across almost the length of that long table.  The wife was screaming. The rest of the bar male employees jumped on in and dragged this one guy out to the back. Gosh knows what happened to that man.  Wife was hysterical, and she kept being yelled at by the male employees while she repeatedly said stop beating him he didnt do anything.  WTH just happened?! 

Then it gets better.  The guy who did the face punching now storming back in and yelling at everyone on his way, including me and the people I was standing with, for standing around.  He yelled \"this is not your f-king living room, get the f out of the way\". Hmm... This is a bar, people stand around in a bar.  Am I the delusional one?  

So I could only guessed that he punched someone because that someone was in his way, didn't move and might have mouthed back. My thing is, if you don't like dealing with people, especially intoxicated people, don't work at a bar.  There is ZERO reason why any employee should or need to punch anyone. 

Management, if you are reading, please don't hire people who have anger management issue. IT IS NOT OKAY, and ganging up on one person isn't okay either.  I go to bars to have fun and enjoy myself.  And I was quite scared and pissed off by that night event.   Maybe they can put up a sign \"Come here at your own risk...\""}
{"text":"Always a great place to have some late night fun. A wide selection of beers on tap to hydrate before the next round hoops. The place is about due for a new AC unit; the bathrooms probably could double as a sauna. Overall enjoy grabbing a late night snack here and excited to try out the expanded patio once it's done!"}
{"text":"We came out with a couple of friends this Sunday to check out the patio party around 4:45p. Boy, was it packed. Went inside for to ask about specials, $5 mimosas and bloody marys plus some beer specials. I ended up sticking with the bloody marys, so flavorful and spicy! Love it! What a good buy for $5, will be ordering this when I come back. They could have had a better table arrangement to fit more tables and chairs for the growing crowd, but we managed to score a small table after no more than 10 minutes of waiting. The table still had the last person's trash and check which we thought ok, no problem, the server will pick it up. But, we didn't get acknowledged for 15 minutes, not even a look or glance. The trash just sat there, till we actively flagged someone down. And even then, she clearly did not want to be there/talk to us. Our server was nice but, not very attentive. Understandable given the amount of people opting for table service on the patio. Step up the service, I get its packed but if you are going to offer table service, then do it properly, without making the customers feel like a chore. We ordered the pretzel with jalapeño beer cheese and tatchos to share, both were yummy and fairly big. Good bar food. 

I would suggest getting here around 6:30-7p if you want to enjoy the patio, the upcoming summer will not be forgiving to those who sun burn easily. Parking is also tough, they have a lot in the back but it gets packed like the patio itself."}
{"text":"I've been to Ed's 15+ times, and every time it has gotten worse and worse. The only reason I've kept going back is it is .4 of a mile from my house, and as long as you don't mind waiting 30 minutes to ever get acknowledge as a customer, it's not so bad.

Since the new ownership took over, and name change and re-change, the staff has been not only slower but exponentially more rude as well. Last night we waited over an hour for food, at 8PM on a Sunday, and our waitress never once checked on us. After an hour, half of our food was delivered, and then they were delivering food to other tables before bringing ours out. Once we complained for the third time, the manager came out and flat out lied that our food was being plated (the second time they told us that lie). However I could see him asking the cooks where the food was. He then proceeds to tell us their ticket machine went down. Why didn't our waitress check in ONCE over the hour wait, or have the decency to tell us that?!

To say I'll never go back, even with friends to just grab a beer, is an under statement. Ed's used to be such a bar with great food and great service, I'm not sure what exactly happened!"}

The best night of the week is Wednesday Night when they have music trivia from 9pm-11pm. You can have as many people on your team that you want, cell phones are not permitted, and there is always a theme! There is 3-rounds of challenging songs for you to guess the title and artist: first round is pretty easy, second gets more challenging, and the third is when you send up one person from your team to face off at who's the quickest to say the correct artist out loud! The host is great and I love that no matter what creative team name you come up with he must say it! And trust me people get creative.

Team Names I've Heard Used Here: 
My Grandma can't fight, but you should see her box
I like my President like I like my coffee
Drinks Are On the House Tonight
My Couch Pulls Out But I Don't
I wish this microphone was a dick
Titanic Swim Team
I didn't slap you, I just high-fived your face
I Twittered All Over Her Facebook
I like my president like I like my coffee
I'm not gay, but 5 bucks is 5 bucks


*Best Tip for this place: They have a Banana Beer on Draft, You're welcome."}
{"text":"Great beer prices, great selection, surprisingly good food. Never been there for late night but during the afternoon things are tame, cops are patrons, and we get good service a good experience for a good price. Nothing amazing but reliability and value go a long ways."}
{"text":"For what it advertises, Ed's delivers. Good drink deals, solid bar food, and some decent bar games. The Waitress was great and very attentive, going as far as bringing my beer outside. The bar could use a few more TVs, a shuffle board table, but all in all its a solid neighborhood spot."}
