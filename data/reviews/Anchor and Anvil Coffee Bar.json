{"text":"Good coffee bar with nice decor. They open garage doors in warm days for open air but shaded seating. Not a lot to eat though (scones, bagels and fruit smoothies).  With a little more expanded food menu, 5 stars.  I very much enjoyed my Americano and mango smoothie. Scone was good too although not made on site."}
{"text":"Quality is the first thing you will notice with this coffee had it once and immediately became my favorite coffee spot. It's a very modern and cool environment good for anything the owner is very nice and takes his coffee serious. Be sure to try the Parking Chair for an amazing iced coffee!"}
{"text":"I like it here. It's a really nice place to sit and chill, the natural lighting is awesome. The coffee is okay, not the best nor the worst. I've never had the food but a friend I went with said it was great!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service! Went with a colleague for the first time today, the facility was extremely clean and new. You could smell the coffee before walking in! Many sweet treats and healthy treats too! I had a wrap and iced coffee, it was all delicious! Check them out!"}
{"text":"Nice addition to the town with a great atmosphere, including garage doors.  Unfortunately, I have tried the chai tea - iced & hot and did not care for either one.  Just tasted way too milky with no flavor.  Tried 2 smoothies - lime and strawberry.  Lime - had lots of crushed ice; this is supposed to be a smoothie not an icee.  Then the strawberry tasted as if there was a cup of sugar in it; it was that sweet.  Not to mention on each visit when I got the smoothie they were pouring from a plastic bottle, like a Dole fruit juice bottle;  not sure what else went in it, couldn't see. Had the biscotti and a few other sweets that were good, but the coffee house brings them in from elsewhere such as Enrico Biscotti in the Strip.  Not a coffee drinker, so not sure about that."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this coffee shop! I've gotten an iced latte and an iced matcha latte before, and both were great. The store is open and spacious and has really great natural lighting. If you're here on a nice day, it's a really pleasant place to do some work. Street parking isn't too hard to find, and you can find non-metered parking if you park a little farther down from the shop."}
{"text":"Great NON-chain coffee house with fabulous coffee and treats. Get the Orams donuts on the weekend....soooo good. Large space great for networking, meeting friends and just simple quiet time. Friendly attentive staff :) Easy street parking."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check this place out .  I love little coffee shops and this was a pleasant surprise.  Excellent atmosphere with great coffee choices.  My husband ordered a coffee that was half chocolate milk, half coffee. He loved it. I ordered a vanilla cappuccino and also was extremely pleased.  It even had a cute little design on it as well.  One thing I really liked, was that we were asked if it was \"for here\" or \"to go\".  We advised \"for here\" and we actually got served our beverages in mugs/cups.    We will be returning.  They also serve Oram donuts on Saturdays which was also a plus."}
{"text":"I just about did a double take driving past the first time.  Such a clever looking place so close to home and I had no idea.  I am a self admitted coffee snob.  I do not like Starbucks.  Anchor has proper espresso machines and they seem to know how to use them!  I'll be back.  It gets better!  They have Oram's doughnuts!!  Double score!  Now I am going to have to run there to burn off the extra doughnut calories."}
