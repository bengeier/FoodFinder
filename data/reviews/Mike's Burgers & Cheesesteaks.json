{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would.   This place is TERRIBLE!! First off, it was filthy.. Second we waited for our two cheese steaks (meat and cheese) for 30 minutes.. We ordered fries and onion rings as well. Once our food came out the bread was cold like it came out of the fridge, the cheese wasn't even melted and the fries and onion rings I would swear we're made yesterday..  I asked the girl if everything was made to order her response was the meat takes so long to cook because it's kept in the fridge, well I would hope raw meat is kept in the fridge!! I asked what about the fries and onion rings and she said yes we just made them... That is a lie, taste and temp don't lie!   Will never go back!! I can't believe there are so many good reviews for this place, shocking!!!"}
{"text":"Fast service and great burgers!! I ordered from grubhub and then checked reviews.. they were so bad, that if I had looked first I wouldnt have ordered.. but Im glad I did, it was so yummy!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and I'm in love! The atmosphere is cute and retro and the service was so friendly, helpful, and genuine!   Most importantly the food is FANTASTIC!  Would definitely recommend the phili cheesesteak and the veggie burger was delicious!"}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to be there more often.  Great food and great service.  Owner takes great pride in his business and buys quality ingredients.  Why patronize a chain when this is available!"}
{"text":"We happened upon this place on Friday 3/8/2013  We were actually heading to the place next door and i saw the Philly cheesesteak sign and thought why not? Most places who serve them are typically terrible but i always try at least once.!  My husband actually thought it was pricey for a burger at  around 8 dollars but he quickly retracted it when he saw it's size. I ordered the Philly and  my husband  the burger and it was the best Philly in AZ we have had. The steak was so good and i don't eat a lot of red meat. The peppers mushroom onion we perfectly cooked and the bread was so soft and held the large amount of meat and veggies pretty well. The burger was equally delicious and very big! The food was absolutely the freshest! I am a native Californian and there we have lot's of burger places and in moving to Arizona 8 years ago I found there is just not  very many here and it was something i missed. But now i have finally found a place and it is LOCAL and not a chain.  (Besides Joe's farm grill which we enjoy but the lines are just way too long and it is pricey )The owner Mike is very inviting and he makes you feel like you have always known him. He knew it was our first time and he brought us our food and told us a little bit about the restaurant and how he gets his meats & bread and told us everything is freshly prepared  which was totally evident!! He  actually made our lunch which we really loved! We are heading back tonight for dinner this time with our children and i can't wait for another Philly cheesesteak or a Burger and some onion rings and not to forget the wonderful banana split my hubby had. I love the variety of ice cream flavors especially Double chocolate malted crunch ( Thrifty's ice cream flavor )   I never post reviews but had to for Mikes Burgers and Cheesesteaks because it was so wonderful.  Try it you won't regret it."}
{"text":"We just went to Mikes for the first time and we're very impressed.  The food was so yummy and the customer service was amazing.   I haven't had that great of customer service for a long time, well done.  We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing food: they have the best cheesesteaks in town. You have to try the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Excellent homemade burgers. Great portions for the price."}
{"text":"The food was tasty, but rather expensive. I got a bacon cheeseburger and the meat was flavorful, but small....didn't even fill the bun.  I would have given a higher review but the atmosphere/experience wasn't great. We were the only ones there but the tables were dirty. 3 younger guys were working but they didn't care much about their job, they seemed as if they just wanted to hangout in the back. They could have spent some of that time taking care of the place. Windows were dirty, walls looked like they had food on them, vents haven't been dusted in ages(even the within reach vents on the soda fridge) and the 2 month old posters for Frozen on Ice could be removed.  Would I return again? I wouldn't drive any great distance to come here again. With the quality of food that I had, it could be a nice place if someone took a little pride in the place."}
{"text":"Freezer  food is how I would describe the taste of the food here. I took my family in for a meal and spent 10.00 for a cheeses stake that was not fresh. The bun was hard and the meet was over seasoned.  The fries were were bland at best and I could have gotten better fries from Wendy's. I extremely unimpressed  with the taste of everything and would not come back or recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"My first time in and the owner took my order and was extremely nice. I placed a to go order and he gave me a free drink while I waited. I ordered a cheesesteak and fries. The sandwich was awesome and the fires where still crispy even after a 10 minute drive back home. I definitely recommend this place and will going back very soon."}
{"text":"I was pretty excite coming here because of all the great reviews but this must of been a bad day for them. It was a sunday afternoon and only another couple in the place and the food took forever! Also the grilled cheese was a mess. You cant mess up grilled cheese!? Not happy right but will give them another chance again in the future."}
{"text":"Summary: If you want a good old fashioned burger go here!  My wife and I recently moved to Arizona and have been craving a good cheeseburger. You know, the non fast food kind. The kind that tastes like an old fashioned mom-and-pop-joint burger should taste.    We decided to stop at Mike's more or less randomly because my name is also Mike (so naturally we had to try it).  Needless to say, we could not have been more pleased with our little adventure.  As soon as I walked in and saw the juke box and the old-school menu board I knew we had found a winner.  The worker was super nice, took our order, and threw in 2 free drinks because it was our first time!  We each got a burger and a side of fries.  The bun was fresh, toasted, soft, and way above your average mass produced white bread bun. The meat was excellent. You could really taste the freshness in the patty and it was cooked to perfection. Even the fries were tasty!  (I saw the worker bring out a cheesesteak to someone while we were waiting for our food and I will be returning soon).  You can tell Mike's uses really fresh ingredients, including the meat, and knows how to cook a top-notch burger.  Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Food is great, and staff is really friendly. I had the bacon cheeseburger with fries and a drink. The price was reasonable, and on top of that, I also received an additional 10% off for being a business owner. I am definitely going back to try the cheesesteak which looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Place is filthy. Floors had buildup of grease. A real turn off. I get the greasy spoon thing but people still want to see that the place is visually clean. Food was generic and no cheap. No leadership. Kids working tried to be nice but obviously no one is managing. Owner better get control or this will be the eventual end to this place. Won't be back"}
{"text":"My oldest daughter kept wanting to take her dad and sister to Mikes for the cheesesteaks since the two of us had gone earlier in the year. None of us were disappointed. We got a great friendly greeting as soon as you walk in the door from the owner himself. Three of us ordered the cheesesteaks and one order of the kids chicken nuggets. The fries are awesome , I got the onion rings this time, very tasty. Kids even got a scoop of ice cream. Love the 50's music and decor. Hope this place stays around for a long time, cant wait to go back and save room for the new Belgium waffle sundae Mike was telling us about. Sounds Extremely Yummy."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheesesteak combo with onion rings, chilly cheese frys and a vanilla shake with Oreos and gummy worms (which cost a dollar more) for delivery. It got here a little earlier the I expected, which is good, but the guy who delivered took my money and left without giving me my change. He practically sprinted away with 10$ more than I meant to give him. The cheese frys were bland, which I expected. And my shake didn't have any of the toppings that I asked for. It was basically like a McDonald's shake, only costing over 6$ and less thick. I liked the cheesesteak, even though most of the cheese was gathered in one place. The bun was good. I adored the onion rings. My friend had been talking this place up for a while, so I had decided to try it. Overall, I'm disappointed. In the future, if I'm near it, I might get something. Maybe. I'm a more than little miffed about the change and shake. My friend says that the owner is a great guy though and that this usually doesn't happen, so I'll give it a second chance."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Mikes before he had the grill, arguably the best burger in town for taste and size. Bigger is not better, better is better. Their fries are good and you can always top it off with a well stocked ice cream bar. We love this place. Try their cheese steak sandwiches, even east coasters will be surprised."}
{"text":"Went in with my cousin he got a burger I got a cheesesteak and we both spent most of the night in the bathroom...food was not good! They make a much better burger 2doors down from mikes at phonicia...."}
{"text":"This is an awesome restaurant. The burgers were so good and they said they make the ground beef daily. The burgers were better than 5 guys. They also gave us a buy one get one free coupon and the burgers are buy 1 get 1 free every Tuesday. They have hot dogs, burgers and    Fish and chips & icecream. They gave us free sodas too."}
{"text":"First timer. Had the cheesesteak. Was juicy and d-ish. Next time I'll have it with the green chili. Mike was helpful with suggestions. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was here a couple of years ago and it was great so I decided I would treat my son to something special.  Well, the staff was OK but some were just playing around and on their phones.  The floor had not been swept and it was dirt.  won't be back."}
{"text":"Don't eat here!  This place is filthy.  If the kitchen is as dirty as the dining room and bathroom, it should be shut down.  Can't believe an owner would allow his business to look like this.  I should have trusted my instincts and turned around and walked out as soon as I walked in.  Burgers, fries, and cheesesteaks appeared to just be freezer food.  Couldn't finish my food. Hope it doesn't make me sick.  Also way overpriced."}
{"text":"We went in for the first time with our children (11 & 5). We had a cheese steak, hamburgers and chicken nuggets. All the food was excellent very flavorful, The kids ate everything and so did we. The service was just as wonderful as the food. Definitely will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Had a cheese streak with fries and it was amazing.  I loved the look and atmosphere plus the music is great.  Good eats and good times."}
{"text":"Great little place for some of our favorites. Burger, cheesesteak and fish and chips were all fantastic. The owner was there and is super friendly. They have a great ice cream selection to follow up your meal. My daughter loved it! If you're looking for some classic mom and pop food, this is the place."}
{"text":"Best danger cheese Burger I've ever had!"}
{"text":"We walked in for dinner on Sunday at 7:50 the young kid working the counter made it clear that we were not welcome because they closed in 10 min. Needless to say we will not be back EVER. We used to come on a regular basis. Management you can thank him for your loss of business"}
{"text":"Outside of Philly, a good cheesesteak is hard to come by. I had my reservations before I went in, but being a fair guy, I figured I'd at least give it a shot at Mike's. I ordered the steak with cherry peppers, fries, and a drink. I was pleased that Mike had Gold Peak Iced Tea with that cool 4-button feature for different flavors. When the food arrived, I took a look at it and said, \"It looks like a cheesesteak. It smells like a cheesesteak. By God, this just might be an actual cheesesteak!\" It was love at first bite, and needless to say my wife and I have become semi-regulars at this great little restaurant. Mike always takes care of us, I shake his hand and thank him when I leave, and you can tell he genuinely loves his customers. Go. Now."}
{"text":"Great place to go. Ice cream is awesome and so is the food."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak in town!  I have tried Gxxxxs and they don't come close to Mikes."}
{"text":"Great cheesesteak. My oldest son, who's never tried one, said, \"this is the BEST!\". My other son said, \"these sliders are like GOLD on a plate\" and my wife liked her bacon cheeseburger. Good, friendly service too. Mike's a nice guy and makes some good food."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed! My bf and I needed to grab something quick to eat.. They said it wouldn't be long at all so we ordered a philly steak and fries. We heard them taking in the back about how they ran out of philly steak and need to microwave more. There were multiple staff members eating in the back while working. They had friends or people who were off the clock coming and going in the kitchen area. Food took 25+ minutes and the fries were very cold! Staff was very immature and weren't mindful of customers in the store. It didn't seem like they were under any kind of management. By far one of the worst experiences!"}
{"text":"Always on the hunt for a good  burger , this time was Mike's  place  . Hamburger was decent size nothing crazy good flavor and service attentive . will come back !!!"}
{"text":"It's good when the owner is working; quite the opposite when he is not. Kids working, forgetting orders, other LOUD kids hanging out, and dirty.  Too bad because the food is/ can be really good!"}
{"text":"I was looking for somewhere new to go for lunch and decided to try this place after driving by it many, many times.  I ordered the cheesesteak and some onion rings and OMG the cheesesteak was so very good!  While the guy at the front counter wasn't the friendliest (I came to eat, not make friends so who really cares?) my food was better than expected.  So much so that I was compelled to call after eating my lunch and offer my compliments!    The bread on my sandwich was SUPER soft and fresh and they do not skimp on the meat!  The onion rings were HUGE and yummy.  I couldn't eat the entire sandwich and rings in one sitting, so I had left overs for lunch the next day and the bread on the sandwich did not get soggy when heated up.  Although I was disappointed that they do not have GRILLED chicken for their chicken sandwiches, the cheesesteaks will keep me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food and the service.  I would definitely come back here for the cheesesteak (with beef, American cheese, onion, and mushrooms)."}
{"text":"Will be back very soon!!! Cheese steak with green chilies, jalapeno, onions, mushrooms!  His home made chips where awesome! And the owner was very kind!"}
{"text":"Wow  the food is fantastic,  my wife adn I had the cheesesteak   it melted in your mouth  the bread was perfect  toasted on the inside just enough for the crunch but soft on the outside.  The owner offered to help us order since my wife was on crutchs so we didnt have to stand at the counter.  Our kids joined us about 5 minutes after we ordered and they made sure all our food came out together and it was perfect. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal."}
{"text":"I had a burger and onion rings.  The food tasted good. The staff was friendly and service was prompt.  I gave them three stars because the price seemed a little too much and the restaurant was dirty.  I imagine if the sitting area of the restaurant is that dirty the kitchen must also be dirty."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last year and must say I am always satisfied.  Staff is always friendly and polite.  The cheesesteak is the best in town.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"1st Visit to Mikes with a party of 10 & Mike,  Luke and crew DELIVERED!! Chili dog, Cheesesteak & Thrifty Ice Cream knocked it out of the park!!"}
{"text":"Great little pit stop on Gilbert rd.  Tried the 1/3 lb. burger, onion rings, fries, and choc. milkshake. All were exceptionally great, although I think the rings were better than the fries. The one thing I liked about the burger is that it's not too greasy.  Unfortunately I didn't get to try any of the ice cream, but wouldn't doubt its wonderful flavor.   Whenever you're near this area, why not make it Mike's?"}
{"text":"The Family and I love going here for dinner.  My favorite is the cheese steaks!  I am a fan of the cheese steak and it is hard to find a good one.  Mike has found the secret combination.  I would recommend you try it out if you enjoy a great cheese steak,  My son loves the kids sliders!  Great family owned business!"}
{"text":"$12 for a cheesesteak is insane. I had a cup of water to accompany my meal. It wasn't a bad sandwich but definitely not worth that price. If I had gotten fries and a drink (which I wanted) it would have been upwards of $20 bucks. C'mon Mike.."}
{"text":"I'm fairly particular about cheesesteaks being from the east coast as I have had opportunities to get some from Philadelphia in the past. These are not Philadelphia cheesesteaks. But they made me think of Philadelphia cheesesteaks, and I don't think I could give a higher recommendation for anything you could get here in Arizona. My friend had the jalapeño burger and it was deliciously hot. We both had fries and they were also good. Now I'm going back in for the ice cream. It's totally worth the trip. Food was very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Te best cheese steak west of Philly!  Excellent fries and potato chips, too. UPDATE:  The cheese steak is even better with the new rolls.  I tried a chicken cheese steak this week.  It might even be better than the regular cheese steak."}
{"text":"My fiance and I had just gotten back from Cancun and were in the mood for a burger so after looking through some reviews we happened on this place. Burgers were good, chips were crispy and the fries were alright. Next time I will try the cheesesteak."}
{"text":"The cheesesteak and burgers are amazing here! Food came out fast and fresh as promised. Delicious! Staff is very friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Mike's in Gilbert is without a doubt the best cheese steak in AZ. Homemade fries, chips,  onion rings,  and now sweet potaoes fries are amazing!  Great  Sevice and atmosphere.  When ur done with ur meal u can enjoy ur favorite ice cream, chocolate malted crunch, oh ya.  Mike's is now my goto place."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite restaurants! Every thing on their menu is absolutely amazing and you can tell none of it is ever frozen. Their onion rings and wings are to die for. Without a doubt, some of the best onion rings I've ever had. Also, their green chilies are super fresh and delicious. I have no complaints about this restaurant. Not to mention all the staff is amazing, they truly care about the quality of the food and your experience there!"}
{"text":"Mike is a great guy with a great business! Burgers are good save room for dessert though. Great food at great prices. Thanks Mike!"}
{"text":"Great little place, a retro diner feel.  The burgers are very good, and the cheesesteaks are awesome!  Get a cheesesteak with cheesewiz... Sounds weird, but that's how it's done in Philly, and it's soooooooooooo good!  The ice cream is wonderful, too!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night 4 people.  Good food.  The place was kinda dirty.  Tables, floors needed cleaned. Would eat their again."}
{"text":"Very friendly. Cheesesteak was large and very tasty. Excellent onion rings. Been there a few times and each time the food and service is always excellent. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I see a lot of reviews saying this place is pricey. They are not wrong but the quality makes up for it. Its about the same price as Red Robin but significantly better. You may not have as many gimmicky options but the quality of the cheese-steaks and burgers is really high. When My wife and I  want a good cheesesteak or burger we drive all the way out here from signalbutte and elliot (~13 miles)."}
{"text":"Took over two hours to get a sandwich delivered and to say that the staff was apathetic to the problem would be generous, not spending money here again. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"First of all, I should have known when we walked in at lunch time and there was nobody there that we needed to leave.  Well we stayed and it was a mistake. First, no one there seemed interested to take our order. We called out several times. There was one guy in plain site just sitting in the back room with his feet up doing nothing. I called out again and finally some girl who seemed uninterested came out.  Menu look a little pricy but we gave it a chance. Another mistake. Sister ordered a regular burger, $6.95.  Well when they brought it to the table it looked like a small McDonalds burger with 1 slice of tomato, 1 small piece of lettuce, and a couple of pickle slices. That's it. No chips, no fries, nothing. You can get the biggest burger @ Sonic, Whata-burger, Burger King, etc cheaper and better. Not good. I ordered a Philly-cheese steak that was $10.95 only to find out that they also charged me .75 extra on top for the Cheez-Whiz. REALLY?  That's $11.70 for just an ok sandwich on dried out bread and very little Cheez-Whiz. We ordered 2 sodas not knowing (and not told) that they were out of everthing except Dr. Pepper and Diet Coke. Again,(REALLY?). We spent nearly $25.00 for what we could go somewhere else for about half and had better food. I don't know how they stay in business. Extremely over priced and not very good. My advice is to stay away..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a cheese steak sandwich. Not only was the sandwich excellent, home made fries and a fountain Sosa was included. Very clean too."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic. The food is amazing, and the customer service is just as great. Good music, very nice dining room. And they have ice cream! It really doesn't get better than this because the crew at Mike's Burgers and Cheesesteaks knows what they're doing. I got the Cheesesteak with mushrooms and jalapeños, I highly recommend it. Also, burgers are Buy One Get One free on Tuesday. Come check this place out."}
{"text":"Excellent! My son and i go every Tuesday for buy 1 get one half off! We try to never miss. I get to enjoy a perfect burger everytime"}
{"text":"This place is no Philly's Famous. But since I had a HUGE craving for cheesesteaks, and Philly's is closed on Sunday, I had to go somewhere else.  We had a coupon for one free menu item when you buy one... So we ordered two cheesesteaks, and an order of fries. We called our order in, since a lot of the reviews said that the wait time was horrible. we live at warner and mcqueen, and right after we called the order in, we left to go get it (5-6 minute drive). When I went in, I was greeted right away, and said that they would be right with me. The employee took care of me quickly and told me it would just be a minute for my food to be finished. Once we got our food we were on our way home. Upon opening the to go containers, we were both shocked to see how huge the cheesesteaks were!!  I got a basic cheesesteak with onion and peppers, and my husband got the same but with jalapeños added. The peppers were too sweet for my liking. I feel like cheesesteaks are supposed to be savory. My husband complete disagreed though. He loved the hot and sweet combo.  My main issue with everything were the fries.... On the website, the fries look crispy and delicious.... these were fries that were clearly in the freezer for a really long time and they were gritty.  In the other reviews, someone mentioned the cleanliness of the actual restaurant, and I must agree. Their restaurant needs a really good cleaning. The floors had footprints all over them, and behind the counter didn't look that clean either....  If I had to get a cheesesteak on a Sunday again, I'd try them one more time without peppers, and if it still wasn't that great, I'd wait until Monday to get Philly's famous deliciousness!!!"}
{"text":"Filthy floors and tables, ripped up booths, patched with ducted tape.  Just gross!  Doors had grime build up.  Did not let my family eat there, was afraid we might get sick."}
{"text":"My brother's family and I had out of town guests. Had my mom, my nephew and his wife in town and tickets to Hale theatre, wanted something we hadn't tried before. 2 hours til showtime, perfect timing and able to beat the crowd. Not! First to arrive,  long line after us and took well over an hour to get our food. Cheese steak was amazing but not worth that wait. I've seen food leave Hell's Kitchen faster. Kept saying \"5 minutes\", c'mon. Brought my brother's families food, we watched them eat. Then brought my nephew and his wife's food, we watched them eat. Then brought me and my Mom's food, had to scarf it to make the curtain call. Too bad, doubt we'll give them another shot. Go next door, saw lots of people walking by with their pizza boxes. Those customer's looked happy."}
{"text":"Stopped in today and ordered a beef philly with onions, peppers, jalapeños and cheese. I really like the sandwich. The bread was soft and easy to eat. The beef was tender and tasty. I will be back. Oh they also serve Thrifty brand ice cream which is very good."}
{"text":"As far as I'm concerned, a Philly cheese steak should not cost over 10 dollars and it should actually taste good. I didn't like the way the meat tasted and even the cheese had a kick to it.  Not for me."}
{"text":"Another fine family owned awesome food spot.  There is just something about the owner of a restaurant present .  I showed up with my little ones five minutes after they opened on a monday.  Service is perfect.  The food is even better.  This is a must if you want a burger, fries, cheese steak or a hot dog.  The food came out and it was visually awesome.  No mess here !!  The employees take pride in their jobs and it shows."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and had a burger. The burgers are always very good and the thin fries are good also. I saw someone else getting a cheese steak that made me want to try one sometime in the future. They have ice cream here also but I didn't try any since I was already pushing my diet for the day. I really like this place and will definitely be back when I'm in this part of Gilbert!"}
{"text":"We passed by this place a few times and finally decided to give it a try.  We are so glad we did.  We ordered bacon cheeseburgers and they were out of this world!  I am so sorry we didn't go here sooner.  I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"My kids and I like it here. We come often on Sunday's when it is typically not too busy. Their burgers are fresh meat made to order. So delicious! They added a new item to their menu, garlic fries! So good! They also sale ice-cream and offer a variety of traditional and creative flavors! The atmosphere is a throw back to the 50's and the customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"Good product but took over 30min to get a burger on a sat that was not that busy.  Its as if they have no idea that they are about to sell another burger at 6:30pm."}
{"text":"Saw this place driving by and the reviews were great so we thought we'd give it a try. Very good decision. It was delicious. We went in for take out and I ordered the cheeseburger sliders with onion rings. I wish I would have ordered something more exciting because the sliders were just basic meat and cheese on buns( probably better for kids). But still pretty dang good. The onion rings were fantastic! My husband got a cheesesteak sandwich with cheese whiz and it was amazing. I had a bite and I felt like I wanted to steal his. Great tasting, fresh and hot. Definitely will be going back. A lot. Can't wait to try the ice cream!"}
{"text":"Being from Philly I have been on the hunt for a great chicken cheesesteak. This place delivers. The chicken was exactly what you would expect if you ordered back east. I had delivery and they were fast, courteous and got my special order correct.  I highly recommend. I love the chicken cheesesteak with mushrooms!!"}
{"text":"Fat kid food heaven!  Best Philly Cheesesteak I have ever had.  Roll was incredibly soft.  Ice cream shakes are amazing.  Huge selection of ice cream.  Onion rings are amazing.  Only thing bad I can say is the restroom was mediocre clean at best."}
{"text":"Blue cheese burger was good, standard fare.  Fries were good.  I asked for the combo .  $10.  Pretty standard pricing.    I wished the tables were cleaner.  I had to do that myself.  Teenager employees were super nice and friendly.  Liked that!  Great place to stop on my way to the movies.    Would stop again."}
{"text":"Awfully rude employees and mediocre food.  I watched as the employee didn't wash his hands when handling my food and when I asked if he could he made a disgusted face at me and was very short and snotty speaking to me from there on out.  I wouldn't recommend it, id go elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Ordered delivery since the kids were in bed. Food arrived after over an hour of waiting (we live a mile away) and was cold. Burgers are small! It looks like they use frozen patties. The lettuce for the salad was brown so I just threw it out. I definitely expected a burger patty made at the restaurant for the price. We could have gone to Burger King to get the same quality, larger portions, and pay half the price. Never again."}
{"text":"I went to mikes for the first and last time today. Firstly 32.xx for a cheesesteak and onion rings and a drink is cray. I went to Texas Roadhouse the night before and got a meal for me and my partner we paid 35 dollars (including tip) and got 4 or 5 times the fresh meat and food mikes wanted to serve.   I explained to Mike that I didn't want to pay that much and he SET IT OFF on me talking about how he barely makes his rent, and how he brings in the meat fresh, and he had the audacity to say that since I don't own a food joint I can't say anything about prices. Of course I told him that the conversation was inappropriate to have with a Customer but he carried on and than in the end gave me a discount.   Good food but not worth the price or the additive the owner had."}
{"text":"This review is a bit overdue as we went there a few weeks ago.  Bring your appetite and desire for friendly banter with Mike. Small place but how they got voted 2nd or 3rd best burgers in Gilbert is beyond me.I thought they rivaled Ted's Montana Grill (not in Az).  And get the onion rings!"}
{"text":"Food was terrific! The bun my cheese steak was on was very fresh. Waited about 15 min before our food came out, which was a little frustrating but like I said, food was terrific. Will be back."}
{"text":"As advertised meat was high quality. They cooked the burger to the way I ordered. Service was very good   Even my wife liked everything which is rare. Will go back."}
{"text":"Good work of sitting in the back on your phones, i went in to get a drink and ice cream, and the two teens on shift were too busy trying their hardest to avoid working to get me food, they refused to come take my order even as i stood there looking at them, instead i had to go next door to get food instead, mike u might want to have your employees actually work"}
{"text":"NOT BAD , But not as good as fuddruckers...I was pleased to not have to drive 10 miles to fuddruckers"}
{"text":"My husband got take out due to me on being on bedrest... I ordered just a normal cheeseburger with grilled onions - amazing and juicy. Husband got a cheesesteak and it was HUGE. After slamming down the food we both agree this is definitely a place to keep coming back to! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just not that good. Young staff trying hard, but no leadership.  Burger was dry over cooked. I am unlikely to go back."}
{"text":"Best Burgers!!.. The bacon is thick, the burgers are huge & taste great. Every time we have been there everyone has been friendly & helpful. Love this place"}
{"text":"Their hamburgers are hand formed with quality meats and the cheesesteaks are the best I've had on the West Coast. The service was awesome and everyone was extremely friendly. This is a great local business. Support them!"}
{"text":"First off I have to say the employee Ty R is a real model employee. We were very well taken care of and definitely will keep coming back. The past two times I have stopped in for lunch the owner had been working and he is very kind as well! The food is absolutely delicious as always and we are never disappointed with it. Keep it local"}
{"text":"Wife and I each ordered their cheesesteak  sandwich. Onions, peppers and mushrooms all chopped with thinly sliced prime rib, and served with white American cheese on a freshly baked roll. Fantastic. Great flavor. Easy to eat. Not sloppy, which some cheesesteaks sandwiches can be. Had an order of fries, which were just ok. Sat on the patio, which was nice. We'll go back again, without a doubt."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for the first time tonight and we were very impressed.  Amazing cheesesteaks, burgers, and onion rings!!!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yay!!! Finally closed! Surprised it lasted that long. Thanks for the three times of awful food MIKE. ."}
{"text":"Quality of cheese steaks is good and the ingredients for both the steaks and salads are equally good, for me.  I only have one problem which is why it is given only 3 stars and that has to do with the cleanliness of the restaurant and my observations of some techniques used in the kitchen and that can be observed while sitting inside the restaurant.  The windows have probably not been cleaned for a while now as there were dead \"gnat like\"  insects lining the ledges and near the two tables which are arranged alongside these ledges that I have observed between a visit several days ago (Mar 12, 2013) and my current visit on March 14, 2013).  Since doors are open many times during this time of year, specifically, it may prove to be a non-issue, as the days increasingly become warmer.  I did observed the staff handling the lettuce, onions and other ingredients by hand. (Note:  Even if a staff member, cook or the preparation staff uses the restroom and washes their hands, for example, touching any community surface(s) or  the door handle to that restroom, and after washing your hands, ultimately cancels out the hand washing benefits.  Touching doors and surfaces and then preparing things like salads, or touching rolls used for sandwiches is obviously an oversight but still poor habits for an food preparing establishment.  I usually rely on the fact that the meat inside is cooked sufficiently with the onions that there will be no apparent issues upon devouring it as a sub!  To date, I hesitate to go back but I have done so due to the cooking effect (heat) and quality of the hot subs offered.  I hope the owner or manager reads these comments because I would have loved to have given 4 stars on this restaurant; however, hygiene is as important as the product taste at the end of the day.  Food illness is very serious and no one wants to play Russian Roulette with a meal's contents and rely on any external effect to correct the deficiency that can be eliminated upfront and in the first place. Barring the issues described and/or observed above, a 3/5 star rating seems to match well with my experiences here."}
{"text":"OMGOMGOMG. So, I walk in and there are oldies playing on a jukebox! Perfecto.  I couldn't decide on the cheesesteak or a burger, so flip of a coin in my head and burger it was. I ordered the half pound with grilled onions and cheese. The burger was INSANE!!! I took a bite of the burger to decide whether or not I wanted to add the veggies. Get away rabbit food!!! The burger was so juicy and the flavor, THE FLAVORRR!!!!!!! This may make sense to some  of you, the burger tasted like beef! Like a great steakhouse steak, dry-aged type shit!! The fries were fresh and on point.  The guy who took my order (mike maybe?) promised a good burger, and delivered.  He promised a good cheesesteak, and I believe him. Will def return.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"GREAT food and desserts. The management is very friendly and greet you at the door. Very clean, sanitary establishment and will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Definitely a Hit!!!! Tasty, delicious, fresh, quality food anyone would love!!! With wonderful service to top it off!!!"}
{"text":"I am such a fan of Mike's!  We have been here at least a dozen times over the past 6 months and love it more each and every time we come. My kids even love it and they have a great variety of kids meals!  The Cheesesteaks are unbelievable (burgers are great too, but the wife and I always get the cheesesteaks) and 100% never frozen, fresh meat that is brought in each and every day!  You can't ask for anything better than that. Mike is an amazing business owner that seems to talk to every table throughout your visit...and it's good conversation too!    Congrats to Mike on running a great business with an even better product!  I'm looking forward to my next visit already!!"}
{"text":"I placed an order through door dash and the food got to my door within 45 minutes which was faster than expected, but that is where the good stops unfortunately. I ordered a cheeseburger, a steak and cheese, chili cheese fries, sweet potato fries, 2 cokes, and finished nothing but the 1 coke I actually got. Besides them forgetting my other coke, The sweet potato fries where burnt, the steak and cheese was dry and tasted like it was made with old meat and also did not contain the onions and mushrooms that where supposed to be on it. The cheeseburgers, yes I got 2 for some reason, had shitty meat and also tasted like they where left out overnight. I also took 2 bites of the chili cheese fries then threw them away. I will never get food here again and hope you find this review useful."}
{"text":"First time at Mikes, I ordered a beef cheesesteak sandwich & a drink, since it was my first time, my soda was free!! My sandwich was worth every penny!! I have that feeling of being full, but can't stop eating cause my sandwich is so good!! Keep up the amazing food! I will be back to try new things and have some ice cream too!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic! They have a big selection, and big portions! They food smells and tastes delicious. And I was pleasantly surprised when it showed up 10 minutes before the estimated time. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place a few times, but this last time sealed the deal on me never ordering again.  Previously, I ordered a cheeseburger with grilled onions.  I received a cheeseburger with grilled onions.  No lettuce... tomato... onions... not even ketchup and mustard.  Not even PACKETS of ketchup and mustard.  Who sends over a cheeseburger without these things?  But the burger wasn't bad in and of itself so I didn't rule the place out, I just figured I'd make sure to request toppings next time.  Although, I still felt it was ridiculous that I had to special  order such things.  I've had their fish and chips and it's two sad, tiny pieces of fish with fries.  Not worth the price.  It didn't taste *bad*, but they didn't taste any better than if I'd just popped some Gorton's in the toaster oven.  This last time, my roommate and I ordered food.  Two cheeseburgers, fries, and 2 orders of onion rings, as well as a raspberry iced tea for him, and what I thought was a 2-liter of Coke for me.  For $2.50 I expect a full 2-liter. And since Eat24 doesn't list the size of beverage, there was no way I could have known it wasn't a 2-liter.  You might say, \"Well, you should have asked first.\"  But no, I disagree.  Every single place that delivers to my house, that has 2-liters of soda, charges from $2.00 - $3.00.  I can get a FULL 2-liter from another restaurant for less than the cost of a medium sized drink at this place.  This was unacceptable to me.  I'd have sucked it up had the size been listed, but since it wasn't... I do not accept this.  Additionally, they forgot one of my orders of onion rings.  So, I called the restaurant to let them know that my onion rings were missing and to let them know I was upset about the misleading information and pricing regarding their soda.  I was immediately sent to Mike's voicemail.  Literally, the actual man... Mike.  His voicemail.  After the first ring.  I called again thinking it must have been a fluke that I would get his voicemail on the first ring like that since the restaurant was still open, and I got it again.  I tried twice more and the same thing.  The voicemail message stated that he was probably busy making burgers and to leave a message and he'd return the call within 24 hours.  What?  24 hours?  You screwed up my order and I have to wait up to 24 hours to get a replacement?  That was just too much for me.    This isn't a business... this is some guy cooking burgers and overpricing.  For what he charges for his food, you'd think he'd have enough money to get a multi-line business phone system and another employee to answer them.   I had to contact Eat24 instead of dealing directly with the restaurant, and fortunately they refunded me for the onion rings and the soda, but I'm pretty sure that was their doing and not Mike's.  They told me that he was contacted regarding the issue, but I haven't heard anything from Mike.  Good customer service would dictate that he call me with an apology, refund me, and offer some incentive to order from them again.    We order a lot of food.  I mean a lot.  We don't like to cook but we really like to eat, so I'm talking like... $200 a week in take out between the two of us.  Mike has made sure that we never divvy up that money over to his restaurant again.  So why the two star rating and not one?  I'm a fair person.  I'm not going to give them one star solely because they're running a circus over there.  The burgers are actually quite tasty (when you remember to ask them specially for the normal toppings that burgers should come with).  Nothing AMAZING... nothing to go out of your way for to try.  But good enough and a good size.  Although, still incredibly overpriced, just like everything else on his menu."}
{"text":"Great service and Mike is personable. Got the first-timer 10% discount and 2 free drinks."}
{"text":"I went here based on other yelp reviews and honestly was not that impressed. The burger was kind of bland but on the plus side, it was fresh and made to order."}
{"text":"Family and I stopped in while we were in Gilbert due to its excellent yelp reviews. This place is located in a shopping complex - off in the corner.  Our first impression was less than positive - the place was super small and it was pretty dirty. Floors were sticky, windows had smears on them and tables were unclean. We decided to proceed with ordering (I'm not sure why?!) and I'm glad we did. We each got a cheesesteak sandwich and they were pretty tasty. The meat was well seasoned, it was chopped up perfectly (no huge pieces) and it was tender. I agree that a different bread might enhance it but it was tasty nonetheless. The staff was friendly and helpful. We ended up getting it to go (thanks to our tired and unruly children ) and they packaged everything up well and sent plenty of napkins, plasticware and condiments. We be back when we are in the area - it's hard to find tasty cheesesteaks!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been in a long time and I regret that...  Got my wife the beef cheesesteak with all the fixings and it was awesome.  Fully loaded, fresh bread and a ton of delicious fries..  I got the half pound bacon cheese burger and sweet potato fries.  Also delicious.  Mike the owner is super nice and literally asks each guest as they walk out how their meal was.  And also thanks them for coming in.  Great Place, great food.  Go there!"}
{"text":"Thought I would try again last week only because I was close. Didn't even order. The place, again, was filthy. Very surprised the health department has not clamped down on them. Cant imagine what the kitchen looks like"}
{"text":"This is a really small place, but we really liked it. Great service, yummy cheesesteaks, super casual 50s atmosphere. Looking forward to coming back sometime."}
{"text":"My wife says lets try something new. Guess these guys have been here for a little while. The Republic suggested them so off we went. Great little corner Ice Cream parlor burger joint. The Cheese steak is to die for! My wife loved her burger as well everything was fixed as you ordered it! Hot and fresh! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Owner was very friendly and helpful. Other employees were pleasant but not as attentive as the owner. Meat is heavily spiced which isn't our preference but quality  of the food was good. Would be willing to try it again with a request not to season the meat."}
{"text":"Took them over an hour to get our food. Why well because they lost our order then proceeded to bring one item out at a time so my family could not eat together. Just overall terrible staff. I get teenagers need a first job but someone needs to train them. They offered up a $25 gift card for our trouble. So I decided to give it another try only for basically the same thing happen again. This place is a mess and the food for an In and out style burger joint is well lets say sub par. I mean it is a small burger joint so not expecting anything spectacular but man this is just worth ever coming back on multiple levels."}
{"text":"I hate to leave negative reviews, but I also hate glowing reviews that are inaccurate and deceptive.  Been here twice using Groupon discounts. First time tried a Cheesesteak w/ onion rings which was tasty for the first half and then it started tasting heavy, greasy, and kind of blah. Second time, ordered a cheeseburger. It was just so-so...maybe a step above McD's (maybe). The place is staffed and run by teeny-boppers who are cute and friendly, but obviously this is their first job, which is good for them. We didn't see any adults either time and it was apparent that experienced adult supervisors are MIA. It appears that the owners/managers are NOT hands-on in their business and are minimalist. Ketchup & Mustard bottles and salt & pepper containers on all tables and a shelf above a trash bin were all nasty, greasy and appeared to not have been cleaned in a really long time - very germmy. Had to wash my hands after squeezing out some ketchup & mustard on my burger before I could even think about picking it up to eat it. Most of the ice cream in the case looked crusty and crystallized - not really to fresh appearing - almost freezer burned. We won't return, even though I love to support small shops like this."}
{"text":"One of the best cheesesteaks I've had since moving from Philly. And unlike other cheesesteaks I've had out here, this place doesn't skimp on the meat. Only criticism is the bread. Should be chewier and maybe slightly toasted."}
{"text":"We tried Mikes after purchasing a groupon and glad to find a great burger place close to home.  The restaurant is in a nice location across from Gilbert Town Center and is nicely decorated with a old diner feel but being a new building is clean and creates a fun atmosphere.  We met the owner and he seems genuinely interested in cooking for you and you enjoying his food.   I had a great cheeseburger which had optional specialty sauces or toppings available and my husband loved the cheesesteak before topping of his stay with icecream.  The fries were average but others have said the other sides are great.  The prices are higher then average but we will return to MIke's  to support this small business for the friendly staff, quality of the food and ingredients and fun décor that you wont find at a franchise joint."}
{"text":"I don't normally hit the same spot twice in one week but I kept thinking about the flavor of the meat and how great the bread was, so I wanted to give this place another shot.   Glad I did! I got the cheese whiz this time and this was one of the best cheesesteaks I've had. Just needed a bit more cheese and bit more seasoning on the steak.  The customer service was awesome again! My new go to for a cheese steak quick fix."}
{"text":"You'd never know it from looking at the place, but these guys put together a very good Philly cheesesteak. Warm quality bread, and a ton of beef, with tasty peppers, onions, and cheese - in the top 3 or 4 cheesesteak sandwiches that I've had. Onion rings were pretty good as well.  It looks like it's just a fun little corner ice cream shop that happens to serve food as well, but they definitely know how to make a cheesesteak. Burgers are supposed to be good as well - I don't get to this side of town that often, but if I make it back, I'll have to give that a try."}
{"text":"Was not impressed. The food tasted fair, but the restaurant was dirty. Crusty mustard and ketchup bottles. Huge holes in the booth. Even my daughters burger basket had some type of other \"sauce\" on it that didn't come from one of our baskets. We will never return.!"}
{"text":"Man.....what a nice guy, Mike. The food was delicious. The best ingredients. Anyway, as soon as me and my family walked in, we were priority,which is becoming rare. Enjoyed and will be back."}
{"text":"Food is tasty, a bit pricy, but oh well. Server  had an attitude when I was trying to verify my order. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Friendly place!  Amazing burgers!   Onion rings were delicious!   Coming back soon!   Definitely try this place"}
{"text":"Went in the other day to a warm greeting from the manager and what was apparently his son! You always know a restaurant is going to be good and clean when it's a family owned one. I ordered the Philly cheesesteak (YUM!) with onions and peppers while my wife purchased the green chili pepperjack. I never meant this more than I do now: you get what you pay for! Anyways I would recommend a philly and one of their \"specialty burgers\" if you're a first timer, they'll sure bring you back. I know I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Great place for cheesesteaks and extras!! Food was delicious and the owner is a great guy! Definitely stop here and grub!! Can't wait until my next visit!! Sorry no pictures, was too good to wait!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Everyone is so nice and the service is great. The food is definitely all American! Salsa burger is to die for! Mike is such a great guy and whenever my family and I come in we are greeted with with opens arms!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Mike's twice.  Tried the burger the first visit.  The burger was very good and why I gave 3 stars.  Went back to try the Philly Steak sandwich.  Just an FYI: I was born and raised in Philly and know what goes into a good Philly steak sandwich and what it should taste like.  The steak at Mike's was just fair.  Tasted a bit like roast beef.  Probably because they use prime rib for the meat.  That is not the cut of meat that is used in a Philly steak sandwich.   The meat should be either rib eye or skirt steak, shaved thin.   Besides the meat the second most important part of the sandwich is the bread.  The rolls they use for the steak are too soft and mushy.  At first I thought it was just a large hot dog bun.  It should be on a good Italian roll or baguette, crusty on the outside and soft inside.   I ordered my steak with white American cheese.  The cheese did not have much of a taste and wasn't creamy like a good brand of cheese (Land of Lakes, Clearfield) would have been.  The one thing they did right was chop the meat up on the grill.  I have yet to find a Philly steak sandwich in Arizona, that can stand up to a real Philly steak sandwich, ever since Max's Taste of Philly in Mesa closed up."}
{"text":"We went in for burgers an hour before they closed and were told they were out of burgers. May want to change the name of your place. Ordered cheesesteaks and basket of onion rings. Order chicken nugget kids meal. We were the only people there and it took 25 minutes to get our food. Onion rings were $4 and we got 5 onion rigs in the basket! The chicken nuggets were hot but the cheesesteaks were cold and the cheese wasn't even melted. I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"Took twice as long as expected, burger didn't have mustard or ketchup, salad was JUST ICEBERG LETTUCE AND CHICKEN! I ordered the cheesesteak salad and it was $8. Incredibly disappointed. Total rip off!"}
{"text":"Great food prepared by someone who loves food and loves serving people good food.  Cheesesteak was solid! Kids loved the sliders.  Thrifty ice cream to finish it off.  Great service."}
{"text":"I've never tried cheese steaks in Philadelphia, so I cannot comment on how \"authentic\" these are, however they tasted good to me.  The bread was very fresh, and did not get too soggy.  The onion rings were very good as well.  I didn't get a chance to try the ice cream, but will have to next time.  The person cooking (the owner I think?) was very friendly.  We will be back."}
{"text":"One of those places that teeters on good and great, but can't get over the hump due to presumably poor management.  Appearance is important when you walk into a food joint and while Mike's does have some cool stuff like the jukebox, checkered floors, catchy logo and vintage seating, they miss the mark overall.    For example, the jukebox has a stupid old sign on it that says 'don't touch'.  Come on guys, spend $5 to get a professional looking sign.  The ordering area overlooks this awkwardly large space that is sort of an unnecessary space hog in an already small restaurant.  While it is filled with some ice cream and an outdated register, from my two visits, it is mostly full of young awkward employees sort of standing around trying to find something to do.  Don't get me wrong, most of the employees really offer great customer service, but there are a couple of nincompoops in the bunch as well.  The food is good, but could be great because they use a lot of fresh, quality ingredients.  The problem is probably more around consistency because my second visit was about 10x better than the first.  They use quality beef from Midwestern Meats and all of the veggies tasted fresh as well.  The kids enjoyed the chicken nuggets as well.  Wasn't a fan of the french fries, very mediocre, nothing special.  The onion rings were a let down.  I don't know what it was, my guess is the crunch mix they use is lacking seasoning or originality.    I'll go back again for the fresh meat and the sliders, but hopefully management can get this little joint over the hump."}
{"text":"Sunday lunch with a buddy.  I ordered the build-your-own cheesesteak and onion rings on the side.  Buddy ordered the 1/2 burger with bacon, 'shrooms and fries.  Guy behind the counter was friendly and tossed in free drinks given our first visit there. (thanks!)  About 20 minutes for the food but we were told beforehand which was nice.  Worth the wait though.  Cheesesteak had good flavor and was served hot -- the aroma was worth the visit itself upon serving.  Onion rings were good but I'd order cheese fries next time.  My buddy devoured his burger and fries without saying much as he was focused eating and that is a good thing!  Good eats were had and I'll be back upcoming.  Recommended."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times. Each time was wonderful. The first time I ate here, I had the Philly Cheesesteak, home made potato chips and unsweetened iced tea. I have never had a cheesesteak sandwich in Phiiy, so I can't tell you if this is \"authentic\", but I can tell you that it is delicious and huge. Although I did attempt to pick it up to eat it, the softness of the roll (my only complaint about the Philly) forced me to eat it with knife & fork. My second visit to Mike's, I got the 1/3 pound green chili burger, sweet potato fries and iced tea. The burger was one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. The burger is cooked perfectly, and the green chilis give it a little bite. This isn't \"fast food\", this is home made, cooked after you order it, and fixed exactly how you want it. I have yet to have room for ice cream, but I grew up with Thrifty Drug Stores, so I know the ice cream will please any ice cream lover."}
{"text":"Food is amazing but the owner -Mike- makes this place twice as amazing!! Can be ordered and delivered which is AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Good, friendly service from employees who seem genuinely interested in making sure everything is great! The cheesesteak was as good as you'd find at some popular places in Philadelphia."}
{"text":"Joni and I were in Gilbert to scope out the real estate in the area. We decided to go around and check out some of the eating establishments. We were not hungry at the time and just wanted to see the menus to see what was available. Stopped by Mikes Burgers and were greeted by Mike the owner. We chatted a bit and after a little conversation decided that it would be a good place for some good ole American food.   A couple of days later we stopped in for some cheese steak sandwiches and were amazed at how good they were. The rolls were great and the steak was piled up to the ceiling. We are moving from Colorado to Gilbert and are very pleased that we have a place to go for our cheese steak fix. I have not tried the burgers yet but I will bet they are great too."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch the other day because its right by my work and our school is doing an ice cream fundraiser here. So we thought we give this place a try. The owner was very friendly and helped recommend some things to eat. I ordered their Philly cheese steak with mushroom, green chili and jalapeños and my boyfriend got the cheeseburger and fries. Since it was our first time there he gave us a free drink which was nice. The food tasted really fresh and the cheese steak I got was so good. Probably one of the best cheese steaks I've tried so far in Arizona. The bread was soft and not to hard and the meat was flavorful. My boyfriend also enjoyed his cheeseburger because it wasn't greasy. The owner also came to our table before he left to check on us and to see how the food tasted. I would defiantly recommend this place and will be coming back."}
{"text":"The best cheese steak around.  The portion sizes are ginormous,  could easily share a sandwich.  The bun is soft and the meat is so tender.  We also ordered chicken wings and the have to be the largest wing size around.  If you're craving a hearty steak sandwich this is the to check out. We had no idea they serVed thrifty ice cream too.  We may come back just for ice cream.  Very pleased with this Mike's cheese steak.  Only suggestion is to see them clean their rest rooms and add a mirror in the ladies room."}
{"text":"Hard to find a place where the owner comes out and greets you if he's there and it's your first time there. Very friendly and very good at recommending foods. Great music too.  The FOod was delicious."}
{"text":"will not be coming back! owner talked down to his worker ordering him to \"GO GET A BOX FOR HIM\" no please very mean tone. also the owner  tried to have me pay for another order the yelp application made a duplicate for. cant believe how  nonprofessional this man and his own business. BEWARE!"}
{"text":"AMAZING GREAT cheese-steaks!!! They are huge for the price, tons of meat, pick your topping. So good!  I'll be coming back again. It's a great find in Gilbert Town Square and it's so nice to find a business that offer a great sandwich.  ** Remember Mike to fuse the roll with the meat & cheese on the grill so the roll get hot.  The best in east valley compare to others here on the east side."}
{"text":"5 STARS for food, but 3 STARS for service. 2nd time getting food from here and food great like the first time but disappointed with the order. Placed order in person for takeout for 3 cheesesteaks. It wasn't busy at all yet and got food to home when was checking to see which is who's realized he made every cheesesteak the same as far as fillings w/ onions, peppers & mushrooms but with the correct cheeses on each. Was it too hard to give what your customer ordered when you clearly have it setup to have them make personalized orders. It's not like I called in the order during lunch rush and quickly spit out the order at you. I made the effort to say each order steadily and in person to avoid a screw up, but you just thought screw it you get what I give you. Change your menu if you want only to offer different cheeses as the only choice customers have to personalized their cheesesteaks then. I wasn't so annoyed before but now getting there. Only reason they get saved is because the food was still good. It's just the principle of the matter."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was top notch. The owner Mike was super cool. Great place great food and will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I had the grilled cheese and fried zucchini! It was yummy and the service is super friendly!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Went to Mike's for the first time yesterday and this is one of our new family spots! Mike, the owner, gave us the low down on how they use fresh, local beef that they pick up daily! Plus the food was AMAZING! Mike was incredibly friendly, had great customer service and we watched several other regulars come in and interact. You could tell this is a local favorite! We will definitely be back! Great service, amazing food, supports other local businesses - what more could you ask for? If you haven't tried yet...GO!"}
{"text":"This place is great I wish I lived closer I would come more often the staff was great it was my first time took the time explain everything to me and even recommend to me what I should get I had Chicago dog it was awesome hands down 6stars out of 5"}
{"text":"We came in towards closing one night and were greeted with friendly smiles and conversation from Mike (the owner). We told him it was our first time in and he was more than happy to go through the menu with us and proceeded to tell us his restaurant is known for their cheesesteaks. The rumble in my stomach and the smells of meat cooking got me to order one immediately with peppers, onions, mushrooms and cheese. We were told it would be about a 10 minute wait and were given complimentary fountain drinks in the meantime. We were also told the restaurant is getting painted and having some minor renovations to look less like an ice cream shop (ie: checkered floors, ice cream pictures posted, etc.). Place is cute with toys and candies for kids and a Coke machine with glass bottles.   When our food arrived, the cheesesteaks were huge and overflowing with meats and toppings! The bread is heavenly mixed with the tender meat, veggies and melting cheese, WOW! I was super hungry and could barely finish the cheesesteak! This is definitely the right place to go if you are hungry and in need of good food!  Oh, and I did get some ice cream to go (chocolate brownie) and that was also good. I could have done without the walnuts though.  Will be back and lucky for me it's so close to home!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today and love it.  The meat is extremely fresh, along with very fresh bread and really good fry's.  I got the 1/3 pounder and a do it yourself. They also offer specialty burgers and my wife had the Jalapeno burger.  I made mine like the old style and it was delicious.  We were greeted by Mike and had a nice conversation.  The service was quick, especially considering they were very busy.  Nothing to complain about here.  We will be returning as soon as possible."}
{"text":"I had my hopes high...and then got let down. First, they forgot the cheese on my philly CHEESE steak. The place was kind of gross and dirty, and the staff was timid teenagers. Nothing wrong with that at all, but mentor them and teach them great customer service. Would probably not return."}
{"text":"Burgers were pretty good. Onion rings were nice too. We also tried the fries. They were basic. Mushroom Swiss burger was good but the mushrooms were raw. Overall, pretty good burger. Little pricey for the quality, but not bad."}
{"text":"GREAT BURGER!!! Fresh beef delivered and hand ground daily.  And fresh mushrooms on the burger!!! Don't pass up this locally-owned treasure!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here in the past when mike was working and the food was very good.  Ordered a Philly Cheesesteak and fries today and was disappointed when I received my order.  The bread was the wrong bread for a Philly Cheesesteak and the bread was stale.  When you took a bite, the bread was dry and crumbled into pieces.  I overheard the table behind me comment on the bread also.  The amount of meat on the sandwich was half as much as my previous times I ate here.  It was $28 for two Philly Cheesesteaks two orders of fries and two drinks.  Not worth the money.  I should have known the restaurant is different when Mike is not in because when I went to sign the IPad after paying, the screen was very dirty.  I told the young person working he should clean the screen and he replied, \"oh.\""}
{"text":"I've been there twice now and both times have been very good. My first time Mike the owner was manning the place solo and since it wasn't busy he took a little time to chat with me. I ordered the Philly and it was very good, the only change I would make is the roll it comes in, it's good, but it's not Corleones. The meat cheese and onion combo did match up though. Overall I would get it again. The onion rings were very nice, the onion was sweet and fairly thick like I like them. A+.  Tonight I went in and ordered the Sliders with bacon and onion. I will definitley get them again. A++  Service both times has been very good, nice young ladies manning the counter. There was a wait, but they told me that up front and the timing worked out fine. A++  I saw the reviews below about being filthy, that's hard to beleive based on my two visits, one busy, one very busy. Place was very clean and I am hard to please. A++  They serve Thrifty brand ice cream, nuff said. A+++++++  Bottom line, I would recommend Mikes and I would take friends there.  P.S. Mike, you do need to get a quality Root Beer in there, that would make me happy."}
{"text":"Great food I had a hamburger and it was perfectly delish. The owner took our order and he was awesome. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"My sister kept saying, \"You gotta' try this place, you gotta'.\"  Well I did, and I thank her very much!  I had the Chicken Philly,with everything and jalapenos.  It was AWESOME.  Great taste, hot and right now...my mouth is watering.  I will add this caveat, the jalapenos, were SPICeeeee!  Too spicy for me, so the cook took it back and dumbed it down for me.  Man, it was delicious, he was very customer service oriented and did a great job on all the food. Amazing that they are not busier, people...go...go!  If you love a Philly, get over there!  Oh, I did have the onion rings, my nephew the fries and both were awesome.  I had to steal some fries from him (yeah, he whined) but they were great...he is slow in moving his basket...all his fault ;-)  He loved the cheeseburger he ordered too. Forgot about that...but he enjoyed it.  They serve ice cream too.  Good place, good food and great service!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. Got a Groupon and figured we would check it out. Fries seemed typical frozen, burger fell flat. Nothing special. Only saving grace was the Shake. You can pick from any of the flavored ice cream, and they had quite a few. Not to mention we watched the kid take our order and walk back, and bare hand touch our burgers. Will we be returning? Mmmm nope."}
{"text":"I'm not the type of person to judge a restaurant based off of appearance , but I do off of the quality of service and product. First and foremost, when coming into the Mike's i knotice that the grill area and floor were quite dirty, along with the aroma of burnt/cooking onion. I, like most people, tend to believe that a book may not be judged by the cover. However, the service in which I received made me realize that is not the case. Approaching the counter my group and I were told they were out of ground beef. The young man that helped me was brash and did not seem to care of what was going on. But I did notice that he had quite the personality when heading back to speak with the other young man handling the grill. Once again , at this point, did not bother me. I sat outside with my sister, brother in law, and two nephews. We and an older couple were the only people there. I order fish and chips. My food was brought out promptly. 2 peices of fish and fries for 9 dollars. The fish was cooked well and the fries were still warm. I was please with my food. This is where my dining experience then goes a bit downhill. I begin to eat my meal, thinking my family's food is coming behind mine. As my meal concluded their's hadn't even started. They waited an additional 15-20 minutes for their food. The young man who took our order, brought out sliders and fries which we did not order. Please remember, we were also told they were out of ground beef. When they brought the cheese steak's and chicken nuggets; the bread was cold, the cheese wasn't melted and the nuggets were pipping hot. This would be good to know before giving them to a child.   I understand the atmosphere that Mike's was attempting to obtain, and the quality of the food that they are reaching for. I suggest a cleaner environment, more service driven employees, and a faster expiditing  process."}
{"text":"Wow! Wanted a burger and got even more.  Great burgers and cheese steaks.   My wife and had a great customer experience and will be bringing our friends back with us"}
{"text":"Love going to Mike's and getting a burger.  They make it how you want and it's always fresh. Their basket of fries is huge!  Mike and staff are always cool and always take the time to come out to visit and provide good service. Great ice cream too!!"}
{"text":"Very good cheesesteak (I had mine with onions, peppers and mushrooms).  Stuffed full of steak - they definitely don't skimp on the steak.  The flavor was great and the sandwich quite juicy - making the bread slightly soggy, but that's hard to avoid.  The sandwich did not fall apart despite a 15 minute drive home.  A very, very good cheesesteak and one of the best I've had in AZ.  The staff and owner were very friendly. The owner handed me  my order, asked if it was my first visit and told me a few things about  his restaurant and their food and preparation. It was a nice touch.  The place itself is quite small with a handful of tables and chairs and a small jukebox playing '60s tunes! (The Beach Boys were playing while I was waiting).  There appeared to be small outdoor patio as well.   My only complaint would be pricing.  The cheesesteak sandwich itself was $8.49 - which is OK if it included fries and a drink.  In order to get a fries and drink with the sandwich, you have to order the combo which adds $3 to your total.  So my total for the sandwich, regular fries and drink was over $12 (including tax).  Seems pretty steep to me - and the only thing preventing me from giving the place 5 stars.   I'd like to try one of their burgers next trip - and try to keep my tab to under $10."}
{"text":"I ordered the cheesesteak w/ onions and peppers. It was really good, especially compared to Charleys or other fast food chain style that are microwaved. I havent had a cheesesteak this good in a very long time. This came off a real cooktop! Good thing I was hungry, I was able to down the whole thing. My wife got the chicken sandwich w/ pepperjack cheese. It didn't look to spectacular, but she said it was tasty.  Thirfty Brand ice cream. Lots of flavors. Big plus!  The decor is like a 50's vibe, old jukebox, black and white checkered tile, red accents. Guy really cares about the food and making people happy. Was pretty empty on a sunday around noon, everyone must still be in church!  The kid who took my order was super friendly, explained their popular items and was polite. The owner? checked on us once the food was out to make sure everything was okay."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! At my work we do a Wednesday Cheesesteak run at least once a month!  We give Mike a call, each steak is ordered different. We arrive to freshly Cooke steaks, boxed and ready to go, each labeled so there is no guessing which is which."}
{"text":"Only been one time, but it's safe to say I had an above average experience! I ordered the half pound Jalapeño Jack burger with a side of onion rings. The burger entailed a perfect spice, high quality meat (from Midwestern meats), and flavorful cheese. The onion rings were really great too! Decent portions here, I was definitely full.  My only problem is that my bill was $11 and change. A bit pricey for a no frills in and out styled place that caters to those who need a quick bite to eat after work or another event. I didn't even order a drink, mind you. Regardless it's but a minor set back in what was a really solid burger! I'd recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Cheesesteak was really good. Wife liked the Chicago dog. Fries were crispy. Mozzarella sticks were good and not greasy.  Would recommend eating here."}
{"text":"This place is a very small mom and pop type burger joint that feels almost hidden in plain sight. I've eaten here a few times, and it has been a pleasant experience. The 1/3 lb burger was juicy and traditional, and the cheesesteak was delicious and plentiful. The most unique trait about Mike's is its fun, vintage environment. I loved munching on some fries while the jukebox blasted classic swing tunes. On occasion, I really felt like getting up and dancing to the music! Overall, it's a decent spot to get your burger fix."}
{"text":"A Groupon led us here, with all the great reviews, and being just around the corner from our house, we were excited to try this place. I will NEVER go back again...I will not even use the remaining Groupon that we have, that's how disappointing this place was!   We went on Friday, 2/27/15. We placed our order, 1 cheesesteak w/Cheese Whiz, 1 cheesteak combo w/American & Provolone. Order #37. 20 minutes later, order #40 goes out, # 41 goes to the counter to inquire where their order is... still waiting for #37! Young lady behind the counter asks us if were are still waiting, YES, says she will check on it... never see her again. 30 minutes in, we go up to counter and ask how much longer it will be, apparently the kitchen lost our ticket, said they would get it right out. Someone finally brings our order, in a bag (in was NOT a To Go order!) no fries in sight, and the sandwiches were made wrong! How difficult was our order?! It wasn't! Both sandwiches hasd white cheese on them...mine was supposed to be with Cheese Whiz, so what did they do? Left on the white cheese and threw on some Cheese Whiz...whatever. Since they didn't bring fries with our order, they said they would get a basket right out to us... they came cold and hard, we did not eat them. They offered us free ice cream to make up for the issues we had, my boyfriend enjoyed his Praline Pecan however my mint chip was old and chalky, I threw it out. As a side note: The sandwiches themselves, were actually pretty good, which is why this review gets 2 stars instead of 1, but in no way were they good enough to make up for this HORRIBLE experience.  We weren't the only table having issues; a man next to us waited forever for a burger, they offered him free ice cream as well. The table of 4 in the back corner had a problem, 1 ladies order was completely messed up...they said they would re-make hers also.  Maybe if kids hadn't been milling in and out of there to chit-chat will the staff, they may have been able to get something right. We ran into a regular customer outside who said the owner was out of town at a swim meet w/his kids... maybe he needs a new manager if he isn't going to be there to supervise this place. How it has such great reviews, I will never know."}
{"text":"Just went for the first time and i had the original philly cheesesteak which was pretty good and on a nice roll. My girls burger was good as well. Fries are standard frozen and ok at best. Mike seemed like a nice guy and came over to greet us. They seem to have a good selection of ice cream as well.  Here's where i'm lost in the burger world. I used to complain about the prices at 5 guys but it seems they have set the bar on pricing because everyone is catching up. It seems that 2 burger/frie/coke combo prices have exploded! No? Damn near 25.00 for two combo's ? I don't see the value here.  No wonder IN N OUT is packed all day everyday.  To be fair.....Mikes does second burger 1/2 price on tuesdays."}
{"text":"Cheesesteak was very good, lots of cheese and LOADED with good, tender beef. A little bready, but the bread is darn good too. Onion rings were a disappointment. Appeared to be from frozen prefab, a touch greasy, but with a decent crunch and the onion didn't pull out on the first bite, so OK. I'll try fries next time. Overall a good sandwich. Good service too. Just two young guys, maybe even teens, running the whole show on a Sunday night as far as I could tell. Quick to take the order and then run it out right to the table. I'd definitely give it another shot, the sandwich really was damn good."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Mike's to have dessert after our lunch at Sal's pizza next door.  They have a large selection of 'real' ice cream. After looking at all the creamy yumminess that was staring back at me through the glass, I decided on one scoop of the salted caramel on a sugar cone. I wasn't paying attention while the kid was scooping, because what I got was one scoop of plain vanilla on a sugar cone. I didn't realize it until after I started eating it, but since you can't really return ice cream after it's been licked, I continued eating. No big deal.  I will be back here for a treat every now and again."}
{"text":"We went here after seeing a story in the Chandler Republic about that shopping center. Figured after a movie it would be great to check out a local joint. And burgers-can't go wrong! Well you can go wrong. Really wrong. There was no welcome by the teens working. Ok fine, we ordered basically the same burgers but for some reason the girl offered my wife a combo deal but not me. Uh ok. This was after she had to make sure they had burgers! Really? Maybe call it Mikes cheesesteak and sometimes burgers. We placed the order-$25 for two burgers and fries. So my expectations were high. I'll pay good money for a good burger. This is a Friday night and there was no one in there. We sat at our dirty booth for over 20 minutes for the food. When it came I had well over done onion rings and my wife had half cooked fries with her meal. Ok so sides are not your main thing here fine. On to the \"burger\" waiting that long one would expect something glorious. But you're given this thin patty (they claim 1/3 pound but McDonald's has bigger patties) that's on a super dry bun. In fact I've never had a burger so dry in my life. Thank god we had a drink at the table to choke it down. They cooked every bit of goodness out of that burger and then longer. It tasted weird as well. I question the freshness. I'll update this if I get sick. What we should've done is just donated $25 to this place and went to a real burger joint. There are tons of them around so you'd think this place would keep up with that to make a good name for itself. But there's no effort, no passion. It's just a bunch of over cooked meat placed on dry buns. We gave it try...support a local business but they failed us. We won't be back. Excuse me while I get some water, my mouth is still dry from those hockey pucks."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best cheesesteaks as you can make it any way you want. Workers are friendly and when the owner is there he always comes out to see how your meal is. Choice of sides. I picked the fries and they were hot and fresh. Noticed most of the negative reviews were from deliveries so just take the extra time and come visit this friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"The only cheesesteak place I would eat, not a big cheesesteak fan but the Chipotle cheesesteak here is just awesome. :)"}
{"text":"Went here while my parents were visiting...had some of the best cheeseburgers and cheesesteaks I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Cheesesteak was ok nothing special didn't eat it went to McDonald's fries were good though 15 minute delivery"}
{"text":"I was sold once I saw MIDWESTERN MEATS.  And it was definitely amazing.  The garlic fries are so good!  And burgers were awesome too.  Prices are very good for such great quality."}
{"text":"Love this place took my fiancé to this place for a quick bite also brought the dog. owner let us know it's a dog friendly patio and the burgers where awesome great service and awesome fries great place for cheap date night ...."}
{"text":"I placed an order on grub hub and added on extras such as bacon and extra patty along with cheese for the cheezey fries. Not only did I not receive bacon on my burger and cheese on my French fries. The grub hub messed up my address and took the delivery driver calling me five different times to get my address correct.  I called the store and was told that bacon is a free add, however you have to pay for it on grub hub and needless to say the burger was a complete waste of money and time.  Ps: a note for the \"manager\" when a customer calls to tell you this issue your answer shouldn't be oh we are out of bacon that's why you didn't get it. The correct move is to call the customer and inform him as soon as the order was placed. Just a frindly tip from someone who worked I. The food industry.."}
{"text":"Waste of time and money.   We waited 35 minutes and paid $35 for two cheese-steaks and a fish sandwich (no french fries or other sides).   We saw at least ten customers leave due the excessive wait time.  One family requested a refund and left after waiting close to 30 minutes for their food.  At one point customers were being told it would take an hour to prepare their food.  It wasn't even that busy.  The dinning area was hot and filthy.  The floors, windows and counters looked like they had not been cleaned in some time.  We will not be returning to Mike's again and will be sure to tell our friends and family about our bad experience at Mike's.    Shame on you Mike's."}
{"text":"Dogs and Cheesesteak for dinner. Wasn't impressed and neither was my son. They have Thrifty's ice cream. Will go back for ice cream!"}
{"text":"It's a shame- the burgers are actually good but I can't get over seeing the employee scoop my fries with his bare hands.  Ewwww.  Luckily, I said something & got new, untouched fries but can't shake the image"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim because the place next door was closed for summer vacation.  We got cheeseburgers and onion rings and shakes. Very good burgers -cooked perfect, onion rings we're the BEST!!!!  They have Thrifty Ice cream of which I'm not a huge fan of, but shakes were ok. Small place, but they do have a patio which, during the right time if the year would be nice. Would definitely go again to try other things on menu & have more beer battered onion rings!!!!"}
{"text":"I am going to have to rate this joint how Yelp's star system works. Their food is just A-OK. It isn't any special. The food is your typical greasy style american. Hotdogs, burgers, cheesesteaks. But! The owner is very friendly and helpful and I would probably try this place again just because he is so welcoming."}
{"text":"First thing, employee is just sitting down waiting for clients. Asked about their specialty burgers and the employee didn't explain throughly. I ordered the jalapeño jack and let me tell you; nothing special about it! It was undercooked and had no flavor! Not coming back! I should've just stick to Sal's Pizza next door!"}
{"text":"What an awesome find this place is.  The owner Mike came over to make sure we were taken care of.  The cheesesteak was the best one I've ever had.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am sure when the \"A\" team is working this place is just fine for a Gilbert palette. I encountered the \"B\" team, however, and was very disappointed. The food was slow, overdone, and either the girls smoked up before their shift or really, really need some incentive the focus on their jobs."}
{"text":"We got  the philly cheesesteak and the jalepeno jack burger. Both were cooked to perfection and delicious! We also got the fries and onion rings and they were both great too.  Everything was cooked fresh to order and everything was fresh tasting. I would highly recommend mikes and we will for sure be back soon. Great service to go with the great food!"}
{"text":"Great Chicago style place. Solid burger made from fresh beef. The chicken cheesesteak with Jus is AMAZING. I will crave that. So glad this is in our hood!"}
{"text":"So much fun!! This blast from the past was just the treat we were looking for.  Fresh waffle cone anyone? She made it right on the spot.  The weather was perfect for the patio.  However, I had to challenge the husband to pinball...the inside is family friendly too!    Perfect for treating our youngest's riding her bike without training wheels!! Thanks Mike's!!"}
{"text":"Took 30 minutes to get our burgers and they got my order wrong.  Also, the fries were limp and tasteless.  The burger and onion rings did taste good, but I would not recommend this place due to the bad service."}
{"text":"Service, service, service!  Told him we were new and instantly got 10% discount. Customized my order then took another 15% off my order. Wow. Food was fabulous"}
{"text":"I love mikes. Probably because my name is mike, too. A young man named Luke helped me with my order and he was by far the most professional and best looking one there. The cheesesteak was incredible, definitely go with the cheese whiz on it. Delicious Ice cream too!"}
{"text":"We like to support locally owned businesses as much as possible and this is the reason why. We were greeted by the owner and he explained the menu and our options. He made it known that he uses only fresh, quality ingredients. Pops and I each got burgers and fries...both we cooked perfectly and taste awesome. Next time we're going to try the cheesesteaks. You can tell when someone puts their heart into their craft and that makes all the difference"}
{"text":"I checked this place out for the first time with the man. I think this is just a locally owned burger place. The burgers were spot on, so fresh and tasty. Not only are the patties hand pattied and delivered daily from a local meat company in Mesa, but they are reasonably priced. We went on a Wednesday and they had a special going where you could get a $1.00 ice cream with any meal purchase and if I remember correctly, Phillies were a $1 off too.   The ice cream was super tasty. I've never heard of the Thrify brand but wow...creamy and delicious!  I think the owner was doing the cooking and he actually came out when we walked in and explained the menu to us and gave me his recommendations when I asked. Everything is made to order and I love how fresh everything was."}
{"text":"Great place for casual bite. Had the hamburger, it was good. Fries were good. Service was excellent. Good value. Recommend a visit. Ice cream and home-made shakes too!"}
{"text":"Mike's cooks up a really great burger and the curly fries are to die for. Be sure to ask for jalapenos on your cheese burger for a little extra zing"}
{"text":"We were just browsing through yelp one night looking for a place with good burgers.  We stumbled upon Mike's and decide to give it a try.  Upon arrival we were promptly greated by the friendly staff.  We ordered a cheeseburger, cheesesteak, and chili cheese fries.  They also serve thrifty/riteaid ice cream! Honestly we didn't think much or have any expectations for this place.. but boy did they give us a suprise.    Cheeseburger- the most moist, perfectly cooked, delicious burger I have had in the east valley! I even liked it better than Rehab burger. My boyfriend agrees!  Cheesesteak-  Theres something about that fluffy buttery bread they put everything in.. grilled onions and cheese so good! The beef was so tender too!  Chili cheese fries- this was the only thing I didn't really like because they used nacho cheese/ cheese wiz on top.  I think this is personal though, I am really not a big fan of none stringy cheese.  The fries were good though!  The only thing I wished for here was for their cheese to be stringy! But other than that you have a great place to bring kids! Awesome food and ice cream!"}
{"text":"I grabbed a cheesesteak to go from here today. I'll keep it short and sweet...   The food came out FAST!  Ingredients were fresh and premium quality The bread was unique to other cheesesteak sandwich places in the Valley - very soft and chewy and fresh.  Went with his recommendation for cheese, and it was a perfect combo. Meat was cooked to perfection.  I ate it in the car before I could hit a third stoplight on my way home, it smelled so good.  I loved it - one of the best cheesesteak sandwiches I've had in Arizona. I will be back."}
{"text":"All I can say is OMG!!! This was the best cheese-stake I had since leaving the east coast. I will be a frequent customer!!"}
{"text":"Mike's cheesesteaks are authentic (to this former decade-long Philly resident), with decent rolls. It's definitely better to dine-in so the steam doesn't make the bread soggy in the to-go container. The fries are only so-so, and I have had a steak that used really sinew-y meat before, and that was a turnoff. Yet, I went back anyway and it was fine, so that might have been a fluke."}
{"text":"AMAZING cheesesteaks!!! They are huge, tons of cheese, pick your topping. So good! These are addicting and I will be coming back again. It's a great find in Gilbert Town Square and it's so nice to find something other than McDonalds and other fast food chains. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"My kids and I absolutely feel in love!!! Great people and amazing food!! If you're looking for fresh quality food and service you must go here and tell your friends! The owner is amazing and took time from what he was doing to make sure the kids and I enjoyed our food. You don't find many places like this anymore."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a date night planned to see The Avengers: Age of Ultron at the regal theater, so I purchased a groupon for Mike's because it was so close the the theater. It is a cute diner with nice employees. There were several families there enjoying their food. I got the bacon cheeseburger and it was decent. Nothing special and somewhat over priced for what it was, the highlight was the toasted bun fur sure. My boyfriend got the traditional cheese steak with cheese whizz. He liked it ok but noted there was way too much bread. All in all I give it 3 stars but will probably only go once more to use my other groupon."}
{"text":"I have had lots of cheese steaks in my life. But none of them were as good as Mikes. Mike's has great service and I have been here over a dozen times and have nothing but great service and a killer cheese steak. He uses high quality meat and super fresh soft rolls that are incredible. Keep up the great work Mike."}
{"text":"Ate here with my son for dinner on a Saturday night. My son had the bacon cheeseburger and I ordered a Philly cheese steak. My son loved his burger. I tasted it and thought it was just ok (especially for $8.50). I have had better. Now the philly was down right delicious! And big!  One of the best I have had in a long time. Well worth the price of 9 plus. I personally did not like their ice tea. Not a Gold Peak tea fan at all. Dinner came out to $27 for the burger, cheese steak,  two fries, two drinks, and a burger to go for the hubby. And that was with a 25% first timer discount. Which was very cool. So, a little pricy but will return, but only for the yummy cheese steak."}
{"text":"Arrived at 12:45 PM after placing an order for pick up. When an employee finally came out from the back at 12:58 PM I was told the order wasn't received. Even after showing the confirmation email, was told I didn't order correctly. Maybe the food is good, but I'll never find out due to terrible service."}
{"text":"This a nice find. Cooks a real good bacon cheese burger with option of fries or onion rings with the combo. Yeah, and has unsweetened ice tea...none of that flavored tea I dislike. All home made and fresh ingredients.   Highly recommend and worth the drive."}
{"text":"AWFUL! DIRTY! NASTY! This place seems so inviting from the outside, then you walk inside... filthy and unsanitary. Shouldn't have even ordered food after seeing that. Got a cheesesteak because I thought they would be good considering cheesesteak is in there logo. HORRIBLE! The meat tasted like it had freezer burn. I feel like for the price, the food could at least be FRESH! Damn near $12.00 for the worst sandwich ever! DO NOT be fooled by the exterior of this restaurant.   Not to mention, I called to complain about my sandwich and the \"cook\" that made my food answered. Told him how we didn't even eat two bites. And all he said was, \"I'm sorry that happened.\"   How is this place still in business and how has the health department not shut it down."}
{"text":"Super average burgers. Not sure what all the hype is with these 5 star reviews.  Took a large family here and out of the 8 of us, 8 of us agrees it was average and In n Out or Fatburger would have been money better spent.  Skip."}
{"text":"The meat really is the main attraction at this homage to the '50s. You get a friendly greeting when you walk in the door (typically from mike). Weather you get a cheesesteak or a burger it is always cooked to juicy perfection. The onion rings are great too. You order at the counter and get your own drinks but the staff delivers your food (in about 10 minutes), always makes sure it is right and good. They also are do gooders - participating in meal match.org and I have seen them get involved with school fundraisers too."}
{"text":"I just can't.  We have attempted to eat here on two occasions and before ordering, we walked out both times. I don't get this place!  Sorry but its just a NO-GO for us!"}
{"text":"Seen this place on yelp for awhile but finally have them a try with my mom and husband today. We ordered a little bit of everything. Cheesesteaks, wings, onion rings, chicken nuggets, and fries. You definitely get a lot of food for your money. The cheesesteak was overloaded with chopped prime rib with the right amount of onions. The bread was the perfect consistency to hold all the meat without making it soggy at all. Wings were delish and crispy. Fries and onion rings were good. I believe the onion rings were beer battered. Overall really tasty. Best part is you have to save room for dessert because they serve THRIFTYS ice cream!!! My ultimate fav!"}
{"text":"This place is by far the best burgers in town.  I would put this place up against any burger joint, any day hands down.  Mike really knows how to make a great burger. 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good burger so when we read the reviews we decided to give Mike's  a try! Ordered the hamburger and asked for grilled onions(I like them really cooked) and they cooked them to perfection. The Riccobono bakery bun was warmed and the hamburger was delicious! Best Burger since moving to the Valley 12 years ago! The crinkle fries were also cooked crispy. Mike the owner chatted with us and we will go back and support this local business."}
{"text":"Two burgers, one water over 16.00. Food average at best, could name a dozen better places!   Wanted to enjoy it, but didnt. Do yourself a favor and pass on this place. Also, you can see by the recent reviews that the gig is up and the truth is coming out about this establishment."}
{"text":"After our dismal experience the previous week getting a burger, I remember some of the reviews I had read mentioned Mike's. So after C had his rehearsal, we decided to check it out.  Right off the bat I knew things were going to be much different than our experience the week before. Mike was sitting at the cash register and welcomed us the moment we walked in. He asked me if we had been in before and I told him no. Mike was very polite and explained his menu.  C ordered the Kids Sliders ($4.99). There were a couple of nice sliders with thick slices of cheese on top. C's meal also came with a nice pile of fries. Great deal for the $. C said the sliders were very good.   I ordered the B.Y.O. Cheese steak ($9.49). The filling was good as was the bread. I do feel the price was a bit high for the size of the sandwich.  C is currently learning about the 50's in him music class at school. He loved the interior of Mike's and talked about it the entire time we were eating lunch. This place does have a great vibe. Although it was a tad chilly the day we were there, I did notice some patio seating and I'm sure on a nice day it would be great sitting outside enjoying Mike's food.  Good experience with Mike. Great Kids Meal Deal. A bit pricey on the Cheese Steak. Clean facility. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"I can sum this place up in one word. Unimpressed. Mediocre food that was way overpriced. I had the cheesesteak combo with fries and a drink for just under $15. Not the worst cheesesteak but definitely not worth $15. I don't plan on returning. Go to Capriottis or Forefathers for a great cheesesteak that's worth the price."}
{"text":"Very good hamburgers and cheese steak. They also have thrifty ice cream and tons of it! They will make any flavor into a shake. Fast service. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Mike's is a great place for a Philly cheesesteak! The owner is a nice guy, we see & talk to him each time we go in. I lived in Philly for a while and I've been looking for a place that could serve a Philly up the way I had it back then, Mike's got it covered. The prices are good and and he really works hard to make his customers happy. The Philly is a good size and fills me up so much that I can barely touch the fries.  I recently discovered their onion rings and added them to my list of cravings. Then they've got some good ice cream to satisfy our sweet tooth. I've lost track of the times that my husband has brought Mike's home. Their Philly's do great as take out, they don't get mushy after the car trip home (we're about 5 miles away).  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"The hot wings have a really good spiciness to them and the cheese steak is great quality meat I do prefer their hamburgers over the cheese sticks though"}
{"text":"Food I good...slowest service ever. 2 trips now and it takes forever to get your food. Very friendly but way too slow."}
{"text":"We stopped here for ice cream after having pizza at Sal's next door. This seems like a nice  little lunch box. We just had the ice cream so this review is based on that. The server was friendly. I had cherry amaretto ice cream. It was pretty good. Nothing fantastic but it hit the spot. They have a nice selection  of sandwiches and hotdogs. May try them some day. Watch for the review when we do."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my burger and onion rings very much! The burger had a garlic taste to it which was nice and with a toasted bun, it really worked. I was able to order it how I wanted... cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that there not much space for eating. Rather cramped in there with only about 6-7 tables."}
{"text":"Philly is unreal. Best I've had in Arizona and I've worked hard trying them. Burgers are excellent as well. Mike is a master. Don't hesitate."}
{"text":"It's not like you can find a good cheesesteak place in the valley, right? Yeah you can! It turns out! Who knew! I loved this place and the food was great! Prepared fresh right when we ordered. They even have Thrifty ice cream (which is the BEST) so we tried to save room for our huge scoops of that. They explained to us what they offer and how they prepare it as well as their recommendations for us. I had the cheesteak with onions and peppers. They put a white cheddar cheese sauce on the bottom and then flip the meat over on top to cover it. Oh ma gosh! So good! They serve onion rings or fries and also feature other food like burgers. I haven't gotten a chance to try their other food yet but I am sure it's just as good! The restaurant has a small patio and adequate seating inside. It looks like an old diner or coffee shop inside. Very cool find! Different than your chain restaurants and great service too!"}
{"text":"I went to Mike's to try their cheesesteaks, and I was pleased. The bun and meat were all very good, seasoned well and juicy. Had provolone, onions, mushrooms and jalapenos on it and was very tasty with just the right amount of heat. Onion rings and fries were good too. At this point the only two places in the valley I would eat a cheesesteak is Mike's and Capriotti's. Wife had fish and chips and was also good...much better and cheaper than nearby full service restaurants charging twice as much. Had some yummy ice cream to finish it off. Only complaint was the tables were dirty (previous diners left a mess behind)."}
{"text":"I wish i would have read the reviews because on reviewer Bobby H. nailed it right on the head.  The most disappointing part is the bread.  It does not have the ablitliy to hold up to the steaming meat causing the bread to just get absolutely soft and mushy.  A nice Italian bread is definitely in need.  Another thing needed is a good  sharp provolone cheese.  The meat is good but seems to be missing some seasoning but i'm just nitpicking here.  One major plus is that they have crinkle fries...yahoo!  It's hard to find so it's always bonus to have."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian beef sandwich, it was huge. Onion rings and ice creams also quite good :)"}
{"text":"I had the WORSE experience. Mike, the owner, decided to curse out the grub hub representative (obviously we ordered via grub hub) when they called to check on the order. We ordered at 6:15. I contacted grub hub an hour in, to check the order, they said he said 25 minutes. Another hour goes by.....that's when I contacted them again in which Mike, the owner, cursed out the representative and hung up. It's currently 9pm. 10 minutes ago MIKE showed up at my door after we canceled the order (wouldn't you do the same) and admitted to this but said it was because Grub hub was in the wrong. We, out of principal, denied taking the food as we canceled the order and therefore did NOT pay. We were NOT looking for a handout. We don't want your food! We were respectful when he showed up, although I really didn't want to be. He got upset when we declined taking the free food,  and stormed off cursing under his breath. NOT WORTH IT. TURN AROUND. DO NOT ORDER."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the onion rings were really good, the bread for the cheese steaks was really good, the fries were ok.  Do you hear a but? You do!   I have 2 picky eaters, we ordered 2 cheesesteaks plain, just meat and cheese. We got carry out so when we opened the sandwiches we were surprised to see onions in both of them. The onions were chopped tiny and mixed in with the meat. Picking them out was a process. Not only were there onions but there was as much onion as there was meat. Pretty shocking after seeing all the great reviews. You'd think someone would mention that.   Will not return."}
