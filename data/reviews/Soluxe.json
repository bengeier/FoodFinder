NOT A GOOD PLACE FOR 1HR LUNCH BREAKS.

I was here for lunch on a weekday and the staff forgot to submit my order onto the computer system until I wanted to add another item 20 mins later and they came back saying \"I don't know where your order is\". The manager then found the order slip beside the computer and just entered it as is and didn't expedite the order. He acted like nothing wrong had happened and when I brought it to his attention that we are in a rush, he said the \"food is coming, just wait, I rushed it\", however it was a complete lie as all the tables after us received their food first.

The food is fair, nothing special. We ordered several dim sum items and most were over cooked and felt store bought. We also had a Chicken clay pot rice where the rice was under cooked. 

After the meal, I was quite furious and late as well, So I paid quickly at the front and didn't leave a tip as I was extremely dis-satified with the service. I then proceeded to grab my sweater and head out, when the waiter came chasing after me asking for a tip. I tried to explain to him that his forgetfulness has caused me to be late and I was not satisfied with his service, therefore I am not tipping. His instant response was \"That didn't happen\" and proceeded with Chinese words calling me cheap. As I didn't have anymore time to explain to him, I left as he was yelling at me in Chinese. By far one of the worse customer service I have experienced in my life.

So I didn't understand how this restaurant hasn't changed owners as usually most Chinese restaurants that are as poor quality like this one usually do in the Calgary Chinese Restaurant Scene until I googled \"Soluxe\", Soluxe is actually a Chinese Company that focuses on providing catering services for CNOOC and its subsidiaries which in Calgary is Nexen. Then everything started to make sense, this place is actually an off-site cafeteria for the employees that CNOOC brought over for the takeover. The buffet that I asked about and was told its was for staff only wasn't for restaurant staff but actually the CNOOC staff.

It is actually quite sad that this place is ran so poorly and has no reason to change as their primary objective is to serve CNOOC. This is sad because it means that Calgary will lose a prime restaurant spot in Chinatown for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"We finally tried this place today! and my wife really enjoyed it; I mean it's authentic Northern-Style Chinese food. Oily, yes, but they locked so much flavour in their oils you can ignore it. I don't know how many times I've wanted to try this place; from the first time I saw them open to the countless times I've walked by but are at U&Me, Silver Dragon, Kim Chee House or anything else but Soluxe in their stead. For those of you who don't know, my wife is Chinese and she knows her Chinese food. She also mentioned their food is oily, but did continue saying but it's real. If you want another authentic Chinese dining experience in Calgary; don't skip this place like I did countless times; it's worth it.
Keep in mind it's not always busy and you'll wonder if they're open; but they are, of course, when they have the open sign lit up! A little on the pricier side of Chinese restaurants in Calgary, but it truly is a different experience. They even have frog!!! yum and you don't have to have it Szechwan style; just ask them to make it not spicy! trust me; you want to ask them if you've never had it before and want to actually finish the dish. Deep fried pork bones?! oh yeah!!! really good, but best to share with at least 4 people.
Peace!"}
{"text":"The restaurant had the northern China cuisine before. As they have changed the chef, the taste is now more to the southern China cuisine, but still have pretty good northern China dishes as well. Soluxe has two private rooms, one of them is quite big and very suitable for a private lunch/dinner meeting. You would have to book it in advance for the private room as it is hard to find in Calgary for such a big private room."}
{"text":"Service is good, food was great! The shrimp stir fry with tea leaves was yummy! Eggplant pot plate was awesome too. They specialize in Northern China Cuisine."}
{"text":"I came here at 7:30 to eat dinner. I ordered 2 dishes (shrimp and stir fry vegetables) the first dish came out 45 minute after ordering and the second dish took another 30 minute for 2 simple dishes. The taste of the food was plain. There's also one other thing! They ran out of rice!! What Chinese restaurant has no rice. We finally left at 9. 

The next time we decided to give it another try. This time we ordered 3 dishes (shrimp, chicken, vegetables). The shrimp came 30 minutes after ordering. Then the vegetables came another 20 minutes after. Vegetables were super spicy so we told them and they said we can change to something else. We said we would like the Chinese broccoli (Gai lan) instead. About 20 minutes after, the chicken came and it was old and tasteless.  Then another 20 minutes later, the next dish came but it was not the right one. We said this is not what we ordered and they said we didn't have the Chinese broccoli. They never told us about it before making some totally random dish. We just cancelled and left. That $40 was totally not worth it whatsoever. I could get so much better food at any other place for the same amount. 

I would totally never come here ever again even if it's free!"}
{"text":"This place went downhill period. They have a new chef, thus a new menu, and new(worst) flavours. I was actually looking forward to a special dish, as I liked it very much when I first had it in the summer of 2015. However, when the waitress brought the dish to our table, I knew the presentation is different from last time. Hoping the flavour would remain same, I was totally wrong after having the first bite. Ingredients tasted like being undercooked and the flavours didn't blend in together. I raised the question to a waitress and she grabbed a spoon \"scanning\" the dish, then left without saying anything but \"I see.\" She never came back! I overheard she spoke Cantonese to a waiter telling him about my complaint. That's it. My party did not enjoy our meal at all, nor did we finished it, and had to leave with empty stomachs. Never go back again. Avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Wow.  Talk about going completely downhill.  This is my first visit after about a year ago and the menu is different, the staff is different, and I can't even comment on the food because I didn't have over an hour to wait.  Everyone knows the lunch hour is busy.  So do you make sure you have enough kitchen staff to cook around lunch? My friend and I waited 45 minutes after we ordered and our food still didn't arrive.  My coworker was sitting at the table next to us and their food was slowly trickling out from the kitchen.  

The wait staff are SO disorganized.  It so happened that my coworker and I both ordered the same dish but theirs went to us (same dish but different size).  We actually started eating it (after confirming it twice that it is the size we ordered) and then the staff figured out the error so guess what... the server grabbed the dish off our table and put it onto theirs.  Um, really? Good thing I'm not infectious with anything (I did tell my coworker that I ate some, but she was fine).  No one has any idea of what we ordered.  The manager / supervisor came by and said the dish I picked is not available.  First of all, I didn't order that dish.  And second of all, you tell me this 40 minutes after I ordered? So I told our server that we were leaving, and he's like no no, I'll make sure your food comes out NOW. Two minutes later, he's holding someone else's dish and then asked if that's mine.  Yeah, we left on the spot.

We then walked across the street to Delicious Country and ordered, ate, paid and left within 20 minutes.  I'm done with this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was worrying my mom insisted on trying this restaurant, but it was surprisingly good food wise.   We had a Cantonese dinner for 2 dishes (from a selections of over 45 dishes) for under $30. We had the braised tofu, fish, mushroom and vegetable hot pot, and oyster omelette.

The services however was very slow, the men bathroom was out of paper towels, and one of the two toilets was completely out of toilet papers.

What a shame, considering the good is worth 4.5/5, but services and washroom cleanliness is 1/5!

What a pity!"}
{"text":"We were not able to fine in so we grabbed our food to go but it was delicious and good quality dim sum. We love when they are pushing carts (which they were) so we will definitely have to be back to enjoy the dine in experience."}
{"text":"Service was not bad, chairs way too low and my 1 authentic Chinese friend said dim sum was not up to par although it was ok to the untrained taste bud."}
{"text":"Oh gosh I hope this place is not the new standard in Calgary. My face started feel bloated after the first few bites from the MSG overload. Service is horrendous, as they like to leave you to sit and simmer for 30mins and never come back to take your order.
Never. Again."}
{"text":"If you are looking for light and healthy food, this restaurant is not for you. However, if you feel like drinking some beer with greasy food, you will like it.

*you will have to wave your hand to order, don't wait for them to come to order. Just a tip :p"}
