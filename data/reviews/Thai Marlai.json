{"text":"First good Thai food we have found in the north Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Best food I've had in a long time!  The Thai Marlai chicken and Kang Dang curry dishes were delicious. Very high quality. 
I will be dining at Thai Marlai for years to come."}
{"text":"Tom YUMMY!  Delicious Thai imo. Had softshell crab in basil sauce, Thai dumping, vegetable mussamun curry, tom yum seafood, and tom ka gai. All excellent to very good (the crab has been better on other visits).  Curry was delicious.  We (2 adults and 4 kids ages 10-2)  called in from the road in the middle of a 9 hr. roadtrip and the food was piping hot and waiting when we arrived! Extra friendly service, very accommodating of kids. We love it and stop here often when in town or passing through. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Great Thai dishes, great lunch prices.  Kind of hard to find next to the Salvation Army, but definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"This is my go-to restaurant when I've had a long day and don't feel up to cooking. It's a family-run place and they always make me feel very welcome. Service is friendly and efficient, and they accomodate groups well. I've been told it is very authentic Thai food (although I've never been to Thailand so I can't say for sure). My favorite is the Mussamun curry (#23), but all the curries are good, as is the Pad Thai. I generally go with the 1-star level of spice, and that's plenty for me (I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to spicy food). Final note: this place is great for vegetarians, as many of their entrees can be ordered vegetarian (with tofu and sometimes extra veggies)."}
{"text":"Lettuce wraps and the fresh rolls were delicious. Service was good and the staff was really nice.  good local place."}
{"text":"Thai Marlai is fantastic! It is the BEST place in the area to get Thai food. I love getting the Pineapple Fried Rice. It actually comes baked in a pineapple and includes chicken and shrimp. It's slightly expensive but completely worth it. It is a gourmet entree that will, in fact, last you two meals. I love this place."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the Charlotte area.  Better than Thai Taste or Basil (frequenters at both).  Pad See Ew is incredible.  Pad Thai also best in Charlotte.  Spice rack is the way to go; they offer a couple of different concoctions that other places do not offer.  My wife and I found this place about two months ago, and we now eat there every week because I crave it.  We tend to be pretty picky when it comes to food but we have been really impressed by this place."}
{"text":"Food quality is below average and the food is over priced. Ingredients are cheap and recipes are weak. 

It is a real shame we need a good Thai food place. I don't mind paying if the quality is there. But it sucks when the food is poor to mediocre and the price is high.

Oh well drive to Thai Emerald!"}
{"text":"When I walked in yesterday for lunch I said \"I was told you have the best Pad Thai in the world\"!  My waitress said \"right here\"!!!  This was my first meal here.  Summer Rolls were very good 4.75 yelp stars - The soup was fine and free - The Spring roll was very good 4.1 stars - Now for the Pad Thai - I've had better, though only in a few places - Their Pad Thai is too sweet and saucy for me, though I know a lot of Americans like it this way (see my photos).  I rate this Pad Thai  2.79 yelp stars.  Though I do not need to taste the Pad Thai again, I will gladly return here to taste some more of their dishes! 

The service was Very Good!  Everyone was very friendly and upbeat!"}
{"text":"Maybe it is because it's the only Thai food close to me, but it is my go to fix for a decent Thai meal.  I typically go for lunch because they have decent specials for about 8 bucks, and otherwise can be a bit pricey for a Thai meal. I lived in San Francisco area for a while and am use to 6 buck gut busters, so I am a bit bias to Thai food and prices.  Overall, great lunch spot and good menu selection."}
{"text":"Great Thai food. I'm a chicken pad Thai guy and its some of the best I have eaten. Recommended."}
{"text":"Aside from the excellent pad thai, the clincher for me is the warm service and friendly attitude of the family-run restaurant.  In Charlotte it's hard to find a decent hole-in-the-wall restaurant with a high-quality menu amidst the sea of chain diners.  Thai Marlai is a welcomed change of flavor for me!"}
{"text":"Massamun Curry is good, but the choice of beef was not very tender for this traditional stew. Thai Iced Coffee was good. Service is very friendly, but has much to be desired. Amex not accepted."}
{"text":"The folks who run this restaurant seem very nice.  Unfortunately, the food just isn't very good at all.  I've tried the food in the restaurant and I've tried take-out.  It really doesn't matter; the quality is lacking.

Our most recent visit (a take-out) order resulted in receiving the wrong soup (and the soup we received we didn't like so it was poured down the drain), a curry dish, an order of Pad Sa Ew, and a fresh roll.  The fresh roll was by far the best item we received.  The ingredients were good, the roll was wrapped well, and the dipping sauce was very tasty.  Unfortunately, neither of the entrees came close to the appetizer in quality.  The Pad Sa Ew had a fair amount of broccoli in it, and that was the best thing that can be said for the dish.  It was lacking flavor, the rice noodles were badly overcooked, and the chicken was tough and flavorless.  The green curry was a bit better, for the dish at least had a nice curry flavor.  Unfortunately, the vegetables in the dish were few and far between and very poorly cooked.  There was also more of the tough, flavorless chicken.  (Clearly, chicken is not the protein to order at Thai Marlai.)"}
{"text":"Just wonderful. I thought upon entering it might not be very good as I did not see any Thai workers, but I was pleasantly surprised. Coming from NY/CT we know out Thai. The wonton soup was amazing, the menu throws you off as it says it for two but it is not. Wonderful taste. Then I had thought I ordered vegetable Pad Thai and when it can out with chicken they were so nice to change it. I think it might have been my error. Well it was great. Could have used some lime but I will bring my own. The have saki, so that was great. My partner has the duck and he said they duck could have been better but loved his tum yong soup. I would go again, the bill was even reasonable . The place could use a painting but it is what it is. The staff was very nice. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Ever since moving away from New York we've been trying to find a Thai restaurant that would fill the void left behind by Blue Spice in Albany. That place gave us high expectations of what Thai food should be, and I never thought we would find a place as good. What we did find was Thai Marlai, and while it does not quite live up to our spoiled expectations, it's pretty darn close.

Thai Marlai is located in a strip mall type area behind the awesome Sushi at the Lake in Cornelius, and next to a Blockbuster (I had no idea they still had brick and mortar stores!) When we stepped inside we were immediately greeted and seated by friendly staff. The interior is small and cozy, and despite the limited seating and decent crowd inside it was still quiet. 

We started with a round of Thai iced tea ($2.95) which is an unsweet tea with cream and some kind of Thai spices. What you get is a sweet/savory drink that can't be beat. I might have went for a beer instead but there is no beer or wine menu, so I wasn't totally sure if they offered it (though I later saw other tables drinking both.) For an appetizer we split an order of spring rolls ($7.95), and they were pretty decent. They are small and thin, so I think they soaked up the oil a lot more than a larger spring roll would have. There also wasn't too much filling inside, which I think also contributed to the too much oil flavor. 

Now I'm a huge fan of duck, especially in Thai dishes. I was pleased to see there were quite a few duck dishes here and I opted for the Ped Num Prig Pow ($17.95). This dish was excellent, and lived up to the Blue Spice Duck dish I left behind in Albany. They bring out a HUGE platter that is overflowing with duck, peppers, onions, green onion, carrots, and other veggies, and it's all covered in this wonderful sauce. They also give you an empty dish so you can ladle what you want into it. They are generous with the amount of duck meat, and there was literally enough for me to save for two meals, which almost never happens. The duck is served nice and crispy, and I just loved biting into those crunchy, wonderful hunks of meat. The veggies were all really good as well, and the sauce was mildly spicy with just enough heat to give a bit of warmth to my lips. The dish also comes with a large bowl of white rice which I mixed in with the other food to make an awesome meal.

The missus went with her Thai go-to, the Pad Thai ($14.95). She really enjoyed it, and I also enjoyed the few bites I stole from her. It's a great Thai staple for those unaccustomed to the cuisine, and it wasn't spicy at all. Like my duck, the Pad Thai is a ginormous portion that is easily good for two-three dinners. 

If you are jonesing for some Thai in the Lake Norman area, I highly recommend checking out Thai Marlai. The food is excellent, the staff is super friendly and it is just an overall comfortable eating environment. We will definitely be coming back here!"}
