{"text":"First let me say I love this restaurant! The food is great and the atmosphere is nice and relaxing. 
However, the service is always slow! The server is great and always on the move. They are just short staffed (maybe in the kitchen too?) Last 3 times I've been there has only been one server. Not his fault, he is working hard to get to all the tables and getting the food out in a timely manner. 

Please hire more staff, having to wait 2 hours for dinner is not fun."}
{"text":"Originally came here for a private work party a few years ago. We had the whole place booked out and enjoyed the food a lot. Decided to come back for a birthday dinner but was disappointed. I ordered the lamb and it was still delicious, however, service was lacking. The stewardess completed ignored our existence even though she walked past us several times. I didn't expect her to seat us right away but to at least acknowledge the fact that we were there would've been nice. It might've been a busy evening hence the service was not up to par - not too sure."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, atmosphere.  Had the lobster Mac & Cheese-fantastic.   Excellent menu options, a must go to"}
{"text":"Spent a great deal of time here over the holidays. Excellent service and amazing quality food.  This is a wonderful find for newmarket.   You won't be disappointed!  Thank you for a good quality ristorante with a beautiful ambiance!"}
{"text":"Last night in Newmarket, July 23, 2016, brought the inlaws, spouse and sister-in-law.  The hotel concierge said she hadn't been there,  so please report back.  We arrived at 7:00 and were seated after approximately 5 minutes, nice atmosphere, but I did notice two large parties in the dining room.  We ordered drinks and a bruesetta, the drinks were delivered and we ordered our dinner at 7:04.  The bruesetta was delivered after a few minutes and while a littel heavy on the garlic, okay...   At approximately 7:45, the waitress informed us that the larger parties had backed up the kitchen, and our dinners would be coming out in 5-10 minutes.  By now the in-laws, in their 80's had just about had it.  I asked the waitress to speak with the manager, she said she would.  After another 15 minutes, the three meals were delivered and followed shortly by the two pizzas.  The mother-in-laws pizza was cold, soggy and basically tasted terrible, the father-in-laws pizza was a little better, at least edible.  My sister-in-laws goat cheese ravioli's were pretty good and the wifes penne with sauce could have been better if they had just opened a jar of Ragu.  My dinner was spagetti with italian sausage, it tasted pretty good, but after an hour and a half wait, just about anything would have tasted good.  As soon as I finished it, we requested the check, and along with the check came the manager, who said, \"well, we prepare everything when ordered, and those two tables did back up the kitchen so nothing we could do about it.\"  The worst part is, the waitress was very nice, but because of the terrible food, backup in the kitchen and the managers' lack of judgement to say something like, \"hey really sorry about the wait, the bruesetta's on the house or pick out one dessert,\" the tip was minimal.  I told the concierge at the hotel, I would not recommend this restaruant and she was more empathetic than the restaruant manager.  Should have checked Jeffery's review prior to picking this place."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is not worth the price. Owner and employees are rude and distasteful. Food came out cold and late. Chairs are unstable and you can hear the kitchen yelling at the waitstaff. Absolutely disappointed and disgusted. How did anyone give this place a good rating to begin with? Better off dining at A&W across the street!"}
{"text":"First time visit last night but it won't be our last. From the bread and dipping oils, warm pear salad, my trout with strawberry balsamic reduction, my husbands beef short rib meal and then homemade sorbet for dessert everything was sooo good and beautifully presented. Excellent waiter who was great but not over attentive. Lots of variety on their menu."}
{"text":"Good Italian can be hard to find, especially when restaurants claim \"fine dining\".  They better have some serious game to back the claim or it's negative fame!

Spero is in the same mall as my nearly daily stop at Tea Hotea.  Weave in between Cynthias, and Mandarin, and you find Spero a few doors down from Cora's.  Spero is fairly elegant, worthy of a date night.  The service, table linens and ambiance all work.  This night, the place was fairly empty, so the wait staff was extra attentive.

I ordered one of my usuals--Veal Scaloppine al Marsala. As hoped, it was tender, flavourful, with a great sauce and delicious mushrooms.  My date had the Gnocchi Con Asiago.  I was able to scam a taste, and it had to be the most melt-in-your-mouth Gnocchi I have ever tasted.

As usual for any Italian restaurant I visit, I left stuffed.  My wallet--not so much!  But this is probably on of the best Italian restaurants in Newmarket, so I can't complain!"}
{"text":"False advertising. Walked in well before 9pm on a Tuesday, despite being open till 10:00 the hostess/waitress had to check if the kitchen was  still open. For real??? Apparently customer service is not a priority. The kitchen staff want to clean up early and get paid for the last hour despite not working. My brother and I stood waiting for a couple minutes and left. Even if we were seated, we feared sub-par quality and getting spit in our food. Maybe their food was good but I wouldn't know...based on this experience I will not be going back as a matter of principle."}
