{"text":"If you're anywhere near the puritas area make sure you stop by. This place has great food and good service. The portions are just right and taste is on point! Don't be afraid of the decor it make look like a bad place to stop but DON'T BE FOOLED!"}
{"text":"Easy spot to find and the owner is a real good dude. I ordered am full slab and fries. Wanted a side of Mac and cheese but he had just run out. Maybe a testament to how good it is? But the ribs were great! The sauce was subtle, the near was nice and tender, and whatever they were marinated in was unreal. I will definitely be back for more and to try that mac"}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and were impressed with the good reviews. When we pulled up we were a bit sketched out by the exterior. Don't judge a book by its cover. This is more of a \"to go\" place as there is only one table. The ribs rell off the bone and melts in your mouth. The collard greens were excellent and so was the mac and cheese. Im so glad we decided to order from them. The employees were so friendly and helped us order. I live far away but I will be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"\" Ribs were swimming in 12oz. of sauce\" I had high hopes for the no frills, take out atmosphere of Al & B's BBQ. As I pulled up to the shop with a smoker being tended to the right of the front door. I walked up to the window and was greeted by a polite staff. I ordered and in 10 min. had a heavy bag of food. The polish boy sausage sandwich was good and a good value. However it was downhill from there. The beans were right out of a campbells can and the slaw was bland. At $3 a side I thought it would be shareable, but is was only enough for one. Word of all was the Ribs swimming in 12oz. of sauce, this had the effect of hiding any smoky rib flavor. But did not tenderize the chewy tough meat."}
{"text":"YUMMY!! Got ribs and Mac and cheese!! Great price for what you get- is it a little \"shady\" looking...yes...but the guy is really nice- and good food- look past the front entrance and front room-"}
{"text":"We had the polish boy sandwiches and they're really good but very messy. Their sauce is really very tasty! It. Should be sold as a beverage!!!! I wish they had ribtips, tho."}
{"text":"The sauce is great, everything else was just fair. Had ribs, a polish boy, slaw, and mac and cheese. It's located in a nondescript area of the city and it always smells really good, so I truly thought I'd find a gem. The interior needs some love; peeling paint, duct tape holding things together, needs a good scrubbing. The guy who took our takeout order was neither kind nor mean, -Just very business as usual. The prices were average. Again, all in all this was just Meh."}
{"text":"Just good old fashioned food...I had the full slab of ribs (more than I could eat, and I LOVE ribs) with fries so-so and slaw...pretty good. And a side of collard greens -- fantastic!  cost about $22 bucks.  Not bad.  The ribs were a bit chewy, tho not enough to gripe about. The thick, sweet sauce had a hint of spice -- at times, more than a hint. But overall, very good.  and as other reviewers have pointed out, the place ain't great looking from the outside.  But so what?  Go in...order...wait a few minutes and then take home some of the best barbecue ever.  You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"This place is nothing to look at, but it is a place to run to. Holy S!! The ribs were awesome.  Tremendous!  Take some advice. TAKE-OUT!!!"}
{"text":"Best Polish Boy in Town this place make sandwiches like my Mother. Like I've said 5*from me."}
{"text":"This was not that good.  Dive place and no selection sometimes means great food. Not here.    I walked over from the Marroitt to try the ribs since I love good ribs.  They were too fatty and unevenly cooked and not that good at all though the sauce was good.  Fries were horrible.   Will not eat these again.   Do take out if you try these"}
{"text":"I went here one day on my lunch break and didn't know what to expect. I got the Polish Boy, 2 wings with sauce and a side of fries. The food was slamming!!! I was all done and realized I wanted more. I'm big on the BBQ spots in the area and this one is definitely up there. On top of that the prices are pretty low compared to a couple other BBQ spots in the area. Will definitely be returning soon"}
{"text":"Just go! Review on food only, I don't care about the duct tape on the door. I like duct tape. My first bite was the fries. They had sauce on them. Delicious.  Then ribs. Awesome. Then wings. Tempura fried with BBQ sauce. You can buy them by the wing for .90 cents each. I was sad I did not order more. Just Go for take out."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! BBQ sauce...best in CLE. Ordered hard fried wings, 1/2 slab ribs ( you can taste the smokiness), 2 Polish boys, 1 Polish girl,  LG greens, and mac. Everything was so fresh and flavor full."}
{"text":"On a business trip, had ribs here one night and amy first Polish Boy for lunch the next day with a side of Greens.  Everything  was outstanding.  A little challenging eating the Polish Boy in a jacket and tie but worth the effort.  Take out is the way to go. There are a couple of tables and chairs, but this is your classic hole in the wall with amazing good BBQ."}
{"text":"The Polish Girl i had for lunch was so good that I want to swing by to grab another one for dinner! Highly recommend this place. Will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were just passing by Cleveland and saw this place on Yelp.   Long story short: we had 2 polish boys and a Polish girl with beans and Mac and cheese and couldn't be happier! Delicious!! Incredible!!!! Also, the people here is awesome and it's really cheap. If we lived here we'd order every week!  It was so good that we forgot to take a picture hahaha"}
{"text":"Al & B's is located in the old location of Sirus Pizza.Dont expect to find all kinds of neat décor because this is a HOOD BBQ joint but its very good.I had a rib dinner with peach cobbler and it ran me a total of 12 bucks.The food comes out hot and the meat isn't drenched in sauce.The service is good so yall go out and give Al & B's a try."}
{"text":"This place is the best bbq joint on the west side. Unless you live on the east side I dunno why you would go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed. I love barbecue and went there because it was recommended. Got there and the place is abandoned. If I they're still in business you wouldn't know it."}
{"text":"Much like the other reviews indicate, Al & B's is a no-frills operation. Please don't confuse \"hood\" with dangerous or dirty. The establishment was clean and the gentlemen working there were kind and friendly. They are located in an older strip mall that I would normally drive right past but I'm glad we stopped in to pick up dinner.  The prices were reasonable. We spent about $25 for 2 rib dinners and 2 slices of cake for dessert. The food was very tasty. You will use the white bread included with your order to sop up the sauce because it's delicious. The meat was falling off the bone, very tender and had a great smoky flavor.   In a city where good barbeque is hard to find Al & B's does it the right way. This local business was worth the try and we'll be back for more."}
{"text":"The place on the West side for Polish boys. Wonderful, cheap, great service. Pork shoulder is also phenomenal."}
{"text":"Who knew ahat Al Sharpton and Beyoncé opened a place together. And yet, here it is. Al & Bey's.  What to get: A Polish Boy. What not to get: Rabies from a Polish boy in the alley behind the restaurant after he bites you. What never to get: Married to a Polish boy. Why: Just kidding Polish boys. I'm sure you war saw what I did there. I'm posnantive you found it funny. Now let's krakowpen a bottle of bubbly. Shall we? I knew I wouldn't have to ask you kato-twice.  If you're driving West on X, then look to the left, to the left. Every Polish Boy you want in this shop to the left. A Polish Boy is a Cleveland invention, and a damn good one. It's a luscious, dripping wet Polish sausage on a bun with French fries, Coleslaw and BBQ sauce all on it... and possibly some more crazy ingredients I'm unaware of as I'm scoffing it down. It's a must try when in Cleveland.  I'm Crazy In Love with their Polish Boys. Al & B serve up a wonderfully tasty, hearty, piping hot, excellent Polish boy, somewhat similar to Hot Sauce Williams, but somewhat superior as well. It's probably second only to SETI's which is a truck which makes the very best Polish Boys.   They don't sell Lemonade, but they do have pretty long lines so you may have to get in Formation. The prices here are absolutely amazing. The decor is nothing to shout about, it's run down and there is really nowhere to eat, but when the products taste this wonderful, who cares. You will not believe how cheaply you can buy rib dinners and the like from here. I will try the ribs and such next time.  Make sure you try this Polish Boy. You will end up Drunk In Love with it."}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious!! This place is a small hole-in-the-wall type with about 6 small tables to eat at. The men who were working when we went in were total sweethearts. The food was absolutely fantastic. We tried the Polish Boy, Polish Girl, wings, and Mac and cheese. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"easy to drive by. not much to look at, but the food is great. I call ahead for faster service."}
{"text":"Umm...when are they open? Just stopped by to grab some of this chicken that was being raved about...not a car in sight. Lights off...does not look open for business? What a waste."}
{"text":"Pretty good smoke and sauce.  It was a little over done in spots, based on meat tenderness expectations of smoked spare ribs.  I was there kind of late on Friday for carry-out.  Slaw was a little sweet, but based on differing tastes this place was pretty satisfying.  Also generous portions of fries with the full slab and added greens.  Sauce was mustard style and generously applied to both ribs and fries. Interesting flavors and I liked it very much (twice).  Promise to try again and let Al & B earn that coveted 4th star, but this place is a safe bet for satisfying your craving for smoked meats and the stuff that comes with it.  Full slab comes with 3 slices of very soft white bread.  I would suggest a cornbread option, but I am guessing Al & B is trying to keep things simple here.  It is a good start and encouraging for growth. If Al & B do try cornbread, I would suggest keeping it moist."}
{"text":"Tonite I stopped and picked up 2 \"POLISH GIRL\" sandwiches.  The store could use a lot of work, but the food was great.  The sausage was crisp with a hint of heat,  the sauce was sweet & tangy, the pork had a nice smoke to it. The slaw & fries were standard fair.  Wanted to try the mac & cheese but it was still baking.  Will definitely be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I got there and there was a sign in the window that said back at 2 pm.  It was 7.  Drove into the parking lot at the same time as someone else... They said that the food was GREAT... if you could find someone there.  I look forward to trying it. Some day.  If I'm in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"The gentleman who operates this BBQ is super nice. The food is great! From the chicken and fries, to the ribs, to the side dishes. You will want to come back and try this westside BBQ location.Please do not allow the look of the location deture your for coming. The food is goood. My favorite. ...the Polish Boy."}
{"text":"Great barbecue!! Anyone who has tried recently and it has looked abandoned. Fear no more, looks like there was an incident that occurred where the front of house was damaged. They closed for a bit to get repairs done. Happy to say they are back in business and still serving great food.   I am used to some good down south Texas barbecue so when I initially read the reviews I was excited. Something even close to that here in Cleveland would be great. I was definitely not let down.  Their tempura fried wings are great. Have ordered dozens at a time. Paired with the sauce, hands down great stuff. Ribs are pretty good too. Cooked well and great smokey flavor. Not as tender as Texas but darn close. I worked in a barbecue spot while living in Texas and this place does pretty well to bring me back.   Don't let the decor sway. It's a simple place that provides what you want. No extra frills. Go in, order and take out. Can't complain at all about that.   Good portions with soft bread provided. Fries are great when fresh. They offer the option to smoother them in sauce as well which I enjoy. Very tangy spicy zing to it that makes it stand out from the other places in the area or city that offer the similar fare.   Definitely would recommend giving this place a try if you are craving some barbecue. I've visited and heard folks traveling from far just to eat here. It's one of the few places that I enjoy visiting every once in awhile. Not one of those places you try, enjoy and then really never feel like going back to. That says a lot!"}
{"text":"Got fries with sauce, mac and cheese, a Polish Boy and a shoulder sammich with coleslaw. Everything was amazing. Meat tender, sausage crisp and juicy, coleslaw fresh, and sauce was bangin'. Service was great, too. I'll be back soon (and often)."}
{"text":"I ordered the wing special and polish boy. The wings were cooked perfectly and sauced just right. The sauce had a flavorful tang. The all beef polish boy was very delicious as well."}
{"text":"I just searched here for BBQ & had to try them so I decided on the Polish Girl & oh my was it one of the best around town, better than Hot Sauce Williams & Beckham B&M..."}
{"text":"I stopped in today and ordered a full slab of ribs. I'll definitely be back. Excellent sauce and the meat falls off the bone. It's not fancy, but that what's great about it. As I entered, they had a smoker running out front. The smell was awesome.    This place is located near the SW corner of Puritas and W. 150th in a small old strip mall. It's nothing special to look at, but don't judge it by the cover.   I talked to the owner (at least I think it was gthe owner) and he told me he's there 7 days a week till 10pm during the week and 'till midnight on weekends.    Yes, you can go to Famous Daves or whatever \"chain\" you're comfortable with, but this is the real deal. Ill be back!"}
{"text":"I finally stopped in after months of passing this locale and people telling me to check it out. The shop is really bare bones- no tables. I was in a hurry and ribs wouldn't be ready for 30 minutes, so I settle for a Polish Boy and a side of mac and cheese. The guy was really nice and thanked me for coming in. As I was leaving, (with only $7 less in my pocket, btw) he slipped a menu in my bag and said 'Just in case you like what you ordered'.  Just in case?  I laughed later. Because he knew. SO DELICIOUS.  The frank was cooked perfect- nice and meaty, just enough salty smoky flavor. Topped with some fresh fries and a delicious coleslaw. What really changed everything was the sauce. It was tangy and vinegary, but not watery. Somehow, even after driving my food home, the bun wasn't soggy.  This was such a glorious mess and it was worth it. I will probably never eat this in front of anyone- I must have looked like a starved coyote scarfing this thing down.  Mac and Cheese was good- a little drier than I would like my mac and cheese, but the flavor was good.  I will definitely be back. often."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been big fans of this place before he was located on Puritas. Al's food is delicious and he has the best sauce I've ever tasted. His prices are reasonable and he has a lot of good options on his menu. Don't be scared away from this place thinking it has a \"hood\" appearance. It's a wonderful business and Al is a great guy. It's awesome - try it!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was epic - a little hole in the wall that didn't look like much from the outside.  Glad we went in and gave the place a chance, because they were some of the best ribs I've ever eaten. Mac and cheese was rich and wonderful and flavorful too."}
{"text":"Definitely get the wings!!!! So so good!! Like everyone said, decor is scary, but don't let it stop you! We swung past and saw the yelp reviews and had to stop. Glad we did! My three kids (9, 7 and 5) all loved it! My 7-yr old had the rib sandwich and ate it faster than I could eat one! My other two devoured the wings! Stop by and say hi to Al!"}
{"text":"This place is a real hidden gem the food is by far the best soul food and is great home cooking. Ribs are delicious and the sauce is too die for and the Cole slaw no lie is the best I've ever had. Crispy chicken wings and Mac n cheese is moist as ever . I'm so glad I live down the street I could go here everyday! Owner is really laid back and nice as well"}
