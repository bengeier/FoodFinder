{"text":"So it seems like change is coming to Kramer's.

I don't know if all the bad reviews from 2009 were an indication of a different manager; but my recent experiences at Kramer's in May 2011 have been positive overall.

The roof-top patio is an amazing spot to read a book or just chat with friends over beer. The Spaghetti and Meatballs, the Chicken curry and the sweet potato fries are right on key.

Wait-staff can be slightly inattentive but they never get anything wrong.

Good place, reasonable prices, an hopping when a game is on (especially if its Aussie football)."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and have enjoyed myself. Since it's been \"under new management\" the menu has gotten much more extensive and expensive. Soup is overpriced and bland. A white soup in a white bowl with no garnish just looks unappetizing. A pinch of parsley would do wonders. The wings are usually pretty good and the selection of beer is also pretty good. For some reason the last few times I've been there I was attacked by fruit flies that just wont go away."}
{"text":"service was terrible.  one person doing bar and serving tables.  everything was slow, it took an hour to get our food.  it came out in stages.  people that got theirs first were treated to burnt fries.  the poutine looked like it had been sitting under the heat lamp for awhile.  

under new management?  they need to figure out their staffing issues.

lots of other options in the area, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, pleasant service, disappointing food. 

Lunch took a long time to come out. The veggie spring rolls had an unbalanced flavor & it seemed quiet possible that they had come out of a box. Caesar salad is hard to mess up, but here it was bitter and unpleasant. 
The fish on the grilled salmon salad had a nice set of grill marks, but the mango was very under ripe. 

The rooftop patio wasn't open for lunch. I can imagine that it must be a nice space for a couple of after work drinks. I wouldn't ever try to eat here again though."}
{"text":"Kramer's is your typical neighbourhood pub, it has a nice patio, karaoke on the weekends and a menu filled with typical greasy finger foods. They are good for an afternoon/early evening drink but the service is pretty slow so if you are looking to eat I suggest trying the Firkin down the st. A group of friends and I went on a tuesday night, and our service was horrible. It was completely dead in there, and it took us over 15 mins to get our drinks(one of which came with a lemon that had some sort of red substance all over it), and another 30-45 after that to even order food. For a busy place I can expect somewhat delayed service like this, however there couldn't have been more than 10 of us in the entire restaurant. The food when we finally got it, came out cold and tasted just mediocre. All in all I'd say Kramer's is good if you want to chill and have a beer but not the best place to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Their perogies were decent, but there weren't enough of them. Relaxed atmosphere, friendly service. Free wi-fi."}
{"text":"I go here for trivia night every week. A fun local Neighborhood bar that hasn't lost it's charm after it's renos and upgrades. A decent selection of beers and the new menu is great."}
{"text":"Very slow service especially during lunch, probably because they could use more staff.  The food is typical burgers, fries, wraps, etc.  Nothing special.  I suggest the omelets for lunch.  They are huge and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"For my birthday I booked a table here for 10 people almost a month in advance. The day of the party, I called them to make sure everything was taken care of and to add a few more people to my reservation. They said it was no problem. 

Fifteen minutes before we arrived at the restaurant, Kramer's called me and cancelled because Kramer's was undergoing construction. It was very unprofessional and I was forced to make last minute plans for 14 people on a Saturday night.

Fortunately, one of my favourite bars, Alley Katz, was able to accommodate us and we had an awesome time there!"}
{"text":"My new local! Tried other bars in the neighbourhood but they had no personality. This bar (while a strange crowd for some) was super fun and welcoming. I have yet to try the food since I've become a late night regular but I always have a good time, live music on Sundays is a bonus! Especially because Scully is fantastic. The prices are decent and they do some great specials. If you're in the neighbourhood just go."}
{"text":"I don't know why I like this place - maybe because it's one of the very few midtown bars that isn't pretentious. It is what it is (a neighbourhood pub). Do you like your staff perky, slinky and long-legged? Don't come here. Want the latest microbrew? Try down the street. How about today's specials? Sorry, there aren't any. Hip ambience or the feeling you're in Olde London town? That's four doors down. Washrooms with designer fixtures? Uh, no... But their attitude is great - when they started serving Molson Export on tap their sandwich board outside said \"Ex on Tap...Seriously\". The food is very, very good at reasonable prices, the manager knows what he's doing, Sean behind the bar runs a great shop, the beer is cold and it won't empty your wallet. And it's the type of place where anyone can relax, feel welcome and not rushed."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in quite some time. Used to go quite a bit but after some management changes, bad food and bad service (the bar tender guy is really good but  there were a number of young waitresses that were angry or slow most of the time) we decided that we may as well just go to Fionns down the road for better service and cheaper beer.

Decided to give Kramers another chance after overhearing it was again under new management. Arrived and sat down under some extremely bright new interrogation lighting and waited for awhile to be served. There was a private party upstairs and the staff were all scrambling to clean and set up while some of the party members sat waiting. Upon finally getting the menu and seeing the staff, we realized it wasn't under new management. Uh oh.

I was craving nachos so ordered the nachos with meat. They come with two types of cheese, lime pulled pork, peppers and jalapeños with guacamole, sour cream and salsa on the side. Well when they arrived it had to be the most depressing nachos I have ever seen. Hardly any cheese, a few sparse sprinklings of pulled pork and a few rings of jalapeños and all for $15!!!! Completely not worth that amount if money.

My fiancé ordered the spaghetti bolognese, the sauce was so full if rosemary that it completely overpowered the dish, the salad was overdressed (brought back memories of our overdressed Caesar salad last fall) and they forgot the garlic bread.

Too bad, we tried again and won't be going back. I think the place needs to be gutted, completely redecorated, lose the karaoke crowd and go for something new and updated. It's a great space with a great upstairs patio in the summer but they need to go back to a decent menu that offers value and good food."}
{"text":"I used to go for brunch quite often before becoming completely sick of the service. I often waited 15mins just to get my bill while it was nowhere near busy. Food was usually fine, but for brunch if it's not quick and pleasant what's the point. I can make bacon and eggs at home just fine."}
{"text":"Staff are cold and unfriendly. too many drunks and food is crap"}
{"text":"I have been here dozen or so times for a beer and grab some food half a dozen times. 

Lime and Pepper Wings, are a class above the rest of the neighbourhood wing joints. Baby Pork Back Rib special is greatness and the portions are massive, sides perfect. Note Wings and Ribs are easily my go to foods every time im out and a few beers down. But last night I decided to try the Lime Marinated Pulled Pork Nachoes. I was in heaven, practically licking the tray clean.

Kramers is definitely now my favourite pub and grub stop in the Davisville and Eglinton areas."}
{"text":"A meal at Kramer's is a bit like Russian Roulette.

Will the server be in a terrible mood? Will my food take half an hour or longer to be served? Or, will everything go smoothly?

Living in the neighbourhood, I have been to Kramer's for cheap nachos and a pitcher on game night, but mostly I'm there for the brunch.

The brunch menu is extensive and sure to please everyone. The prices reflect what you'd expect from the Yonge and Eglinton area, so even though the spot may look like a cheap bet, you'll be disappointed here. However, the value for your dollar is pretty good, on a good day.

The Eggs Jenny, a twist on eggs benedict where the english muffin is swapped for crab cakes is always great. The cakes change size and consistency, but never let us down. 

The skillets are served piping hot, but the combination of fresh ingredients and unique combinations are typically a great choice. The basic breakfasts aren't anything out of the ordinary so I suggest spending a few extra bucks for their more unique options.

The coffee is terrible. There's just no getting around this, it's just bad, but I'm addicted to the stuff in general, so even bad coffee is better than no coffee at all.

Service can be spotty here. The servers on a good day are attentive, patient and pleasant. On a bad day they're huddled at the end of the bar and hard to approach. The good days do outnumber the bad days, but again, it's hit and miss.

While the restaurant is rarely full, the two patios are great for their location and on karaoke nights the place seems like the local bar it should be."}
{"text":"been here a few times for lunch with friends from work. Friendly bartender, the crowd it attracts however is questionable to say the least. Menu is nothing to rave about, and usually not very many ppl inside. but the location is great. i have yet to see it in the summer."}
{"text":"Alrighty, I can scramble eggs half-heartedly and throw them on a plate.
+ some overcooked bacon.
Maybe I should start a breakfast service too.
All I need is a restaurant that is a cross between a run-down sports bar and pub."}
{"text":"I chose this place initially because of the patio to hold our meetup.  I received a DM from a friend of mine mentioning that the bar was closed until 7 PM.  I had to call to make sure even my reservation was happening.  So they waitress had said that they mentioned to me that there was new ownership and there would be an inspection going on.  UH NO YOU DIDN'T.  

The bar was quite empty, the menu was still being generated with minimal items on the current menu.  The patio door was open even though it was about 12C last night.  They promptly shut it after about 45 minutes.  

The new waitress spilled some of the Strongbow on my pants and jacket.  All I got was a sorry instead of owning responsibility and saying the next one is on us.  

The group ordered nachos and it was very small.  We ordered two sets and could barely feed 6 people.  Looking at my friend's order of fish and chips, they looked burned.  The only thing good was the choice of alcoholic beverages.  

Then came the karaoke.  The speakers were right at the back of the bar where we were sitting.  It was very loud and we decided to leave.  Some of us left for the night and others went to the Twisted Kilt.  

This place is horrible and I will never suggest this place to anyone else.  I should have listened to the Yelpers on this one."}
{"text":"Came here for trivia night. Made reservations which is highly recommended. They do separate bills for groups. There was no craft beer available, but they did have Stella for $6. No complaints about that. We ordered food and it arrived in a decent amount of time, even though the place was packed. They kept our glasses full!

Trivia was ok. More for a much older crowd. We barely got half of them right! 

I had a Kramer Burger. It was OK. Not a lot of flavour, pretty blah. Fries were cold. Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"I came to Kramer's with a large group of people and we had a really good time. On Saturday they have karaoke and it's a really fun time. I sang a song and everyone cheered for me after and were giving me high fives. The environment is fun and supportive. 

The crowd is older, which is really nice if you're in your late twenties, thirties or forties. The waitress was also really great. She was tending to all of her customers extremely well.

This place looks small from the outside but is much bigger once in. It's not huge but it's a good size. 

I would definitely go back for another karaoke night. :)"}
{"text":"Kramer's is located near the north east corner of Davisville and Yonge pretty much on the opposite corner of Davisville station and the TTC headquarters.

I went with a bunch a friends to Kramer's on a Wednesday for a trivia night that was going to start around 7pm.  I arrived around 630 and was able to put my order in for a pitcher and fish and chips for dinner.  The place is not that big but the right size to have about 9 teams of 6 or so participate in a little competition.   Our group had two tables at the back and we were packed pretty tight but it was comfortable enough.  

The food arrived and was good.  It wasn't the best fish and chips I've ever had but it was filling enough and it was a somewhat generous serving.  I'm a big guy and although I finished the entire thing I wasn't really left wanting.  The fish was cut thick and the batter wasn't necessarily hard or crispy but it was tasty and filling.  

As far as the trivia went the questions were well spread out as far as history, science, sports, etc.  The music section is always a challenge since if you don't have somebody that knows a lot of music trivia you can sadly fall behind in the points race.  Sadly for us that was the case this time around.

I liked the service here and while it's understandable that when the game's going on people are concentrating, the servers seem to respect that and still manage to keep glasses filled bus the tables accordingly so we had room to play the game (share reading the sheets etc.).

I liked the fact that even though we were two tables of 5 or 6 each that we were all able to get separate bills.  Nothing gets more confusing than when some places won't do that."}
{"text":"Went here with a date. The crowd was definitely older than us, around 35-60, but maybe that's why it has a very low-key and chill atmosphere. The servers were very nice, often coming by to ask if we wanted another round or just give us more water. They were promoting a ginger beer and kept coming by with free samples of it, which is very unexpected and welcome ;)
We only ordered yam fries, we were mostly there to drink, but I really enjoyed the fries. For the price you're paying (the usual of $7) you get a entree sized bowlful!! The only improvement needed to the dish is another side of the sauce. There's only enough for half the fries.. How are you supposed to eat the rest??? Another thing to note is that they had an open karaoke event. Now I was there on Friday night, and I'm not sure if this happens every week or more than one night of the week, but if that's something you're interested in, this place is a nice option. The level of skill varied among the singers but the crowd was very supportive, which is always a good sign!

Takeaway: I would go back. There was more on the menu that I would like to try out and just seemed like a chill bar/pub to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I met friends here for a late dinner and drinks. The location is excellent. Right across from the subway station. I got the macaroni and cheese. It was like $14 and crazy-cheesy with mushrooms and bacon, served with a salad and crostini. Aside from being delicious it was served in a cute little cast iron skillet and came out of the kitchen in about 10 minutes. They have a fairly good beer list for such a small place. I did a lot of cheap PBR at $5 a pint and a long island iced tea for dessert which was well made. Karaoke starts at 10 pm on Fridays and Saturdays. The rotation was quick allowing us to get on stage more often than our usual haunts. The locals were friendly. Song selection was great. I think I'll go back. Four stars because I have no complaints but it also wasn't a mind-blowing experience."}
{"text":"I'll have to agree with the category Kramers was put in - DIve Bar. Its not a \"cool\" dive bar that people tend to flock too, but the kind of dive bar you should stay away from.
I just had lunch there, and even though the place was 96% empty, my food took too long to arrive. Maybe 20 minutes for a Burger & Fries?? What's up with that? The Burger was OK, the waitress was friendly, but not friendly enough to point out that the kitchen had mad a mistake.
There have been a couple changes in ownership as the previous Yelper explains. Maybe the next owner might decide to make this place a bit better.....and name it ummmm Jerry's?"}
{"text":"I'll start by agreeing with a previous reviewer's comment \"I have no idea why this place got so many bad reviews!\". I had been there a few times early in the year to watch a Raptors game and a CFL game, and it seemed like a nice enough place for a few drinks or some pub fare. It is rather low key, not really a sports bar, and definitely seems a more middle-aged neighbourhood crowd. The service is as expected, the bartender chats with the regulars, but is always around for refills or a food order. Apparently, there is also a lounge/party room upstairs which I never noticed before.

So for Labour Day, I dropped in to have the Monday $10 Chicken Parmesan special, and it was very good. The chicken was well-cooked, lots of cheese and tomato sauce, all on a nicely toasted bun with lots of fries on the side. Monday also features $4 rail drinks, so is a good day for me to go. Most days they have a $10 food special and some kind of drink special. I had the Sunday wing special when I went for the CFL game, and the wings were okay, but the chicken parmesan was much better.

Total for dinner and 3 drinks was $25, so that's a great deal.  And as an added bonus, I bought some excellent fruits at the grocery next door as I left. I can definitely see myself going back for upcoming Sunday/Monday night NFL games."}
{"text":"Me and my friend saw this bar and decided to sit in and have a pint while waiting for one of our other friends. We thought we would only be there for an hour or so but we ended up staying for over 2 hours. The ambiance was nice and relaxed and the service was amazing. The prices were great and cheap for beer and the food was pretty good. All in all its a good place to go for a beer with good friends and good times."}
{"text":"Yonge/Davisville area (parking lot beside the bar or street parking), I came here for trivia night.  I believe they do it on Wednesday's but check the website for specifics.

It was packed!  I guess people love their trivia!  Not particularly hungry I shared some apps with my friend - calamari (not bad for a pub actually).  Luckily they can do separate bills - for big groups like there were at trivia night that is amazing! 

The trivia isn't particularly themed (ie - not a Friend's or Seinfeld edition), but moreover history, sports, entertainment, music, etc type of questions.  They do skew on older knowledge so if you are younger you might have problems answering the questions.

For the record my team did not come in last - we came in 2nd last!  There should be a prize for that ;)"}
{"text":"Worst service from the weekend bartender/server. All
That was wanted was some sweet potato fries and he claims none after seeing me. However at a later visit he served my colleagues at a later time. This occurred on numerous occasions over the weekend. Why is it when I come here on the weekdays I can get that particular order, with any other server...just not the weekend server? What would be the reasoning behind that? It makes me and my colleagues wonder."}
{"text":"Kramers is a fun spot in my neighborhood and I've had a good time every time I've been. Would be nice if they expanded their draught beer selection, but it's not a bad line up. 

Last time I went was for their trivia night on a Wednesday. Lots of fun and great variety of questions, including some music trivia. Biggest downside to the trivia nights is the cheaters. Yes, table of losers beside me, I can see you \"Shazam-ing\" the songs on your iPhone under the table!! Pathetic. I'd rather lose honestly than win by cheating, but it's still discouraging when people cheat. Not the fault of the bar, because there's always going to be those people who don't play by the rules. Oh well. 

The service can be slow at times, but it's still good service. Food wise, I've only had their signature burger, which was awesome. Can't go wrong with bacon and cheese!!"}
{"text":"With most pubs in Toronto being Irish themed and each one being a knock off of the next, I think it's refreshing to find a pub called 'Kramers'. I dig the name. Not quite sure where the origins of it are but it's nice to find something a bit more original than the usual copycats. 

The bar itself is merely alright. Overall it's a decent enough place to sit down for a drink. It's location is just far enough from Yonge and Eg to avoid totally inflated food and bar prices, although Davisville isn't exactly skid row so prices remain what I'd deem as average. The main bar area is laid out in a way that tells me not a lot of thought went into it. Again, it's not terrible but it's very hot-hum. If you weren't aware, you can easily miss the fact that there is an upstairs part to the bar. It's a little more unique but again it's nothing special and doesn't really have a ton of ambiance.

The food also lacks any special quality to it. I ordered a Kramers Burger which is basically a bacon cheeseburger. The bacon was cooked perfectly as was the burger. Some nice crisp cheddar adorned the top of the burger and the lettuce and tomato were also fairly fresh. Good bun as well. What made it average however, was that the burger patty had an off taste to it. I can't describe it any other way but to say it tasted stale. I don't know how that's possible in a burger but it's what it was. On other occasions, I've had the wings and they were okay as well. Salvaging the dinner however, was the French fries. They were double fried and very tasty. The burger came with a side of chipotle mayo which was a nice touch for the fries (intended or not). 

Staff was very friendly. Our waitress was one of the only servers on our floor on St.Paddy's Day and she was extremely pleasant, smiled a lot and did her job well. The staff overall has been excellent save for one bartender the first visit who was surly.

Overall a decent enough bar. Clean, good drink prices and decent table space."}
{"text":"The good: Great rooftop patio, like an oasis in the city, perfect for those living ay Yonge and Davisville.  Also, they have beer, so what's not to like?

The bad: Management changes hands faster than a hot potato.  Every time I went in here I was disappointed because my favourites were no longer available.  Service is also nothing to write home about.

The ugly:  The food.  We used to go here frequently for good food - they had an especially delicious spinach ricotta pizza.  The menu has changed a bunch of times, and the food just plain ol' sucks now.  Blech.

The only redeeming quality is the patio, and in this city, there is plenty of patio action to be had elsewhere."}
{"text":"To me this place is grummy. 
This place isn't packed on a regular basis, however it's not empty either. 

I walked in to watch the tail end of a Euro Cup game. 
The waitress was right infront of me talking to another customer casually.  At that point she could've told me to walk right in and take a seat.
I stood there for 5 minutes before just asking her.. \"Shall I sit anywhere?\"  And she flags her hand \"yeah sit whereever\"...  ooooook  thanks!  Strike 1. 

I had at the bar since I had no need to take up a whole table.  I sat with the retired men that stunk of beer and smokes.. argh.

Finally the same waitress came to take my drink and menu order. 
I had the fish and chips, which were decent.  No complaints. 

I don't like the look of the place and from what I've read from other reveiwers - this is a hit and miss place.

On my way out I had a tipsy older man ask me if I was leaving them and that I should stay because I'm something nice to look at.

I don't really like the patrons that occupy this place - so I won't be returning. 



I'd go across the street to the Twisted Kilt for some more classy people, AND a more authentic pub feel."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place got so many bad reviews!

The food is above par for pub fare.  Simple, juicy burgers, crispy fries, loaded nachos, crisp salads.  We're not talking upscale bistro- fru-fru cuisine, because let's face it a pub is for the everyman, not the one with a top hat and double windsor.

So for a good burger, a well priced pint, friendly staff, clean floors and fresh food, I'm not sure what else this pub could offer.  Live music perhaps? Then visit on a Thursday or Saturday!

If someone can point me in the direction of a pub that offers similarly good food, with good prices, friendly staff and approachable atmosphere I'll take the challenge.   Until then, Kramer's has a place in my heart!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place at least 2,3 times a week for years because I live across the street and it was such a nice, friendly place, but ever since the \"new managment\" started there, things has changed for worse... The place is not as clean as before, and the food has low quality but it's more expensive than before... now days I go to twisted quilt and the food, customer service, the ambiance and the management is much much better there."}
{"text":"I am lucky to live in a neighbourhood that is not bereft of restaurant choices. I've been here on several occasions: both before and after new management. Nothing to write home about. Serviceable bar. Maybe the servers are a sign of new management. My last server was friendly, welcoming and very helpful. The previous ones were not."}
{"text":"+ $7 pound of big wings, menu swaps out medium wing sauce for a tasty and more interesting curry/chili blend, $5 pints (bud), location, free phone charging station

- all wings but one were drumstick, patio had few bees lol

Service was fine

Prognosis: would def return"}
{"text":"A little neighbourhood bar at Davisville  where there are televisions and karaoke!!  The choice of beer on tap are extensive, and they have typical pub food.  I decided on a pound of lime and pepper chicken wings ($12) and a side of fries ($2).  The wings were big and tasted ok.  Salt and pepper still remains one of my favourite flavours.  Fries were plentiful.  For some odd reasons the length of the fries were very short. 
The atmosphere of the bar changed later on in the evening when people started singing karaoke and danced the night away.  Fun little place to hang out and let loose."}
{"text":"My biggest issue first foremost is with the service, Sometimes they make you feel like you are a major inconvenience asking for such things like a table, water, cutlery-  The nerve of some patrons!!!!

There seems like a regular crowd there that sits at the bar and gets rapid and friendly service, others not so much. If there were a staff only menu it would have to include the Prozac burger and Vicodin fajita wrap!

The breakfast menu looks great on paper but then again so does paint ball and that hurts like a mo-fo! The food doesn't taste fresh- I once ordered a cheese omelet and no joke you'd have to run forensic test's to find any cheese inside. I asked what was up and the waitress looked at me as If was crazy. Even worse they refused to make any concessions on my bill. 

If I do go there with my wife then make sure you arrive 20 minutes after us as we more times than not leave a full plate of food on the table- you get a free meal!!!!

The burger isnt bad and they do have wireless which is really nice, however its really hit or miss- many times a big miss!

Not all the staff are rude and cold however most are, many times the most exciting part about Krammers is leaving. You are overwhelmed with a strong sense of survival.

For a beer and some web surfing its great for a meal and pleasantries I suggest you roll the dice elsewhere."}
