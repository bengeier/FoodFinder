{"text":"Great owners. Cool staff. Fresh oysters. The cheese selection is divine. Oh - and the wine is well priced, it's dark and romantic, and I can walk home."}
{"text":"Our favorite place in Calgary. The food is always fantastic, the wine selection is great and the service is warm and keeps us coming back. I love their wine selection and their rotating menu!"}
{"text":"Agreed its in the high end price range for tapas, however you are also paying for excellent service (from both the servers and the charismatic kitchen staff) and great selection. We ended up here for date night on a random sunday and fell in lust. I can't say it would be a great place on the weekends as I think it would lose a lot of its charm when jammed packed. But for a quiet sunday gorge we found it perfect. The staff were amazing and the chef  (we sat at the bar facing the kitchen) was feeding us samplers all night. My opinion: go on a quieter night to really enjoy the place and you MUST order the cheesecake"}
{"text":"Amazing wines and cheeses. The only down side is the waitress refused to split the bill up. She said it was policy. It was just me and my friend that night. I could understand if there was lots of people with us but it was just the two of us."}
{"text":"Nice concept but extremely small portions.  I know it's a tapas bar / wine bar but after  a $120 tab for 2, we were drunk but still hungry, I think that's a little too impractical.  I've been to other renown fine dining establishments in other cities and tried items from their small plates menu for around the same price point and have been served a lot more food than what we got at the winebar.  I have to commend them for their extensive wine list, especially for wines by the glass. And I really liked the idea that they serve wines by the half glass (2.5 oz). That way I could choose a different wine with every dish we tried.  We started off with a glass of cava with some raw oysters. The oysters were ok.. nothing special. Definitely not nearly as memorable as the ones I had at Big Fish. Hence, I'd say the oysters were so-so by Calgary standards. Definitely nothing to write home about.  We then tried the chaucuterie. For a $16 plate, I don't think there was even 100g of meat in total there.  I wasn't totally crazy about it to say the least. Hence, for the next dishes, I thought we'd order something of substance.  We tried the beef short ribs braised in espresso-chocolate and the duck confit special they had that night. The shorts ribs were tasty but again, a little meagre on the portions. The duck confit was alright.. done properly, but again, nothing to write home about.  All in all, I would say this place was not up to my expectations. I had high hopes for this place as it is owned and run by the same people as Muse. I really wanted to like this place, but leaving still hungry after a $120 tab for 2, that's a little hard to justify. It would be easier to justify if the food was incredible. But it wasn't, it was just ok."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant several times. We really enjoy the quality of the food, but we just wish the portions were a bit bigger.  The wine list is impressive and the staff are knowledgeable. The chef and kitchen staff clearly know what they are doing and every plate that comes out looks and tastes amazing.   We like the casual elegance of this place. Despite the small portions, we plan to go back again... It is just so delicious."}
{"text":"Great wine selection by the glass or bottle, with very good cheese platter options and other dishes.  Good amount of bread and excellent condiments with the platter.    This cellar restaurant / bar with high windows at sidewalk level is well set up and the atmosphere mid-week and at weekends is good.    Battery powered candles on the tables and cheese platters served on a cheap plastic tray is a bit naff and doesn't match the other good aspects of the venue."}
{"text":"I love wine. It is life enriching and pleasurable. I cherish any opportunity to share, compare, and interpret the sensuous enjoyment and gratification associated with drinking wine. And I make no excuses for this passion. So discovering the Winebar Kensington last week, was the perfect start to my holiday break.   I was invited for a \"drink\" after work, with a colleaque, who is a \"regular\" at the Winebar.  I was totally surprised at what I experienced as I'm not one to lightly lavish praise on establishments. But this place impressed me greatly. And I'm not easily impressed.  The Winebar is situated in the basement of a building in the heart of Kensington. The venue is cool, comfortable, cosy, with a wonderfully warm and attractive interior design. The space is complimented by a number of street level skylights, allowing natural light to stream into the interior.  Imagine if there was stained glass in these windows, you would probably feel comfortable inviting your Priest around for a drink and getting a few confessions in at the same time.    It reminded me of the kind of basement wine bars that have been emerging over the past ten years in London and the now trendy old cities of Eastern Europe. It's the kind of place that you know, attracts smart, and elegant lovers of life; passionate people who are turned on by Ravel, Debussy and Scriabin. This place is not for the Hockey in Canada night, beer swilling, boozy crowd!   While it was quiet when I arrived at around 4pm, the place soon started filling up and the atmosphere grew warm and inviting as it grew darker. Upon arrival I was offered a glass of wine, and was soon introduced to the owner and the chef. The impression I got, was that these dudes know what they are doing, know what their loyal customers want and are amazingly responsive to their customers' needs.   Wine bars are for drinking and experiencing different varieties of champagne and wine! That's where the emphasis should be. Not on the food. And that's where the emphasis is, in this bar. Although they appear to have a great selection of food on their menu.   The wine selection is not enormous, but has a very broad offering across new world and old world wineries.  From Australia to South Africa, South America, Europe and of course the USA, and aspiring wannabe Canadian producers.   Either by the glass or the bottle, the selection is wonderfully affordable (Bottles ranged on average between $40 and $60/ bottle, and I do not recall seeing any wines above $90 a bottle) and  very drinkable. Great for those who simply want to quaff on their own, without having to pair the wine with anything, or anybody, and those who simply want to have a more meaningful relationship with the bottle, the body, the texture, the taste, and god forbid, the influence of the minerals in the soil. Trust me, I had a friend who was a geologist, and he took this kind of discussion to a different depth of depravity.   Food should be secondary and not the primary reason for going to a wine bar.  If you want a great meal, go to a great restaurant!  If you want to drink beer, go to a pub! The food here appears to be limited and is probably intended to be that way.  While I had some snacks, I did not eat a meal, so cannot comment on the quality of the food. They do have a handwritten board of specials on the wall above the bar, and the Chef assured me that he changed the menu regularly, with some things changed daily.   This place reinforces Calgary as an International City. I loved the place and will be back again. My fear is that I will become a regular now, and will become addicted, requiring me to bring my priest occasionally with me for absolution."}
{"text":"I really REALLY wanted to give five stars because I was super excited to come here. However, we were on a bit of a tight deadline (theatre tickets at 7:30 and my dining companion wasn't able to meet me until just after 6), so I'll have to return and re-evaluate when I have time to sit back and really luxuriate in the experience! I will say that when I mentioned to our server that we needed the bill because we had theatre tickets, they jumped on it IMMEDIATELY and we were all paid up and on our way within 3 minutes.  We had just enough time for two drinks and some cheese/charcuterie (which is one of our favourite things to do). The cheese list was super easy to navigate and helpful for making our decisions - and I loved that when the cheese tray came, the cheeses were labelled! I always forget which cheese is which after the rundown.  I do wish that the wine list had decsriptions on it the same way that the cheese list does. At least for the wines by the glass. I know you can always talk with your server and ours certainly was knowledgable, but due to our time crunch I found myself needing to make decisions between server visits. Grumpy Boyfriend (TM) started with a Manhattan, his go-to cocktail, and he thought it was a little bland. Not enough sweet vermouth, most likely... but it didn't affect the drink enough to stop him from enjoying it so it couldn't have been that bad!"}
{"text":"Winebar is my perfect kind of lounge-meets-tapas-bar. It's intimate, local, has an interesting menu and a good wine list.  Tucked away under a building on Kensington Road and 10th Street NW, a little restaurant sits that serves the best unbaked basil cheesecake this side of, well, anywhere.  The staff are very friendly and Winebar has made it's name on being a loungey type spot for drinks and small bites. Don't expect large American-dinner-sized portions but more like small, finger bites and tapas. The menu frequently changes except for a few all-time favorites that have been around since it's inception some 6 years ago.  As well as the food, pleasantly, the chairs are really really comfy making it very easy to settle in and slowly morph into a Nighthawk.  I would recommend Winebar for anyone wanting to treat their mother to a nice glass of wine, their partner to a nice glass of wine, their friends to a nice glass of wine or me, to a slice of unbaked basil cheesecake.  T."}
{"text":"Visited Winebar for my girlfriend's birthday and had the most fantastic time! We are far from wine connoisseurs but definitely wanted to include it on our girls/child free day. Our server made recommendations for us and hit the nail on the head with every glass. The food was amazing, the service was fabulous and the wine was delicious.. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My default \"go to\" place now in Kensington apart from Container bar for a drink or shared plates meals with friends. Love the addition of the patio which is a much needed addition to the street scape.   Great wine selection, but more importantly, great cheese pairings. The servers do a pretty good job helping you pair wine with cheese and I have personally never been disappointed with the selection.   The curried lentil and the potato gnocchi are great full-size meals for when you are hungry. The food does tend to be a bit on the blander side for me but the portions are really good.   Great place to meet up with friends and grab a drink for a chill night"}
{"text":"We were lucky to have a nice sunny day in which to utilize the summer patio. Happy hour is the time to go to save $2 a glass and still have access to the full menu. The in house made potato chips and dip is the way to start off. The potato chips are thin and crisp with a nice onion dip. To follow we had a very fresh ravioli with fresh cream and garden peas. Our second dish was a chicken confit sandwich which was extremely satisfying. Full of flavor but very simple with basil, tomato, and Romano cheese. Our third and very shareable dish was a curried lentil dip with bread. This had some spice and kick to it without being hot. The wine selection is plentiful so you won't have a problem finding something to your taste however there is only usually one beer on tap. After it is a wine bar. The patio makes this a must in the summer if you are Kensington. We had a dog with us and we tied him to the rail and he say just outside the patio. One of the employees was so kind and brought him a water bowl and for the rest of our meal he say happy as a clan as people walked by and petted him."}
{"text":"Came here with friends during the Diagon Alley day in July. It was okay, but not somewhere I'd go again anytime soon. Menu doesn't have a ton of variety in terms of palate and dietary needs to the point where a friend of mine didn't order anything. Chocolate frogs legs were interesting and the bean dip was great. I'm not a fan of the atmosphere but I could see it being a good date night! Seemed a bit overhyped when we were there, though."}
{"text":"Easily the best wine bar in Calgary.  Winebar has a dark, cozy almost wine cellar like feel to it. They also have a great patio out on Kensington road.  There isn't a poor quality wine on the list, and the staff are very knowledgeable about both the wines and what foods to pair them with. Food is small plates but the quality is definitely there, strongly recommend the cheese fondue!  The best part is their wine list is always changing, so there's something new to try every time you go. They seem to get a lot of lesser known yet high quality wines in, and their wine by the glass is the same price you'd pay for cheap wine at a pub. And if you're not sure what wine to choose, don't be shy about chatting up the staff and they'll steer you in the right direction!"}
{"text":"Tapa's at it finest fresh food. Great service!!! Love the oysters and the tomato balsamic tomato salad, soups  Menu changes"}
{"text":"The selection here is okay, the decor modern and hip, although if we're the only people in the place and we're trying to have a conversation; I'm not sure loud thumpa-thumpa was the best choice for the stereo. The noisy music versus the otherwise relaxed atmosphere, made it feel a bit disjointed.   We showed up on a Thursday evening at around 10:30 PM, and even though they close at 1 AM, kitchen staff was long gone. Apparently, according to the waitress, without informing anyone that they had left, so she took my order and had to come back and explain why she was empty handed.  Also, if I'm paying $4 for tea, I would at least like the water to be boiling hot rather than room temperature, so that by the time I refill it with the pretty glass pot you gave me, the tea isn't ice cold and not even properly steeped.   Still, it's not bad, I guess. I wouldn't seek it out, but I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"Waitress was cute and knowledgable effectively pairing the wine choice. Only had the lentil dip but it was delish! Nice ambiance and would definitely recommend it for a first date."}
{"text":"Going on a walk-about to explore Kensington has evolved into one of our greatest dining experiences since we moved to Calgary! Fresh food - yes! Amazing servers who want to enhance your dining experience, being attentive without hovering - yes! We love you L and A! A general manager who comes over, introduces himself and appreciates your business - yes! Thanks M! We took a seat at the bar of this cozy, cavernous, lower level, clean as a whistle wine bar and were wowed for about 3 hours (it was hard to leave!) The chef, C, knows his stuff and his passion is apparent. As a foodie, I sure had a lot to talk about and he was all for it! I loved watching him work focusing on FRESH ingredients. The care he took to make sure his station was wiped down and everything organized was there. Every 10 minutes an amazing new creation would waft over from the cook tops, teasing us to order more. We tried one platter with deliciously thin sliced meat, homemade potato chips with aioli and homemade pickles that were to die for! We also indulged in one of the best mushroom flat breads with a white sauce I have ever had. No soggy centers here! It was covered in greens (arugula?) and freshly grated parm cheese so it was like having a salad at the same time as the flat bread = less guilt! We also tried the house made truffles - so good, you have to close your eyes for a few minutes when noshing on them -as well as the chili passion fruit sorbet! Really? This would be what I would taste like if I were a sorbet in another life - it was heaven! The freedom the chef has to shop, create and please his guests was truly inspiring! No silly water charges here and our glasses never went empty. We really enjoyed the wine and beer where we just gave our server carte blanche to surprise us! I would indulge here 7 days a week if I could with this ever-changing menu (seasonal, as local as possible) and remarkable attitudes in this place. There is nothing I could even suggest to make this place better - it was perfect. Even the washrooms. There is even a fireplace for those chilly winter evenings. I want to keep this place a secret in a way - I do not want anyone to steal my fave bar seat but something this amazing in Calgary has to be shared amongst other foodies! 5 delicious stars!"}
{"text":"There's something I like about drinking wine in cozy underground spaces with great food.  If this sounds this sounds like something you might also enjoy, you should hang out at Winebar... And you should bring me with you. :)  They've got a great selection of charcuterie and cheese to pair with your vino and the staff to help you do it well. They've also got a talented crew working in the kitchen if you're looking for something more substantial.  It's classy, casual and comfortable, making it a great place for a date night or over the wonder that is fermented grape juice. It's got that social vibe like classy night cafe that serves wine instead of coffee. So I guess that makes it more like a bar that serves wine, or maybe even a \"Winebar\", if you will."}
{"text":"I frequent the wine bar fairly often in the winter months and have always enjoyed the cozy atmosphere,wine list is varied enough for a range of tastesand cheese selection also offers a nice variety,tapas are usually well thought out,that said you still end up spending the price of a four course meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I were staying in a hotel one block away and went wandering through the neighborhood. We hit the jackpot finding this gem! Michael, the chef, entertained us as he worked his magic putting together the most delicious looking dishes. We had a cheese/charcuterie board and a few glasses of wine. Wow. The duck liver mousse, the crackers, the jams, and pickled veggies, all made in house, were sooooo great! The cheeses and bread were added bonuses. A really great find! Anyone visiting Calgary should find their way to this culinary Mecca. Trust me!"}
{"text":"I really liked this cozy downstairs winebar.  If I lived in Calgary I would definitely be a regular.  (Well, as my budget would allow)  A tasty glass of white wine, Blasted Church Pinot Gris from the Okanagan Valley, was not served ice cold, thank you very much!  Next was a plate of Serrano Ham, manchego, delicious Turkish olives, and oil.  It was sort of piled into a salad/mixture and came with some nice bread and garlicky croutons.  I had a very good California Cabernet (Noble Tree), because much to my dismay, there were no Canadian reds available by the glass.  Tsk tsk........  I was meeting up with a friend later, so I took away a bottle of Coyote's Run Pinot Noir, which was pretty nice too.  (The Blasted Church wins, however)  The kicker, by far, was the absolutely delicious dessert - a caramelized pear bread pudding, with mascarpone ice cream.  It tasted even better than it sounds and was worth the price of admission.  If I'm in Calgary again, I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"I hate downgrading a review.  I need 19 ounces of scotch to give me the courage.  I've loved the service at this location every time.  This time was no different.  It was the food that made me cry.  The lobster risotto tasted great, but I know fake lobster when I see and eat it.  What a shame.  If you want to stay on top, bring in tails and use fresh ingredients.  I'll upgrade again soon, hopefully."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here last night. tapas style with an extensive wine list (as one would expect), knowledgeable servers, and classy yet unpretentious ambiance.  We started with a glass of Italian white paired with our half dozen west coast (cocktail) and half dozen east coast (pacific lambitini) oysters. They were well shucked minus some small shell fragments in two oysters and served with lemon, pineapple mignonette (a little overpowering) and fresh shaved horseradish. The oysters were definitely fresh and were two varieties neither of us had tried.  Next, on server recommendation we had the truffled deviled eggs and the beef carpaccio. We loved the deviled eggs. The carpaccio was tasty but a little heavy handed on the salt and the dish could have used a little more acid.  Finally we split a charcuterie board with three semi-soft/hard cheeses, two meat choices and accompaniments of various breads/crackers, pickled vegetables, mustard, and a delicious mango chutney. With this, we had a glass of the Mourvedre and the Malbec. Both were nicely representative of their varietals.  Overall we had a wonderful time and would certainly return with friends."}
{"text":"Months & Miles behind on my reviews I am trying to get a few done today!!  I have been to Winebar Kensington a couple of times.  Both with girlfriends (poor hubs)!  The second most recent was with my Italian BFF who was visiting from out of town.  Following a wander through Kensington and some pampering of our toes at Swizzlesticks we decided to stop into the Winebar for a quick glass and bite before racing home to get ready for a wine tasting later that evening.  It was shortly after 5pm on a Saturday when we wandered in and we were able to grab a couple stools at the counter.  Awesome. Love watching the chefs at work.  We decided on only 1 appy since we really didn't have a lot of time as our pedicure ran late.  We shared the fresh baguette, appenzeller \"fondue\" with cracked black pepper(my 2nd time having this delight).  and it was as tasty as the first time I tried it.  I wish we would have had more time to indulge in some additional appetizer's but it wasn't in the cards for us today.  A glass of wine and delicious fondue left us feeling happy when we left.  I know there is a third time in my future...hopefully it's soon!"}
{"text":"Interesting wine list and above average food offering. Ravioli was solid. Service was pleasant."}
{"text":"Winebar in Kensington is everything you could ask for in a winebar. Great wine selection, cheese and appetizers selection... friendly and helpful staff, and great location!  I like!"}
{"text":"I love love love this little wine bar. It's honestly adorable and you really do feel like you are underground. It's quiet which I appreciated as we were able to carry on a lovely conversation with our wonderful friends. The selection of charcuterie and cheeses is absolutely fantastic and we had a great time picking out things to munch on for our board. The wine selection is also wonderful and on Sunday's they have half priced vino! This is a great place to meet with friend and it's also a great date night! Kensington is one of my favorite places and this is one of the reasons why!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Friendly service. stylish comfortable place. Good place to go for a mellow evening date."}
{"text":"Great ambience!.... The appetizers are just ok.. But the wine is very good... The waiter recommended the octopus as the best appetizer ( honestly, it was not that good... Maybe my expectations were too high ) ... The duck fat fries were ok.. All other appetizers were not bad, but nothing really awesome... The wine is definitely the best thing this place has.."}
{"text":"I will definitely agree with Trish's review, the prices are quite high for the small portions.  However,  the food is really good.  All the dishes I tried were fantastic.  The wine selection is great, our waitress recommended a great bottle.  Also, the service was great.  I would definitely recommend, especially if someone else is footing the bill."}
{"text":"They look after their wines - keep them in excellent condition with rapid turnover, and they have some excellent things to try. Yes, I know that's what you'd expect from a wine bar... but they were much better than most that I've tried over the years. An interesting tapas style menu, beautifully prepared."}
{"text":"Veronica the server/bartender was very fun informative in a fun way.   They know there stuff.  And the chicken club was the most amazing moist delicious club sandwich I have ever had !!  Def coming back !"}
