{"text":"Never a disappointment. Great food and drink in a beautiful setting. Try the crab cakes!"}
{"text":"Great experience here. Limited menu but the food was delicious and the ambiance was very nice. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Went once - would not go back.  The music was so loud and horrible I couldn't get past it to even tell what I was eating.  I have to assume the food was not memorable since I can't remember it at all.  My friend and I were not even able to have a conversation.  I could not wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"It's a small sports bar trying to serve food that looks upscale but they aren't up to the task. We had undercooked shrimp. It would have been fine if I had ordered sashimi but I didn't . The pork steak was also undercooked and the baked potato looked like a pre-cooked re-heat. The wine was good but you can't screw that up. Save your money -- it was way over-priced for masquerading bar food.   Drive a little for food ... the Bistro models the dated hotel it's attached to."}
{"text":"Wow..wasn't expecting the food to be so good.  I will say they need to do some updating on the interior..and it looks like they are mid construction with doing this.  Overlook the paint, the torn up pavement...the food is fabulous.  Crab cakes can make or break a bistro...these are wonderful.  You can tell they put love into these.  I had the linguine pescatore special...outstanding!l   Others had the pork chop...comment was \"best he has had\".  Please, please support this local business.   The chef is amazing...and while the menu is somewhat limited the love and care they put into their food is evident."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best crab cakes and beer I've ever had!!! This place is such a hidden gem. Thank you Phil for the excellent food, beer and service...we definitely need more places like this in Fountain Hills"}
{"text":"Great new option for Ftn Hills/N Scottsdale-interesting entrees including Prime Rib on Saturday. Weekday Happy Hour includes pork ribs and pork carnitas Try the \"Last Call\" if you are a gin lover-large wine list also-French Onion Soup delicious"}
