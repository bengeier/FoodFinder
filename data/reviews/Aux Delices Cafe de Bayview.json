{"text":"If you are on your way to go shopping at Bayview Village, and you need to stop for a quick bite, look no further than Aux Delices Café.  Situated at the main entrance of Bayview, now in its third year of business at the mall, and judging by the patrons that came through in our lengthy Saturday afternoon visit, this place is a hit with the locals. Being situated in a bit more of an upscale mall, Aux Delices caters to their clientele. Health conscious foodies will delight in their selection of fresh, gourmet ingredients, including Panini's, pastas, crepes, salads, and even specialties like duck l'orange and homemade gelato, just to name a few. There menu is ever changing, depending on seasonal availability, so there is always something new to try at Aux Delices.  We started our meal with the fresh manicotti and roasted mushroom caps, duck l'orange with mushroom and greens, and roasted eggplant salad. Everything tasted like fresh, home cooking. The manicotti ($6.50) was amazing, with melt-in-your-mouth ricotta, and ripe tomatoes that tasted like they were picked form the garden that morning. The stuffed Portobello mushroom cap with cheese and polenta was an awesome side dish, complementing the Italian flavours in the manicotti, but would be great as an entrée on its own.  The duck l'orange was cooked perfectly, tender and succulent, the sauce was sweet and tangy, and the accompanying side salads of oyster mushrooms and greens, and roasted eggplant were in a league of their own. I would have returned just to try a sampling of all their fresh veggie salads.  Next up, a roasted vegetable Panini, recommended by our host. The yellow pepper, red onion and eggplant were soft and easy to eat, with a nice portion of goat cheese on lovely focaccia bread. Moving into crepe territory, we decided to tackle the ham and cheese crepe ($9.50), with tomatoes as well, and would go back for more. Their crepes are light and fluffy, and packed with ingredients. Even better, your crepe is made right in front of you, and you can add any ingredients you like. A fun experience for kids, too.  For those looking for the \"café\" experience, they serve up delightful illy coffee, and Rahier desserts, that almost make you feel like you are dining in Europe. Their double espressos were great, nice and bold, and the latte was perfect, frothy and steamed to perfection. The homemade gelato was amazing. I love ice cream, and have been a latecomer to the gelato trend, but I am glad that I tried it. We sampled the chocolate, vanilla and pistachio, a must when having gelato, and they were all very well done. The vanilla and chocolate especially, both true to their flavours, with a natural, nuttier taste, rather than overtly sweet.  Aux Delices Café offers a fabulous dining experience, and allows you to stop in for a fast and easy meal, or linger over a cup of coffee and a pastry. All of their meals are available to go, making it a great option to stop in after work for a ready-made meal. Gourmet meals ready as soon as you order, great coffee and homemade gelato should have you stopping for a break on your next shopping trip."}
{"text":"Priced relatively similar to Starbuck's coffee, their mocha latte was pretty awesome. It wasn't too sweet and the espresso shot was strong, just the way I like it! The coffee lid is like ones you find in Asia, that has a sliding stopper. Seriously, why hasn't this lid been used for Tim Hortons or Starbucks?   I don't frequent this mall, but there are plenty of regulars that occupy the seating area. The pastries also look delicious - I'll be sure to try something next time! Service is fast and efficient - everything is made in the open kitchen in the middle, and you can see that machines and materials are kept clean and orderly.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"It is open; same company, different name for Cafe.   Food is good, nothing special. Healthy options. I don't like service. Girls don't look at you when you asking questions or even ordering, looks like they are trying to push you through faster. If you need to substitute or adjust something in the food you want to order, you will get quick and annoyed - NO, WE DONT DO THAT!"}
{"text":"The pastries are really good. Coffees are great. The only thing I did not like was there no system in ordering. For pastries you order on the left side. For hot dishes you order on the right side. For coffee, you just have to grab someone's attention and order, that is, if they will pay attention, as there were a few people behind the counter and they too seemed lost as to what they're supposed to do. On a not so busy day, I wouldnt mind coming back though."}
{"text":"Living near the area, we had a craving for gelato on a warm day and remembering they sold it, decided to stop.   Not only was it not really gelato, but it was overpriced and very, very bland.  Can't comment on the other offerings so I added ice cream to the description list for Yelp."}
{"text":"When I read about bayview village and its \"ladies at lunch\" feel (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/bayview-village-shopping-centre-north-york), this cafe is what I think about.  I come here for breakfast sometimes and I really like it. Maybe it has to do with the fact that I love omelettes in the morning and they make omelettes. Either way, they make good omelettes. HAHAHA. Also their bread is very good. I bought a loaf on a whim and it was spectacular (but then again, there I am with my weirdness--I like bread plain). It's a nice little place to sit and eat--maybe with a friend, maybe alone with your (home)work, whatever floats your boat at this kind of \"classy\" cafe (if those exist).  (Wow parenthetical overkill in this review (hmm...) much?)"}
{"text":"Amazing espresso gelato (small cup for $3.69). Cheesecake was impressive, but the price is steep (slice for $6.95).   Good location as it's next to the library and just steps to the parking lot!"}
{"text":"I don't know what people are talking about saying it's a good place. I haven't tried their food to be fair but I went there for gelato and cappuccino today and was incredibly disappointed.  Gelato: supposed to be smooth, creamy, and not too sweet (though this varies). Their gelato was too sweet, pistachio had a very light taste and did not taste as nutty as it should've been. Texture-wise it was a disappointment as well. Not smooth, a lot of ice crystals and the taste was just unpleasant. Bacio was disappointing too. For those of you who said they enjoyed Aux Delices' gelato, try Mad Italian (College or Bayview location) or La Paloma (new location in Yorkdale, DineOn3). That's amazing gelato. Doesn't get any better in Toronto.  Cappuccino: oh boy, that was terrible. Tim Hortons lattes are better than this! The foam wasn't frothed properly, there was barely any espresso in it... it kind of tasted like muddy water with bad milk foam.  The service wasn't good either. There must have been 4-5 people working there but they couldn't handle 3 customers at a time with small orders (i.e., drink+ gelato/pastry). They seemed very flustered, did not smile, transferred me back and forth between each other and confused me. Not to mention that for their prices, it was very subpar.  Will not come back and do not recommend."}
{"text":"What can I say, my \"Cafe aux Lait\" has crummy drip coffee with steamed milk and it was disgusting. I don't think the barista knew how to use the espresso machine. I saw another patron return her coffee as well. The deserts were just average fair you would find behind the counter at a Loblaws bakery. We couldn't try the crepes because they were sold out 2 hours before closing on a Sunday.  Don't go even if you are really desperate. There is a Starbucks at the other end of the mall that serves average, but consistently OK lates and snacks."}
