{"text":"These folks have some great BBQ!  Pulled pork and pork ribs were so well smoked and lightly sauced, that I didn't need to add any!  I did try their sauces on my fries and they were great as well.  Homemade cornbread was great as were the pickles on the tray.

The place is dressed up nice and southern style, so much so, I felt like I was back home in North Carolina.  Not what I would have expected this far north!

The folks working the restaurant were very nice and accommodating.  I'd hate to take them away from Montreal, but they could do really well in NC!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pulled pork of any current food truck/stand I've tasted in Montreal. The meat is flavourful, the prices are reasonable for the portion size and the service is quick and friendly. They've always got everything you need ready by the truck, too - rolls of paper towels, forks, extra bbq sauce...
Try anything from this truck and you'll be happy with it. Their sandwiches are awesome, filling but never too messy. The smoke dog is a little messy but delicious. The poutine will make strangers jealous that they are not you, at that moment in time, eating that poutine. The mac and cheese is the only item on their menu that I'm not 100% happy with, but I'd still eat it again.
Definitely worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Awesome food, authentic southern BBQ. Fresh lemonade is a must. Highly recommend for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"First time in Canada and first time trying Poutine. Got the beef brisket and it was delish!!! Also the big pickle and coleslaw were great! Sweet ladies at the counter were very quick and super nice :) give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Pros:
Mac & cheese (with homemade sausage and pulled pork? Yes, please!)
Pork ribs
Fried chicken
Fries with dipping sauces
Brisket
House baked rolls
Coleslaw
Campfire milkshake with bourbon (topped with a perfectly toasted s'more!)
(Ok everything we ordered was delicious!)
No line-up

Cons:
Wait time"}
{"text":"Delicious. We had the ribs and they were sensational. Smoky, spicy and just right sweet. We will be back to try out the rest of the menu. My bourbon lemonade was good too"}
{"text":"We've only been here twice (once for poutine week, and once just 'cuz) and oh how I Heart the pulled pork. If you're not a big meat-person (I'm more of a carbs person) I recommend the Mac and cheese. It comes with a good (side) portion of pulled pork and the cheese sauce on the Mac is ridiculously good and decadent. Has a decent drinks menu, too!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Le Smoking twice now and I am completely in love with this place.
Everything is prepared in house, including a wide selection of meats, traditional bbq sides like cole slaw baked beans potato salad and fries. They also have a selection of beers and even signature cocktails. 
The meat is incredibly tender and flavorful, but not mushy or over-seasoned. There is a wide selection of sauces to be added, all of which are delicious. My personal favorite is the coffee bbq. Dark, tangy, complex but not pretentious in any way. Just delicious. The home-baked rolls are a real highlight. 
Prices are fair for the amount and quality of food. One complaint? Their fries are really a mediocre product. Have some baked beans or potato salad instead.
Wonderful experience, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent poutine au porc effiloché... c'est leur spécialité. Je suis fan. Allez y les yeux fermés."}
{"text":"Went here cause it's right in the area I am staying. Really solid bbq and sides. Really good dessert. Poutine was nicen"}
{"text":"After watching Kung fu Panda 3, we were so hungry. 
OHOHOH New restaurant :D
I recognized the logo from food trucks.
We went inside. Warm welcoming, decoration feels like \"Cabane a sucre\" style. Good ambiance.
Concept is simple. Order, pay then sit. 
We went for the Combo 2 meats + side dishes to try the meats omgogmog
They offered chicken, pork sausage, BEEF BRISKET!!! and RIBS!!!
Going crazy we tried the ribs, pork sausage and beef brisket.
I was lucky haha. He brought a new beef brisket and cut it in front of me. From what I understood, there is a part of \"fatty\" meat and lean meat. I tried boths. TENDER as fck (14h cooking )and you can feel the juiciness of the fat. Amazing. I crave for tender beef.
Brisket is a cut meat from the breast or lower chest of the beef.
We sat they offered us different sauce to try with the beef.
I really like the spicy bbq. For fries, we also have different combination of Mayonnaise which was pretty cool.
I'd say the focus was really on meat quality. Good price for it.
Overall, good experience. Meat lover haha
Definitely going back to try more meat or their famous poutine!"}
{"text":"To help anyone who need to read a quick review, I will cut out the fat and go straight into the meat. 

The best part of my experience was when I got out... or their lukewarm water in a mason jar [it helped wash away the taste]. 

Multiple servers on site during off-peak hour who are inattentive to customer's needs. 

Ordered Items
Beef Brisket Poutine - $12.99
3 Meat, 2 Sides - $21.99

Poutine was unrecognized by the kitchen staff and was forgotten; it came out when we reminded the server... which she didn't even know existed. 

The poutine was awful. So awful that the this was the convo. 

Server: \"Do you want that to go?\" 
Me: \"No.\" 
Server: \"Did you not want to eat it?\" 
Me: \"We ate some?\" 

The poutine was barely touched. 

The restaurant was operating during off-peak hours... either that or I made the mistake of going there. 


Pros: 

Sides: Potato salad.
Pork belly
Tap water

Con:

Below average quality food. 

One server was decent and tried... but you have more than one server at your table...that's if they know you are there."}
{"text":"Was very excited when this place opened up. Unfortunately its very average. Meat was dry, fries oily and thin, portions tiny, prices not great considering portion size as well. If it wasn't for the coupon I had it would not of been worth it at all. Will not be returning as there are better BBQ options in the city."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Chanced upon it during our walk through the Old Port. Friendly people. We had the smoked beef pouting. They used roasted potatoes instead of French fries, which held up very well to the gravy. As for the beef, it was ok. We are from a Texas so..."}
{"text":"Cutest little joint ever, with it's wood and brick, amazing smell, you won't resist passing by. Everything is delicious and you must try the corn bread. Nice add to our hood."}
{"text":"I just tried Le Smoking BBQ at the Old Port for the Poutinefest, it was outstanding, had the pulled pork poutine and true to their word best poutine. A must try thank goodness they stick around on the island."}
{"text":"Meh.. This place was ok. They were out of something I wanted so I got chicken. It was not bad but the fries were pretty much burnt. Service was extremely slow. Waitress didn't bring us any condiments or napkins even. 4 stars because it wasn't the worst meal I had and then the waitress rang us up on the register saying it was her first day so Im trying to have some sympathy there."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have been here on two separate occasions while on a hunt for some good BBQ and both times we were satisfied with our food but didn't find it to be out of this world.

We've tried the beef brisket (not great, not bad), the pulled pork (we've both had better), and the beef ribs (excellent) as the meats. We've also tried the coleslaw (delicious), fries (yum), cornbread (good), and home bread (both times we both took a bite and didn't want to eat the rest).

Overall, prices are decent and food is ok. If you happen to be in the area, go ahead and grab some ribs but be wary of some of the other items as they may leave you a little disappointed."}
{"text":"On a pris et partage des côtes levées de 8 places. On a bien aimé le \"uncle ...\" (Sam?). Une cote levée complète était 23$, ce qui n'est pas cher pour une cote levée, mais il n'y a pas d'accompagnement à ce prix là, alors il faut prendre autre chose. La facture grimpe rapidement, mais après une cote levée, on avait le ventre assez rempli. 

Il n'y a pas assez de tables, malgré qu'on y a été un lundi soir. 

À essayer au moins une fois."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place and it had really cool decor inside. Once we got inside we were warmed up immediately from the freezing cold snow outside and our nostrils was completely consumed by the smoky smell of chicken and pulled pork. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, smoked chicken, and pulled pork poutine. Everything was scrumptious. Definitely recommend it, especially the pulled pork sandwich which was a perfect combination of meat and fresh, crunchy coleslaw. Combine this with a light German apricot beer and you are set."}
{"text":"I got their pulled pork poutine and really enjoyed it. Granted it was my first poutine so I might be missing out on the \"real \" deal. Service was fast and good, no complaints there. Just wish the pulled pork didn't have BBQ sauce, I'd like to try it without."}
{"text":"This was our first stop for food when we arrived in Montreal for the first time. The poutine and smoked sandwiches were great! I love the coleslaw they put on the on the roll and added some of my pork to the poutine (gotta try that). I love the way they smoke their pork, touch of sweetness and a lot of smokey flavor - much better than some other places that use the vinegar based crap,  yuck. 

Definitely a place to go if you want a nice experience and to relax. Drinks were actually really good too! We had Jack on the rocks with Ginger, $7, but not a waste of money at all.

The service was good too. Our server was super friendly and accommodating - asking us how our meals were and small talk...."}
{"text":"The BBQ is pretty good for Montreal. It doesn't reach the quality of Black strap BBQ or Dinette Triple Crown, but both are on opposite sides of town."}
{"text":"I know its good tasting food because I've eaten here a few times before. This time I ordered through Just Eat. I ordered exactly what Katy P ordered (3M 2S, same picks). It didn't sit well this time, maybe because of the food itself, or maybe because I over ate (In Katy's review she split this 2 ways). Either way, I tried to sleep it off, but I woke up the next morning with food poisoning... The poisoning could be from LSB or from some other food I ate earlier, I don't know.  I feel awful writing this review, I know its great tasting food and a quality establishment at LSB, but ill probably never eat red meat again from anywhere after this. 

This is definitely an outlier review, I remember loving this place but now thats over, my stomach associates this food with some of the most miserable feelings I can remember."}
{"text":"I was downtown yesterday and just noticed this place.

From the rustic decor and menu items reminiscent of Blackstrap BBQ in Verdun, I figured it's worth a try.

I ordered their pork rib poutine and even though the portion size was a little small, it still tasted great. I did want to try their strawberry cheesecake milkshake, but they were out of cheesecake, so I settled for plain vanilla. Oh, well, next time..."}
{"text":"Very disappointing
Imadake was full 
Kazu was closed.

Waited over a hour for food for two poutines and some wings.

They ran out of gravy so they used water on the poutines I don't even know if that's legal.

I ordered deep fried pickles got 1 pickle.

Had to go ask for gravy cause they forgot and that's when I found out it was water. 

I won't ever return."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to check it out for a while but I have too many vegetarian friends :). Today I finally made it here, accompanied by a carnivorous companion! 
The have a fine balcony. But today was chilly, so we sat inside, and it was great. Love the wooden decor! 
We got the 3 meats and two sides combo to share, with two lemonades. 
The lemonade was very sweet!
The meats: 
- Sausage - nice! fatty, and a touch of spicy. 
- Brisket - soft and falling apart to the touch. yammi!
- Pulled pork - sweet and tasty! not overtly fatty. 
The fries were kinda standard, but the baked beans were some of the best I had in Quebec, but we just could not finish! 
This combo is a good size for two hungry people. 
Check please: ~$36 with tax and tip.
That is very decent considering the quality/quantity.
I should come back for the ribs and chicken another time!"}
{"text":"This place is literally right next to where I live so I decided to pop in. I was craving a burger and that's what I ordered. My appetite was quite big so when it came it was huge. It consisted of  a burger, pulled pork, kielbasa bacon with cheese and coleslaw...wow!! Yummy!! Unbelievably I ate it all, and with the fries it came with. That's was the best combo I ever had. Great place! You get lots to food for your buck. Lol"}
{"text":"I've been there 3 times, and it was absolutely awesome every time. As a friend of mine described it, it is basically a non-stop heaven of meat. I tried to cut on the richness, fat and starchiness last time I went by ordering a, very respectable and tasty might I had, tomato salad. However, the fries, and consequently the poutine, is delicious and I would highly recommend people to get those instead. The poutines are huge, the waitress told us it was 2 pound of fries + the meat. I was never capable of finishing it.

I tried the ribs, the pulled pork, the sausages, the brisket, the poutine version of the ribs and the pulled pork, and it was all amazing. I personally prefer the brisket, which is smoked fat goodness, and the pulled pork, which is also as delicious. 

Beer is relatively inexpensive too. 

This might not be as good as true southern Barbecue, but this is as good as it gets Up north."}
{"text":"This was some of the best barbecue I have ever had. I was visiting Canada and I wasn't expecting to find good barbecue but it was really good. I highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"okay so I can't really rate the restaurant itself but I had the BBQ ribs from their food truck at the zoofest festival and they were to die for....the meat fell right off the bones and the BBQ sauce was the perfect mix of sweet and spicy. I wish I bought a jar of their sauce, will definitely be trying the restaurant the next time I'm in Montreal !"}
{"text":"First had their famous pulled pork poutine at Osheaga 2 years ago. It is amazing! Now they opened their own resto and even though it's only been open a few weeks and I live and work on the south shore, I have already been there twice. Pulled pork is moist, smoky and full of flavour. Their poutine is top notch and their new Mac n Cheese waffle is insanely good! A definite Montreal icon in the making."}

{"text":"Honestly the best pulled pork ever. Flavourful and melts in your mouth, they also give you lots on the poutine. I wasn't a fan of pulled pork before because it was sometimes tough and got stuff in your teeth, but this was absolutely amazing. Cool decor complete with country music, this is a nice joint to be cozy and spend some time inhaling the scents inside. Also, the employees there seem super cheerful."}
{"text":"Le Smoking BBQ reminded me of BBQ in the South. My fiancé and I ordered the 3 meat combo and we selected the sausage, the brisket and brontosaur (beef) rib with sides of corn bread, fries, and baked beans. We also ordered their Smoking Mac & Cheese that also came with pulled pork and sausage. The favor for each item listed was impeccable.  The meats were smoked properly and fell off of the bone. We also ordered a pitcher of Alabama Slammer cocktail. It was delish but however, super weak. It tasted like super expensive juice. Though the meal was tasty, we feel as though we should let you know the cooks weren't wearing gloves. But from where we are from, cooks that do not wear gloves usually throw down in the kitchen. And these cooks certainly did so! Overall, the food and the visit is definitely well worth it!"}
{"text":"First time there. Thanks to yelp I found this place. I found it a little bit expensive but God it was good. Service is nice, they guide you pretty well with their products. Barmaid wasn't very concerned with us, not really helpful either but nothing so bad. I'll come back eat this deliciousness"}
{"text":"Love it. Simple menu, nice portion, different dressing to choose for the ribs and reasonably priced. More of a fast food restaurant type of place. Stop by for a quick bite of those delicious ribs. Oh and don't forget the pulled pork! Yummy"}
{"text":"The pulled pork poutine is amazing! I almost always order this when I come here. They put a lot of juicy meat on top of quite a generous serving of poutine. I've never been able to finish my plate no matter how hungry I was. The sweet BBQ sauce on the pulled pork goes very nicely with the savory poutine gravy.

Their lemonade is also very good. It's freshly made with real lemons when you order it."}
{"text":"I don't usually feel the need to write reviews however our service last night was atrocious. We were seated very promptly. However were very quickly forgotten about. We were ready to order once our server finally came around. Then after having to come back multiple  times because \"nobody stocked the fridge\", we finally got our drink orders. The waiter apologized multiple times but it did not make up for the fact that after an hour we went to the front to see our order had not even begun to be cooked (the kitchen is visible) and we asked for our bill. It was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Their food truck attended the Laval Poutine fest and I opted for their combo bacon and Italian sausage poutine. 

This was my kind of gastronomic poutine! Their signature BBQ sauce complimented well a hearty and delicious poutine with generous amounts of bacon and Italian sausage. This $13 meal was my lunch and dinner as it stuffed me to the rafters. The poutine was very solid and the fries was just right.

Good price, good food. 

A food truck to come back to in the future when opportunity presents itself."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best barbecue places in Montreal. The pulled pork and beef brisket both had really great flavor. Mac and cheese waffle was pretty unique and while I didn't LOVE it, it was quite good and is worth trying. I was a little disappointed by the fried chicken, wouldn't recommend ordering it. The poutine is similar to the one from the food truck, highly recommend the pulled pork one.

The atmosphere is cool, fairly casual yet well decorated to the Midwest BBQ type of theme. You order and then sit, so you don't need to tip for service. The prices are fairly reasonable as well, depending on what you order! You could potentially go quite cheap if you just get sandwich. I'd say itd be between $10-20, depending on what you order and how hungry you are.

Highly recommended for anyone into BBQ! Good for Montreal but I wouldn't consider it the most amazing I've had."}
{"text":"Hi, perfect Hell. Dental work in progress means no chewing, soft food only. *sigh* so I'm going for a milkshake only. 
But being from Virginia, the menu, the smells, the happy ribbers mean I'll be back. And they have BURNT ENDS which means my wife would approve."}
{"text":"Beau festival! Bons ribs, bonne ambiance. Je n'ai pas été déçue. En espérant que l'expérience se répète l'an prochain!"}
{"text":"This was my first Montreal meal and all I can say is OMG. Definitely don't go in if you're not looking for a big meal, the poutine portion is enormous! Everything was delicious! 

We got a brisket poutine and a BBQ brisket sandwich. The sandwich was just enough but the poutine was enough for 2 or 3 people, it was huge but so delicious.  It was more than I expected to pay for fries and BBQ, but when you see and taste that poutine, it's so worth it. It's super casual, just a pop in for lunch place, which was perfect for us"}
{"text":"Try the pull pork poutine! So good, it's won awards! Sausage was great as well. Nice casual place. Was not a disappointment at all."}
{"text":"Nous avons retesté pour le Ribfest et cette fois ci au menu le combo suivant : 
- 1/2 rack de ribs
- 1/2 lb de porc effiloché
- salade de chou 
Pour info c'est un combo à 19$ et à mon sens cela vaut le coup et représente bien ce foodtruck. J'en suis ressorti sans faim et avec pas mal de sauce sur les doigts :)

Je reitère donc avec ma remarque de la dernière fois comme quoi le porc effiloché est un de leur point fort. 
Les ribs sont bonnes, bien assaisonnés et bien cuites ! Vraiment satisfait de cette nouvelle découverte :)

Je remonte donc la note à 4 pour les ribs et la qualité du porc effiloché !"}
{"text":"Went to Quebec for a music festival a few months ago, and Le Smoking BBQ was there. We tried a couple other food trucks, but Le Smoking blew them out of the water! We were hooked and ate no where else for the rest of the fest. It's in a league of its own. I'm from the states and I thought we knew bbq, and I was dead wrong. My mouth still waters thinking and imagining their food. The ribs fall off the bone and the BBQ pork poutine fries were unlike anything I have ever had! It's hard to comprehend that it was coming from a food truck! I actually consider driving the two-three hours to Montreal just to quench my craving for their food on a weekly bases."}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday evening when there were a few tables. The decor is cute and what you'd expect from a BBQ place.  The smell was divine. We ordered the brisket (tasty, melt in your mouth), ribs (ok), pork belly (decent), corn bread (delicious), baked beans (thick, meaty, good), and fries (fine).

The service was a little slow.  The waitress was young and did a poor job in prioritizing. She seemed to be only waitress but restaurant wasn't busy. As previous reviewers have written, it's an open kitchen so you can see your food. We were sitting at a table across from the kitchen so saw our order sitting on the counter. When the chef placed the order there, he rang a bell so waitress would know and that's what caught our attention too. Understandably she continued doing what she was doing (grabbing leftovers from a table and packaging them up). But then she grabbed more dirty dishes, put them away, and then went to the table beside us to take their coffee orders and then went to the back of their restaurant to make their drinks. I didn't time it, but our food sat there while she continued to walk by it (I'm estimating 6-8 minutes). In total, she passed by our food five times and couldn't take 10 seconds to just grab it and give to us. We were literally four feet away.

In the end, we actually got up and asked the chef if we could just help ourselves. Our food was getting cold and would only continue getting colder (cold fries and baked beans -- not so good). He was kind enough to grab forks and give to us since it was obvious we weren't getting it anytime soon.

I felt bad since we did that, but then the guilt disappeared when she didn't even acknowledge our wait. I've worked as a waitress before and know how hard it is, but then know people are understanding if they are given explanations for mistakes or acknowledgement of excessive wait times. 

I also agree with one reviewer who commented it would be nice to know in advance of ordering if they are out of something. Lucky for us, it wasn't the case but when we ordered the brisket she asked the chef if he still had some. (Yes, we were that close to the kitchen that she could ask him from our table.)

Food was good, but not so good that we would take a chance on service again. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Wow! Absolutely amazing! I had heard amazing things about the brisket poutine and it definitely did not disappoint. The sauces are delicious as well. I can't wait to come back and try the fried chicken or the ribs. I will be coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"Le smoking BBQ was pretty good, I got a beef brisket with fries. My brothers got the pull pork and poutine, the other got the smoking club. They looked pretty satisfied. However, I think the beef brisket was a winner, because it's not a huge amount of portion and the fries fills you up. The only problem I had was that the beef brisket that I got was extremely fatty, if they offer a leaner choice I'd be really appreciative. But I'd order that again anyways. As well, the atmosphere was a bit dark. but the decor was cool, it remind me of the Wild West. Anyways, over all the experience was positive and I'd go there again."}
{"text":"I came back for a second try and saw that some changes had been made. The meats are no longer getting wet while being warmed in shallow plates floating on hot water. Instead they are being brought out from their kitchen in the back and are put on display only for a short time before being served.

I'm glad I gave it a second shot. I would come back when I feel carnivorous in the future."}
{"text":"I went to PoutineFest at Dix30 in Brossard this weekend, amazing crowd and couple of poutine food trucks with different flavours of this iconic Quebecer dish! 
Smoking BBQ was the most popular one on Friday, the line-up was very long, with that waiting time you are expecting to be the best poutine of the food fare...they were showing banners with \"Best montreal poutine 2015-2016-2017\". Maybe i was unlucky but the poutine i got, pulled pork, was very disappointing.
1-the overall dish was cold, very unpleasant
2-the fries were cold and some undercooked
3-the pulled pork was cold and dry
4-lack of gravy
5-the curdle cheese wasn't even melting
With the big crowd and fast turnover, i expect the food to fresh and hot since you need to prepare alot of food.
The potential of the poutine is there but with all the point mentioned above, i am sorry to say the poutine was far from the best poutine i had in my life.
The only good thing in the dish was the bbq sauce.
Sorry but hot food and consistency is very important"}
{"text":"As an American from the south I have a lot of opinions about bbq. Luckily I'm from Atlanta and we don't really have a distinct style we just like bbq, so I'm not a purist. That being said, the authenticity here is questionable, but the food is good. 

They were out of brisket so I got pork ribs and pork belly. I always try ribs because they seem to vary the most in bbq restaurants. They were good but instead of having any of the southern BBQ sauce flavors they kind of tasted like chinese bbq. It wasn't bad at all and the ribs were pretty tender but it was just unexpected. The pork belly was tasty and had some awesome crispy parts, but it was a little dry and undersalted overall so I needed the sauces.

The baked beans were again untraditional but reallyy good. They were kind of a cross between baked beans and Brunswick stew so they had a decent amount of meat in them. We got cornbread by mistake and it was on point. Sweet buttery cornbread, no complaints. What we had actually ordered (and the waitress brought it right away when we pointed it out ) was the potato salad which was unlike any southern potato salad I've had. The potatoes are fries and tossed in a potato salady sauce. It tastedgood but it could have used about 3x the sauce.

Not a BBQ dish, but we also got the MTL poutine fest 2017 winner, the cheeseburger poutine. It was really good, not sure how it couldn't be honestly. Completely loaded with burger meat and cheese and they put a thousand islandy sauce on it. Would definitely recommend.

Our waitress was very nice and the beer selection was  good as we. Im confused why there was no one else I'm the restaurant on a Saturday night because I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"I recommend the burger with beef, sausage and pulled pork. The potato salad is also delicious. The rib and pork belly are more normal."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered Ribs poutine ,Nachos and another main dish. The size is very big for us. I prefer nachos. The other two dishes are a little more salty for me."}
{"text":"Tried their poutine at the poutine fest that took place at Yonge and Dundas. Got the half pulled pork and half ribs poutine, for $16 it was pretty good."}
{"text":"May be I had high expectations after trying Smoking BBQ food truck poutine. They were a hot mess, but clearly indicating potential goodness. 

The real experience for poutine week turned out to be disappointing. May be this is not fair as I really like simple poutine, classical ingredients complimented with an extra or two. The poutine week special Lucky Luke unfortunately was overwhelming, just too much for me, I did not feel the ground beef is apple smoked, nor I understood the flavor of the poutine sauce, the maple syrup caramelized onions were lost in between the tater tots and french fries. At least somehow the cheese curds remained intact and were still yummy. I also don't like the fact the meets have to be ordered in combo. Combo for one contains two meets and two sides, the amount of food is may be OK for a guy, the ladies may prefer a single choice of only ribs or only pulled pork. In the case of the lady sitting next me the ribs were unpleasantly charred, at least the puled pork was definitely delicious and I could taste it is apple wood smoked. 

The restaurant has a full bar drinks menu with incredible beer list from Quebec breweries. We had an amazing smoky beer from Le lièvre microbrewery, look for the Phénix everywhere, it is a treat. The ambiance is cool looking, but chairs not very comfortable, not the pub you would hang around forever. Chances of me coming back are low, but who knows."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after reading mostly positive reviews here. When I entered the restaurant with my friend, it was full of smoky flavorful BBQ smell. 

I ordered a combo that comes with 2 choices of meat and 1 side. I chose beef brisket, sausages, and coleslaw. My friend ordered poutine with pulled pork. After waiting for a few minutes, my meal came in an unproportionally huge tray on a parchment paper which I think it doesn't add any values to dining experience, unless the purpose was to make it easy to clean. A small piece of bread, one little sausage, and two little pieces of brisket, and coleslaw took only 30% of the tray. It made me feel like I had a high school cafeteria tray on a day when most meal options at the stations are unavailable. 

The brisket was so tender it was almost falling apart, but BBQ is not all about texture. Unfortunately, it was lacking flavour a lot. It was bland. If I didn't put BBQ sauce on it, it might have tasted even more bland. I don't know if they smoked the meat properly or long enough. The sausage was ok, nothing special. Coleslaw was a crime. It was the most tasteless coleslaw I have ever tasted in my life. It was just white cabbage smothered in something creamy white. It desperately needed more acid and sugar. It was just a white crunchy thing. I don't know what I chewed. Even KFC coleslaw is better. Better yet, just walk into a local deli or a grocery store and get a coleslaw, that would be better than this coleslaw.

My friend's poutine was better than my meal. Pulled pork on poutine was soft and flavourful. I might have had a better dining experience if I ordered something different, but overall, it was very disappointing. I have had better BBQ."}

La poutine est très bonne. J'ai pris en accompagnement viande du porc effiloché et du brisket de boeuf. Le pulled pork est de bonnrme qualité ! Mais la sauce est un peu sucrée à mon goût.

Au final, je recommande !"}

{"text":"Just stopped in here for a snack. I ended up ordering the pulled pork poutine and a float. Both were delicious and the staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Updated review:

Wow! Our second experience at le Smoking BBQ confirmed for me that this place is a winner!! As I said before in my first review, the meat is so tender and delicious. This time, I shared a 3 meat (smoked sausage, pulled pork, beef brisket), 2 side (beans, coleslaw) combo and it was just enough for two of us to get our fill and not feel stuffed. The smoked sausage is snappy on the outside and so tender and delicious inside, with a good \"smoked\" flavor. The pulled pork is amazing. The beans were a melange of white and kidney beans, with a sauce that had more of a tomato flavor than a molasses or brown sugar one (good choice). The coleslaw is crunchy, light, and cool, and comes with a generous sprinkle of pepper. The sauces are quite good (probably wouldn't stand up to \"real\" Southern BBQ but who cares), with my favorite being the spicy BBQ.

I also tried the lemonade this time around and it's amazing. Definitely homemade (and if it's not, it's just as good), with a bright lemon tartness and not too sweet. You also get enough to last you through a whole meal. 

I'm so glad our food was as good as it was last time, when we got fresh, just out-of-the-foil brisket. My only complaint still sort of stands: I noticed the employees seem to take our plate one item at a time. Because of this, not everything was quite as hot as it could've been because it was out on the counter. However, the last thing to come out was the rolls and my god, having fresh, hot homemade rolls is incredible. So, it's just something to work on and didn't affect the quality of my meal."}
{"text":"I'm not usually into ratings, but it's been a while I wanted to write this review because of my experience... \"Good food, but not so good of service...\" I finally find a BBQ place nearby work to have lunch, began enjoying it the first few times, when I noticed that the service was getting worse each time... One night I decided to have some friends try this place, we were told the place was closed, when it was supposed to be open for another hour and a half... the last time I went was a few days after, I wanted to try their burgers, but was told that the burgers weren't ready... I asked if it was possible to make some (which I would've waited), since I was on my lunch break, I was told No... So, I got up and left, and took my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"As a carnivore, this place feels like home. My first encounter with Le Smoking BBQ was during an Atwater Pokemon Go break. Our waitress was awesome. She totally understood the importance to leave during the middle of our order to go catch a Rhydon that just appeared nearby. We didn't have any trouble coming back to our table and finishing our order afterwards - which was welcomed by a great laugh. 

The food was good enough that I came back another day. I had the beef ribs and that's when I fell in love. Fall-off the bone tender bovine ribs marked with a beautiful dark char, this piece of meat was meant to be devoured like a caveman during the primitive days. Be careful though, you might daydream about the mouthwatering feeling of sinking your teeth into the sinful piece of fat beef ribs for the next few days. Another great thing about this place is the different kinds of condiments that are sitting next to your meal, waiting to drench your BBQ meat and fries.

To all the vegetarians and vegans out there, I won't tell anyone if you sin here."}
{"text":"This was an old, unfinished review that I went into to finish.  Like good 'cue, I guess this review is low and slow!   And Le Smoking has excellent barbecue.

I have been a regular customer at Le Smoking since they opened.   My regular order is two mets and a side, consisting of brisket and chicken breast, along with tomato salad as a side.  But I have been known to dabble in their awesome fries and delicious cornbread.
A few nice things that deserve comments:  Their sauces are the bomb!  The Spicy BBQ sauce in particular is amazing.  The mac & cheese is not for the delicate eater.  It's hearty, cheesy and very comforting. The service is always super-friendly.  So is their customer service: Once we had a glitch and the manager was happy to make things right.
And now I want to go there for lunch.  And dinner."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend on Sunday at 1 pm or so. There was few people at that time. So happy that we didn't need to wait.
The chef/maybe owner and the waitress were nice.
I got a combo with two kinds of meat and a side. I chose smoked chicken and pork rib. As for side, I got tomato salade. It came with a homemade bread. The meat was so gooooooood! The chicken was not dry and the porc wasn't too greasy."}
{"text":"It tooks 30 minutes before we received our food but it was well worth it. Plus we had good service ! Recommand !"}
{"text":"How can you not be attracted to the food truck with the heavenly smell of pork ribs on the grill?

I was attending a show at PDA during the Jazz festival. Attracted by the smell, I decided to grab some food at Le Smoking BBQ: I went with the ribs poutine.

The poutine itself was good. Great julienne fries (think McDonalds in size, but darker and much better), slightly peppery, with fresh curds (obviously) and a sweet gravy. Add a large squirt of their barbecue sauce and it was heaven.

Why the 3 stars then? Because of the ribs. What a disappointment. The meat was dry like the Sahara desert. I think they may have smoked the ribs, grilled them, and kept the deboned meat in a warmer for way too long. As the service was pretty instantaneous, I guess they have prepped a huge stock in advance rather than deboning freshly grilled ribs on the fly.

I would have prefered a slightly longer wait and have moist ribs. I'm sure they would have been good.

If I order from the food truck again I'd try the pulled pork instead.

In short, I think they could earn 4 stars easily, but because of the volume of sales at the Jazz fest, the mass prep may have affected quality."}
{"text":"For the price, it's good value bbq: not the best in Montreal, but it seems like the pitmasters behind the grills have the right basics. I had baked beans, brisket poutine, and a brownie. 

Baked Beans: sweet, tangy, very ketchupy... Mixed in were chunks of homemade smoked sausages that had a nice chew (good texture), but somewhat bland otherwise (I tried a piece of the same sausage from a friend's sausage poutine to make sure it wasn't the ketchup that ruined it). 

Brisket poutine: excellent gravy and chewy cheese curds on crispy fries - my kind of poutine. As for the brisket, it was indeed a good addition to the poutine, but it wouldn't be able to hold its own without a good gravy (it was kind of dry and lacked smokiness). 

Brownie: sooo sweet, it's downright not edible. And the texture is off, it's too mushy. 

BBQ sauces available on the tables: 
- Original: very very sweet. While I know that it may win BBQ contests in eastern canada, that amount of sugar is not something the average customer can tolerate. 

- Spicy: too garlicky, it ruins the spiciness. 

- Coffee: no.

- Mustard: the best sauce at Le Smoking BBQ. Good balance of sweet, mustard spicy, and salty... Too bad it's a mustard sauce rather than a more standard BBQ sauce xD

Reasonable pricing overall, for the quality of food. I'm glad the BBQ scene in Montreal is picking up momentum despite the vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free fad."}

{"text":"I went there about 2 weeks ago for a take out (live 2 mins away) . 
Friendly staff, served right away and atmosphere looked nice. 
Ordered ribs, brisket, and pulled pork and some sides. 
Price was decent given its location. 

Food review - to be honest, I've had better and was not too impressed... Sauce was awesome but all 3 meats were kinda bland and chewy.... Didn't melt in my mouth =(

I still recommend trying this place out though... It might have been one off night."}
{"text":"Monday two for one ribs was more than enough to convince my husband and i to try this place out. We've seen the food truck around town and have tried their pulled pork poutine already. 

So we got there at 6 pm and the restaurant had about 6-7 people already eating their meal. Three staff members and call it a day. We took a look at the menu that was short, simple and straight forward. One of the staff member behind the counter explained to us that it is like a cafeteria style. We sit, we go order at the counter and when the order is ready, they give us a call so we go pick it up at the counter. 

Our order was: 2 for 1 rack of ribs, a brisket, a pickle, homemade buns and coleslaw. Here's my problem. They didn't have ANY ribs ready! It's a 2 for 1 special at diner time and no ribs??????? So the person suggested we take a drink while waiting about 30 minutes for the ribs to be done. We agreed and ordered a beer and a cocktail. The whole thing ended up costing 67$. She somehow forgot about our drinks because i had to ask the other two employees about it before she realized that she had forgotten about it. We ended up having our drinks at the same time as our food! The ribs were generous but dry. The brisket was a really small piece for 8,99$. The coleslaw was oily and the bread... well it came when we were done eating and have asked for it to all of them! For f*^! sake! It wasn't only us that didn't get all our food. A man ordered and payed for his meal that had sausages... They didn't have enough for him! What??? They really need to work on their mise en place and production! I have no words on how annoyed i was! I give this place 2 stars because the cocktail was good and even though the service sucked, i could see that they were really trying! I am glad i tried this place out but i will NOT be coming back here."}
{"text":"Pork ribs yummy with a nice presentation. Nice hearty coleslaw and loved the fresh fries. Feels like a southern BBQ joint ."}
{"text":"La poutine est exellente, bcp de viande et bcp de fromage, le service est tres gentil, il y a juste la déco que je ne trouve de mon gout: theme country."}
