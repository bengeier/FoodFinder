{"text":"This restaurant deserve less than one star, walk in the place was empty, order jerk chicken  plate,the chicken was very dry and hard, the cabbage was very salty and soggy , the only thing good was the plaintains which I had to pay extra for, the small portion was no worth the big bucks, will no be going back"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I had the curry chicken with rice and peas and the potato salad. Loved the plantains.The people are so wonderful as well. I received great service. This is definitely a place I will keep coming back to."}
{"text":"Good food!  Not an extensive menu on the day I went (Saturday late afternoon).  They sold out of Curried chicken, our three choices were Jerk Chicken, Brown Chicken and Curried Goat with sides rice/peas, white rice and cabbage.  Beef patties available for $3 a piece.  Me and my friend ordered the Jerk Chicken with rice/peas and cabbage.  Meat was tender, flavorful.  Just enough spiciness. Authentic Jamaican food.  Small place and food is served in take-home containers. Nothing fancy about the environment.  The owner's daughter was serving us and she was very personable.  Price was $12 or $10 each, did not include beverages.  Parking in the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for a meal tonight having a huge craving for jerk chicken only to find out they closed early. Granted I was here almost 45 minutes before closing and I even called and no answer. So there's that...."}
{"text":"Living here for over 8 years and having tried just about every Jamaican place there is, finally Jerk Chicken that I can not enjoy but look forward to going back. I live in Awahatukee, but will gladly make the trip. The food was tasteful and balanced. The rice and peas were seasoned and had levels of flavor. There was not much cabbage and what was in the container seemed to be the ends of the head. It's pricey so won't be going there too regularly. The staff was friendly and personable. Not easy to find using my GPS, but was given directions and parked up the street. Go check it out."}
{"text":"Finally made it here and I was amazed. The jerk chicken was fantastic and the curry goat was delicious. The staff was friendly and recommended the kola champagne soda and I was not disappointed. They even sold us a bottle of the hot sauce. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My friend  recommended  the oxtail. We got there at 5.30 and the food was all on a steam table. We got the stew chicken.  But we got a lot of chicken  with a lot of chicken  bones . There should  mot be serving remnants.  The rice and peas were ok but the cabbage was way overcooked.  We tried the oxtail . These were cut in very small pieces and was also overcooked.  The lady who served us was not very friendly.  I think she  wanted to go home ."}
{"text":"I need some jerk chicken. Tried other Jamaican spots in the Phoenix area & nothing doing me service. This one does. Small mom & pop restaurant, parking is a lil crazy in the back left. Worth it though in my opinion."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the chef does an outstanding job. The only problem is that it is too pricey. I got smothered ox tails, rice and peas and a beef patty with a mango drink for like $21! It was really good food, but that's too much for a lunch and the portions were beyond fair. No one wants to blow $20+ on a plate lunch to go."}
{"text":"I don't know what these other people are talking about...I go to the Caribbean Marketplace on 19th at least 2 times during the work week, they're always open and the food is AMAZING. I get the Brown Stewed Chicken and is so Damn good. The oxtails & jerk combo is also pretty good especially with the extra jerk sauce. If you're in Phoenix and love Caribbean food definitely go to Caribbean Marketplace."}
{"text":"WoW, WoW, WoW. When you are looking for Caribbean food, Caribbean Marketplace Grill is the spot to come and enjoy authentic Caribbean food. The flavors, the herbs and the amount of food you get is all amazing. I live in Orlando Florida. Everywhere I go and all the states I have been too. I can not find what I get from Caribbean Marketplace Grill. I would travel however far I need too just to get the best Caribbean food in Phoenix Arizona. Go, and try it for yourself. You will see and taste some unbelievable flavor. I travel for work. I get to taste a lot of different food from all over the USA, I am a chef on the side,  I always look for great food. Authentic food. I am in Tucson Arizona right now and this Monday before I head back to Orlando after hurricane Irma ends, I will do the two hour drive just to get some great food. I suggest you do the same. Spread the word. Many blessings over this restaurant."}
{"text":"Having recently moved from NY, and being of Jamaican descent, I'm on the hunt for a restaurant that will satisfy my craving when I need a taste of home and don't feel like cooking.  Sadly, I didn't find it at Caribbean Marketplace grill.   I visited this establishment on a Saturday afternoon and ordered the curried chicken.  By this time the white rice and cabbage, staples that usually accompany curried chicken were sold out (not sure why they couldn't have just made a small pot of white rice - it doesn't take that long).  My order was to go yet I had to wait almost 20 minutes for my order.  It didn't help much when I heard the man behind the counter say the dumplings were burned - that's a first!  The chicken was already prepared as was the rice so I'm not sure what caused the delay.   It tasted just ok.  The flavor was there, but something was missing that I couldn't put my finger on.  Or maybe it was the rice and peas which isn't the best accompaniment with curried chicken.  I decided to go next door to see what was sold in the marketplace.   Slim pickings considering it was supposed to be a grocery store, and the prices were significantly higher than what I'm used to.  It's doubtful that I will return and until I find some decent Jamaican food, I'll make own."}
{"text":"Recently moved here from California, was searching everywhere for some amazing Jamaican food and found this place!! I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"So glad I found this place and it's right down the street from my house. Love the jerk with the rice and beans and cabbage. I'm from the East Coast and have been looking for some good Caribbean food and this is a really great spot."}
{"text":"Best Caribbean food since I've been in Queens! Great service as well, you should definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"I ordered the stewed chicken. I have a good friend who makes it, and honestly, the restaurant was good. But something was missing.. I believe it was tomatoe? Idk. It wasn't as good as I would've hoped. It needed some sauce. If I order again, I'll make sure to ask for hero sauce on the side. Service was nice and speedy."}
{"text":"This place is really delicious. Check it out, parking in back. Family food opportunity, jerk chicken is great."}
{"text":"This is my second time getting food from this place. The complaint I had the first time was that the portions seemed small for the price. That was so long ago that I can't remember if it's improved, but the portion seemed small again. This time it seems I got day old chicken that needed to unload at the end of the day because the jerk chicken I bought was over cooked and EXTREMELY tough. I think I'm done now. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"They are never open at the time that they are supposed to be.  The food is not good, now that it has new owners. Food lacks the authentic taste that it used to have. Rice and jerk sauce has been changed from the original recipe so now the jerk sauce is sweet.   Eeeew!!! They now don't even close on time. Always closing hours early now.  With that being said.  Just find another Jamaican restaurant because this one is not worth it or the expensive prices for terrible food. Faking Jamaican!"}
{"text":"This location used to be the Jerk Hut Jamaican Grille, but has a new owner.

I've been looking for some Caribbean food that met the standards of back home (NJ/NY). A coworker of mine from NY by way of Jamaica told me about this precious gem: Caribbean Marketplace Grill! 

NOTE: I've only experienced their take out and it has been 100000% BOMB! I was told Dinning-In was waay better! **Insert Excitement Emoji

My first visit was to the location on Northern which is their first location. I ordered the Oxtails with beans and rice, cabbage, plantains, and side salad. YO, I fail in love at first bite! The entire dish (salad included) was full of flavor, the Oxtail tender and juicy, the plantains sweet and all cooked to perfection. After having my first fix, I needed more. Being that I live in Laveen that's not the fastest drive for take-out, but while there the young lady that assisted me let me know about their location on 19th Ave and Indian School. I told her, \"I'll visit you all soon\"... I'm sure most customers say that. However, at the time I was thinking \"Depending on how good this meal is.\" Boy two days later I was at that 19th Ave location and all I could think of was JERK CHICKEN. Listen, everyone claims to have had the best jerk chicken, knows someone that makes it, or this or that restaurant makes it. I'm here to tell you that this is the best Jerk Chicken that I have had since moving to AZ 15 years ago. 

If you don't visit another spot all year (2016), you need to go check them out."}
