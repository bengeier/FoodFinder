{"text":"We stayed at a nearby hotel and read the yelp reviews and gave delivery a go.  The food was tasty.  We ordered beef fried rice, chicken broccoli, and beef noodles.  The person who took our order, delivered as well, and he was extremely friendly.  We would go back if we were in the neighborhood.

The only thing was that we ordered \"beef lo mein\", which in Cantonese terms is usually boiled noodles with beef and soup on the side; however, not sure if he heard us wrong, but we got beef hor fun (stir fried flat rice noodles) instead.  It still tasted good but not exactly what we expected.   Perhaps just a mistake?"}
{"text":"Decent canadian Chinese delivery.  You save 10% if paying cash.  Have been going here both at hopedale and before on lakeshore- I heard one of the owners bought them out.   Not quiet as good as before but great service.  They forgot a dish in the delivery and had a fresh one to the house in 10 mins.  
The crispy honey ginger beef is great. Chicken balls are soso.  Decent price and it beats cooking!"}
{"text":"We have been customers of the original Bronte Chinese food for 12 years, first location on lakeshore, second at hopdale mall, we heard they moved back to lakeshore, we went today, what a disaster!! Chicken balls rock hard, general tso chicken with sweet and sour?!? Spring rolls with minimal veggies, schezuan beef in a sweet sauce? There is no way this is bronte chinese, even though the sign says so, this location was always a chinese restaurant, i think they bought the name,
Stay away!"}
{"text":"Tried takeout for the first time and was quite satisfied. Good Canadian style Chinese food and an excellent combo for one for cheap. Fresh and flavourful."}
{"text":"This is our go-to spot for Chinese takeout. In true Chinese takeout fashion we want a bit of everything, end up spending well over $100 and live off Chinese food for days. 

This is your typical North American style Chinese takeout and it does not disappoint. We always get dry ginger beef (my favourite), steak with black pepper sauce, lemon chicken, sesame chicken, chicken fried rice, Cantonese chow mein and vegetable low mein. Honestly, we could feed an army, but it is so good!

The staff are always friendly and the order is always ready quickly. We always pick up and pay in cash so we get the 10% discount."}
{"text":"One word: diarrhea. Very greasy not quality and even the egg roll sucked. How the fuck does a Chinese place have shit egg rolls?"}
{"text":"Ordered Chinese food delivered to my hotel from this well-respected local restaurant. Chicken balls, excellent. Egg rolls a little tired.  Veggie dish (broccoli and mushrooms) excellent -- fresh, beautifully cooked. Chicken fried rice fresh and tasty.  Overall, very, very good Canadian-Cantonese food!  I asked for plates and cutlery for two, extra sauces and all was just as I ordered.  Thank you!"}
