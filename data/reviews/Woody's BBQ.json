{"text":"Do not go here!! The servers don't know about anything on the menu and the food tastes like plastic. I have never had worse food."}
{"text":"Such a great place ! Excellent atmosphere and amazing food ! Best ribs in town !"}
{"text":"I strolled into this spot with a friend craving some BBQ meat.  I was told the brisket wasn't quite ready and would be another 15 minutes in the smoker.  No problem.  Corn nuggets to start while we wait.  They were okay; nothing special.  When the brisket came out, I was a bit disappointed.  It was overcooked & tough.  If you have access to a smoker and still can't make a tender and delicious brisket, you should not be in a kitchen.    I noticed shortly thereafter that it was also karaoke that day.  Oh no.  There needs to be a rule preventing untalented people from singing in public.  I tried to focus on the food while my ears were being infected by screeching garbage from women that are convinced they should be singers.  The service was okay, but not excellent.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"The service and food we're both terrible.  I had the catfish and it was bland at best. The brisket was fatty and had no flavor. I was very disappointed with woodys."}
