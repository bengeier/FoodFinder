{"text":"Oh man, the interior of this place needs a Gordon Ramsay make over.  It kind of looks more like an office rather than restaurant.  I ordered take out, and the food was surprisingly delicious.  Bhuna gosht and Daal masala were great with the garlic naan.  The basmati rice (ordered seperately) was also very flavorful.  If anything, the lamb was slightly overpriced for the portion.  This place needs more customers!! Gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Dined on July 3rd, 2012

+ Delicious made-to-order food
+ Dirt cheap, as compared to other Indian restaurants in the area
+ Clean restrooms
+ Spacious dining tables. You will be glad when you have ordered multiple items
+ The host was fluent in English

- Service is slow, probably because the food is cooked to order
- The place is HOT! I do not know why the AC was not working

We dined here on a sweltering Vegas evening. The place was hot but was offset with good quality food, easy on spices and oil. I found the food to be under-salted but that is any day better than being served over-salted food. 

We ordered the following:
- Chicken Curry - Best of the lot. Enough for two people
- Malai Kofta - Easy on the cream and very delicious. Enough for two people
- Goat Biriyani - Low on oil, wish it had a little more salt to begin with
- Naan - Soft and delicious
- Rotis - Give it a miss...was almost as crunchy as a poppadom

They ran out of ice and we had to wait, while the owner had to rush out to get the ice. By the time he came back, we had paid and were about to leave. He explained the situation and apologized for the delay and thanked us for visiting Shalimar. Nice guy."}
{"text":"This was my third visit from New Jersey and have always found great food quality. Their kababs are amazing! 
Naan's are excellent and goat Karahi was fantastic.
Chana dal was great too!

It's not high end restaurant but food is. If they can improve the ambience and service, business will flourish more."}
{"text":"Food not spicy at all, horrible slow service, did not feel welcome at all, rude employee! overpriced, overall an experience no one should ever have!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Perfect service! Food is fresh! I strongly recommend coming here. For sure coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Utterly disappointed with the food and service at this location.
We had Shalimar food in Bay area and expected the same.

The food was awful, quantity was bare minimum.
The service was terrible and the cleanliness is un-describable."}
{"text":"If you're vegetarian this place is not for you.   The food sucks.  I can make better veg byrani and paneer tikka masala at home.   I gave one star for naan roti.  Least they got that correct. I would not come here again.   I was expecting good food similar to Shalimar in northern California."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Shalimar Bay Area. I was visitig vegas and craving for pakistani food. I searched and learn that Shalimar has branch in Las Vegas. I called the guys to check if this is original Shalimar. Manager was a nice guy and he talk me into trying Nihari at his restaurant and if we doesnot like the food no need to pay. Any how we end up trying the Nihari and it was very good. Overall service was good and nice clean retaurant. Reasonable price.

I recommed tourist to try this place and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"We order Chicken Tikka Masala, Nihari, Goat Biriyani and Chikken leg in BBQ. Food was very authentic and delicious. Excellent service. Our server was very friendly. I highly recommend this place to all food lovers."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good Indian food in Vegas that is not pretentious, this is definitely a great bet.  The chicken tikka and nan are fantastic.  I haven't had a chance to try anything else yet but I will definitely be coming back and will update my review."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and very authentic and reminds me of the food my aunties made for me growing up.  To me, it is hands down the best Pakistani/Indian/South Asian food in town.  However, I do have to agree with other reviewers about the interior, but I always get carry out and enjoy all of their delicious dishes in the comfort of my home."}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat here as I love indian/pakistani food and I live right up the street . I placed a phone order waited 20 min to pick up and not only was the guy at the front rude to me over the phone, but also in person. I paid for my order took it to my car and opened the containers and had a huge amount of oil floating on top and mixed in the chicken tikka masala( 6 cubes of sour tasting chicken cubes) and i tried pouring off the oil which didn't work. It was salty and greasy. Huge helping of rice though . Very disappointed $15.00. I gave them another  chance 2 weeks later and  I ordred some ground beef stew( i forgot the name) and tandoori chicken and rice. The same thing. The ground beef was floating in oil and very, very salty and drove my blood pressure up. Huge amount of rice and the ckicken was well cooked, but bland. $21.00. I'm done with this place. No wonder it's empty."}
{"text":"This place was dirty and they barely spoke English. The food was too oily and they make you buy a drink. No iced water. They want you to buy bottled water. This place sucks!! I would not come back."}
{"text":"On our one week visit to vegas we found this place and simply loved It. They serve Very delicious food out of what we order chicken tikka masala, lamb biriyani, goat Karahi and kebabs were mouth watering dishes."}
{"text":"I don't know what the other negative reviews are talking about. This place is AWESOME!!! The food is delicious and the employees are the best! I try to come at least once a week. 

Try the Murghi Korma Shahi, Chicken Biryani and Naan. It's the best!!!

Followed up with some Masala Tea to cap it off  MMMMMM nothing better in Vegas.

The prices are very reasonable. I can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"This was probably the worse experience I have ever had at a Pakistani/Indian restaurant. There was one person there running the front. He didn't speak English. We were lost for about an hour and I had to call him three or more times because I just did not understand a word he said. I only picked up 'food maxx' and went to two different ones until I found it.  Ordering was not any easier. We just werent able to communicate properly. The food wasn't bad but defiantly could have been better. There was no complementary chutney, tea or anything. we asked for some, it was brought to us and then when receiving the reciept we realized we were charged for literally everything. The guy even miscounted the tea and charged us more than we had. We had asked for some water. The guy told us to get it ourselves. My sister told him, he's the waiter, he's supposed to bring us water. He laughed and went inside and brought us water. The guy gave us a hard time with everything we asked for until we just got up and got it ourselves with things such as napkins. They even had items on their menu that they didn't have.It was just a bad experience all together. Definitely don't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I lean more toward 3.5/5, but that's not an option.

The food is very tasty here. I have been three times and had a goat curry, a lamb entree, and the chicken tikka masala. The first two were excellent but the chicken masala was a bit dry. The meats are lean and tasty and the sauces seem to be composed with particular care. They feel somehow authentic rather than generic. 

Both the rice and the naan are also very good, and rice in particular is generously portioned. 

Prices are about $2 less than than is standard for Indian food of this quality. (I'm comparing Shalimar only to Indian rather than to Pakistani restaurants because I have little experience of the latter).

The big downside here is the decor, which is terrible. It starts on the outside, with the most inelegant marquee-style sign I can remember seeing outside a good restaurant. The interior is uniformly dull, cheap tables, plastic tablecloths, bland Western landscape art on the walls that has no relation to the ethnicity of the cuisine. It reminded me of a dentist's office, and not an upscale one. Another reviewer compared it to a laundromat.  The lack of style even extends to the menus themselves.

The restaurant is operated by a family and they seem quite appreciative and friendly toward their customers, unlike most Indian restaurants where the service is rather chilly. 

I think with a thorough interior remodel Shalimar would be equivalent to a fairly upscale Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place five stars for the food!  This is truly excellent Pakistani cuisine.  And the prices are great (for example, several $5.95 veg entrees).  Our party of four ordered chicken tikka masala that was spicy and had a thick gravy - we cleaned that up!  The dal masala was differently made than we've ever had in that the lentils were whole instead of pureed.  It made a very nice texture, plus the flavor was gooood!   We also ordered eggplant and a mixed veg dish - both had hearty chunks of vegetable and were nicely spiced.  Oh and the garlic naan was so hard to stop eating!   I think this is a family owned place, but we didn't feel too much love from anyone..  the decor of the place is really simple and drab too (but clean).  But if you just close your eyes and concentrate on the food, I think you'll be in masala heaven!  :)"}
{"text":"By far one of the most authentic place in Vegas I have always come here for the chicken tikka masala since it was the best I found out of 13 Indian restaurants that i had tried I also regularly bring friends to the enjoy this authentic Indian cuisine"}
{"text":"Best chicken in town love this place I eat here about twice a week definitely recommend it to all my friends =)"}
{"text":"There are 2 things I look for here in Vegas,  1- I'm always on the look out for restaurants that are NOT attached to a casino. And 2nd- the quality of the food (which believe it or not - is very hard to find in Las Vegas).  I've had so many bad meals at restaurants here.  
I found this place the other day and it was so nice to have some real good ethnic food.  
I will definitely be back as there is a whole menu of items to try!"}
{"text":"Very good food and fresh made 
Fast service and reasonable  price
Recommend every one should visit"}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS and the staff make you feel like family! The garlic naan is sooo yummy :-)"}
{"text":"There Indian food is so so delicious here. I get the yellow chicken curry. Its the best ever. There garlic naan bread is allways fresh. I don't get over there to often because it's in my old neighborhood but when I'm over there I allways go. Check it out it tastes great"}
{"text":"If you like India/Pakistani food this is an absolute must try for the Vegas area. They have a great menu and awesome Naan. They offer different types of Naan such as Garlic & onion. The place is ran by a husband and wife who are really nice and keep the place clean and the service attentive. This place is also great for vegetarians. They have great lamb dishes as well. I always order the Mango Lassi to drink and it's delicious."}
{"text":"Definitely over priced they charge $3.50 for single Seekh Kabab Murgh, the price listed online is different than the price listed in store.m, I am sure there's regulations in place in US that don't allow this. Update the site or respect the lower price 
 
Raita is watery least they could do is make it not watery when they are charging you for it, pretty much an insult to Raita 

Didn't try the naan but yes the Roti is horrible. Hard and overly crisp.

Chicken tikka masala isn't at all like it should be. Also you are a restaurant in America so go easy on the oil. 

All in all I will only go back for the overly priced Seekh Kabab It's the only dish that tastes decent. 

Till I find another spot. 

Also not the place to go if you care about customer service, because they definitely will not be giving you any."}
{"text":"Very good quality food, made fresh to order and extremely affordable.    Rather small inside, but personal and laid back.    The garlic naan and mango lessi were extremely good, and we really enjoyed the Biryani, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Bangab Bharta (eggplant).    

In the corner of a strip mall, so it is a little hard to find, but definitely worth the effort for authentic food at great prices."}
{"text":"We went in to eat seekh kabob and naan and they said they are out of beef seekh kabob because it is too hot to have beef seekh kabob. We ordered chicken seekh kabob and they were overcooked. Naan were overcooked also and when we asked they said he cooked them in butter. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is legit Indian/Pakistani food_ they use the clay oven and all. The food is ALWAYS über tasty! My only complaint is that EVERYTHING is ala carte (and this seems to be the new standard practice for Indian restaurants, WTF?!)! Even so the portions are still well worth the price. I usually get Chicken Tikka Masala, basmati rice and garlic naan which comes to just a little over $15 and is the perfect amount for two people. Oh and they have five types of naan bread mostly in the $2.50 range."}
{"text":"Sketchy place with Sketchy food and they over charge you for food so make sure you check your bills! ! When you order chicken make sure it's chicken because you'll find random bones in there and the owners don't own up to their actions. Instead of a sorry they bullshit and tell you it's chicken when it isn't and its bones from God knows what kind of meat.  I won't be coming here again and supporting these people who clearly don't know wtf customer service is and don't own up to their actions."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian & Pakistani food! Best meal I have had in Vegas and also the most well priced. A bit off the strip but definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I eat here frequently.  I really like the lamb dishes.  Most everything has been excellent. Though I'm not too crazy about their goat meals.  But my roommate loves it   It really is a great change when you want something different"}
{"text":"Pathetic place to be. If u like to spoil the taste buds and ur stay in Vegas then try this out. I would recommend to stay hungry than going to this place. Served rotten food."}
{"text":"Beyond disappointing. 
Bad service. Bad food. Bad ambiance. 

I'd rather eat a safe choice Filet-o-Fish than come here for pricey Halal food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant for Northern Indian and Pakistani food. You'll feel all the comfort and hospitality you'd expect when visiting a great friend! If you're like me I love it hot, just don't say HOT, HOT HOT! My friends and family like everything mild. The Nihari and Murgh are off the hook! The homemade Naan... mmmmmmm...."}
{"text":"WAY too much vegetable oil in the curry & the chicken was like rubber. The dish came out rather tepid as well (not hot thru). Even the basmati rice was greasy and seemed rather old. The curry set me back $11 plus $3 for the rice. Also, I asked for a cup of water, was brought a bottle of water and was charged for it (this left a bad taste in my now oily mouth). There was nobody in the place. Still waiting on the check, which is giving me ample time to write this. Very disappointed, as this is the closest Indian food to my house. Won't be back. Bummer."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! I would definitely suggest trying this place, I've had many Indian food experiences and this is one of the best!"}
{"text":"This place sucked. The food wasnt that good. Not alot of seasoning and most of the meat was tough. The atmosphere is horrible. Harsh flourscent lighting , shoe string budget tables and chairs with a tv playing some obnoxious infomercial throughout my whole meal. Usually when you order nan bread it comes with some kind of awesome chutney but they brough us this watery liquid shit in a squeeze bottle that was supposed to be chutney. Shit squirted out like water and was ice cold. Overpriced at $10 per item. They served you hot tea in a fucking styrofoam cup in a place thats supposed to be a resteruant not a hot dog stand. Garbage."}
{"text":"Okay, this restaurant is next to the salon I work at, and i have to say I was hesitant to go in because of the way it looks. It's not dirty at all, but it's very plain...from what I've been told they just opened this place earlier this year. 

Had the food and it was pretty darn good! I ordered the Kabli Channa, Chicken Tikka Masala and the Naan bread. Yum. Yum. Yum. The prices are TOTALLY affordable. LOVES!"}
{"text":"My husband (Mike \"Vegas Aussie\" P.) wanted to give Shalimar 2.5 stars and was nice enough to bump it to three. I'll even things out and take Yelp's \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" definition of the two star rating to heart and leave them with the pair.

Mike covered most of the important points in his review, but I can add a little from the usual vegetarian and Somewhat Fussy Wife(tm) angles.

The vegetarian menu (I uploaded a blurry photo) does have several items, although I think other Indian restaurants in town offer as many dishes with perhaps more variety. I may just feel this way because the paneer dishes were palak, masala, and muttar. That's spinach, tomato, and more tomato, so no indulgent buttery option like a shahi paneer or a paneer makhani, what I usually go for when having Indian food somewhere other than a buffet.

In addition to Mike's chicken tikka masala, we ordered both the paneer muttar and the paneer masala - one for me and one to share - thinking that at the very reasonable prices Shalimar offers, we ought to go full-on into feasting mode. Alas, only the masala was brought out. We were glad by then, though. We were the only people inside on this Saturday night, on display as the otherwise friendly gentleman playing host and server often watched us from the other side of the room. The notions of lingering and savouring had evaporated before the last crunch of papad. (As Mike noted, these tasted the same as the ones we get at Rani's and nuke up for snacks.)

Also, again as Mike said, we were nursing our semi-cold bottles of Kroger water, probably purchased from Food for Less next door, and another dish would've meant ordering another two dollars' worth of tepid H20. I don't object to paying for bottled water, but c'mon, Crystal Geyser is the same price and has a prettier label! I kid a little, but I love refreshing cold water with my Indian, and the barely cold plastic bottles were at odds with this preference, if not with the burgundy tablecloths. (Then again, our tablecloth was dirty, so maybe the sight of plastic empties was meant to be an thematic juxtaposition.) I also raise an eyebrow at a restaurant not offering tap water: are you being unattractively chintzy, Shalimar, or is there a plumbing issue I don't want to know about? 

Suggestion: serve the water bottles in an ice bucket and sell bucket refills at half price. (You already made the money back on a 24-pack from next door after you sold the first two bottles, right?)  Or keep them the same price, just at least keep them cold and keep them coming.

The naan was not of the soft sort that I usually go gaga over, but we both enjoyed it. I found it pleasantly chewy without that chewiness going on and on and on beyond reason.

Rice does not come with the dishes - you choose what you want separately. We shared Shalimar Chawal for $2.50. Mike liked it, but I thought it tasted like plain rice and had no smell, not even that basic (and heavenly) Basmati fragrance. You do get a pile of it, though.

After we ordered, I realized that we weren't asked how we would like with the dishes - mild, medium, or hot. The paneer masala was medium heat, which luckily is how I like it, but the sauce lacked subtlety. I felt like the chilis were a little harsh against the other spices, so instead of layers of tastes it was just a general sense of tomatoes + unspecified spice + heat. For the price, maybe that's okay. Then again, it still seemed a little below the par of buffet sauces.

The paneer itself was nice. To keep riding the quibble horse, I think they should make the pieces a little smaller. Sure, you can just chop them with your fork, but then you don't have all of those nice cooked edges and the taste can get a little dry. (And then you have to do fancy math to figure out if it's okay to ration a sip of Kroger water.)

My husband's review mentions that the condiments served with the papad came in squeeze bottles. (I've also uploaded a photo of this.) He couldn't identify the white-ish one, but I think it was watered-down raita. There was definitely a whiff of cucumber to it. Too bad my shirt is in the washer at the moment or I'd go give it another sniff. Yes, both it and the brown-ish stuff in the other bottle (probably tamarind?) were very watery. I gave up trying to make a little well on my plate and tried squeezing it onto the papad like I was dressing a hot dog. And now you know why I'm doing laundry on Saturday night. D'oh!

Pros: Slightly cheaper prices than other places, nice people.

Cons: Largely unremarkable food, slightly sad (and slightly smelly) atmosphere, warmish water woes.

To-go boxes are available, but we decided not to leave our leftovers, even the naan. Perhaps Shalimar has some stand-out dish that sets them apart, but since we have those two dollars that we didn't spend on a second round of water, I think next time we'll pay a little more for a better experience elsewhere."}
{"text":"Amazing Pakistani food. Best chicken kabob i have ever eaten in my life! be careful its spicy."}
{"text":"Really good food, delicious lamb buryani, it is the best authentic pakistani food in las vegas affordable menu, tried the mango lassi, it was different, definetly will be back again."}
{"text":"Had goat biryani and chicken tikka karahi. I have to say both were tasteless. Both seemed to be old as it were taken out of the refrigerator and warmed it up in microwave. Serving portions were small. There were customers that were waiting for more than 35 mins for their food.

Not recommended.."}
{"text":"I keep trying to convince myself that this place is appealing, because sometimes the food is great. But the current environs are grimy, crusty, and damn it - the bathroom is kind of gross. Just not a good dining experience. Get your food to go if you choose to eat it. The energy in this place is depressing, and the contractor-grade fluorescent lights only accentuate the details at night.

Some dishes are excellent still: Eggplant Masala, Mili Juli, Mixed Vegetable Curry, Yellow Dal, Chicken Tikka Masala."}
{"text":"For authenticity, flavor, & value this place can't be beat. The atmosphere is very plain but if you want to treat your taste buds, eat here. Very sparse on ambiance but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"My Indian friend insisted on taking me and our mutual friend here for some \"authentic\" Indian food for dinner one night.  

He ordered everything for us: goat biryani, goat karahi, chicken tikka masala, naan, and mango lassi (x3).  I personally do not enjoy eating goat because I find it to be too tough and at times \"gamey\" so I wasn't looking forward to our meal!  Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised by the goat karahi- it was tender and pretty tasty!  The chicken, however, was dry, tough, and the sauce was gritty.  The biryani was just alright.  

This place is bone-in, if that matters to you.  Sometimes I prefer places without because I just hate biting down on gristle or little pieces of bone, but I know the bones add more flavor.  Also, the naan was just eh.  I love a good fluffly naan, but this one was hard on one side and not so fluffy (not a great description, but what counts is that it wasn't the same).

This place is okay, but I don't think I'll go out of my way to visit again.  Maybe I can't handle \"authentic\" Indian food haha.  I'm still searching for the \"perfect\" Indian restaurant in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Average Indian food. I've had a lot of Indian food and this is probably one of my weakest experiences ever.  This place is in a little strip mall in the Food 4 Less shopping center. The service was below average at best and I had to call a guy over a couple of times just to order and for the check. Other than that and the delivery of my order these guys never came back. They were out of chicken breast. I ordered the Korma which was decent but two legs with hardly any meat - it might as well have been a vegetarian dish.  Also, the prices are not that great. As I'm not from Vegas maybe this is inexpensive compared to others. $9.99 for dish, $3 for rice, $2.50 for garlic naan, $1 for bottle of water (not explained that it was additional charge - I just ordered water).   Upon leaving the host didn't even look up as i walked out. I visit Vegas frequently but can say that Shalimar will not be on a planned stop in the future.  There are many other good options."}
{"text":"I searched all over Vegas for a very good Indian Restaurant. Finally i found this place.
The Best Biriyani is Las Vegas. 
Best Indian Curries in Las Vegas.
Best Indian Bread in Las Vegas.

Cons:
Poor Service.
Unfortunately Server's don't Speak Good English. 
Typical Indian/Pakistani social behavior. (More Casual). Westerners may find it uneasy.
Owner will feel more comfortable if you know Hindi :-)"}
{"text":"Pathetic service, smelly restaurant, bland food which is not even half its price. Food was stale and totally different dishes had same curry in them. Microwaved bread."}
{"text":"Ate here with some friends unfortunately when I went they had ran out of beef that night but overall the food was good and I don't like this type of food I hate it but I wouldn't mind eating here again"}
{"text":"Total orgasm.  Best indian pakistani food.  it's a whole in the wall and the owners run the place.  its not the best service but you dont go to a hole in a wall for luxury service.  food is on point.  We ordered the chicken masala and a lamb dish, garlic naan and a mixed vegetable dish.  Out of this world.  I miss you Shalimar:)"}
{"text":"Best vegetable biryani in town. The daal, the garlic naan, the mango lassi, the aloo palak methi, the aloo gobi, it goes on. Sooo good!

I've never eaten here inside, but I used to get delivery when they had it. Now I'll drive from the NW when I get a hankering.

This little hole in the wall is the bomb & I always feel nourished after eating this food. Comforting & pretty healthy, too. It feels so \"homecooked\".

Please never change!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. we got their at 9 20 pm...closing time was 10pm..they said they could not serve us. the short ugly guy said..we could order to go..so we said ok..we will do that. then he said..we could only order one dish!! i walked out!"}
{"text":"The food isn't bad but it isn't great either. Very mediocre quality. This place could be better if the service is good but that too is lacking. I think the owners son is running the show here and he doesn't smile. Ever. Plus he's not attentive to the customers needs. He kept going to sit behind the desk where we couldn't even see him. Since the Pakistani food in vegas is scarce, this place is able to run. 

Dear Salman, it won't kill you to smile once in a while."}
{"text":"Let's face it, Pakistani and Indian people are not the cleanest of cultures. I don't mean to be unkind but it is the truth. Typically they do not keep their restaurants clean. I would like to know if this is the same owner as the Shalimar that used to be on Paradise Rd. next to Ruth's Chris Steak House? That Shalimar location closed many years ago and was absolutely the best.   I HAVE NEVER EATEN HERE"}
{"text":"I decided today to stop in for lunch. I actually was headed somewhere else but couldn't find it. So I remembered that this restaurant was open do I went there. I ordered the Garlic nuun, chicken biryanis and another chicken dish. It was amazing. They treated me like royalty. Service was excellent. I was a 20 minute drive from my home but it was worth every minute. I made sure I ordered enough for my dinner tonight. Kinda like a 2 for 1 deal."}
{"text":"Place is little old may be thats the reason most people get negative feelings before they try the food. Only thing me and my family care about the quality and most vegas indian restaurant dont have modern decorations. They all look indian to me.. But this place as much as i want to give them 4star, taste of their food change my mind to 5. Love their Goat (mutton) Biriani and Lamb vidaloo. I know even you turn on the air condition in vegas, most places still hot inside and this place has the same problem. we always try this place."}
{"text":"I was shocked that we were the only people in the place on a Saturday night. The food was better than average and the price is great. The decor looks a bit like a dive, but don't be deterred. If you want good value, this is a good place with no lines!"}
{"text":"Got the mixed veg and naan and were great.  Maybe bad timing because a few times the other veg dishes weren't available.  Friendly service!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! One of the best Indian food experiences that I have had in USA. It's not a typical restaurant experience. Don't go expecting a snazzy ambiance or great service. They are a small operation in a dusty strip mall but man, do they deliver with the food!

Had the Chicken Karahi, Chicken biryani and the Lamb. Really good, home style Indian food."}
{"text":"We tried this place on a whim and thank goodness we did. The food was amazing with big portion sizes, flavorful and correctly priced. Some of the best Indian food I've had. My only complaint is that rice isn't included in the price of a curry dish"}
{"text":"Shalimar has great food and has never disappointed me. I visit Vegas regularly and always go to Shalimar. Their chicken seekh kabob are excellent and so is chicken jalfrazi. They have great tarka daal and saagh chicken. I recommend Shalimar for authentic Pakistani food."}
{"text":"Wow! We are so happy to live in an area where we are so close we can walk to restaurants, stores and other services. Having lived in New Delhi for 3 years, I have wanted to try Shalimar and today we decided to go have lunch. It earned a solid 4 based on our first lunch experience.
We were greeted graciously by a gentleman obviously only just opening up for the day at almost 12. We were welcomed and took our menus to enjoy reading about the entrees. We had to dive in with garlic naan, raita, chicken tikka masala and a goat karahi.  My tough reviewer husband was thrilled with his meal and right away, between impassioned gestures and bites, claimed this is a full 4!! He never does this. I liked the spiciness of the goat and the tenderness of the chicken, for if you know Indian food it can be at times, less so.
Raita and garlic naan were perfect! We did agree to wait a bit as the kitchen was opening but once the staff were sending out food, it was hot and quick.
There were other gentlemen in the restaurant also diving in to some great looking meals. The fact we can walk over here and we now know there is Indian food in our neighborhood makes us very happy!
When you eat in an Indian/Pakistani restaurant sometimes you see authentically basic surroundings. It is not going to resemble a big fancy place on the Strip. I felt immediately comforted by the cleanliness and the photos of landmarks in India and Pakistan. I am very pleased that we now have plenty to do exploring more of their delicious meals."}
{"text":"Going to have to buck the Yelp trend a bit here and rate this one 2.5 stars overall.

Others have commented about the lack of ambiance here and I'll have to agree. The restaurant is very plain and we went our tablecloth was a bit dirty and there was a vaguely unpleasant smell in the air. The smell was probably just an unfortunate combination of spices and foods from the kitchen, but this could really do with being closed off from the serving area, not only to prevent a medley of odors, but so the diner isn't deafened by clattering of pots and pans and so on.

I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, garlic naan, pappadums, the basmati rice, and water for my beverage.  Instead of the usual Indian restaurant theme of refreshingly iced water topped up the second I sip from my glass, I was surprised to be presented with a single bottle of Kroger water which I had to sip sparingly lest I have to shell out another dollar for another.

The pappadums were OK, but unremarkable, not unlike the pre-made ones you get from Indian grocers and then stick in the microwave for 45 seconds. Instead of the usual bowls of mint or cilantro chutney and tamarind chutney these came accompanied by a couple of roadhouse diner style squeeze bottles filled with some sort of condiments. Both were extremely runny, almost a water consistency, one seemed to taste vaguely of tamarind and I couldn't identify the other.

My Garlic naan was the highlight of my meal and had that certain mix of denseness and crispness that's the hallmark of a good garlic naan.

The rice was pretty good also, cooked with saffron and ghee and very plentiful for just a couple of bucks.

The main meal, my Chicken Tikka Masala was just ok - the chicken was of good quality and well cooked, but the sauce lacked a certain deft touch and was a little aggressive as the spices didn't all blend together quite how I like. I'd be very happy if I had cooked this up myself at home, but it's a notch below what I expect at a restaurant.

The people running this place were very friendly, but it was a rather odd experience. At around 8PM we were the only people in the restaurant and it was a little strange and awkward having the guy sitting there in the tiny restaurant 15 feet from us while we ate.

 One thing in Shalimar's favour is the prices - they are very decent. We didn't hold back on breads and rice and things and our entire meal for two (including bottled water) came to just over $25.

This is the sort of place I could imagine myself coming to regularly for a cheap lunch if I worked in the area and was limited in where I could travel on my lunch break. The food is good enough and cheap enough to eat again. For a dinner out; however, the atmosphere here is little above that of a food court and the food is only a few points above mediocre. 

Worth a look for the price, but go in with low expectations."}
{"text":"I am from Los Angeles and native to Indian/Pakistani cuisine. I had goat Karachi and can definitely say it was one of the most authentic I have ever eaten. Each morsel was cooked just right and I literally cleaned the plate out. Portion size was generous too. Would recommend it highly for authentic food. Ambience is not plush but food taste is great."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, I was hoping for a good meal here, and I feel bad putting them down because they made everything to order, but it was mostly bland, oily, and nothing special."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! They spiced everything perfectly and looooved their garlic naan. The wait staff was fast and friendly and gave us some good menu recommendations. If you want a good place that is not a tourist trap and is off the strip, this is the place to try. The only reason they did not get five stars is because the inital scent was a little unpleasant. It won't stop me from returning, but it does not give a good impression to future customers"}
{"text":"Love it, I come here all the time! Can't go wrong with the chicken Boti and the onion Naan."}
{"text":"Really authentic delicious food. It does take a bit but the food is so worth it. Biryani was great as was the karahi. Could not stop eating!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food is served at this hole-on-the-wall. If you like spicy they'll make it spicy!  My pain-in-the-arse, whiter-than-white friend ordered a dish and when it came she didn't like the look of it. The servers here took it back and made her something custom!  No charge for the returned dish. 

My chicken tikka masala was just right and I love the rice they serve.  The garlic nan is so huge 1 order is good for 2 people. 

Unlimited self-serve chai!!!! Yum. 

Great prices, authentic food, casual place off the strip."}
{"text":"Food tasted ok for my chicken curry minus the hair in it and no toilet paper in bathroom"}
{"text":"Best Halal Pakistani Restaurant in Las Vegas, their prices are very low compare to other Indian/Pakistani Restaurant. Food is always fresh and great tasting."}
{"text":"Great Pakistani food - tasty and cheap. Reminded me of dishes back home.

It is self service though but given the value for money, it is not a bad deal at all!

Very delicious food!"}
{"text":"It isn't Shalimar in Fremont,CA but if your living in Vegas and  need your indo-paki fix it will hit the spot."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place from the first bite of food. I do not eat meat and they have a wide variety of veggie dishes. Everything tasted fresh and amazing!  The naan was soft, warm and freshly made. 
The rice tasted so similar to the Persian rice I am used to so I devoured that LARGE and do I mean LARGE serving they prepare for you. 
Ordering over the phone for pickup is a little difficult because of the language barrier, but it is well worth the food. 
I have never sat down to eat so I do not know about waiter service. The place seemed clean, and they have a tV to watch when you are patiently waiting for your order to be ready!"}
{"text":"One word. REHEATED FOOD. 

Oh thats 2 words."}
{"text":"We were craving for some desi food when Yelp suggested us this place based on our location. We ordered chicken biryani, veg biryani, aloo paratha and mango lassis to go. The biryanis were a disaster. It was basically flavored rice chicken pieces in the chicken one. The aloo parathas were barely edible. The mango lassi felt like it was made out of melted mango flavored popsicles. The only saving grace was the raita but that unfortunately didn't suffice. Avoid if u want good food."}
{"text":"My Mom hated this place... I found it okayish. We gave in to an impulsive biriyani and kebab craving and walked in to this place for lunch one day. The pictures and prices listed all over the restaurant (and I mean it, every window of the restaurant had a poster) were too tempting. 

We were seated as soon as we walked in... it wasn't an issue considering we were the only ones there for lunch. The seating was rather rickety and the decor was hideous. To add to that, the restaurant had an unusual stench. The only positives amongst our first impression of Shalimar was the fact that the restaurant was quite big (space-wise). It made my Mom wonder aloud (to me) all the things she would have done differently if the restaurant was hers. She's quite the marketeer! 

We were brought the menu. The prices on the menu were higher than the ones listed outside, but still fairly reasonable. We were so hungry that nothing could turn us off that day... so we ordered - 1 plate of mutton biriyani (goat meat), and 1 stick of kebab, both to share. 

Then came the paper plates and unclean forks. And we still didn't move in hope that the food would be of redeeming quality. I just called our server and got him to bring us clean forks.

Finally the food. I didn't like the kebabs all that much but I thought the biriyani was delicious. My Mom found it under-prepared. The server explained that they had just made the rice and so, it was still a little watery. I guess I am easy to please when Biriyani comes in to the equation... my mother, on the other hand, was a toughie. She just did NOT like it. 

The owner of the restaurant decided to put his phone call on hold and check up on us. What a nice man, for like 5 minutes of chit-chat... and then he went back to his phone and was on it the whole time we were there. And he was loud, so it didn't contribute well to our dining experience. 

Just as we finished up, food and all... a hobo walked in to harass us for money. In a restaurant! Like, COME ON! Just the kind of closure we needed. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I really love Shalimar's family friendly atmosphere. I can bring my 2 year old and family for a great time here. We share the large food portioned plates, and CHAI TEA is FREE REFILLS...WHOO HOO!!!! The sauces are authentic, and the owners are extremely friendly and hospitable. It's the most authentic in town... I keep coming back, and the food is always amazing!!!! YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"Only 4 stars oz interior is very simple but rest best Pakistani Indian Resturant in Vegas no doubt went their twice in a row highlights lamb biryani, daal tadka, nehari, naan, chicken Karachi, lamb Karachi, aloo Parhta"}
{"text":"We walked in and were seated right away. I wanted to order reshmi kabob but the waiter insisted (very strongly) that we should order the fried fish. So we ordered the fish, chicken karhai, and lamb karhai. My husband, who eats only boneless chicken, ordered the chicken karhai because they didn't have the chicken tikka n masala. The waiter said that the chicken karhai is boneless, so we ordered that instead. The fish was good when the rest of the food arrived, we realized the chicken wasn't boneless. Since no one was around, except a child sitting at the register, we decided to just eat it. A bit later, we asked the waiter/cook fora 4th naan...which never came. So I decided not to eat the rest of my lamb karhai, which had a very stale strong smell. Then we wanted to order the shahi tukrey, which I was very excited about, but they only had kheer. He got us an order of kheer ( with his finger dipping into the plate when he put it on the table). Kheer was good. We go to the register where he asked us what we ordered. We mentioned 3 naans and he said oh you ordered 4 naans but ill charge for only 3. I was so upset by then I didn't even want to argue. If there were other desi halal restaurant open at that hour I would have left. Horrible experience. I understand that this is an inexpensive restaurant but you should get what you order in a clean manner."}
{"text":"Best naan you will ever have. Great food and service ! Even when we were the only customers at 2pm on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"I couldn't tell if it's spices or bathroom smells (or both!), but they could use some better ventilation here. The restaurant is small and unassuming; decor/atmosphere simple and functional.

Had the Chicken Tikka Masala and Goat Karahi, with rice of course. The goat was overly tough by my standards, but the sauce was alright. The spices were clearly visible and had nice chunks of ginger in it. The Chicken Tikka Masala felt fairly standard, with the chicken being on the dry side.

Bottom line: Not the greatest, but works in a jiff if you're super hungry. Oh, if you order water, they'll give you bottled water. Specify if you want (free) iced water."}
{"text":"My dad Amitabh Bachchan requested me to go to this place. Amazing khana. From roti to saalan to biryani, everything reminded me of life back home. I'm Indian but I appreciate good food, and have to agree Pakistan delivers on it's claim of best South Asian food. Good job, but maybe grab some more munday to work with you. It's a bit slow."}
{"text":"Great Food and Good Service. Perhaps the best Pakistani HALAL restaurant in Las Vegas. 

We even got FREE Kheer  :)"}
{"text":"We arrived at the time of closing but they accommodated us, we ordered the food to go. The staff helped us in choosing the order, it was delicious, highly recommended for any body like Indian food.. the food hit the spot...."}
{"text":"Amazing home style food runs by family don't expect so much on service side just go for food 
Nihari daal masala must try this is our 1st choice when we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"I have to update this, as now after being in Vegas for 10 months, this has become a GO-TO place for Indian cravings. We pretty much always get our food to-go, but it's well wrapped and stays hot for the ride home. Delish. I want some now."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on Thursday and went back again for dinner on Friday. It was just that good! 

We had the same order both times: 
Chicken Biryani - Rice and chicken slow cooked with spices and aromatics, done perfectly here with actual pieces of chicken!
Haleem - Beef and lentil stew, again slow cooked served with fried onions and aromatics
Bihari Kabab - seriously spiced and  marinated melt in your mouth beef cooked to perfection

The above plus a can of coke was $21 so super reasonable and we brought biryani and haleem home for lunch the next day. 

The place is not fancy by any means but the owner takes great pride in his establishment. The servers are wearing clean uniforms and the tables are wiped and cleaned promptly. The parking is plenty. Im planning on making some catering orders from this guy so Ill update soon. 

Apparently the fried fish and reshmi kabab are also winners...will try the next time!"}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday at 5PM.  There was no one in the restaurant except the Indian lady behind the register.  She indicated that we should seat our selves and brought over a couple of menu cards.  When she returned we ordered, Lamb Biriyani, Raita, and my husband ordered a tandori chicken and garlic nan.  I ordered Masala Tea and water, he ordered diet coke.  I was served the water and informed that the tea was made but surely I would wait until the end of the meal...if I had known that the meal would not arrive for more than 30 minutes...I might have objected and had my tea.  The place in shabby, uninteresting and inundated with the less than welcoming sound of the appearant arguing in the kitchen.  The lady that had taken the order disappeared for the next hour, and after more than 25 minutes the gentleman who replaced her brought silverware to the table....5 minutes later the food arrived, in 2 stages....I am glad that I stayed as the food was quite good...  After an hour the gentleman removed our plates to package the left overs...appearantly got distracted with an employee who may have been his nephew....10 more minutes past and the lady returned and asked if everything was alright.  I told her we were waiting for the check....later the left overs were brought to the table...The gentleman kept trying to get me to take tea, even though I told him that I didn't want it after such a long wait...the check never appeared, so, my husband went to the check out stand to try to pay the bill.
Bottom line...we will never return...It is such a shame that they can cook so well, but are so inefficient, confused, and lacking in basic business and service skills that it is not worth the going."}
{"text":"If you like Indian / Pakistani food, you need to eat here. They just opened up in January 2010 and are related to the Shalimar's in the SF Bay Area.

The Shalimar's in the Bay Area all have 300+ reviews and are really good.
http://www.yelp.com/biz/shalimar-san-francisco

Chicken Leg / Chicken Breast are great - 5/5 
Kabli Channa ( chickpeas in a curry) are amazing - 5/5
Chicken Kofta ( Chicken Meatballs are really good) - 5/5
It is pretty hard not to go wrong."}
{"text":"Note: this is my cultural cuisine. 

The food here is definitely the best and most authentic Pakistani food in Vegas and infact defiantly one of the best I have had in the US and I have been to all in Socal, DC, northern virginia, Houston etc. 

Now the ambience is bad, it's a run down hole in the wall and can be construed as very depressing. It's irrelevant to me because I'm here for the food. 

So the 5 star rating is for the food. Their chicken tikka is amazing! 

Self serve chai is always a plus!"}
{"text":"They served rotten food to us and when we asked to change the food they started arguing and entire members of this restaurant started using slang words to us. They all are ill mannered. They don't know hospitality. I will not suggest any body to go there"}
{"text":"Hands down, this restaurant brings authentic flavors and serves very delicious food even though the place looks modest. The staff is very courteous, absolutely loved the food."}
{"text":"Not good..was actually excited to eat here but I was very disappointed..i wouldn't give 4 stars to make people come here i would rather give it one star to save people's time and money and also there will be better chances of improvement.."}
{"text":"Food was ok but service was not. Had to wait almost 10 minutes for someone to come take our order, even thou d restaurant was empty, only my family and one other couple in d restaurant. Once food was ordered, it took 30 mins for dinner and no one since came to check on us. They definitely need customer service update."}
{"text":"Great food. Little expensive compare to Washington, DC and only got four star is because I had to-go-order and I order a naan and it wasn't in my bag. :("}
{"text":"Went here to try something new as I usually do. They got my order wrong and I had to wait for them to fix it. The lady was nice. It is a family run business (I'm all for supporting \"The Little Guy\"). They don't speak/understand English clearly. I grabbed a bottled of water to drink out of the cooler as I waited. I would've thought that they would've given it to me for free for their mess up but instead they charged me for it twice & I caught them (It was an honest mistake on their part as 2 people were involved. They refunded me $1 cash out of the drawer). I received 3 dishes (since I kept/paid for the mess up) & garlic naan. Two of the dishes tasted exactly the same (malai kofta & paneer tikka masala). BLAND. Not rich & creamy. All 3 were FILLED with grease. Definitely tastes like Pakistani not Indian. I will not return. :("}
{"text":"There are so many variables at work here. I am not sure if an accurate star rating exists! I have returned on several occasions over the past couple of weeks, and my conclusion is that there are more ways that your experience might go wrong than ways in which it might go right, hence the 3 stars. There are two dishes that I highly recommend: the dal and the mili juli. They are both complex and cheap. However, the other items we have tried have been meh, and the atmosphere is not ideal...and the beverage situation isn't either. Oh, and sometimes the gentleman/owner is great, but at other times he spaces out and messes up your order leaving you waiting for the rice you ordered while he whisks away the naan he mistakenly delivered for your table. Couldn't you just leave the bread?

If you are nearby and craving curry, it is worth a try. We will probably return, but we will stick to the proven dishes and not expect too much in the way of ambiance."}
{"text":"I give this place 3.5 stars. The food was pretty tasty, so it is very difficult for me to take off stars, but  the ambiance and the water issue was large enough for me to take off the stars. Let me explain: Upon entering this establishment at lunch time, there was no one there, except for a middle-aged couple (I guess the owners?) who didn't greeted us haphazardly and had us sit whenever we wanted; The ambiance gets about 1.5 stars at most (and this is due to the nice burgundy table cloths, otherwise there will be no stars). The place looked clean enough, but not appealing. The artwork was of posters in super faded colors, and looked as though it was purchased from Saver's. Did not visit the restrooms, but imagine they were just as boring and unassuming. 

Once we were seated, we were given laminated green menus that looked very cheap and unattractive. Tables are covered in plastic over the tablecloth, which skims the knees and looked a little dirty. Again, very unappealing. There is a cash register on a very medicinal looking counter and a coca-cola cooler next to the check out counter--very unappealing once again.

We were brought Kroger bottled water upon requesting \"water with lemon.\" My friend did say not to expect lemon, but I did expect nice, refreshing water in an average glass with ice, instead I got Kroger bottle water ($1 each). My friend asked: \"Can we please have free water?\" at which point the server/owner brought a pitcher and two styrofoam cups for us. Upon taking a swig of water, I almost threw up. It was THAT bad. The water tasted like it came out of the sink of dirty dish water, literally. I think the previous yelper who commented about Shalimar possibly having plumbing issues was onto something. I called the server/owner over and told him that this water was undrinkable, at which point he exclaimed \"the water is bad here, I told you it's no good here.\" Take it how you may...

I am glad that I waited for the food, although I was very close to walk out judged by this water incident and by the decor. The food was good. My eggplant dish was delicious and so was onion naan. My friends' lamb dish tasted a little reheated, but tender at the same time, she liked it, but I didn't really care too much for it. Lamb is best eaten freshly cooked. The rice had a variety of colors and was a little too oily, also tasted reheated, but not bad. Bottled water was as you would expect  :) .

Service was very good, as expected since we were the only people there. The owners/servers were very friendly and very helpful with my food allergy concerns and ingredient questions. Especially the female owner. The male owner was a little grouchy at times. We continued on being the only people there for the entire visit. The owners did remark that they are very busy at night, which I had a little hard time believing, but good for them. I love mom/pop places having success in their endeavors.

Prices are good here, especially for vegetarian and vegan dishes. I found out that many vegetarian dishes are, in fact, vegan which is rare in Indian cuisine. As the owner explained, they are Pakistani and use much less dairy than the Indian cuisine. Kudos for that.

Bottom Line: I will go to Shalimar again in the future if I'm craving Pakistani food. I will order vegetable dishes and naan only and drink the $1 bottled water. I will stay away from lamb/meat dishes and rice.  I will smile and converse with the owners, but I will not like the decor or the water problems. Too bad I couldn't rate this higher, but this water issue and the decor, plus reheated lamb taste prevented me from doing so."}

Highly recommend all the biryani and chicken tikka"}
{"text":"Best Place, all foods were so tasty. Will go again tomorrow. Try Chicken Biryani if you gone there"}
{"text":"It's a family run business. Food was ok but people were less enthusiastic in serving and making sure guest doesn't require anything else. 

Quite deserted place so not a great indicator that all food would be fresh. 

Go if you don't see any other option."}

I am pleased."}

The food prices are economical.
Food taste was awesome.
Service was quick

Not a great atmoshphere but food was excellent and tht's all wht matters.
