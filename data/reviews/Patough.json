{"text":"We have been a regular customer of this restaurant for while. Since the new manager or new own in fact took over, every time we go there, one disappointment after another one. We have tried to help small businesses in the community as far as the restaurants are concerned. Sometimes I set up parties of at least 20 people for this Patoogh restaurant.
Since he took ever, each time I notice he charges for the food we never ordered first time I thought it was a mistake the it happened the second time and third and fourth time so absolutely it is not a MISTAKE but a NORMAL ROUTIN for this PERSON and it is not acceptable. And I tell to myself every time this is my last time I go there but I still give them chance to grow and improve it.
But last night it was our LAST TIME FOR EVER AND FOR SURE, I will never ever go back there and I like to write down this review about PATOOGH RESTAURANT AND ITS OWNER When I asked for the bill the waiter came back with $77.85 bill for two people and two dinners, no alcohol was ordered for your information.
He charged two times for HALF/HALF and the water we never order a total of $7 extra and he has already charged his %15 of service charges. Having asked the waiter about HALF/HALF said that I order half rice half salad. so HALF SALAD and HALF Rice, now I am losing half of my rice and paying more for it while I could pay for extra salad for the same price and have my full rice.
when I compliant about it he went talk to the owner, his wife came and her mouth stunk as she spoke to my face and she always look like a person that never have showers or comb her hair and said NO YOU MUST PAY THE BILL. I told her I AM NOT PAYING FOR THAT, so her husband rushed to our table and said what is your problem? I explain again then HE SAID NO YOU MUST PAY OR I CALL THE POLICE!!!!!! Then I said sure call the police. You are charging me extra and I am not happy you are charging me extra Then he said, I GET MY MONEY FROM YOU GARBAGE PERSON LIKE YOU. Then walked away come back and SAID ok you pay $70 dollar BUT I DO NOT WANT YOU TO EVER COME HERE AGAIN and I do not want GARBAGE PERSON LIKE YOU TO COME BACK HERE AGAIN HE SAID OVER AND OVER. Then I said no call the PLOLICE.
This is really disappointing, how can THE OWNER OF PATOOGH RESTAURANT talk to HIS customer like that?
Then we waited long enough to see if he calls for police to come, I was really wanted the police there but it did not look like he called so after 15 minutes waiting we stood up to leave then his wife approached us to take the bill and the money.
I had prepared the $70 of cash then I changed it back to $80 cash in my hand holding it. HIS WIFE said THERE IS NO MONEY HERE, I showed her the money in my hand then I said I give it to him. So as we were walking out I throw at him 4 bills of $20s in front his feet on the floor to show him that I have no RESPECT for HIM after being RUDE to us. I do not care about the MONEY but the way he conducts his business, THAT IS PATHETIC. I have heard other bad comments about this restaurant from my friends. If you are planning to go to this place, you deserve better so chose a restaurant that RESPECTS and APPROCIATE you."}
{"text":"Based on the address, I think this place now goes by the name \"Tanoor.\"

A friend saw it profiled on Street Eats so we decided to make the long trek up there and check it out.  We weren't disappointed.  We went in the middle of the week and there weren't too many other patrons there, which was fine with me.  The atmosphere of the place is great.  We weren't quite sure how to order, but the lady who was serving us was very helpful,  if not always entirely comprehensible.  We ended up ordering the Dizi, which is a stew that comes with flat bread and soup.  You crush up the stew yourself, fold some into some flat bread, dip it in the soup and eat.  Yeah, it's a lot of work, but that's half the fun.  And it tasted delicious.

Afterward we smoked a hookah in the front room, which was quite enjoyable, but not something I would make a habit of -- I'd like to keep my remaining alveoli intact.  Nevertheless it was very enjoyable and relaxing.

Overall a very nice experience and highly recommended.  Reasonable price also.  It's just a bit of a jog to get up there."}
{"text":"Another local Persian place that has been passed around a few owners.
The old-style coffeehouse feel of Patogh is somewhat unique, and the extensive menu which includes a large list of specialty appetizers (specially marinated olives, garlic and shallot yogurt), tea, stews and kabobs adds to the appeal.
There is a Hookah corner which is thankfully cut off from the rest of the restaurant (not sure if it is still functional), and most importantly there is usually live Persian music. Some nights are dedicated to covers of Persian pop classics but at least one or two nights a week are dedicated to traditional Persian music. This is a rarity in Persian establishments in North America, and I think the owners deserve some credit for trying to retain a traditional coffeehouse culture that is dying even in Iran."}
