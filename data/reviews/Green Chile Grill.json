{"text":"This is the best food truck in Phoenix, period. Carne Asada nachos and Papa y Asada burrito are DELICIOUS. Whether you like medium heat or hot, the green chile grill has you covered!!"}
{"text":"The asada y papas burrito and chicken nachos are to die for. My husband and i have the green chile grill every time they are on the west side of town. Great service and even better food, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fabulous tacos and sliders. I always get the extra hot and it really is extra. Seek them out when they are near you, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I had become accustomed to often times not having any choices, but as of late, there have been much more options available, so I was glad to see they had a vegetarian option, the vegetarian tostadas...I ordered it, brought it to my desk and started eating.  I was more than disappointed, as there were heaps of refried beans on two small tostada shells, covered with tortilla chips.  There were so many beans on this, that I could taste nothing else, not the cheese sauce, which was covered by beans, not the tostada shell because the amount of beans was ridiculous.  A word of advice, if you have a pot or tray of refried beans just sitting there, eventually they just turn into cement...and nobody wants to eat a brick.  For 8 bucks I expected more."}
{"text":"These guys come to my work for lunch often. This is one of my favorite trucks, definitely top 3. I always get the green Chile burrito. It's a well seasons ground beef burrito with green chili, onion, tomato, and cheese. Their green salsa is awesome so you should also taste that."}
{"text":"One of the BEST food trucks I've had in a very long time!  He came to MASTER Electronics for a lunch stop and there was a line going down the street for his food! Boy was it good!  I got the green chile nachos with steak and chicken put together and it was SO DELICIOUS!   The food portions were very large, the price was good and it was fresh and hot!  I recommend everyone to try their food! They'll be back at MASTER Electronics on May 3rd from 11:00am-1:00pm!"}
{"text":"Got the nachos and they were amazing! Chicken was tender, and cheese had a nice kick.  Yummy"}
{"text":"OMG! So delicious!  3 chicken tacos with chips and tomatillo salsa for $7.  What a deal!  Enjoy - you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"By far the greatest food truck I've ever eaten at. The green chili burger sliders were heaven as well as the papa burrito. I can eat this every single day."}
{"text":"Love these guys! Whenever I see they are on the West side, I try to plan my day to make sure I can get those nachos! Great food, and great people! I've become a regular and by now, they know my order! I love their chicken and steak! Both are great options, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken tacos a few weeks ago at Friday Food Truck night. They were delicious. Plenty spicy for an evening meal. I'll have to try extra spicy sometime if it's lunch. They taste like New Mexico!!"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try them today after seeing them at Food Truck Friday. Was completely disappointed.   The reason they got 2 stars at all was because of the serving size. Other than that, the food was seriously lacking in flavor and Ã¼ber greasy. I ordered a green chile burrito...extra hot. Had I not had to pick huge pieces of chile peel out of the filling, I would have wondered if there was even any in there. There was no real green chile flavor. Heat or no heat, it's the flavor we look for.    The salsa had no flavor and could have used some salt. Just a tad at least!   I was feeling a bit homesick for some NM food, and now...even more so!"}
{"text":"Usually completely torn between the chicken fajita burrito, chicken nachos, asada y papa burrito, and the sliders.. and that's only because I've loved them all too much to try anything else. Not to mention the great chips and salsas. Love the green chili grill!!!"}
{"text":"The name of this truck drew me in.  I LOVE green chile.  The gentleman who took my order was friendly and my order came up quickly.  I ordered the chicken nachos, which are $8.  Upon first sight, I knew I had gotten my money's worth.  The portion was huge!  They give you the option to choose your heat level, and I'm glad I chose medium.  I love spicy food, but not so spicy that it hurts.  Medium was perfect.  You feel the heat, but it doesn't stop you from going back for more.  If your tolerance for spicy food is low, I'd suggest asking for extra sour cream.  In addition to the wonderfully spicy chile, there were big chunks of super tasty chicken, a perfect amount of cheese sauce and a nice dollop of sour cream atop a huge pile of chips.  All wonderful!  Can't wait until they return so I can try the carne asada. :)"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmm Carne Asada Nachos.... days when this food truck is parked by my office are happy days indeed. I don't usually like nachos that use cheese sauce instead of melted cheese but this cheese sauce is amazing, I love it. It is a little bit spicy (or a lot of you order it extra hot) but it's that green Chile flavor that really makes these nachos special. The menu only has chicken nachos on it (which are also great) but ask for carne asada instead. You won't regret it. My friends also love the burritos but honestly I've never tried them because as soon as I tasted these nachos I was hooked."}
{"text":"I had the Fajita Chicken burrito. It was excellent. I ordered the burrito with the medium salsa, next time I will order it with the hot salsa. Can't wait for this food truck to come back to our office park!"}
{"text":"Authentic, high quality Mexican food made with real green chile. The carne asada is smoky with rich, incredible flavor. I recommend the asada y papa burrito, but really anything you order will do you right. Just the chips and green chile salsa are worth tracking down this treasure of a food truck. Only downside is there can be a bit of a wait, but it's worth it. Don't miss this experience of a meal."}
{"text":"In phx for the weekend, and this is a great truck to hit up, huge burritos and street tacos, awesome sliders and beans and chesse burrito is good. Chicken nachos are super filling. A must stop when you in the phx area."}
{"text":"Spectacular food truck. I had the chicken fajita burrito, which, in and of itself was fresh and incredibly delicious. I also asked them to make it \"so spicy that I cry.\" They willingly embraced the challenge, and they definitely succeeded! I'm used to just getting a couple extra dashes of Tabasco when I ask for something to be as spicy as possible, but these guys are the real deal. I sweated and cried and enjoyed every single bite. Also, the two gentleman in the truck were a blast. They were fun, humorous, helpful, and polite and you could tell they enjoy what they do! I recommend this place to everyone, even if you don't like spicy, because the food would have been just as delicious without the added heat."}
{"text":"This truck is the bomb. Got the sliders with 3x hot green chilly and it was HOT. Just what i was searching for.  Loved it. Found them at food truck friday in peoria, can't wait to Try the other items on the menu. .."}
{"text":"Finally tried Green Chile Grill Food Truck while they were outside the AGO (Attorney General's Office) downtown.  Prices were reasonable (compared to other downtown food trucks).  I wanted something tasty that wasn't spicy.  They recommended the Green Chile Burrito WITHOUT the green chiles, which for some of you out there probably think that is the best part!  They threw in some extra cheese for me at no cost!  Burrito was HUGE and very tasty!  Very filling for only $7.00. They came with truck made chips and salsa.  Their truck made chips are da bomb!  Very good, even without salsa!  I was impressed.  I would go there again.   Their Chicken Nachos are Truck made Tortilla Chips drenched in Mom's Chile Con Queso, then topped with Diced Chicken, Pico and finished with Sour Cream.  Lots of men ordered this.  I could see why.  HUGE Styrofoam box FILLED to the brim with all the fixins that was quite heavy.  I may get that next time and possibly split it with someone because it looks quite huge!  (That's what she said.)"}
{"text":"Had green chile grill at an evening stop by the Four Peaks tasting room, totally by accident. This green chile is awesome -- had a steak-green chile burrito that was super spicy but so tasty, and a quesadilla with nicely grilled chunks of chicken breast, cheese, and onions. This stuff is the real deal, Phoenix. I'm from Tucson, and don't throw around mexican food accolades much, so you can trust in this review. Hunt it down and feel the oh so good green chile burn."}
{"text":"Love it!!!! And the xtra hot is absolutely delicious and I want to bathe in the queso so good!!"}
