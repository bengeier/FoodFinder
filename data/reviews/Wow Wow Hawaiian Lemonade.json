{"text":"Not just Wow.  I mean.  Wow Wow.  So delicious.  Hawaiian Mayan was a great choice! Spicy nutmeg yum.   The atmosphere is perfect for families and the food is great! The kids loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is clean, darling, delicious and filled with aloha spirit. I had the avocado toast and lava flow lemonade. Both were outstanding. I can see myself becoming a regular here, especially over the summers when a fresh lemonade really hits the spot."}
{"text":"Delicious drinks and food with super friendly service! So far we've tried the Lava, blackberry lavender, watermelon, and strawberry lemonades, cold brew coffee, micro greens and almond butter toasts and no ka oi bowl. All were super satisfying, fresh and delicious. The kids loved it too!"}
{"text":"The Avocado toast and the Lilikoi are the best! Great customer service and environment!"}
{"text":"Cold Brew Crave Bowl!!!! I'm hooked!!! I love this place!  You can get a delicious healthy & yummy bowl that fills you up for $7-9. Skip your morning latte filled with milk and get to WOW WOW!! Remember the \"Subway guy?\" I think I could be the \"WOW WOW Girl!\" Lol Love the light bright happy place and their wonderful staff!! They are so patient to explain all the great Hawaiian ingredients and guide you thru their extensive menu! I love the Avocado Toasts too!!! $5  Chia Bowls are great! Super creative Overnight Oats that will fill you up all day long for $4-5!!! This is way more than a fancy lemonade place!!! Those are great too but it's just a great quick breakfast/lunch place for a great price! It's my new HAPPY PLACE in all of Scottsdale!! Give it a try! You will get hooked too! ALOHA!"}
{"text":"My husband saw this place on the news and we decided to try it out.  The food was lite but filling and right for a small snack.  I wouldn't consider it dinner type food.   The lemonades we got were delicious and eye pleasing.  I got the reusable cup.   You can sign up for their club and get discounts.   See the pictures of the items we got.  We will come back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Such a cool little place, with great vibes and an awesome menu. I ordered a toast that I wasn't crazy about and they replaced it with a different one for me. So great customer service. The acai bowls are amazing and fresh, not mushy like other ones. The smoothie and lemonade selection is very impressive too. We will Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yay for affordable avocado toast!! Finally i can satisfy my ever persistent avocado toast cravings without breaking the bank.  Wow Wow is everything everyone says it is - unique, yummy and very instagram-able! We tried the chili lime avocado toast, the micro greens avocado toast, and Saturday's overnight oats. So delish! Also had the coconut white tea, which was refreshing and full of coconutty flavor.   The service was a bit slow and scattered but they are fairly new so that's expected. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying more menu items!"}
{"text":"This place will definitely be in rotation as a hot spot for me this summer.  The quality of the ingredients shines through their lemonade. It wasn't too sweet or too sour, just right. There are many options to choose from so there will be something for everyone.  I got the Lilikoi lemonade. It was so refreshing and perfect for a summer day in the Valley.  If you buy one of the mason jars, you get a discount when you use it again for other drinks down the road (and by down the road I mean the next day because this is so good).  The service at the counter was also great! I told the girl it was my first time coming and she thoroughly explained the menu and recommended options to me. She was so nice, sweet, and helpful!"}
{"text":"Love!!!!  Wait can be a little long but everything is worth the wait!  Amazing avocado toast and bowls!"}
{"text":"Sadly We have tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt over 5x and EVERY time the order is wrong. We have severe allergies which we stress to them and EVEN THEN  it is incorrect !You pay over $15 for a bowl and expect all the toppings and add ons to be there and that your allergies won't be ...and it will be the size you payed for . If I pay for a large 4/5 times they give me a small. Then I have to wait another 15 mins for them to remake it..This happens to us when owners make it and the associates. Even BOTH of the owner has messed it up! Maybe they need a new register system or new owners ? We are not alone there is always at least 1 other person asking for their order to be corrected as well...very disappointed.***UPDATE***they replied to this review and STILL have not addressed how EVERY ORDER is incorrect. Instead encouraged to order online ! This is a problem for others Who DO NOT have allergies as well ( just listen in the dining room you'll hear complaints)Do not come here looking for a correct order/size regardless if you have allergies or not.The time waiting for a specialty bowl is not the main concern it is getting things you did not order or having missing items EVERY. SINGLE . TIME !! Rush or NO RUSH it was wrong every time ! They STILL have missed this point in the review . Why should we  order online? The same people who mess up the orders originally will be making it! The solution should be to train your staff correctly ! NOT push your customers to do an online order because you guys can't take one or make one right!! Hopefully they get it together by the time you go and see it yourself."}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is our new favorite! They stay as organic as possible and about 90% of the menu is plant-based. The jar with straw in the photo can be attributed to the owners' commitment to sustainability as they will fill the jar on your next visit with a discount on your favorite drink. No paper needed!   Now for the REALLY good news! This food is insanely delicious! We have really been trying to eat as cleanly as possible and aloha makes it easy!   We ordered the a Small Kine Bowl and Maui Milk & Honey. Both far exceeded expectations and we can't wait to try one of the savory items from the available array of avocado toasts. Yum!"}
{"text":"Such a fun and original place! I got the cayenne pepper lemonade and it was so spicy, I loved it! There were so many food options that we're healthy yet tasty combinations. The avocado toast was great and it came on a thicker bread which was preferred. Fun spot to hang out and enjoy good company. Refills are $1 when you have your signature mason jar that is cute and convenient."}
{"text":"This location is really nice! I got the charcoal lemonade or black lemonade and they did an amazing job on it, although at first the lemonade is a little sour you get used to it and the taste then gets more delicious. Other than that I love the atmosphere I recommend it here."}
{"text":"2nd time here and the wait time sucks if you want something in a hurry. Took FOREVER to get a Pitaya Smoothie on a Saturday afternoon. The couple who ordered after me got BOTH of their drinks BEFORE me, and I'm sure there were others. People who are in a rush, DO NOT GO HERE.  Attn Mgmt: Train staff on how to make a smoothie. And with allll the staff behind the counter, if you see someone who's been standing there for a long time, perhaps maybe someone should ask what was ordered and check or help with the order so a customer isn't frustrated by the wait time. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Yummy Açaí Bowls & Cold Brew! Staff was so friendly. I appreciated the ice cold doggy bowl placed outside for pups! Definitely will come back & recommend to others."}
{"text":"First time here. DA BOMB! I had the Cold Brew Crave açaí bowl and Lava Flow lemonade. Highly recommend both. So good. Love the atmosphere. Will be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Hmm.. I read the reviews and was expecting welcoming, great service from the employees. I walked in and was not greeted or even acknowledged (I was one of the only customers with 5 employees behind the counter just standing there doing nothing). After looking at the menu for several minutes I had a simple question regarding which drinks are most popular and the guy behind the cash register was like \"WHAT!?!\" In an overly loud, disgusted tone. I did not even need to repeat what I said, he then immediately said it just depends on what you like with no further explanation.   I ordered a smoothie. It took awhile for them to make it (about 15 mins) which I had expected because I read other reviews.   The smoothie was good, a better than average smoothie 4/5 stars   Unfortunately, I did not experience any aloha spirit from the employees. I left very disappointed. So subtract 1 star for a total of 3/5.  Will I come back? Possibly to try a frozen lemonade. Just hoping that the overall experience is better next time."}
{"text":"Soooooo goooooood! Seriously the best açaí bowl I've had in Arizona! Stepping inside wow wow is like stepping into Maui. Very fresh and delicious, way better than nekter.... I had the original açaí bowl and the micro greens avocado toast, they were super ono .  Cannot wait to go back and try everything in the menu. Awesome location in Kierland area of north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Had the original acai bowl which was delicious and very filling. I loved the added granola crunch!"}
{"text":"When my husband and I found out there was a WowWowLemonade in Scottsdale, we knew this was going to be our first trip on our road trip! We 3 times on our short trip.   Lemonades we tried and LOVED them all (it's to hard to pic a favorite)   Liliko lemonade (tried it pina colada style and loved it!)   Liliko Strawberry  PLG  Mango Colada   Ginger Pineapple   Lavender Honey Life Lemonade  (Our top favs if we HAD to choose: PLG and finer pineapple (if you like ginger)    Acai bowls : the cold brew bowl and cacao energy) both so good. Do yourself a favor and add the vegan cookie dough to your bowl!)   Toast: micro greens, and cacao butter. We enjoyed both.   So basically everything we had was amazing. What we loved most was meeting the owners and chatting with them! Such sweet people. We already can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Yaaaaaaaas!!! I finally made it in to Wow Wow!!!! You guys, I can't think of a more refreshing treat on a hot summer day than their authentic Hawaiian lemonades, sweetened with organic cane sugar and fruit purees. They're TO DIE FOR! So cold and refreshing. You can pay an extra $5 for a mason jar and I recommend doing it!  When I got to the counter, I asked them what their most popular lemonade flavor is and they told me the Lava Flow. It has piña colada and strawberry purees. Oh so yum! I also tried the blackberry lavender and it was heavenly as well!  If you're in the mood for more than just lemonade, they have a variety of açai bowls and toasts.   If you get your lemonade in a mason jar, it is pricey but worth it on the first visit. My 24 oz lemonade was about $10 and some change. So when I go back, i'll bring my jar in (go green!) for a discount! But if you don't want the jar, I believe the lemonades are around $5 each. I am so bummed that I live far away but i'll 100% be back when running errands on this side of town! Thanks for making all of my lemonade dreams come true, Wow Wow!"}
{"text":"Love this location! I first tried wow wow aloha lemonades in Maui & crave them ever since. I was really excited when I saw this one opening close to my sister. Lilicoi lemonade is my favorite but the newer açai bowls I just tried one here with a custard chia on the bottom is amazing! Definitely trying the green Drink next time. Really clean store. Friendly people. Looking forward to my next visit"}
{"text":"Every time I go out to eat, I order lemonade with my food. However, it never compares to the lemonade here. You might think it's pricey, but you sooo get what you pay for (aka it's absolutely amazing). Pineapple strawberry is my go to, but I plan on trying all the flavors. I'm so glad I found this place, it's my favorite thing in the world. Apparently after waking up from sedation post surgery the other day, I was begging to leave the hospital to come get some of their lemonade. Now that's dedication!!"}
{"text":"Well isn't \"Wow Wow\" an appropriate name for this cute little lemonade (and much more) shop?!   I stopped in one morning during my usual morning workout... of running late to a meeting, but you know, I needed to stop and fuel up before heading there, so the meeting could wait -- this was definitely more important!   I walked in and was greeted by the smiling staff working hard preparing all the fruits and good stuff that would be going into the smoothies/shakes/acai bowls for the day (so you KNOW it's fresh!) I was overwhelmed -- in a good way -- with all the options I could choose from, but I knew I had to choose something, so I went with the Maui Milk & Honey. And wow... so so good!!! And fresh, and nutritious, packing a punch that gave me a jolt of energy.   To be honest, yes, my smoothie was a bit pricey, but it was oh so worth it. It transported me to Hawaii with that first sip... but then I realized I was still in Phoenix, and we have no beach or ocean. Oh well. It's still pretty darn close to being IN Hawaii... until I get there.   Oh, and if you get your drink in the totally adorable reusable glass jars, you get $.50 off your next drink... as long as you remember to bring it with you. Score!"}
{"text":"WOW WOW Lemonade is a hidden gem located in the heart of Scottsdale in the Zipps + Safeway plaza. Not too far from Kierland + The Scottsdale Quarter and all of the shopping!! Hand-crafted lemonades, smoothies, açaí bowls, different types of toast, etc. All local, organic + fresh and originally handcrafted in Hawaii!!! You even have the option to get your lemonades + smoothies in a mason jar!!!   You walk in and you're greeted with a smile + \"ALOHA\"!!! Everything we tried was recommended by the cashier!! The Lilikoi is a basic strawberry lemonade and reminds me of a Arizona sunset with how pretty they make it look!!! The Lava Flow, Watermelon Basil + Mojito Limeade are a couple of other favorites!!! The Cold Brew iced coffee caught my eye and I'm looking forward to trying it during my next visit + try their smoothies!!  Their micro greens toast is their version of a avocado toast with avocado, micro greens, tomatoes + sea salt. It was perfect for brunch!!! We also tried the Pitaya Bowl. They also have Kombucha on tap!!   If you're looking for an Instagram worthy place then you need to check this place out!!! Looking forward to our next visit + getting to experiment more with the menu!"}
{"text":"Love Wow Wow Hawaiian Lemonade - had it for the first time in Maui so had to give it a try when i heard they were coming to Scottsdale.   Shared a strawberry lemonade and haupia açaí bowl with my wife. The lemonade was refreshing especially on a hot desert day and the açaí bowl was delicious (açaí bowl w blue berries, strawberries, granola, and haupia pudding).  I would give the strawberry lemonade and açaí bowl a 5 Star.  My only wish is that the speed of service is a bit quicker. The staff was extremely friendly so no complaints there.   However, it did take us about 20 mins to get our order. There was only 1 family - party of  so a 20 min wait for a lemonade and açaí bowl seems a bit long (especially since there were 4 workers in the store that day).  Overall - wait time aside, I would say extremely friendly staff and delicious drinks. Check out Wow Wow"}
{"text":"I noticed this place while we were driving down Greenway so we stopped on our way back and I am so glad we did. It's a cute little shop in a shopping plaza with a few seats outside and dog friendly.  The place itself is bright and comfortable and the staff is super friendly. We tried the blackberry lavender, tropical, and pineapple ginger lemonades tonight and I can't wait to go back and try more. The flavors are a perfect balance do sweet and tangy and very bright and refreshing. I get the feeling this will be our go to place for a cool treat and the temperatures rise.   We ordered the 24 ounce size which is $5.00 each."}
{"text":"The Da Greens Açaí bowl is AMAZING! What a great experience with friends and family enjoying a tasty bowl and delicious lemonades. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Super busy when we went. Clean and bright inside. They have a lot of different lemonades and limeades there, classic right through to quirky flavours like turmeric ginger, mango pineapple, pina colada etc. Plus a small range of things to eat like oatmeal granola, acai bowls, toast with avocado. Essentially it reminded me of a Hawaiian version of Nekter. Also had live music! A woman in the corner playing the ukelele. There were something like nine girls working behind the counter in a space roughly the size of my master bathroom's shitter.  The place is only new so I could forgive a couple of hiccups: they COMPLETELY forgot my wife's lemonade so I had to duck around the side and remind them, and they called out the name of some dude who I think had gone to the toilet, he didn't come to claim his drink so they just left it on the side of the counter, out of view, for it to get warm - without once calling him again. And there was no compensation or upgrade of the wife's drink to a medium or large for having us wait ten minutes thinking they were out the back slaughtering a turmeric especially for her. What they likely won't be willing to fix is the price. $4 minimum for 16oz, $5 for 24oz and $6 for the larger. It's only lemonade! Should be $1-2 less than that. It's not like lemon trees are rare around these parts. The mix-ins make it even more expensive.  Lots of people are giving it 5/5 stars right now, likely because it's so unique, but realistically AFAIC it merits nothing over a 3 for right now. Refreshing for a hot day, but a rare treat unless and until they reduce their prices. I'd rather drop a buck less and get a solidly tastier beverage from Dutch Bros that does more for me than a pink lemonade, quite frankly, but I think it'll at least be a fun first trip for families and something different to Dutch for right now. In fact I'm hoping it'll pull some of the woollen-beret-wearing hipster teenies away from Dutch so those of us who actually NEED coffee don't need to wait twenty minutes in line there."}
{"text":"Yes! This is a cute and fun place, which works for a quick bite, a long lunch or healthy snack, or for a group of kids! So much to try, this is NOT just lemonade. I'm so happy to have this in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food and the staff was so welcoming! 10/10 would go again. Lemonades were delicious and staff was super helpful in giving recommendations and answering my questions. Love it here!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow...just left this place. I guess if there are other people more preferred, they get served before you.  Pretty obvious we were waiting in line first.  But hey there are other places to go.  Don't go...."}
{"text":"Was expecting employees from Hawaii not a bunch of Americans.  $6 for a medium lemonade that took 30 secs to make.  Felt like a burn.  The lemonade had a lot of ice and I finished it quick.  It tasted ok but I was expecting more."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place! The lemonade was delicious and the mason jars are such a cute idea. I use mine for every day use now.    Can't wait to come back here! Definitely Instagramable, too!"}
{"text":"Acai bowls are great.  I've had the Da Kine and now the Haupia Ono Bowl and I like them both. Both times now Ive gotten the regular size and they are a great size  (bigger than I expected). Customer service has been great as well. I can't say anything needs to change - so 5 stars it is.  The atmosphere is nice and the store is clean and comfortable(makes you feel like Rick Kane in North Shore.. lol)"}
{"text":"This place has extensive menu. They have everything from original lemonade to fruit infused lemonade to acai bowl and toast. Everything is made fresh here. You can always find something here that fits your preference.  The place is clean and bright. The staff is friendly and nice. This is definitely a place to grab a cool drink in a hot day. 4 stars because it is a bit pricey. You are looking at around $5 a drink. I would come back here IF I'm in the area."}
{"text":"the food here is amazing! I would really recommend the cacao energy bowl or the chile lime avocado toast, both are great and refreshing treats! to go along with it the lava flow lemonade is really something (especially when you get it frozen)! the staff here is friendly, making me feel like i'm part of a family, and Im really loving the \"aloha\" spirit that I'm welcomed with each and every time I walk through the door! If you're looking for great food and even better lemonade then this is the perfect spot to hang out. It's a very unique place with something for everyone! love this place and the vibe it gives off. will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I tried the Strawberry mint, mojito limeade & cucumber mint lemonade. Each one is distinct & delicious.   I tried the chili lime avocado toast & it was satisfying!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I get a sparkling guava limeade while my sister gets the liliko lemonade. My other sister loves their piña colada lemonade. I'm looking forward to trying their frozen lemonade when it gets hotter here."}
{"text":"OMG!!! Love this place. It's right next door to my work and I'm obsessed with the avocado toast. The Whole menu is local, organic and fresh. The owners are very friendly, welcoming and on site everyday. It's nice to to see this as most companies just hire employees and managers to run their business and you can never put a face with a name. Come here and support local! Also their acai bowls are amazing!"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding! Your body will thank you!!!   Do not go there if you are in a hurry.  Their amazing treats take time to craft- so be prepared to wait a little bit...."}
{"text":"Have been back several times and always leaving happy trying new items.  Lava Flow & PLG lemonades are simply delish (one of these days I'm grabbing a growler to bring some home for a pool party - these have to make a perfect base for cocktails, right?) and I'm officially addicted to the acai bowls and avocado toast. I've had the regular bowl several times - adding the coconut peanut butter blended into the base as well as without it (both great), as well as the greens bowl which was equally awesome.  The chile lime avocado toast is perfect. I actually crave the bowls and toasts all of the time but no regrets because they're so healthy, I feel like I can indulge guilt free. Final note - the passion/mango black iced tea  (if memory serves me correctly) is spectacular. So refreshing and fruity. You guys are hitting it out of the park - well done!"}
{"text":"Wow.  What a place. Wonderful menu choices. My grandsons love  it and keep wanting to go back. Staff is very friendly, professional and efficient. Great job"}
{"text":"So happy to have finally tried this place. Delicious Açaí bowls! Best in town! The handcrafted lemonade is deliciously refreshing!"}
{"text":"OMG I can't wait to go back!! I had the small kine bowl, the greens toast, and cucumber mint lemonade. Everything was delicious!! Beth and Ryan, so nice to meet you and I'll see you again soon!!!"}
{"text":"I was craving something fresh, healthy, and tasty. Found this through Yelp and let me tell you.....it was incredible. Customer service was too notch, the vibe of the place was super cute and laid back, the flavors of the Huapia acai bowl and the sparkling strawberry lilikoi lemonade were phenomenal. Seriously. Go visit this place! Just wish they opened one by the Cardinals arena!!"}
{"text":"Delicious lemonade, lots of choices. Would like to try one of açaí bowls. Like the mason jars and that if you return you get little discount. (50 cents) off.  Why not 5 stars bc I feel they are a little overpriced.  Go check it out though!"}
{"text":"So far I have tried the Mango Coloada, Pina Coloada, ling Hing mui lemonade, lilikoi strawberry lemonade , PLG lemonade , mango pineapple lemonade and also the pitaya bowl. Overall the drinks and bowl have been fantastic taste wise, also inside the store it's very clean and I love the spam containers for the plants. I also like how the cups are compostable and made from corn. I did have an issue with an order I placed but the manger did a great job acknowledging my issue and did more than enough to compensate. The location is out of the way for me personally but because of the taste and the vibe I don't mind traveling for it !"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite smoothie/breakfast place! I tried their cold brew coffee acai bowl and was so impressed with the freshness of the ingredients used and amazing flavor combos on the menu. When you walk in, you feel like you're transported to a quaint little cafe in Hawaii! I eat a plant based diet and the staff was super friendly and helpful when answering my questions and offered great substitutions which was a huge plus for me. The menu was mostly fresh lemonade and juices, acai bowls, and avocado toasts, all of which looked amazing. I can't wait to go back to try more items on their menu and highly recommend that you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"It's so cool that they opened one of these lemonade stands here in AZ. I go to them when I visit Hawaii. They are aesthetically appealing and taste awesome!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new place due to the fact that you can add cookie dough to your açaí bowl. This was the best açaí bowl I have had yet! The place is absolutely adorable and right next to Kierland. It was a fabulous treat and I look forward to trying everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Found about this place while looking for Mother's Day deals and saw they were giving away a lemonade with purchase. I convinced one of my kids to go with me since the store would be closing soon and I wanted to try out this place especially after reading the Yelp reviews plus I'm a sucker for deals!  With just five minutes until closing time, I ordered and the staff was so nice and friendly.   After getting my order, I can understand why it might be called \"Wow Wow Hawaiian Lemonade\" especially since it was my first time trying an Acai bowl and I picked the haupia bowl. My first Acai bowl and now I'm hooked!  The fruit was really fresh and the frozen Acai base combined with everything else just made it a delicious treat. The portions are so large that I saved half the next day since the rest of my family didn't want to share and it was just as good the next day. I also got the strawberry pineapple lemonade but planning on trying more flavors of both the lemonade and the bowls in the future."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a delicious fresh acai bowl! I was so excited to try this place this weekend. It was not very busy when I went luckily. Got my bowl pretty quick! I love the beachy vibe in there, the decor is really cute. I got da kine bowl, it was $6 but was enough to fill me up so I was happy! I don't remember what was in the smoothie part, but it was delicious and topped with strawberries, blueberries, bananas, and granola. Awesome place, can't wait to go back for lemonade!"}
{"text":"This place is so so amazing! Perfect for those hot summer days!!! So many different options. Can't wait to try more!!!"}
{"text":"OK, I've come here two times in the past week, and I can officially say I'm in love! From the excellent and knowledgeable staff, to the healthy and delicious toasts and acai bowls, this place is a hit! And their namesake lemonade? Amazing! Never have I had such delicious flavors. The watermelon basil is mellow with a strong watermelon flavor and a hint of basil on the end. The blackberry lavender is tart and fruity, with a sweet lavender aftertaste. Plus, try them frozen for extra treat status on a hot day.   Thinking of a smoothie? Try the Aunties Pitaya, with a creamy banana texture and a rockin' purple color.  You can even add a plant based protein scoop; great for after a workout.   For bowls, I highly recommend \"Da Greens\", with the chia seed pudding. Fresh banana, blueberries, and strawberries, honey, and chia seeds top a frozen acai blend, and chia seed pudding base. The toasts are all hot fire, but the avocado toasts are where it's at. Try the chili lime for a kick of spice (you can determine if you want light or heavy on the chili), or the microgreens for a more laid back avo toast. I really want to go back and try the almond butter toast. Yummy yummy!   Besides all that goodness, they also have kombucha on tap in two fruity flavors - pomegranate and pink lady apple. If you want a healthy meal or snack loaded with flavor, this is the place to come!"}
{"text":"LOVED the açaí bowl. The small bowl was plenty big for one person. Loved the atmosphere and how clean it was. The staff was friendly and fabulous. Can't wait to go back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I love this place! Each and every time I walk into here I am always greeted by the kind workers behind the counter with aloha spirit! All the food and drinks are amazing and I love them all! I've never had an issue with my orders or the staff! The cold brew crave is amazing, especially with coconut peanut mixed In or on top. The perfect drink to go along with this is the watermelon basil frozen or on ice (frozen is my favorite)! If your looking for a snack you have to try one of their toasts! My new favorite is the strawberry cacao toast, prior to this favorite was the Chile lime avocado toast, still a top pick! I've come in on late nights minutes before close or during crazy rushes and the staff is still very nice and makes the crazy feel like it's not even there, they genuinely treat you like family which is why this place is my new favorite! Thankful that is my new go to place and can't wait to try more of their foods and drinks!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a refreshing drink with the temperatures climbing this summer!   I was NOT disappointed with their Mango Pineapple lemonade and Haupia Acai Bowl. They have a very extensive menu, so I'm definitely coming back to try out more.   Staff was extremely friendly and helpful throughout my visit.  Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"So happy we found this cute little spot! One thing I really loved right when we walked in is that all of the staff working greeted us welcoming us in and when customers would leave they would all tell them to have a great day. Super friendly staff definitely an A+ for customer service! The lemonade (though a bit pricy) is so tasty and the roasts are super fun and tasty as well! They have a bunch of other options like açaí bowls, overnight oats, cold pressed coffee, smoothies, etc. I tried the Lava Flow lemonade which was so fresh and tropical tasting, but could have been diluted with some water due to how sweet it is. Overall a really great experience will definitely be back to try more menu items soon!"}
{"text":"Best acai bowls in AZ. These are made like the bowls back in HI. They are full of fresh fruit, granola, and of course the acai berries blended to a nice consistency.  I had the Ono haupia bowl, which was also topped with a scoop of haupia. Great job, with a touch of aloha from the staff."}
{"text":"The sunrise smoothie was pretty good and the Coconut peanut butter toast not bad either and it was only $5. I wasn't a fan of the iced press coffee with coconut milk, but I definitely plan to come back and try other items. One thing that I think can be improved on is the service. They are not very friendly or helpful. If you are a new business, you should try engaging with the customer to see if you can help them choose especially since you have an extensive menu. I stood in front of the cashier for many minutes until I ordered something and they just stood there. No expression. No acknowledgment. Nothing."}
{"text":"This was such a lovely place! Great music, friendly staff, not to mention amazing açaí bowls & lemonade!  In addition, to be environmentally friendly,  you can purchase a mason jar for .50 cents off for your next visit.  I would definitely recommend this place :) Can't wait to try their other flavors!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.   Amazing customer service, super friendly, the food and drinks are delicious, clean and cute atmosphere.  I take my kids here all the time, we can't get enough!"}
{"text":"I love the fresh fruits and the different assortment of drinks that they offer. The staff was friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is fun and inviting."}
{"text":"Spent the summer in Maui and found this jewel!! When I got back home I heard they opened one up in Scottsdale and was so overjoyed to be able to feel like I'm back in Maui a bit. Same awesome flavored and environment!  I love all the gear! Today I had the Lilikoi strawberry lemonade and was missing Maui with the first sip! It was delightful and my tastebuds are swimming in the sea of overstimulated salivation. Also got an açaí bowl (sorry, I don't remember the name of it - it's the bottom left on the menu). Same one I would get in Maui also and again, bursting in local fresh flavors!!!!  Now, time to open one in the west valley as I drove over an hour to get here. Until then, I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Loved my ginger pineapple lemonade and the açaí bowl was AH-Mazing!!! I will definitely be coming back again in the near future"}
{"text":"Hunting for a great fun place for açaí bowls, we landed at Wow Wow in N Scottsdale.  We were impressed with their  Hawaiian theme throughout, the drink and bowl menus, knowledgeable staff, seating area, and the açaí bowls we got!  So happy we found this place.  We were also transfixed by the demo video of Hawaii they had on.  We took our açaí bowls to go and continued on our journey.  By the looks of the crowd, Wow Wow has a strong loyal following and their lemonade is a big seller."}
{"text":"Great service! So glad you guys are here in Arizona ! Love me some ling hing mui! My fav! Missing hawaii !!! Will be back again great drinks! Come check them out !!! I always go to the Kirkland wa one in wa as well :)"}
{"text":"We brought our 2 boys (3 & 5) here for a special \"ice cream\" treat. The açaí bowls are delicious, fresh and colorful. (Get the one with the coconut custard on top, omg!)  Our boys loved it and wanted more! We are obsessed with Hawaii and Wow Wow has a great ALOHA vibe! So Mahalo Wow Wow for coming to phx! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Jut checked this place out for the first time & LOVEd it! I'm only sad I'm just now realizing it's there after having been open for 2 months. I had one of the sparkling lemonades which was fantastic! Also split a açaí bowl and 2 of the toasts. Great food with mindfulness about sourcing organic and local. The atmosphere is relaxing, open and clean. The owners are very kind. Overall, great experience and I recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"I've only been there once and got the basic açaí bowl that they offered and it's literally one of the best one's I've ever had. I'm looking forward to going there again soon!"}
{"text":"Wow Wow Lemonade is my new happy place. From the name it's obvious they'll have amazing lemonade, but this Hawaiian chain has more than that to offer. It's a fairly new place by the Safeway on Greenway Rd by Kierland. It's got a cool vibe with a TV showing hi def surfing, etc from Hawaii, but my favorite touch is the cans of Spam used as planters for tiny cactus and succulents. Hawaii meets Arizona!   I had a sparkling mojito limeade that was tart and refreshing. I splurged and bought the mason jar glass too, it's so cute. I'm late to the party on trying acai bowls, so I tried my first one here - so good! I tried the small kine bowl. The frozen acai berries blended with bananas and other good stuff, topped with granola, bananas, blueberries, strawberries and honey. I loved it! Sort of like eating healthy ice cream. They had lots of different varieties too, some with ingredients I'd never heard of, like pitaya, which turned out to be dragon fruit.   Wow Wow also has different kinds of toasts. They order bread from Wildflower and cut it nice and thick, then put on different toppings. I had the avocado toast with crushed red pepper and sea salt. So simple and good.   I loved Wow Wow Lemonade and will definitely be back. The staff was so friendly and helpful too. The downside is that it's a little expensive, but you get what you pay for with great ingredients and delicious, healthy food and drinks."}
{"text":"Rude staff, will not be returning. I bought a water bottle and they asked me to tip so i left a dollar and they scoffed. Then talked about me behind the counter. Very rude staff, drinks are fine but no sugar free option or no sugar option, or if there is the staff refused to help me. I'm just not a fan of bullies. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Love the layout of the store- bright and airy, and everything alluding to carefree and love of nature.  Employees were friendly, especially the young woman who greeted me at the cashier stand.  (Sorry, but I didn't get your name.)  She was very patient with me, answering all of my questions, and even after I spent many minutes studying the menu.  There's only the ONE hanging above her head, and I SO dislike craning my neck to read words above, so I sat down at the community table and bench to study the menu from there. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wow-wow-hawaiian-lemonade-scottsdale?select=fwJO0Zji_nvcw9QoIQml6A  If you've never been, you will be greeted with easily 50+ items to choose from!  I studied the menu online a few weeks ago, when friend Yelp friend Millie posted her review (which then made ROTD soon after!), but I did not make a note of all the allergen-free items I wanted to try.  When I asked for a paper menu that I could read through instead of the posted boards, she apologized that they didn't have any to give out, but that I could check the menus online, which I did, but the website isn't very phone-friendly (at least not to my phone-- it's running very low on battery, since I still have so many photos to upload on Yelp!).  After a few false starts, I placed my order of The Original acai bowl ($8.50) and a 24 oz. Lavender Blackberry lemonade, sub out organic cane sugar for local honey ($5 + $0.50 for local honey).  It takes awhile to prepare these items, so expect this when you are placing your order, or you may place an order to go online.  (Good luck with the slow-loading website!)  This was my first time trying an acai bowl, and I loved it! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wow-wow-hawaiian-lemonade-scottsdale?select=ddOpublJtMhkK4PVdbpfug  I did once buy a few packs of frozen acai to try at home, but they burst and spilled all over the fridge before I had a chance to try them in anything other than on my fingers!  I really enjoyed the frozen base concoction, which included organic acai, bananas, blueberries, and housemade almond milk, but I wasn't prepared for the icy experience!**  The toppings were organic granola (oats, cane sugar, coconut flakes, agave), bananas, blueberries, bee pollen, and local honey (from Crockett Honey!).  I did ask to omit strawberries due to allergy...    The cashier made a mistake preparing my Lavender Blackberry, adding some agave syrup to it by mistake, because \"it looks a lot like honey,\" and she did come out** to ask me if I was OK with agave (\"no allergy to agave syrup?\").  I asked if it would be too much to ask to create another one, and she said she had used the last of the lavender (tea) to make mine...  I try to avoid agave nectar when I can and choose to use cane, Stevia, or raw honey, or none, but I said I'd accept the current one. The drink has a beautiful color to it, but is very sweet, especially since I already started eating the acai bowl. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wow-wow-hawaiian-lemonade-scottsdale?select=wgV3KzoHiaxJagQDP6AuGg  I knew better than to try more than one item, since I knew that the calories (and fiber content) in the bowl would be enough to satiate my nutrition needs.  Hope the lemonade keeps well in the fridge.  It's tasty, but I couldn't detect the lavender nor the berries in it.  Just stirred the drink and took a sip again now, hours later, and all I taste is lemonade, with hard berry-colored shell-like bits floating in the drink (and in my mouth!)  Still very sweet, so I'll try a few sips again tomorrow.    I'm trying one of the Superfood Drinks on my next visit!  My only gripe, after one visit?  The store does not compost its waste.  After noticing how \"green\" everything is indoors, and seeing that the plastic bowl, glass, and spoon were compostable, I had hopes to see a compost bin, much like those at other restaurants that compost their wastes (local Hopdoddy Burger Bistro, anyone?), but I asked and was told no.  Hmm... I wonder how many years will it take before Phoenix valley has trash and recycling bins all over the city like those I'd seen in Seattle on my visit there last year?      **It's very cold inside- even the employees are wearing hoodies- so come prepared with a hoodie/jacket, or choose to go on a sunny day and sit outside.  Don't be shy about asking someone to wipe the tables down.  The employees and possibly an owner (?) I encountered today were all friendly and full of smiles! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wow-wow-hawaiian-lemonade-scottsdale?select=VcYXX_3p7EgIWkTYudOUXA  p.s.  I'd say this would be a great place to go to this spring/summer as temps rise!  Frozen drinks and cold store surroundings to keep everybody cool.  :)"}
{"text":"Order the Haupia acai bowl and add pb (blended). It's amazing!  Super cool staff and store smells so fresh!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to visit this location as I fell in love with Wow Wow when I was visiting Oahu a couple of years ago! This location far exceeded my expectations with their friendly staff, clean and pretty ambiance, and SUPER yummy menu. I love all the way in Gilbert but try to make the trip out as often as I can just for breakfast or lunch at Wow Wow! PLEASE come to Gilbert, it's the perfect spot for another location!"}
{"text":"Wow Wow is right!!! Nothing but a cornucopia of deliciousness! We come here several times a week! You will love it! Aloha!"}
{"text":"We love everything on the menu! Keep going back to try more! It has become a regular family stop! And a great place to meet friends! Everyone is very friendly. Great staff, helpful and make wonderful recommendations! Our kids have made a mess more than once and they have always been more than helpful in cleaning up. We will be back soon. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Very delicious Acai bowls, Kombucha on tap, fresh lemonade made with organic sugar & fresh fruit, Avocado toast, Raw Sprouted Almond milk superfood drinks, fruit smoothies, sparkling drinks!  Clean, great place to hang out indoors & outdoors.   They use ECO friendly containers, (which seem to be all too rare in AZ.)   Friendly staff who usually check to make sure you are happy.  Lots of Vegan & Raw foods.   My favorites from each category: Microgreens Avo Toast, Da Greens Acai Bowl (cuz I love Greens I can't taste! And the chia pudding too!), Lavender Blackberry Lemomade,  Mojito Sparkling limeade, Cacao Lani Raw Drink!  Yum!   So glad to have some fresh healthy options in Scottsdale!  They use lots of local suppliers & also have some rad merch!  Hydroflask, reusable mason jars, tees, hoodies."}
{"text":"I'm currently obsessed with this place! The store is always super clean and their drinks are never super sweet! Their superfood drinks are my go-to. Simple ingredients that taste great and refreshing. The ladies are also all extremely welcoming and friendly. I totally recommend this place on a hot summer day!"}
{"text":"Bow Wow Wow yippie yo yippie yay for Hawaiian Lemonade, acai bowls, and toast! This Dogg friendly spot offers cool and refreshing options for drinks and meals.   The menu is fairly large and has a good variety to choose from. I loved seeing the infusion of Hawaiian flavors on it, such as li hing mui, lilikoi, and haupia. I wanted an acai bowl but I also wanted the lilikoi toast, so I figured I'd try both and take the leftovers home. I went with the cold brew crave bowl since I was intrigued by the idea of combining coffee with acai.  The toast came out and looked amazing. I enjoyed the flavors of the strawberry, macadamia nuts, and lilikoi butter. I would go here for the lilikoi butter alone. The acai bowl was equally as lovely looking, but I'm not quite sure I like the flavor of the cold brew combined with the other fruity flavors. I do appreciate that there's a caffeinated acai bowl option though.  The regular size bowl was almost $10 and the toast was $5. I thought it was a bit pricey, but they do use some high quality ingredients that are difficult to find in Arizona. They also use compostable plates and flatware which I'm sure costs a premium.  If you have an acai bowl, be sure to check your chompers before meeting anyone. My teeth were definitely giving off a Captain Jack Sparrow vibe from all the berry seeds stuck in between my teeth and staining from the dark color of the acai."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have so many different verities of lemonades to choose from. If you're unsure what to get, ask the cashier, they are super helpful and friendly. I enjoyed the recommendation of the lava flow, it was delicious. Don't forget to try the chili lime avocado toast, to die for! I couldn't have asked for better service and environment.   Oh, I almost for got to mention they serve kumbucha on tap!"}
{"text":"I'm very happy to see more and more of our Island based ethnicity flavored drinks and speciality popping up in the continent area!   Not many in the continent know of the varieties of acai bowls and walking in to be greeted with \"ALOHA\" greeting - it's a sign of welcoming and yet, filled with a humility of respect. The word Aloha is usually recognized by its general meaning of love and greeting/farewell.. but, reality \"ALO\" means presence of looking someone in the eye - you are present with the individual and \"HA\" is breath of life!   So for me walking in and being greeted as just that is music to my ears. The welcoming feeling of having our island music playing throughout and seeing their menu filled with our local slang pidgin - just makes me not want to look outside and imagine I'm in North Shore - Haleiwa getting out of the ocean and ready for some refreshing acai bowls and delicious mixture of lemonade. I love the video playing on the big screen and seeing our ocean and salt water, wishing every moment I was home on da beach!   Their acai bowls we enjoyed today was their Da Kine Bowl - acai, banana, strawberry, coconut milk, granola, cacao scoop, coconut shavings, and I had extra raw honey all over and my kane had his Haupia Ono Bowl - Organic Acai, Banana, Organic Strawberry & Blueberry, Coconut Milk, Organic Granola, Banana, Blueberry, Strawberry, Macaroon, Organic Coconut, Local Honey, Haupia Custard  This for us is our kind Hawaiian acai Bowl! Everytime we go back home to visit our ohana these are one of our cravings we miss sooo much having on hand!   To the owners - mahalo Piha in bringing this to Scottsdale, AZ. I cannot wait to advertise your shop to our Hawaiian civic club here in AZ and Support you/wife/ohana in what you are all doing! Please dont change anything - the greetings, music, and your love!   This is a one of a kind place and blessed to have you here! Chhheeehhheeeeee - Living Pono! Meaai   \m/ - ALOHA"}
{"text":"One of the best acai bowl experiences, and in a random part of Scottsdale, of all places! I stopped by while on a business trip because I was craving an acai bowl and had seen so many great reviews of this place. It's definitely super cute inside, but sometimes that makes me wary. Aesthetics /= taste.   I ordered the Greens bowl (no agave on top) and the microgreens toast. The Greens bowl was delicious - really thick, not too sweet (which means they didn't water it down with berries or liquid), and I loved being able to get some greens in without tasting it! What I really loved, though, was the chia seed pudding. Who would have thought chia seed pudding + acai would make a great mix?   I was pretty much full after half a bowl, but then my toast came. Absolutely delicious! Really thick toast with perfectly seasoned smashed avocado on top.   Service was also great. A woman who ordered online came in the store irate about her order being wrong, and not only did the staff handle it professionally, but they gave out the leftover orders to other customers who hadn't ordered acai."}
{"text":"Delicious lemonade. So many random flavors and combinations. I had a watermelon and my daughter had mango pineapple. Love the option of having them in glass jars as well. The place was super clean and festive. Will be going back again for sure."}
{"text":"One of my favs in Phoenix.  So many amazing choices.     From lemonades to morning oats, this place is the right stop!!  Go check it out."}
{"text":"SO fresh and SO yummy! I've had my fair share of açaí bowls and Wow Wow's won me over and beat the rest by far! The menu offers countless drink options from smoothies to lemonades to juices and all looked amazing. There's also multiple açaí bowl options and other small plates available which looked just as good. Employees were very friendly and the aesthetic is perfect for any Instagram or Snapchat moment!"}
{"text":"What a refreshing concept - no pun intended.  Loved the vast menu of freshly prepared lemonades and drinks.  Multigrain toast for snacks as well.  Looking forward to becoming a regular here as I've been here twice in three days and I'm looking forward to trying more items.    The store is so light, green.  I walk in and feel instantly alive, refreshed and happy.   The staff is friendly and polite and make you feel very welcomed.    We tried several drinks - classic lemonade, strawberry pineapple, Lilikoi, long hu mui.  All delicious.  I also got the Strawberry Cacao Butter Coconut toast but we ate that faster than I could snap a pic it was that wonderful.    Can't wait to try more drinks and items - stop by here, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"When we saw they had opened a Wow Wow Lemonade here in Scottsdale we were so excited! We grabbed out glasses that we had gotten in Oahu from the legit store and hauled ass to Scottsdale to get our drink on!  We love this place and can't get enough of the frozen lemonade, also because it reminds us of our Hawai'i getaways. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. It has become our usual stop after we go hiking in the area. There's nothing like enjoying a cool lemonade or frozen lemonade after a long hike. We highly recommend this place! Be sure to grab a souvenir Aloha hydroflask or something along the merchandise wall. We'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"When the temperature is around 90 to 100 degrees on the daily, having a refreshing lemonade is the BEST. I really hope they expand and open up more locations because I am OBSESSED with this place.  I am attempting to try all the lemonade flavors at least once.   Lemonade flavors tried: -Mango Pineapple Lemonade  -Lava Flow -Lilikoi Strawberry  -Watermelon  -PLG (passion, lemon, guava)  -Lavender BlackBerry   So far my favorite ones are - Mango Pineapple, Lavaflow and the Lilikoi Strawbery   I love their mason jars and everyone that works here is SO NICE and wonderful. If you bring your mason jar back, it's 50 cent off!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and completely reminds me of Hawaii, which I miss like crazy! My best friend in Hawaii sent me one of the mason jars, which my cat decided to push off the table and shatter. I was able to pick up a new one, with some delicious lemonade in it! Their açaí bowls and cold brew are delicious, as well. It was a 45 minute drive but I plan to visit at least a couple times a year."}
{"text":"Amazing! Best açaí bowl since 2008 when in Hawaii.  Sweet, fresh, tons of options.  Will return when can"}
{"text":"My review is hit and miss. I first stumbled across this place on yelp and being from Hawaii decided to give it a try. I had never had an Acai bowl and finally gave in and decided that this place would be the first place to try it! I had the Haupia bowl and it was simply the best thing ever. I am a huge fan of Haupia! My only gripe was that it was very pricey. $12? But the amount was very big and could easily feed two people. The ginger lemonade which was okay. TBH, It kind of tasted like plain minute maid lemonade! Except the lemonade are very TART and I am not a fan of tartyness. I like my lemonades sweet. I also came a second time to try another drink. I had asked what was in the guava limeade and the young girl at the register said she didn't know.................   Decor was a 10! Acai bowls was a 10! Lemonade was a miss both times... Staff Knowledge needs improvement Price is too pricey for what it is. for 40 bucks i got two acai bowls and two lemonades."}
{"text":"Great find!!! Everything is fresh, the management is awesome and helpful, the staff is friendly and the menu is huge - something for everyone.  We had the avocado toast, a couple of frozen limeade and a Maui milk and honey power drink. So fresh Ana do delicious.  We will be back to try the bowls next time - they looked enticing."}
{"text":"Followed the hype to check this place out for a quick treat and it didn't disappoint. When you first walk in you immediately notice the ambiance of the place, it's casual, bright, and trendy but not trying too hard. It feels natural. As you approach the counter to order, they have some merch (hydro flasks, hats, shirts) on the right. I just liked the overall vibe of the place.   They have a large selection of lemonades (duh) along with some other beverages (I noticed some iced tea and coffee options) and some light bites to eat. We went with lemonades, so you select your size (small, medium, large) and if you want it in a normal cup or a mason jar (5 dollars on top of your drink price). We got one mason jar and they are pretty cute and come with a lid and straw, so you definitely can reuse. If you bring the jar back you can get 50 cents off your next beverage.   The actual lemonades were really good, a little on the sweet side, but it lemonade. We went with the strawberry pineapple and the lavender blackberry, both which lived up to their names. Since they were so sweet I couldn't finish my small, but it was still so good. Definitely a cool place to grab a refresher and hang out for a bit to escape the heat.   The service was great, the girl taking our order was super nice and walked through the different mason jar colors/sizes you could chose from. Once our drink was ready they brought them out to us. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my second time this week trying this place and it's amazing, I've tried two different açaí bowls were both delicious.  Can't wait to try their lemonade the next time I go."}
{"text":"WOW! This place is the cutest! I love acai, and this is certainly going to be my new go-to spot this Spring. I ordered the pitaya bowl and it was refreshing and filling. Hopefully I'll be back this weekend to try out their iconic lemonade and some avocado toast!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I had a strawberry lemonade and large original bowl.  I could eat this every day.  The bowl was amazing, fresh fruit and great flavors, and high quality ingredients.  The only knock really is the price.  My large lemonade and large original bowl was $24.50.  Granted, my lemonade was in a 32oz mason jar and was outstanding, but still, definitely pricey.  Normally I would drop this to 4 stars just as the cost is high in my opinion.  However, the customer service here is also excellent and they fixed my drink when I reordered it as I am allergic to coconut.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This lemonade is delicious! It tastes homemade. I don't like it sweet, which it usually is too sweet, and they give you a choice of cane sugar, honey, agave, or no sugar. It is so fresh, it has pulp. If you get honey or agave, it is a very healthy option. You can buy the cutest re-usable glass \"Mason\" jar and get a little discount on refills. Not only that, but the employees are very friendly. I always enjoy coming here, and come at least once or twice a week!"}
{"text":"Ok!   Love this place!  What a great concept!  Lemonade on steroids!  Any flavor concoction you can imagine.  All fresh made.  Also I highly recommend the avocado toast.  Fresh mashed avocado on a slice of 9 grain bread with lime juice and pepper flakes sprinkled on top.  Doesn't get any better.  Went ahead and invested in the $5 mason jar which gets you .50 off when you bring it in for lemonade on return visits.  Great for the environment! Way to go Aloha!  MAHALO!"}
{"text":"I came here because i love lemonade.  And this store originated and plucked from Hawaii so that made me even more excited.  Between the hubs and I, we ordered the lava flow, the original lemonade and the mango colada lemonade.  The interior of the store is adorable and the menu is quite expansive with not just lemonades, but smoothies, toast and acai bowls.  As much as I wanted to like it, I don't know what it was, but there was a really odd aftertaste to all 3 of the flavors that we ordered.  I compared it to the smell of oil when you change the oil in your car.  My husband didn't think it had a weird aftertaste at all, but he said he had better lemonade before.  When we came home, I asked my SIL to taste it, and without saying a word, she said it tasted like cleaner solution.  This makes me sad because I want to love this place.  I'm going to try it again another day and see if my taste buds were just off that day."}
{"text":"Nice new shop that opened recently, selling lemonade, smoothies, acai bowls and a few other items. Modern interior beach may be a description, with a large table in the middle and a few tables on each side with a surfboard at the entrance.  Maui Milk and Honey Maca Drinks  Haleakala Smoothie has a peach color where I thought maybe this was the sunrise smoothie, it was good and nice small chips of ice which I enjoyed.  I really want to try the acai bowls  Sunrise Smoothie looks like a strawberry smoothie, but has alot more ingredients than just strawberry.  Will be back to try other items"}
