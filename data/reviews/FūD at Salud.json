{"text":"Waffles, sandwiches, and beer! Who ever thought of that!? Really random, but it works! The interior is more appealing than the exterior. I came in for a light dessert, and what I ordered was perfect. I love how light and fluffy these waffles were. I will have to go back to try the chicken and waffle sandwich."}
{"text":"Place is everything you could ask for from a sandwich shop within a craft beer shop. The food matches the great beer selection and the staff is great to deal with. If you haven't tried The Intimidator yet, you are missing out. So glad that they took this idea and ran with it!"}
{"text":"So good!! I'm so glad we found this hidden gem. The waffle sandwiches are amazing and the staff is super friendly. Great for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night and enjoyed the Chicken and Waffles (love the combination of flavors) and the Nachos (beer cheese and pico both made in-house=yum!) 
Both excellent, fresh ingredients and quick service. Love the overall atmosphere of the shop, lots of fun wall art to look at. Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Nice gem in the heart of NODA! Amazing beer selection. If your an actual beer lover this is a destination with the kind of food you want to go with the beer. An ode to old school charlotte. Good place for get together for friends to try alot of unique beers. Huge wooden table on the side to converse around.
This place will maintain 5 stars ;)... must go if your in noda!"}
{"text":"Had the frank spinatra. Quickly made and one of the best salads I've had. I considered ordering a second on the spot. Nice staff, clean space, good location, and reasonably priced. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I came across this place by recommendation of a friend and I was not disappointed! From the potato salad to waffles to sandwiches, you can't go wrong. The staff are great and the owner Jeff is not only super nice but let me try a few items as a first timer. I had no idea that this little gem in Noda would be a place I would frequent often. For anyone that hasn't tried it, you have to visit and taste the chicken and waffles. If you're a potato salad lover like me, try that as well. I promise I won't steer you wrong!"}
{"text":"They haven't even been open a week yet and I've already come by twice. The chicken and waffle sandwich and the Jabroni sandwich are amazing. I can't wait to try everything else they've come up with."}
{"text":"Wow! Yes! Chicken and Waffles.

A friend told us about this quick stop dive. We went Friday night and there was what we refer to as the NODA crowd hanging out in the beer bar. We stuck out like a sore thumb in our uptown overdressed date night garbs.

But the crowd was very friendly, the staff was fun and chatty, but the chicken and waffles was to die for.

I expected fried chicken, but pleasantly suprise by the chicken salad on a maple syrup infused waffle. Talk about good! A must for first timers. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Second time checking this place out with my lady and after ordering half (not quite but basically!) the menu on each occasion I feel compelled to review. Gonna hit a few highlights from my last visit, listed with my favorites first...

You're Killing Me S'mores - a dessert waffle s'mores style. This was awesome thanks to homemade marshmallows that are toasted to order. Yes, you read that correctly.  Doubt this will be a standard menu item since they are always mixing up the dessert options, but so far they are 2 for 2 in far exceeding expectations on dessert (had panna cotta last time that was just nasty good). 

The Intimidator - this was my repeat from the last visit, but I added avocado because, well, what isn't better with some of the green stuff. Was a great add to this bacon and pimento cheese grilled cheese... I think this will be my go-to. 

The Gobbler - Thanksgiving dinner on a sandwich - for serious. Enjoyed this guy, but it filled my belly after the Intimidator which was a tough act to follow!

Michelle O'Bahn Mi - awesome flavor for this vegetarian take on a Bahn Mi sandwich. I'm a texture guy so would have liked to see some more crunch but this was a solid piece of goodness. 

Beer Cheese Pretzel - Not my favorite pretzel (too dense for me) but you could drink the cheese... which is basically what I did. 

This place is definitely worth checking out. A bonus is the guys running this place are genuinely good people and there is great beer to boot."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place, go now. It's amazing. It appears to be a hole in the wall at the top end of NoDa, but the food is extraordinary. 

The PRETZEL is from Dukes's and pretty good. It's reheated and crisped in the panini press. It will feed more than one person as an appetizer. The accompanying BEER CHEESE DIP is made with Birdsong Jalapeño Pale Ale, which sounds better than it was. Not my favorite item, as the cheese got a little grainy, but overall a solid starter. 

On to the highlights...  I got the INTIMIDATOR, which included pimento cheese, tomato, and house made fake bacon (from tempeh) on sourdough bread. I'm seriously dreaming about this sandwich and how quickly I can make it back for another taste.  This is not a diet item! But the perfectly buttery grilled bread with the sharp pimento and the super tasty fake-bacon was worth every calorie. 

Sister got the REAPER, and all I know is that it's made with super hot pepper Carolina Reaper and that sister said it's the best sandwich she's ever eaten in her life. 

Mom got the PBH, house made chunky peanut butter, bananas, honey and bacon on the amazingly soft but crispy waffles. She also thought it was one of the most interesting and best sandwich combinations she's had. 

We also got to try the waffles with two sauces made in house: a raspberry framboise jam and a CocoLoco Nutella. Both were so good. And the waffles... ! Ugh. I can't describe how much I loved everything about this place. 

Another great point was the ORZO PASTA SALAD SIDE WITH FETA.  You'd think it would be a side. Not much thought put into it. Something to make people feel they got a full meal. But no. This side was very well done. The flavors were so strong and bright and fresh. The feta added a lot. And overall it was worth eating on its own. Which is the first time I've ever thought that about orzo salad. 

Adding to the experience was the very personal service from the guy running the place. He didn't mind our 30 questions about every menu item, but rather seemed to enjoy talking about all the food. He gave great suggestions and even figured out how to make the vegetarians happy. 

Because it's so casual inside, it's also a place I don't mind bringing my 10 month old. She can play and talk without annoying everyone. Solid 5 stars and I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good. 

I split a Chicken and Waffle sandwich. And I loved it. What's not to love about  sammie's on a waffle WITH chicken salad and bacon. Omg. Make sure to dip it in the syrup. Sounds weird...but it's so good. 

Tip! If you've got nut allergies like I do...don't fret they can serve up the chicken salad without them. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Solid food and the beer selection is on point."}
{"text":"Greatest place in Noda if you want to try something new and different. The waffle sandwiches are amazing and creative with fresh ingredients and awesome service. Definitely give this place a try if you are in the area. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Okay, this place would probably be great for brunch but I was a bit unimpressed during my lunch earlier today. There was a lack of seating and what was available was dirty. I told the cashier I wanted something savory so they encouraged me to get the chicken and waffles, which was mediocre. The waffle was amazing but the chicken salad tasted like canned chicken and there was an overwhelming sweetness from candies walnuts. Overall, I would go back to try something else but it better be awesome to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"You HAVE to try the Chicken & waffle... take my word & bless your soul with these unique sandwich. Just do it. Trust me. & purchase an \"Arrogant Bastard Ale\" beer along with it."}
{"text":"We love this place and every time it gets better.  We had Jason as a bartender. ABSOLUTELY A SOLID AWESOME DUDE.  We had new sours beers, he had knowledge about every item, showed us  the bottles for purchase and was just a nice guy. Remember when you received service???? And was treated as a respected customer??? Come see Jason.  So that's the bar side..  NOW FOR THE FOOD!  SPOT ON EVERYTIME!!! I am an obnoxious NYER raised in Manhattan, this is where I eat.  It is fresh, perfectly seasoned, crisp, and simply delicious.  IT REALLY IS. Great combinations and attention to fresh quality ingredients.  I truly am impressed. Try a waffle and chix salad sandwich if you don't like the first bite, call me and I will finish it for you free of charge.  Enjoy people and good F'in job guys you deserve it."}
{"text":"Not sure how I found this place. Just when I thought I had finally bookmarked every restaurant in Charlotte...I haven't!

Some of the photos prompted my visit. Upon my arrival I realized this place is located inside of Salud, which is a brewery? Not sure if that's its official identifcation, but there was beer EVERYWHERE!

Anyway, I walked through to the back to where Fud was located. I ordered the Michelle O'Banh Mi vegan sandwich. I was allowed to sample the smoked tofu before ordering. IT WAS AMAZING! And so was the sandwich once I got it home. The bread was toasted just right, and it was just a great sandwich, you must try it.

I wanted to order one of the sweet waffle options but my son couldn't share it with me because of his tree nut allergy. Apparently they have specials that they run weekly. I wanted to try the cannoli waffle but it wasn't available. I'll be back and I'm hoping they will have a sweet option I can share with someone."}
{"text":"Two words: waffles rancheros.

I stumbled upon this place with 3 friends after skating in a roller derby bout at the Charlotte Roller Girls' nearby warehouse. After grabbing a much needed caffeine fix from nearby Smelly Cat Coffee, we walked over to this place not knowing what to expect. We actually had trouble finding it and walked right past the entrance at first!

I saw waffles rancheros on the specials menu and knew that's what I was going to get. I ordered mine with ground beef, and my veggie friend got hers with tempeh. I sampled both and they were good. The waffles were the perfect texture and right amount of sweetness. And so reasonably priced! What a gem. If I lived in Charlotte I would take all my out-of-town guests here so I could show this place off."}
{"text":"Great vibes, for sure. Went on a Monday night and it wasn't too crowded. Really enjoyed my pretzel and cheese!"}
{"text":"Staff was great, good selection of beer too. I tried their brunch special today and it was great. It was a belgian waffle topped with ground chorizo/beef, scrambled eggs, fresh diced avocado, onions, tomatos, and cilantro, then topped with a spicy aioli. I would def return and try more stuff."}
{"text":"Hipster vibes everywhere and we have hipster food to go with the vibes. Tucked in the back, you can find Fud at Salud. The employees are super friendly and patient with you. 

Alright, here in Charlotte there are a lot of interesting and fun food spots you've got to check out. Fud at Salud is one of them because they have Waffle-Wiches! Who wouldn't love that? The menu for this is limited, but I had to try it out. I got the Jason Gi-Ham-Brie and it would've tasted better without the peach compote. The compote made the ham taste really odd and I did not particularly enjoy the taste. I wish the waffle was crispier because as I ate, it just got soggier. 

The Frambella is good, but the sweetness of the nutella is overpowering. Maybe a little more jam and a little less nutella. The Chicken and Waffle-wich needed a little more salt in the chicken salad. Overall, I just really wished the waffle was crispier because that would definitely make the sandwich a little tastier.  

The concept is spot on, but the food could definitely be better."}
{"text":"Really loved this places food and vibe! I had the maple waffle concoction. It was so savory and sweet and salty and all the yummy things. I ordered pick up and the food was still delicious after the wait. Inside everyone was friendly and it felt like a dive bar but one that you're not scared of and you're not scared to eat the food. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The Chicken and Waffle was delicious along with the potato salad.  I was very impressed and will be back to try more things.

The syrup to put on top of the sandwich is the perfect level of sweetness."}
{"text":"If you are ever at the Dog Bar and feel your stomach growling this is your spot. They have a variety of sandwiches, salads and menu items that make you scratch your head and are yummy.

I would like to come back and try their brunch offerings. Food is ready FAST and you can eat it next door with a beer, in their dining area or as I did..at the Dog Bar."}
{"text":"We love us some Salud!  Both sides!  Obviously being a beer and wine house, their selection of beer and wine for purchase to take home is extensive. Their bar is really quaint and super friendly (they never judge my wife and I for having our baby with us when we stop in for lunch and a few beers) with a rotating variety of IPAs!!! Good food, if you're up for something different, give them a shot for lunch. They always have a great special!  We salute you Salud!  See you soon."}
{"text":"Great food, different options and they have gluten free and vegetarian options as well. Beer shop attached is also pretty cool. Only negative comment is the food can be superrr spicy!"}
{"text":"Excellent place! It is tucked away next to the beer place. There is free public parking in the back of the building. The owner is very nice and the service was prompt."}
{"text":"First time coming here and the reviews didn't steer me wrong. I broke out of the spare t norm of getting the classic chicken and waffles and got something that they have recently added to their menu that the order taker pointed out. (Pico something or other) it was just what I was looking for today. A sandwich that was simple but blew my mind at the same time. The place was completely empty but it feels like it would get pretty busy in the evening (I went around 1). The food was brought to my table in a timely manner and the guy who took my order was nice and helpful. They also had some really good music playing. If I were to take any points off it would be a .25 because the pasta salad wasn't what I was expecting (not the spiral pasta your use to). All in all I will return if I'm by nods looking for some simple delicious lunch (or dinner you never know)"}
{"text":"While the idea is great, the waffles are just average waffles.  We got like 4 or 5 types.  I got the ham and brie, I thought the waffles would have some flavoring in them but alas, just waffle.  I also got the s'more kind, surely the waffle would have Graham cracker crumbled into the batter but...just waffle.
In no hurry to return."}
{"text":"I was never going to jump on the \"stuff on waffles@ bandwagon. I love this cute little hole in the wall store with such great flair and amazing smells, fine! Give me chicken and waffles!!! Oh my goodness!! Firstly it's chicken salad with berries and nuts.. Then on a perfect fluffy waffle, some drizzle of syrup... Oh soooo good!! Our friends had something with bananas and Nutella and were equally impressed. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The Dale Jr. is easily one of the best sandwiches in Charlotte. Homemade vegan pimento cheese and tempeh bacon with tomatoes. So delicious! Come on a Monday and pair it with some $3.50 drafts next door and you'll have discovered a new reason to live.

The Michelle O'bahn mi was delicious as well so probably can't go wrong with any selection.  

Props to them for actually having 2 V is for Vegan sandwiches on the menu. Not to mention you can get vegan waffles. 

I regret not praising them sooner, but I will likely see you there on Mondays for lunch. It's a hip little eatery that you would find in a city like Portland or Austin and is a welcome addition to Charlotte."}
{"text":"So the food here is top notch. I've never experiences such a delicious array of flavors that complimented one another so well. In fact, the food is so good it redeems the lesser aspects about the general atmosphere. This is truly a hole in the wall so I was very overdressed coming from work. Nonetheless, the food is great, the prices are reasonable, and the staff is delightful."}
{"text":"I've eaten pretty much everything on the menu and will continue to do so, as Jeff keeps adding inventive specials by the week with creative twists on ingredient pairings  Get a beer next door and ask what to pair it with; you won't be disappointed. The staff creates a cool environment, too."}
{"text":"I moved in right next door to this establishment so I've had the privilege of coming here many times already.  The Salud bottle shop is connected to Fud at Salud in the back for ease of ordering a sandwich and sitting down next door to eat it while drinking a beer. The ambiance is very NoDa with old movie and sports posters decorating the walls along with beer signs and random stickers. My favorite is the original Point Break poster behind the counter. 

I've tried about three sandwiches and have yet to get a waffle. The kimmy gobbler and Michelle obahnmi are quite good, but my favorite is definitely the Brett. The Brett has pimento cheese, tomato, jalapeño, bacon, and ham on sourdough. The cheesy, meaty, spicy, creamyness is right up my alley. It's grilled and served with pasta salad or potato salad. I usually get the pasta. 

The price is reasonable and the food solid. The beers next door rotate frequently and are usually around $6. The staff are always friendly and fun to chat with. I'll keep coming back and one of these days I'll get a waffle."}
{"text":"Just got done having lunch here and oh my, this is the best lunch I've ever had in my life. My taste buds are still watering from the chicken and waffle sandwich. Seriously the best idea ever!! Well done!"}
{"text":"I hate to start a four star review with the negatives, but FuD is overrated. (Right now, FuD has 5 stars on more than thirty reviews.) Namely, the food that I had wasn't very good. I tried The Dale Jr. and the Michelle O'Banh-Mi. I'm a vegetarian, so I was happy to see those options on the menu, but I didn't think either was good. If I had to pick between the two, I'd go for the MOBM -- it was much more filling and tasted a little better.

The good part about FuD is the beer shop next door (Salud, I think). The beer shop has countless options for craft bottled and canned beer. Also, they have several drafts. After you order your food at FuD, you can get a beer while you wait. The beer shop and FuD are basically the same place, and you can move back and forth between them without going outside. If it weren't for the beer shop, I'd give FuD 3 stars."}
{"text":"Cool little divvy spot with an excellent menu and a great beer selection! The people were great as well. They could use more seating but you can't complain about everything! Definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"Great lunch!! Loved the Michelle oh banh mi!! That sauce was so delicious!!!! Defintely one of a kind spicy mayo type thing but MUCH better. My bd even wanted it on his Jabroni. We also had the cheese and pretzel, huge and hot! I'm not a pretzel person but he loved it. Would love to frequent this wonderful place over and over. Love the Nintendo options. Love The great beer options as well, saw someone walk out with a case of something that said delicious ipa (green&black) & I thought that looks right up my alley & what a great choice. So impressed with their upstairs too, kind girl behind the bar up there told me you're allowed to bring food from downstairs, great plus! Have to go back just to hang out, great kickback but modern and super artsy type place, basically LOVED IT ALL. I remember when behind their building there use to be just gravel instead of a full blown cute apartment building which also said public parking in their deck, but we scored a side road spot. Excited to return to try their chili which sounds amazing & more great sandwiches that are hard to choose from! You have to love the names of the menu items, they are hilarious and genius. So creative, so delicious, thank you for being here!"}
{"text":"The chicken and waffle sandwich is a MUST try!

The waffle is fresh and fluffy. Inside you have what seems like chicken salad and bacon bits mixed with syrup. 

This is not your ordinary chicken and waffle plate. I like the concept of it being a sandwich because you get all the flavors in one bite. 

I will be coming back for more when I am in town!"}
{"text":"Food is really amazing. I had the chicken and waffle my first time. It was so good I decided to order the Hugo as well. But we're very delicious. Very unique menu and neat environment! You can really tell that the owner enjoys what he is creating. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I have never been to Salud before, and I definitely haven't been to Fud at Salud! My fiancé raves about the waffle sandwiches, but I opted for the nachos with a side of potato salad and banana pudding to-go. 
The nachos have beer cheese, pico, and jalapeños on top (and I added sour cream for 50 cents). The beer cheese was good! It was lighter than most other beer cheeses I have tasted. The sour cream was drizzled on (I thought it was just going to be a scoop) so it was a little too much sour cream sometimes. The pico was super fresh, maybe local ingredients. I did not see an option to add a protein, such as chicken - which would have been delicious on top of these nachos! You could add chili though, I just do not eat chili on my nachos. 
The small side of potato salad was eh. It was more mustard based than most (and I do not prefer mustard), and it was thicker than normal. I probably would not order the potato salad again, but our friend ordered the pasta salad and it looked fantastic! I will have to try that next. 
I got the banana pudding to-go, for my fiancé. Once we were home, he cracked it open. It seems like it was whipped! I was light, and delicious! There is banana in it, but not too much, and there was not any sliced inside. It was one of his favorites in Charlotte! 
Overall, the food was better than bar food around NoDa and I will definitely be back soon! 

P.S. I always seem to forget to take pictures of the food... sorry!"}
{"text":"Wow based on all the high reviews I saw, I really thought the waffles would be bangin! But unfortunately the waffles did not live up to their hype. I ordered the dessert waffle with Nutella and jam I forgot what it was called and the Michelle o banh mi. The banh mi was way to overloaded with tofu and chunky carrots, I wasn't a huge fan of the tofu either. The waffle was light and crisp but it was waaaaaay to sweet, I couldn't finish the whole thing. I'm kind of bum because the manager(?) seemed pretty cool and I dig the concept \"waffle wich\" but oh well off day maybe?"}
{"text":"I had the chicken and waffle sandwich which is by all accounts their flagship dish and it was great."}
{"text":"I have only been to Fud once so far and one visit only allows you to review a place so well.  However,  the one time I have been there I was impressed.  Fud is a little unique shop the specializes in sandwiches using fresh made waffles instead of bread, along with an amazing bottled beer selection and a few choice draft choices.  I got a waffle sandwich with Nutella and a strawberry Limbic jelly, and yes it was a good as it sounds.  That was not the kicker though the kicker was the price the sandwich was only $4!!! I also got a interesting beer from Germany named Pink Panzer, that was pretty good as well.  I will repeat again an update to 5 stars if they continue to impress!"}
{"text":"I love the Chili (for carnivores) with Fritos (instead of chips) :) ... my favorite meal during the winter. My favorite sandwich is the Intimidator (RIP Dale). And the pimento cheese is also great and you can buy it by the pound if you want!"}
{"text":"Yum. I tried the Dale Jr. sandwich, a solo waffle, and the beer pretzel.

Sandwich and waffle were both very good. Wasn't crazy about the pretzel -kind of greasy (drenched in butter or oil) and super big (enough for 2 people)."}
{"text":"Meh...
Guy must have had a few too many at Heist or some of the other places in \"North of Davidson\" sic.
I hate to post a bad review, so I won't. 
Please... Füd Düd... get a freaking chicken from any other source but a can.
Go to the Teeter and buy some rotisserie... better yet, cook it on a grill, but the canned chicken is terrible. 
The waffle is great!
But I had to throw the chicken away"}
{"text":"The ONLY reason it's not 5is the seating, not enough or terribly comfortable.  Other than that small insignificant detail, it was terrific ! 
Stopped in for lunch w a friend and his daughter. I got the ham and Brie waffle sandwich, he got turkey w cranberry jelly and stuffing, she got the chicken and waffles. We loved it all. The waffles were delish, paired perfectly with the ham and Brie. The bread was good as was the side of nachos.  We will totally stop back by !! Loved having the brewery attached for a midday ale.  Enjoyed the cider very much as well !! Keep it up see you again soon !"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside of this place scare you away.  It's a bit dingy, slightly sketch-looking and a little uninviting, but please step through the door.  Trust me, it's worth it if you want a good sandwich.

I know what you're thinking.  \"Why would I want to go to a weird place just to get a sandwich?\"  This place doesn't just have sandwiches.  They have AMAZING sandwiches.  First, they have part of their menu with waffle sandwiches.  Yes please!  The chicken and waffles isn't what you think.  It's more of a chicken salad in between two waffles, and it's good.  If you're looking for something with a little kick, everyone I spoke to in the place recommends the Carolina Reaper sandwich.  It's not a waffle, but the flavor is great and has a slight kick to it (not too bad if you don't like spicy).  Even though these two sandwiches were great, my favorite was the turkey with pico and avocado.  It was so warm and the ingredients were incredibly fresh!

While you wait for your food, walk into the beer shop and check out the selection.  This place is also clean and they don't have a \"too cool for school\" attitude.  Love that they have a small bar if you want to have a beer with your food."}
{"text":"This place blew me away. I'm not talking about a breeze, but out of my shoes, against the wall and monkeys flying around the room.

Hole in the wall is a great description for the setup, but take any negative connotations you may associate with the term and throw those out the window. Here are my top 3 reasons I love this place:

1) The food - even if you don't like tofu, try the Michelle O Bahn Mi - an incredible Vietnamese style sandwich featuring beer marinated tofu with perfect texture and mix of flavors. I tried the special, a BBQ, plate. Made onsite and smoked/cooked for 10 hours - served with rough cut stewed collards and black eyed peas (which I swear they put beer and mustard in). The Giant pretzel made with NODA beer was super soft and buttery - served with steaming hot beer cheese.  Dessert was the best - a fresh cooked waffle sandwich with cannoli filling - really nice fresh ricotta and cinnamon taste.

2) The guys who make and serve the food - humble, friendly, love what they do, very talented at making things that taste awesome

3) They share space with Salud Bottle Shop - so you can pair the wicked good food with wicked good beer!!!

This is one of those places you just have to go experience for yourself. It really a high grade product made with high grade ingredients.  I have my next three meals planned there already!!!"}
{"text":"Intimidator was excellent!  The only bad thing about it was it wasn't big enough. Don't worry, I had dessert too - S'mores waffle was amazing! Now I'm stuffed and Uber satisfied! Well done Fud!"}
{"text":"It wasn't what I was expecting walking in , but I was pleasantly surprised. He had the nachos and pretzel and I had a turkey , spinach and pesto wrap. Really,really good ! Probably one of the best sandwiches I've had in Charlotte. Great selection for vegan / vegetarian."}
{"text":"Okay, this is hands-down my new favorite place!!
My husband and I consider ourselves \"foodies\", and we are always on the look-out for great new places.  We decided to come here on a whim one night for a low-key dinner, and were totally blown away.

We ordered 2 Waffle-wiches, 1 sandwich, an app, and the daily dessert special.  

The Jason Gi-ham-Brie was probably my favorite; the waffle (in lieu of bread) was true Belgian style, and a perfect complement to the other ingredients without being too heavy.  The lambic peach chutney, combined with the melted Brie and ham, just the perfect balance of sweet + savory!

We also tried the Chicken & Waffles (kind of a must order for first timers), and the beer cheese and pretzel - both of which were totally solid.  

But ironically, the thing that we ordered as an after-thought (the Intimidator) ended up blowing our minds the most!  Such a simple sandwich: bread, pimento cheese, bacon, tomatoes.... But SO well executed!  The pimento cheese was obviously homemade, and the buttery crunch of that bread after they grilled it had all the flavors melding together in a sinfully awesome way. I'm pretty much salivating just thinking about it!

And not to be forgotten.... The Lemon Raspberry Panna Cotta that was the daily dessert special.  Let me make this easy for you: If they have this as their special for the day, go ahead and order a couple to take home.  You'll thank me later.  Seriously though, I'm Italian, and I've had Panna Cotta all over the world.... But theirs ranked in the top 2 EVER. I'll definitely be back for more!

I love that Fud at Salud sources their breads from local purveyor Duke's, and the ingredients they're using are obviously super fresh and prepared daily on premises.  Not only are they knocking the food out of the park, but the owners are super nice, down-to-earth guys that seem to genuinely love what they do.  Those are the kinds of places that you want to support!

All-in-all, a great place to grab a drink, relax, and have some seriously awesome unpretentious gourmet food!"}
{"text":"We visited Charlotte to check out the food scene since we were bored with our usual Raleigh restaurants (first world problems, I know). We actually didn't have the best luck with food in Charlotte, but FuD REALLY stood out. I loved the location (in the heart of NoDa), the ambience, and the people. On one side they serve funky/casual american food (Waffles, sandwiches, etc) and on the other side they have a little counter and bottle shop. We tried a sour beer which the bartender recommended, and it was AMAZING, refreshing, and just what we needed. I also had the \"Michelle O-banh mi\" and shared a \"Frambella\" waffle-which. Both were delicious--the banh mi was definitely Americanized, but it was one of the better Americanized banh-mis I have had, the avocado on it worked well. It was a little messy to eat, but major props that it was vegetarian! The Frambella was heaven in my mouth. We got it because the description was interesting and unique, and it ended up being light, fluffy, chocolatey, and fruity deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Good food and it was tasty -  HOWEVER: be warned, if your buzzed and hungry...the portions are slight. When they say \"side of\" they mean \"one fork full of\". So all in all, tasty and creative dishes BUT not enough to fill a hungry belly + pricey for the amount served."}
{"text":"Is there anything better in than world than beer and bar food? I think not! And, boy does Fud at Salud deliver on the bar food part. (Lucky for us all, Salud delivers on the beer part.) Their pretzel and beer cheese or any one of their wafflewhiches are always the right decision after a couple beers. My favorite wafflewich is the Hugo -- housemade peanut butter, honey, bananas and bacon between two waffles... Yes, please! Other solid entries include the nachos and banana pudding."}
{"text":"Expected a long line because Guy Fieri had this place on Triple D. But no wait. Had the chicken & waffles, and You're killing me smores. 
Chicken & waffles was very good, but the smores sandwich was great. Surprised how homemade marshmallow makes a big difference. Service was quick & friendly."}
{"text":"Salud Beer Shop has a great selection of beers. Great bottle selection. This place should be busy all the time. I recommend it if you are in the NODA area and looking for a drink."}
{"text":"My husband and I saw F?d at Salud on the Food Network. We tried coming here for the past four months! Finally, we made a trip!!! The perfect fall afternoon on a Sunday! We parked across from Haberdish, then walked about one block (or maybe two). Anyways we couldn't spot the location at first. We stumbled into the Salud Beer Shop, and found F?d in the back. 

We had our hearts set on the Waffle chicken & waffles sandwich, buttttt I hesitated!!! The other sandwiches sounded good too. I choose to stick with the Chicken & Waffles. The order took about 10mins, maybe less, I also had a Lenny Boy Strawberry lemongrass Beer. 

Good but not great: 
This sandwich is good! Crunchy candies walnuts, bacon, and a touch of maple syrup. To be honest I'm disappointed the chicken salad comes from a can...This sandwich would be great, if the chicken salad was freshly made. What do I know...I'm just Shay....I hope F?d will considers making it fresh in the future. Either way I'm glad I tried this, i wouldn't order it again just because of the canned food item. But I will go the other sandwich options."}
{"text":"FuD at Salud is not your ordinary deli at a drinking spot. Their menu consists of unique waffle sandwiches and salads. They have daily specials so check the board for those.

I went with one of the specials which was a \"Beer-rito\".  It had turkey, beer cheese and Fritos among other things. It was amazingly good although a little salty. Probably one of the better burritos I've had.

The staff was friendly and helpful. I need to get back here and try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"F?d at Salud is a great concept. You get to enjoy a great beer and delicious, unique food at the same time. Jeff has done a great job incorporating the massive beer selection from the attached bar, Salud, into his dishes. The pretzel and beer cheese appetizer is one on my favorites. The cheese is made with Birdsongs's jalapeño pale ale and it is nothing short of amazing. The Intimidator's pimento cheese is some of the best I've had, and I'm a huge fan of pimento cheese. The Jason Gi-Ham-Brie was actually the first thing I ordered here when they opened, and I was pleasantly surprised. The peach jelly goes so well with the Brie cheese.... And the delicious waffle that the ham, cheese, and jelly was sandwiched between was so soft... Definitely a must try. Also, I have never liked bananas. Ever. BUT, the banana pudding was all I heard about while eating here, so I decided to try it and I LOVED it. Jeff is a genius and anyone who tries his food is lucky."}
{"text":"Food and beer are two of my favorite things, so when I heard that F?d would be serving food made WITH beer, I knew I had to check it out. Though it's been open less than a week, I've been back multiple times so I can try different things. Everything has been amazing but The Intimidator and The Frambella have stood out as my favorites. Fun place, creative concept and awesome execution!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! This is their last weekend at Salud but I hope they keep a lot of the same menu when they move to their new location! Their waffle sandwiches are amazing. My personal favorite is the Hugo which is a waffle sandwich with banana, peanut butter, bacon, and maple syrup. I also love their nachos and chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"If you love waffles, craft beer, and shuffleboard then this is your place!!!  

There are a large variety of beers on tap and served cold in cans.  Salud also serves wine (upstairs in a new fancy area).  You can order food upstairs or downstairs.   

I have been multiple times and always was blown away by the food, but this past time it was off.  My s'mores waffle would have been sooo much better if it was warm, along with my beer cheese pretzel.  

The concept of their food is so creative and fun.  Next time I will ask for my food heated."}
{"text":"When you just need a really good sandwich in your life, go here. No frills about it. 
I ordered the Brett- which is (delicious) pimento cheese, ham, bacon, tomato and jalapenos all panini pressed. So good I've craved it every day since. 
Boyfriend got the Jabroni- which is their version of an Italian and it was good as well. Not typically a fan of pasta salad-- but their orzo pasta salad with feta is so good. 
Not very impressed with the nachos, I think it was the ballpark style chips. Would not order again. 
It's awesome that you can walk next door and pick out a beer to drink with your sandwich!"}
{"text":"OMG! AWESOME PLACE! GET the deviled eggs! GET the Chicken and Waffles sandwich! GET the Reap What You Sow Salad! Dude... just try EVERYTHING on the menu! A divey spot that packs a HUGE FLAVOR PUNCH! Looks a little sketchy outside but you can't walk away feeling disappointed. If you did, something is wrong with your taste buds!"}
{"text":"While you're hanging out at Salud, the fine folks at Fud are very friendly and happy to help, or  even just stand around patiently while you decide what would help satiate you in your need for something to munch on whilst engaging in the aforementioned hanging next door. What is perhaps better, after you order, you don't even have to stay at Fud - you should probably stay in the vicinity, however. If you should choose to sit back down in Fud, or in Salud, they will happily deliver your choice to you. If you should leave entirely, you may not get anything at all.

But when you do, you'll get something that should fill you up - just keep in mind that it is delivered to the market at hand (in other words, people drinking). It's not really someplace you want to go with the family for a sit down meal with white linens. That's not a bad thing.

They are also a bit limited on what they can produce, not having a full-fledged kitchen. For example, the chicken and waffles are a chicken salad, shaped roughly like a chicken breast, plopped in between a couple of waffles. If you expect a crispy fried chicken breast, you'll be disappointed. If you're open to the flavors, then it's all good. So sit back and enjoy a full belly instead of worrying about it."}
{"text":"Love the Dale Jr.!!!! Just a few blocks from me so I'm pretty sure I'll be a regular now:)"}
{"text":"Fact: waffles make any sandwich better. It's science.

Salud is great beer. F?D is ridiculously delicious food. The two together are an amazing combination. The chicken and waffles waffle-wich is incredible. Chicken salad lovers, this is your new favorite. Christi K and I split the Jason Gi-Ham-Brie (brie, hame, peach compote made with Windy Hill cider) and a Pico Suave (turkey, pico, avocado, muenster, jalapenos, sriracha aioli) our last visit here. Both were just out of this world. I love their orzo pasta salad. They also have vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options. You can even get your waffle-wich made with a vegan waffle. 

This place isn't fancy, but it's a solid deli counter cranking out delicious eats inside a killer bottle shop. They will make their Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives debut in two days. I'm so excited for them, but also slightly upset that one of Charlotte's best hidden gems is about to get blown up by everyone. Oh well, I'll put my selfishness aside and share. Congrats to entire F?D fam!"}
{"text":"Cheap, excellent food and a banging beer selection - what's not to love? While I was not originally blown away just looking at the menu, my veggie wrap with burrata was really fucking good. I also got an excellent recommendation for a saison by the bartender (not usually my style, but this had a fruity rather than herbal finish).

This place was hopping on a Monday night, and for good reason! They had $3.50 craft drafts and really just a cool vibe. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and it is always phenomenal. Just the waffles by themselves are delicious, and they're even better when used in a sandwich. The daily specials never fail to impress, and Jeff is the man. Now go get you a sammich!"}
{"text":"So I pretty much go here for lunch about once a week, since I work down the street. The chicken n waffles basically rocks my world, but everything I have tried has been great. Including their dessert waffles, chili, salads and pretzels. Jeff is pretty much the nicest and coolest dude around any way so I brag about F?d all the time. And it's also pretty nice that you can sneak over some beer from Sal?d too."}
{"text":"I have to update this review because they've literally torn it down to make room for their mediocre Ceveceria upstairs. The food is still great, but at the expense of the atmosphere. What a shame."}
{"text":"I've come here quite a few times for quick vegan takeout and I suppose in all my eating on the go, I never reviewed. Well here we go. 

This place is delicious and one of the first vegan friendly restaurants I patronized in Charlotte courtesy of Yelp -mas always. I can tell you in one word what drew me here...

WAFFLES...

Tangent: I absolutely love waffles. Way more than  pancakes  (sorry pancake lovers). Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, airy, with pockets for the salty butter and sweet maple goodness to frolic in together. And that's just a plain waffle. Don't get me started on pecan waffles  or strawberries and cream waffles and then there's a pecan waffle topped with strawberries and cream?! uh yes please!!! Okay so you get it. I'm obsessed with waffles. 

Anyway, F?d serves their sandwiches on waffles (yes wafflewiches, riches!!!) or you can opt to have them on the side. 

And just for the vegans they have, you guessed it, vegan waffles!!!!!

So that's why I came. After contemplating all day, I decided to get the Dale Earnhardt Jr. on a vegan waffle. 

Confession: I was super nervous because though I am a southerner through and through, I despise pimento cheese. But as a foodie I could not bear to put the other vegan option (The Michelle O-Banh Mi)  on waffles rather than a beautifully crunchy baguette. That just would've been nearly sacrosanct in my book. 

So I go up to the counter at this awesomely hipster, divey spot behind Sal?d beer shop and happily place my order after a long day of fawning and salivating and hear the twelve most heart stopping words ever...\"Let me check to see if there's any vegan waffle batter left.\" As he walked over to the fridge my heart was racing. I said a little prayer , held my breath, crossed my fingers. \"Nope! I'm sorry, we sold out!\"

\"Noooooooooooooo!!!! Whyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!\" I screamed on the inside. \"Okay. Well I'll just have the Dale Earnhardt as is then with vegan pasta salad. Do you know when you'll have more?\" He kindly responded and explained that they have a fresh batch daily but it typically runs out by evening. I was crushed.  

I expected to be totally disappointed by the Dale Earnhardt because there's no way this mere sandwich could compete with a wafflewich and  now I'm stuck with this pimento cheese. But to my surprise, the sandwich was amazing. The texture and smoke of the tempeh bacon was so close it was terrifying and the vegan pimento cheese was perfectly gooey from the sandwich being grilled to perfection. The tomato was a perfect addition. I was surprised indeed and the vegan orzo pasta salad was delicious, I only wished there was a bigger container of that. All in all I was delighted. 

I came over and over in pursuit of the waffles but alas always found them sold out. During that time, I added the delicious Michelle O-Banh Mi to my repertoire. I love this sandwich. I only wish the tofu was served warm like a typical banh mi. I personally am not a huge fan of uncooked tofu but the flavors are still spot on and will assassinate any thoughts you had of going around the corner to Le's and ruining your vegan streak . 

Until one fateful day...after ordering my beloved Dale Earnhardt and paying. I half-heartedly asked, \"Any vegan waffle batter today?\" \"Let me check!...Yep! Want one?\" Shocked, \"Yes please!!!\" I was so stoked. I decided I'd eat my sandwich and pasta salad and eat the waffle for dessert. The waffle did not disappoint. It was shockingly as good as a non vegan waffle. But learn from my mistake: Eat it straightaway rather than trying to be cute because it sweats a bit in the box and loses its crunchiness. 

All is all this is an awesome spot! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came in to have a beer and got really hungry so tried their waffle sandwiches and was in love. Crazy good. The chicken and waffle one is definitely unexpected as it is chicken salad on a waffle... If you want a quick bite in Noda definitely worth checking out this spot. Love the chill vibe and nice employees."}
{"text":"Chicken waffle-wich.....are you kidding me? Why did it take me sooooooo long? I just don't understand.  I took one bite tonight and fell in love.  It has crispy pieces of bacon on it and a maple syrup dipping sauce...whatever you do, you MUST try it...even if you hate chicken.  I'm not huge fan of chicken, but this is to die for. 

I also tried the nachos with beer cheese queso.  I must say, the beer cheese was a little too beer-y for me...for just nachos.  I need something a little more hearty to hold up that robust  flavor, I will try the pretzel next time.  I throughly enjoyed the chips, fresh avocado, and mouth watering pico...(one of the best I've ever had). 

Excellent customer service as always."}
{"text":"I liked it so much. Would definitely go again for a quick bite. Since, I did a take out, will definitely dine-in next time."}
{"text":"The wafflewhich with chicken salad, I know, sounds disgusting. YOU NEED TO TRY IT. It's easily my most favorite thing on the menu. The waffle is crunchy on the outsidr and fluffy on the inside, the chicken salad is creamy and delicious, and the walnuts bring in the best crunch imaginable. 

The staff is always friendly and the bar tenders know what theyre doing. We stayed there once after hours on accident and they didn't rush us to leave. We didnt even know it was after hours for them because they didnt even start cleaning up the front of house yet. I only realized when I checked their hours on my phone myself as I was looking for something else. 

They have a good selection of beers on tap thats constantly rotating. I once made the mistake of ordering a beer I hated but was sure I would like, and the bar tender let me have a different beer without charging me further. GREAT service! Love this place, and I come back often"}
{"text":"Y'all I can't eat another salad in NoDa/PM because of these salads. The Frank Spinatra Salad is SO GOOD (especially when they make the bacon hot)! The chili is also delicious- I get it all the way so it has pimento cheese, Fritos, and sour cream- yum. Also, you can always get a delicious beer from sal?d while you're here so- win-win! Support local- eat at f?d!"}
{"text":"I heard that it was closing, so I wanted to try some waffle wiches before it did. When we got there, they had flyers saying they were moving uptown so I guess they aren't really closing. 

We ordered way too much food, but we did get to try all of the savory waffle wiches. We got the special (pizza with meatballs), the Jason Gi-Ham-Brie, the peanut butter/banana/honey/bacon, and the chicken and waffles. I really liked all of them. I thought the ham and Brie could have used more peaches. The rest of them were really good. The peanut butter banana might have been my favorite, but it's hard to pick one. 

They will bring your food upstairs to Salud Cervicia too! There isn't a ton of seating at Salud, but upstairs is a lot nicer and more spacious. 

The service was good, the food was delicious, and I would definitely come back for their food again!"}
{"text":"Well don't get salad. The dressing was just like straight vinegar and couldn't really be ingested. However one person in our party got the chicken and waffle and that was really good. So get what they are good at and known for. Don't venture!"}
{"text":"Fud at salud appeared in Charlotte magazine and after seeing the wafflewich, I had to try it. I've been twice so far and am up to go again. I love how casual the environment is and it is attached to their beer shop. I'm not a huge fan of beer but there was a wide selection for those who do enjoy it. The first time I got a the chicken and waffles which consisted of chicken salad with bacon on a waffle sandwich. It was pretty good and even though I don't like bacon I still enjoyed it. I thought it was clever of them to do chicken salad rather than fried chicken. The second time I wanted to be a bit healthier so I got the Michelle o-bahnmi. The sandwich came on a sub roll and consisted of tofu, carrots, avocado and a spicy vegan aioli. It was delicious! I also got a ginger berry nonalcoholic beer from redemption works which was yummy for those who don't like beer :)"}
{"text":"Alright, so... I didn't expect to be that impressed by a sandwich shop for dinner last night. But jeez was I wrong. A small, kind of kitschy hole in the wall, FuD at Salud to me was a big culinary surprise. Although my inner fat kid saw all of the waffle-wiches on the menu, I couldn't resist getting the special (because as the guy at the counter said, it probably wouldn't ever be on the menu again): A buffalo chicken wrap with veggies and some creamy cheese.. I wish I had taken a picture of the description, because this doesn't help anybody, nor does it help the business. 
Sorry.... it was delicious though, and I was extremely impressed with the quality of ingredients and blend of textures, temperatures, and flavors that were encompassed.
You order and they'll bring your food to you, and since the space is opened up between Salud beer shop, feel free to wander over, take advantage of Salud's $3.50 draft Monday's (I know this should be a separate review, but it was all part our FuD experience!) and take a seat over there.

Agreeing with Michael, you have to experience this place for yourself. The service, quality of food, and connection with the bottle shop make this an insanely good place to go for...well, any meal, really. Prices are low, quality is high, and experience is noteworthy."}
{"text":"All I can say is...freakin delicious! I'm a big waffle critic and I must say the waffle was great!"}
{"text":"Had the vegan Bahn Mi, it was AWESOME.  There were several menu items I wanted to try.  Nice friendly staff.  CHEAP!  Best $7 sandwich I've had in years!

ABJ"}
{"text":"While trying the newest and freshest beers Charlotte has to offer we all had some sandwiches and waffles to snack on while we were here. My sandwich had turkey,stuffing,cranberry, and great bread it was called the Gobbler or something similar. Usually don't care for stuffing but it was good and it all went together well. Would def come back for something new next visit."}
{"text":"BEST VEGAN WAFFLE EVER!!!
For this factor alone, you should go. 
I got mine with the jelly and subbed a banana for the Nutella (not vegan) and they gladly accommodated.

Service was kind and friendly.
It is worth the stop!"}
{"text":"The only place I've found in NoDa for good food is at FUD. You can't go wrong with any of the waffle sandwiches. Ummm and let's talk about the craft beer."}
{"text":"Such a lovely second time at this place! The chef is such a nice guy, truly willing to customize whatever you would like and friendly and courteous about all questions! The specials are unique and inclusive to all eaters (veggie, vegan, and meat) and I loved everything I've tried! (I've tried the vegan sub special with tempeh meatballs and marinara, as well as the Michelle O Bahn Mi) Only complaint was that I couldn't find the room to try the zucchini bread special that looked amazing! Please don't overlook this gem in Charlotte! You will be treated well and be fed even better! Also follow them on snapchat for special deals and coupons- love this idea and love this place!"}
