{"text":"QUALITY MEXICAN TACOS I live down the street and I don't know how I missed this gem as I'm a regular at Latin world, a similar hole in the wall several doors down. I've only had tacos like this from mom-and-pop Mexican joints in Chicago and LA, so I guess this is much closer and the only place I feel comes close to what tacos are supposed to be, without the annoying Texan additions like sour cream and orange cheese. But I obviously didn't grow up in Mexico, so \"authentic\" isn't really a good measure of my palate. $5 May seem to be a king street price to be paying for tacos but it is worth every dollar, I had 2 tender lengua (oxtongue) tacos and pescado (grilled fish) and all were so satisfying and flavourful--and chock full of meat but not oversalted. ZTeca tastes like brined canned food in comparison. Also--This place doubles the tortilla wraps so the ingredients don't fall out. The homemade salsa (red and green) is full of chili seeds by the way. Ugh it was just so amazing in the greasiest way. Fine diners move along: It does not look like the cleanest place, and the cooks are definitely going to take a while making your order on the spot. Also, English isn't their first language. So be nice and wait for it."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. Even more amazing quesadilla. I am so happy this place is in walking distance from my house.  My personal opinion - did not really like the breaded chicken breast taco but the quesadilla with pork was absolutely delicious, I do suggest giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Old owners of Tenoch! Great tacos but don't expect to sit down! They aren't cheap either, but they are authentic and great people."}
{"text":"Itacate is a small family run taqueria located in the west end of Toronto. It's situated inside a butcher shop on the Northwest corner of St.Clair Ave West and Oakwood Ave right across Oakwood Collegiate Institute. It's a place I have been meaning to try since it's usually on the list of hidden gem hotspots in Toronto and has gotten rave reviews for serving authentic Mexican tacos.  I ordered two tacos ($5 each tax included), a steak, cheese and onion taco and something adventurous which was a cow tongue taco. Both tacos came on a double layered soft tortilla. The tacos don't come with any dressing and you have the option of dressing the tacos with chopped onions, cilantro, hot sauce, guac and lime for drizzling.  The tacos were authentic and delicious, brought back memories of getting tacos from food stalls when I visited Mexico. Nice fresh soft tortillas, the steak, cheese and onion taco was delicious. I had never tried cow tongue before so i was expecting something chewy, the cow tongue was really soft and tender surprisingly, but could have used a little bit more seasoning.  Overall, if you are looking for a simple no frills place to have good authentic tacos, you should definitely check out Itacate. The tacos aren't cheap at $5 each tax included but the prices aren't crazy either, let's be honest, eating out in Toronto isn't cheap anymore. It's definitely a hole in the wall gem for authentic Mexican tacos."}
{"text":"THE BEST YET!!!!  I live close and try to eat here as Often as I can. The pork , sausage and steak are amazing. Some of the best in the gta and I try a lot of tacos.    The best for me in ranking in the pulled pork Taco with their green hot sauce (more Mild) ***** IT IS SOOOO GOOD , and the beef , the sausage and cheese...only because sausage is never my fav  The taco shells are fresh and made from scratch and the pork is slow roasted and tender. It is absolutely amazing.   Portion size is like your hand spread out and tall. Bigger than most for $5 a taco. Worth it 100%.   I need to try more there!!!!"}
{"text":"Great tacos. Some of the best I've ever had. The service is a little wonky but the tacos are amazing.  have I mentioned the tacos aee amazing? Also the tamales. Amazing."}
{"text":"Best authentic Tacos EVER!!!! They are even better than tacos we had in Mexico. If haven't eaten here, you are missing out!! They make everything fresh!! You wait a bit for them but its worth it because fresh tacos taste different. The Carnitas, beef and chorizo and potatoes are my absolute favourites. My boyfriend's favourite is the fish. The flavour is ridiculously amazing and they give you a generous side of green and red hot sauce, chopped onions and lime and cilantro. Plus they open till 10 most nights: One of the only late night places on St Clair west."}
{"text":"Oh man. This is real deal Mexican for affordable prices. So good.   We ordered the steak, onion and cheese taco, carnitas, pork and chicken. They were all completely heaped with piles of meat. The cheese was generous, the pork taco seasoning was so savoury and paired really well with the pineapple on top, and the carnita and chicken were both tasty. Drinks were standard Mexican pops, which I love-Jarritos, Squirt, Cidral.   Service was friendly and prompt, but the tacos are made to order so we waited around 15 minutes. The location is small and has a little butcher case at the back. There's a bit of seating, but I wouldn't count on being able to sit down.   We ordered ours to go and were provided with salsa verde, a spicier red salsa, a whole lime, and lots of cilantro and onion. Really generous portions of each!   This location is cash only and doesn't have an ATM, so come prepared."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. Totally authentic. The menu is in Spanish but the staff speak English. Watch for the salsas - they are hot!  Another tip: if you want tacos, you need to be there during the first shift (before 9pm, I believe). Otherwise, they only make tortas. They're okay, but not as good as the tacos. The butcher shop part of the store in the back seems a bit odd -- hardly any stuff in the refrigerator -- but adds to the unique ambience of the place."}
{"text":"Probably the best tacos in Toronto.  Each tacos come with a generous serving of meat.  I ordered Pastor, Pulled Pork, Cow tongue and Sausage and Potatoes and I was stuffed.  Definitely coming back again to try to rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Wonderful food that is authentically Mexican. The tacos are loaded with meat and trimmings. At $5 each, a real bargain. My granddaughter loved her quesadilla, and the sandwich, the pombazo, was loaded with meat, cheese and other goodies, and was HUGE."}
{"text":"Most legit meat tacos in this city. Reminds me of the trucks in Mexico City. Worth going out of your way for, though keep in mind if you're a fancy person, this place isn't for you. Great tacos for a quick lunch/dinner. Al Pastor is actually on a spit with pineapple. Need I say more?"}
