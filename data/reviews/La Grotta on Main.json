{"text":"In total, i've been here 3 times..not including take out once.

I've got to say...every time I go here, the food goes downhill. 
I was completely in love with this restaurant when i was first brought here. 
The deco was nice, music was beautiful, the food was EXCELLENT (I ordered the seafood pasta and the creme brule) , however...the service..OMG! It's always the same guy serving us. 
He was very polite to my company, since my company knows him, but he COMPLETELY IGNORED ME ALL THOSE TIMES, not ever looking in my direction AT ALL , other then taking my order and when he was taking my order, he was RUDE. I wanted to slap him!

As I was saying...our experience after that was horrid. The same usual crappy rude service.
Actually, the last time I went there, I got sick. The seafood pasta tasted very off and my creme brule....was COLD. The bottom was FROZEN actually. As soon as we left the restaurant, I had to run out to puke. 

I was disgusted...vowing to never go there again."}
{"text":"Ate there last summer.  What a huge disappointment.  The place is dusty and very dated.  The waitress screwed up our order, I ordered veal and received chicken.  For the price of the food, I swear it tasted like a michelina frozen entree.  Really for over $22.00, I should be getting fresh homemade pasta, not the crap I was served, it barely filled a soup cup.  Really bad place to eat.  Never been back, and never going back. Stay away.  By the way, comping a free pour drink doesn't impress when your food is crap."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night and it was recommended by my cousin. The restaurant decor is nice and there is a lot of patio space. However, for a Sunday night, they were really quiet. The whole time we were there, there were only 4 other tables. One of which left after being seating for 10 minutes. It was a family of 5 and I imagine it was because the menu was suited for their children.

The menu is quite pricey, in an around $22-30 for a main. My friend and I decided to do the price fix menu based on this. For $30 or $40, you can get an appetizer, entree and dessert. 

We both had the soup of the day which was asparagus cream soup which was delicious! I've never heard of it or had it, and it was really delicious. We then shared the beef tenderloin spaghetti and chicken cutlet with a side of veggies. The entree was alright, and we only had 2 selections for dessert. Tiramisu or sorbet. We tried both and they were alright. The tiramisu I found a little too sweet.

The waitress was lovely and I imagine they are busier in the summer time."}
{"text":"The OWNER was so rude to is and our kids. We had made reservation on a Saturday night and the owner greeted us at the door. When we called to make this reservation, we requested to be seated on the patio, but it was busy and we understood that it may not happen. Once we were greeted by a less than inviting gentleman at the door, we saw that our table was set and ready inside. We mentioned that we had requested to be seated on the patio and the OWNER said to us \"No you didn't\". We then asked how long it would be to wait for a patio table? He said that there was not one available and just got even more flustered. We were ready to accept the table inside and just sit down for a lovely dinner when he started getting even more rude to us. I said to him that none of us were trying to give him a hard time and that's when he snapped. He said to us that we were just pushing him to give us a table outside and he was quite visibly without patience of any kind, not that we were after anything other than a nice meal from his restaurant. I said to my wife, \"Okay that's it, let's go\". At which point he turned around and walked away and apparently didn't care that we were not enjoying this experience. On our way out, I stopped and asked the barkeep if that was the OWNER, just in case it was a stressed employee that the OWNER should know about. I was reluctantly informed that it was I fact the OWNER that had treated us so rudely. It must be nice to have so much business that you can irritate paying customers to the point of leaving. We then went down the road to the Blacksmith and had a wonderful last minute dinner. We spent $300 there that night and will be back to the Blacksmith again. Needless to say, we will never be back to La Grotta again!!"}
{"text":"The place was empty except for our party of 12, but it was Super Bowl Sunday so I'll assume most restaurants are fairly empty on this day. I wouldn't be surprised if it was this empty all the time though, because this is essentially an overpriced tourist trap with crappy food. I guess its to be expected that the restaurants in Unionville are tourist traps, as Main St is a mini Niagara on the Lake wannabe. 

I ordered the $30 prix fixe course, with roasted portobello, chicken valdostana and tiramisu. 

First, the bread. The bread came out cold and tasted like a cheap baguette from No Frills. The garlic butter that it came with was nothing to write home about. I've had much yummier warm bread with delicious spreads from many Italian places, so this was a big disappointment.

The portobello was a meh...a little bit dry, OK flavour, vegetables on the side  a bit overcooked. I've made much better portobello myself.

The chicken was just nasty and unappetizing with some overly salty \"wine sauce\" that tasted like soya sauce and made the dish difficult to consume. The chicken valdostana is essentially a piece of chicken with a ham on top coated with cheese, so you can imagine the saltiness of ham + soya \"wine\" sauce = really salty. The dish was served with the same wilted overcooked veggies and a couple of tasteless crumbling slices of potatoes.

The tiramisu was the worst part of the meal, as it tasted like some stale dessert I would find at a cheap Chinese buffet rather than an \"upscale\" restaurant. I love tiramisu, and usually eat everything, but I could just not bring myself to finish dessert.

The overall mood after consumption from the rest of my party was \"unimpressed\", so it probably wasn't just me.

Like a previous reviewer stated, I really felt like this was next on the list for Kitchen Nightmares. The owner tries hard to entertain and was very hospitable, but the food is simply horrible and there are much better options for the prices they demand."}
{"text":"I had dinner with my son, without hesitation come across this place , we were serve bread which is very dry and cold. We got the fixed meal of 29.99. The worst meal we ever had and overprice. I will never come back to this place again"}
{"text":"ugh. Terrible. Worst restaurant in Markham and that's saying something. We  ate here FOUR times / gave them FOUR chances / and it got worse each time. Terrible food, terribly high prices, terrible asshole staff and owners. Avoid at all costs. How do I give zero stars - is that possible ?????"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Friday night couple weeks ago and it was empty there was only 3 tables there before us and they were all out on the patio so we decided to join them as we don't want to be the only ones indoors.  I found it odd when we were getting seated he asked us if we had any coupons and pulled out some menu from the back when we said no.  I noticed everyone that came after us had a different menu than what we got; apparently they had some sort of coupon from like groupon.  The menu they got had limited choices.  That didn't sound honest as they can only order for a fix menu and the portions apparently smaller which I couldn't confirm directly.  I spoke to the couple beside us and they told us that the coupon never said they had to order from a special menu so they weren't pleased as well.  The regular portion is already quite small and I can't imagine it being any smaller.  The decor at La Grotta is nice and would attract the tourist here.  The food is on the pricey side as well.  The food quality is not that good as the veal I got wasn't even hot and quite dry.  It just looks like the heated up the pasta sauce and pour it on top of the veal to heat it up and added some cheese.  I do not think I would return here as there are better options on Main.

{"text":"We went here on Mother's Day this year. Granted Mother's Day is insane no matter where you go, this restaurant was not a good experience in any way. We made reservations beforehand (because you needed to) and yet when we arrived no one talked to us and just kept running past us. 
When we finally stopped someone and said we had reservations he looked down at the table seating and pointed with his head where our table was. We weren't entirely sure and one of the other wait staff (a young girl) doubled checked to make sure. She apologized and was probably the only person who knew proper restaurant service and knew how to run the place. 
We were placed right in front of the patio door and squished between two other large groups.... Sorry but if we made reservations and so did the other people you should make sure you have enough floor space to seat all of these people. 2 people from my party of 5 had to stand up at least 8 times during our meal to let people pass because there was not enough room.
The food was just MEH.... NOT worth the price. We joked that their 'soup of the day' tasted like Campbell's canned tomato soup. 
Aside from their tiramisu tasting good everything else was not that good.

Lastly, we were surprised to see the price was NOT the same for their price fixed menu from their website. It was more expensive when we arrived and sat down.

I would never go back and will definitely not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst meal I've ever had in my entire life. I actually ate here a month ago, but I still get so upset thinking about it so I had to come on here to tell everyone to STAY AWAY. Stay far far away. 

First of all, we were seated at a table with dirt on the tablecloth, dust in one of the wine glasses, and a nice layer of grime covering the other. This was the first red flag. 

For appetizers, we ordered the calamari which was cold and bland. They tasted worse than the frozen kind you buy at the grocery store. Mind you, this took ages to come out. The restaurant was not busy so they truly have no excuse to bring out cold bland food and call it a day, especially at this price point. Unfortunately, this wasn't even the worst part. 

We waited over an HOUR for our main courses to come out. Now, if this was the best meal I've ever had in my life I wouldn't mind. In fact, I wouldn't even mind if it was the most mediocre meal I've ever had because I was grumpy, starving, and could not wait to eat and get my butt home. We honestly should've just left at this point but we were in too deep.

Our pastas finally arrive! Hooray! God is good! 

After that lacklustre excuse for calamari, I should've known better.

IT'S COLD! THEY SERVED ME COLD PASTA AND POURED ROOM TEMPERATURE CANNED PASTA SAUCE ON TOP! THE AUDACITY. AFTER A FULL HOUR+ LONG WAIT. 

The sauce had that distinct overtly sweet flavour you get from a can. The pasta was cold and tasted stale. I know for a fact they did not make this bad boy from scratch. And if they did, and they truly took over an hour to get this plate from the kitchen to me then wow. Really. Just wow. 

If you want a more authentic Italian experience go to East Side Mario's or buy a can of Chef Boyardee.

But really though, save your money and take it elsewhere for a nice night out, whether it's with your S/O, your family, your friends, or your side chick. Yes, this restaurant is not even side chick worthy. 

There are lots of other places to eat at in this neighbourhood. 

0/5"}
{"text":"I would have given it a half star if such an option exists. Slow service, bad hygiene, crappy food, all the bad things you can think of. Stay away from this place when you are in unionville village."}
{"text":"I came here for my cousins bridal shower on Sunday afternoon. This restaurant is located in a nice area and has a great ambience. The back patio was beautiful to take pictures in. That being said, I give this place three stars because even though it had a nice atmosphere and friendly staff, for an Italian restaurant I expected the food to be a lot better. I am not too upset considering I didn't come here for dinner and was not paying for a meal. Overall it was a nice experience but I don't know if id eat here if I hadn't been invited."}
{"text":"Not worth the money for this poor example of \"Italian food\". 
Orders came out wrong, cold and straight out of a can.
Usually dessert is an easy part of the experience to get right...but of course not here.  Crème brûlée was absolutely a joke because it had the texture of ricotta.
I can't recommend this place to anyone but I hope La Grotta can really improve because it's a nice location."}
{"text":"Never coming back here again!

This place is atrocious, I would not recommend anyone dining here. 

First off, the place wasn't that busy but I still had to wait to be seated, secondly, the level of hygiene in this place was disgusting. The glass of water I was served had green particles of something floating in it, yuck! So I wasn't drinking out of that glass. My utensils the spoon had leftover particles on it as well so I wasn't using that.

I ordered the gnocchi, you get a small portion and it's over-priced.

The place is so dark inside too, bad lighting. Service was slow, they took so long to get my food to me that the waiter even came up to me and said \"Don't worry we haven't forgotten about you sir!\".

I'm done!"}
{"text":"I wish I can give 0 stars. Super slow service! Mussels are not fresh! Can't think of one thing that is gd abt this place! Do not come!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with 6 girls out on a whim. Food was good, service as excellent. Gluten free pasta was amazing and their pizza was tasty. The staff were very Funny,friendly and sweet. Found it a little odd that there were only 3 other occupied tables on a Saturday night but apparently their busy in the summer with the patio. All of us decided we would go back :)"}
{"text":"We started with the bruschetta with feta. It was an average size portion and was very tasty. I ordered the chicken parm with extra spice and it was excellent. The server even brought a dish of oil peppers and spices to the table so I could add more if wanted. My date had the linguini and meatballs. She said it was well done and tasted good. The restaurant was very empty for a Friday night at 630 as we were the only ones there. The server was very good and very polite. I would recommend checking this place out on Main Street Unionville. There is free parking behind the restaurant and easy access to the door and patio at the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner last night and we had a very enjoyable evening.  Although the decor was dated, the service was excellent.   We used the entertainment book electronic coupon which looked like the code would expire before we paid our bill but the server told us not to worry about it and without any reminder, he reduced the bill.  That is real good service!  I had the Prix Fixe $29.95 menu choosing the veal pizzaiola as the main and it was delicious but the portion was a bit small.  My husband and daughter ordered the veal parmigiana and seafood pasta and they really enjoyed it.  Overall we had a great time and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Overall 1.5/5. 

The table we were seated at was visibly dusty/dirty along with the inside of our water glasses which was sticky.

For our appetizers, we ordered fried calamari which was disappointingly store-bought and bruschetta which was okay as far as bread and diced tomatoes go.

For our entrées, we ordered a Pasta Pescatore (seafood pasta) and Agnolotti Della Grotta (three-cheese ravioli). The pasta was below average overall - I wish the shrimp had been de-shelled. The mussels were cooked correctly.

However, the ravioli arrived stone cold and had to be reheated as per our request. Flavour-wise it was bland and rather disappointing. It was essentially eating cold pasta in a warm \"vodka rosé\" sauce. 

In terms of service, the staff were friendly but our entrées took about 40 minutes to arrive on a not-so-busy evening. 

Overall the experience was subpar for an \"Italian\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. By far the WORST meal I have ever eaten. Service was slow. All the tables were dirty on the patio and hygiene was lacking. Had to ask repeatedly for water, bread basket, etc. Waiter didn't know the meal and seemed confused when asked about what pizza toppings are available except to tell me they are homemade. They didn't see homemade.

The kids pizza had literally no cheese. It was entirely sauce that looked like ketchup and a few specks of cheese. The caesar salad had no dressing and the portobello mushrooms had zero flavor and were covered with what felt like sand. The spaghetti was missing the mushrooms. Switched the kids pizza to kids pasta with butter and it came out hard and stuck together in some sort of pink water. I didn't make my kid eat it. We wanted to leave as fast as possible. We left most of or meal unfinished. Fellow diners looked equally disgusted as us. I felt like I was on candid camera or something.

Take y advice and stay away. I dont know what happened to this place but when you can get a better salad at East Side marios, you know you are in trouble. This restaurant is an embarrassment to the area, it is THAT bad. Not sure how it is even still open. DO NOT GO HERE. Owners should be ashamed to put that type of food on tables."}
{"text":"Food gets 4 stars, it was delicious. But the service was atrocious.
We were often sitting there waiting for the server to return. Waited for 20 mins after completing our meals for our desserts, and no server in sight. 

After dessert, waited another 20 mins to get our bill. The wait times were ridiculous, but like I said, the food was great.

I won't be returning though. One of my biggest pet peeves is waiting and not being served for a prolonged period of time"}
{"text":"I have been going to La Grotta on Main for years. Service is a hit and miss, especially on Saturday nights.. which I really suggest you to avoid.

My most recent visit was on a Sunday when there were only 2 tables including us and with 1 waiter and we received excellent and friendly services.

They do have dinner special set menu for either $30 or $40 person which includes an appetitizer/main/dessert. Unfortunately, since I am using one of those deals, so I have to order from the regular menu.

Seafood Pasta always excellent and the mussels were meaty and fresh!! Veal Parimigiana was nice and tender and moist! 

Nice waiter more than happy to cut up a mega piece of Tiramisu for us to serve..  However, the roast for the Cafe Latte is just a little weak for my taste.

The deco is nice and pleasing... but one might feel catastrophic because the ceiling is quite low and not too many windows... but it does feel cozy though!

Accept all credit cards!!"}
{"text":"This place tries, very hard, to be an upscale Italian restaurant, but fails, equally as hard, in doing so. 

The location for a restaurant like this cannot be better. You would think that the ownership who are paying thousands to have this location would capitalize on this but they don't. 

Food is below average. Came for a function. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Unlike other people's experience,my fiancé and I had a lovely time at La Grotta. The owner was actually quite friendly and the service was good. He made some good suggestions and eventually we selected the risotto with mushroom, chicken and sundried tomatoes. It was amazing. Best risotto I've ever had. Quite a good selection of wine. As per other people's experience, I could see where the owner could become flustered. However, nice people get treated nicely; simply stated but true. The ambiance wasn't the greatest and I did make a joke that this restaurant should be on kitchen nightmares. Not because of the food, but the space. With little changes I'm sure La Grotta can be an awesome restaurant for everyone to enjoy in Unionville. 

P.S: if you like spices, try the owners special chillies in olive oil...AMAZING!"}
