{"text":"We were just there tonight. Had a reservation at 7:30pm. Didn't get drinks for over half an hour and only two other tables in the restaurant had people at them. By 9:15pm we finally got our food and the chicken was all rubbery and overcooked and not even hot. Fries were gross. 

That's not the worst part. The owner was actually really nice but very inexperienced. He told us not to pay and he would give us free strudel to take home. We got up to put our coats on and this table of 5 hipsters (who had clearly been over served with alcohol) started verbally assaulting us, yelling and screaming for us not eating our food and not paying. Yelling profanities at us and two of the guys got up and tried to attack my husband. I'm pregnant so he tried to defend me and we tried to get out of there without getting beat up. 

We tried phoning several times to let the owner know what happened since he was in the back at the time and no one answered the phone. We are completely appalled and disgusted. We will never be returning and by the wait times and the quality of food I can't say they will be open long. Which is sad because there are no good German places in this city."}
{"text":"Went with a group of people for an early birthday dinner on a Friday evening. The restaurant was out of \"dry\" red wine to start and ran out of their signature Friday night special beer before our table was even served our meals. Given that beer and wine are the only alcoholic beverages available, our group found this really quite unacceptable. 

Then came the food (after a very long wait). The schnitzel was basic and those served without any sauce were very dry. The spatzle was also dry, chewy and flavourless. The currywurst was decent, but when I asked for mayo for my fries (traditional pairing in Germany, not unusual for Canada), I was scoffed at, but eventually received a dollop. Given the low quality of the food, the meals were quite over-priced.

Finally, the two servers that evening stood by the kitchen talking to one-another a lot and were very slow to check in on our table, causing drinks to run dry for very long periods of time. I would not go back and wouldn't recommend this experience to anyone."}
{"text":"We had such high hopes for this restaurant because there are very few German restaurants in the city. We were excited to see some beers that you don't find readily and they were each served in their proper glasses on matching coasters which is important in German beer culture. 

The decor is decidedly NOT German. We didn't feel like we were in a German style place at all and there was no smell of food in there either which seemed odd for a restaurant. 

The menu features almost all schnitzel dishes...not much of anything else other than currywurst with fries and some bratwurst. We ordered one of each of those to share on our table as appetizers and also ordered a schnitzel dish each and cheese spatzle as an extra side. Soup or salad comes with the schnitzels.

We waited and waited and were not served anything for quite some time. I started thinking they were going to serve everything we ordered at once, so I went and made sure the waitress was going to bring our appetizer dishes first. She said yes. Shortly thereafter, she came out with our entres. We told them to just forget about the appetizers and we also asked where our soup/salad was. The waitress said 'oh, sorry' and brought those out after our entres. 

The schnitzels were very breaded and dry...thick with coating...like they were bought frozen, already breaded. Each had a flavorless sauce on them (3 different ones at our table) and 2 of us actually put their soup on top of the schnitzel to give it some flavor. We suspected the sauces served were made from Knorr packets. The yogurt dressing on the salad was actually just plain yogurt slopped on top. Everything was an epic fail as far as service and food went. I don't think you can smell food cooking when you come in because they are actually not cooking in there.  If you're wanting a German beer, go here and hope for ok service but do not go here to eat. We left disappointed and angry."}
{"text":"Truly excellent. We have been looking for a good German restaurant ever since the German Canadian club shut down theirs. The Schnitzel was delicious and the spatzel was perfect."}
{"text":"Mmmmm. Championshnitzel was great! I have never had Schnitzel before so it was a pleasant surprise. Nice side of rosemary potatoes. Server Jessica was great, very friendly. Salad was fairly small but tasty"}
{"text":"Really good food but wait time was crazy long. Also prices were high but again very good quality and delicious."}
{"text":"Great experience on opening night! We had two Jaegerschnitzel (one each pork and chicken) and one Gorgonzola Schitzel. Sides were fries, Spaetzle and some absolutely fantastic cream of broccoli soup. Everything was delicious- Schnitzel were all tender and perfectly cooked, fries were excellent, the Spaetzle was gorgeous. We all had the same desert, the vanilla pudding with whipped cream and fresh fruit (kiwi for now)- delectable, not too sweet. Some Koelsch and grapefruit Radler and a couple of dry Rieslings. Service was friendly but given it was opening night quite slow, but I'm sure they'll work it out."}
{"text":"I was here with a group of six recently and while our server was friendly, service was pretty slow and she hardly checked on our table.  My spouse noted he didn't have a chance to ask for ketchup during our meal.  He could have gotten his rump out of the chair to ask, but we were seated at an awkward area of the restaurant where he and I had to semi climb over a bench to leave the table.  

Honestly, no one raved about the food.  Some said it was good, some said it was bland.  I have German heritage and some bland food is part of the deal.  However, I ordered the German meatballs and they were overcooked.  Not quite charcoal, but close.  I was really hoping they'd taste like my grandma's meatballs.  Next to the Edelweiss Imports cafe (which does have meatballs like my grandma's), this is the second closest experience I've had in Calgary.  Veggies were good though.  

I'd say the prices are reasonable and I liked the decor.  I can't see myself returning unless someone else made the choice for me."}
{"text":"Nice people and a legitimately authentic German menu (unlike Wurst which is more like a Earls / hard rock cafe version of a german restaurant). Schnitzel's are great - Jagr especially.  Spaetzl, and fried potatoes are great.  Fries need real work though - not crispy, nor tasty.  Desserts very good.  Soup excellent.  

Good German beers are $9.50 a pint though.  I mean I know it costs more to import them but, ....  lower the price to $7 and I'll be your best customer!"}
