{"text":"Excited to try this place. The decor and finishes are very nice.  The Pittsburgh Fries appetizer was excellant.  All good ends there.  Service was poor.  All the empty plates etc were allowed to pile up on our table.  Water glasses never refilled.  Hamburgers were overcooked.  Not going back for a meal. Bar seemed cool.  IT is a hotel restaurant after all.  No need to go back."}
{"text":"Met a friend for drinks, and they were delicious.  The setting was classy and very comfortable. Everyone was very friendly. Our server, Daniel, was very helpful and attentive. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Basic chain restaurant food. Nothing too exciting on menu. Food served without garnished or anything colorful on plates. Very few diners. Lovely space for hopelessly underused."}
{"text":"Callie is a great and very professional (and fun) bartender. What a treasure they have here.  And the hotel is super high design too, so a pleasant surprise. I never knew about Indigo before this stay."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a Wednesday night. I had a burger and a wedge salad. Both were very good. The hotel and restaurant are new and very attractive. The staff were quite nice. We will return."}
{"text":"To start, Callie was fabulous. She had the right amount of humor and professionalism. She was very knowledgeable about the beers they serve and helped us order the best available to suit our tastes.   She also provided good advice as far as meal choices. Callie was attentive to our desires and was genuinely concerned we enjoyed our meal.   The beer cheese fries were to die for, plain and simple. I ordered the flat iron steak medium-well and it was nearly perfect. The chili was OK, I prefer it with bigger meat chunks. Also, the mac & cheese was OK.   My wife had the spinach sale with chicken and says it was also very good. There is something different about the vinaigrette dressing which was very good.   The tiramisu was FANTASTIC!  I've not had it with fresh berries before and they synced perfectly.   In all, I'm very happy we made the choice to eat here. It was great."}
{"text":"To plainly put it, Wallace's TapRoom and the Indigo Hotel is beautiful. Before I got there, I knew it was going to be on the nicer end of restaurants, but definitely not as elegant as it is.  The restaurant was surprisingly near-empty when I came, even for a Tuesday night. The service, while very friendly, was fairly slow that night, which I did not mind in the slightest. When we paid at the end, the sever never came to pick up our check so we ended up paying at the bar. However, I understand that since this is a hotel restaurant, service isn't exactly going to be quick and the restaurant could've possibly been short-staffed that night.  The food and drinks were wonderful. I had a Mai Tai 1944 and it was the perfect concoction of sweetness with a kick. For the food, I ordered their burger with the caramelized onions, bacon, and horseradish with a side of fries. Both were delicious! I normally do not like horseradish, but I actually enjoyed the horseradish paired with the burger.  Overall, Wallace's is a lovely place with great food and drinks for pretty reasonable prices. I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. At our table we had a burger, a salad and the chicken waffle sammies. The appetizer wasn't as exciting as I expected. The service was a little bit slow, but the hostess and waitress we're both extremely friendly. There were a lot of drink options with and without whiskey."}
{"text":"Nice brunch. The croissant was really good, fresh orange juice and reaaaally good bacon!"}
{"text":"Ate here after a Yelp Community event. The Restaurant is on the first floor of the hotel. There is great street parking after 6pm. It's nice and clean. There was a nice variety on the menu. I couldn't choose between the meatball sliders or the loaded fries. I got the sliders and the side of spinach hoping to be at least a little healthy. The spinach was sooo good. Cooked just right and had the perfect amount of spices. The meatball sliders were ok. I liked how big they were---pretty thick meatballs, however, I felt as if the spice could have been kicked up a notch. The fixings on the sliders were pretty good, just would have loved a more unique meatball. I'll probably get the loaded fries next time.   Our waitress was really nice. She seemed to be waiting on all of the tables in the restaurant, but she was still prompt, helpful and humorous.   Be sure to check-in when you arrive at this place, Yelp gives you a nice 20% off!"}
{"text":"I had to go to Wallace's one more time before I could write an accurate review. I went for a Yelp event, brunch, and now breakfast. The Yelp event was wonderful, so we convinced friends to join us for brunch. The brunch was okay, but wasn't what I wanted. I didn't realize the brunch and breakfast menus were so different and had my heart set on the stuffed French toast. I ended up ordering the seafood omelet and it was mediocre. Nothing else that was ordered at my table was better than okay. All the food was edible and some plates were finished, but it wasn't anything special.   Okay, so I still want to try Wallace's again because my first experience was great. We head there for breakfast. I finally order the stuffed french toast! And agree to split the french toast and a veggie skillet. They're both very good, but smaller than expected. The stuffed french toast is also no longer \"stuffed\" and instead just spread with a strawberry cream cheese. It was very good, but not as good as it had been the night I first tried it. It was a better experience than the time I went for brunch, but again, I don't think it was that special.   I think Wallace's could really benefit from a few changes.  breakfast and brunch menus are ridiculously small to be separate menus and should really be one menu that is available at all time. The service is usually good in the morning, but I did have one or two peculiar interactions."}
{"text":"My friend said the Mother's Day brunch was amazing so I decided to take my husband here for Father's Day. What a disappointment. Buttermilk  pancakes were good but so small and too expensive for their size. My seafood omelet wasn't prepared well. No flavor with just some blas√© shrimp inside. This venue might be ok for visitors from out of town willing to pay for breakfast in house but not for this breakfast lover who has been to numerous great spots for breakfast in this city"}
{"text":"In Pittsburg at the new Hotel Indigo. I very really eat hotel food and usually venture out. I decided to try this restaurant and this place exceeded my expectations. First I had dinner and noticed that the hotel goes to  local sources every day for their food. This farm to table concept is amazing. I had some fresh salmon that was amazing, but the appetizers were great. You must try their signature French fries smothered in cheese and rib meat along with a great dipping sauce. Dinner was so good, I decided to try breakfast. I ordered eggs and couldn't believe the taste of these eggs. The experience overall was great and they have a sweet looking bar as well. The downside is when people finally discover this place, there will be a wait. Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"A group of us had dinner at Wallace's Tap Room on a weeknight. The place was absolutely deserted, and it didn't take us long to learn why. In fact, there was only one other table in the restaurant during our entire visit.   Even so. Even so. It took an interminable amount of time for us to order drinks and an even longer time for us to receive the drinks. We were actually able to see our drinks sitting on the bar, and half of our table voted to just go retrieve them ourselves, but eventually they did appear at our table. Unfortunately, not a single drink was delivered to the person who ordered it, and one of the drinks was not actually ordered by anyone at the table. When questioned, the waiter incorrectly identified ALL of the cocktails and stated that their placement was correct. I mean. It was actually sort of a feat of mathematics to get them all wrong.   Our waiter was courteous, pleasant, and clearly meant well. We were his first table. Ever. He appeared to have had no training and no other staff member appeared to assist him, oversee what he was doing, or to check on our table. This lead to some really interesting moments. Like when he filled our wine glasses with water and then left the empty water glasses on the table for the duration of the meal. When we ordered items from the very abbreviated menu and he needed us to point each of them out so he could read them from the menu in order to write them down. When someone in our party ordered a Caesar side salad and what arrived at the table was a garden salad with a side of Caesar dressing.   Appetizers were uninspired in every way. Deviled eggs sounded creative (spicy bacon, mustard, & pickled beet) but came to the table looking and tasting pretty unimpressive, sitting on a limp bed of microgreens. The pierogies were a pretty deep embarrassment, because, you know, this is the kind of city where you ought to be able to produce a decent pirogi if you really want to. Or get lessons from a church lady, or something. These were cold, tough, swimming in too much sour cream, and tasteless.   With our crew, it's pretty rare when nobody wants to taste their neighbor's dish, but nobody tried to snag any of the meatloaf, roasted half chicken, corned beef, or burger.  The burger was probably the best choice, with lots of lettuce/tomato/onion and blue cheese. While the corned beef (not what was actually ordered, but, oh well, at this point, I just ate it) itself was clearly of good quality, the temperature was erratic (warm on the outside, cold in the middle) and the sandwich was served on a weirdly doughy rye, with a grainy, tasteless \"pub cheese sauce\" floating over the whole endeavor. The meatloaf was ok. The only other table in the entire restaurant during our visit recommended it. The problem was that the general approach didn't much distinguish itself from the pre-prepared version of the same down at Trader Joe's. The roasted chicken was reported as overcooked, dry, and tasteless.   The one item on the menu that we all agreed was pretty good? French fries. There were thick & just a little salty, a great balance between crispy and toothsome.   In general, the \"quality\" of the ingredients seemed good, fresh, and obviously there's a strong attempt to locally source ingredients. The problem is that the concept of each dish is pretty uninspired, and issues with implementation, temperature, and service just make it all worse. Overall, it just didn't seem that anyone gave a hoot about the place or its customers. Won't be back. East Liberty has a lot to offer diners these days, and it seems unlikely that Wallace's can make a go of it with this much indifference to quality & service. At this price-point, walk across the street to the Whitfield for better cocktails, better food, better service, and a better environment. That's what we did."}
{"text":"After Yelp Pittsburgh's Makers and Bakers event, my friends and I decided to stay in the hotel and grab dinner.   The decor was well designed yet casual. We sat at a horseshoe booth. The menu was simple in offerings but the choices all seemed delicious.  I ordered the Black and Gold burger with a brioche bun and carmalized onions. I got the horseradish sauce on the side. The meat was fresh and cooked to my liking. I ended up not using the horseradish sauce because I honestly forgot about it. I would order the burger again.   I also swapped the fries for a side salad of fresh greens with some some veggies and a vinegarette. The salad was so good, that I forgot to take a picture.   The service was good. The server was never knowledgeable and was able to answer my questions about menu items.   If you're in the East Liberty neighborhood and looking for a place to stop for some good food, check this place out."}
{"text":"My parents, husband and I had dinner at Wallace's TapRoom tonight and it was wonderful! The space is absolutely beautiful, the food was great and our server Daniel and every employee we came in contact with was so warm and friendly! We will definitely tell our friends about this place and come back the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"First time in Pittsburgh and I love this Hotel Indio I love this restaurant even more!! Callie at the bar is an amazing person, recommended the Beer Dip which was OMG it was soooo good. I'd come back here just for her!"}
{"text":"Sat on the reverse side of bar and the bartender said she would be with me shortly. ... 30 mins later I got a menu and was embarrassed my guest at the hotel had to wait so we bounced to a real bar. #epicfail"}
{"text":"Craft cocktails! We started our evening with the Pittsburgh loaded fries and cocktails.  The fries were exceptional,  and the drinks even moreso. I had the drink special which was made with a raspberry mint infused simple syrup- the blending was perfect! My second drink was one of my fave's, a Pinms cup. Wallace's was a fine choice,  and we will be back,  and hopefully Zeb the bartender will still be there mixing!"}
{"text":"Wallace's TapRoom left MUCH to the imagination. For starters, when I pulled up to Hotel Indigo (where Wallace's Taproom is located), I noticed some empty parking spots out front. With no valet in sight, I parked in a spot that I assumed was free to guests of the hotel/restaurant. When I walked in the lobby, I kindly asked the gentleman at the front desk if it was ok to park out front. \"Will I get towed?\" I asked, or something along those lines. \"Yes, you'll get towed. It's valet only. $6.\" OH, ok. Thanks for the warm welcome.  After moving my car across the street, a friend and I went into the restaurant for dinner and drinks. We were literally the only people in the restaurant, and kindly asked if we could sit outside. The hostess said \"well, we don't have a server outside.\" Alllrighty. We'll sit inside, no biggie. We ordered drinks and the beer cheese app - pretty good. It only took the waiter about four returns to the table to then take our entree order. I got the burger and a side of brussels. I could have made the brussels at home, and I am no chef by any means. The burger was equally as mediocre, and the bun was really soggy.   All in all, slow service, ok atmosphere, overpriced and pretentious wait staff. Oh, and may I end this by saying that I never write Yelp reviews? My experience here was just that bad."}
{"text":"I was here for a Yelp event and later went with a large group of friends for a weekend brunch.  I didn't even realize this was here until the Yelp event, and I think they added the outside sign only recently.  It's not obvious from the street that there is a restaurant here, since the area by the window looks like it could just be part of a hotel lobby.  The hours listed on their website are wrong--they serve brunch on weekends until 2pm.  The restaurant was empty almost the whole time we were there (for an 11am brunch on a Saturday) and it seemed that the wait staff were not used to having such a large party.  Most of the food items we had were excellent, though the chilaquiles were a bit disappointing--my friend's came out with soggy chips with the thing green salsa all soaked in.  But we enjoyed all the other options, especially the carnitas and grits and the duck confit with poached eggs.  Some of the entrees are more filling than others, so that is something to keep in mind when ordering.  I think there must have only been one chef since they brought out each type of dish one at a time with 5-10 minutes passing in between before the next came out, so we weren't able to all eat together.  The drinks were all excellent.  I had a michelada which was very good despite the fact that they ran out of the shrimp garnish. My friends also tried the bellinis and the bartender's special drink I think was called the figgly wiggely, which was an excellent and unique beverage that was just the right amount of sweetness, and garnished with real figs.  They also have a special blend of coffee from Zeke's nearby (a local coffee roaster), which is excellent.  The prices are reasonable, the wait staff are very friendly, and the atmosphere is very clean, modern, and spacious.  Since this is a new place that isn't used to having large groups I'm giving them a generous rating since I think these other issues will improve as they are open longer and have more business.  I think it's definitely work checking out."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here.  Excellent service.  Pretty room.  Did a mixture of small plates and cocktails.  Will be back."}
{"text":"We came to Hotel Indigo for a YELP Makers and Bakers event and decided to have dinner here afterwards. We ordered the Cheese Board, the Meat Board, and the Black and Gold Burger with fries. Their menu shows who the local vendors are that they get their food from. I really liked that. We ordered the Cheese Board, the Meat Board, and the Black and Gold Burger with fries.  The Black and Gold burger was a hit with our group. It was cooked perfectly. It has a horseradish sauce that gives the burger a tangy zing. The fries were fresh cut and fresh cooked. You don't get fries like that very often. I would have liked a side of the horseradish sauce to dip the fries in. YES!  It's THAT good.  The Meat Board had 3 types of meat-a kielbasa, prosciutto, and a type of salami. It had a small dish of stoneground mustard. Plus it had a side of crisps. The salami was my favorite. It was the most flavorful. The board was made up with nice portion sizes.  The Cheese Board had a Double Blue, a white cheddar, and a 3rd choice that I can't remember the name of. Sorry. It had a nice offering of fig jam and a small bowl of honey. Like the Meat Board, it came with crisps. By ordering both boards we were able to mix and match all kinds of bites. The honey brought sweet while the mustard brought savory.  Our server Samantha was very friendly. She told us about how great their Happy Hours (5-7pm) were great. They offer half off of their appetizers and $2 off of cocktails. She told us on Thursday nights during Happy Hour that they have live music. We definitely want to bring some friends and check that out.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I were out and about with our dog and we were looking for a place to grab a drink and a bite to eat. Enter Wallace's taproom. Absolutely positively 100% dog friendly. Our dog isn't one of those 2 pound designer purse dogs either. He's 100 pounds of Rottweiler/Akita goofiness, yet we walked him right up to the bar and we were welcomed with open arms (and a bag of dog treats!)   We ended up choosing a table outside. We were tended to immediately and our pup was given a bowl of water.   My Sliberty Swizzle was delicious. My husband's Pimm's Cup was undrinkable with way too much tartness. He had them add extra ginger ale and that solved the problem.  The food was pretty good, albeit a bit uninspired. I ordered the pierogi appetizer and the spinach salad. The pierogi were yummy. My spinach salad was supposed to come tossed with shaved Brussels sprouts and there were maaaaybe two in there. Still good though. The husband got deviled eggs and a grilled corned beef and cheese sandwich with a side of fries. The sandwich was okay. Honestly, the French fries and spicy bacon deviled eggs were the winners of the meal.   I was very excited to discover that there's a Yelp check-in offer for 20% off your bill (especially since the prices are a bit on the higher end for what they are offering). That's a great Yelp deal!   Although the food and drinks were a solid 3 star \"A-Ok\", I'm throwing in an extra star for the service and for being so accommodating with our dog."}
{"text":"I went to see a friend perform live music and eat some dinner.  The music was great but I can't comment on the food because I was unable to get a waitress to wait on us.  The manager came by to pour us water.  He told us that they were a bit understaffed but he would send a waitress right over.  She never came.  We were there for an hour and a half and not a single person came by.  I will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"I think Wallace's is pretty great.  I will preface this review by saying I've only been here for happy hour and haven't had a full meal at the restaurant.  I went here for a Monday night happy hour.  It was a great deal with their drafts (lots of crafts and locals) 1/2 off and their appetizers 1/2 off.  I had the pierogi.  I was expecting Mrs. T's or the like, so my bar was set really low.  I was pleasantly surprised that they seemed to be home made and were really tasty.  Service was quick and the bartender was really polite.    NOTE:  they are 100% dog friendly.  Want to bring your pet to the bar?  That's allowed.  This may be a plus or a minus in some people's eyes."}
{"text":"Nice looking small place in indiego hotel.  Went to hear some music and get dinner.  Food was good,  calamari, fish tacos,  shrimp and grits.  Music was good.  Parking was easy, in fact several places close and I was right in front of door.  Service needed work."}
{"text":"We visited this place for Mother's Day (although we were there for dinner and not brunch). Very confusing experience. The host and waiter were very nice. But the food took forever to be delivered to us, and they got almost everything on our order wrong. My son ordered grape soda and he got cherry, my kids ordered plain burgers or burgers without certain condiments, and they came with all the condiments, the appetizer was supposed to come with bread but we had to ask for it because it wasn't delivered to our table. Also, my husband and I both ordered brussel sprouts for our side, but they looked completely different on our plates - his came nearly charred to death, blackened and mushy, whereas mine were much less cooked and nearly twice as large, and very green.  The drink list was nice, and we enjoyed the beverages. My half chicken was also very good. We might come back for a cocktail sometime to see whether things are running better, but I don't think we'll come back again for a meal."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends - excited to try out the fancy new hotel's restaurant. After all, if Ace Hotel's Bar/Restaurant is so popular, why not Indigo's as well? Maybe we'll discover something big!  The restaurant was pretty much empty, only a couple sat at the bar, one person at a booth, and then my group of friends. The place is pretty clean, obviously new, and had a bit of that nice luxury hotel floral scent thing going on. All of that said, it still felt kind of uninspired, and very much like a hotel restaurant that is trying to be massively appealing and unoffensive.  The cocktails we got were actually pretty good. Not the best in town, but all respectably made. The local/custom cocktails all appeared like they'd be a bit too sweet, having lots of soda ingredients, sugar, honey, etc, but when we actually got them, they were surprisingly well balanced, unique, and pleasant.  Unfortunately, the food was a bit disappointing. Vegetarian menu options are pretty limited, and most of the options have to be requested without bacon to be made vegetarian. I got the pierogies - they were good, but nothing to rave about. They may well have been Mrs T's brand - prepared just right - but nothing super special. Not like Church Brew Works or Harris Grill.  Two friends got the salmon. The one who ordered a side salad ended up with just a piece of cooked salmon all alone on a huge plate. No sauce. No decorations, no parsley sprig. No bed of mashed potatoes or rice or anything... Just. Lonely. Overcooked. Salmon.  Weird. She was not impressed.  The mac-n-cheese was pretty mediocre. My friend said the same of his chili. The roasted vegetables were pretty nice - buttery and perfectly cooked.  The tiramisu was actually pretty delicious - probably the best thing we ordered.  Overall, I wouldn't be rushing back to eat here. There are much better options in walking distance of the hotel for people staying in East Liberty - Union Pig & Chicken across the street is excellent, Spoon, BRGR, and Fire Side Public House just a bit down the street seems to be trying to do a similar thing, but is doing it better in a more interesting environment.  I may be interested in checking out their draught beer selection next time. It may be a good clean quiet alternative to, say, Kelly's or Sharp Edge.  With so many good, competitive options in quick walking distance, I think Indigo is really going to have to find something that stands out for the neighborhood if they want to attract enough locals to fill the place up. How about an amazing gourmet Indian restaurant? Or Latin American Fusion? Spanish Tapas?"}
{"text":"I like the layout of the bar/lounge and restaurant. We stopped in for happy hour and decided to sit in the lounge area on very comfortable sofas. The happy hour specials are pretty nice: half off apps and beers on tap and certain wines. Cocktails $2 off. I'll start by saying that the service was fast and friendly and our drinks and food came right away. The meatball sliders have a zesty kick and are very juicy. Cheeseboard with crostini and crackers was typical but good. Pimm's Cup was refreshing and flavorful as was the Moscow Mule. In addition to happy hour pricing, we were able to get an additional 20% off by checking in on Yelp. This was a pleasant first time visit and would go back again,"}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day brunch yesterday with my husband and our little one.  When we arrived we couldn't figure out what was going on with parking. There was no clear signage regarding valet or anything else, so we got lucky and found on street parking across the street. Then we entered through the street entrance which apparently is not the main entrance which was strange and we didn't know where to check in for our reservation. Luckily someone came over quickly and asked us if we had a reservation.   We were then taking to our table which was a nice semi circular both with 2 chairs. Then the service commenced with its weirdness. We did not have a dedicated waiter which made requests difficult. No one really explained what was included regarding drinks other than the included mimosa self serve station. Luckily my husband asked the woman who sat us for his juice because we were not asked if we wanted anything else to drink (non-alcoholic) from the bar other than by the bartender who repeatedly reminded us that the bar was ala carte(once is appreciated more often is an insult). Service overall was strange and plates were not cleared in a timely manner though I believe this was the first time they have done a buffet of sorts so I would definitely go back and see what service is like in a regular night.   Onto the food. The brunch was a buffet with many options including charcuterie, salad, pastries, bacon, sausage, French toast, pancakes, seafood gratin, pork tenderloin, prime rib, an omelets station,  and a dessert station. The food was wonderful. Everything was fresh tasting and the only thing that really suffered from being in chafing dishes was the French toast and pancakes. I really enjoyed the pork tenderloin which normally suffers from being precooked and sitting in a chafing dish,  but in this case was a perfectly moist and delicious peice. The desserts were also stellar and I really enjoyed all of the different macaron that they had, though it was difficult to determine what flavors some of them were. The included mimosa bar was also fun to play with including many juices,  nectars,  syrups,  and garnishes to make your drink just how you liked.   Overall the food definitely made up for the strange and inconsistent service. I will definitely be back to try some of their regular menu items."}
{"text":"The brunch food is pretty close to 4-star food, and the interior is so bright and spacious! Having never been there, I was pleased by the lovely food presentation and the cute design of the restaurant.    With a few tweaks the experience at Wallace's could be a lot better:  1) the small brunch menu could be a bit more balanced.  It really, really needed a few more healthy and/or vegetarian options: even the pancakes had bacon-whipped cream.  A veggie/customizable omelette seems like an easy add. The only veg item on the menu was the chilaquiles, which were tasty but, again, needed to be better balanced; it only had one egg on a huge pile of fried chips.  They definitely should add a second egg and perhaps a side of fruit.    2) the brunch menu should be online--the website doesn't even list that they serve brunch or the hours, I believe (do they hate making money? I really don't get it). No wonder it was pretty close to empty.    3) Brunch cocktail specials or chalkboard signs outside indicating they are open might also drum up some business.    I left a bit puzzled by some of their business and menu choices, because this place is cute and in a good East End location.  Hopefully they can work out the kinks.    Overall, a tasty and pleasant experience.  Others should check it out."}
{"text":"This place was awful. It was empty when I got there, it took forever to get a drink and when I finally did, I didn't see my waiter again for at least 20 minutes. When my friend Arrived, no one ever came to take her order. I tried to go into the bar to close my tab for the lack of service and the bartender and manager both told me they couldn't help me and I had to wait for my server. I had 1 drink in an hour. Finally my waiter came out, didn't apologize, and gave me my check and quickly walked away. I would give it less than 1 star if I could. Don't waste your time."}
