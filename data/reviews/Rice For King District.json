{"text":"Very disappointing. At 8$ for a sub, I was expecting more than just pork, tripe (surprise!), and carrots on bread, with a clump of mushy green onions in the middle. Extremely dry as it had no sauce of any kind. My husbands satay beef sub was a bit better, but still just beef, carrots, and a bit of sauce. We were excited to have a new Vietnamese restaurant close to us,  but we'll stick with harvest hills. Food was fresh,  restaurant was nice although it was takeout so I don't know how good the service is. Just very underwhelming, overpriced food."}
{"text":"Sunday out & decided to check out this new location for lunch. BIG mistake! I ordered to go so I could take it home & sit on the deck.  Here is how it went.  I ordered from one of the vermicelli \"specialties\" with spring roll, beef, chicken & \"grilled shrimp\" what I got was dried out over cooked meats that were likely 3 or 4 days leftover, ice cold vermicelli, and shrimp pieces that were cooked beyond recognition. The spring roll was good but other than that just disgusting! There was so much salt and or MSG that my lips & tongue were burning.  I also ordered a side of deep fried won tons, they were the size of a loonie with pea sized meat served with a packaged sauce rather than the nice home made dipping sauce shown on the menu.  All this for $20.00! I might as well taken the money & thrown that in the garbage. Never again!"}
{"text":"I love this location! The staff are always smiling and sweet. This is my absolute favourite pho around and I have it 2 to 3 times a week. It's the only place I find that is consistent with their quality including meat. I dislike many places cause they use fatty and gross meat in the pho. I'm maybe a but to picky about my meat but I'm a former vegetarian. I haven't had the subs yet, but I live their vermicelli dishes as well. Bubble tea is delicious and I still need to try the iced coffee, it's a must I hear! You also get 10% off when you do take out so that's a nice bonus!"}
{"text":"The food is good and very quick.  The staff are friendly and we had great customer service when we had an error on our ship the dishes order, they gave us a complimentary appetizer to make up for it."}
{"text":"Overall it's pretty good. Great variety of soup and rice dishes. Portions could be bigger. The prices are way too high. 12.00$ for a bowl of Pho ! Too much. The only reason why I have come back is convenient location. Plus the people are friendly."}
{"text":"Ended up coming her again to give them a second chance as a colleague who lives nearby frequently pops in to grab food to go and said as of late the food has gotten better.   NOPE, hard pass! It has not gotten better! It's still the same shit food at premium prices.  My kids love viet subs and we will often drive out to Nolan hill to Pho Sate to get some, even though it's a good 15 min out of my way, these people know how to make a sub.  I call in an order for pick up for 2 subs and I asked what came in the subs as each viet place slightly differs. They say it comes with the meat, carrots, cucumbers and cilantro and some sub spread, I assume the sauce.   Well I completely agree and can attest that fellow yelper Erica is spot on in saying it came on a stale bun, meat and carrots- nothing else! For almost $9 I'd rather have subway! It was awful and my kids were so disappointed because they have sophisticated palates and will not eat garbage, which is what this sub was!   Don't tell your clients one thing and pull a switcheroo when they come to pick up and then act like you're doing me a favour by giving me a 10% pick up when outside on your window it clearly states that all pick up orders will receive 10% off!   Piss of, people running businesses like this is the reason people should not tip on pick up!  Ended up throwing them away and driving to pho Sate in Nolan hill for some real traditional viet subs for more than $1 cheaper.  Never again, I should have stayed away after the first shitty incident, but always will give someone e a second chance- there will never be a third! Way to lose a customer forever!"}
