{"text":"Ehh, place was kinda shabby . guys in back were kinda un clean looking.... Yeah, we actually didn't even order. We left."}
{"text":"Love the fold overs here!! The pizza is also great, really like their sauce and crust! On Sundays if you bring little kids they will bring the kids to the kitchen to make your pizza! I don't know if they still do this, but just ask!"}
{"text":"Great little pizza joint.  The pies and especially the foldovers are delicious!!!!  More of a delivery/takeout place but they do have a small dining room.  I would suggest calling in a pickup order.  Try the chicken foldover.  It will change your life."}
{"text":"I didn't care for the pepperoni pizza we ordered. The toppings including cheese were very stiff and all fell off in one big piece. Even when we pulled a slice out of the box all you got was the bread and the toppings were stiff stuck inside the box to the neighboring piece of pizza. I gave it three stars because it could of been worse but it just wasn't very tasteful. I also ordered the Hawaiian pizza which was tasteful but the toppings did the same thing as the pepperoni pizza. My 9yr old said the pepperonis are way too spicy but then again she's 9. Could of been worse but I just don't think I'll order from here again. Other than the stiff toppings falling off maybe it's just not my type of pizza? I hate giving negative reviews but everyone has their preference of pizza and i guess it just wasn't my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! There were 5 of us having a fun halloween night in. We ordered a half sheet with pineapple and bacon! None of us were disappointed! Sauce was great! Pizza was on point! We would order from here again for sure! Our order was ready on time and crust was nice and thick! Yummmmm!!"}
{"text":"Nice old school style pizza joint. Ordered from here multiples times never have had any issues."}
{"text":"You're better off getting a frozen pizza. This is the most disgusting, tasteless pizza I've ever had! We ordered one deluxe, one pepperoni and one order of breadsticks. Sauce is so thin, it's like tomato juice but without the flavor. They use canned mushrooms instead of fresh so they are slimy and give the pizza a very low quality taste. I couldn't even finish one slice. Dominos on their worst day is better than this place. Needless to say, we will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Ive been eating Attilio's pizza on and off for 11 years. One of the few pizzerias left in the area, Ive never had a bad pie. I love the crust and sauce, and it always hits the spot."}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza. The place looks a but sketchy, but the employees are kind, pizza is the best in town."}
{"text":"All of their pizza, the garlic bread, chicken foldover, eggplant parmesan sandwich... I love it all.  They also have a killer catering menu for any parties or hoedowns you may need to throw.  Great coupons and the staff are always friendly.  Love."}
