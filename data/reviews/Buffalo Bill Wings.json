{"text":"Have been waiting 2 hours for my food. Still haven't gotten it. Called to ask what the hold up is about and apparently there is only one driver. Waste of my time."}
{"text":"Je me suis acheté une friteuse dernièrement, et je voulais voir la qualité des ailes de poulet de chez Buffalo Bill, pas loin de chez moi.  Quand j'ai goûté à ma première aile de poulet, j'étais convaincu que je donnerais pas plus qu'une étoile dans ma critique ici. Non mais, c'pas compliqué faire des ailes de poulet, pis si t'es un restaurant qui se spécialise là-dedans, messemble que la première chose qui doit être bon chez vous, c'est bien des ailes de poulet.  Non, ça ressemble aux ailes de poussin trop cuites des Cages aux Sports; mais aux moins les sauces sont meilleures chez Buffalo Bill.   Je déteste ça quand les ailes de poulet sont trop cuite, pas juteuse. C'est loin des grosses ailes de poulet juteuses de Chez Serge.  C'est ce que je fais quand je critique un restaurant; je compare avec ce que j'ai vu de mieux.   Et l'ambiance d'un resto trop éclairé, qui te fait penser que t'es chez le dentiste ou dans une clinique, je déteste ça. C'est laid, t'as pas le goût de rester là. C'est grave quand tu vois un resto pis que tu dis que le McDo pas loin à l'air d'un 3 étoiles Michelin à comparer.  Pas grave, j'habite pas loin, donc j'pensais pas passer mes vacances ici.   Mais leur sandwich Philly est plus que mangeable, je l'ai même aimé, c'est pourquoi je donne deux étoiles, pas une; mais jamais je vais remanger des ailes de poulet là-bas, j'vais les faire moi-même. ;-)"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and pick the food up yourself if possible. Their delivery takes at least an hour, no matter how close you live. Once the food finally arrives it is either cold or they've forgotten something more often than not."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would.  All food was burnt beyond recognition and not consumable at all."}
{"text":"Best wings in town? Hell yeaaa. So saucy & juicy however the french fries are really not good .. sometimes when we order in I make my own fries at home! I think they need to kick it up a notch."}
{"text":"Always a terrible experience with their service. This was the worst.   I received a call (an hour and a half after placing my order...) from the driver, who immediately started yelling at me because I work in a big building. He said he didn't have time to come in and go to my floor. He ranted and ranted about how he doesn't have time for this, so DEMANDED that I come downstairs and meet him outside. Normally, I wouldn't mind meeting a delivery man downstairs, but the way he was yelling at me was uncalled for. Especially when I wrote in the notes specifically where I work and that it's a big building and how to get to my office (which is actually not complicated at all.) All of this is on the receipt for him to see (from just-eat.ca) Why couldn't they just call me after receiving my order to tell me that they won't deliver here? I would have understood and just gone somewhere else to eat.  I went downstairs to meet him and told him that his attitude was really unnecessary. He continued yelling at me as I walked away... very professional... I told him I'd be speaking to the owners. Unfortunately, I tried calling the restaurant to make a complaint, but no answer. I doubt it would matter anyways...  The food's not even that great either. It used to be so much better with old management. The only thing that's good is the sauce, really.  I am officially done with this place."}
{"text":"Malgré les affiches de prix qui ne concordent logiquement pas, une clarté inexistante lors des commandes et une attente inexplicable pour recevoir celle-ci, le résultat reste assez intéressant!  De petites ailes juteuses (hot) accompagnées d'une sauce au fromage bleu, un plaisir à s'en souiller la barbe!  Extra : Philly cheese steak en accompagnement pour les gourmands, un must.  *frites passablement mangeable  Ps. Petit conseil, prendre pour emporter. Déjà l'attente dans la salle est une expérience en soi."}
{"text":"Pretty good for fast food wings.  The 911 sauce is FIREBALL, so you might want to lay off that."}
{"text":"We ordered Buffalo Bills this evening and we asked for white meat pieces and offered to pay extra if we had to, they showed up with only dark meat chicken and when the delivery guy realized we would complain he ran away with the money, we called to complain and the manager simply said he sent us white meat pieces even though there were no breasts or wings, he refused to admit he was wrong, and did nothing about the driver running away, my suggestion never eat there"}
{"text":"It is a very good restaurant,  deliveries can be late sometimes.  It is not the end of the world."}
{"text":"It took over 2h for the delivery. I called after 90 minutes and was told that it would be another 10-15 minutes. Once 20 minutes had passed, I called again and was told just another 5 minutes. When I said that the food would surely be cold when it arrives, I was just told to check the food and call them back so they could see what could be done to accommodate the issue. I was pretty dumbfounded but decided to wait. Again, once the time had elapsed, I called to cancel. I was asked to still accept the order but with a 50% rebate. I refused and was simply told thank you.   There was absolutely no attempt by the staff to be helpful and calling only resulted in the phone being set aside while several staff members spoke before coming back to me and asking that I simply wait longer.   Needless to say, I will never be ordering from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from this place several times. In each case, delivery has taken over an hour and a half and something is always incorrect on the order."}
{"text":"Ordered from Buffalo Bill Wings through Justeat.com on a whim. Got a 6\" smoked meat sandwich, 10 wings, and fries and was very very pleased. Including delivery and a tip, the total came to less than $23, very affordable. All I ordered was definitely too much for one person to eat, next time I'll probably just get either the sandwich or the wings, both are equally delicious. The service was prompt and the delivery driver, whom I spoke to on the phone and in person, was incredibly nice. I'll definitely order from Buffalo Bill Wings again."}
{"text":"We have delivery from them because they are the ones in the area that deliver until 3am and we often get the munchies late at night. But chicken is too greasy, bad quality fries , delivery takes forever, the gravy is too salty... dissapointed.   Even our cat wouldn't eat the Beef of the Philly cheesebeef"}
{"text":"So I order boneless chicken. I get chicken wings, with bone. I call back to let them know that they sent me the wrong order. They refuse to bring me what I ordered. I ask to speak to the manager and I get some rude asshole who again, refuses to fix their mistake.   Never again."}
{"text":"The food is a bit mediocre (quantity/price and quality/price) but most importantly the place is a DUMP.  It's foul and repugnant. The chairs are broken down, some of the tables' screws are gone, etc. That circus decor leaves a bad taste due to the OBVIOUS lack of maintenance of the place.  There is no handle on the door to the bathroom. There's just a big gaping hole instead. It literally looks like someone used a SWAT breaching shotgun to open the door at some point.   I wouldn't be surprised if they had roaches. The amount of cheese they put on poutines is mediocre at best. The size is sad and the fries are skinny and unsatisfying.  The wings are A-Okay though. The place itself needs major renovations. It's disgusting. All the employees sound and look depressed and miserable (which I can't blame them for - who would want to work there?)."}
{"text":"The wings are kinda small and not the best, the fries are sometimes freshly made, sometimes run down and soggy.  But it's the sauce that transforms this meal, they coat the wings in the sauce of your choice and then place them on said fries. MAGIC  Their subs and burgers are well priced and you can really stuff your face for under $10.  I've seen them in action on Super Bowl Sunday, they were running around with no sense of direction and the delivery driver was lost and kept calling back.  What I don't understand is they moved from their location on Beaumont, but  decided to rebuild the same sad and pathetic decor and furniture they had from before.  I've rarely seen people stay there and eat, so maybe if they renovated, people would actually eat in. Just take it to go, Summer is great since it's real close to Jarry Park"}
{"text":"Although the food from Buffalo Bill wings is AMAZING, there is definitely something sketchy going on with this company.  I again ordered the \"La Folie\" 30 wings, fries, crudités and 3 pop and again asked for BONELESS wings.  I confirmed Boneless with the woman twice, and the fact I ordered boneless was confirmed by the 3$ surcharge on the order.  The order arrived in 45 minutes and the receipt clearly said \"boneless\".  I opened the box, and the wings were bone-in!  This is the 2nd time I have ordered boneless wings and the 2nd time they have messed up my order.  I honestly just want to try the boneless wings! I called back and they called the restaurant who advised they were \"out of bonless wings\".  Well fine, I understand restaurants run out of product, but why not call me and let me know? Why still charge me the 3$ extra for boneless wings, but send me bone-in wings? At the very least, why not take the 3$ boneless surcharge off the bill?    They went ahead and filled my order AND charged me a 3$ surcharge for something I didn't order!  Had I been advised they were out of boneless,  I would have ordered from another restaurant, but I would have ordered from BBill again at a future date and been appreciative of their honesty.  But instead of getting what I ordered, they basically stole 3$ from me with absolutely no explanation.   Their solution was to give me a discount on my next order, but after this 2 time fiasco of not getting what I wanted and paying a pretty penny on top of it, I am pretty confident I will not order from them again. As far as I'm concerned they basically stole my 3$ and clearly feel that there's nothing wrong with that.  Shoddy company with good wings, but I don't feel like they're good enough to continue to give these crooks my hard earned money."}
{"text":"I always re-try this place hoping for a different result, but after trying their wings, fried chicken, fries, and coleslaw on a couple of occasions the final verdict is: skip it. It's edible but what's the point when you can get frozen wings from the grocery store that taste better? The only winner is their sauces - I've had a number of them and they all are the best part of the meal. It takes over an hour for delivery when they are about 10 minutes away, so unless you're really high and don't mind waiting I would find something else."}
{"text":"Disgusting.  No seriously, it was disgusting. We decided to order something besides pizza and I told my husband that Buffalo Bill Wings in Dollard Des Ormeaux is fantastic so we should try the Laval one. It does NOT COMPARE!  1. Delivery took forever, but whatever, they told us on the phone 45-60 minutes. So obviously the food will be a bit cold but we can survive.  2. Chicken tenders - Don't go to the store and buy frozen chicken tenders and then sell them to me for a super high mark up. It's disgusting. Also came with a side of gravy, a side? No, what we got was a tiny tiny cup that you get from take out sushi restaurants. One tiny cup of gravy for 4 pieces of chicken!?    3. The Original Sub - Too much bread, not enough filling, no sauce *aka* no flavor. The location in the west island could teach the Laval store a lot.   4. The Original - Italian Sub - there was NO FILLING. My husband pretty much had baguette bread with lettuce and tomato. Where was the meat? Where was the flavor?  Overall, disgusting and will never order from there again.  Again, this review has nothing to do with the delivery time because we were expecting it.  This is solely on the flavor of the food."}
{"text":"Horrible. They put no effort into anything. The delivery took almost two hours. The prices do not fit the quality. Just horrible"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Montreal to get wings. Their 911 wings have a little bit if a kick to them. However,  their specials are amazing. 12 wings, 1 footlong cheese steak, two sodas and 2 orders of fries for $21.99! Also, they easily have the best cheese steak in Montreal.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it was ridiculously slow.After an hour driver calls me and tells me he's lost. His GPS doesn't have my address, no smart phone. Had to guide him street by street to find my place. How is it possible to be a delivery guy without a functional GPS?  Wings were decent but had better. Everything was cold. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"I give -5 stars the people were rude to me I got sick 2 times once was because I am lactose intolerant and asked them if the fried pickles had cheese they said no and they did I spent a hour in the bathroom throwing up and I asked for no cheese and tomato on my sub it came with both on it I complained and the next time I called they put me on the black list so I can't order I talked to the manager cause the other person was rude I order just wings this time and I got bad food poisoning for a week felt like I was going to die witch I think they did it on purpose  so they could have killed me they were even fined by health inspectors for unsanitary environment in the past I will never ever eat there in my life again This place should be shut down for good IF YOU WANT TO GET SICK EAT THERE!!! Hope this review will help prevent people from getting sick"}
{"text":"I ordered a original cheese steak sandwich, it was not very good at all almost no cheese I couldn't see any or taste any at all for that matter. Came with 4 wings I took the 911 sauce. The wings are deep fried witch I like but are so small hardly any meat on them at all. The fries where your substandard frozen fries not very good at all.   The sauce had a little kick but not a original or amazing taste at all basicly franks red lot and viniger.  The price is descent but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I love Buffalo Bills, but I've never had a meal bother me so much.  To start, I would like to clarify that I ordered delivery to an apartment. The restaurant called me to ask if it was alright if I received a chicken breast with buffalo sauce instead of their regular breaded buffalo chicken which I had no problem with, as they contacted me very soon after I ordered which I appreciated. However... The delivery driver did not even bother to buzz the apartment, but rather, called me yelling in french about how insulted he was that I only included a $1 tip (because I had placed the order through justeat.ca) and that I'm lucky he even brought me my meal in the first place. COMPLETELY oblivious to the concept that perhaps I had more change to give him once I had received my order and that MAYBE a dollar was just the beginning. I told him this over the phone that I had more and if he'd come upstairs I'd really appreciate it and he made a spitting noise on the phone. Upon greeting him at the entrance, I was met with a rant on proper tipping for the work done and he didn't even give me a moment to let him know that I had intended on tipping him more. Tired of being yelled at, I thanked him and promptly shut the door in his face. The disappointed wasn't over yet though. My meal was THROWN into the bag, not even properly packaged, my chicken burger did NOT feature buffalo sauce and was completely disheveled in it's packaging, and I received no sauce for my popcorn chicken, no condiments, and no napkins.  Upon calling the restaurant to voice my concerns I was met with a \"I'll talk to his boss\" and that's the last that I've heard. I'm fairly disappointed because I have high regards for Buffalo Bills normally, and this is one of the most disappointing moments that I have to face regarding food.  Will not recommend, and will not order again (from this location at least)."}
{"text":"I put 1 star but this place deserves ZERO! We waited almost 2 hours for our food after calling the restaurant more than once to see where it was. The employee said 5 minutes 30 minutes before we got the food. Then he blamed the driver. When the driver finally got here, he explained he did not work for the restaurant and explained that the restaurant uses a 3rd party service. He also said that this was not the first time the restaurant tried to pin the delay on them. We tried calling the restaurant with the driver and they ignored his calls as well as ours. So long story short we did not get a discount. And we will NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN AND DONT WANT ANYONE ELSE TO EITHER. DO NOT EAT HERE! horrible experience and it ruined our plans for the night. Not to mention, the food was cold and very bland. The fries were mushy and obviously made a long time ago."}
{"text":"OK, I like spicy chicken wings. I really do and the sauce selection at BB speaks to me. I'm a \"suicide sauce\" kinda guy and enjoy this guilty pleasure once in a while, usually after sports. Now this location is rundown  ( like super sketchy) but the wings are still fried right. I wouldn't eat any else, especially not made fresh."}
{"text":"You walk in and down a few steps through a 'Funhouse' like circus décor, red, white & blue. It's pretty empty and broken down, but that's not what you came for anyways.  You come for the wings, steak subs and fried foods, from what I recall from days gone by at the fomer Pte. Claire location.  I came into this location once before and walked out without being served or even acknowledged. It seemed the same thing was about to happen on a recent evening visit, but saved by the bell or in this case I was also more patient/more hungry. To note, there is not a whole heck of a lot in the vicinity at that hour.   Once approached and spoken to by one of the two guys in the back, it was mentioned that their focus is really delivery. I get it, 2 + 2 equals delivery and not the similar undertaking...take-out.   The guy was pretty polite and I ended up ordering, their 6 chicken nuggets, which comes with fries that I subbed NC for a salad with Italian dressing freshly made and a can of what turned out to be flat Orange Crush for $4.99 plus tax.  A highlight was an extensive list of dipping sauces, with requisite hot and ultra hot varieties, but also a few unique lesser seen i.e. jerk and Thai. They recommended the spicy honey BBQ, which had a pretty unique flavour profile.  My stomach was bit topsy-turvy after scoffing it down. Dare I say, at least I did get to eat something.   This nothing-fancy place turned out to be that, but the guys were pretty polite, especially at that hour - near closing time. Perhaps, I'll stick to their signature wings or the like next time and they'll get a higher overall rating.   For the average of the two visits, but really the memories, I think I'm more than fair at three."}
{"text":"Ordered Buffalo Bills - 10 pc fried chicken with fries, slaw, and 2 pepsi.   It took an hour and a half to show up. When it did, we only received the 10 pieces of chicken. We did not receive the fries, Cole slaw, and 2 pepsi. We tried to call back, however the place was closed and no one answered.   The chicken was nothing impressive. It was flavorless, and I had to get it down with BBQ sauce. Needless to say I am very unimpressed with this place. I feel very ripped off, and will not be ordering any time soon.   I do not recommend to anyone. Go to KFC instead."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Buffalo Bill's in many years and decided to go grab a dinner pack (10 wings and fries). This place is in a sad state. No a/c on a hot sweltering day. There was nobody eating there. I believe most of their customers are through pick-up and delivery. As for the meal itself, the wings are extremely small and anorexic. The fries are not the same as in the past. Not quite sure what happened to the business but it is definitely not what it used to be."}
{"text":"Good food it's just that they take an to deliver food and I live just around 800m away. And it's like they just pour the sauce all over the place."}
