{"text":"The food was excellent.  The service was efficient.  This resturant is now on my favorits list.  The portions were huge and the fried rice was as good as any I have ever had."}
{"text":"(located in the Hilton)  Eh, I am not the biggest fan of Chinese food, having grown up eating all that delicious food my entire life.   This was our 10pm dinner, and we were too hungry and tired after a long day at CES to venture off to better things, so we settled here.  Highlights: sauteed eggplants and the pepper spared ribs."}
{"text":"I frequently stay at the Las Vegas Hilton when in town for business. On a recent trip I decided to leave the room and try Garden of the Dragon since it is highly recommended by a colleague. I ordered the pot stickers to start and they were delicious. The Hot 'n Sour Soup was good but I have had better elsewhere. I had the Pepper Chicken for my entr√©e and it was delicious. It is pricey but the portion size is good. I was very disappointed to find how expensive the house hot sake was but as a previous review said, \"that's Vegas for you.\" I will definitely be back to Garden of the Dragon and if you find yourself nearby you should check it out as well!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this restaurant on 9/10/2011 for dinner.  Overall, we were quite impressed!  However, it was not a fantastic start.  For an appetizer, we ordered basically crab ragoon (they call it something different).  We were not impressed.  There was barely any filling at all.  However, for entrees, my wife had the Peking Duck and I had the General Tso's.  Both were absolutely excellent!  Plus, you got a great deal of food and definitely did not go away hungry.    The service was fantastic and incredibly fast!  The dessert we had (some type of coconut ice cream cake) was delicious as well; very light but very good.  For about 1/2 the price of Benihana, we had an excellent meal and an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Garden of the Dragon recently opened for lunch hour.  I've eaten here three times in the past month.  Appetizer - I always get the sweet & sour cucumbers.  There's just enough chili pepper in them to give it a nice kick.  The pork potstickers are excellent as well.  Kimchee is offered on the menu, but I'm not a fan....so I have no opinion of that dish.  Entree - I usually get the vegetable fried rice.  It's not the best I've ever eaten, but it's good.  Dessert - I rarely get dessert here, but on my last visit I got a Mango Sorbet.  It was served on a dish and the server brought me a spoon to eat it with....which was very difficult because the hard texture made digging into it with a spoon challenging.  In the end, I used a fork to eat it."}
{"text":"so we went into this place because the wait for Benihanas was like 2 hours, not doable when you are hungry and coming down froma buzz.   Honestly it was pretty good. we got there about 30 minutes to closing (which was fairly early), so you could kinda tell they were trying to rush a little. The food was good and are server was trying to be as polite as possible and not too pushy, which I respected. SHe was very good at making sure we got everything we needed in a timely manner.   was much better than I expected. if we go back, we will try to go earlier so we can get the full effect."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food. Totally unexpected, fresh and well prepared. Great service and ambience."}
{"text":"Good fast pleasant service, good food. Pad Thai could use less egg and more shrimp and vegi's. Not the best ever but most definitely fine for lunch. Grilled dumping appetizers was very good with a nice sauce."}
{"text":"This place is inside the Las Vegas Hilton, just next door to Benihana's. The food was okay - nothing special - except teh pot stickers. They were exceptional. Crisped so that they blistered. Loved them. Frankly, they moved the place up from 2 stars to three. It is a bit pricey - but then, Vegas is pricey."}
{"text":"We entered the Hilton's Garden of the Dragon at 5:30pm when they open for dinner. The decor is upscale they have a multi tiered dining room that feels like you are in China, a waterfall, LED fireworks show that goes off every once in a while. As for food they have all the Americanized choices and even a few traditional.   I ordered the traditional Peking Duck. After ordering the server nicely explained that the dish takes quite sometime and that an appetizer would be appropriate. I thought that was great, most places don't mind letting you wait or the servers just aren't tuned in.   So I sipped on a Hot & Sour soup while waiting for my duck. The soup was a little spicy and full of the usual suspects seaweed, tofu, msg?   When the duck landed on my table it was a huge platter. I could have easily shared this dish with my wife and considering it's 24 bucks we would have come out pretty well.   The duck was perfectly roasted and the pieces with the skin on were crispy and Delicious. The platter comes with white fluffy rolls that almost taste underdone but I guess that's a Chinese bakery thing. The Hoisin sauce was super rich dark and creamy so I used it very sparingly on the duck. The sauce most likely had some MSG but good luck finding awesome Asian sauce that doesn't.   All in all a great Chinese restaurant and reasonably priced for a Vegas casino."}
