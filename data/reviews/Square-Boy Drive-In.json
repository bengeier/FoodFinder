{"text":"This place is filled to the brim with character and will satisfy if its cheap, greasy, indulgent eats you seek.  Taking a step back from the hype though, I'd like to offer an alternative opinion. When you think about it, the food really is unhealthy and there's probably more people eating here more regularly than they should. Its cool and retro, but underneath the vintage blue-collar, immigrant atmosphere there is a sadness here."}
{"text":"I've read a lot of the reviews and laughed at the negative ones. The regular burgers taste the same as something you would get at ANY burger place in Canada or the United States, Chicago included. This is ANOTHER iconic Toronto dive/greasy spoon that was much better back in the day. Although it's still pretty damn great today. The souvlaki is great. I like the home burgers as well. Old school toppings and service. 20 years ago this was the place if you wanted to grab some great eats and meet a few ginas on Friday night. Hairspray, Drakor Noir, Curly hair, excessive makeup, gino beats blasting from Camero's, greasy burgers/fries and brio pop, those were the days."}
{"text":"This place is just OK, nothing more, nothing less! I love the fresh salads more than their sandwiches. They need to do something about the chaos inside their restaurant during the rush hours, but then, I guess, it's become part of the appeal. Their chicken souvlaki is much better than their hamburgers."}
{"text":"I'd passed this place innumerable times and wanted to try it...finally did. I really expected to have the classic greasy spoon experience. Unfortunately, I did not. Very disappointing, no matter how cheap. Won't be going back. Tasteless burger patty with condiments 'thrown on'...I think even the onions had been sitting around since the place opened and it's been around a long time."}
{"text":"It's a little pricey considering it's your basic burger joint but the burgers are a good size as are the fries.  It's kind of like going back to your high school days & the 'real' gravy on the fries is a must every visit.  My friend always scarfs down one of their chicken burgers & onion rings.  She too is a happy camper."}
{"text":"A bunch of 60 year old Greek men cooking good Greek food. There's always a line but it's worth it in terms of best bang for your buck. Chicken soulvaki is good with everything on it. It's fulling but you can always afford a second one due to reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Good value.  Chicken burger with fries and pop for $4.75 + tax.  Can't really go wrong if you have a hankering for fast food.  Chicken was from a frozen breaded patty.  Fries are also from frozen.  I didn't order the souvlaki but that did look like it was made fresh.  Friendly neighborhood feel.  Don't expect much in the way of gourmet taste but it is solid value."}
{"text":"Greasy goodness on the Danforth! Always a lineup means great food! Tiny booths always available because most do takeout..."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend are absolutely obsessed with square boy make sure to try the chicken souvlaki on a pita and the homemade banquet burger is my fav! Also the onion rings are delish the guys working there are always cracking jokes!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now and service is horrible! The old Greek man behind he counter is unbelievably rude and makes you feel uncomfortable when he makes little comments towards you.  The food is not at all that great neither. I've had way better Greek food elsewhere. I'll never be back again."}
{"text":"I've had takeout from here quite a few times and keep coming back. The chicken is moist and delicious, portions are generous and you can't beat the prices. One of my fav takeout spots on the danforth. I recommend the chicken on a bun or pita or the hamburger."}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap. What more can you possibly want?  I went to Square Boy tonight on one of my many repeat visits since I was first taken there by a friend in September '08. As always, it was yummy, affordable, and I walked away crazy full.  As others have mentioned, the burger combo (a large, fresh-cooked patty with your choice of toppings, a carton full of fries, and a can of pop) costs a mere $4.25 + tax (add a little bit more if you want cheese on it). This is not only cheaper than a chain fast-food joint, but it's also WAY more delicious! I should also note that they have a wide variety of pop can options, and I usually indulge in an old-school fave such as Grape Crush.  I've also tried the souvlaki there which is pretty standard amongst the other fast-foodish places along the Danforth. Not the best I've ever had in the area, but very good for the price.  Oh, and you've gotta love the staff. Those old Greek men and their sarcasm and bluntness always makes me laugh!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Good food at reasonable prices. Went there for over 10 years before we move. If they can charge $5 for a burger, real fries, and a coke, why can't the fast food chains. Try it, you'll like it..."}
{"text":"Square boy is awesome.  It's a greasy old diner with great cheap burgers and fries, the onion rings are fantastic!  No it's not a place for snobs, it's more like competition for McDonald's.  It wins by a long shot!    The constant lineup speaks for itself.  May they be in business forever."}
{"text":"Classic wholesome flavours. Simplicity delivered well. Can't go wrong here. Good price on beers too"}
{"text":"Their food is AMAZING every time I go in there is a line up out the door. And for good reason their gyro's are so delicious and chicken souvlaki to die for, everything is always fresh and hot. And the staff is always polite and funny and they make you feel welcome. There is a young guy there I call him blue eye's so handsome he is not there much but is always so sweet to my daughter. Great place to eat dont pass it up just because they are busy, because it is soooo worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great service; warm, familiar and professional.  They remember you after only 2-3 visits.  Always a long line-up, but it moves quick and the wait is indicative of the popularity, quality, price and yummy food to come.  The banquet burger is amazing, (don't bother with the home-made version, it's slightly extra cost isn't worth it).  The greek salad is HUGE and while it is not the typical kind, it's finely chopped lettuce, exactly 4 olives and 4 slices of tomato are just right in addition to the perfect \"Greek-Style\" dressing that is generously slathered all over the large dinner plate; it's absolutely mounded in fast-food-syle Greek yumminess.  I crave the burger and salad for months...Superb tzaziki and traditional Greek food too.  There can be a tad of a language barrier at the prep area, but they try their best to give the best. Lots of families order large take-out dinners, and the general customer profile is quite varied. You gotta love a true old-fashioned family-owned diner.  Quite cleanm too!  Best bet on the Danforth!"}
{"text":"The only thing keeping me from giving Square-Boy a 5 is that it takes a loooooong time to get your food.  Also, it is beyond me why anyone would get a burger there (not that I have ever had one), I'm sure they are fine but you can get burger anywhere.  The souvlaki is the cat's ass.  Also a note to Susan O., I have been to much worse purveyors of food in the great (and I truly mean great) city of Chicago."}
{"text":"Cheap, old-fashioned burgers that'll keep you full. Their souvlaki on a pita is a must-try if you're craving Greek food."}
{"text":"If you like souvlaki you have to try square boy. It's the best on the Danforth!! And the price can't be beat."}
{"text":"Get the Homemade burger, it's worth the upgrade and still so freaken cheap. This joint dates waaay back and is still cash only, not that you need much. They do bottles of beers for $3.50! Get the gravy: it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"How can I rate this place any less than a 5 star when the prices are so good? Sure, the burger is nothing fancy like those gourmet burger places, and resembles something you might get at a fundraiser BBQ, but for a price like that, I am not going to complain.  I got the burger, fries, and pop combo for only $5.35 incl. tax. I'm glad they had iced tea there because some places don't.  The patty is pretty thin, but it's OK because they give you lots of toppings and the bun is super soft and fresh. The fries weren't crispy or salted so make sure to get some ketchup. Also, keep in mind they don't have fancy sauces; just ketchup and mustard. Don't come here expecting gourmet burgers!  Also, do not come in here around 1:30pm expecting to find a seat. I waited, hoping that I'd miss the 12pm lunch rush, but when I came, the place was bustling and people kept coming in. It seems to be a very popular place. I would say, aim for take-out and find somewhere else to eat it, unless you're willing to stand around waiting for a seat, or share a seat with someone.  Man, I still can't get over their prices. I will definitely be stopping here again to get my quick fix burger!"}
{"text":"aaaah...the heavenly chicken soulevakis on the buns and their very own tzatziki sauce. The food is so simple but tastes so good! Don't recommend going here on a friday night as you will have to wait long. We always do take out even on week nights as the place is too crammed.  Price is great (don't think the prices have changed in years, but that's a good thing!) . Love Love Love!"}
{"text":"Good place to go for cheap, decent-tasting burgers and souvlaki. Their prices are very reasonable, but the place is really small, there is limited seating, and there are always huge lineups. I went there once and I was stuck waiting there for an hour and I was almost late. Food is not bad, but if you don't want to stand in line for awhile, I suggest going earlier (before 5:00 PM but after the lunch rush)."}
{"text":"Whadda  deal  !! Great burgers and fries and souvlaki on a pita  and I love the guys who work there too!!"}
{"text":"Square Boy offers the best grindage in the east-side, especially after a night of drinking down the street at The Only Cafe. I rarely find myself down on the Danforth unless I'm visiting the Only, and Square Boy is the perfect food solution at the end of the night. (Note, Square Boy closes before the Only does, so time your inebriation/hunger ratio accordingly).  The burgers are large as hell, the fries and drink combo is cheap, and the meal will leave you satisfied, I guarantee it. (Disclaimer: This is not a guarantee).  Bonus: The gentlemen behind the counter are damn funny and friendly. A visit to SB is never dull."}
{"text":"Staple in the greek community.Been around for over 30yrs offering the best chicken souvalki on bun...hands down. Forget a?l the other places like Mr.Greek and other establishments out there. Where in the city can you get a combo like that for $7 and change??. And it tastes great!!!!.   Looking to feed the family or yourself, this is the place to go. Try their half chicken dinner, or their burgers as well. You wont disappointed."}
{"text":"Everytime I come to this area, I have to come to square boy. I love their gyro wraps and their greek salads. The prices are amazing. I think the only thing I would recommend is expanding the place because it is always crowded but I'm not giving this place less than 5 stars because I guess that's not their fault."}
{"text":"The wait time is ridiculous. Why anyone would wait over half an hour for the worst burgers is beyond me. The patties were overcooked and had the consistency of spam. There was way too much bun."}
{"text":"love everything on there menu, i grew up on this food and trust me the best the Danforth has for the cheapest price!:)"}
{"text":"I've given Square Boy a few chances, but I just don't get what people love about this place. I would say it's average or even less than average, depending on what you order. Yet, there's always lineups. That boggles my mind because there are places on the Danforth that offer better food.  My only suggestion: stick with Greek food when you go here.  Twice, I've ordered burgers that were terrible - each time the burger patty was flat and seemed like it was thawed, the bun was stale and flaky and the burger itself really didn't have any flavour. I will never order another burger from there again.  The experience was a little better when I ordered chicken souvlaki on a bun on my third visit."}
{"text":"Cheap good fast food. Chicken souvlaki,  greek salad is excellent. They only take cash. No debit. Always a line up."}
{"text":"Just a true greasy spoon, place looks super dated and its interesting to watch them making sandwiches and stuff. That being said the homemade burgers are fantastic, souvlaki is some of the best in the city. They are super cheap and open late. Make sure you bring cash though as that is all they take. If you havent been here before you need to check it out!"}
{"text":"Nice to find a place that does it old school with old school prices. Crazy little place ! I loved the fries and gravy and chicken on a pita."}
{"text":"My Butcher on Pape (Ellas Meat Market) recommended this place a few years ago, as this was his go-to joint for fast, and affordable Souvlaki. They supply all the meat to Square Boy, so I knew I was in for a treat.  Been here several times since, and leave happy every single time. The service is pretty fast, and the men behind the counter are funny in their old school ways. Always great banter going on, with everyone poking fun at each other. It's like a dinner and show at Medieval Times, minus the horses.  Though they have many Diner favourites on the menu, I always go for the Souvlaki. Marinated with lemon juice, and oregano, the meat is tender, juicy, and flavourful. The Tzatziki adds just the right amount of creaminess and a garlicky hit. I also love the fact that they squirt a combination of Olive Oil/Lemon Juice/Garlic on top. SOOO delicious! And their Greek Fries with Feta are the bomb too!  This is a Diner, and quarters are cramped, but that's what I love about it. Cushy booths, no frills service, 60's vibe. I dig it!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place. My boyfriend and I come twice a week at least. The staff are the friendliest, most community oriented group of guys in Toronto. The food is spectacular and the price is very affordable."}
{"text":"Love the Chicken Souvlaki, it's great value for under $7 you can't go wrong with it on a bun. If you are going at lunch (12-1 pm) or dinner (5-7pm)give yourself some extra time because the lineups can be quite long especially during the summer months. They have all the items you would expect from a old school burger joint from burgers, onion rings, fries, BBQ chicken, gyros and milkshakes. The other good thing is that they have beer as well. Can't think of a better combo then a ice cold beer, grilled burger and fries.   Eat here once and you will understand why there is a big lineup. Just make sure you bring cash as they don't take credit or debt cards. If you forget cash there is a TD bank across the street though"}
{"text":"Do they get massively busy? Yes. Why? They're worth it. The wait usually isn't that long once you get in. This isn't fine dining so I don't understand half the complaints found in the other reviews. Their food is tasty, cheap, and filling. My husband and I have tried their chicken burger combo (for $5, half of what you would pay anywhere else for sandwich, fries, and drink), cheeseburger, and chicken slouvaki on pita. Everything was delicious. The chicken looked like it could have been one of those frozen chicken patties that they quick fried but for $5 I won't complain.   I highly recommend the chicken slouvaki on pita made all the way with the lemon sauce."}
{"text":"I've grown up with this place being Greek and all.  My dad used to bring me here when we lived in the area back in the early 80's.  So, let's get to it.  This place is not something you can expect a lot from.  It's an old school diner with your typical greasy spoon fare found everywhere in North America.  I've read a few reviews from people giving this place 2 stars and then giving McDonald's 4 stars which is completely unfair and illogical.  This place is family owned and the soul that goes into the food does raise the standard of it.  It's definitely not healthy nor does it have a Michelin star, but why would anyone expect that?  It's definitely not pretentious and never tried to be anything other than what you see.  So, let's go to the food.  Cheap, tasty food, nothing spectacular except the money you save and the overall value for a decent meal.  What have I had?  Chicken souvlaki on a bug (the best I've had ever, as you've probably already read), rotisserie chick (very good) and last, their home-made banquet burger.  Stick to these items and you'll not be disappointed.  Don't expect to pay more than $10 for any of what I mentioned.  Oh and that's $10 for the combo.  Disappointed?"}
{"text":"$5 Hamburger Special with fries and a pop! Can't beat that. The Souvlaki is the best!"}
{"text":"Ok, ok, ok, so I went to to the Diner after an amazing Tuesday evening spin class approximate time 7:55 PM- place is packed: line-up out the door; no worries I need a protein fix; Jamie and the crew are swamped; to the boys credit this is nothing out of the norm; functioning like an F1 Pit Crew; Jamie is not only calmly taking orders he is looking right in the eyes of the customer ensuring every fine detail and finicky nuance of your specific order is accurately parlayed down the line to the boys who are spitting out orders like no-one else's business. Due to the constant line-up wait time is approx 20 mins; the food comes - in the car out of here; I can barely contain myself couple of bites on the way home; bloody phenomenal again. Keep up the good work boys!   Richie Rich~"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Square Boy Drive In. I visit here twice a month for their chicken souvlaki on a pita for $5.65!  It's a great deal for the amount of chicken you get. NOTE: This place does get really busy, with takeout orders and walk-ins so expect to wait up to 15 mins for your order.  Seating is limited, so I recommend taking it to-go. There is ample free parking in the back!  Old school greek diner serving up cheap, freshly made food!"}
{"text":"Just pass the expensive Greek restaurants on the Danforth. You'll always see the same older men running the place. This place is crazy busy but always consistent.  My wife and I have been here many times, you have to get the chicken souvlaki dinner or combo. Everything is really cheap you can grab gravy and drinks and your meal will be less than $10.   Food - huge portions, greasy but not too much grease. Simple but delicious.  Rating - gotta give it a five because never been disappointed when coming here. Forgot to mention the free parking lot and 50 cents for gravy! Yeah crazy. It's open late too."}
{"text":"I rather go here for a burger, rather than McDonalds.  Good to go when it's busy.  Busy means fresh and hot.  Prices are great.  Ambiance:  3/5. Old school greasy spoon but clean. DO: chicken souvlaki - charred nicely (4/5) with extra tzatziki - nice and garlicky (5/5) - I usually ask them to cut the kebabs in smaller pieces; regular burger DON'T:  home-made burger (salty and mushy), gravy (salty)"}
{"text":"square boys has gone down hill, last week i ordered a chicken souvlaki on a bun with fries special (side gravy) $8.14.  When i got home it was on a pita that's ok with me, but pita was stale, fries where under cooked and tasted like fish and the gravy a salty mess.  i know it's fast food but the quality is not there anymore.  it's really just garbage food.  i guess i've got older and not drunk enough to like it anymore."}
{"text":"It is what it is.    Consistent.   Cheap.   Tasty.     Reminds me a bit of the Greek restaurant skit from the really old SNL with John Belushi and Dan Akroyd.   Coke??? No coke!    Pepsi..."}
{"text":"Hilarious place! Been around for a long time and you can tell. But if you can get past the rough looking crowd and a bit of a wait you will be very happy with this place. Simple Greek and greasy spoon type food but large portions of good food for sooooo cheap! Chicken souvlaki dinner with fries and salad is under 10$ and is great! Highly reccommend for lunch or take out."}
{"text":"Service was really good, even though it was super busy, they took their time with the old folks, which I really appreciated. The atmosphere is decent, the portion sizes big for a fair price, but I can't exactly say I loved the chicken souvlaki as much as everyone else did...however, their tzatziki is delicious.  Good food, good price, excellent portion sizes. Definitely worth it to check out!"}
{"text":"SUCH A CLASSIC. Chicken on a pita with fries is the best thing ever. Prices are so low and the quality is amazing. Pro tip order fries and then put them in the chicken on pita. It tastes so good!! Line ups are long but service is quick and wait times never exceed 15 minutes. Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for classic delicious Greek food for very very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Have been a regular at Square Boy for years, just like most of the East Enders here, usually getting the chicken souvlaki on a pita. Souvlaki is succulent and not greasy - the seasoning is to die for (making the souvlaki tastier than at all the Greek restaurants on the Danforth), especially when combined with their in-house tzatziki and lemon sauces. For under $5, it is very filling and perfect for late night cravings that don't make you feel bad about yourself. Make sure to get extra tzatziki! Their milkshakes are really tasty as well. I have often joked that if I were rich and famous and wanted food flown in, Square Boy chicken souvlaki would definitively be a regular feature.  The decor is old school diner but tightly packed - better for a quick bite than hanging out with friends for a long time. There always seems to be a line no matter what time of day, but the wait for me has never been too bad. Free parking is probably a great perk for some, but I usually crave Square Boy later at night when it is free on the Danforth anyways. Location is close to Donlands for those taking the TTC. Though it is a quite no frills place, one thing that prevents me from coming more often is lack of debit/credit card payment options."}
{"text":"Old Greek man behind counter hurt customer feelings when customer trying to order food. He do this to all customer.  Old Greek man know that customer eat more food when customer not feel good about self.  Old Greek man very good business man. But FatCat get Stockholm syndrome from going to square boy.  FatCat now go to square boy looking forward to abusive customer service. FatCat confused.!?!?.  Things FatCat like  - Food (recommend Gyros on a bun with fries)  - Prices - FatCat think Old Greek man forget to change menu prices since 1985. Shhh. Not say anything. Prices go up if customer remind Old Greek man that now 2014.  - Cash only. FatCat not like use credit card or debit card.  Cash-only make FatCat realize he spending real money and not just funny money.  Also FatCat not like NSA to find out what kind of food FatCat like. If NSA want information about FatCat... FatCat  provide NSA with sample from FatCat's kitty litter box - NSA can analyze sample to find out what kind of food FatCat eat...  Not analyze FatCat credit card info please Mr. NSA... Thank you...  Things FatCat not like  - FatCat not like to be around too much police. But police love square boy as much as FatCat and always come to get souvlaki. Not big problem for FatCat. FatCat just hide in far booth until police leave. Then FatCat stretch paws and enjoy Gyros and fries with bottle of Carlsberg.  FatCat recommend square boy as part of \"danforth tri-fecta of bliss\". This is when customer go to three places close by in one nite.  FatCat explain more in another post.   UPDATE: pls see FatCat review for \" The Only  cafe\" for trifecta of bliss."}
{"text":"Such a great fast food joint for souvlaki. Excellent price for a big chicken souvlaki on a bun. They slather the tzatziki like it's butter & finish it off with Square Boy's sub sauce. So fracking juicy & good. Don't care what others think, I'm a fan. And the ornery farts behind the counter are entertaining to watch, like having a meal & a show."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken souvlaki on a bun and it was phenomenal! My only complaint would be that the chicken was a little overcooked, but other than that it was great. The prices were amazingly inexpensive and the portion sizes were also huge for the price. I didn't even need to order fries because the souvlaki filled me up. This is definitely a place I would recommend!"}
{"text":"I love the old fashion style look but i wish they made it more modern and bigger as is a very popular joint and most of the times is packed.   The food is amazing and it can be addictive sometimes, especially the chicken slouvaki on a bun!"}
{"text":"A nostalgic diner feel right in the heart of Greek town! Square Boy looks like it's been transported right from the 60's into modern day Toronto. They serve a combination of classic diner options with a mix of the ever present Greek fare of the Danforth. Want a souvlaki skewer on your hot dog bun? No problem.  The place is tiny and always packed but if you're willing to wait 10 - 15 mins, it's totally worth it. Their burgers are homemade and actually taste like a burger. Tot top it off, you can have a meal for two for under $10!"}
{"text":"Busy, reliable and popular with the locals. Very cheap fast food made from appropriately cheap ingredients. It's passable, but certainly isn't doing wonders for the community's vital signs."}
{"text":"Affordable... for a reason.  The fact is I've had better food for the same price and I didn't have to put up with grumpy old a-holes shouting indiscernable English commands and questions!  Customer service is not really their thing.  Seems like they're under the impression fast is all that matters, but when I go to a greasy spoon,  I don't need service to be uber quick, as much as I prefer a friendly demeanour.  Bottom line, don't go out of your way to go here... Not worth a trip.  If you're in the hood I'll admit it's a throwback... a greasy guilty pleasure at best, and a hearty meal for the price."}
{"text":"We got what we paid for. I really, really like this place. First time here, I was looking for cheap good eats and found them. Where else in T.O. Right now can you get diner food at this cost? Virtually nowhere. I've been to comparable places (I.e. Jumbo Burger) and paid more than $20 for two burgers and fries granted you'll get real potatoes, not frozen at Jumbo. However, I got two fries, one onion rings, one homemade burger, one homemade double burger (that's 100% beef btw, their regular burgers are cheaper than the $4.00 100% beef ones.... Wowza!) one pork souvlaki on a pita, which was a bit dry but they don't skimp on tzatziki sauce, and one large Greek salad all for $31.00 and change. Oh, and he gave me the gravy, I'd later asked for on the side and was ready to pay for, for free. Amazing, I say. Try it out!! For fast food, it's a well oiled machine, no pun intended ;). But they're VERY efficient behind the counter. I had like 7 people in front of me and I did wait long at all. Oh, it's a little cramped inside but I was not eating in, there are some seating booths however and a cool Ms. Pacman arcade game. Customer services is what you'd expect at a place like this, the guy with the crystal blue eyes at cash is pretty nice :)"}
{"text":"Grew up in the area place wasn't bad in the 90's Prices always stayed fair but i noticed the quality of the food has gone downhill. Also the last time i went here the staff was very lazy.  Hard to believe this place still has lots of customers. There is much better places."}
{"text":"Although the place is not much to look at, some of their dishes are incredibly tasty (as evidenced by the frequently long line out the door!). The chicken souvlaki on a bun/pita is some of the best souvlaki I've had in all of Greektown. No lie!!! The chicken is big and juicy, and their tzatziki sauce is super thick and flavorful. I have also heard that their home made hamburgers are good, though I still have yet to try. I think the secret ingredient might be Greek man sweat. Seriously, that chicken is fantastic.   Note - they only take cash."}
{"text":"Love coming to Square boy on the danny for some casual eats! I always get the chicken souvlaki with salad and fries or onion rings (usually to go)!! Their service is great.  Their tasiki sauce is unmatched"}
{"text":"Cheap food. Love everything on their menu!! Im in love with their gravy. Put that sh*t on everything. Call ahead or avoid dinner and lunch rush or there will be a LONG wait for your food!"}
{"text":"Sometimes it's not just about the food.  The points in James K's review really sums up a lot of the Square Boy experience for me and I'll add these points as well:  - Black Label in the bottle - They remember your face - They want your business - They always have the same lame jokes - Chicken souvlaki on a bun fully-loaded. - Good for pre or post Only Cafe pints  In my experience, that of my friends and from what I've read here, stay away from the burger and stick with the souvlaki and enjoy the Square Boy experience."}
{"text":"This place is great for a hangover, cheap as hell and tastes like the generic average burger and fries of my childhood.  Is it great? God no.  But if you ever have a craving for cheap nostalgia, then go here."}
{"text":"Colleague went in for a dinner.. I grabbed some fries. He said his burger was really good.. big and juicy. I would go back again.. I hadn't been there in years."}
{"text":"Great for quick, cheap, greasy, and delicious take-out - love their chicken souvlaki and fries. Perpetually busy, for good reason."}
{"text":"It's a neighborhood fast food joint that's supposed to have good gyros and  chicken shwarmas that my friend who lives in the area recommended.   First, I ordered a gyros on a pita with a side salad. Instead of charging me $8 for the dinner plate, he charges me another $4.25 for the salad on top of the $4.25 for the sandwich he rings in separately.   The salad was a mound of shredded iceberg lettuce, a couple slices of tomatoes and olives drowning in a pound of syrupy Italian dressing. The gryos was as chewy as shoe leather - tough like it was old or fried too long (yes, I saw them fry it and not shave it off the core).  Maybe I should've ordered the burger or chicken shwarma like most of the peeps seemed to, but my food was bad and the service shady. There's no way a place like this could serve this crap and stay in business in Chicago or even a more central neighborhood in Toronto, for that matter."}
{"text":"For a place that heats up frozen food it really does suck.  Watered down condiments and square attitudes. Even the cheese on a cheeseburger. Was cold. No thanks."}
{"text":"Square boy has ruined me for other souvlaki joints. I swear it's the best in the city. Moist, tender, lemony, garlicky and served with equally awesome tzatziki. The staff are old-timers who take their job seriously- the place runs smoothly and efficently. Still, on a weekend night the line up could be out the door. You can call ahead for take out. Also, its cash only. If you haven't been, go."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years, shocked that nobody has mentioned how good the gravy is, fried and gravy are a must whenever I am there. Place is full of character with the above mentioned Greek guys always providing entertainment, and it is true that once you have been a time or two, they remember you as soon as you walk in. As mentioned here, the guys can't make a salad to save their lives, but they are very good with any meat. My usual order is either gyros on a pita (never fried like mentioned in another review) or a chicken souvlaki on a pita with fries and gravy. Makes for a great dinner.  My only criticism of this place is that they recently renovated and put in new seating booths, they are too tight a fit for me, plus they are too high, we used to come with a group and everyone could chat, can't anymore with the new high booths.   I will be back for sure, and hope you will too"}
{"text":"Get Interact or Visa! This isnt 1990, people just dont carry cash on them all the time, do u know how cheap it is to have a machine installed? This restuarant looses so many customers because of it. Thats why it gets a 1 star rating."}
{"text":"My cousin and I came here around 9pm and it was pretty busy so I thought it should be good. We go in and it's our turn and the cashier is no were to be found. We wait about 5 minutes and we see the cashier come out cleaning his hand with napkin and take a sip of his drink. He left us to go eat. Not sure why he didn't ask someone else to cover till he eats. My cousin is from UK and he tries to order first. He asked for a check wrap and then the cashier said something in Spanish and so unclear that we both asked what and what he did is one of the main reasons from the 1 star. When we asked what he said he rolled his eyes and said pita bread or a roll. The whole time he didn't even smile. I then order my cheeseburger and we sit down. I look at the next person ordering and see the dude laughing and smiling because a regular has returned. Not sure why this place is busy first because the food is just ok and nothing special and second  if you don't treat new customers the right way you should go out of business.  Don't roll your eyes Mr cashier (the guy with mustache)"}
{"text":"Had a burger it was good till it gave me the shitsssss ... Will have to try it again.... Maybe ..... But it's always busy"}
{"text":"Hungry? If you're in Greek Town / Danforth area you gotta check out square boy! Quite possibly the best Greek food! Their portions are Ginormous and price is more then reasonable! Hence that's why there's always a line up! The ambiance in this fast food joint is \"old school\"! The decor inside is definitely dated such as the counter tops, signage and the display menu. (Colour from the Photo of the dishes are faded). Their uniforms are all in red with paper hats and aprons reflecting the 70's and 80's. They even have a Pac-Man arcade game machine inside! No face lift needed! The food and the price speaks for itself!!! Their Chicken souvlaki on a pita with their secret lemon / olive sauce is a hit! I'm salivating while writing this review :P Check this place out! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Square boy is the perfect fast food place that doesn't make me feel like I'm eating fast food. The little diner is a great place to pick up one of their handmade banquet burgers or Greek dinners. My husband is a fan of their gyros dinner and I always go for the burger and fries combo.   The place is small but any restaurant with an old school Pac-man game wins points with me. This is defiantly not the place to bring a stroller unless its patio season and you can sit outside - there is simply no room inside the restaurant. But there is a pretty big patio when its not packed. Also it's true there is also a wait for food, but its cooked fresh on an experienced cook-line and you can be happy to know that its not just being spit out of the kitchen.   Make sure you bring cash as they don't accept any kind of plastic - and make sure you NEVER ask for a Coke because the guy behind the cash won't be very pleased with you. He's obviously a Pepsi lover."}
{"text":"this is not about the cheap eats but the old, mustached, grey haired creep most frequently behind the cash. he unfortunately seems to be unable to stop flirting with women who frequent the restaurant. my mrs called him on it and he said he would stop but still he continues. not in the charming you look lovely today way but in the leering, with obvious lecherousness way all the creepier given he is an older man well past his best by date. she believes he is also the one who left a note on her windshield complimenting her backside. he knows she is married and he knows she has young children. that kind of harrassment is not welcome and we will never go back."}
{"text":"Great food. Large portions, cooked to order and very reasonably priced. Only down fall is its cash only."}
{"text":"Old school burger shop. SUPER cheap and tasty. Patio is great for people watching and free parking!"}
{"text":"Cozy and greasy. A no-nonesense chicken souvlaki shows off simple quality, while solid fries and very affordable prices would make this a standard lunch stop even when you compare it to other dives on the Danforth. My only complaint is that it is cash-only."}
{"text":"Gyros on a pita is my favourite.  Hamburgers are not so great. The staff can be standoffish because they have customers coming out of the ying yang and don't have to be particularly nice. Wish they were friendlier to the non-Greek speaking customers but then again, I guess I don't have to go there.  The food does bring me back despite the less than friendly staff."}
{"text":"Went here last night . Very busy place and small restaurant. The service was standard. All men staff. You stand in line here. No table service. They were however nice.I was able to get a seat ; people eat fairly quickly. I had the chicken souvlaki dinner.i came with chicken off the stick mouthwatering salad and fries. I added mouthwatering brown gravy. There was no rice or roasted potato option. The food did not disappoint. It was juicy and I felt no need for drink( water) till after my meal. That's up to you though. I was starving. So this meant a lot for me. I just wanted to eat. Lol.They also serve alcohol. I observed a table of gentlemen just drinking wine and beer. The prices are extremely reasonable for a restaurant; no exorbitant charges. Extra sauces are only 50cents including  brown gravy and tatziki sauce( I however not found of the tatziki sauce) they do put one helping on the side for this meal. I thought it tasted spoil. The food handler let me know it was sour because of the way it's prepared. Completely normal; however not for my tastebuds. They do however have a lemon zest sauce for the chicken that is even tastier. So no real problems there. They do have a small parking lot . I suggest reverse park ( if you can) I was in a hurry so I did not . Luckily a friendly customer helped me out the lot. I also have a big car. However it was a plus not paying for street parking. Will definitely be back in the future. Yummy. Good place. Real laid back atmospheric. You don't have to be fancy. Happy eating"}
{"text":"Been coming here every once in awhile since highschool. Place isn't too big and tends to be really packed during lunch hours since there's a school nearby and when dinner comes there's usually no seats. Food is great, I usually go with the chicken souvlaki special or the half chicken special. They take cash only! no credit/debit so make sure you stop at the bank or atm beforehand"}
{"text":"Best place for greasy, diner type food! I've come here over and over for my souvlaki fix. The portions are great, good quality (for diner standards), environment was clean, service is quick, polite and genuine. Prices are reasonable. I've never had a burger here, but I hear they're good too. This is a landmark on the Danforth, been around for ages. Really raw and genuine diner experience :)"}
{"text":"Not the best greek food on the Danforth but Square boy is the best bang for your buck. When we ate here it was a Sunday and the line was out he door. So expect a little wait but the line does move fast.     We had the chicken souvlaki dinner and the chicken souvlaki gyro. Both tasted great and filled us up."}
{"text":"this place brings back memories of when i was a tiny little boy growing up on the Danforth and after church we would come here.  Well 20 years later and now i have moved back and live here!   I don't go out of my comfort zone here and only order the chicken on  bun with fries.  DAMMMMNNNN is it ever good.  A nice garlic loaf smothered in tzatziki and topped with onions and tomatoes.  They remove the large chicken souvlaki and top that off with their homemade lemon sauce which to me looks like olive oil mixed with lemon but hey that is their recipe not mine.  Since moving back to this area i have been back almost every week and will continue that as long as they have chicken on a bun!  only problem i have here is the long wait sometimes but meh life isn't always easy hahaha"}
{"text":"If not for the fact that you've seen the sign a million times this place wouldn't even be on your radar but in Toronto just staying in business more than a few years make you some kind of landmark.  The food burgers, Gyros and fries so really hard to do wrong but i don't think its something I will crave in the future.  If you are nearby and have already parked by all means go in but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this place."}
{"text":"Square Boy's retro frontage is an unavoidable classic sight along the Danforth. The grimy tacky, and cramped interior looked like it has never seen a renovation since the last Trudeau government. Clogging the path to the counter while also cementing the burger joint's retro quality, is an old Pac-Man arcade machine, beat up but looks to still be functional.  The $3 burgers is a jaw-dropping bargain in the universe of Toronto burgers, but it will fail to satisfy if you're looking for a mouthwatering stomach-stuffing burger. As a consolation, it is a much better meal than a McDonald's, and given a choice between eating here and at a multinational corporate fast food chain, I'd choose Square Boy.  The burgers are small and bare-bones plain, and its thin patty are as tasteless as a store-bought or cheap frozen pablum burger you can buy at a discount grocery--it practically is that calibre of stuff. It is hard to complain about the quality for the price paid, sure, but c'mon! How hard can it be to make your own patties versus throwing in prefab stuff that simply goes from freezer to grill? I expect that kind of pathetic shit from a fast food brand!  There are some on-site parking, and a patio space out front. The place is staffed by a crew of Greek old-timers who are shipshape but lack much customer service skills.  Apparently their Greek fares are much better than their no-frills burgers and fries. Maybe that's what I should go for the next time I ever find myself having to choose between a shitty ubiquitous fast food chain and Square Boy. Or one could cross the street to The Works, where one can indulge in pricey burgers after deciphering their overly complicated menu.  For the record, the burger patties at Square Boy are not square.  {TTC: walk your square ass from Donlands station, or get off the 83 bus when it reaches Danforth/Jones. Wait a minute, why the hell am I giving public transit instructions to a greasy hole?}"}
{"text":"The food is Decent. Burgers in this city have come a long way...  The place is painful at busy periods (often), lines, no seating, packed."}
{"text":"One of my favourite neighbourhood places, and knock on wood it stays in the neighbourhood for a long time yet.  The price point can't be beat, the family-run dynamic of the business is beyond endearing (in its own way ;)), and the food's consistently decent.  Important notes are that it's cash-only and there are often lines going out the door during peak hours, as the place is quite tight and not really built for pick up-and-go orders (though they do do plenty of them!). It's fine though. Square-Boy's worth it!"}
{"text":"The regular burg is definitely a M&M quality frozen burger. You can see them defrosting on the counter. The more expensive hand made burger is pretty decent and appears to be hand made from ground beef. Everything is flame broiled and basically you're getting a burger you could do up in your backyard. But if you don't have a backyard and live in an apartment/condo that forbids bbqs on your balcony, if you're craving the taste of a backyard burger, Square Boy is your cost effective bet.  The fries are nothing to write home about, I guess. But you can get some taziki sauce on your burger. You can't get that at Harvey's. Prices aren't bad. You get your Harvey's experience for about a $1.50 less. Plus you get some Greek guy chat straight out of SNL's Billy Goat Tavern. They might have Coke, however.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH_b9XwloHE  Seating is limited. I'm finding the Donlands a very interesting mix of aged bar fly types and \"the danforth\" hipsters migrating east. Square Boy's patrons seem to represent this confluence. Table over some guy was rocking back and forth with the DTs. At the cash was a guy rocking his Anton Apolo Ohno soul patch for all its worth. The sit down Galaga coin op almost brought tears to my eyes.  Verdict: Harvey's for those who can't afford Harvey's. Go up market and get the home made burger and feel like you have some real meat in your mouth."}
{"text":"My go-to spot for Gyros and Souvlaki in the Danforth!! Messini's is okay, but flavour wise, Square Boy does it right! Their Chicken is juicy, tender and made to perfection! The guys behind the counter are always friendly with a smile on their face! It can get quite busy and with limited seating, the lines can be long sometimes especially during dinner time."}
{"text":"A friend took me here the first time we've been here on two different occasions within a couple of weeks of each other. The man who takes the orders gets the line moving effective and also slowly repeats each order to the customer to make sure that it is correct, and it's all done at a good pace. The prices for the burgers, pita wraps and side order are affordable and the food is filling. There are also a few good combo specials that don't burn up your wallet. The first time I had a chicken sandwich in a pita with fries combo. The sandwich tasted good and also the fries had that crispy texture I usually like. The second time I had the burger combo which comes with fries and a pop, and as someones who digs onions, I got a order of that. The burger had a no-fuss taste, which hit home, the fries was just as crispy and the onion rings was delicious, thing rings that were crunchy/crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  The size of the portions looks a bit deceiving but food really fills a person up.  Both times we were there, we've had not had to wait in-line for too long and it gets moving fast enough. And I've seen several customers come in and leave with bags stacked full of burger and sandwich meals! Go check it out when you're around the Donland's station area!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the chicken souvlaki on a bun. Here's why this sandwich rules:  -Chicken cooked perfectly...nice sear, juicy, great flavour -Exceptional tzatziki -Soft bun -Fresh toppings  This sandwich doesn't just hit the spot, it punches the spot square in the face. (Tip: tastes even better when you're drunk)"}
{"text":"I love Square Boy on the Danforth.   The food is tasty and totally reasonable. I had the gyros dinner which they make nice and crunchy, and their greek salad is great. I think it was about $12 including a Carlsberg.   There is almost always a lineup but it moves quickly.   We don't often get to go to this neighbourhood but when we do we almost always plan a stop at Square Boy ."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, bad service.  I know this place is an Danforth institution, but being open for 30 years obviously doesn't exactly translate to a good custom er experience.  The food was ... Ok. I was expecting to be blown away but the burgers are just burgers like at all the other burgers joints on the same street, same with the chicken souvlaki.  Not good or bad just.... Meh. And expensive for that amount/quality of food. Think five guys prices for a Harveys hamburger.  The service is... Unique. I guess the owner works the front counter, though he doesn't seem to happy about it. The experience kind of reminded me of the soup nazi episode of Seinfeld if you know what I mean haha.  Not a bad experience but I don't understand the hype, I probably won't be back"}
{"text":"The food was good I had fish and chips.  Then I had burger and fries was good to.  The price was good next to little knot to much.  I would again and try it again."}
{"text":"Square Boy is a treasure on several levels. Is it the fanciest Greek/burger place around? No, not a chance in hell! However, it serves up great food early into the morning and with little fuss. Prices are amazing and the fact that walking through the doors is like stepping into 1985 is another solid perk (they even have the video arcade games). Great for a pre-movie bight or a post-game fix! (You can't go wrong with the pork on a bun but make sure to ask for extra tzatziki)."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this late night Greek diner, all the food on the menu is excellent and very reasonbly priced, I have however had quite a few times where I felt I had to watch over my shoulder for the suspicious characters frequenting the place. I always get my food to go here."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this spot in ages as I moved out of the neighbourhood, ended up here last night for some late night eats and it is still a killer spot. Great for a late night grub grab.   If you're craving a burger, don't bother with the regular one, it's a frozen patty (which they will tell you right off the bat and steer you towards the other option) and really not that great. Spend the extra buck or so on their homemade burger.   But what you should really be looking at is their Greek fare. I got a gyros on a pita and it was JAM PACKED with meat. Only 4 bucks and change. Tried a bite of souvlaki and was tempted to go order one of my one. Gigantic, tasty greek salad.   Onion rings were meh, I don't expect them to handbread them or anything but they weren't that good even on the frozen rings scale. Wimpy's still probably has the best (frozen) rings, in my opinion.   Much like my beloved T-Bone's, ambience/interior matches what you see on the outside. Grungy, old school. Comfy booths but not many of them. Decent patio on the outside.   I see some reviews saying the dudes behind the counter are surly or rude, I experienced the complete opposite. Cool bunch of Greek old-timers that were more than friendly...maybe we caught them on a good night.   Decent sized parking lot which is very much a welcome bonus in this part of town, though it's just outside of where the Danforth gets really busy.   Cash only which is a bit of a...PITA ah hue hue hue"}
{"text":"It's exactly what you're expecting. The banquet burger combo is cheap and filling. At 1/2 the price (if not less) than a 'gourmet' burger it's also 1/2 as good. But, that's still pretty good. It's on par with McDonalds price-wise, but you'll feel better about yourself eating here for these reasons: - Authentic atmosphere - Local businesses are being devoured by places like McDonalds - Beer - No gut-rot aftermath - Onion rings - Ms. Pac-man tabletop video game - Tzatziki - Rad old dudes - They're also funny - It's always got a line  I could eat a burger everyday."}
{"text":"Luv their gyros and chicken dinner and their price are cheap your tummy will be full in less than $10 bucks..."}
{"text":"This place always have a long line up!  With the quality and quantity of food they give, I definitely know why.    I always get their chicken souvlaki on a bun/pita $4.75.  I  actually prefer it on a bun.  The souvlaki that is in the bun is huge!! It also tastes really good with tzatziki sauce over it.  If you want to get fries with it, it's a total of $6.70.   The fries tasted alright.  Additionally $0.50 more for gravy which I usually get.   My friend got the hamburger combo for $4.75 and said it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Ive been going here since I was in highschool, which was 15 years ago. Their $5 burger, fries, and pop drink still reigns supreme in todays economy. I have yet to find a better deal than this in the area, or GTA! I always treat myself to a souvlaki dinner every now and then, its well worth the price.  The guys who have been working here have literally always worked here. The old guys in the front down to the younger fellow who mans the cash more often than not and seemingly can never lose his patience and honors every request customers throw at him. Always courteous beyond belief, of course the old guys have that old greek charm, rough exterior but always out of love.   Best place and will support them for years to come. I remember when I was a student and often didn't have enough sometimes and they always let me go. Even recently I didn't have .50 cents for my chicken souvlaki dinner and in fine form he said no dont worry next time. Now that I'm older and no longer a student I walked right across to the bank and took it out and gave it to him. He was angry that I had gone, but it wasn't to insult him. They helped me out so much when I was going to Danforth Tech, now that I'm older I can repay them. Amazing people, they are the last of a dying breed of true, neighborhood businesses."}
{"text":"Love Square Boy - always affordable - the rotisserie chicken is the best! Love the homeburgers!  Even love the grouchy chefs."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why people like this place so much.  FOOD The food taste horrible. I get dragged here by my one friend b/c she loves this place (I think it's just b/c it's cheap) but I would honestly not come here on by choice.  The food is either tasteless or just stale.  PRICE cheap  VENUE Not only is the food greasy, I feel greasy just walking into this place and sitting down."}
{"text":"Pros   Value  Price quality  selections opens late   cons  long lineup too crowded cash only"}
{"text":"I love this place not only for the food, but for the amazing kindness of the owners and staff.   I once called them while driving home late at night just to see if they were still open. It was 1am. They said \"we're closed but we can cook up a burger. Come to the side door\"  Truly remarkable customer service in this day and age.   I've also seen them extend their kindness to people who are struggling. They once offered a young man a full meal after he asked what he could get for $5.  I was moved to tears watching the whole interaction.   These are wonderful people."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Good solid food at extremely reasonable price.  The burgers are great and you can get a burger combo which comes with a drink and fries for a little over $5.00.  The place is clean and always packed at dinner time."}
{"text":"Used to pass this place before when I lived in the area. The sign is really cool, guess that's what caught my eye. Made a plan to check out the place the other day. Just don't don't go during rush hour the roads are horrendous, nothing new lol.   Place has mini parking lot which was a big plus, especially for that area. Cash only :-( ... but on the bright side you can find the big banks nearby walking distance. Went around 6pm, place was pretty busy. Had to wait in line to order and to get the food, would say around 10 minutes wasn't an issue. Indoor and outdoor seating is available which is nice. Open kitchen, you get to see the full action. Place has a nice retro vibe.    Ordered chicken souvlaki plate and tzatziki on the side, can't have too much tzatziki. Got a skewer of plump chicken, some fries, and a fresh garden salad with a nice dressing on top. As usual got some hot sauce on top as well.   The food ..... is good. Well cooked seasoned chicken and as mentioned was nice and plump. Fries your regular fries, nice and crispy. Nice salad, good amount of feta, but the dressing is what tops it. Tzatziki was worth the extra 50 cents. Overall it was a well portioned good meal.   In conclusion would I make a dedicated drive to Square-Boy Drive In...no. The food is great don't me wrong but nothing spectacular. Just your regular old fashioned, home style, hearty, whole sum, good diner food. If your in the area or if its on route then its definitely worth a try. Its okay. its good, its three stars for me."}
{"text":"The chicken souvlaki on a bun at Square Boy is the best deal on the Danforth. I prefer it on the bun over the pita. The buns have always been soft and fresh. The helping of chicken souvlaki is a good size and has never been dry. Also they put tzatziki and a lemon sauce on it, so it is definitely not a dry sandwich.  You don't have to wait to taste the Danforth for 5 dollars during the crowds of taste the Danforth. Just get yourself a chicken souvlaki on a bun for 5 bucks anyday at square boy."}
{"text":"Came here years ago and it was just a place full of drunks drinking cheap beer on a sunday. Wasn't impressed then and not impressed with it now.  I decided to check it out since a friend had told me they had new owners a while back. Nothings changed, maybe less drunks but still a gungy dive. I ordered their homeburger. Face it they should just call it a breadcrumb burger because i didn't taste much meat to it. Face it if i call something a homeburger it better be something that represents what i'm proud of serving. I bet the employees bring their lunch to work. Looks like you might have better luvk with their chicken souvlaki but face it i won't be back.  I can see why the chain disappeared in the 70s and never saw much of the 80s. This is the only one left. No square patty like they had, just an old sign to a tired old style that should go out with the past it came in."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were starving after the commute into Toronto, so we stopped for some cheeseburgers.   Unfortunately it was so busy that after 10 mins we were still not served and after a large crowd gathered post-order waiting for food, we just decided to leave.   Next time Square Boy."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Square Boy.  I had a burger there last week and it was good.  I wanted to try the chicken souvlaki on a pita and that's what I had today.   I got it with tomatoes and an oily lemon sauce and it was good and messy.  The chicken was tender (they are freshly grilled) and had a nice spice.  I'm glad I went back for it."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have been coming to Square-Boy for years and I just noticed that I haven't put my review in.   This place is great. They are very consistent with their food quality. I have had almost everything on the menu. My favourites would be the Homemade Burger, Chicken Souvlaki on a bun or pita, Gyros on a bun or pita. The fries are awesome along with the onion rings! Don't forget your gravy for the fries it's top notch.   The quality of the food great. Everything is cooked to perfection and it's made the same no matter when you come.   Be aware the line ups can be long. For lunch I recommend coming by 11:30am if you want a seat. Dinners are a mad rush as well. I don't mind waiting for Square-Boy as it always hits the spot.   I'm sure no matter what you try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Finally went to Square Boy for a take out dinner after many had recommended it. Had a Homemade burger  - It was Awesome!!!!! If you like burgers - head to Square Boy!!!!And it was $4 not $15!! And the onions rings and fries were excellent! We didn't have the souvlaki but it sure looked good too. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes nothing beats old school fast food. For the price it doesnt get better than this. Most try. Why only 3 stars becuase I'm a food snob and I have a hard time putting 4 star for frozen food."}
{"text":"Excellent homemade burgers, excellent shakes, excellent prices.  This is a great neighbourhood greasy spoon with some classic characters behind the counter."}
{"text":"Yummy half chicken dinner with fries and salad! The homemade salad dressing is amazing...wish I knew how to make it!! A really good place for burgers, euros and dinner plates!"}
{"text":"VIBE  The look from 1985 has been updated slightly to 1988. The prices are also still stuck in the 80s. This place is compact. For instance, one customer can enter the door at a time. You're greeted by a pacman machine while in line. It's all kinds of awesome. The cooks are old Greek guys and speak Greek to each other. It's very Danforth. And the cashier knows his prices inside out.  And the clientele? Men. Teenage boys, cops, construction workers, fathers and sons. They're all here.  There are women too, but mainly men.   I EAT/ATE  I come here once in a while. I opted for the cheeseburger on this visit. It's not too far off from the frozen burger variety you get at your grocery store. But at $3 I'm not going to complain. Plus, they give you extra pickles. Bonus points.  I got a side of fries and gravy and a 7 Up. Salty is an understatement for the gravy, but it's thick and slathered all over the fries in a cardboard box. Classic greasy meal and hits the spot for a craving on a Friday when you're feeling lazy.  Total combo cost: $5.65 I spent more on a chai latte and a croissant at Starbucks! RIDIC.  Their souvlaki is also a great deal at under $5 but I haven't had it for a while so I won't comment.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK It's hip to be square. Especially at these prices. If you're a burger snob, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Square boys gets 5 stars for the following reasons: CHEAP and DELICIOUS. Seriously, it is one of the least expensive places to eat on the Danforth. A combo is about 5$ or less. I usually get either chicken burger or hamburger. When they ask you for toppings just say \"everything\" it's different depending on what you've ordered.   Don't come here expecting a fancy meal or dinner date. Come here exactly for what it is, cheap fast food, tastier than the usual fast food chains."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always order the chicken souvlaki (so juicy) on a bun and a side of fries and gravy. Square Boy is a very popular place so there is always a line up. I enjoy the authentic older Greek people that work here. They are always entertaining. I always pretend I am not Greek so I can eavesdrop on their conversations. Great times!"}
{"text":"Best Chicken Souvlaki in Toronto period. This is not a burger joint."}
{"text":"A ton of cheap, shitty food.  This is an undeniably GREAT value.  But I would never want to eat it again.  The good: - There is actually a free parking lot here.  Holy Awesome! - The old Greek guys working here are made of sass. - see above re: extremely cheap and plentiful (but bad).  The bad: - The food is bad.  Specifically: (a) the burger - thin, flavourless, texture of M&M steakette patty (b) the fries - frozen, fried in lard and not oil, and disgiusting  I would probably never go here again, but for $4.80 including tax, you get a lot of food, which is probably not better than Wendy's jr. bacon cheeseburger combo."}
{"text":"Square boy offers old school the right kind of way; cash only, simple menu, cheap beer and tasty grub.   They offer great bang for the buck. Good portions of food for really reasonable prices.   This place is always busy so expect a bit of a line up. Onions rings are great, worth a try."}
{"text":"This place is always busy.  Its a greesy grill type of place.  But if you want some yummy fast greek food, this is the place to go.  Its decent pricing, the only downfall is its only cash.   Parking can be tricky but if your in the mood for greek food this is a good option."}
{"text":"Pretty good eats and nice family who seem to work there..weird crowd but good for a quick bite. They mentioned home made burgers- I'll have to try next time around.   Good quality chicken :)"}
{"text":"Good food always fresh would recommend this place to anybody. Try the chix on the bun or my favourite chix dinner."}
{"text":"Best Greek food on danforth! highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The go to place for fast and Greek food in the east end for ages. The only difference I notice lately is the fryer oil has usually been overused and gives anything fried a nasty taste. Change the oil boys a little more frequently."}
{"text":"Amazing food. A staple in the east end!! You will not  find better prices for great food. This joint is beloved by thousands of folks"}
{"text":"I've been going since I moved into the neighbourhood, and although there's lots of great things about Square Boy I find their proteins to be really dry and overcooked. I just get them to slather on tzatziki to hide it, but it shouldn't happen in the first place. But they have their ways, and the entire family works really hard.   Also, they have a tabletop of Galaga, so you can at least stay distracted during the inevitable wait. And yes, there is always a wait. Sometimes 2 minutes, sometimes 20. Also, there's cheap wine and beer if you eat there. One may be related to the other..."}
{"text":"Yum.  Love the food especially the souvlaki.  The counter staff are hilarious especially the older gentleman on the register who channels the Soup Nazi.  He's hilarious."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 big, really cheap homemade burger. For $3.75  Place: drive-in from 80s with beers  Good for after party time or quick lunch.   Will come back  :)"}
{"text":"The food is fast and fresh, you get to choose your toppings and you also get to watch your food being cooked. In the picture attached to this you can see I got a Hamburger Special which it just a hamburger with fries. The fries are very well made and fresh, and the best part is they are not smothered in salt or small and skinny, they are thick and the perfect amount of crispy on the outside. The atmosphere inside is very old diner like, it is welcoming and homly."}
