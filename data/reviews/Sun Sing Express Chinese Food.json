{"text":"I came across this place when I recently traveled to NC.

The Hole in the Wall has the BEST fried chicken wings I ever tasted.
The husband and wife owners were very friendly.  If you want fresh and fast, this is the to go place!  I wished I lived closer!"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite Chinese take-out restaurant since I was a young boy. My dad loved this place. It's a family tradition. The food is amazing. The service holds it's own as well."}
{"text":"Well, was My family's favorite Chinese restaurant until one day I went there to pick up my To-Go order and what do I see in the back, The old Chinese man blowing his nose with a paper towel then spit in a bucket that was beside of a stove or something.. I was so Disgusted by that. HE DIDN'T EVEN WASH HIS HANDS, AFTER THAT! I personally do not eat Chinese food but my husband and his family does! They been eating there for Many years! Not No more! That was very Gross, & disgusting! This is how people get sick! Not washing your hands! Why in gods earth would you have a spit bucket in the kitchen, Thank god for the Open back and you can see everything, but none the less, We won't be going back! So I'm just warning everyone keep an eye out just in case! LOST SERVICE! Food was Good though but now I'm disgusted and can't go back! #DisgustingChino #Inshock #Never Again #NoStars"}
{"text":"\"Don't go here unless you like your fried rice to taste like burnt grease. I took two bites of the rice and took it back to the front and asked for my money back. Absolutely disgusting!\""}
{"text":"Horrid food, poor service, and did I mention horrid food.  Gas station food tastes better than the dishes served here."}
{"text":"This place has the best fried chicken wings I've ever tasted.  The wings go great with the fried rice and noodles.  If you like really spicy foods, ask for them spicy!  My daughter loves their sesame chicken and orange chicken with white rice.  The sweet tea is also really good.  The owners are super nice and always greet us with a smile.  We always have a nice meal when we come to Sun Sing Express."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken wings ever! Must have with a order of sweet tea. It's hole in the wall but great tasting. I also recommend getting the eggroll or sesame chicken."}
{"text":"You either hate it or you love it. The place is not very appealing to the eye, nor is customer service a priority here, but the food and prices outweigh the places flaws, I always get fried rice and wings and it's very good, although the place could be cleaner and the atmosphere wasn't great, also the fact that they didn't accept any type of payment with credit or debit cards I semi-enjoyed my visit and plan to return here sometime."}
