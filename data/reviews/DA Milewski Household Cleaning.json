{"text":"So pleased with Mel and her crew.  Hard workers and turned our rental property into sparkling new looking!  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could leave a good review because the woman who attempted to clean my house was very sweet and kind.  However, it's been over a month since the \"cleaning\" and I'm STILL kicking myself for using this service.  My sole purpose for hiring this company was to get my showers clean because they had been neglected.  After a few hours we returned home to showers that looked the exact same!  The cleaning woman said she spent a very long time on them and just could not possibly get them clean....however I cleaned them with bleach after she left for about 15min and they came clean.  I expressed my dissatisfaction to the lady who called to collect my payment and she acted like she did not believe me.  She told me to look at the pictures on the website and said that they have experience cleaning BIG messes.  Bottom line is I paid $120 to clean my own shower and no one tried to make right of the situation."}
{"text":"In response to Matt L.'s comment below....I was one of the cleaners that busted my ass at their home. It was a tough job but they were paying for a service and the other cleaner and I wanted to do right by them.
....the cleaners for this company make $12.00/hr (+ tips) if the customer chooses to leave one. In addition D. A. Milewski does most of if not all of their house assessments over the phone. They do not go into a house before the cleaners get there and really see what needs to be done. Furthermore the cleaners while getting paid $12 an hour only get paid for 3 hours anytime after 3 hours is on their time.
In my brief time of employment there they had told us if you get to a house and it's going to take you longer than three hours let us know and we will either pay you for those extra hours or they came and looked at the house themselves and decided whether or not we would get paid for extra hours. Now with that said Mr Matt L house well it was a beautiful home did need a lot of work. With 2 cleaners myself and another, it took us six and a half hours all the while are employers calling us asking what's taking so long. We told them so they sent another cleaner after that it took us another two hours to finish their house in a proper manner. All in all because we told them how long it would take and for the fact that it took 8 hours I got paid for 3 hours I worked I believe 4 or 5 days with this company working a total of approximately 30 hours... My check was $86. Needless to say I did not go back. They make everything sound so super duper dandy on how they run payroll etc. $12 an hour sounds nice but when you're not getting paid for all your hours for assessments that they make blindly... So very unfair to their employees it is bullshit. Thank you Mr L for the generous tip you left me and my coworker when you do the math you paid me more then my employer ever did. Have a great day \m/"}
{"text":"We were stressing out because we just didn't have time to clean before our daughter's first birthday party tomorrow.  My wife and I work full time and the housecleaning has definitely been neglected since having a baby last year.  Taylor and Jolene were friendly, polite, and didn't cut any corners!  I was amazed at how hard they worked to get all of the dust off of places that hadn't seen a cleaning cloth in forever.  They didn't just rush the job and do a mediocre job to get done on time, they took the time to do it right!  The last time we used a cleaning company we were left disappointed and were leery about trying again...definitely glad we called DA Milewski.  Very much appreciated, will use again and definitely recommend.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Apparently Ms. Milewski's response to a negative review is to call the reviewer a liar. Moral of the story. Only deal with reputable businesses. In my opinion, this is not one."}
{"text":"This is an amazing company to work for. Yes,  I work for the owners who are not only amazing bosses but awesome friends. They are honest,  caring people who get out there and create jobs. I will also say we do an amazing job cleaning! 5 stars! I clean my own house,  but if I could,  I would hire this company to clean for me!"}
{"text":"Mel and her team was very good.  They came on a Saturday to do the job and not many cleaning service would do that.  But Mel and her team did and she knew how important it is to get a newly acquired home to be cleaned.   And as especially Thanksgiving is just around the corner.   And I am great for that.  Thank you Mel!!  

HAPPY THANKSGIVING!!"}
{"text":"I am 9 months pregnant and due any day now. I had them come out to clean my house before the baby came because I really do not have the energy. We have a 3 bedroom 2 bath condo. At the beginning they seemed very sweet and willing to help saying they love to help out and it's not about the money but about keeping their cleaners busy and making customers happy. Well last week they had one girl come out and she was here from 9:30am (which was suppose to be here at 9) until 3:15pm. So 6 hours. 2 of the rooms weren't even touched. There were multiple things on the list of general cleaning that they give you that were not completed. Once my boyfriend came home we really looked at everything and wondered what took 6 hours. We are not dirty people at all. After I paid so the cleaner could leave I called and messaged the owner saying how Unsatisfied I was. She said she completely understood and she herself would come back out to finish the job today (Tuesday june 28th) and finish the job herself at 1:30pm. Well 1:30 comes around and no word or no where to be seen. Then 2:00pm comes around still nothing. Sat at home and waited all day. Finally messaged her just asking for a refund because I was so unhappy with the service. She then replied saying no refunds and she tried to get ahold of me but all my messages seemed to disappear to let me know something had come up. Although she has my phone number as well as paperwork with my information on it. After trying to talk to her and resolve the issue she then blocked me so I could not message her anymore. My house is still not clean and baby is on her way any day."}
{"text":"I wish I would have read these reviews and  BBB reviews before even messaging her. I found this company through a very large Facebook group and loved how professional -she seemed. I was having them come the day before a big party at my home with family flying in. I priced over 10 companies and she was the most expensive but my husband told me you get what you pay for- pay the extra. This could not be further from the truth with this company. They arrived 30 minutes late for a deep clean, there were 4 people (3 girls and a guy), they spent TWO AND A HALF hours on my blinds which weren't even that bad. They spent another hour and a half on the rest of the house. They damaged an expensive table I got a short time earlier which I promptly took pictures of and called the owner immediately who said she would take care of it and have her insurance company call me (because they are \"licensed and bonded\"), her employees did an awful job and didn't complete one single room, I did my walk through and pointed out item after item from not moving a toaster to clean countertops, not vacuuming rugs, not wiping down windowsills, not sweeping and moping walk in closets, you name it. They repeatedly kept sighing and started whispering. At this point I felt uncomfortable in my home with four of them and when they went through again- they said they were finished and asked for payment. I paid part cash and the rest on my card (Another mistake). They left and I again phoned and messaged owner as well as called her office to explain the situation. My husband came home and asked my The housecleaners didn't come and I burst into tears and was filled with anxiety over the next 24 hours while my husband stayed up all night-literally- deep cleaning the house. She has never once phoned me back other than to message me saying that I was harassing her for trying by all means to contact her. I still have not received a call back from the so called insurance company who she refuses to give me information on, I filed a FRAUD dispute with my bank and when contacted by her bank-  I supplied them with 106 photos of their \"work\" to which they sided with me on and refunded me (what I paid with card) and to top it off- when I went in my oldest daughter's bathroom- their male employee had urinated all over the toilet and floor and left the lid up. So I was left to clean up THEIR mess. A lack in competent employees is one thing but an owner who doesn't care is an entirely different matter. The fact that they can possibly be contracted to clean any business that has to do with health is beyond frightening. Read the reviews, read her BBB reports. I even had several Facebook friends that \"liked\" her business and asked them about her and all of them said the same thing- a local group that encourages each to like each others pages- not ONE had ever used her. There is a reason so many have problems with this company- they are crap. Don't make the same mistake. 


From her own websites:

I want to bring this to everyone's attention please. If you have a complaint please within 24 hours call, text, e mail, message us so we can take care of it. Our employee's are human we do everything we are capable of and yes things do get missed but if things are not brought to our attention how will we learn and correct things?"}
{"text":"RUINED our counter top and didn't even clean the first floor. We hired them and paid 200+ dollars to have the house cleaned. They cleaned upstairs to satisfaction but literally only swept the floors downstairs. They didn't clean windows, blinds, cob webs, counters, cabinets, drawers, or mop. Not only that but we instantly noticed deep scratches on our counter top and they won't buff out. Now we need to replace our counters and they won't give us our money back. When I called she said they cleaned everything and didn't do the damage. The house is vacant so we know they did it! She then hung up on me and blocked my number. We are taking them to small claims court. Do not use this company!

Update- they are now harassing me on social media. They are accusing me of being a liar (even though I have proof they didn't clean what they said they did on the contract). They are attacking me as a person as well. They took photos of my home and posted them without permission and made rude remarks about the cleanliness of my home. They took pictures of my closet which has a brown stain on the lower part of the walls from over spray with my concrete stain and claimed it was urine. They will be served to appear in court for the damage to my counter top and the cleaning they did not complete  (eventhough their contract said they did) and other reasons. They should not be allowed to do this to anyone else."}
{"text":"I have left messages for them about the service I \"received\" and no response. They also never pick up the phone. I had a move out cleaning at my house and they didn't do a complete job. They completely missed several issues that their own \"move out\" sheet states they cover. Additionally they scrapped up my kitchen counter top and I will likely have to have it replaced. I left messages about these issues with them, but they don't seem to eager to call me back to rectify them.  Great way for a Veteran owned business to not only operate in general, but to treat another Veteran too!

Also, they were over 30mins late."}
{"text":"Updated: I'm changing my review to 3 stars because after positing this, Mel reached out to me and come back to clean what was missed. It was an acceptable job done and I now feel like I received what I paid for. 

Original post: I REALLY wish I would have read these reviews before having this company do our move out cleaning. I trusted Mel and her cleaning list. I was not there when they arrived and when she called to say they were almost done, I went to pay. Mel was not there and I was approached by three young people who handed me a slip with what I owed. I was in a hurry so I peeked in the door not wanting to walk on the clean floors. At quick glance, it looked clean. The next day, I went to the house (my family had already vacated the home) I walked around and took a much closer look. I was so very disappointed. I reached out to Mel and showed her pictures. I got one comment back from her which was, \"so did I. I had to leave at 11:15.\" I have posted my photos here on yelp and I hope that it helps others in choosing a different company. Mel, if you are reading this, I gave you a perfect opportunity to make this right and to show me what kind of company you run. I was nice when I reached out to you. I would have happily written you a stellar review that would have helped you gain more business. Instead, you have put me in the position of making sure that others don't get scammed by your checklist that clearly was not followed."}
