{"text":"*Fantastic* food.   Their homemade butter and lemon butter sauce are sublime... It is really hard not to like the food from this restaurant."}
{"text":"It was just ok. I went in for lunch during  a weekday with my husband. There were the ladies who lunch that filled the whole restaurant practically. I think my husband was the only male customer there. So we sat in the bar area.   We ordered a pizza and a pasta dish. They were ok.   Also, the size of the restaurant is not that big."}
{"text":"Many great places to dine in Hudson, comparatively this one does not measure up. We had great service but the food ( with the exception of our salads) needs a lot of work. Entrees were poor, dessert equally unsatisfactory."}
{"text":"Really great location but very small and overly casual for Hudson. My wife's chicken was overcooked and the sauce was very watery. I ordered baked ravioli, unfortunately it was mediocre at best.  If you are looking for casual dining, and mediocre Italian food in Hudson, then by all means stop by,"}
{"text":"Ambience, service 5 stars. Food 3.5 stars. So overall 4 stars. Ordered crab cakes for appetizers and I had the Chicken Saltimboca and wifey had Eggplant Parmigiana. Both were between okay and good and not great. Our server was nice and the location and ambience was nice too, food was good but I have had better italian food before hence only 4 stars. I would definitely try them again."}
{"text":"We went in for a late lunch with my in-laws and we are very glad we did. It was not crowded at the time and the service was great. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food. Fresh ingredients and you could taste it! The bruschetta and mozzarella were amazing appetizers. Dishes we ordered included salads, chicken and veal parm, penne arrabiata.  The kids loved their chicken tenders and penne. My son also got the arrabiata sauce and he ate every last bite. The guys also got the tomato basil soup and said it was the best they have ever tasted. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Pretty good Italian and surprisingly good seafood.    A problem with discrepancy's with the menu prices.  The online happy hour menu (http://www.tomatogrill.com/Bar_Menu.html) says $5 martini.  The happy hour menu on the table says $6 martini.  Ordered the happy hour menu and it cost $6.75."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Tomato Grill a number of times. Up until recently I've considered it perfectly average, with good service and a nice atmosphere. The one upside is that they are one of the few places in the area that accept reservations.  On 4/27/12 that all changed. Shortly before we arrived we learned that we would have one more person joining us and we had hoped Tomato Grill would be able to accommodate us. Upon our arrival, we mentioned this to our young greeter, who wasted no time snapping at us \"We can't do it! Maybe if you'd called earlier in the day, but now there's nothing we can do!\" We asked her to check with the manager. She returned shortly to inform us that as she suspected, we could not be accommodated, and would \"just have to wait\" for the next table to be ready, reasoning that placing an additional chair at a table for six would be too congested in the dining area. While this was obviously not ideal, we waited in the small space between the bar and the check-in area for the next suitable table to become available. As each new member of our party arrived, they asked why we were still waiting when we'd made a reservation, and as I was explaining our situation to one of the last arriving members of our party, also adding my opinion that having seven people standing in the entryway, seemingly meant for approximately four people was no better than the seating issue at hand, the young woman snapped at me \"Do I need to get my manager?\" I explained that wouldn't be necessary, but she felt the need to clarify what she meant and said, and in a demeaning, almost threatening tone: \"No, I mean, if you continue to make comments about the situation, I'm going to get my manager.\" I told her that would be perfect and that I'd love the opportunity to speak with the owner or manager. Shortly thereafter, not only did she NOT return with anyone, but we were seated as a party of seven at a table obviously meant for six. A manager NEVER arrived at our table to discuss the situation, and we never received any sort of apology from our inappropriately rude greeter, nor did she wish us a good evening as we departed.   I feel the entire evening's feeling of what should have been a happy occasion was brought to a screeching halt by the lack of professionalism of the young woman greeting customers, who eventually ended up spending over two hundred dollars in this establishment. On a positive note - our server was WONDERFUL!!! Because our party was seven, our gratuity was included, but I felt that she deserved more, so I ended up giving her an additional 5%. While I certainly understand that Friday evenings at 7:30 are a peak time for any restaurant, the general demeanor of our greeter put a negative spin on a situation that could have been handled calmly and coolly had she just taken a breath, asked us to give her a moment to speak with management, and then come back and explain the situation to us. Being barked at like we should know better was unprofessional and rude. Seeing as how we ended up as a party of seven at a table meant for six only added a further sour note to the evening, as that is what we'd asked to have done thirty to forty minutes earlier when we arrived. While I wouldn't call myself a \"regular\", this was my fifth or sixth time in this establishment over the past year. I can also say that without a doubt, it will be my last. I have, and will continue to share this experience with those interested in dining in the Hudson area, and encourage them to use one of the numerous alternatives in Hudson: Rosewood Grill, Hudson's, Luchita's, One Red Door, Pad Thai, Flipside, and Solaire - some similarly priced that serve far more exceptional food than Tomato Grill."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Service was fair at best.   Everyone was very nice but I had to steal silverware and salt/pepper from a nearby table, my server only came by a few times, and I had to ask for bread and for a refill on my wine.  Will come back for food alone though.   Butternut Squash soup was out of this world!!"}
{"text":"Writing without having eaten the food, frustrated that at 7:20pm my party was turned away to wait ten minutes until our 7:30pm reservation time. At 8:00pm without a table, we left."}
{"text":"Skip this place when in Hudson.   The good is just not good. Pasta was over cooked as well at the meat.  Tried it for brunch and it was a very small menu of sub-par items.  It's hard to mess up Italian food, but that's just what they did."}
{"text":"A total disappointment. The entire experience was sub par. We had a party of 6, 4 adults & 2 kids with reservations at 7:30p. Since it was Friday night & 1st & main has live music on the square, we came up a little early (7:10) I checked us in with the hostess, to let them know we were here, but would be walking around. The hostess said, \"well, it's 7:10 & your reservation isn't until 7:30) .. Yeah, I can tell time, we were just checking in!!! Anyway, dinner... We ordered the kids dinners right away... Thank goodness, the rest of our orders took FOREVER! All of out dinners (except the Cajun chicken pizza) were sub par. Honestly, if you order chicken parm, the chicken SHOULD NOT BE TYSON CHICKEN STRIPS!!! My sister added a meatball to her pasta dish, meatball had NO FLAVOR! My chicken fettuccine was bland and had maybe 1-2oz of chicken.  Service, was SLOW... Had to wait 10 minutes to flag Nancy down to ask for ketchup for my daughters chicken fingers, had to remind her that she offered to refill the bread basket, she forgot to bring chili flakes after the dinner dishes were served...  Refills on beverages only offered after the meal was over, empty glasses were there when dinner was served.  We didn't do dessert. It was already after 9p with the one course!!! I used to really like this place... Won't be back ..."}
{"text":"Garbage. Hours go to 1030 on Saturday nights. Was walking in at 1015 and the bartender told the busboy to run up and flip the open sign over to closed as we were walking up. Called and they said they were really slow so they were closing. Every other decent restaurant is jammed at 1015 on a Saturday. Tells you something about this place. If you have to close early on a Saturday your restaurant has problems. Especially an \"Italian\" place. If you can even call it that. I've lived in Hudson 35 years. There are at least 15 places I would have eaten at before I even considered going here....and one of those is chipotle."}
{"text":"Pretty bland food. Nothing special at all,  and wayyyyy overpriced. $108 for a group of 3. Bruschetta was the best part of the meal. Marinara was flavorless, and a small portion for $15. Older clientele. Crowded and loud."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this newly found restaurant...Food and service was very good...I  got the baked ravioli with the rope sausage.....very good...had to order the salad ala carte which I don't know why it could not be included in the meal...a little pricey, but we fully enjoyed....we would go back again...."}
{"text":"There are so many great little restaurants in Hudson, I guess I expected way more out of this one.  I had a cup of wedding soup (note...their \"cup\" is a large bowl, which is not a bad thing...just way more than I had anticipated before a meal).  The soup was delicious and had a lot of fresh carrots and really fresh spinach.  My problem was my main course.  I ordered the crab stuffed salmon.  I'm very particular when it comes to salmon, so although it's one of my favorites, I only get it when I'm at a place where I'm pretty certain it's going to be a good piece.  I could immediately tell that it was frozen long term before cooking (this ruins the fatty texture of salmon and leaves it crumbly and dry) and it had bits of bone in it.  The crab stuffing was imitation crab, not the real thing.  The price certainly did not match the quality and I likely won't be back."}
{"text":"As a Hudson resident, I've dined at Tomato Grill on numerous occasions and until recently, had been pleased with the quality of food and service. However, my most recent (and last) visit was a disaster.  I made 7:00 pm reservations for our party of five (30-something women who were hoping to have a pleasant evening of dining, drinking and catching up), most of whom were out of town guests, and I am beyond disappointed with the entire experience. Keep in mind that this review comes from someone who worked as a waitress for several years in college, so I understand how difficult the profession can be and I'm extremely understanding of situations that are out of a server's control (a slow/busy kitchen or bar, etc). However, I have zero tolerance for poor, disrespectful service, which is exactly what we were given at Tomato Grill.  First of all, our server never introduced herself (it turns out that her name is Nancy, which we learned upon her wordless delivery of our checks at the end of the meal), never smiled, never responded to us when we placed our drinks, appetizers or entree orders with so much as a grunt, much less a thank you. In addition to the rude service, all of our orders took entirely too long to be delivered--glasses of wine arrived 15 minutes after we placed the order, appetizers took 20+ minutes, and we had to request water refills from the hostess. When the appetizers arrived, we were still stuck with our menus (as Nancy never came back to take our dinner orders, much less check on our satisfaction with our drinks or inquire about another round), so we were stuck holding the menus on our laps while trying to eat our appetizers.   When Nancy finally did take our entree orders, she acted as though she was doing us a favor--no response, no thank you--she simply wordlessly took the orders and then walked away, and left the empty appetizer plates on the table. After our entrees were delivered (and we had to request that the appetizer plates be cleared), Nancy never came back to inquire about our satisfaction with our meals or to see if there was anything else that we'd like--perhaps another round of drinks that would increase the balance of our checks, and in theory, Nancy's potential tip (freshly grated cheese or cracked black pepper was never an option at our table either). Nancy finally showed back up after about 20 minutes after we'd finished our meals to inquire about dessert. We politely declined, as we were beyond frustrated with the horrible service we'd received for the past two hours. At this point, we requested to speak with a manager and were greeted by... another server? She informed us that she was \"the closest thing\" to a manager at that time. Really?! There's NO MANAGER available to speak with customers on a Saturday night?!! So, we relayed our disappointment with our dining experience to this \"closest thing\" to a manager/server and she offered up a vague \"sorry to hear about that,\" a blank stare, and a free dessert. Are you kidding me?!!! I'd expect a MUCH higher level of concern or eagerness to remedy the situation of a table who's bill was over $200. When we requested to be compensated with more than a free dessert, we received a 10% discount. What a joke. I'll certainly never return to Tomato Grill and will make sure to inform everyone I know that there are plenty of other restaurant options in the Hudson area (many within walking distance of Tomato Grill, as a matter of fact) that value their customers and their business."}
{"text":"Food was just okay but not wow. Wine was good. Service was abysmal. Not real authentic Italian."}
{"text":"While visiting my bf's family in the area we decided to grab a bite to eat at Tomato Grill. We arrived Friday evening around 6 p.m. and I had a feeling they would have a wait for a table. We did not call ahead to make a reservation and maybe we should have. When we asked the hostess for a table she didn't seem to have anything available and asked if we made a reservation which we had not. She told us that she didn't know if a table would become available for at least 30-45 minutes, but she did recommend the bar area instead. The bar area was fine for us and there were exactly 4 chairs left so it was perfect.   We sat down at the bar and were greeted by our server. She was really friendly and offered us drinks while placing the menus in front of us. I wish I remembered her name, but I just can't think of it. Anyway, since I was visiting  Great Lakes state I had to try one of the Great Lakes beers (Dortmunder) and it was exactly what I needed. the bartender/server gave us some time to look over the menu and left us alone for a bit while we made decisions. The family decided to order the bruschetta for an appetizer and then we each ordered an entree. I opted for the eggplant parmesan.   Our bartender was great at making sure we each had enough to drink and she kept checking on us to let us know that the kitchen was working on our order (she knew it was taking a long time). The appetizer came out and looked great and tasted great so that was a good start to the meal. Then when our meals came I was slightly disappointed. My eggplant parmesan looked a bit disappointing and seemed to be loaded with more cheese to make it look more filling. The eggplant itself was quite soggy and didn't taste anything like what it should have. I ate about 1/3 of my meal, but opted to eat more of the pasta with marinara sauce instead. The pasta was very plain and the sauce wasn't seasoned very well. It was definitely not a meal I would go back for.   If I could give our server/bartender 5 stars I would, but since the food was lacking in flavor I have to give 3 stars with hopes that they will improve...or maybe they do better on a night when they aren't as busy?   There are plenty of other good places to visit in the area for dinner so I would suggest skipping dinner at the Tomato Grill...maybe just go for drinks and apps instead."}
{"text":"The food is awesome here .. had the veal oscar this past Saturday, and it was outstanding. The grilled vegetables were delicious, and the meat prepared perfectly and very high quality.   When crowded, it can be noisy and hard to hear conversation."}
{"text":"Wish I had checked the reviews before we came because many wrote how I felt.  Apparently this restaurant doesn't care to improve.  Reviews  written as far back as two years ago could have been written about our meal.  The restaurant appears clean and though small, it's nice.  The food is underwhelming.  Small portions of so so food at nice prices.  Nothing more to say about it for little effort is put into presenting a tasteful meal with any ounce of imagination.  When we returned to our car everyone in our party said the same thing, \"I don't need to return there.\""}
{"text":"Tomatoe Grill is very delicious! Everything on your dish is absolutely fresh, served by very respectable and very friendly staff. The manager also serves, and has a wonderful time with all the customers that come to enjoy the food. I'm more than thankful to come to a restaurant, who puts customer satisfaction and social responsibility top of there priority list!"}
{"text":"We came here with the family for dinner on a Monday night, and was very pleased with the food, service and atmosphere. We started with the baked stuffed tomato appetizer, and then tried several different pizzas, the veal scarpariello and the linguini in garlic and oil.  A few nits: The tomato app was ok, but lacked real gusto in the flavor department - surprising as it looks soooo good. The pizza crust was comparatively bland and uninspired, but then again, we're from the east coast where brick oven baked crust is king.   Overall, the food itself was very good. The freshness and quality is evident in each plate, and the presentation is very well done. Service was top notch despite it being a busy time. We all left sated, and can easily give a solid 4-stars to the Tomato Grill."}
{"text":"So this is the spot that my cousin chose for our post-celebration dinner on a Saturday night. We had reservations for our party of 8 and were seated promptly. Our server was great and rolled with our nonsense which was lovely.  The food was excellent. I am a 3rd coast seafood snob but had been assured by my relatives (who grew up in Louisiana and know) that the seafood was of great quality. And they were right, the shrimp and scallop cappellini was delicious. I also enjoyed my boston bibb salad, the gorgonzola kept it from being too sweet. Judging from the clean plates from the rest of my group, I'd say that everyone enjoyed their meals.  Various wines and beers were enjoyed by our group. I ordered the cucumber martini with vodka and it was OK. Definitely need some other non-sweet cocktails on their menu.   Then, of course, we had to have desserts. We had both the special candy cane brulee and rasberry brulee. They bring out a big tray with all the desserts of the day when you ask, so be prepared to be tempted. They all looked delish."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is going downhill.  The veal is burnt and the artichokes are as well.  The bartender denied they have a new cook. I have eaten there 15 times and I am not buying it. Removed from my favorites list."}
{"text":"Not as authentic as the real thing but it's a GREAT take on American Italian cooking. Atmosphere nothing special pretty generic along with service.  But would go back if a friend desired so."}
{"text":"Not so great service from the waitress.  Had to find her to get the bill  The food was way overpriced in comparison for what you get.  Nothing special.  The presentation was not good.  Too mundane for the prices."}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  Great both times.  Went there with 3 other people a couple days ago.  Made reservations online because the first time I went there my group of 3, we had to wait over an hour to be seated.  This time we were seated right away.  They have a good drink selection.  No beer on tap, which was a disappointment.    The pizzas are delicious.  Had the mussels for an appetizer.  It was my first time having mussels and I was pleasantly surprised.  The menu is pretty extensive.    The atmosphere is nice.  They actually dim the lights at some point (maybe 8:30 or 9).  The food took awhile to come out, but the company and service in between was nice enough to not annoy me."}
{"text":"I have eaten both lunch and dinner here. The food is okay. Not spectacular but adequate Italian food.   All their choices are ala carte so no matter what you get you have to pay extra for a salad or pasta to go with chicken or veal. Personally I hate that. Pasta has to cost pennies for most restaurants so to charge me an extra $4 is just plain greedy. So you pay $21 for chicken parm or $25 with added pasta. Then add $6 for a salad. Again, maybe it's just me, but I think that's a ripoff.   Service is okay. I always feel the servers here are pushing for the highest bill possible. Also if your a dry wine drinker, your at home. They don't have any sweet wines. Too bad for me.   You will get an ok meal. Pay a good amount for it. But that's it."}
{"text":"I love this place. You can always get a table, the kids can color on the table, the food is good and the service has always been good as well."}
{"text":"This is great, quiet place to meet for dinner. Great food, great service!  The only thing I wish they would have is a variety of beers on tap. They have none."}
{"text":"I finally got to go here last Friday for dinner with some friends.  I've had this on my list since the days it was next to the Acme on 303 and for whatever reason just never got there.  In a nutshell - I think the 3 star rating it currently has is about right.  The food wasn't bad, in fact some of the dishes were really good.  It was just so uneven.  My wedding soup had the best taste of just about any wedding soup I'd ever had, except it came out barely lukewarm.  It wasn't hot enough to wilt the handful of fresh spinach that was tossed in before serving (a nice touch).  I got the lasagna with meat sauce.  I'm a huge pasta fan and lasagna is one of my favorites to get out.  Taste on this one was just okay.  The meat sauce looked like marinara with a couple meat balls broken up around the side, and the meatballs had a weird taste.  Continuing the theme of things not hot enough, after a couple bites, I noticed a huge \"cheese slick\" on the top - about a 1/4 inch of cheese that was probably cooked at one point, but now looked like frozen yellow lava (pic uploaded - not sure how to link to it).  I was with a party of 5 and others seemed to like their selections.  So again, I'd say the three star rating here is appropriate.  I'd also agree with the reviewer saying that given the other dining choices in Hudson, Tomato Grill overall doesn't measure up.  An okay visit, but I don't I'd go back."}
{"text":"We have dined here a lot over the years; it is hit or miss lately but a recent visit was a big miss.. we were wedged in between a table of 8 and 12 and guess who got the bad service..our sad little table of 3. No refills waited forever for food, etc. I ordered the halibut special because of health reasons and I saw one being served that looked great...mine was thin, dry and the accompaniments did not work with it.. I had a little bit of risotto and enough fennel root to fill a person up. The offer to make me another was half hearted and I waited 45 min for the one I got so I declined on that premise...worst thing...no manager to be found. We are done with this place after many years of being a loyal patron. There is nobody managing the place.. our server was so busy it was not on her to talk to me about the experience ..they all knew we were upset and just wanted us , the \"problem\" out of there."}
{"text":"a fan.  its a quiet place that is bright with good food.  We kind of forget about the place, living in Hudson, because we do not pass it.  90% of the time we go for lunch and use them for catering parties.    If your kids are well behaved then bring them.  If they act up (or act like kids do) then I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Tomato Grill staff accommodated a large group late lunch after a sad occasion and service was excellent. Food was tasty, hot, and served to entire group at once. I would recommend the ambience and we were charmed with lovely Hudson."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there tonight for New Years Eve.  Our reservation was at 7:30pm.  We didn't get seated until closer to 8pm.  We first grabbed a drink at the bar.  My husband had an espresso martini which he said tasted like a 50/50 ratio of espresso vodka and water.  I had the red sipper which was raspberry puree and champagne.  The glass got ridiculously sticky and the drink was just \"eh\".  For an appetizer I was head over heels for the herb crusted goat cheese.  SO GOOD.  We shared a Boston bibb salad which the half was enough for the two of us to share at the recommendation of the waitress.  My husband loooooved the linguini and clams and the gnocchi and chicken was just okay.  I have a ton leftover from eating so much.  We also got the chocolate mousse cake for dessert which was tasty but nothing spectacular.  Service was slow.  After we were seated it took a number of minutes to have our waitress come to our table.  Getting leftovers boxed, getting our check, etc. all took far longer than I felt it should.  It's a cute place, however.  I will likely return."}
{"text":"I had Eggplant Parmigiana which is pretty hard to mess up, but this was the worst I've had. I had hoped for authentic eggplant what I got was a mess that was fashioned to look and taste like the real deal. It was thin,  very little sauce, and even less mozzarella.  I guess I'll stick to Olive Garden, at least I know what to expect there and you even get pasta with it at OG.  Won't be returning"}
{"text":"We have never been here for dinner, but have for lunch. Their lunch pricing, even on weekends, is very reasonable for good food. Not sure if this carries over to dinner.   I noticed the prices are considerably more for dinner, which may be for the same portions. Kind of like a Chinese restaurant is so much more expensive at night. Never understood that. It is a nice restaurant though and we had good service and food."}
{"text":"$10.50 for cheese ravioli with very little taste even with the added meat sauce that cost an additional $2. Sigh.  Nice staff and great location. Loud at lunch with wheelers and dealers talking business literally at your shoulder."}
{"text":"This will be the last time we dine at the Tomato Grill. While the ambiance  is wonderful, the food very good and the prices reasonable, we are just too darned tired of waiting and waiting and waiting for our food.  We had brunch there today, and couldn't believe how long we had to wait for our meals. Our server was very friendly (which hasn't always been the case in the past), but never once apologized for the long wait.  The restaurant wasn't very crowded, which causes me to wonder if I'd still be there had there been more customers.  We are so disappointed, but will have to find a new favorite place."}
{"text":"Why is your hostess wearing work out gear?   Seriously.  Work.  Out. Gear.   And while the food is very good the staff needs some work.  And by some work I mean trained or replaced.    It's your business....I would never have my hostess look like she's just come from the gym.   Nor would I have a waitress who doesn't say thank you to me as I'm leaving.   There are more and more options in Hudson, I'm more likely to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Okay! I made it back for dinner last night. Ordered the breaded artichoke appetizer to share. It was delicious, with just the right amount of breading and a sublime lemon sauce it was plated on top of. For my dinner I ordered the Veal Picatta and it was excellent, with artichokes and a similar lemon sauce to the appetizer. Veal is hard to cook and this was done to perfection! My friend had the Veal Saltimbocca and pronounced it to be excellent as well. Our server, Elizabeth, was exceptional in that she never rushed, and left us to our conversation for what turned out to be a fairly long and enjoyable meal. The wine list is not big, but well crafted, and we had a bottle of the Folie a Deux Zinfandel, which was reasonably priced and very good. All in all, after a great lunch and now a dinner, this is a \"will definitely be back\" destination."}
{"text":"Shameful hostess. We'd been waiting for our table for 15, then the hostess sat a party that came in after us because the woman of the other party gave the hostess a look. 0/10 would not dine again."}
{"text":"Ate at Tomato Grill for the first time tonight.  Food was mediocre at best (D'Angelo's is much better and authentic). Be prepared to be nickel and dimed for everything. Son ordered the kid's spaghetti and meatballs. Charged an unexpected  $1 upcharge to change pasta to angel hair (capellini) and $1 per meatball. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan and was asked if I wanted pasta for an additional charge so I settled for the lasagna. It was a mushy pile of overlooked noodles and bland ricotta cheese. Our daughter had the best comment for her fettuccine Alfredo:  \"I can't eat this because it smells like (our cat's name) food.\"  There are better options for less expensive and tastier pasta in the area."}
{"text":"We were hopeful about this little restaurant but were pretty disappointed all around. The hostess never seems to be at the front. The bread was subpar and cold but the spread was good...it was the only good food outside of the wine. My boyfriend ordered chicken parm, which was bland. I ordered chicken Marsala which was dry, without flavor and the sauce was watery. The prices are too high for the flavor-less food we received and they charge extra if u want anything more than just a couple pieces of chicken. Very, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent salads, I had veal Oscar and Mary had linguini putanesca. Both very good, would order them again."}
{"text":"I have dined here for lunch and dinner for years!  The service, even when busy, is top notch.  The pasta is consistently prepared al dente as requested.  The wine list is varied and affordable.  Get the homemade pizza - you won't be disappointed!  When my fiance brought me here for dinner they treated us like royalty."}
{"text":"Excellent food and we get take out regularly.  Service in restaurant is ok but not up to the food and beer and wine selection is just ok.  Overall though, very under appreciated Hudson restaurant.  The herb crusted chicken and veal a la tini are excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. The restaurant is small. The service was fine. Things started off well. Warm bread accompanied by an herbed butter came out. The food, however, was disappointing. The bowl of soup had very little substance, mostly broth. It would've benefitted from some cheese, which I wasn't offered but a table next to us was later. The veal with the signature d'agnese preparation (lemon butter sauce and artichoke) was laughably small. Two tiny pieces of meat filled 20percent of the plate. Furthermore, the amount of breading was more than the amount of meat. The steamed broccoli took up half the plate and was mushy in texture. There was literally one sad piece of thickly breaded artichoke. The signature lemon butter sauce was bland and disappointing. The one saving grace of the meal was the beet salad. While not large, it was fresh and tasty. The shaved fennel on the top was a nice touch."}
{"text":"I don't eat a lot of Italian food (or, what most of it is, Italian-inspired food) because very rarely is it any good. It's usually American-style. Heavy on the pasta, heavy on the sauces, heavy on hips. And if I'm going to add to my hips, I can do that far better in my own kitchen than someone can in a restaurant.   Which is why Tomato Grill was surprising. I had the Bibb lettuce salad with the veal saltimbocca (my one, true love). The salad was perfect. The gorgonzola cheeese + strawberries + dried cherries was a delightful combination with the balsamic vinaigrette. I do wish I had gotten a different salad though, as there was one with port wine poached pears. And that just sounds mind-blowing.  The veal was well-done. Not perfect, but very well-done.  The prosciutto was perfectly crispy under a thin layer of cheese. The veal was very lightly breaded and still crispy under the marsala sauce. I'm usually not a fan of saltimbocca with marsala in the sauce, but again, they really did a nice job on this one. The spinach was perfect, and the asparagus I ordered separately was a bit softer than I like, but the lemon sauce on it made me want to lick the plate.  Service was decent. Had the service been better, TG would have gotten a full 5 stars. But as is the case, they did lose a star on service. The restaurant was not busy in the least, but I couldn't help feeling a bit neglected when my water sat empty and I had to request a lime for my gin three times before it finally came. Greatly appreciated the waitress boxing up my meal for me. I feel like I usually make a mess, so nothing annoys me more than having to box up my meal."}
{"text":"Solid.  I be eaten here 3-4 times, my wife & kids were hooked right away, they loved it.  Took me a little longer, but I'm sold. You could eat well here just having apps.  Each is a solid portion for 2-3 to share.  The ravioli, with goat cheese cream sauce, spinach and crab is a favorite.  The calamari is excellent, with plenty of tentacles (I hate it when it's all rings).  My wife loves the rack of lamb app (4 chops), it's usually her entree. I had the gorgonzola crusted mahimahi.  The fish was slightly overdone, but saved by the pool of sauce surrounding it (red wine reduction and demi-glace).  Sounds like an odd combo, but it works, although it didn't highlight the fish itself.  Kids were very happy with the fettucini Alfredo."}
{"text":"Our second time trying this restaurant... second time we were disappointed. Mussels- please don't try. Not fresh. My pasta dish was so spicy it was inedible. A dish with that much heat should have a warning on the menu... and I can usually handle spicy food. After picking through it and painfully swallowing no more than four bites, I could not finish. When the server collected our dishes, my pasta had been untouched for quite some time. Server was a bit irritated at me and chastised me for not giving notice. I was totally embarrassed. I just chomped on the table bread for the remaining time. Server should have- at least- given a bit of a discount on my meal. It was not given. Two out of three bad meals at the table, $100 meal... fooled twice. Never again."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time with my aunt and my cousin. First I would like to say, almost everything we had was pretty good.   However, as I have read it from a couple reviewers and will reiterate: STAY AWAY FROM THE PORT WINE REDUCTION! Omg, it was horrible. My aunt got, I forget the name of the dish, but something chicken with goat cheese, portabella mushrooms, and the port wine reduction sauce. The dish was swimming in the sauce, which had it been good, might have been ok. But the taste is simply awful. My cousin and aunt described it as rancid soy sauce.   Other than that, I had their signature dish with chicken and the lemon butter sauce. Now that sauce was fantastic! We had a couple sides of linguine (also with the same sauce) and potatoes. Both of which you have to order ala cart, but they were generously portioned and worth it because we shared.   We had creme brulee and raspberry cheesecake for dessert. The raspberry cheesecake was tasty and very attractive plating. The creme brulee was standard, but they burnt a quarter sized section and tried to hide it with whipped cream. As if when we started eating it we wouldn't notice it tasted burnt.   I will probably go for a second visit. But now we all know, nothing NOTHING with port wine sauce!"}
{"text":"I had some really great food and the service was excellent. I had the crispy ravioli to start (sumptuous, rich, wonderful), veal piccata (veal slightly overdone, but still lovely and flavorful). Serving sides a la carte is a bit steep at this price, and my risotto was bland and not made with arborio rice. My dad's gnocchi were similarly bland.  It's a bit too bright inside. Also, this might seem a bizarre criticism, but I wish the menu were a bit smaller. There are so many items, it's hard to choose! I think they'd do better to have a slightly smaller, more seasonal menu. Also, the portion sizes are huuuuge. This is both good and bad -- leftovers are nice to have, but they're never as good as the original. I ordered a starter and main course, and had to box part of the starter so I'd have room for the main. I had no room for dessert!   I think they could halve the portion size, knock 25% off the price, and have happy customers & more profits. They'd end up with more people ordering 3 courses and feeling satisfied.  Definitely a great place to eat -- the food & service were truly enjoyable -- but the experience is what falls short because of the size of the menu and portion sizes. I'd definitely go again but I think I might split dishes."}
{"text":"Nice place to dine. We walked in on a Sunday afternoon when shopping in the area. It was a little more upscale then we thought! They have a nice menu, lots of italian food of course but some other things mixed in. Nice selection of beer and plenty of wine.  The service was a little slow and took a little while for the food to come out. However, the meal was great. I wouldn't go here for a quick bite with the kids. They have a kids menu but dining at Tomato Grill would be more enjoyable with adults only!  Definitely check it out. A little pricey but worth the experience! Great spot for date night."}
{"text":"Their food may be delicious however I wouldn't know because after making a reservation at 7:30 and arriving on time I waited for 30 minutes to be seated before giving up and leaving to go eat at Panera.  If I could give no stars I would."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative review I would.  This place doesn't deserve even 1 star after our experience tonight.  We have lived in Hudson for 15 years.  We never had such a horrid experience anywhere in this town!  We walked in at 7pm.  The girl came to the hostess stand and said she only had a high top for our party of 5.  I said ok we'll take it.  She sat us and brought us drinks in a timely matter.  But from this point forward it just went all down hill.   We were chatting amongst ourselves for quite awhile.  Then I realized our server had not been back to our table to take our order for a good 20 minutes!! We noticed she was running the bar, sitting people and then waiting some tables.  She noticed that we were watching her and finally came by to take our order.  We didn't say anything, we ordered.  She brought out bread for our table.  Then it took forever to get the goat cheese appetizer we ordered.  I had asked her if that app was good for 5 people, she had said 'yes, if you have extra toast.' Well when she brought it there was no extra toast.   She didn't say anything and we didn't bother to say anything.  Then when she came back 10 minutes later (because she was clearing a table by us) she saw we had goat cheese left and the toast was gone, so she said 'your extra toast is coming, the guy in the back dropped it, then he burnt it.' whatever, we didn't really care and just said 'ok, thanks.' And she walked away and brought the extra toast in 5 minutes.    Then dinner took forever to come.  When it did we all dug in.  My hubby ordered the Cajun chix pizza.  He hated it, but tried to eat it but he complained the whole time.  She was no where to be seen.  Another person at our table ordered a regular pizza w/pepperoni and it was so doughy. these pizza's cost $18 each and were worse then a school lunch pizza!   The Cajun pizza tasted and smelled like Taco seasoning!   The toppings were literally sitting on top ofthe pizza instead of being cooked in a little like every other pizza out there!  And not to mention very little topping w/so much dough left! 12\" pizza $18! My chicken saltimbocca was good.  My sons fettuccini looked like it was done much earlier and sitting while everything else cooked.  I had a side of linguini w/marinara.  It was very light on the marinara so I wanted to ask for more.  I waited and waited and waited.  She wasn't anywhere to be seen!  Hiding out in back or something.  I ate all my chicken and my hubby ate half his pizza.  She finally came out right to our table and asked if everything was ok.  I asked her if I could get extra marinara, she said yes and was off to get it.  She brought it out and I said thanks and she was off again.  Everyone I was with chatted as I finished my pasta.  We chatted awhile longer before she came by to ask if we were done and wanted boxes.  My hubby was the only one with food left.  I told her we are done but no box.  I continued to tell her that my hubby won't tell you this, but he hated that pizza.  I told her how it smelled and tasted like Taco seasoning instead of Cajun.  All she said was 'o.k' and walked away!! No gee, I'm sorry you didn't like it or anything!  I was shocked.   So we waited and she brought the bill.  18% gratuity already added for a party if 5!  What! Ok, so you treat us like shit cause as you pointed out when we complained about that, that it says it right in the menu 18% gratuity for 5 or more.  Oh, and she also charged us $18 for the pizza my hubby hated! When she came to get the check, I asked for a manger, and she said she was the manager!!! Again, utter shock!  She said cause we didn't complain when she was by the 1st time (when I asked for extra marinara and she left to get it) is why she charged us.  And also cause he ate a few pieces.  I told her he ate the pieces cause she was never returning after we started eating!  That's why everyone was done when she did come back and I asked for extra sauce!! So I said, 'then charge us for half the pizza then.' She said no!  She was being so mean and rude we couldn't believe it!  Which made us get angry with her!! My hubby told her he didn't want to pay the 18% gratuity after how she treated us and the fact we were there for 2 hours!  She told us if we don't pay it she'll call the police!!! Wait what is happening here!!  Omg! When I complained about the pizza earlier, I said it was worse then a school lunch pizza, so after we paid and we're getting up to leave, she asked loudly to another couple sitting at the bar eating  so we could hear, if their pizza tasted like a school lunch pizza and they said no.  Ok.  So if you have a party of 5 or more, definitely stay away from this place.  Apparently even the management thinks it's ok to treat you like crap cause they are getting their tip anyway.  Also, don't get the pizza!  Every other place out there has much better pizza!  Matter of fact, get a frozen one from the grocery store and cook it at home, much better!"}
{"text":"The Happy hour prices were moderate on food...we had the calamari but it was a bit rubbery & not very well flavored. The Xmas ale was cold & sorely needed. The mahi mahi entree special was very tasty & maybe one of the best menu items. Ambience was pleasant & not too noisy in the bar area."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food at a gem in the small quaint little old and renovated Hudson. This place is such a devine place for a quick lunch in you work around the area or a romantic late dinner with the one you love. From the always changing special menus to the consistency of the pasta dishes, every plate comes out at a higher degree than most regular five star restaurants. The overall scene of upscale yet casual enough to enjoy quickly keeps this a place to come back as often as possible."}
{"text":"Great appetizers ... were so old we split a dinner.  Great wine and drink selection     We had the appetizers ... calamari, lamb and bruschetta.   We spit the scallops. Yum. Our friends split the crab stuffed salmon.   Don't miss the deserts ... we couldn't decide so we shared the key lime cheesecake, carrot cake and chocolate lave type cake. All delicious!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal today. Very authentic Italian cuisine accompanied by a comprehensive wine menu. Friendly staff and a fair price. Will return next time we're in Hudson."}
{"text":"Found and made the reservation through Open Table where it is 4.3 stars! Brunch was amazing. Great breakfast and Italian lunch options. Drove 45 mins and not disappointed."}
{"text":"My guest and I had a weird start here. As the hostess started to seat us, the phone rang, and she took several calls abruptly while in conversation with us. Their phone didn't stop ringing! Good for them, but maybe they can tweak their system. We awkwardly stood in the entry while she took each call and waited for her to be done. We weren't sure if we should come back or not.  Cue up dinner. I ordered the crab stuffed salmon (which is also one of the most expensive things on the menu). My guest had the eggplant parmigiana. To be honest, I can't say I would get this again. I wasn't a fan of the juice/sauce it was in. Everything here is a la carte-- including getting a side of basic spaghetti for your entree (I think $4, yikes). If I ever come back, I will opt for a pizza. I stole a few bites of my guest's eggplant, and that was quite tasty.  We saw our server very infrequently. We were there during an off-time, and there was only one other group in the restaurant with about 8 people. They seemed to be getting the attention of the servers. I get it girl, get that tip! But please check on your other tables when you have the time...we're here, too! The restaurant itself is cute, clean and in a great location. I don't think I really hit the ticket on ordering the right thing on the menu, but they do have a vast selection!"}
{"text":"I went here with my husband on my birthday. I was super excited because I spent a really long time looking for a fun place to eat before we went to a movie. Te crowd was older, but it was pleasant inside. We waited at least 20 minutes before a waitress even came to our table once we say down. We ordered an app and a couple salads and some drinks. She took at least another 30 minutes to get those and then we put in our order. After another 40 minutes or so we had actually flag her down and ask her how much longer bc we had a movie to catch. She said 15 min and we couldn't wait. So if you have a good 3 hours to eat, go here and tell me how the food is because I only got as far as a salad an calamari and neither blew me away that's for sure. I will never be back here."}
{"text":"we ate here yesterday,yesterdays  twas wonderful, food was great, waiter was great Came back today, different story,  waitress could have cared less, soup was WAY too salty, going to send it back but never saw the waitress again  Will try somewhere else next time"}
{"text":"8 of us had dinner for the first time at Tomato Grill last night, from ages 15 to 78.  The restaurant lived up to its solid ratings.  The food was excellent, presented beautifully, the menu was sufficiently varied to keep all ages happy, and the service was very good.  We were well-attended by our server who allowed us to socialize and eat at a leisurely pace.  My veal shank was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and everybody was happy.  The calamari was a tad overcooked but not by much; presentation of the appetizers was beautiful.  We will return."}
{"text":"This is the second time that David and I have eaten here. Last time we both had 1/2 salads. David had the Caesar and I had the Butter lettuce salad.  I decided to get a whole salad and David had the lasagna again.  The salad was large enough to be a meal.  I added chicken to the salad but did not like it.  It was marinated in something that gave it  a weird taste.  The rest of the salad was superb.  The flavors complemented each other and the dressing didn't over power it.  The garlic butter and bread is to die for.     The food is really amazing."}
{"text":"They fix a great Bloody Mary. Brunch is serve on Sunday's. good time to relax and let the world go by. Eat here with family or just friends. Free parking. I would recommend the pancakes. They are light, fluffy, and so good. Take the time and check it out."}
{"text":"Really great local place. Great food and service. Went here with some coworkers for lunch and had a great time."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant for many many years, as it is a convenient halfway point for me to meet friends for both lunch and dinner.  But last nite was the last time for me.  We had an issue with our bill and asked to speak to the manager.  As we were gently arguing our case, she said she was done talking and walked away.  She then went just behind the wall and started ranting to the other employees loudly, so that we could hear it all.  Then denied doing it, told us to leave and that we weren't welcome back.  So so so unprofessional and rude.  Won't be treated like that again.  They just lost 8 repeat customers."}
{"text":"Restaurants that offer gluten free anything tend to draw me in. Restaurants that offer AMAZING gluten free choices will keep me coming back. Went to Tomato Grill with a friend recently and was delightfully surprised with the amount of choices I was offered as a gluten free vegetarian.   There were so many choices that I can't wait to go back. While I initially suggested our dinner date to happen at Tomato Grill for the gluten free pasta, the Roasted Napoleon (which was an appetizer) sounded so appealing at the last minute I impulsively ordered the Roasted Napoleon and was not disappointed. It was smaller than I anticipated and I think that anyone who eats bigger portion sizes than me, which I think is 90% of the population, would have been disappointed.   The wine selection was a little blah, but the delicious food and the extremely friendly staff made up for it."}
{"text":"Excellent food, nice variety - but most importantly for me, they are very accommodating for food allergies. Friendly service. So nice to find a non-chain gem while traveling."}
{"text":"I ordered the D'Agneses and it was the perfect pasta meal for lunch! Two small pieces of juicy chicken, breaded to a crisp, were accompanied by a side of perfectly al dente pasta. Even more satisfying was the service. Three of us were in and out within 35 minutes during the lunch hour. The waitress was extremely friendly and attentive. Definitely a must visit again!"}
{"text":"I don't understand all of the negative reviews.  I found the food to be good and the service to be even better.  It wasn't that busy early evening so that may make a difference but my experience was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a group of 11 other girls, I appreciated that they took our reservation and were able to accommodate us. I got a buffalo chicken wrap, it was quite delicious. The side that comes with all of their wraps and sandwiches is an antipasto salad, I asked to switch it out and the server said there was no possible way for him to do that. I was dissapointed, is it really that hard to offer multiple side dishes? Other than that, it was a great experience and I will probably go back again."}
{"text":"My boss took me to Tomato Grill for a business lunch. This was my first time at this restaurant and everything was great. Food and service was excellent so I don't really understand the negative reviews from some people."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food! Our appetizer was truly one of the best appetizers we've had in a long time. The ambiance was nice, and the staff were friendly and helpful. A bit on the pricey side, but worth it."}
{"text":"Went here on a date night with my boyfriend. Great atmosphere, and food was tasty but I was surprised main dishes were a la carte. If I wanted anything than a grilled chicken breast with sauce, I had to order it as an additional side. I wish we got a little more for our money."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised!  I wasn't expecting really good food in the middle of pre-fab Hudson, but there it was!  The atmosphere is sleek yet comfortable.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  I would feel comfortable going with a family, or on a date.  I had the Mussles Livornese, consisting of many properly cooked mussles on a bed of pasta covered in an olive, caper and tomato sauce.  The mussles were fresh and tender and the sauce was really vibrant.  Mon cher chou had gnocchi with chicken, which he pronounced good.  He was ready for a nap afterwards!  They also have a nice children's menu.  My daughter had some freshly breaded chicken fingers (not the frozen kind)  and some penne pasta.  It was of a much higher quality than most children's menus."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants around. Love the chicken saltimbacca!  Only complaint is dinner pricing is 50% higher than lunch yet portion size is not that much bigger."}
{"text":"Good service. Decent Italian food. Not the best I've had. But would go back there if in Hudson. Great deserts."}
