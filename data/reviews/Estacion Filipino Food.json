{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Saturday. We got the 2 choices combo for $8.49. It's a turo turo joint. Unlike a Filipino joint in Scarbs, the food is warm when served! They have pretty good selection. Not extensive but what they put out is good quality.   Their sisig is old school style. I  normally like my sisig crunchy and lots of mayo but they balanced the pork parts well! As my husband said, the cuts of the meat is good. You don't go here cause they have \"healthy food\". You go here for the tasty  juicy fat and gravy!   Some nice things I haven't see in awhile- weekend special they have inahaw and fish balls in a stick they can bbq fresh for u. They also have a little grocery store you can buy Filipino snacks. They have a small dine in area but I like that. Keeps the atmosphere fam Filipino style- cozy. Besides, you know you're bringing that food home to feed your fam anyway!   One thing tho- Ate make sure you cook your rice through! I mean my rice today was a little soggy. But it's not gonna stop me from coming back. Found my Filipino turo turo spot in Ajax people!"}
{"text":"Small store but good place to eat when in a rush. It's not a restaurant atmosphere but it's still good place to eat. Food is good and staff are very friendly. This will be my regular store when I crave Filipino food. They serve taho, good bbq pork and other authentic Filipino food. The price is reasonable too.  you can also send money and stuff. Overall it's very very good."}
{"text":"Smaller place, stocked with Filipino snacks and pastries. We came here on a Thursday afternoon and ate the freshest turon and lumpia shanghai we've ever had! So delicious, we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"For the few times that I have gone here the food has been good. My mom loves to order food from here. But my fave item here has to be their halohalo  it's so yummy and a great way to complete your meal! If there is anything you will try here it's that! The rest of the food is ok for me... it's your typical Filipino food spot otherwise."}
