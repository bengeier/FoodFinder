{"text":"At first the place looked like a little hole-in-the-wall but its has its own character and the food was really great. I had the jerk chicken roti and loved it. However my friends had the shrimp roti and felt they were skimping on the shrimp but I was happy so I am not complaining. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I usually really like the food here, but I had the oxtail dinner here last week and was disappointed. The dinner portion of oxtail wasn't very much and the rice was bland. I'll definitely come back, but I hope that this week was just a bad day."}
{"text":"Four Girls is the best in Durham for Roti. My wife and I visit at least twice a week and are greeted by the owner Cathy. She exudes friendliness and warmth. The only thing better is her cooking. Seriously. I am a neophyte to Trini cooking but the roti are outstanding...my fav is curry chicken, my wife eats the veg and my son gets the oxtail. Cathy was so sweet and let my son try the fried shark. He hates fish but loved the shark!!! Parking is a little tricky on the street. Watch out for rush hour. Take a menu so you can call in your order next time -- trust me, there will be a next time. You'll keep going back for more."}
{"text":"Spicy and warm... And that's the owners!  LOL.. Seriously though, very nice people who put out a great product and a terrific price. I've recommended this place to at least 6 people but the problem is they are to tame to try something a bit spicy or stop in downtown whitby.  Do yourself a favour and give them a try, plus they have great soup :)  ( Update - Under new ownership  which is likley a good thing as service/hours had got poor. Have to give it a try again.)"}
{"text":"Stopped into this little shop for some authentic Carib food. Ordered the jerk chicken special for under 6.00$. Friendly lady took my order and it was ready within minutes. Rice and beans and a chicken thigh with a side of potato salad. Nicely done jerk and flavourfull rice. Good size portion for lunch. Didn't leave me stuffed, just satisfied. Would definitely return."}
