{"text":"The worst service ever! We got the breakfast buffet and it was plain, not very hot, and not very good for $12. We waited for 5 minutes to get our drinks, when they tell us that we can't have the mimosas we ordered because they didn't want to open a bottle of champagne for our 2 drinks. So our backup Bloody Mary choice was delivered 5 minutes later with no garnish...we had to steal the water pitcher and refill our own waters! I've been in the service industry for 7 years and I'm pretty lenient about service bc people have bad days, etc. but I have found a place for Restaurant Impossible to film next...and for a Marriott? Super disappointed and sad."}
{"text":"I tend to be quite picky over my coffee and Grace made a GREAT iced latte. On top of that she was very friendly, courteous, and conversational. Rare to find that nowadays, especially in hotel-based coffee shops."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a number of times. Tried a bunch of different omelettes and burgers. The volcano burger was amazing. Their breakfast buffet is delicious also. The bar service was really good, great drink selection.  I must say I was impressed for a hotel restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a hotel bar, so it has per definition hotel bar prices. This makes this place not up to a comparison with other bars in the area - however with that being said, this place is nice. I killed some time in the bar and had great service and decent drinks.   If I ever stay at this Mariott, then I am sure I will come to this bar. For sure."}
{"text":"Food okay but both mornings we went there (mid-breakfast hour) they were out of many items on the buffet (sausage, jam and worst of all, coffee!). Would choose somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"great service but the food could be brought out alittle bit faster. This is my second time ordering a burger and it takes a long time to come out but is cooked to perfection. Staff is wonderful and knew exactly what I wanted as I walked in the door and \"tried\" to explain my order.  Overall great experience but service could be faster."}
{"text":"Nice hamburger, as it should be, for the price. However,I knew the lady who took my order wasn't listening to me. That's why I told her \"no onions\" twice.   I'm picking onions off the burger. Sigh.  Fairness update: when she came back to check on me, and saw the onions on the side of the plate, she said, \"Ugh, they put onions on it anyway,\" brought a napkin, and removed them from the plate (and the table).   Do I guess she heard me, and it's the cook who doesn't pay attention."}
{"text":"This review is just of the bar. My husband and I are staying at the hotel and decided to have a cocktail. We figured what could go wrong? Mistake. The bartender was following a recipe so it's not entirely his fault, but it was pretty awful. We decided to try again another night and picked something easy: margaritas. What could go wrong? Second mistake. It was so sour I couldn't even drink it. Lesson learned. Order a beer or go across the street to the Diamond bar."}
{"text":"Smells Horrible in here and the water tastes disgusting but service and scenery are fantastic. Quesadilla was good not $12 good but good all the same."}
{"text":"4 stars for surprising me with great hotel food. My expectations weren't too high and I ordered some chips and guac to keep it simple and what came out was nachos taken to another level. Spice was just perfect and the guac was the right amount for this size of the plate. Not the best guac, weren't not talking chipotle here but the mix of peppers and cheese was refreshing.  Add that with some local IPA to top it off and I got to say they knocked it out of the park here.  I couldn't wait to finish my meal and I'm eating it as im posting this review. Service was also good too, asked me how I liked it twice to make sure I was satisfied. I just arrived and will be here til Friday, I'll definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"First morning I ordered a burrito and 20 minutes later the server asks how everything is and I say all good just waiting for my burrito.   She forgot my order.   Second morning just thinking it is a slip up.  This time breakfast burrito arrives with no salsa or hot sauce.  Fifteen minutes of trying to get anyone's attention (server had blinders on) I finally went to the bar and caught the server (same one from first morning) and told her the food was now cold an I don't want it.  She wanted to charge me for it so I pointed to the table to show her it was untouched.  She complied.   That is two times I have had an issue during my stay in the hotel at this restaurant.  Cool thing is that the executive chef came out to meet me just before leaving the hotel and apologized on behalf of his staff and advised he would speak to them.  That is why I am not rating this lower than three stars. Rant done - glad the exec chef actually wanted to meet with me.  Will try again next stay."}
{"text":"Came in here because I was too tired to go anywhere else. I am so glad I did. It's a small restaurant that is part of the Marriott. It was very quiet but they had MNF on so all is good.   I ordered the pork loin. It was fantastic. Cooked to order. Served on top of mashed potatoes and then an apple coke slaw on top. The slaw is what made it go over the top. This is a nice little gem in Mesa."}
{"text":"Ate here twice for breakfast and once for dinner while staying at the Marriott.  Breakfast buffet both days was very good and the selection for dinner was okay.  Prices quite reasonable for a hotel restaurant and the food was better than most hotel venues.  The service staff was prompt and helpful.  Recommend."}
{"text":"I ate here this morning and... No one greeted us, or seated us, we didn't have silverware, 30 minutes later we had to flag someone to get our order taken, the hollandaise sauce on my Eggs Benedict was brownish-yellow and had in places congealed into a gelatinous solid (no joke... The SAUCE hung from my fork like a flapping sliver of fatty lunch meat), and it took forever to get our bill.  An hour later we never ate.  I hate to write a bad review and I hope this doesn't come across as an entitled person whining but for its own sake this place needs to make some changes.  It's in a prime location by the hotel and could be a huge success."}
{"text":"The breakfast at Cafe Azul is mediocre. Given the prices they charge, they can do much better. I've dined here several times over the years, and only because of the convenience -it's on the Marriott Mesa campus and I'm always here for a conference.  If you are going to have breakfast here, the buffet is the worst way to go. Order off the menu and you have a better meal. The only good thing about the buffet is the omelette counter.  But if you have a car, I recommend eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stayed at this hotel for work. Let me start off by saying there is nothing else in close proximity to this hotel or this cafe so I think they have relied on this advantage otherwise there would not stay in business. The food is ALRIGHT but the customer service is terrible. The prices are also a little high... $13 breakfast buffet that consists of\"  dried up eggs, bacon/sausage, and some fruit. I ended up skipping breakfast the last couple of days and just having a starbucks drink from the lobby of the hotel."}
{"text":"I don't normally don't even review a hotel restaurant as they are all damn near exactly the same, but the service set this place apart.  Graded on a curve, this place would be 4.5 stars.  Food was satisfactory and the restaurant itself was quite charming.  What would make me want to go back was how wonderful the staff was.  Super attentive and very personable.  As a hotel guest, they made us feel like we were regulars.  If you're in the area, I would definitely stop by for a bite to eat!"}
{"text":"So when I got into the restaurant which was hard to find and was said to be excellent.  So I ordered pork chop meal.  People came in and got their salmon and other food.  45 minutes I left.  I went to diamonds sports bar across the street for a salad."}
{"text":"Hard to believe that this is a hotel bar.  The building is physically separate from the hotel, so perhaps that is one reason.  I chalk it up to hiring.  I was here for three consecutive evenings and Hannah was my bartender.  Hannah is the whole package.  Hard working, quick, funny, smart, competent. I want to hire her.  If you're staying at the Mesa Marriott, don't go any further!"}
