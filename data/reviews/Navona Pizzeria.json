{"text":"We moved here from North York...after trying a few other commercialized ones...googled and found this place a few mins away from our place. Wow! The best pizza ever. Now this is our favourite for pick up or delivery. Thin crust, well done and favourite toppings....yummy! Please donT change anything, keep it going the same way NOVONA PIZZERIA,"}
{"text":"Check out their Canadian! Loaded with pepperoni and bacon. Their white classic is also a must try. Don't mind paying a bit more for quality!
My new favourite pizza joint in Durham Region"}
{"text":"Have been looking for really good pizza in Durham since I moved here a few years back.  Have tried them all in Pickering and Ajax and everything has been just okay (Except Il Fornello which is really good Neapolitan style pizza).

Decided to try places in Whitby and found this via a Google search (4.9 stars).  The pizza here is amazing!  It's a classic New York City style slice; not to thick or thin with the right amount of droop at the tip.  

Also ordered a pound of wings which were very tasty but fatty and not crispy enough as they cook them in the oven instead of a deep fryer.  I'd do the wings again but would ask them to cook them longer.

The place is small with no tables but they do have a counter with stools if you're looking to stop by for a slice.  Their business is mostly take out and delivery.

If you're looking for a classic Italian pizza joint with really great pizza and friendly service, this is the place."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Nice and hot when it arrived. Could have had a few more veggies.
Even our extremely picky cat (who NEVER eats \"people\" food) thought it was delicious."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Durham region!"}
{"text":"We got tired over ordering dominos pizza for mediocre pizza, so we were recommended to try Navonas. The y make best pizza you will get in Durham region, and the nicest family who own it! 

They have great pick-up specials, but are also great for delivery (for those days you don't want to leave the house). We love the wings too! 

Never have been disappointed by this place."}
