{"text":"Been to Zingers twice now.  Both times they did not have the wine I ordered in stock.  Why have wines on a wine list and then not stock them??  Server did not seem knowledgeable about the menu.  The wings we ordered were very dry.  Don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"Assistant manager Janeen (?) was incredibly rude. We had a large group in for a tournament. They were well aware of the scale of the tournament and expected attendance but ill prepared they had one server for 15 at a table. I went in and advised them of our timeline and requested help for our server. After more than 2 1/2 hours most people left with their food in containers. Janeen came out while our server scrambled alone and demanded she pick up ready food. I told her to get available staff out with it. She said there was none. I told her she could do it as she stood there empty handed. She said she wasn't free with incredible disdane. She glared at me and walked away. Food was burnt. Servers are thrown to the wolves and the managing staff is ignorant to customers, even when those customers are offering help and trying to facilitate the process. Avoid this place!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Poor service, walked in at 6:15, didn't get sat down. Waited another 10 minutes, never was seen by a waitress so I went to the bar to grab a menu. The waitress was happy to hand me one, and then stated she would follow me to my booth. Was not seen for another 15 minutes. My girlfriend finally went up to the bar at 640 to grab drinks for our table.   Another customer was complaining about his food taking 50 minutes to arrive (a sandwich and soup for him and his daughters).   Service was terrible and no management to aid with organizing the flow of customers.   The restaurant was less than 50% full.   DO NOT GO!"}
