{"text":"On our first visit my girlfriend and I tried the donair burger, we were very surprised how tasty it was! On our next visit we tried the donairs they were very well seasoned! Most places in Calgary that sell donairs that use meat that is not very well seasoned, this place is an exception. Moe takes pride in what he sells, and that clearly shows.m I haven't tried the chicken shawarma... yet but I plan on it soon. Good thing that he's located in Chinatown and a few blocks from where I live, it's good to know that I don't have to go far when a donair or shawarma craving hits!"}
