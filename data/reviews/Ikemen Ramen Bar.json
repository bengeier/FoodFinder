{"text":"Great food and excellent service. Definitely will go back. Will try their cold sake and some drinks next time. It looks so good"}
{"text":"Been here twice now...great service and really good food. Favourite appies are the tempura mushrooms and roasted brussel sprouts. Their ramen hits the spot with great broth!  If you are craving ramen it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"I had the shio ramen. I liked the broth and the noodles.  Also had the rainbow roll.  Not a bad place to come. I'll be back and try something else next time."}
{"text":"Ikemen's decor is very sparse. Mostly wood, no art hung on the walls or pillows for the benches that makeup the seating on the outer edge of the space.  I personally love it, but it does make the restaurant sound exceptionally busy, even when there was only 20 people including ourselves when we came in for dinner. The menu is simple. Some apps, ramen bowls which are all chicken broth based. Some desserts and a few drinks. I had the roasted tomato seafood ramen and my bf had the miso ramen. I didn't taste much roasted tomato in my dish but the seafood was so fresh, and I prefer having a lighter broth. I find the traditional  pork broth too rich, and hard to finish.  My bf said his ramen was good, nothing out of the ordinary but agreed their ingredients were good quality.  Our sever was pleasant and chatty, making sure we were enjoying our meal."}
{"text":"Brothless Ramen bowl was so great. My friend dragged me here and i really really liked it."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  This place is pleasant to eat at. The staff are friendly and the atmosphere is nice.  Onto the food.  Noodles: needed to boiled slightly longer. They were a little too hard.  Broth (miso): lacking in it's depth and flavour  Pork and Chicken: slightly over cooked and needed a bit more fat to capture the flavour of the broth. Might want to think about slicing the chicken thinner to combat this.  Vegetables: the kale was a nice touch but the celery came in such large pieces that made it hard to eat in harmony with the noodles.  The real winner of this dish was the egg. Top 5 places for me in terms of soft boiled eggs"}
{"text":"Good food, everyone enjoyed their ramen. It's a nice addition to Kensington.   Unfortunately the staff started cleaning up the restaurant even though they were open for another 90 minutes. Nothing worse than dining out while staff stack chairs on tables and sweep floors all around you."}
{"text":"Shio ramen was alright. I found the spicy miso ramen is a little bit better but still isn't the most delicious ramen I have had. Service was fast and good."}
{"text":"Great Ramen! The restaurant is clean and modern with a very welcoming interiors. Not so expensive with a brief menu. Went with a couple of friends for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon and it was quite busy for a weekday!   We shared edamame and chicken Karaage for appetizers. Chicken karaage was just delicious that we literally destroyed the bowl. Lol! Even the dip was so yummy! For mains, we had spicy salmon roll, miso ramen and shio ramen. Salmon roll was one of the best I've ever had in Calgary! Shio ramen (the one I had) was very tasty with perfect flavours. The broth was so rich and flavourful! The presentation was very impressive and the portions were quite generous! Ended our meal with panna cotta for dessert which was an added treat to our already stuffed tummies!   Not to mention, the service was fantastic. Our waitress was so friendly and helpful and always had a smile. Also, the owner came up to us and made sure that we were enjoying our meal!   Overall, a great experience and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Decided to check it out on a whim with my two kids, husband and mom. Service was amazing (thank you Jesse), atmosphere on the patio was great, and most importantly every dish we tried was fantastic. My husband was blown away by how good the Unagi poutine was. I loved my spicy tuna roll, and we all thought the ramen was great. We will definitely be back again. The prices were fair and the food was awesome!"}
{"text":"Overall pretty good ramen and other fusion food with decent pricing.  The staff was very friendly and the restaurant atmosphere was modern and roomy."}
{"text":"I had the Tako Carpaccio & the Miso Ramen w/ added spice (not spicy at all - anyone could have it!) The octopus (tako) was only ok, the sauce was rather lovely but the meat was a little tough. My Ramen was also ok. I have no major complaints. It's pretty unconventional that almost all the ramen have green kale though! Mine did too, you can't taste the kale since the broth was so strong. Aside from adding colour it adds a different texture than the cabbage but there was so little kale I don't know if I liked it or not!   Pros:  Chicken chasiu was delicious!! Open later, excellent for late dinners (post 9pm!) Price is ok (ramen bowls) Service was good  Cons: Just ok, nothing special so far. Kale in ramen bowls didn't add much aside from colour. Noodles don't seem freshly made in house (common issue in Calgary! )"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. I came here before when it first open and it was okay. This will be my second time here and the experience was the same but I was happy to try their happy hour menu. Happy hour is Friday - Sunday from 3pm-6pm, and there are a hand full of items that is worth trying. We ordered chicken chip and spicy tuna roll to start. Chicken chip is deep fried chicken skin with a light spice. Who does not love deep fried chicken skin!? imagine if KFC has a bucket of chicken skin with their secret recipe... WOULD BE AMAZING! It was a good start, but I do wish they had a wedge of lemon with it. Spicy tuna roll was also delicious, but a bit small and not spicy.   Now to the main event... THE RAMEN!  I would say the reason I gave them a 3 star is mostly because their ramen is not your standard ramen. I would say this is more of a Fusion. We ordered the roasted tomatoes seafood and veggi Ramen. The bowl of ramen was big, the soup has tomatoes flavour but a bit bland. The noodle was alright, there was a lot of noodle but it kinda clumped together at the bottom. The topping for seafood consist of a shrimp, scallop, mussel and avocado. The veggi had cabbage (it was raw and hard) and mushroom. Overall, very different experience for ramen and I can see how a lot of people would enjoy this place as the ramens are very different. My friends ordered the green curry soup ramen and they really liked it.  For a group of 12 people the main course took a very long time to come out. Luckily we had some small starters.  I would come back for happy hour again!"}
{"text":"Had the miso ramen started out great with a nice presentation but it tasted a little plain compared to others"}
{"text":"Yummy but not the best ramen I've ever had. I got the tomato seafood ramen, which was good but not mind-blowingly so.  I have no idea where they get their mussels but they are gigantic! The portions are decently sized - there were loads of tomatoes and mushrooms in mine. Service is also good. I think I should have gotten the Shio or the Miso - maybe I just am not a fan of the tomato based ramen."}
{"text":"Such yummy slurpy ramen. Yum yum. Had the Shio Ramen, and I'm no ramen expert but I do know good flavor when I eat it. Broth was lovely and had a good depth of flavor, (perfect for the stupid spring cold I was fighting!) and the noodles were hearty and satisfying with a nice chewiness to them. The only thing not top notch was the pork, rather fatty, as in half of it was fat that I didn't eat. Some people may like that but not my cuppa tea.  Sister had the green curry seafood ramen (had a little taste of the broth myself) and OH MAN. Next time I am definitely getting that. It was quite spicy, the kind of heat that builds as you eat, but it was very well rounded and did I say yum?   Atmosphere was nice as well, lovely place to sit and chat with friends and fam!  Very pleased, and will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Came here second time this year with friends. My friend argued that her ramen was bland and in a way, I agreed. She got the regular miso and I had the tomato-seafood ramen and I was a little disappointed. Their ramen is still on the salty side for reasons unknown. We did love the chicken chips. I also had a chance to try their panna cotta which was divine. Sadly, it is no longer my favourite ramen bar :(. Will come back for the chicken chips solely though don't get me wrong!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way through to Banff. He recommended the miso ramen with cheese curds, at first I thought it sounded weird but decided to try it angst and it was phenomenal. Deff check it out if you're in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Ramen, ramen, ramen. Ramen all day, every day.   After watching an episode of Chef's Table featuring ramen, my sisters and I were craving ramen like there was no tomorrow so we decided to check Ikemen out.   The restaurant was pretty empty when we met around lunch time, I'm guessing it's more of a dinner spot? Either way, we found a table and service was fast.   I got the Shio Ramen, my one sister got the Roasted Tomato Seafood Ramen, and my other sister got the Roasted Tomato Veggie Ramen.  From a traditional standpoint, my Shio ramen was the best. It was SO good I ate every last drop. But the broth of the Roasted Tomato Seafood Ramen...that was heaven.  The broths were delicious and each ramen bowl was filled, they don't skimp here.   Delicious!"}
{"text":"Ramen and broth were ok. Nothing really exciting. The one thing of the menu that I really really liked was the deep fried chicken skin.  Sounds weird but tastes really good."}
{"text":"07/22/2017  Pleasant place to eat, the staff are very kind here!  Food is delicious! I do reccomend the roasted tomato veggie ramen! It was really good!  I would definitely go back again :)"}
{"text":"Giving you 5 stars because you are playing Bassnectar. And there is nothing better than listening to Bassnectar while eating some delicious Ramen."}
{"text":"Server knowledge: 4.5 Server attitude: 4 Food quality: 4.5 Food Portion: 3.5 Ambience: 4.5 Price: 4  I would definitely go back again. This great restaurant is in the heart of Kensington and makes for a perfect night out. Go for the Ramen, it's one of the best in town!"}
{"text":"Had the mushroom ramen and there were lots of mushrooms (various kinds too). Also got a flying lotus; it was refreshing. The ramen was great but i wouldn't get the mushroom again. Also, I wish I added the special spicy seasoning earlier than I did.   Service was excellent and felt skilled. Overall a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Saturday we decided to try a ramen place. So we went to Ikemen Ramen Bar in Kensington. It was quite busy during the lunch time  on saturday of course but didn't have to wait at all. I ordered tom yum seafood ramen in coconut milk, and green curry seafood ramen. It had one big prawn, big pieces of scallops and mussel. rarely do I ever get scallops this size in other seafood dishes. Their broth was very rich, delicious and overall I was quite impressed. This was the first time I have had a seafood ramen. If you love ramen this is a place you definitely need to check out."}
{"text":"When I heard that there was a ramen restaurant opening up in Kensington earlier this summer, I was beyond excited. The minimalist design, advertisements and promise of tasty, delicious ramen drove me to even mark down the opening night on my calendar. My first visit was not a disappointment. The ramen is fantastically tasteful. The gyoza and other appetizers are absolutely mouthwatering and sometimes even filling on their own. I have returned many times since my first visit, just to expand and explore their ever-growing menu.  The take-out option is perfect for when you are on the run, and the service when dining-in is relatively fast as well. When ordering takeout, Ikemen gives you the broth and the noodles in separate containers, and a heat pad underneath that kept my ramen warm for at least an hour!  First date, quick meal or lazy Sunday brunch, this is the place to do it.  Ps, try the Cold Honey Green Tea and be prepared to share! Huge bottle that is hard to finish on your own, but it's also too good to not let other people try."}
{"text":"Throughly enjoyed my supper here! We sat on the lovely patio and tasted the seafood ramen, rainbow roll and Gyoza. The Gyoza was exceptional! Fresh ingredients in the sushi and extremely flavourful ramen. The only thing I would change is to have a few more veggies in the soup but was very appreciative of the service and friendliness of the staff! Thank you for a lovely experience Ikemen!"}
{"text":"My friends and I love this place however we would argue never to stray from the basic ramens (miso and shio) just because they do tend to not be as great for a higher price the tomato broth isn't very good and leaves you feeling a little sick, if you are going for the ramen I really recommend the Shio is it my personal favourite! The broth is salty where as the miso has more of a sweet broth to it! They are both excellent! The atmosphere it lovely! The seats are not super comfortable as it is all wood. but I do recommend this place! It is great for groups and the service is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and noodle was okay.  I thought the soup needed to be hotter but the taste of broth was good."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for Ramen it was awesome, great selection and the atmosphere is super laid back. Tuna sashimi was superb. If you are in Kensington and want to have a bite to eat, check this place out!!"}
{"text":"So far so good.  Looking forward to trying their other dishes!  Chicken chips...3.5 stars.  This could easily have been a 5 star dish but was over seasoned.  The chicken skins are perfectly fried and tasted ALMOST heavenly...the choice of seasoning couldn't be more perfect but was too overpowering.  If you love KFC then you'll love this dish, but ask to have the skins tossed in only half the normal seasoning amount. ;)  Truffle Mushrooms...4 stars. Almost perfect.  Nice size pieces of fried king oyster mushrooms with an addictive seasoning. Losing 1 star to being slightly greasy...execution was not up to par with your typical veggie tempura.  A side of dipping sauce, like spicy mayo, would've been a nice compliment to balance out all the fried goodness.  Miso Ramen (spicy)...4 stars.  A very well prepared dish; you can certainly taste the effort.  For a chicken-based broth, it's quite flavorful if not a tad salty, but the ramen, veggies and protein helps to balance it out.  The pork belly is nice and thick and braised to where it's just tender. It lacked some flavor but, as mentioned, went well with the broth.  The sous-vide egg is lightly poached and, when broken, adds another layer of flavor to the rich broth.  And of course the medallion slices of baked chicken didn't go unnoticed.  Green Curry Seafood Ramen...5 stars.  Excellent broth!  It's very reminiscent of Thai tum yum soup but not as sharp, making consumption very smooth and enjoyable. The seafood could not have been more perfectly prepared, as well.  The mussel and scallop are super tender but the giant prawn was simply amazing...it melts in your mouth like butter (much like crawfish)!  I added pork belly to my soup simply cause I LOVE pork belly...it was even better and more flavorful this time around (need to work on consistency).  My only gripe about this seafood dish is the lack of seafood...could use another mussel and scallop."}
{"text":"I decided to try out Ikemen yesterday and here's what I ordered:  Salmon Sashimi (3 pcs) - $6  Besides the obvious ramen, Ikemen has other eats such as Japanese treats and of course - sushi/sashimi.  This was on their specials chalkboard and the fact that I always want raw fish, I decided to try out the sashimi here.  Not bad.  Nicely cut, nicely cooled and fresh.  Bluefin Negi-toro Roll - $7  This is my favorite hosomaki.  The toro was velvety and smooth with a decent amount of chopped negi, but what surprised me was that there was wasabi in the roll! As you know I'm quite the sushi purist, I prefer that wasabi is added directly to my sushi as that is the traditional way.   The kick from the wasabi was quite pleasant - it was just enough and not overpowering.  However, I think the staff should mention to you that's how they serve it - I have friends who don't care for wasabi and would send this back if they didn't know ahead of time.  Rainbow Roll - $15  Instead of the pollock mixture inside, there's julienne cucumber, really creamy avocado and tobiko inside the roll, then topped with an assortment of fish.  This was pretty decent but I felt that it was a touch pricey for what it is.  Shio Ramen - $11.95  Being also quite the ramen purist, I went with the most basic flavour - shio.  The broth here at Ikemen is different than your usual pork - it is made with chicken and you can certainly taste the difference.  It's not as salty but has a cleaner taste, although personally I prefer the pork stock.  However, this one is good too! Hubby definitely enjoyed the miso.  As for the noodles, it has the similar texture as the packaged ones - somewhat thick, chewy and bouncy and it was cooked nicely.  In terms of toppings, you get a sous vide poached egg, one thick slice of pork belly and a couple slices of chicken roulade type thing - all of the meat was seasoned very nicely.  Yuzu Panna Cotta - $6  I thought the yuzu flavor in the panna cotta was a bit weak but the dessert itself was nicely made.  I like the frozen berries on top - sure gave it a nice contrast! I was actually hoping to try the sea urchin ice cream but it was sadly sold out.  That's ok, it means I have to come back again, right?  Overall it was a pretty good lunch and I wouldn't hesitate to return! Service was pretty good - food came out at a decent pace as it wasn't busy and I love how spacious the restaurant is.  Next time I would come back and try their Japanese eats - like their unagi poutine!"}
{"text":"Lovely ramen- shio ramen! Forgot to take a pic unfortunately. The price is reasonable to. Service is fast and the ambiance is nice and quiet."}
{"text":"Ramen snobbery has crept up in Calgary and it's about time we address it. Well it's about time I address mine, because owning a copy of Tampopo (google it) doesn't give me the right to assume the role of ramen expert. But ramen in Calgary is different from the ramen experience in Japan. Even though I've never been there I'm sure of it. One reason is that Japanese ramen is still all about getting a hearty and quicky meal, followed by taste. In Calgary, when one simply doesn't want to bother with cooking dinner, there are a list options and Ramen is in the bottom of that list. In terms of price, availability, and time, I'd take a bowl of Pho' and Congee over Ramen in this city.  One might ask, what does this have to do with Ikemen? Plenty, because Ikemen follows the same path as Goro, Shiki/Shikiji, and other restaurants that serve ramen in Calgary. To eat a bowl of ramen means a fancy dinner out, which affects the characteristics of the ramen bowl. Instead of aiming to be the heartiest, cheapest, and quickest meal, it's now become a battle of broth flavour and it's toppings. If Ikemen were to be rated in the category of \"fancy dining ramen\" I think they'd be right up there. The noodles were cooked to the right consistency, the roast pork executed well, but the broth could have done without the overpowering garlic. Overall it's a bowl worth finishing. I couldn't get enough of their sous vide eggs and their char siu chicken was just as delicious as the pork. What entices me for a 2nd/3rd visit were their non-traditional ramen, concocted to mainly please vegetarian appetites.  I'm giving every star for Ikemen's imaginative menu. The appetizers alone are worth the visit! we over-ordered in our last visit and I regret nothing because it was worth the hit on the wallet and the indigestion that followed. The fried mushroom with truffle oil was salty but balanced with a light seasoning of truffle oil. I also had a sea bream special, which is a rare item in Calgary sushi menus, and it was refreshing and fresh. But the must have dish at Ikemen: the Unagi poutine. The cheese, the fries, the sweet sauce, the healthy dose of unagi...good gawd...this was a drunk man's fantasy, a failed dieter's dirty obsession, and every Crossfitter's dirty little secret.  Our service was great and the dining room was interesting. However here were a few things to nitpick: 1. our sushi roll was packed with too much cream cheese, a little less would be perfect. 2. See my comment on the garlic overpowered broth. 3. The sea bream didn't seem like it was served just as sea bream, it may have been spiced a little but men and my gf couldn't figure out with what, it would have been nice to have special iteams like that served as is, perhaps we should have request a sashimi option.  I'll def be back for the tomato ramen because I'm a sucker for Japanese Italian fusion and a second helping of the unagi poutine."}
{"text":"Very pleased that this ramen bar has replaced the average Indian restaurant that used to be here. I actually didn't get the ramen, we tried the sushi and a bunch of sides. We sat on the patio which is a pretty decent size for Kensington. We got the spicy tuna roll which was really very good (with large slices of jalepeno peppers on top) and the california roll which was just average. The gyoza was a bit watery and not as good as other places in the city. The real stars were the chicken thigh starter (seriously one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten!) and their homemade iced tea. I got the citrus iced tea and it was lovely and delicate. It also comes in a giant bottle and is fairly pricey (but not for how much you get) so this is a good thing to split with others. They also did not have a large drink selection when I was there, just 2 beers. I was expecting some fun cocktails so I hope they sort this out soon. All in all I thought it was a pretty good experience for a brand new restaurant with some hits and some misses. I really hope they expand their drink menu soon though!"}
{"text":"I was going to wait until I could visit in person but the food is just so good! I had delivery from skip the dishes and was skeptical about having ramen delivered but man was I pleasantly surprised. The roasted tomato mushroom ramen with cheese curds was SO GOOD. And the chicken chips are too die for! I'm very much looking forward to going there in person soon!!"}
{"text":"I've had ramen in three different places in Calgary now and Ikemen has been my favourite place so far. It didn't blow me away but I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a very simple restaurant with not much effort in decoration. Love their ramen. They use chicken broth for their ramen which is a plus point for us.  Very clean and tasty base.  Also tried their Tom Yum Ramen. It was little spicy and tangy at the same. Really good if you want lot of flavor in your ramen. They put good amount of seafood in there.  They have good food on their menu. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"So happy we got in for dinner tonight! Started w the Gyoza and edamame appetizers then we each ordered our own ramen bowls - I got the miso Classic and Ed got the spicy seafood - both so good! The service here is so friendly too! Definitely worth a stop next time you're in Kensignton!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty ramen. The tomato seafood soup was delicious and very \"umame.\"  Boyfriend had the shio ramen (another solid choice). We'll definitely come again! Hope they expand their list of flavours."}
{"text":"This is a cool little ramen joint with some interesting menu options. I stopped by on a Sunday evening at around 5:30pm, and seating was plentiful both inside and out on their cute little patio. Service was friendly and prompt.   Rather than go for the more exotic tomato soup ramen, I decided to have a traditional Shio ramen with a side of chicken chips. The chips are essentially fried chicken skins, and are very generously portioned for the price. They're fun to eat and not overly oily, but the seasoning is quite simple (maybe some chicken salt and pepper), and towards the end, it was a bit too salty to finish an entire portion on my own.  The ramen itself was not mind-blowing, but respectable. The use of kale was an interesting twist that I was dubious about, but it effectively cut through the salty broth. I wish they provided more than one piece because the broth was quite salty, approaching the threshold of unpleasantness for my palate, but not quite. Otherwise, the broth was good, but not overly complex. The meat included a slice of nicely cooked pork chashu, and two pieces of chicken chashu. Overall, I'd consider the quantity moderate to generous. The noodles were fine. Again, nothing special, and potentially a little too al dente for some, but I enjoyed them.   I have to give special mention to the egg. It's been mentioned in other comments, but holy cow, that egg. It was the best egg I've ever had in ramen. Even my favourite ramen places botch this up, with obviously re-heated eggs that are unpleasantly lukewarm in the centre. Not this place. This egg was soft boiled perfectly, with parts of the white still semi-liquid, and yet not grossly undercooked. It literally melted in my mouth. Mixed with the salty broth, it was a brief moment of heaven.   Overall, prices were very reasonable, running at less than $25 for an excellent meal. This place is worth becoming a regular, and I will ask for 1 or 2 more eggs with my next order."}
{"text":"I really don't understand all the 4 and 5 star reviews here.  The ramen at Ikemen is fine, not great.  I ordered the miso ramen.  The broth was made from chicken rather than the traditional pork broth (and I generally love chicken broth ramen!) but it was not that flavourful and the ramen didn't have that much \"stuff\" in it.  They ran out of pork the day I went and gave me chicken instead, which was fine, but there wasn't enough greens in the ramen and the noodles were overcooked rather than soft and chewy.    They do have other unique items on the menu and a chalkboard with daily specials which I haven't tried but it sure sounds good!"}
{"text":"I have been hearing a lot about noodle houses opening in Calgary and I finally got a chance to go to one.  I can truly say that I just don't like roman noodles, I think that I ate to much raw as a child. But besides that the mushroom broth was fantastic and the seafood tom yum broth was full of flavor, I did find it a tad salty.   Good environment really relaxing. Staff seem a little uninterested.  I would stay away from the green teat cream brulèe it was like they over boiled the tea and burnt the leaves.   Maybe next time I will have the sushi."}
{"text":"Finally some great ramen in Kensington. We dined with the kids and they really enjoyed the tuscan rolls and the mango rolls.   My wife and I loved the green curry seafood ramen. We sat on the patio with the kids and the service was excellent.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had high hopes considering the raving reviews. Although the service was good, it soon went downhill after our ramen arrived. She ordered the shio and I ordered the miso. First taste of the broth was amazingly... Salty. It tasted like someone used all the miso paste, I kept drinking water to combat the salt. Considering the broth is supposed to be cooked for 8+ hours, the amount of miso used ruined it. The noodles were average, not bad but not fancy either. As for the ingredients, given that a bowl is $12.95, I expected more than a sliver of pork belly and two small pieces of chicken. Then there is the kale and the soft boiled egg that was too runny... I assume they're either attempting a fusion twist or someone decided to make it as weird as possible. Second to last was the background music.. Playing odd jazz renditions of Titanium and various other songs that just made it worse. Lastly, is the payment method; during the entire time we were there not once was there a mention that the handheld machine wasn't working meaning they couldn't take debit card and they only had a credit card swipe system inside the restaurant. It would have been nice to know in the *beginning* so I could have grabbed cash because I only use debit.  Luckily my friend had her credit card on her so she paid for me. But what if she wasn't there? Would that meal be free given that no one bothered to inform us of the malfunction? I doubt it. Bottom line, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place has a Modern environment interior, then the servers are warm and friendly the moment you step in. Food here is fresh and comfortable for any days, even if it is warm, hot sunny day or even a icky soggy cold day.   There is only one long communal table, so if you don't want to share a table I would recommend come hear early."}
{"text":"Great spot for ramen in Calgary. One of the few places that serves cold ramen all year around.  Got the Char Sui cold ramen. Delicious. We also order the Uni ice cream but they didn't have enough for a full order so they gave us what they had left for free as a sampler, which ended up being the perfect amount for us."}
{"text":"I'm slowly making my way to all the ramen places in Calgary. Seems like there are so many new ones opening up, it's hard to keep up. I've tried the main players so I decided to check out something new - Ikemen Ramen Bar. It's been open for a couple months now (opened May 2015) and what sets them apart from their competitors is that they specialize in using chicken (paitan) broth.  It was a rainy, dreary Friday evening when I got dropped off so the patio wasn't set up. Seems like every place in Calgary has a patio! Ikemen's can fit 28 people which is quite spacious for a ramen joint. The inside is sleek, modern and spacious with a ramen bar set up both front and back of the house for solo diners. Ramen places are the beeeeest when it's just you. I grabbed a seat up front so I could people watch.  The menu is short and to the point. They have two standard ramen options (shio and miso) but the rest are very \"fusion\" (green curry, roasted tomato and mushroom). Those ones are pricey ($13.95 to $14.95)! They also have a cold ramen, which sounds pretty appetizing. The waitresses were friendly and attentive for the most part but I had a bit of trouble getting their attention at the end so that I could pay and leave. Other than that, service was good.  - Tuna poke ($8.00) - you have the option of salmon or tuna poke. I went with the latter. This isn't your Hawaiian style poke (probably one of my favourite things to eat in the world) but if you don't think about that, it was nicely done. The creamy avocado, red onions and nori complemented the tuna well. - Miso ramen ($11.95) - miso, soft boiled egg, cabbage, garlic chips, sesame seed, kale and char siu. I went with the option to make my broth spicy ($1.00 extra) but it didn't add much. For me, the broth was pretty mundane and was lacking any real depth and complexity. The noodles had a nice chewy bite to them but my favourite item was the chicken. Incredibly tender, well seasoned and flavourful. I could and would eat the chicken on it's own.  Verdict? With stiff competition from their fellow Kensington ramen neighbours (Muku and Menyatai), Ikemen is in a tough boat. They're worth a try if you're a ramen lover but if you're any bit of a ramen purists/traditionalist like I am, the contest isn't close. The quality, consistency and price of Muku and Menyatai are hands down better."}
{"text":"Ramen was great! Probably the best one I've tried so far! The atmosphere is simple but pleasant. Service was great, and food was delicious.  The portion is quite big. Prices are fairly reasonable.  Totally recommend and will come again!"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when I entered Ikemen was the moist wooden stench that filled the entire restaurant. It smelled and felt damp in there, like the entire restaurant was once flooded and then after the incident, they just left the restaurant as is. It was not an appetizing smell.  The unique feature of the ramen here compared to the other well-known ramen shops in Calgary is that Ikemen bowls are chicken broth based instead of the usual pork broth that Calgarians are used to. Although interesting to try, I still prefer the pork broth over the chicken broth, as there is more flavour. I had the Shio ramen and opted for the additional spice with their yuzu-gosho paste. The yuzu-gosho paste wasn't spicy at all, nor did it add any flavour. The kale didn't fit in with the ramen. However, I must give credit where it's due - their sous-vide egg was amazing. It was my favourite part of the ramen bowl. I probably should've ordered a side of the egg without the ramen.  Despite the fact that the ramen wasn't the best, what saved the food experience was the Unagi Poutine and the Tako Carpaccio. The unagi pieces were generously portioned and the gravy mixed with Japanese mayo was what made the dish. The tako carpaccio was an appetizing starter that I would highly recommend. The ginger (albeit faint) yuzu dressing  was very refreshing and complimented the octopus slices very well.  Our server was very attentive, but might have been TOO attentive. When I asked him what he recommends as the restaurant's popular dish, he named almost everything on the menu. As a result, I relied on Yelp comments to help make my decisions (Thanks Yelp!). Throughout the night, he was always there the second a dish went empty. He even started to clean up my friend's bowl while I was still eating. This is a big no-no for me! When servers start to clean up the table while someone else is still finishing their entree, it gives off the impression that they are rushing me to leave. I felt like the server had no ill intention, but it was just something that removed from my experience here.  I'm glad I tried this place out, but I don't know how often I'll be back as there are other ramen favourites I have in this city. I would come back for the appetizer, but not so sure about the ramen."}
{"text":"I'm writing an updated review today as I've been to Ikemen recently, and the experience was slightly less glowing. While I still enjoyed the ramen overall, the broth for the Shio Ramen was exceedingly salty - to the point where I'd have to dilute it by half with water to enjoy it.   Hopefully this was a one-off because I really like this place!"}
{"text":"The spicy salmon roll was a fantastic way to start a dinner. Excellent ramen as well. Will be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the ramen at this restaurant because it's made with a chicken broth rather then a pork broth. We had the spicy tuna roll as a starter and it was very tasty and flavourful and the piece of jalapeno on top gave it a nice kick. We tried the Roasted Tomato seafood ramen, tom yum seafood ramen and the mushroom ramen (supposed to be soy-free).  Everything tasted really good but the diner that's allergic to soy still had an upset stomach. We weren't that careful when we were ordering so it definitely could have been our fault."}
{"text":"This is my husband and my go to Raman bar. The restaurant is relatively large and there is always a spot to sit! The staff are incredibly attentive and quick to take your order and bring you your food! The restaurant is clean and in the heart of Kensington which means you can spend some time before or after your visit wandering around some amazing local shops ... the candy store is just around the corner! I've tried quite a few things on the menu but my absolute favourite is the Miso Raman... so much so that as I'm typing this I'm starting to crave it! Guess I know where I'll be headed this week!"}
{"text":"Very cute little place with great decor. It was nice to see a menu with both sushi and ramen options. I tried the shiitake mushroom ramen. Great presentation and also good ramen. Great and fast service. I would definitely go back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times and love the curry seafood ramen with the slightly spicy broth which is not curry flavoured as most would think. Don't let the curry dissuade you from trying. Most people think Indian curry flavour when they hear the word curry but you won't get that here. Soup bowl is huge and can be shared if you are a small eater or add appetizers to your meal. Broth was not too salty which is a deal breaker for me and very clean- not greasy/ slick and not cloudy from overboiling.   For appies, tried the king mushrooms which were a bit bland but cooked to perfection. The chicken skin was well seasoned but had a few really salty spots. Maybe better tossing would even out the distribution of the seasoning? Chicken karaage was the bomb with the garlic aioli.  Have also tried a few sushi items which were very tasty.  I have yet to try dessert as I'm usually stuffed from the soup!!!  It's a great family place that is sparsely decorated and good for kids. It can get quite noisy when full but I highly recommend this as the best ramen place in town."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this joint however on this night I'm a bit disappointed. The service was very efficient and the spicy tuna roll was delicious - clearly very fresh tuna and the jalapeño on top was a nice touch. The ramen however was lacking flavour, luke warm and the mushrooms were almost raw and unsalted. To bad:("}
{"text":"Review: happy hour/dinner.  We came here for a special birthday and were early enough to try their happy hour before the main event.  Bottomline: their attempt at creating a ramen fusion shop was somewhat of a hit, but needed extra to hit bull's eye. Happy hour is great.  Atmosphere: Kensington is a trendy area and this restaurant is no exception. Decorated in more or less Izakaya style, the restaurant has a nice casual trendy ambience inside. The restaurant also has a patio but it was closed for the season. Service was great and attentive. They let us bring in our own birthday cake and provided all the settings.  Food: for happy hour, we ordered the salmon poke, spicy tuna roll, and chicken chips. The salmon poke was well balanced with the condiments but was a bit fishy. The chicken chips were essentially deep fried chicken skin, which sounds delicious but somehow they managed to make it impossibly bland. The spicy tuna roll was great. When one thinks about spicy tuna rolls, it's common to expect an inside out roll with \"red tuna paste\" inside. Ikemen puts a nice spin to the dish by putting the mashed tuna on the outside with a little slice of Jalapeno pepper on each one. Very cool.  For the main meal, we ordered the tom yum seafood ramen and the mushroom ramen with chai sui. The tom yum seafood ramen tasted exactly how it sounds. Portions were a bit off with only a few seafood items to compliment a large bowl of ramen. The mushroom ramen was the opposite. There were so many mushrooms that they made the flavor quite monotone and it overpowered the ramen.  Value: the prices for happy hour were very good. I would definitely come back for it. The price for the ramen was just okay."}
{"text":"I found that it was not as good as other ramen places that I have tried. I got the miso soup and it lacked depth and needed more girth. I found that it did not exceed my expectations. The meat in it was not how I expected it to be. I would never go back. There are better places."}
{"text":"3.5 stars in my opinion. I'm originally from Vancouver and recently moved to Calgary so I'm spoiled when it comes to Japanese food. But still, ikemen was not bad!  The service was quick and friendly. Great location in kensington. The restaurant decor is simple but there is a pleasant atmosphere. Their menu had some delicious sounding options but since it was my first time, I ordered a generic Miso Ramen with some added spice, as well as some tea and sake.   The noodles had a nice chewiness but were slightly too aldente for me. The broth was lighter than what I'm used to for miso ramen but was fairly clean tasting and not too oily. Still, the broth was missing a lot of complexity. The pork belly had great melt in your mouth texture but could have been seared a bit more to help the flavour stand  out from the broth. The chicken was very tender and added some great umami flavourful. Altogether it was decent, but could have used a bit more colour and fresh veggies to play off the broth it had.  I'll be back to try a couple other dishes, but if I'd also like to see what the rest of Calgary has to offer in the form of ramen first. Prices were very reasonable for Calgary."}
{"text":"A very good spot for ramen in Calgary and very modern too. They have a unique soups and appetizers that you won't find in other ramen places and honestly the appetizers alone are worth coming for and the same for desserts.   Speaking of which the ramen and soups are very good and clear and you don't come out feeling bad after eating the noodles or drinking the soup. My personal favourite is the tom yum ramen.  Would gladly recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Got the miso and whatever the other one was right after it on the ramen menu - they are both the same with different broth (one miso, the other sea salt).  The ramen comes with egg, chicken, pork, and of course the noodles.  The portions were pretty darn good for the price, if in the area and hungry, go for it!"}
{"text":"We had the Green Curry Seafood Ramen the Spicy Miso Ramen and loved both dishes. The lighter chicken broth made for a less coma like Ramen experience. We recommend trying it but if you go, eat outside, the inside smells like a church basement."}
