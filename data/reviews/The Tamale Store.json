{"text":"I go to the farmers market in old town on Saturdays to get my tamales for the week. They are SO good! I like that there is no lard used. Very clean taste, not salty, the meat is seasoned perfectly. My husband, daughter & I are big fans!"}
{"text":"The Tamale Store makes delicious tamales!  I love that they clearly label which are vegetarian and vegan, and they have a wide variety of choices. 

You can call the store and place an order, then pick up your order at many of the various farmers markets in the valley.  If you go to the Scottsdale Farmer's Market, make sure to get there early because they sell out of the good ones quickly!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love these tamales! You cant go wrong with any of them. For over a year we searched for whose tamales we tried at a farmers market. Then a friend told me that is had to be the tamale stores because that is who she gets hers threw and were the same cream cheese tamales we were talking about. Thank Heavens for her!!! We have a stock pile in our freezers! They are always so fresh, the taste is unlike any others, and i never was a tamale person until now!!! Every chance we get we find out what market they are at and restock our freezer. We eat them atleast once a week :) AMAZING!!!! You must try them!"}
{"text":"I had forgotten how BOMB this place was! Right next to my new temporary place of business too!!! 
Green Corn and Cream Cheese! And don't be scared away by the prices! They are twice the size of a typical tamale.....rolled in 2 corn husks instead of one! gasp emoticon"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Not only do they have great tamales, but their customer service is phenomenal. I buy a dozen every few weeks. I can't stay away! Perfect for lunch--quick and easy to heat up in microwave!"}
{"text":"even though getting the tamales is sometimes a pain, because they sell out so quickly...they are absolutely worth the wait. They are moist, delicious and made from fresh ingredients. So good, that they even serve them at blue agave.

try the green chile and cream cheese and the red chile pork. Delish."}
{"text":"These tamales are friggen amazing! Thin, delicious masa overstuffed with moist and savory filling! Could eat em for breakfast,  lunch and dinner they're so good!"}
{"text":"Just the best tasting tamales I have found. FYI, check some of the local farmers markets for their booths. Makes it more convenient for me anyway."}
{"text":"The tamales are absolutely delish! I do wish however the would increase the varities they prepare. They have no seafood tamales I think of about a dozen more varities that would be tasty. Also wish they would be bigger. 

I placed an order for a dozen tamales and when I got there my order wasnt ready. The store's decor could use a little make-over and they need to make the place and the work a bit more presentable. They need to polish up a bit. Other than that the food was good. Whenever I have a tamale craving I will go there but there is some room for improvement."}
{"text":"I had some serious cravings for good tamales, and this is THE place to go.  They have a wide assortment to choose from, and many are still warm from their steamer.  I freeze them when I get home and steam them for 35 minutes and they come out just as fresh and tasty as the ones I get from the store.  The staff is friendly as well.  It's a little out of my way, location wise, but well worth the drive.  Also... Do t forget to pick up a jar of the red and green tamale sauce.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food but I've never really been a fan of tamales. Now I get it! These things are absolutely delicious. 
My wife called me up after placing an order and told me I had until 4:00 to pick them up from their tiny storefront on Cave Creek road. Later that night we steamed them according to some directions we found on the web. Great diner !  My first 5 star Yelp.
Lastly, this is not a restaurant, but as the name implies, a store. You pick them up frozen, or sometimes I hear they have some hot. But plan to take these home, or to a friends house and serve them."}
{"text":"Until very recently, I didn't know that Tamales are traditionally a Christmas food! 

Well, now you can have THE MOST DELICIOUS CHRISTMAS WHENEVER YOU WANT!

The Tamale Store makes the best tamales I've ever had. Not to mention their staff is friendly. Can you say \"yay\"?

If you've had tamales before and were unimpressed, you probably had a bad one. I've had many bad tamales in the indefatigable quest of good ones, and this store delivers some high quality stuff. 

The one idiosyncrasy of the store is this is definitely a STORE and not a restaurant. There is no seating area to eat, and most of their offerings are frozen for later enjoyment. You can, however, inquire what they have hot if you're hungry right when you go. Careful! When they're hot, they are HOT!"}
{"text":"The people here are very nice and helpful.  They are happy to make suggestions or talk about the new flavor they have made.  My favorites are:  Pork Red Chile, Chicken Green Chile, Green Corn and Cream Cheese.  I also really like the Pi√±a Colada dessert tamale more than I had anticipated.  Get a dozen.  They are frozen, wrapped in paper, and then two are placed in a sealed plastic bag.  I keep them in the freezer for a quick dinner or snack idea and they last well.  I have microwaved them six months after I bought them and they still taste great!"}
{"text":"I bought the red chili pork at the farmers market and they are delicious, I can't wait
to try some of the other flavors."}
{"text":"Delicious tamales. Have eaten them fresh and from frozen at home. Zero complaints. I would highly recommend this place! Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Went to the Phoenix Farmer's Market and had some of their delicious morsels.  The Masa is made with great attention.  Most Tamale casing is bland and tasteless.  This stuff had some flavor which complimented the many fillings.  I can't wait to get some more."}
{"text":"Literally the best tamales I have ever stuffed in my face (no joke). I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"What a gem! Looked it up while visiting my grandfather who lives within a mile and he had never been there! Now he has their menu posted on his fridge.

You can order tamales by the 2s, dozen, or 20? I believe. They are frozen, but are fresh and ready to be heated for a quick meal or a party. There are about 25 different kinds and they even had seasonal pumpkin ones. They have tons of vegetarian options. 

Lucky for us, they do sell a couple fresh tamales. You can't each inside, but they will give you a fork and plate and you can eat on the bench outside or take on your picnic. We had chicken green chili, pork red chili, corn and cream cheese and chipotle corn. The corn and cream cheese was amazing and the chicken verde was moist and flavorful. Recommending it to anyone who comes to visit grandpa from now on!"}
{"text":"PRO: Their store is a mile from my door. Stuuu-pendous!
CON: I wasn't aware of them until now. Reee-gretable!"}
{"text":"I grabbed a few fresh and a bunch of frozen before my flight back to Chicago and they are all delicious. The seasonal pumpkin pie ones are amazing- lots of flavor, not overly sweet. I also loved the pork tamales. 
I'll definitely be back on my next trip to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The absolute best tamale I've ever had.  I just enjoyed the pork and green chile.  The pork was so tender and juicy, and the masa delicious.  Cannot wait to try the others!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best tamales we have ever had, by far.  We enjoyed the red pork and chicken mole.  They were very generously sized.  Two each left us stuffed.  Service was friendly as well."}
{"text":"The tamales are decent...not as good as mi amigo's wife makes them, but the prices are way too high.  $2 a piece or $20 a dozen is the highest in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wow !! This place is amazing - the best I've ever had !! Worth the drive .. Pins colada is the best :)"}
{"text":"Love the Tamale Store even though their hours drive me crazy!

I've tried pretty much all the tamales- my favorite are the Jack and poblano peppers, the green chili chicken and red beef. So tasty and delicious and so stuff full of ingredients. The BF likes the Vegan tamales the most but enjoys all the other ones we buy. 

The tamales are so delicious and so easy to reheat, I've never had an issue with reheating them in the microwave or steamed in a pot. We've even taken them camping and steamed them; which was amazing. I haven't tried their dessert tamales or their salsas, but I look forward to it!

They are not open at the actually store during the weekends as they are off at multiple farmer's market, which I often forget and have to wait to refill our tamale stock until the following Tuesday. Or I get down in time to the farmers market downtown and clean them out of the ones I like best!"}
{"text":"I have actually never been to the store - however, my boyfriend and I frequent the Phoenix Open Market specifically for these tamales.

He's a vegetarian and I'm pescatarian - when it comes to tamales, we are almost always super limited in our options. We had TONS of options and every single one we tried was amazing. We actually didn't use a steamer - we just heated them up in the microwave and they turned out just as good as the ones we purchased hot at the stand!

We've tried:

Cream Cheese and Mushroom
Green Corn Cream Cheese
Bean and Cheese

They were all AMAZING. I really don't love frozen foods/quick meals, but I fell in love with these so much that we'd often make side dishes to go with the tamales as our main entree.

The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because they never seemed to have any vegan options at the stand, and my boyfriend was pretty interested in trying some of those out."}
{"text":"The Tamale Store makes some of the best tamales around!  Finally got a chance to try them at the local farmers market and have been hooked since.  With guests coming for Christmas, I decided to purchase some tamales for some holiday snacking.  We got a variety of flavors and all were marvelous.  We particularly enjoyed the pork red chili and the chicken green chili.  I love how much meat they pack into these babies as well as the soft masa, which is full of flavor.

The Tamale Store is surely my go-to place for a fabulously convenient and tasty tamale!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I am sort of a tamale aficionado. My step mother makes REAL authentic tamales from her own family recipe. It is very unusual that I find one I like outside of her house. But I tried a sample of these at Momma's organic market one saturday morning, and I a HOOKED!! SOOO many to choose from . I brought home an assortment of half a dozed, plus I ate one there. They are the best anywhere! Many unusual and traditional combos. Cream cheese in a tamale?! Who da thunk? 
Sweet green corn is my favorite! 
Try them, you will be so glad you did!"}
{"text":"When my grandma came to visit in April she wanted tamales and I was wondering where I was going to get that during the non tamale season and after a quick search I found this place. The tamales were so good and everyone in my family where raving about it. I have no idea how I forgot about this place because I started craving tamales and my husband reminded me that The Tamale Store was nearby and he got me the chicken and green chile and the beef ones and they are as good as they get. If you want good tamales go here, yes they are pricier than other places but they're big and satisfying. You won't find tamales like this at other stores."}
{"text":"I tried their samples at the Westgate farmers' market, and they were good. Not fantastic, not unusual. But good. I think I would have to try some more to really make a truly educated review.  

FYI, they have a holiday special, where if you buy 2 dozen, you get a 1/2 dozen sweet tamales for free. Rates are $20 a dozen, $10 a half, and $2 each."}
{"text":"This past July I finally hit up the Tamale Store booth at the Ahwatukee Farmer's Market.  I was initially a bit off put by the prices, but pickt up a half dozen tamales to bring home.  Over the past six months I've tried nearly every variety

The masa alone is fantastic.  Moist with a nice texture.  I could just eat their tamales with no fillings, but mmm the filings . . . 

The Beef Red Chili, Pork Red Chili are great.  I'd like a little more heat, but that's just me.

The Pork Green Chili is also very good.  

The Chicken Mole was ok, but I really don't like chicken in Mexican food.  The mole didn't seem to add anything good to the mix

The Roasted Poblano Chilies and Jack Cheese was ok.  Heavy on the cheese and light on the poblanos . . . if it had been the other way around I'd have liked it a lot more.

Lastly, hate to be a gringo, but my favorite might be the Tex Mex with seasoned ground beef and cheese.  Fantastic.

So yeah, give'em a shot"}
{"text":"Amazing people. Brilliant classic and unexpected combinations. Worth the effort to call ahead and order. Worth waiting in line when it's busy. Worth finding this hidden gem. You might even get a warm batch - and yes, I ate them in the car before getting home. Salsa is darn good. T-Shirts are fun. Seasonal flavors are tasty. All in all a great find. It's the tamale reinvented!"}
{"text":"I am very fond of tamales. Since I live in the Northwest part of the year, I'm always in search of good tamales. Before purchasing tamales from The Tamale Store I looked at fellow yelper's reviews. Some people say $3 for a tamale is expensive. Some say not enough filling and too much masa. Yes there are pro's and cons to these tamales.
In my opinion The Tamale Store are good tamales. There not the best I've ever had but since I can't get tamales for a long stretch of the time they will do.
My go to tamales here are the Chicken Mole, Chicken Green Chile,Cilantro Black Bean,Bean and Cheese. I tried there pork tamales and they were a little to dry for me.
I'll make several trips to the Tamale Store until I my stay here in AZ is up."}
{"text":"We went to the Phoenix Public Market just to look around since we've never gone to a farmer's market. All kinds of awesome things there, but I think the best find was the stand the Tamale Store was set up in. Not only do they not use lard in their tamales AND not only do they have vegetarian tamales, but they also have vegan tamales! Just had our first ones for supper - I got the vegan southwest tamales - with a dollop of tofutti sour cream & salsa and they are the best tamales I've ever had! The only problem I had was little bits of the paper stuck to the tamale, but it wasn't inconvenient enough to dock a star."}
{"text":"I first discovered these delicious tamales at the Farmers Market on Cactus and the 51.
   After trying the Chicken and Green Chili tamale, I was hooked. I now regularly buy tamales each week when I'm at the farmers market. 
   The chicken chipotle is hands down my favorite tamale they make! Perfect amount of spice and is great when you top it with goat cheese. 
  These tamales are a taste of heaven! Not to mention guilt & gluten free!"}
{"text":"I was inspired by Michael's Review of the Day yesterday to write on Tamale Store, because quite frankly I haven't had any lately because we just exited the official Mexican tamale season AKA, the three months where every hispanic relative in the state makes gazillions of dryish to OK tamales and you have to eat them because you are related and they think theirs are the best on the planet, so you better tell them they are or they are going to smack you on the back of the head- season of good cheer.

But back to the task at hand. Tamale store. We were introduced to them at the begining of last year on a day trip up to Payson, where we noticed they had just started up a Farmer's Market in the Chili's parking lot on Highway as you enter town. Heck yes, we decided to stop. 

Lots of great stuff there, you should definitely check it out, but most notably were the tamales! I claim tamale tasting expertise based on the 27 years of consumption,and yes these are Fantastic. 

I became a rabid fan of their green corn, red beef, chicken chipotle. And I will never pass up any opportunity to buy these scrumptious moist delicacies.

Beside the amazing tamales, the staff is INCREDIBLE. They taste out their tamales to everyone that wants some, and bags up the orders with a true awesome love for what they do. They are very helpful and informative for the tamale retarded and find the flavor that you are going to love. 

They have veggie and vegan options which are great. And they sell out fast. The girl told me later in the season on another visit, that they always sell out in Payson, so if you go to this market, head to this booth early. They drive up from Cave Creek, so what they have for that day is IT.

Don't pass this place up.

Oh, P.S. In case you were wondering....way WAY better than anything my family made this \"tamale season\"  (luckily none of them have any clue what Yelp means)"}
{"text":"Great tamales best we've ever had.. We got the green pork and green corn and cream cheese I am so eager to try there different flavors we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"NOW $35 bucks a dozen??!!  That's 3 bucks a tamal!  They better be adding some truffles in those bad boys.  This place has definitely let the reviews go to their heads.  Their tamales are actually really good.  Great flavors, good portion, excellent masa but let's keep it real here folks.

A tamale consists of mostly masa which is very inexpensive and these bad boys are STUFFED with masa.  I understand making tamales is very labor intensive and making good tamales is an art but I am not hanging these on my walls and there is no shortage of tamale makers in AZ.

These owners are whipping that cash cow hard!  Good for them I suppose.  A sucker is born everyday right?   If you think these tamales are affordable you must either be filthy rich or have absolutely no clue on how much it costs to make a tamale.  

The Tamale Store certainly makes good tamales but after their 25% raise on already high price vs cost product I for one will not be back."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I did not eat at the restaurant but I purchased his tamales at a Farmer's market.. My neighbor kept on raving about them and so I figured alright, I'll bite.  They are really good and a bit addicting! She said he doesn't use lard and I couldn't taste any.  I'm not big on Mexican food or spicy primarily because they tend to make me sick but not this one.  I had the chicken and green chilli and they were DEELISH, not spicy at all.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We just happened to be eating down the street and stopped in here to check this little place out. It is a small shop where you order up front and they bring out what you need. We were even offered some samples of their delicious Tamales and some of their seasonal Pumpkin Bites.

The sample of the day was their famous Red Chli Pork Tamale and it came out hot and ready to eat. The lady working in back was very excited to see us and truly wanted us to enjoy what they were doing. She explained all the different flavors that they sell and told us both what was most popular with the customers and what she preferred as well.

We decided to get a half dozen and did a mix and match type of order. Most of them come in a two pack so we went with three different types. Red Chili Pork, Poblano and Jack Cheese and a Green Corn and Cream Cheese. They are already cooked and frozen and all you have to do is pop then in the microwave and a two pack is ready in five minutes.

Wow ... wow and wow! So easy and so delicious. We all agreed that these were some of the best tamales that we have ever eaten. The ingredients and the flavors were spectacular and they all had a freshness that can not be explained. How can something that was frozen taste so good?

This place is definitely on my new list of places to obsess on and will ultimately have to try every freaking flavor they can create. They even have a nice selection of Salsas that are presented on the side wall.

Come on over here and get your Tamale groove going on. They will even make you custom batches just by asking nicely. Too many flavors and combinations to write home about. OH YEAH BABY!

5 STARS"}
{"text":"Love love these tamales, I have bought tamales from here three times. They are the biggest tamales I've ever seen. The ingredients are what separates them from other tamales. They are a bit pricy but they are very large and worth the price. My husband and I can only eat two per meal, so I usually buy half a dozen. I have tried the Tex mex and love it but my favorite is the pork green chili."}
{"text":"I've unfortunately never been to this location as it is a bit far for me but I am frequent customer of their booth at the Scottsdale farmer's market. Probably my favorite thing to purchase!

Caroline is always so friendly and clearly has a passion for their family business. It's quite difficult to find vegetarian tamales, forget about vegan options. The Tamale Store provides a wide array of both. No lard here! They're surprisingly affordable, easy to steam (they're frozen) and oh-so-yummy. 

I love all the veggie options but my fave are the black bean and cilantro tamales (vegan). Looking forward to visiting the actual store if I'm even in their neck of the woods."}
{"text":"I hit up the Tamale Stores table at the Old Town Scottsdale Farmer's Market on Saturday, where the two brother owners were giving away free samples of their warm corn treats. They have standard beef, pork and chicken tamales as well as a number of sweet ones including blueberry and pumpkin. 

I bought a packet of two cheese and mushroom tamales that i had today for lunch. all i have to say is mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. gooey cheesy goodness! I haven't been to the store...yet. But it seems inevitable that i'll get myself some hot, sweet pumpkiny tamales for thanksgiving."}
{"text":"Incredible tamales. You have to bring them home to warm but it is so worth it. I've become addicted to the green chicken chile tamale. I buy a few at a time and it's perfect to pull them out of the freezer whenever I'm hungry. They heat up so quickly and taste far better than most frozen (or fresh) alternatives. I loved the vibe of the store as well. $7 for 2 which is not bad at all for being half a pound and filled with a lot of meat. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Anticipating a grueling swim team practice in the evening, I went here yesterday afternoon to get a tasty, stick-to-the-ribs lunch. I got two beef red chili tamales and a pumpkin tamale. The beef tamales were scrumptious, as expected. The pumpkin tamale, which I ordered out of curiosity, was excellent! It was rich and just sweet enough to provide a pleasant counterpoint to the savory beef tamales without being dessert-sweet. And for 6 bucks, that lunch sustained me through the afternoon and through the rigorous physical activity of the evening. As I said in my previous review, the Tamale Store is far from where I live, but now more than ever I'm convinced that it's well worth the drive. And I'm planning to get frozen tamales next time so I'll be well-stocked with these tasty treats."}
{"text":"We first encountered these wonderful tamales at the Scottsdale Farmer's market. The Tamale Store has the best tamales I've tasted since I have lived in Phoenix, and I am no rookie to Mexican food. I have literally purchased dozens of these and transported them to California in an ice chest for Christmas Eve dinner. Their masa is lard free, so I have no clue how they get the masa so light and flavorful. They usually have about 20 different kinds, including vegan and dessert tamales. And the people here are so nice! You can call in your order, but try to get there by 4:30 - they keep early hours. Pick up a menu.....you won't be able to decide, so just buy whatever sounds good. They freeze well until you are ready to make a sauce, toss a salad, and call a few friends."}
{"text":"Happy people with a focus on really good quality tamales! Would come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Yummy! We got a dozen for a dinner and everyone loved them!  The red chili pork are SO good."}
{"text":"I ordered my annual Holiday tamale order from here this year. I was very happy I found this spot. The tamales are huge and they have tons of varieties. I loved how I could submit my order right online. The quality and service is on point."}
{"text":"*Customer Service is Everything* I went in today to try out some tamales I have heard nothing but Good about and I must say all 3 employees we faced were So welcoming to me and my kiddos and nothing but Smiles! They were just so Genuine! With that being said it makes me want to come back again soon!! 
:) Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"My quest for the perfect tamale is over. I've found it at The Tamale Store, and I'm here to Yelp about it.

The tamales have a perfect masa (outter corn dough, not to be confused with the corn husk) to filling ratio. Often times I find that there is too much masa, but these achieve a perfect balance in each bite. The masa is moist but not mushy and absolutely scrumptious, but not too salty. Did I mention they were moist? Usually, tamales have me reaching for a glass of water to help ease the dryness down my throat, but these were perfection!

I had the green chile pork and chicken mole tamales, both of which were evenly shredded and seasoned well. I honestly can't see how you could go wrong with either of these, so if you're like me and fear a disappointing meal when it comes to a food favorite, try these first and then venture out in future visits. And you WILL be back for future visits :)"}
{"text":"This place is quickly becoming my secret obsession!  Love me these tamales!! The chicken mole is an absolute must when they have it."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 10 stars! I love tamales, BUT I am very picky that they not be too dry.  These tamales are AMAZING.  I've tried most of the tamales, but look forward to getting there and seeing which ones are fresh.  So far my favorite are the Red Beef, but I love all of them.  I prefer that they are all take out because I like that they focus only on tamales.  if they became a restaurant, I imagine they would start adding all kinds of other items.  Tamales are difficult to find AND good ones are even harder to find.  I am grateful to YELP for turning me on to this great place."}
{"text":"Great Authentic Tamales!  A friend discovered this place and spread the word in the Phoenix Vegan community that they actually make vegan and vegetarian tamales! They are very tasty and come in many varieties. They make your order fast and the staff are very friendly! Good food, Good price!"}
{"text":"Tamales sounded like a perfect late-morning breakfast as we wandered through the Old Town Scottsdale Farmers Market. The list of frozen tamales for purchase at the Tamale Store stand was impressively long, with meat and vegetarian options. The hot, ready-to-eat choices included chipotle chicken and mushroom with cream cheese. 

The chicken tamal(e) was my favorite, with large pieces of meat and a smoky sauce tucked inside the moist masa. The mushroom one was also good, but not as flavorful. Considering how time-consuming it is to make tamales (my sister-in-law spends hours on them), if there were a Tamale Store in my town, I'd definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"I drive by the tamale store everyday but never stopped because I was told they were expensive for tamales. There is not many food establishments in the area so I broke down and tried them. The first time I went there I got the tex-mex-tamales. They were very good and I like the fact that they don't use lard. That is one reason I didn't like tamales before. So, I went there again this morning. I bought the pork tamale w/red sauce. I have not eaten them yet so am not sure how good they are. 

On the down side, I did take a glance into the kitchen area when I walked in. It did not appear to be very clean:tongs on the floor and some garbage and used gloves. Not sure about the \"dirt factor\". I didn't have that much time to look."}
{"text":"On a cold day in December we made our trek to the market in hopes of finding the best tamales in the southwest. What we found was an empty stall. My hopes were crushed! How would I treat my out of town holiday guests to this southwest tradition with NO tamales?! Knowing that usually The Tamale Store is usually closed on Saturday, I wasn't giving up.. I called and happily found that they were open until 2pm on this particular weekend in December. Away we drove in hopes that THE best tamales would still be available. Yes, we could have gone somewhere else, but these were worth the trouble. We haven't found other tamales to knock our socks off the way these do. 
Upon arriving at the brick & mortar store on Cave Creek, the line looped out the door and the length of the building with people licking their chops just like me wanting these amazing tamales! An hour in line and we got the last of them: Green Chile Chicken & Chicken Mole Tamales would be on our table! I felt bad for the long line after us who were vocal in their disappointment. We could have waited longer for the newest batch that was literally being made by hand as we waited; the flavors were changed as they ran out and made more. Talk about fresh! But we were happy with what was left. 
Usually one would order at the counter and likely get a sample or two but this was holiday time! The tamales here are some of the best I've had in the southwest, hands down. The Tamale Store offers so many flavors of chicken , pork , vegetarian ( green corn and cream cheese ; poblano and cheese or bean and cheese ) , beef , ground beef , Tex Mex and at times unique flavors like Red Velvet and Cream Cheese or Pumpkin particularly around the holidays. These sell out fast! I was sad to not get any because that was my hope and I missed out last year too! I have usually sampled the tamales at public markets in the valley. You can purchase most of them in packs of two at the markets and they are frozen or fresh. The fact they are frozen doesn't deter from the amazing flavor of these hand made tamales. I steam them in my crock pot for a couple of hours and they taste fresh. I don't have a favorite; I've tried pretty much all of them and my lesson is to stock up. I don't like running out as they are a favorite in our home and they aren't as bad for you on a health note as some tamales as The Tamale Store uses no lard and I also love that they are hand made and best of all.. local! The meat inside is fresh and not greasy. Amazing flavor til the last bite. 
You can pre-order and after two holidays of worrying about no Tamale Store tamales. While at the brick & mortar store we also grabbed two salsas. Delicious , spicy and fresh! Who knew that I would move to Arizona and have to have such a treat stocked at all times ... Well, I didn't until I had The Tamale Store tamales! Find them at public markets around the valley or at their store in Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"The Tamale Store sets up a booth at the Farmers Market in Anthem - I drive down just to get my Tamale Fix (TF). Pork with Green Chilies - my favorite. Very, very addicting. Even better with their Salsa Verde on top - killer. Not cheap - $33/Dozen - but these are big, very high quality tamales. And they are packaged in Pairs - making it easy to only thaw what you want."}
{"text":"So good!!! The Bean & Cheese tamale with their green salsa is my favorite. I buy them frozen, perfect for keeping on hand when I do not feel like cooking. They go straight from freezer to steamer, done in 40 minutes. They are microwaveable, though I haven't tried reheating them that way. When buying a dozen, you can mix flavors, but minimum 2 of each. Someone different has helped me every time I've been, and everyone has been very nice."}
{"text":"These tamales are one of the best things I have ever ate. OMG, they are worth the price. The owner, is so beautiful and has excellent customer service, I will definitely be back to try every flavor!

My fav is the corn and cream cheese, chicken.. Don't forget to check in to yelp for $2.00 off"}
{"text":"Got my Christmas tamales here, first time ordering, not the last!

Sampled many types, all were good, all had their own merrits.  EVERYONE's favorite was the green chili chicken tamales, for me a close second were the chicken mole followed by the green chili pork and the poblana chilis and Monterey Jack.  

My biggest complaint about most tamales is the excruciating lack of filling, but not from The Tamale Store!  These are big tamales with big filling.  Trust me and get your tamales here."}
{"text":"Tamales so good make you wanna race back for more when your done. FRANK discovered this tamales delight while shopping at The Scottsdale Saturday market. At 9 am there's an actual line people are standing in to get the treats. You know something amazing is happening, and it was in the form of a tamale!  

I'm a pork with green verde sauce kinda person so I grabbed one and as I rolled back the steaming corn husk I stabbed more fork into pure tamale heaven. Plenty of moist meaty pork inside the masa with green chili sauce cooked to perfection splashed over the top ( yumm ) but it doesn't overshadow the tamale itself. 

I urge you to skip breakfast and grab a few of these baby's cause there delicious!"}
{"text":"Their tamales are great!  We loved the chicken with green Chile, the pork with red chili, and the chicken mole.  They were limited on the different varieties available because I went right before Christmas, but I will definitely go back and try all the others!"}
{"text":"Convinced a friend who doesnt like tamales to try this place and she ended up getting a 1/2 dozen to go, so definitely recommend. Tried red chili pork and cilantro black bean and both were delicious."}
{"text":"I've tasted plenty of tamales always searching for a great tasting one because I don't know how to make tamales myself. I almost gave up looking for a good tasting tamale's that  is until I came across \"The Tamale Store\", what a great find!!!!!! Every bite was soooo goooood\"! The taste couldn't get any better. These tamales are everything a great tamale should be: soft, moist, corny, and packed full of great tasting ingredients. There's no skimping on these tamale's what a selection to choose from, the Tamale Store offers meat, vegan, vegetarian, and sweet tamales. You have to try the chicken with green chili, rice and cheese, incredible!!!!"}
{"text":"I made a special trip down to the Fountain Hills farmers market today in search of these tamales. Low & behold they were there and they did not disappoint! I got the Pork red chili tamales and they were amazing!! Great flavor but not too hot, just right. I will be back to try more flavors!!"}
{"text":"These people literally saved Christmas - ok, maybe just Christmas Eve, and maybe just dinner, but it was a really big deal, nonetheless.  

First, the critical information: the tamales are delicious!!  They're not cheap ($28/dozen), which is totally fair because they're made without lard and taste incredible.  We had a dozen green corn chiles and just ate the last ones last night - yum!  Can't wait to taste their other flavors!!

Next, a compliment on availability: through a series of schedule changes and misunderstandings, our Christmas Eve tamale order fell through and I had to scramble at the last minute.  This place was open on Christmas Eve day, and the lovely people who run it were pleasant when answering the phone, and truly friendly and welcoming to all of us who lined up right out the door. Genuinely, my family and I are grateful!!"}
{"text":"Best tamales in Phoenix. So many varieties fresh and frozen. These tamales will not disappoint you because they are large, moist and have a perfect amount of filling to mask ratio. Try them for yourself they give free samples you will definitely purchase a dozen at least if not 3."}
{"text":"Being raise on Tamales i have had many in my lifetime and some were Good Bad and Ugly  But these tamales Pork Green Chili and Pork Red Chili are the BEST i have EVER had.. The Masa was amazing the taste was so soft sweet and oh so Perfect.. Melts in your Mouth.. This is the only place i will ever get Tamales.. Thank You The Tamale Shop  For  your TLC and the Best Tamales Ive ever had  I will be back and back and back and try many of your other choices"}
{"text":"Amazing tamales.  I have tried four or five flavors. The place is all family run and they are all very nice and accommodating.  Good news, they're getting ready to open a specialty restaurant. I am excited for them and me.  They deserve much success"}
{"text":"Best tamales I've ever had. I try to keep some in my freezer at all times. They offer vegan and vegetarian options and the tamales are a generous size. They are made in small batches so the quality never suffers even at this busy time of year. The people that work there are patient and kind and take their time with each customer. If you can't get to the store try finding them at AJs or Whole Foods."}
{"text":"Wow,  by far the best tamales I've had to date. 
  My stepfather said that his tamale recipe came from his grandmother's recipe and she had cooked for Pancho Villa. I thought they were pretty good until I moved to San Diego. 
  A co-worker brought in some tamales his mom had made that were so good, she would make large batches and sell them to over 30 people who worked at the company. 
  Pancho. Villa would have shot my great step grandma if the tamale store had been around in those days!!! 
  I wouldn't have minded either, my ex-stepfather a real piece of work lol.  And the Tamale Store makes my recipe look and taste like a tamale kak uh.. 
  I would highly, highly, recommend a trip here, but don't be surprised it's not a sit down restaurant.  It's a take-out place and they have freshly frozen or what's hot options of tamales. Whichever you choose you definitely won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I finally tried TTS. While the service was top notch the price and the tamale were just ok. 

I ordered #6 for $19. That is a little steep but after seeing the size I was ok with it... but the quality of the tamale was lacking. The beef was good, good flavor but the masa was doughy and way too much. There was a solid 2x2 block at the back/bottom of it. 

The green tamales were good, not near as large not near as much meat and I was just over the whole thing when I ate the green one. 

The same day I bought these my wife bought a dozen from costco...green chilie and cheese. she paid less and the family ate those first."}
{"text":"This review is for their tamales only.  I haven't been to this location, I bought mine at the Phoenix Public Market.

OMG these are some of the best tamales I've ever had!!  I've tried the beef with red chile, the green chile chicken, the chicken chipotle and green chile corn cream cheese.  There was plenty of filling and you could even tell by looking at it, what it was filled with.  The taste was amazing, and spiced nicely.  They heat in 2 minutes in the microwave (I left them in the paper wrapper and corn husk) and they steamed inside to a perfect moist and hot tamale for your eating pleasure.  These tamales are exactly the way all tamales should be!

I am happy to know I can buy these at the Mesa Farmers Market on Fridays without having to go all the way downtown.  You can be sure I'll stock up again!"}
{"text":"Frozen tamales, get them to go and steam them at home.  They're pretty good, but wish they were available at the grocery because it's a pain to drive halfway across town on a weekday to pick em up."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh just ok. Sorry. 6 tamales for $20 with tax. I expected an amazing experience. I was very disappointed. The price point does not match what is offered. The beef was so chewy and hard to swallow. I will be returning to Tamales in Mesa where the price is right and the tamales are really good! Sorry I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Got 2 of their chicken chipotle tamales at the Ahwatukee Farmers Market. I should have listen to the guy and got more!! 
They were delicious! The masa was fluffy not too dry or creamy and it had flavor to it. The filling was just right spicy and made with white meat, no fat. 
Next week I'll get a dozen... Or two, who knows?"}
{"text":"Great tamales.  Chicken mole is a must have."}
{"text":"The place is very small but it's staffed with very energetic people. They have a massive list of tamales that can be pre-ordered(highly recommended) or take your chances with ordering what their making when you arrive. We arrived at 3pm on the Monday before X-Mas and there were 20+people waiting for tamales. We finally got a chance to order and we were lucky enough to get a half dozen of red pork and half dozen green chicken. They were fresh out of the steamer. They are big and fresh and delicious! If you love tamales, I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Heard many good things about this small shop from  yelpers and finally was able to get a chance to try the homemade tamales ! Since I did go on Christmas weekend the selection was limited, but I think I was in luck getting the red chili pork tamales! I was not disappointed at all. This had to have been the best and I mean the best tamales I have ever tasted in my existence of being a NY transplant! Yes I have been here for 20 years but who's counting ! Anyhow once the holidays are over I'm excited to try out there other tamales on the menu!"}
{"text":"We love the tamales from The Tamale store!! We purchased half a dozen at our nearby farmers market (they go to farmers markets around Phoenix, see their website) while family was in town. This was our second exposure to The Tamale Store's tastey, tastey tamales. Being vegetarian, they have delicious choices (my fav - hands down - is the beans and cheese tamale) and at least one vegan option as well. Easy to steam and when they're gone, you'll be sad because they are THAT good."}
{"text":"Best tamales I've ever had. I tried the chicken and green chile, the chicken was tender, juicy, full of flavor, and was all white meat. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"At first glance, I really thought the prices seemed a bit high for tamales, but then i realized how HUGE the tamales are.  You really only need one per person.  I am from Chicago and we ordered a bunch of frozen tamales to bring home.  So far I've only tried the poblano and cheese ones and they we delicious!  They aren't spicy (which i was hoping for) but they were cheesy and good!  I really like the home made feel of the tamale store and the guy that helped us out was a super nice guy.  Next time were in AZ we'll definitely be making a stop at the new tamale store."}
{"text":"Great experience.  I ordered mini tamales for a party with a short (2 day) turn around.  The service was perfect and the tamales were delicious.  $12/dozen for the minis.  I picked them up hot.  They stayed hot for about 2 hours (I wrapped the tray in towels to keep before serving.) Everyone loved them.  The masa was had a nice corn taste, and did not have lard so my vegetarian guests were able to eat them.   The mini tamales are a great size for a party as you can eat a couple and try different versions.  

Thanks, Tamale Store!"}
{"text":"Best tamales ever!!! I'm vegetarian and came across their bean and cheese tamales at Whole Foods. When we read that they were 10 minutes away. I stopped in! Everyone was super nice, and the wait for fresh tamales was quick! I'm obsessed and in so much joy that they don't use lard in the tamales, and that they've got 5+ vegetarian options and even a few vegan options! I've tried every vegetarian/vegan option they offer, and the bean and cheese are by far my favorite, but I would highly recommend any flavor!!!! I can't wait until they open their restaurant this year- my job is around the corner and I'll be a frequent diner!"}
{"text":"Service is great, the front desk is very attentive and friendly. I tried the red chili chicken tamale. The meat was delicious! I just wish the masa was less mushy and a bit more firm. I will try their green corn and cream cheese next time."}
{"text":"Growing up in a Hispanic family I have consumed very many tamales in my lifetime. I have had big ones, small ones, dry ones.. You get the idea. I've never had the perfect tamale until.. Now. The search is over, folks. Let me just tell you that these tamales are like manna from Heaven. So many options to choose from-whether you are vegetarian, vegan or gluten free there is something for everyone. My personal favorite is the black bean cilantro.

I salute you Tamale Store."}
{"text":"The Tamale Store made me a believer!  Not having grown up in the Valley, I wasn't exposed to tamales until recently, and I must say my initial impressions were not too favorable. I was ready to chalk up tamales under the category of ethnic food that is more about tradition than taste.  Most of the tamales I'd tasted were bland, mealy affairs of corn skimpily 'stuffed' with under seasons fillings.  Then one day, upon a suggestion from a friend,  I tried a Tamale from the Tamale Store at their kiosk at the Downtown Phoenix Public Market.  Now I'm a believer!  

Unlike the tamales sold at most other places in the Valley, the Tamale Store's version consist of the perfectly cooked masa that is fluffy AND flavorful, overflowing with scrumptious fillings. They carry a full range of tamales, from the traditional (beef, green chile, pork, etc) to unique vegetarian combos ( green corn and cream cheese, spinach and mushroom) to delicious dessert choices (blueberry, pumpkin...) 

I haven't been to the retail store yet, but they are the highlight of my regular trips to the Downtown Phoenix Public Market. I usually have one to eat on the spot, and take a dozen frozen ones to enjoy at home."}
{"text":"These are easily the best tamales I have EVER had.  I used to live in Phoenix and could have them any time I want.  But now that I am in Oregon I don't get to enjoy them and believe me I miss them!"}
{"text":"Yummy is all I can say.   My husband had never really experienced great tamales.   He had the usual dried out bland tamale, not at The TAMALE STORE.   It was the Saturday before Christmas and they were basically sold out.   We bought the 3 options they had, Red (hot) pork, Green Pork and the green corn.   WOW, the green corn are now going to be a favorite.   We used our rice cooker to steam them and made rice at the same time.   AMAZING.   

We can't wait to go back and get more flavors.    Thank you so much!!!"}
{"text":"Bought some today at the Gilbert Farmers market. I had to try one as soon as I got home and they are delicious. Four minutes in the microwave and boom they are hot and fresh. Love that every bite had the filling, nothing worse then  the filling only being in the very center. got 1/2 dozen of green chili pork and chicken chipotle."}
{"text":"I'd like to rate this place higher but my 1st experience was a let down .. 1st of all don't go in there expecting to order anything off the menu , cause you can't . You can only order what they have cooked at the time ... which in theory makes sense , since you can't just whip up a tamale , but still a let down 1st time walking in and seeing a menu with delicious sounding tamales only to be told you can't order them .  So maybe if I'm craving tamales again I'll call ahead and see what they have to offer before driving down.. and if so I will update my review . 
Pricing : 2 tamales for 7$ !! Seems steep !! So like I said , I will have to craving them to pay that price ."}
{"text":"To compare with another tamale place that I used to frequent, this place wins based on the tamales. 

Their tamales here are good, the masa is perfect texture and isn't too dry. They sell a few of them hot during any given day. They sell all of theirs frozen everyday, pending not getting sold out.

Only thing which is a little upsetting, is that it isn't a restaurant. There is only a small sitting area to wait. If you get your food you get it to go. Also, it's tamales only, no real sides to get with your food. I wish they had more, but for what they are 5 stars. I love some good tamales.

Their hours are reminiscent of them not being a restaurant."}
{"text":"The green chili tamales are amazing! My husband brought home a bunch of them and they reheat in the microwave so easily and never lost flavor. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Voted best by New Times, which is reason to pause. Bland tamales if we've ever had some. Way too much melding of maza and filling.  And, skimpy filling to say the least. Poblano jack cheese were the best. B+. The seasonal pumpkin dessert were foul tasting and fully textured like baby food. If want vegetarian tamales perhaps endure them. If you want truly great tamales, go to one of Phoenix's mainstay shops. New Times should be ashamed."}
{"text":"I love me some tamales from The Tamale Store.  They are absolutely delicious.  We always go and pick up a couple dozen, some to eat while we are here and some to take home to Chicago.  Our favorites are Green Corn and Cream Cheese, Poblano and Cheese, and Chicken and Green Chile.  Don't get me wrong, we love them all but those are our must haves!!  The family that owns the store are very friendly and helpful.  We return time and time again and always get great food!  I wasn't really a tamale fan before having them at The Tamale Store.  Go give them a try, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"We ran into the Tamale Store purveyors at the Citadelle Market a few weeks back.  In the fall/halloween spirit, we decided to get two of their pumpkin tamales (frozen).  The next night for a nice dessert, we prepared them in the steamer.  I don't know what I was expected, but, wow, they sure were good.  Went back the next week, and decided to get something a little more savory (in addition to a couple more pumpkin ones).  We settled on two ground beef/cheese and two green chili chicken.  Again, we prepared them in the steamer from frozen.  And again, they were quite good, I cleaned my plate and part of my wife's as well.  Definitely will be getting more tamales from there, they are so good.

The only thing keeping them from a five star review is that in the two pack of ground beef tamales, there was one ground beef and one shredded meat (probably beef, but quite possibly pork).  Hopefully it was just a one time mistake, a lot of people (like me!) don't eat pork for one reason or another..."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian tamales in town! The poblano and cheese along with the cream cheese and green corn are fantastic! The prices are slightly more than your average tamale place, but I don't mind spending a little more when the ingredients are way better :)"}
{"text":"awesome customer service and knowledge of the tamale world. Im a out of towner and I was looking for the authentic tamale feel. As a chicagoan its hard to find authentic south western food that is worthy of praise. The chicken green chile and the chipotle chicken are
the bomb!! they make it in the store and freeze them for you to take home enjoy with the family. The helpings are huge and the customer service is bigger. Im definitely a fan of the store if your in the phoenix area its a must eat!"}
{"text":"Awesome, friendly people and really great tamales! Would be five stars if I could eat there, as everything is take and bake."}
{"text":"Great menu -- vegan, vegetarian, meat and dessert options!  Family-owned and very friendly. Expensive, but worth it."}
{"text":"Great tamales; deplorable attention to business. Saturday, February 25th I checked on line to be sure Store was open and hours. On line indicated open 10:00 till 3:00. Having a lengthy drive I decided to call to confirm hours. I got a recording that confirmed the hours 10:00 till 3:00. After nearly an hours drive I arrived to a welcoming OPEN sign in the window. Wrong, wrong and wrong: on line, telephone and window sign all wrong. CLOSED! I like their tamales but have little regard for businesses that don't pay attention to running their business."}
{"text":"This business makes me mad every time. I've called 4 different times placed orders 3 times and the 4 was told they had plenty of ALL their tamales. Drove all they way their on my way home from Scottsdale to laveen. And they are ALWAYS closed early even though I had called an hour earlier and placed an order. And the time I made it in before they randomly close shop after being told they had plenty of ALL their tamales every item I asked for they were out of."}
{"text":"I am so glad this business sells Tamales at the Downtown Public Market because there's no way I am driving to Cave Creek just to buy them. 
Don't get me wrong. They are good and delicious, but it's too far of a drive. I'm so pleased that you can call and order ahead and pick them up at the Downtown Public Market. The vegetarian and vegan options are awesome.
I've had their Mushroom, Corn and Spinach Tamales and the Polano Chile and Cheese which are both equally scrumptious.
But buyer beware, one tamale may not be enough and you will be severely tempted to buy a few more."}
{"text":"Great place to pick up frozen tamales via a 6 pack.  2 tamales is enough for a meal, so gives you 3 meals. 

Tamales are delicious and well out together rare to find in commercially made tamales."}
{"text":"I love tamales, so when I saw this place on Yelp, I knew I had to try it. The draw for me, besides the rating, was the selection - several types of tamales including a couple vegetarian, vegan, and dessert options. There's something for everyone! Their website also boasts, \"NO lard, shortening, gluten, preservatives, MSG, soy, trans fats, high fructose corn syrup, or junk here.\" Fabulous!

You can place an order via telephone, e-mail, or form on their website. I really like the convenience of the electronic options and it ensures there's no miscommunication on your order. They recommend placing your order within 24-48 hours. I placed mine a day in advance and everything went very smoothly. I used e-mail and received a prompt response.

The interaction at the store was just as painless as the ordering process. The store was easy to find with the large \"TAMALES\" on the plaza's street sign. It's a cute shop with a counter and comfortable seating. It took a couple minutes to locate our order in the back, then we paid and that was it! 

The tamales are sold in sets of two, sealed, and labeled. I was really impressed with the packaging! We ordered two dozen and they were frozen for pick-up, which was great. Prices: Pack (2) is $5.50, 1/2 Dozen is $16, and 1 Dozen is $28. You're obviously getting the better deal with the dozen. The price difference is not vast (42 cents per tamale between the pack and dozen costs), but for each dozen, that's $5 in savings!

Heating instructions: Microwave frozen tamale wrapped in damp paper towel for four minutes (with wax paper and corn husk intact) OR steam frozen tamale for 35-40 minutes on medium heat (with wax paper and corn husk intact). I used the microwave option and it worked perfectly!

The moment of truth: How do they taste? Well, I'm sure you already guessed from my five-star rating that I'm in love. THEY'RE AMAZING! We started with the Pork Red Chile, which I was most excited since I LOVE adobada sauce and it exceeded my expectations. The masa is moist and very flavorful, all their meats (chicken, beef, pork) are tender, and the amount of sauce is perfect. Oh my gosh, the FLAVOR!! 

We also had Chicken Chipotle, Chicken Green Chile, Beef Red Chile, Tex-Mex, and Poblano Chiles & Monterey Jack. We really liked the flavor of the Chicken Chipotle and there's a little kick. Their chile verde is so, so good! I can't believe I missed Chicken Mole on the menu, so that's on my list for the next order! Favorites: Pork Red Chile, Chicken Green Chile, and Chicken Chipotle. I REALLY like the red chile, so I'm sure all the meat options taste great in it. I didn't care for the Tex-Mex one, so I'd pass on that.

I will definitely be ordering more tamales during my future trips to Arizona! Oh yes, they traveled the 300 miles well and we are still enjoying them."}
{"text":"Tamales... without attitude! 

Not an easy place to find, I drove by several times... keep your eyes open or bring a friend. The \"store\" is just that... small area with a chalk board menu that ( based on the amount on dust on the sill ) changes allot. I was greeted by a genuinely attractive and extremely pleasant woman that was eager to help. 

Their menu includes many different types of Tamales.....7 different types of Meat combinations, 4 Types of Vegetarian, 4 Types of Vegan and 3 types of \"Dessert\" Tamales. Each tamale is $2.00 6 for $11.00 or 12 for $22.00. Frozen & ready to heat and eat! 

** NOTE: as of my writing, no debit or credit cards accepted! 

I opted for the Chicken with green chile, Green corn and cream cheese, Beef red and pork red. For dinner tonight I had the Chicken Green Chile and the Green Corn and cream cheese..

First let me say,, the masa is AMAZING.. fluffy, lots of flavor.. the best I've ever eaten.. the chicken filling however... not to my liking.. the dark meat chicken filling reminded me of a pot pie filling... OK... just not great. 

The green corn and cheese... was a different story. Fantastic, tons of corn, chiles and cream cheese. I LOVED it... the whole tamale was a big fluffy yummy tamale!!! I didn't even use the salsa I made.. the favors alone were enuf. 

I look forward to trying the rest of my purchases, but right now... I recommend that you at least stop by, pick up a few and try them... I'm sure that you'll find something you really enjoy.

{"text":"I like how you can buy assorted tamales by the dozen."}
{"text":"These are the best tamales I've ever had. I've had tamales from places that claimed to be the best in San Diego and So Cal and were highly rated on Yelp - those ones don't even compare.

Though, I will be honest, I have only had the vegetarian varieties.  However, every tamale I have eaten is great there. What makes them different, is that their tamale is so moist and full of flavor, unlike most tamales I've had. They have a wide selection of vegetarian, vegan, and meat tamales.  My favorite tamale is the green corn and cream cheese.  Amazing!

I get them whenever I go to the farmer's market in Phoenix or Scottsdale. You can also order ahead of time and pick up your order at the farmers market."}
{"text":"I was skeptical when they handed me already frozen tamales, but when I warmed them up they were super fresh, moist, and delicious!"}
{"text":"I give 5 stars for excellence in their quality of food, flavor, variety, affordability, service and customer service. I just found this shop on yelp on a look out for something new to try out in this neighborhood. Their staff is very helpful in assisting during order placement. Tamales can be picked up as soon as they are ready. If you call ahead, they can tell you when your fav ones are going to be ready. We tried the southwest chipotle and green corn with cream cheese. Let me tell you, if you have a thing for spicy foods go for the southwest chipotle.  100% vegan, full of spice & flavor and nowhere else to be found. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The tamales are outstanding. I've had many tamales over the years and there was always plenty of masa and very little filling......NOT at The Tamale Store. The tamales are meaty, substantial and delicious. I look forward to the fall so I can try the sweet tamales.

We are having family over for dinner next Sunday and will be stopping here to pick up tamales."}
{"text":"One week before Christmas and already out of beef tamales.  Forget your holiday tamales, folks.

They're not taking orders by phone (so says their website). So I drove to their storefront on Cave Creek this morning.  Give me 3 dozen red chile beef.  Already out.  Ok, give me the red chile pork as an alternate.  Already out of that too.  

Guys, it's Christmas.  Most people want the traditional.  The other restaurant I drove to after leaving The Tamale Store had the traditional red chile beef so I bought there.  I will buy there next time, too, because I don't have time to waste with The Tamale Store."}
{"text":"Just picked up a 1/2 dozen of these at the downtown Chandler farmers market.  I was a little hesitant because of the price, but they were worth every penny.  Not to mention that they are about 1 1/2 times the size of the average tamale.  Tried the poblano and jack cheese so far and can't wait to try the others.  I will definately go back and pick up some more soon."}
{"text":"OH MAH GAWD!

Normally I don't *love* tamales because they are relatively dry, but when I saw The Tamale Store selling Tamales at the Downtown Public Market I just had to try one. They have three regular vegan options in addition to two dessert vegan options, and 5 vegetarian options.

So, I decided to get a hot Southwest Chipotle and ate it at the market, and got an additional 6 frozen; a combo of Southwest Chipotle, Pumpkin, and Sweet Corn.

Well, these tamales are freaking delicious. Incredibly moist and flavorful, but with very few ingredients, and you can pronounce all of them! 

Their website touts \"We use only the freshest produce and extra lean meats. We never use lard or shortenings. We never use preservatives!!\" It is OBVIOUSLY true.

I love The Tamale Store!!!"}
{"text":"We never knew tamales could taste this good; we love their tamales! We have been buying them at farmers' markets for about a year and have never visited their store.

The tamales have incredibly moist and delicious masa with high quality fillings. Nice, big chunks of chicken breast, tender and juicy beef or pork, and just the right amount of seasonings.

Our favorites are Chicken Green Chile and Green Corn Cream Cheese, followed closely by Beef Red Chile and Pork Red Chile. We always have Chicken Green Chile in the freezer. They also make seasonal flavors and some vegetarian / vegan varieties (the Mushrooms, Corn and Spinach flavor is fabulous). These tamales are truly addictive.

The frozen tamales are fast and easy to heat: when heating one, I wrap with waxed paper or plastic wrap and add a couple of drops of water, then microwave 2 minutes on each side or until piping hot. 

Try them with a fried egg on top for a spectacular breakfast. 

As of this writing, all of their tamales are 8 oz. each. Pack of 2 $5.00; 1/2 dozen $15.00
1 dozen $27.00. Best of all, you can mix and match!

Check their website for the various farmers' markets they attend.

We're so lucky to have The Tamale Store in the valley of the sun!"}
{"text":"We recently tried The Tamale Store for the first time, to pick up some Christmas tamales.  With my first bite of the chipotle chicken tamale, I knew that we had come across something very special!  Then came the red chile and green chile pork tamales!  They were also delicious as well!  The no-lard masa was soft and moist, not too thick and not too thin.  The meat in the center of each tamale was moist and flavorful, not too much meat and not too little meat.  The moist and delicate texture of both the masa and the meat filling within were perfectly balanced, unlike many other tamales that have a thick and dry masa covering and a tiny dollop of equally dried-out meat in the center.  The store's proprietary salsa also adds to the flavor and experience of enjoying their tamales, and I particularly enjoyed their smoky-tasting red chile salsa when liberally applied to each tamale.  We plan to go back regularly.  Why wait until Christmas!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican Food Ive had in Arizona. Im a southern california native, so Ive definitely missed the authenticity thats been lacking in most Mexican food in Arizona. I found this place at my school's farmer's market (asu) and I was surprised at the selection, authenticity, and quality. Better than most Mexican food in California too. Im a vegetarian and I was so thankful for the vegan and vegetarian options. Its not like they have one or two vegan and vegetarian options, they had it all! and I heard they serve a kickass chicken tamale too."}
{"text":"Purchased my tamales today at the Gilbert Farmers Market! Quite simply the best tamales I have ever had. I purchased a half dozen plus one (chile relleno) and I can honestly say that I wished I had listened to the guy manning the booth and purchased a full dozen. The prices are a bit daunting @ $19 for a half dozen but trust me, the quality is worth it. Will definitely purchase again and again."}
{"text":"Tried out this spot based on the yelp reviews and my love for tamales , maybe I'm just plain spoiled growing up in AZ and enjoying homemade tamales my entire childhood .... They were just ok, tried 3 different kinds and spent a small fortune ....   Based on the size of the Tamale , was thinking I was going to get my $ worth ...   The inside of the tamale was very good , but had to get thru the thick bland maza to get to the great taste ...  You are paying for the outside , as that is where the bulk of the tamale is ...   less maza more meat please !!!!

Just Ok ........."}
{"text":"This place sells some darn good tamales considering it is challenging to find places in Phoenix to buy them. You can pick them up at local Farmer's Markets during the week or pre-order them and pick them up at the store.

I am a vegetarian so I went for the Vegan one with corn, spinach, and mushrooms. It was pretty fantastic. My carnivore friend says the pork one is the best one out of the meat selection.

Make sure to have exact change if you stop into the store..and yes, it is slightly difficult to find. 

Buena suerte! :)"}
{"text":"Awwww man!  Quick addendum...PLEASE add the Chicken Chipotle tamales to the \"EAT THESE!!\" list."}
{"text":"Delicious and super filling. 2 of these tamales will do the trick for me. Always go with the fresh selection and I will admit the beef tamales are one of the best tamales I have ever had. LOVE IT! I'm a huge fan especially when it comes to local vendors!"}
{"text":"I first heard about them at the Roadrunner Park Farmer's Market (on Cactus near the 51), a while back. I tried a sample, as they are gluten free, not many things are at the market. They were delicious! Ended up purchasing quite a few, including some pumpkin dessert tamales, which were really good as well. They come in a 2-pack and what I really like is the convenience of a tamale. They heat up quickly and are great for a fast dinner or to take to work for a quick lunch on a busy day. Add some tortilla chips, maybe a little salsa and/or guacamole and boom, instant meal. YUM-O award!"}
{"text":"Best tamales I  have had anywhere. There is ample filling in each tamale that keeps them from being just a meal of corn masa. The flavors like green chili pork and chicken chipotle also add interest to what can be a bland meal, especially when eaten repeatedly over time. The healthy (no lard) natural ingredients make them one of the few \"frozen\"  foods that work with diet restrictions. The Tamale Store does what you would hope: one thing really well."}
{"text":"These tamales are soooo good and very affordable...they sell them in pairs for $4. I grab some every Weds at the local Farmers Market and I have been happy with them every time. They have a great selection of both meat/vegetarian and red/green chile. Also, I love how they are made without lard...not only are they delicious, they are healthy!"}
{"text":"We were big fans of the Tamale Store for a while. The vegetarian tamales were almost like a rite of passage through every farmer's market we've been at - Ahwatukee, Downtown Phoenix, Chandler & Gilbert. They have always been masa-heavy but the salt and spice in the masa is just right that the flavors come off well. 

But since 2008, we feel like the size and quality have been going downhill. Today we bought half dozen, and four of them were incredibly dry and crumbly, and the other two were not because they were cheese-based. The outside looked like they had been sitting open for days, so there was a dried out layer that I mistook for husk. Also, we bought some frozen to take home after a long time, but I just noticed \"natural flavors\" in the ingredient list. Not quite the small home-style vendor anymore, eh?   

That is the end of our affair, Tamale Store!"}
{"text":"BLACK BEAN CILANTRO TAMALE.


Best tamale I've ever had, and I'm an Arizona native from a consistent tamale-making family(don't tell them I said dis)...

Bought them from the farmers market on a whim, I eat vegetarian but decided to try the vegan options since they sounded good. So far have only had the black bean, but I've got a mushroom, corn spinach one that is in my freezer currently tempting my gut. Can't wait to try some other options, the convenience of the farmers market is perfect! I bought frozen, but could only imagine how amazing fresh. 

BUY DEEZ TAMALES"}
{"text":"As their sign says \"unwrap a fiesta\" 

It is a party in your mouth... take that as you will. Meat and Masa.. you cannot really go wrong. I love all their combos that they offer.... I ate off the boyfriend's beef tamales and it was YUMMMMY!!  

Another high point from the Scottsdale Farmer's Market"}

Not your ordinary tamales.  These are large moist and fresh.  I first encountered them at the Phoenix Public Market on Saturdays and occasionally on First Fridays, with steamers full of a variety of tamale flavors to please the Vegan, Vegeterian and meat lover alike.  

With fillings from traditional Pork Red Chile and Beef Red Chile to Spinach Mushroom, Shrimp, Chicken (red or green)  or my favorite Green Chile, Corn with Cream cheese.  You have to check out their menu of choices they always seem to have something new or seasonal.  They have them warm in steamers or frozen to take home for later.  [They defrost and reheat very well.  Reheat in the wrap or wrap a moist paper towel over the wrapped tamale to ensure it won't dry out.]

A fan of their moist delicious fluffy masa, I am not a fan of the shrimp tamale I had and the tamale traditionalist part of me found that the Pork Red Chile had too much cumin for my flavor.  I can always count on the goodness of the Green Corn Tamale (Corn, green chile and cream cheese).

When I forget to pick up a few on Saturday I can always find them in the freezer at Phoenix Public Market."}
{"text":"I'd heard good things about this place (I think they were mentioned as the best tamale in Phoenix magazine). They even have vegetarian and vegan varieties! I was sold! Then I went and got some. Funny thing, I mentioned several times I was a vegetarian and wanted only tamales without meat. When I found that I had been given several meat ones I was displeased. The tamales without meat were pretty good though I've certainly had better. All in all a good bet if you're at one of the many markets going on in the valley."}
{"text":"Poorest customer service ever- haven't even had a chance to order and eat the tamales and unfortunately never will. Our company called to order tamales for our entire branch- we had a large order and were eager to try these tamales. We called and was told they weren't taking orders any longer but if we called in the morning we could have them put aside anything they had leftover- when we called we were then told by a different person that they can't put aside anything for us to come pick up (we are 10 min away) and then the man on the phone proceeded to rudely say if we had planned weeks ago they might be able to help us with our order?! 
We won't bother, thank you though."}
{"text":"OMG!  I didn't even like tamales before I bought these!  So amazing!  They do not use lard.  They are stuffed with delicious fillings, kind of like a burrito.  I enjoy the vegitarian ones and the rest of my family loves the chicken fillings, especially chicken mole and chicken chipole.  A little pricey, but well worth it!  We already went through 3 and 1/2 dozen and I have to go back for more. The sevice is wonderful too.  They sell this little jar of hot chilis and seeds (pumpkin, sunflower, sesame) in a mildly hot oil.  It's great on the tamales. Add a little sour cream and a fried egg on top and BAM!"}
{"text":"Best tamales in Phoenix maybe even the world. The Masa is fluffy and very flavorful and too boot lard free. Portions are generous. Tamales may seem to be a bit on the pricey side but who has time to hand craft such an amazing and delightful tamale. It's worth every penny. So many different options it's like Christmas exploring the menu. Our go too option when entertaining friends and family."}
{"text":"Great tamales and friendly service. These tamales are large and full of flavor. The Pablano chile tamale is a must try!"}
{"text":"I heard once that you can't make good, moist tamales without lard, but that person was wrong. The Tamale Store makes theirs without lard, without shortening, and they're the best tamales I've ever eaten. 

You know how so many tamales disappoint and make you sad when you break your fork into them because they only hold a hint of something inside? That's not what these are like. These are packed with all kinds of stuff. Corn. Mushrooms. Spinach. 

And they're unbelievably moist. Even though the tamale store has meat-filled and vegetarian options, our meat-eating friends have fallen in love with the vegan tamales after we introduced them. We all insist they are the best tamales we've ever eaten. The Southwest Chipotle is the best of all. 

The cool thing is that you don't have to be near their location to get some. The Tamale Store has booths at Farmer's Markets all around the valley, most days of the week. You can check their site for the scheduled day in your city."}
{"text":"We discovered The Tamale Store by doing an online search after our previous supplier was going downhill fast.  Sorry we didn't find The Tamale Store sooner!  The service is outstanding...happy and attentive owner and her staff of family members.  The salsas which are also made by The Tamale Store are outstanding.  We had the opportunity to be the first to try two new salsas in smaller jars at the store.  There are no labels on them yet, so new, but oh my....so delicious.  I love the one with the pumpkin seeds and chiles.  Yummmm on eggs, burritos, tacos, beans & rice...just about anything actually.  Now the tamales....the best!!!!  We have two different flavors for dinner and believe me, you won't need anything else.  Really filling and delicious!  We live in Sun City West, but are willing to drive over to the store to buy our tamales by the frozen dozens.  Now they are attending Farmers Markets throughout the Valley.  Check their web site for dates & locations.  Sun City at 99th & Bell on Thursdays thru the Fall & Winter.  You'll meet the lovely Caroline or Maria...both daughters to Martha, the owner.  You can have a tamale there or take home dozens as we do!  The Tamales are great for any meal...from breakfast to late night snack to dessert.  The Pumpkin rocks!   Thank you, Martha and family for the great dining experience in our home!!!"}
{"text":"These are the best tamales I've ever had. Very fresh and light, with interesting but not overwhelming flavor profiles. They're also large. The complaints about price are off-base, because the each one is at least twice the size I typically see."}
{"text":"With high hopes after reading a local paper's review of this place, I went and bought some tamales, sweet corn, chicken and beef. The tamales are quite expensive at over  $3 each but I'm normally willing to pay more for good food. 

Sadly this was not the case. The sweet corn were not good at all. My wife and I didn't finish what we heated up. Not much corn and not very sweet. The beef were a bit better as were the chicken. Very disappointed. I will try other places for tamales because I'll not be returning here."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for quite a while but could never get there with the hours of business. 

Tried the Pork Red Tamale and the Green Pork Tamale. 

2 tamales for $7
6 tamales for $20
12 tamales for $35

The tamales are a little larger than most places and loaded with a generous amount of meat, but as a native of AZ, growing up these are the size I am used to and I just think the other places have just made their tamales smaller. As I mentioned, there is a generous amount of meat, but the taste is kindof on the bland side, I don't like spicy, but not the most flavorful tamales. 

Don't plan on eating in here not unless you want to sit on the floor because there are no chair or tables to sit down and eat."}
{"text":"The Chicken green chile tamale is lights out. I've had some of the others but that one is by far the best. 

The owner's daughter is also lights out. Super cute. Call me maybe?"}
