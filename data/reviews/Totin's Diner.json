{"text":"the service has always been good , prices are reasonable .I've eaten there several times .I had a cold hamburger served to me. I would recommend it for breakfast ,  Except Sunday when are very crowded"}
{"text":"I eat breakfast all around pittsburgh - my knowledge of the city's food is an area of pride for me. With a close and warm atmosphere, Totin's immediately pulls you in. After having some decent coffee (that one specific piece won't win any medals), I got Deb's Cinamon Swirl French Toast (or something akin to that name) and I died a little. It was crispy, succulent, buttery, and every other positive adjective you can use. My hash browns, though a little salty, were delicious. My friend's pancake was the size of her head. Overall, incredible meal and I'm so happy we went."}
{"text":"Never heard of it. Was in Wexford for something medical, got good news, and decided to treat myself to breakfast that wasn't from a chain. Yelped 'breakfast' and Totins showed up. Glad it did. Small, cute, crowded diner that looks like the 50's. Sat at the counter as there were no tables. Watched the kitchen staff quickly make breakfast. Wait staff was hurried but friendly enough. Food was excellent. Prices were on the slightly high side. Will definitely go back if I'm ever in Wexford again."}
{"text":"A regular Breakfast place of ours, the menu combines old fresh and tasty favorites with some creative twists. teh owner is on site with a big personality, service is prompt, food warm. Big or Little Al, if you go home hungry it's your fault! Avoid the chains, go to Totins!"}
{"text":"This place was super good! I would eat here every day if I could. I had the little Al, I couldn't finish it all. I thought the little dinner feel was good times even though I wore Cleveland Brown shirt on season day opener Brownies vs the Stalling, stale, Steelers! The place had gyro omelette, kielbasa sausage, pierogies for sides, different breakfast options as well as good old traditional ones. Great little place!"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place until we were waiting the 20 minutes like the hostess said....two guys walked in and asked if they called their name to which the hostess said \"yeah a while ago\". They said \"oh man\" and she replied \"it's okay I'll just put you at the top of the list\". SO the two young men flirting with the young hostess got to skip in front of the at least 10 parties ahead of them, and the 20 minute wait. I won't be back. VERY disappointed."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here. Really  good food and excellent portions. The bacon was actually substantial not the paper thin kind you get at other places. Service was also very good. Would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Good food inexpensive, quick service. Best breakfast in the north hills"}
{"text":"Excellent menu, good prices, great service.  Had the turkey dinner and it was like thanksgiving."}
{"text":"Best diner ever. We love everything. We had their burgers and potato salad for graduation party...nothing but rave reviews. Took left overs to work and got more compliments. Best French onion soup we have ever eaten. Love the pierogies. Every visit has been excellent. Matter of fact, we would rather eat here than any big named chain."}
{"text":"Looks good from the outside but that is where it stops. When you walk into a 'diner' the first thing you should smell is fresh brewed coffee. Not here, that was the first clue we were in for trouble. What 'diner' would be caught dead serving food service liquid coffee, that's right folks, packaged liquid coffee that's heated and dispensed. No fresh brewing here! Now to breakfast. I ordered poached eggs that came out almost solid. My son in law ordered over easy, guess what, they were hard also. Obviously they don't know how to cook eggs.  Service was some young girl who could care less about being there. Basic ' are you ready' and that's it. Drop food off and never come back to the table.  It's a shame because the place looks really neat. Could be a great place but food and service needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"Totin's is a great local breakfast joint.  The service is always good and they have the best coffee in Wexford.  The totins combo is good with eggs, bacon or sausage and choice of potato.  A great place to grab breakfast on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Every restaurant offers a hot roast beef sandwich, but Totin's dinner has to be the best I ever had. Ate there twice, both times having the roast beef sandwich."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the third time over two years. They need a general clean-up. My coffee was served in a badly stained mug. All the condiments (jars and such) on the table should have been wiped down (sticky). My table still had some egg left on it. Husband said the bathroom was dirty. Hamburger was just mediocre, but the cole slaw was good. Pretty pricey for sandwiches. Family of 4 at a nearby table only ordered water with their food. When we got the bill and saw the coffee was $2.40 then I knew why they ordered water. Our bill with the tip was $29.00. That's ridiculous for the quality of the food. Best part was the atmosphere in the diner itself. It's really comfortable. They really could be much better than they are at cleanliness, pricing and presentation of food."}
{"text":"My kids (4 and 5) LOVE the pancakes - which are the size of a medium pizza.  The pancakes also seem to have a doughnut-like consistency and taste; which, is also a big plus for my kids.  This is one of the very few places where they will finish everything on their plate.  But we do split their pancakes in half for them and take the other halves home.  I am a big fan of their omelets - and the breakfast sandwiches.  My wife goes for sunny-side up and homefries every time.  Very happy to have a diner this good close to home."}
{"text":"This is what happens when a chef collides head-on with a diner. Great food, big portions, friendly staff, clean facility. Congratulations for a job well done !!!  Might want to change the french fries to steak fries. (just a personal preference)"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, but, if you want something unforgettable try their Breakfasts. Their French Toast is amazing, and the portions are very nice. This is home cooking away from home."}
{"text":"I went to Totin's Diner with my wife and 90 year old mother this morning for breakfast. I had heard many good comments about Totin's.  Our visit started positively. The diner has great decor and ambiance. The flatware is substantial and doesn't bend when you look at it. The wait staff was prompt and very curtious. My wife ordered \"Cinnamon French Toast \".We assumed that this would be traditional french toast dipped in egg then grilled. It wasn't it was cinnamon swerl bread with a glaze. Plus it was delivered to the table cold along with cold bacon.  When we asked about the egg coating that was to be on the toast we were told that it was a french cinnamon bread. Very disappointing! My mother and I both ordered omelets although somewhat tasty and warm both were slightly over cooked and chewy. We felt that if the description of the \"French Toast \"had been better my wife would have ordered another meal. We probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've only been for breakfast, and it's always good, today was no exception, even the healthier egg white omelette is good. The staff is always nice and quick, and the coffee is endless!!"}
{"text":"Consistently great food. Pirogies offered as a side. Fresh and delicious diner and American meal fare. Fantastic. This us a new building and you can eat outside in fair weather. I  do love older diners too / more actually - but I give this diner 5 stars because they are excelling at what they are trying to provide. This is an extremely satisfying meal every time."}
{"text":"Totin's is great! It is a small diner that serves up fantastic food.  The space is small so you make have to wait for a table, but it is worth it!  The pancakes are fantastic; my father is a huge fan.  They also have great entrees for lunch.  Portions are pretty big so make sure you take things home for leftovers. (They also have a small plates section with slightly smaller portions). You have to love the Pittsburgh fare of pierogies on the menu.  It is a fabulous, local diner to go to for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Small diner but very clean.  Floors, booths, walls and restrooms very clean.  That is a great sign to leave me to believe the kitchen is clean as well. Food quality was great.  Breakfast is easy, but can some poorly.  Not in this place!!  Home run on eggs, sausage, toast and pirogies.  The French onion soup was also great.  Highly recommend.  The potato pancake were also great.  The chicken fingers were frozen, not fresh.  Just be aware.  Great GEM in Wexford.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"Well, we remember when this place was a mechanic's car garage, so we had always been curious what they did with it.....so it is an early Saturday evening when we decide to check it out. First, they have a nice big parking lot and upon entering it looks like a great small diner. We were instantly greeted, seated at a booth, and drinks presented within about 1 minute. The menu is typical diner (omelettes w/ potato choice and bread choice about $9....burgers, wraps, and dinner specials).  They also have TVs up high on ever wall for those that are interested (Penguin game night) but also not so loud or distracting that it interferes with the meal.  We got a hot sausage omelette and a meatloaf dinner. MMMM, it was all excellently prepared and delicious - homemade mashed potatoes and fresh grean beans....hot local sausage, tasty potato hash, really we have no complains. With the dinner, for a $1 surcharge, we got a very large and delicious French Onion Soup. Wife and I both commented on how good the food was (diner food, no one is expecting 5 star here!).  Everyone there was super friendly - the waitress was great and always on top of things and the main cook (owner?) came by a couple of times to thank us for stopping by.  We didn't know what to expect, but this will probably be our new local diner stop when we are looking for that kind of food - much better atmosphere than the Pancake House."}
{"text":"My husband and I love a good diner. Totin's didn't disappoint. The sausage was delicious - good flavor and spice. The Deb's cinnamon swirl French toast was cooked to perfection with a combination of crispy outside and soft center;it was sweet but not too intense. I was excited about the potatoes with peppers and onions but disappointed - they could have used salt (and I rarely salt heavy meals like this) and they were undercooked."}
{"text":"Have lunch and lose brain cells at the same time with Fox Noise being blasted at you."}
{"text":"Food is good however when you sit at the counter you hear all the bitching from the girls/wait staff. It's annoying and makes you wanna leave. They seem like they don't like one another. Cooks are funny though and always seem to be in a good mood and enjoy what they do. The girls leave Clorox wipes right in front of you in the counter....really. Come on now. That's disgusting. Walls and floors need cleaning really bad. Laurie is the counter waitress and she is always unhappy and complaining. She is annoying. Also they refill their ketchup and hot sauce bottles, they look like the original ones that they had when they first opened."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm, comfort food!!! Their prices have gone up some since opening but it's worth it. I see reviews about the coffee... I love their coffee!!! The wait gets intense at certain times, like after church... But that's to be expected for a diner. I go back! :)"}
{"text":"I stumbled across Totin's while I was looking for a place to grab something quick and easy, that wasn't fast-food, before I went to Whole Foods. I am so very happy I saw the \"Diner\" sign and stopped. The diner was clean, help was friendly, food was delicious, and the portions were huge! I highly recommend Totin's and will definitely be coming back. I have a feeling this may become a habit every time I visit Whole Foods!"}
{"text":"Ask for over med eggs and received over hard didn't care for the what they call home fries, service OK ."}
{"text":"It's been a hot minute since my last stop here, but I remember the food being pretty exceptional. There aren't many places that offer pierogies as a side dish for any meal. The plates are big, so make sure you go with an appetite. I'm usually a breakfast food kinda guy. I'm not a native to Pittsburgh nor a Steelers fan, but I can definitely appreciate all the old school and vintage sports memorabilia that all along the walls here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Cute place; just like a diner should be. Had the pretzel burger....delicious! Waitress was very friendly. Can't wait to come back for breakfast or dinner!"}
{"text":"Tried this diner today with my boyfriend and we were both very impressed. You seat yourself as you walk in and we didn't wait long. We both ordered coffee and the Totin's combo.   The options for this combo are amazing. You get two eggs, bacon or sausage and a choice of hash browns , potato pancakes or pierogis and a choice of toast or English muffin.   I got it with bacon and the potato pancakes and he got it with the pierogis. You get four slices of thick bacon and it was cooked perfectly. The eggs were huge and the pancakes were seasoned well. I tasted his pierogis which came sautéed with onions and they were delicious and seemed homemade.   We both agreed we would come back. The environment was nice and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place!!!! Huge and tasty portions at the most reasonable and amazing pricing. My parents and I stopped in (my mom is vegan) and we all had a great and filling breakfast! Two thumbs way up - stop by if you're ever near Totin's diner!"}
{"text":"Don't let the wait discourage you! Everything is fantastic and the portions are huge. The potato pancakes are the best around. The Totin Reuben's are my favorite. It has kielbasa instead. Very good!  There is a small plate section for those that cannot eat the huge portions. Those are still pretty large."}
{"text":"Quite an experience. I seldom get a day off and decided to stop and have breakfast.Waited in line for about 30 minutes and finally got a booth. Ordered and waited approx. 20 minutes for food. I took about 15 minutes to finish. As soon as I finished, a middle age dark haired waitress came to my booth and said are you almost finished, because we have other people waiting.Are you kidding me?How ignorant can you get.Completely ruined. I got up and looked at that waitress and said you have a lot of b---s asking me that. She said your are just one person at a booth and I have a customer waiting. I called the owner and he didn't seem much interested. I will never step foot in that place again.We had several car cruises here with car clubs previously. Never again. The word is out."}
{"text":"Ate here this morning for breakfast. Portions are huge.  I suggest you be very hungry. Nice diner atmosphere.  Very 50s-60s feel to it. Prices are quite reasonable and service was good. Definitely worth a try when you are in the area."}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot! Omelettes are super big! I had the bacon and cheese omelette with hash browns. You get a lot of food with your meals. The only downside is the wait. I've noticed this place gets pretty packed pretty quickly (granted it's pretty small). I'd still come back if I wasn't in a rush."}
{"text":"I bought the Big Al breakfest, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, shredded potatoes and pancakes. Eggs were fluffy, the bacon thick cut, sausage were good sized, pancakes were as big as frisbees. Everthing tasted fantastic. Great service and clean !"}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Big portions.  Love the Pittsburgh atmosphere.   Pierogis are a side choice instead of hash browns!   Love that.   Timing is important. It gets packed quick. If you don't want to wait on a Saturday morning you have to roll in before 8:30.   However, it's worth the wait.  We are and will be repeat visitors."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was kinda slow. Went in with my dad for Father's Day and they couldn't handle the traffic. My food came out, then my sides in 5 minute intervals."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting Totin's Diner. We were part of the after-church rush, but impressively they managed to seat us without much of a wait. (I can't say so much for the people that arrived after us). There were four of us - just regular people looking for a regular breakfast. My choice off the menu was the Peanut Butter & Banana Pancakes and my wife went with Deb's Cinnamon Swirl French Toast combo. We thought they sounded good, and for a moment I was envious of her choice. After all, who can say \"no\" to \"two thick slices of cinnamon bread buttered, grilled, and topped with cinnamon glaze?\"  The diner was busy and we had good company, so we weren't deterred by the extra wait to get our meals. I occasionally looked up to the kitchen and watched as the guys in the back set plates of food on the counter, ready to be taken out to the customers. Never mind that the toast fell off the plate and onto the counter top - it's easily tossed back on the plate. Yum.   Finally it was our turn.  As our waitress began to bring out our meals, there was only one thing that occupied my mind:  HOLY HUGE BREAKFAST, BATMAN! THAT'S A LOT OF PANCAKE!  There is no question in my mind that this is the largest serving of pancakes served up in the history of pancakes. There has never been a more grossly exaggerated assumption of my eating abilities than this mountain of food. I seem to also recall a real life \"LOL\" that originated from myself a the mere sight of them. This is the kind of meal that should warrant your picture being enshrined on the wall should you be so unfortunate as to eat it all in one sitting.   With pancakes like this, I couldn't imagine what the French toast would look like. When it did come out, however, I discovered that it didn't require a lot of imagination at all. Apparently, \"two thick slices\" translates to a single slice with a diagonal cut. Who knew? How was it that I had enough pancake in front of me to feed the whole diner and my wife was given a single piece of toast?   In addition to the portion-size debacle, we were more than underwhelmed with the quality of the food. The \"cinnamon glaze\" was non-existent on my wife's French toast and, staring at my Franken-breakfast, I couldn't help but think, \"where's the peanut butter?\" Certainly it could have been hidden below the pancakes. I would never have known. There was far too much food to dig through and the flavor was mediocre at best. They were left on the table partially eaten, and I was left disappointed.   It's sad to say we will not likely return to Totin's."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed when I visited Totin's today.  There was a bit of a wait for a table and during my wait I noticed most folks got the pot roast sandwich.  Perhaps I should have followed the crowd rather than getting a hot turkey sandwich.  My sandwich arrived quickly with the gravy on the side as I had requested.  It probably would have been better with the gravy on it to begin with as the bread was not very fresh.  I took the top piece off and doused the bottom and the turkey with the gravy and then added pepper as it was just too bland for my taste.  Mashed potatoes were the highlight of the meal.  My coffee cup has coffee stains on the side that didn't look very fresh so I'm hoping the rest of the cup was cleaner (I didn't look too close!).  Sometime when we are headed this way earlier in the day I would stop to try breakfast but would not go out of my way to have lunch here again."}
{"text":"They have excellent French toast, not your typical French toast.  Dry and sweet and buttery.  I also really like their meatloaf sandwiches.  Very kid friendly atmosphere which I appreciate."}
{"text":"We've been to Totin's several times. My family and I have tried most things on the menu from kielbasa to meatloaf to French toast to pot roast to breakfast plates with eggs, bacon & hashbrowns. Today I had their pretzel burger & it was delicious. The pot roast is my absolute fave, but this was a close second. My husband liked his breakfast plate. My mom thought the French toast was just ok. My cousin liked the meatloaf. The food is always good. That's why I give it 4 stars. The service is inconsistent. Sometimes the staff is very nice & attentive. Other times they seem angry to be there & like they're doing you a favor waiting on you. Service is very important to me. With all the restaurants coming to the area restaurants need to take care of their customers or they will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We ate the whole thing. Every last morsel. Don't judge until you try it.   What I am speaking of is the Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Combo which features their very unique and delicious French toast made from thick cut, lightly grilled, cinnamon sugar glazed cinnamon swirl bread. I add maple syrup because it adds a nice deep maple flavor. It's slightly crunchy and best eaten warm although I scarfed my very cold serving down because I couldn't stop eating the fresh eggs, perfectly crisp thick cut bacon, and pirogies with onions.   This is one big delicious plate of food! And yeah, I ate the whole thing. I'll do it again."}
{"text":"For what it is worth, this is only one person's opinion.. one of the other people I ate with really liked the place. I'm giving this a two-star rating because it was just basic and unexciting.  It wasn't terrible and the food was alright but it didn't particularly make me enthusiastic about coming back again.    The good: our waitress was friendly and checked up on the table often.  The bad: the environment really wasn't appetizing. I know it's a small place and a diner, but I really could have done without all the flies hovering around on my seat while eating."}
{"text":"A little out of the way for me, but I try to go whenever I am in that part of PGH. Delicious diner-style food, reasonable prices, and a large selection. What you would expect from a good diner. The pierogies are delicious and can come as a side for most any dish."}
{"text":"I got take out from totin's diner. The chocolate milk French toast was one of the grossest things that I have ever eaten. My French Fries were also extremely soggy and hard to eat. The cinnamon French toast was okay, but just okay. I wouldn't recommend the chocolate milk French toast at all, but other than that, everything was mediocre. The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"We had the roasted turkey and field greens wrap, house salad.  The wrap was very good with lots of vinaigrette and turkey.  Service was quick.  Bonus..... we sat next to a current Pittsburgh Pirate and his wife.  I won't say who he is, I respect their privacy, but he is not a pitcher.  Benny Benack says \"Beat 'em Bucs\"!"}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast in the area! Totins even converted me to a French toast lover omg their cinnamon French toast!  their breakfast portions are generous to say the least and the combos satisfy both your sweet cravings (delicious pancakes) to savory cravings (eggs bacon etc) I have never had to wait more than 5 min for a table and service is quick love it overall definitely a great place to go to breakfast... sure beats eatin park and kings yuck."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous and I wish night knew of it before now. The steak hoagie was 12 inches of deliciousness with a side of pierogis which I think were homemade. Even the onions were yummy and I never eat onions. The service was really good. Give them a try..."}
{"text":"Homemade diner food. Specials daily.  Great service. Love the atmosphere. Closes early on Sundays."}
{"text":"Maybe I've been in LA for too long but I have issues with people applying unwanted and excessive amounts of butter on my food. When I order an egg-white omelet I guess I just assume that the waitstaff will connect the dots. Anyway, I got the most perfectly amazing looking omelet that just happened to be swimming in thick pool of butter. My toast was also pre-buttered which irked me because, contrary to my original statement I actually like to slather my toast in the stuff but have a very specific method.  Overall, the coffee was GREAT, the hashy-brown potato stuff was the best I've ever had and the service was impeccable.   If I was ever in the area again, I would definitely go back. I have every confidence that this place has the potential to earn a 4-5 star rating."}
{"text":"Love breakfast here.  The food is always very good especially the potato pancakes.  Went there this morning with a friend who had never been.  Waitress appeared very impatient with friend not readily knowing what he wanted off the menu.  I had to intervene more than once to make friend less uncomfortable about not being ready to order quickly.  At end of meal the waitress refilled both coffee cups.  Before we even had an opportunity to finish half a cup, she was at our table asking how long we would be as there were people waiting.  I understand that, and our intention was not to linger but.... won't be recommending that that any friends meet there to \"catch up\".  Waffles Incaffinated is in the Next strip mall, around the same price and never pushes you out the door.  Expected more from Totins"}
{"text":"Totin's is relatively clean for a diner...but I won't hold that against the place in my rating.    I went for breakfast and decided on the Totin's Combo, your basic eggs and bacon and potatoes and toast breakfast.  (Which, by the way, is cheaper if you get there before 11am Monday through Thursday.)  The sunny side up eggs were small in comparison to the rest of my meal and a tad overcooked on the bottom.  But the fresh shredded hash browns made up for it.    My friends ordered up some four-egg omlets that looked very hearty.  Lots of meat.  Lots of cheese.  Never one to be satisfied with just one breakfast, my friends and I ordered a few other items to share and try.  First, the sausage and biscuits.  Very yummy, with a little kick to the sausage.  Second, an item that intriged us from the moment we saw it on the menu and totally blew our minds: CHOCOLATE. MILK. FRENCH. TOAST.  Seriously.  How has no one ever done this before?  I've never seen it on any other menu and I've been to my fair share of breakfast spots.  I was very excited to try this and it didn't disappoint.  The slices were your average French toast size with a hint of chocolate to the taste and drizzled with chocolate sauce.  It was the perfect dessert to end our otherwise typical breakfast.    I plan on going back, perhaps for one of their lunch or dinner specials.  I was pleased with what I had and the offerings I saw for later in the day as well.  I recommend giving it a try, and if you can avoiding the weekends so there's no wait."}
{"text":"Best American breakfast In north hills . Huge Portions, great prices. Breakfast is the best"}
{"text":"A friend of mine has been raving about this place and now I know why... we visited the last Car Cruse and afterwards we scheduled going to Totin's for dinner! What a great place... food is excellent large portions and offers home style food and cooked just like it came out of Mom's kitchen... wait staff is very friendly and couldn't of been more accommodating to 5 people coming in close to closing time... nice job to you all...   I had to come back and add that what I took home for the next day for lunch wasn't greasy or soggy like most fried fish usually is. I have to say if they aren't the best fish in the Burgh they are one of them.  It's like the fish growing up in Pittsburgh big and delicious!  Thanks for giving Pittsburgh this cute nostalgic place with great food... if you don't like this place maybe it's not the place....hum... : )"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here a few times in the past and everything has been very good tasty and well portioned.  Today we decided to try the Wednesday special Stuffed Cabbage.  We ordered it to go as baby was being fussy.  Took about 20 minutes to receive food and away home we went.  Upon arriving home we were very surprised to see a small amount of the mashed potatoes and 1 Cabbage Roll, although it was large for the daily special of 11.99 we feel that the portion should have been larger.  The taste was not bad but not great average at best.  I like this place for breakfast but not sure about anything else besides that."}
{"text":"This place had such good ratings so we decided to give it a try, local diners never scare us off. Unfortunately it wasn't awesome. The booth was sticky, the food waitress never asked us how it was or if we needed anything else before bringing the check. Felt rushed to get out. The food was large portions but heavy butter/oil and heavily fried. Bacon was a bit burnt. I didn't finish my meal, which rarely happens. We felt weighed down for the rest of the day from all the grease/oil. We may stop elsewhere next time for breakfast, but didn't seem to keep others away....steady stream of visitors came in while we sat.   Good stuff is there was plenty of seating, waitress offered suggestions, decor is unique memorabilia, food came out fast, and decent pricing."}
{"text":"We happened to be in Wexford today and passed this place on the way home (easy to miss)...Glad we stopped!  My wife and I had the Deb's Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Combo.  A thick slice of Bread Works Cinnamon Swirl bread that is buttered, grilled and topped with a cinnamon glaze...Outstanding!  But wait...there's more!  It also came with two eggs, your choice of bacon or sausage links...your choice of potato pancakes, pierogies or hash browns...and... your choice of toast or English muffin...carb overload!  The eggs were perfectly done and the bacon was thick and tasty.  I had the potato pancakes.  Home made from shredded (not mashed) potatoes with lots of onions.  My wife had the potato pierogies.   Grilled in butter and topped with grilled onions.  Both choices were excellent.  The toast or English muffin were barely touched and with everything else, mere afterthoughts.  However, our server explained some people won't dip anything else into their eggs...Oh well!  The diner itself had a clean 1950's decor that made it pleasant inside, with picnic table service outside for those who prefer dining al fresco.  With drinks, our bill came in at $23.00 plus tip.  The service was fine and rated a 15% tip.  A little more personable would have bumped it up to 20%.  The menu included several other breakfast choices along with appetizers, salads, lunch and dinner selections.  There are also daily dinner specials capped off with a 58 oz. prime rib dinner on Saturdays (that's over 3 1/2 pounds) for $44.99. Here is their web site with menu info  http://www.totinsdiner.com/Index.html  We don't get out that way often, but if we do, it will be a stop...hey, it may even be a reason to head out that way!"}
{"text":"We visited Totin's Diner after finding it had the best reviews for breakfast joints in the area. This was hands down the most awful breakfast meal I've ever had. I ordered the Totin's combo which came with 2 eggs of choice, bacon, hash browns, and toast. My eggs were over cooked and had a tint of grey to them, and everything on my plate was slathered in grease and butter. We have a 1 year old and the only fruit option for her was honeydew- a cup of which would have cost $4. There isn't much worse than this experience today. We paid $25 for an all day long tummy ache."}
{"text":"2nd time here and its amazing again. Steak eggs and perogies. Amazing service is quick and on top. Food is so good. Ireccomend everyone go there who is able to. I will be back many times im sure."}
{"text":"I love this place. Just the atmosphere of it makes it feel so laid back and relaxed. The wait staff is super nice, but the way they talk to each other makes them seem real too.   I love sitting at the bar because you can see right into the kitchen as they make your food. My favorite meal is the steak and eggs with a side of the pierogies.   Also, extra points for all of the Steelers memorabilia inside. I like where their loyalties lay."}
{"text":"Love Totin's for breakfast.  I enjoy their two egg omelets.  Nice and fluffy.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that they have a fly problem, and sometimes if they are busy, the omelet can be over cooked.  Yummy pancakes and great sausage too."}
{"text":"Decided to try their Titanic fish dinner .... they call it that for a reason ...it was huge !  It was very good. Their baked potato soup was excellent!  Never a disappointment!"}
{"text":"We came here specifically for my husband and his friend to get the 58 ounce prime rib. This is our 2nd trip here (the first time it was just my husband and me) and we were NOT disappointed.   I got the mushroom swiss cheeseburger.... Step son got kids chicken strips and fries..... Hubby and his friend got the prime rib. Everything came out quickly and was amazing. Our server was great!  Unfortunately, I didn't catch her name, but she was so sweet and very attentive.   The owner, Jim, was very friendly and came by to talk to us. He shook my husband's hand when he told him he was only the 7th person in 8 years of business to finish the 58 prime rib.   We will certainly be back to try more on the menu!  Thank you Jim and the rest of the Totins staff!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for breakfast on a Sunday morning.  There was a little bit of a wait but it was very good.  Please know that the portions are VERY LARGE so if you are looking for a lot of food, this is a good place to go.  The service was good and fast.  We both talked about how we would definitely like to come back another time.  The only reason I ranked it 4 out of 5 stars is because I feel like breakfast is hard to screw up.  If it were another meal, I would have given it a 5 out of 5.  If its as good when we go back for lunch or dinner, I will definitely give it a 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"We loved it! Classic diner. Small. Food quality was above average as well as service. Price was prob above an average diner but worth the slight price increase!"}
{"text":"Totins is a classic breakfast spots in Wexford. The service is fast, breakfast portions are very large, and the food will make your stomach so happy! There really is nothing special about their breakfast, but I love ordering the breakfast platters so you get alittle bit of everything!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I've ever had! My husband and I both ordered the little Al... Omg so much food and it was delicious! We probably could have split one order because we had a lot of leftovers! There was a little bit of a wait for seating but my husband and I got the pleasure of sitting at the bar and I'm glad we did because we got to see that they cracked each individual egg and they we're truly making everything homemade! And that's how all of the food tasted homemade and delicious! If you love breakfast I highly recommend Totins Diner and getting the Little Al you get a sample of everything and the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"My wife just stopped in tonight because we have been searching for good prime rib. We both ordered the 16oz prime rib med well. Sorry to say, it was the worst prime rib we have even had. I sent mine back it was so bad. It was extremely tough to cut through and it was totally tasteless. My wife's was a little more tender but certainly not melt in your mouth by any stretch. It was equally tasteless. I sent mine back, and ordered a meatloaf sandwich. She kept hers and did the best she could but ate less than half. Again, it got tough in the middle. All in all it was very disappointing as we were hoping this would be a part of our weekly stop as we both love prime rib. Again we were shocked at both the unacceptable quality and the lack of taste. So overall we were very disappointed and felt we should let you know. Hopefully it was just a bad night. I know there were only 2 other tables and it was 6:00PM. We try and support our local merchants but this did not go well. Hopefully you can either take it off your menu or strive to obtain a quality product, Finally I must say, event though they were slow, and we told our waitress my wife's was not good, she just didn't get that the food wasn't good. Not very personable.  Seemed like there was a bunch of kids for wait staff and also behind the kitchen. Not sure if ownership was working or not as no one really came over to find out what had happened. I'm sure this place is good for breakfast and sandwiches and they give you lots of food but skip the prime rib. I was awful. Plus it isn't always about the quantity but the quality! When I sent mine back, I instead tried the hot meatloaf sandwich. A huge sandwich and was good however the gravy tasted like it was industrial dark gravy. I would think a place like this would have homemade gravy.  Just a bad experience and I don't think we will be going back. Maybe they should just stick to what they do best. Breakfasts and sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place gives a decent breakfast but isn't anything spectacular. The service was good and I was seated quickly. But the bill was almost $15. For one to eat breakfast. Maybe I m used to a mom and pop place but I thought it was too much for what I got."}
{"text":"Very cool little place.  An actual diner and not some big fancy chain diner.   Friendly service and huge portions.    My pancakes were about a foot in diameter!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and menu included enough variety to satisfy three adults with differing tastes and two toddlers who ate all of their grilled cheese (very cheesy). Burger was very juicy and toppings were fresh. Panini and French toast elicited no complaints.  Service was fast, friendly and very welcoming.  Next time we are in the area, we will definite return to try other menu items.  Restaurant was clean, shiny and very '50's."}
{"text":"Food was very good! Service wasn't great. When the restaurant is empty I don't see why my water should ever be empty! Very nice staff but no refills and having to sit for 15 minutes before our check came doesn't sit well with me."}
{"text":"Pretty good, I suppose.  Nothing really jumps out at you or pushes you away.  It is all standard diner fare with an emphasis on breakfast.  All of the food I had was pretty good, but not great.  They're a small business full of people who aren't trained to be robotic clones like most of the chains.  Hence the portion sizes tend to be different from plate to plate, and the food is really inconsistent.    My personal opinion is that they're trying to do too much with what they have.  That said, I don't think what they ARE doing is bad, just not as good as it probably could be.  The prices were nothing special.  The service was nothing special.  The food was nothing special.  The cleanliness was nothing special.  The RESTAURANT itself was.... say it with me.... nothing special.  I'll probably not be back because there are 40 places like this between my house and their front door.  There was just nothing special to draw me here when I could get more or less the same thing from a million places.  That said, it's not bad and if you're in the neighborhood and craving diner food, give em a shot.  They won't disappoint you, and they won't blow you away."}
{"text":"Totin's is a cool little gem right at the edge of McCandless, tucked in right at the start of the flats towards Wexford.  It's clean, bright, got a really nice \"neo-classic diner\" vibe, decorated with nostalgia pieces and replica cars.  I like Totin's because it is not pretentious.  You've walked into a diner to eat and they feed you.  The food is good, hot, well-seasoned, well-portioned and priced right.  Like every good diner, they have breakfast, standard lunch items and comfort food.  Personally, I like their breakfast and they do this well.  Service is always good  Couple things that set Totin's apart are the flatscreen TVs on all the walls, each showing something different.  You can usually see at least 2 out of 3 TVs no matter where you sit."}
{"text":"An absolutely perfect example of how a diner should be. Quaint, well priced, good hours, friendly service, delicious food and nostalgic ambiance.  Portions are huge, waitresses are attentive and the restaurant is clean!  I went on St Patrick's Day and had the most incredible corned beef and cabbage I've ever had!  Meat was lean and flavorful. Veggies were fresh and amazing... A five star experience."}
{"text":"I stopped by here today with my father for lunch.  We have both been by this place numerous times before but have never made an effort to stop until today.  The inside of the restaurant is what you would expect out of a diner with lots of retro items including die cast cars and photos from the 50's as well as a number of booths and tables.  They also serve breakfast all day long.  The menu here isn't that large and I have to admit that I looked over it a number of times without really finding anything.  I eventually settled on the reuben sandwich with a side of pierogies while my did went with the titanic fish sandwich also with a side of pierogies.  Whenever the food arrived my dad's fish sandwich actually looked pretty comical.  The 1/2 pound of fish came on a bun the size a breakfast sandwich and was served with both buns facing upward and the fish stretching well past both, so pretty much as an open faced sandwich.  My dad did say that it was really good though with the breading being good but not overwhelming and that it was the best fish sandwich he has had in a long time.   My reuben didn't look nearly as impressive and combined with the 2 pierogies side, I did not think that I was going to have enough to eat.  How deceiving that was though as I left the place stuffed.  My reuben was pretty good with the requisite corned beef, sauerkraut and thousand island on some marble rye.  The pierogies were what really shined for me though.  They clearly were not Mrs. T's and if I had to guess, I would guess that were homemade due to the thinness of the dough.  That combined with a good amount of filling made for a really good pierogie.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While this place may be a little pricy compared to your traditional diner, I thought that all of the food was good and was impressed with the portion sizes."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, no complaints! I ordered french toast combo. Eggs were perfectly cooked. Hash browns yum! My husband got pot roast sandwich and it looked good too!"}
{"text":"I'm really impressed small loving family environment wait was not long waitress friendly very clean  love that they have TV to watch and a fun mat for the kids to keep them content and the goodies but oldies to rock to yes this is a great place food came fast and hot and pierogies to die for price with the servings size and they deliver"}
{"text":"This is the oddest place. High priced diner food but people love it. Maybe my wife and I got the wrong dish but it was very average. The price on the other hand was on par with a more traditional restaurant. I just don't get it."}
{"text":"The food isn't worth how you're treated by the staff. My fiance and I attempted to go for breakfast on a Saturday morning around 9:45.  He was picking his car up from a dealership just down the street while I went on to get a table. There was around a 10 minute wait.  I waited for my name to be called and was then seated.  After sitting down for a minute or so, a waitress walked by and told me if my whole party wasn't there I wasn't allowed to be seated. I told her my second person would be there any second and I was going to call to see how close he was.  She insisted again that I get out of the booth. As I was calling, she again told me numerous times that I needed to leave the booth.  I totally understand the concept of seating full parties in a restaurant that can get very very busy. However, I wasn't told that or asked if all of the people in my party were present until I had already been seated by someone on their staff.  At that point, the restaurant should take responsibility for their mistake, not kick me out of a booth I was already sitting in.  I left and took my business to Waffles Incaffeinated, who was more than happy to take my money, and by the time I drove the one driveway over, my fiance had arrived.  For a small establishment I was really disappointed in their lack of understanding they'd made the mistake in seating me in the first place."}
{"text":"We were in the area and looking for a quick lunch so we popped into Totin's Diner.  The place is small, but the decor is cute - like a 50's type diner!!  The portions are large.  I had the grilled cheese - lots of cheese.  We ordered a side of bacon - it was well cooked, but cold.  The coffee was good diner coffee - even gave us a full large to go cup when we left.  We also tried the cinnamon french toast - they give you 4 half pieces of bread - thick and was tasty.  All the wait staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Went here after taking the ACT. Food was amazing! Some of the best I've ever had. I got a chocolate milkshake to drink and a hot Turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes to eat. The milkshake was very big and filling. Very creamy and chocolatey! The service is so quick. It only took 6 or 7 minutes for my food to come out- and the restruant was pretty busy. The sandwich was made with real Turkey breast. And the mashed potatoes were in a smashed style- so you could tell they were real! The gravy topped it all off and it tasted wonderful. I am definitely going to come here again soon."}
{"text":"I've been here before. The food is good, and the service is usually fine. But today was completely different. My friend and I walked in, and instead of greeting us, the hostess carelessly pointed to a table. When we asked to sit outside, she asked one of the waitresses, \"Hey do you feel like goin outside today?\" And the waitress replied with, \"Not if I don't have to.\"  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! It is gorgeous outside. The sun is shining, and it's a beautiful 72 degrees. It's not like we were asking her to go into a hail storm.  Customer service was clearly not a priority today. Not only were we treated as unimportant, but we were also made to feel guilty and uncomfortable for even suggesting to be seated outside. We sat down at the table we were directed to (INSIDE) but decided to leave after a couple minutes. And we are now at the Pizza Hut down the street where customer service is a #1 priority."}
{"text":"came here while visiting my daughter that lives in Wexford.  we both had the debs cinnamon swirl French toast combo she had sausage.. very good  I had bacon .perogi was very good. .. we both wish we had just gotten the cinnamon swirl bread as it was AWESOME.... fast service. great food. came quick. lots of offer of coffee refill but were to busy eating to drink coffee. . reason I gave a 4 is it is a little pricy for breakfast food but will not keep me from coming back.. more things on the menu I want to try.."}
{"text":"Incredible! I loved the breakfast very well priced . My my daughter (7mos) here first pancake. Loved the pierogis , being from Chicago don't see them often on menus . Well priced good food if there is anything negative it would be the size of the restaurant in the small size, I would imagine weekends would incur long waits"}
{"text":"I frequent the Wexford area and everyday I would drive by Totin's Diner wanting to go in but never having the time. Friday morning I decided why not finally give it a try! As I walked in the atmosphere was most enjoyable with a 50's diner theme! Being that it was a Friday morning around 10 am I was quite surprised to see how crowded it was! I sat down and was immediately greeted by the waitress who got my coffee to me in less than 2 minutes of me arriving at the store. I ordered the Gyro omelette with an English muffin and fruit cup that was watermelon that day! I absolutely loved all components of the meal! I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of meat they put into the omelette and everything was seasoned beautifully! The prices were a little high but I didn't mind since I like to support small businesses. I would absolutely recommend this little diner when you feel like treating yourself to something different than a chain restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad breakfast or lunch at Totin's.  Seriously folks, I don't know what you expect from a Diner.  I live in Philadelphia, right over the border from New Jersey aka. The Land of Diners.  Totin's measures up to and even surpasses most NJ diners.    A few helpful guidelines... * Diners are great for breakfast and lunch * Diners are not known for their healthy fare * Diners do not serve fine cuisine  The ONLY change that I would make at Totin's is to switch from Pepsi to Coke products, but that's just a personal preference.  Also, brownie points for delivery service!"}
{"text":"Okay, went back today and I'm sorry to say we won't be back again. I really wanted to like it, but there were simply too many negatives. Let's start with standing at the entrance waiting to be seated...and waiting...and waiting. Nobody was in front of us, tables were available, a couple waitresses were in the area and not one of them even made eye contact. Okay, so it isn't the waitresses job....but couldn't someone have at least said the hostess would be with us in a moment?  Give us a smile?  Acknowledge our presence?  The capper was when one waitress pushed passed us and didn't even excuse herself...should have left then, but it was Saturday and time was awasting! That pretty much summed up breakfast...a waste of time and money.   Finally we were seated. The waitress disappeared. While waiting to place our order, there was plenty of time to check out some of the dishes at the neighboring tables...hmmm, lots of so-called homefries left on plates...hmmm, they did look kinda almost burned. The cinnamon French toast looked interesting...but my heart was set on a good, basic bacon and cheddar omelet...3-egg omelet the menu said...premium bacon the menu said.  Once the waitress showed up again that's what I ordered. My companion ordered an egg white veggie omelet with an English muffin. Both came with a side of homefries...well, eventually they showed up.    We waited over half an hour for omelets! And it wasn't busy! If these were the proclaimed 3-eggs,though, they must have been from the world's smallest chickens. The English muffin was some cheap tasteless off-brand wanna-be type. Well at least our homefries weren't burned...because they were undergone and totally bland.  A little secret here....judge a breakfast joint by their homefries...I do.  The menu even said the shredded potatoes were fresh....again, a waste.  A waste of a fresh potato!   All this for a whopping $18! One cup of coffee was included in that price.  Period.  Go to Denny's for better service and better food at a far better price. Like I said, a waste of time AND money!  Sorry Totain's...I WANTED to like you...."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite diner. It is clean, I love the 60s theme and all the staff are super friendly. The owner is extremely accommodating  as well. There are 4 tv's in the dinning room and everytime I've ever come in he has turned on cartoons on one of the tv's for my children without me even requesting. My grandma is first generation immigrant from Ukraine and she's the only person I know who can make pierogies the right way.... until I tried this place. Their pierogies are amazing as well as the rest of their food."}
{"text":"Yum! Cute homey diner atmosphere. Large menu full of everyday comfort foods. I could spend everyday here clogging my arteries with goodness.  Bonus- they deliver!!!"}
{"text":"Great selection of home cooked food Jim and the staff do an excellent job: service, preparation, portion size everything just right. You will not walk away hungry."}
{"text":"This diner is probably one of the cutest, coziest, and classic diners in Wexford. I would say it's definitely a local favorite. This place is always hopping during open business hours. And rightly so, it's absolutely delicious!   Upon entry, I first noticed all the fun memorabilia adorning the walls and close to every inch of this place. Cars, sports, and all of the above. Definitely gives Totin's a classic diner feel.   My friend and I came here on a Sunday morning for brunch... Totin's did not disappoint! After some debate, I ultimately decided to get the french toast. This french toast was probably the best french toast I've ever had. It was hot, had a crunchy outside, and a soft and fluffy inside. There was also cinnamon in the french toast, which was a delicious added bonus.  My friend had ordered an omelet, which I had a couple bites of and it, too, was very, very good!   Overall, this was an excellent stop for brunch! I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and staff was great! I ordered a veggie omelet and it was huge. Portions are big and you won't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"Went here on a rainy Saturday morning with my daughter for the first time. There were people waiting in the front and parking was a struggle. We waited about 15 minutes. Once we were seated a nice young waitress served us and took our orders and brought it out within 10 minutes. I had the farmers omelette with home fries, rye toast and a glass of orange juice. My daughter had the kids combo (scrambled eggs with bacon and toast). It was all fantastic. Definitely the best in the Wexford/north hills area. The waitress was very friendly. The bill came to $22 and I tipped $8. I gave 4 stars due to the long wait and parking difficulties. The restaurant population has outgrown the number of tables they have inside. I'll be back though for sure. Maybe for lunch next time."}
{"text":"10/10 this place has the best breakfast in the Pittsburgh area. Kelly-o's and Deluca's may have been on TV but Totins is a true hidden gem. Huge portions that are worth every penny. I highly recommend the French toast its life changing. Great staff, the owner works in the back and is very personable."}
{"text":"Totin's has very good food and great, fast service.  I eat there about every other week."}
{"text":"Gave Totin's another try since it gets rave reviews for their breakfast. The kids and husband enjoyed their meals, and I pretty happy with mine. (Everyone tried a bite of everything here!) Kudos to the chef/cook for expertly cooking the shredded hash browns and eggs. By far one of the better executed breakfast staples in the area.   I ordered Deb's Cinnamon Swirl French Toast. The eggs were a perfectly cooked over medium (as requested) which went well with the shredded hashbrown potatoes. This particular combo comes with two triangles of french toast made from a very lightly swirled cinnamon bread. I think there was more cinnamon flavor in the glaze than the bread, but everything was made better by adding some syrup. On top of the french toast, this combo comes with your choice of regular toast (wheat, rye, Italian, Texas etc.), which I could have done without. (Extra french toast would have been a great idea! Although I suppose you could do the Totin's Combo plus Deb's Cinnamon Swirl French Toast. The website says the combo I ordered should come with the same amount of just the entree of cinnamon swirl french toast.)  The kielbasa omelet was good, although the american cheese was a bit overwhelming. Perhaps less cheese, a sharper cheese, or provolone would be a better option. My husband really enjoyed the swirled rye bread paired with the apple butter packets available at the table.  Our entire family really liked the sausage, and preferred it much more than the bacon. Some bacon slices were cooked more than others, and others tasted like a piece of cooked ham rather than bacon. I know water is a funny thing to review, but the water tasted really good and I preferred it much more than the coffee.   The kids really liked the car decor, chocolate milk, pancake, and french toast portions of their breakfast."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast.  Had eggs over easy, sausage links, potatoes, & rye bread.  Very large portions.  Saw other dishes coming out...pancakes are huge and everything looked good.  Would recommend...will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try Totin's. Unfortunately was very disappointed. The service was terrible. The waitress seemed friendly at first, but when she made a mistake on my order she blamed it on me. She brought out the wrong food (okay fine, no problem, we all make mistakes). But instead she made me feel stupid saying what I thought I had ordered, didn't even exist. (And it does, I checked the menu again because she made me feel so dumb). I also heard her talking about me to one of her coworkers. Just felt extremely disrespected. She insisted that it was my fault. All she had to do was apologize for the mistake and fix it and I would not be writing this review. The food looked good, but I won't be back because I don't spend money places that makes their customers feel bad."}
{"text":"So so good. We had breakfast there... portions were huge. I got the hot sausage omelet and was NOT disappointed. Atmosphere is laid back. Dinner is BYOB. Service is always excellent."}
{"text":"Totin's Diner is definitely a diamond in the rough so to speak. It's super easy to miss if you aren't looking out for it. The diner came highly recommended and it definitely delivered. I'm glad we got there a little early and didn't have to wait too long but expect a longer than normal wait if you go on the weekend.  You get what you ask for. They have the \"classic\" diner feel with good (probably a little large) portion sizes, unlimited coffee and no frills. We were there for breakfast and let me tell you it definitely lived up to the recommendations. I went with the \"Little Al\" which featured sausage, a plate-sized pancake, two eggs and toast... and this was the smaller of the two \"Al\"s! I also got a side of biscuits and gravy because I had to try them! It definitely wasn't a side, more the size of a second meal so I really couldn't finish it, but we did split it with the table and everyone enjoyed it. The service was also great. Always helpful and always willing to make suggestions if need be.  If you're looking for a good diner in the Wexford/Cranberry/McCandless area, look no further than Totin's Diner. Just remember to give yourself some time to show up earlier as there can be a wait for breakfast."}
{"text":"I stopped in for breakfast and was craving French toast. Well that's what I got... Toast.  It was two slices of cinnamon toast warned on the grill, no egg batter. Tasty but rather tough and dry. So I got (2) slices of toast and a coffee.... Over $11.00 with tip. The other customers Food looked good , but I'm not ready to take out a loan for breakfast."}
{"text":"Good food and lots of options, but the waitresses never give or ask if you want coffee refills."}
{"text":"Me, my girlfriend, my brother and his wife all came here on a Wednesday morning for brunch, and it was delicious!  We all had some kind of omelet (I had the farmers, with more meat then I know what to do with) and it was very very good. My brother and his wife ordered a one off omelet that was not on the menu, and they had no problems with that either.   The only reason I am giving this place a 4, not a 5, is because my girlfriend likes to eat healthy and she ordered some weird veggie omelet with egg whites, and it came covered in butter, which I assume was used as a grease on the pan.  We strongly enjoyed this place, and will probably visit again..."}
{"text":"After coming here many times between my last review and now, I have to go with 5 stars. Dine in or take out, the service is always superb. Never had a bad meal either which is a good thing. Lol! No matter what I have had and what the hubby has had, they don't miss a beat. There is consistency in the food. Time after time, the food is consistently awesome. Breakfast food ,they have you covered in a big way. Their pancakes are my favorite, blueberries by the boat load. I love their sausage links, huge and a little spicy-delicious! I love the hashbrowns. They are a little greasy but not overly so, just perfect. I love their pierogies, yum! And their sandwiches are awesome too. I have had the turkey and it is divine!!! Just an awesome little place in the most awesome little building with the most awesome diner food and all around awesome service."}
{"text":"Totin's is a great place for a family meal. The food is so good...The fish dinner is exceptional. Warning...You will probably bring some home! The breakfasts are so good. The restaurant is  pretty small, and it's not really suited for a large party."}
{"text":"I stopped here on my way to the mall for a late breakfast. I loved the retro vintage look and feel it has. Perfect for car cruising.  I was told to have a seat anywhere. Breakfast is served all day and service is both good and fast. I was just shy of getting lunch but decided to go for an omelet. All omelets are made using 4 eggs. If you want egg whites then they are a $1.00 more.  I opted for an egg white omelet with vegetables. I didn't want the cheese since I knew that would be overfilling. You have a choice of a side which could either be hash browns or potato pancakes and toast. Yes you can get applesauce to go with the potato pancakes.  I had my food in about 5 minutes and believe me was it ever good! As I glanced at some of the other tables I noticed that portions are huge so I guarantee you that there is no way you will go home hungry. I saw that they do specialize in French onion soup which I'll try on a return visit. There is plenty of parking here but there is also a warning sign indicating that it is for customers only.   Located on the southbound side of Rt 19 before the split to McKnight Road I found it easier to get into the business from that side. Good food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Small place but big menu and huge servings.  They have a small waiting area, booths, pittsburgh decor, and 2 large TVs.  So far nothing on the menu has disappointed.  They have great omelettes. Even the cheese omelette is yummy.  Lots of cheese!  It's like eating a grilled cheese only with the scrambled eggs as the sandwich.    My faves are the steak and eggs for breakfast and the giant hot pot roast for lunch.  The homemade pot roast is served on breadworks bread and smothered with gravy!  Delicious!  In my tastebuds' opinion, they have the best hashbrowns.  I highly recommend this diner.  The reason why I had to subtract a star is because the service can be inconsistent.  The servers are really friendly but not too attentive."}
{"text":"This place is ok but the food is a little greasy, even for an American diner. The food is average. Service is outstanding though. Very quick and helpful."}
{"text":"I ordered their 56 oz prime rib medium rare for take out. They cooked it perfectly. The entire steak melted in my mouth. I was able to cut it into 4 very generous portions for my entire family. The natural graveyard was very good as well. If you are a steak person do not pass this up."}
{"text":"Wonderful diner food. The diner feels like it transports you straight to the 50s. Good food for breakfast and dinner. Only downside is that it seems slightly dirty, but is worth the food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Totin's for breakfast!  It's been a long time since I've loved a place this much for breakfast (RIP Jojo's Diner and Quiet Storm)!  The first time that I went here was when I was waiting for my car to be serviced at the nearby Ford dealership and they recommended Totin's as a good place for breakfast, and I fell in love with it!  Granted, my boyfriend and I have only had breakfast here three times so far, but each time we really enjoyed it!  One our first visit I had the Florentine Omelet, the second visit I had Deb's Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Combo, and on our most recent visit I had the Bacon Cheddar Omelet.  My partner had the Big Al on all three visits because he always had leftover pancakes (chocolate chip) to take home!  I love that they have marble rye as one of the options, and their breakfast sausage is to die for, and you won't usually find me eating sausage, but theirs is delicious!  I feel that the prices are reasonable given the large quantity of food that you get for the money, but again, I can only speak to their breakfast portions.    I love the atmosphere and decor - the place gets a little noisy, but it's not overwhelming.  The service staff with whom I've interacted have been friendly and attentive even when we went on a busy Sunday morning!  I can't wait to go back to Totin's again for breakfast - I've already promised one of my friends that I would take her there for breakfast soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday morning around 8:30 am and was seated immediately in a booth. The restaurant has a retro look with a car theme. The food is good. I had the Deb combo 2 eggs, your choice of toast, bacon or sausage, your choice of potatoes,cinnamon french toast. You won't leave hungry. Server was great as was the coffee which was kept filled. I'm going to return to Totins. Plenty of parking. Clientele was a mixture of businessmen, famlies, tradesmen, seniors, couples. They have booths and counter seating. Waiting time to get a seat moves pretty fast, especially for a Friday morning."}
