{"text":"Great tacos and burritos, but HORRIBLE, I repeat, HORRIBLE, delivery service. So bad, I can't deal with ordering from them anymore."}
{"text":"It was really good! We got this delivered and I got a chicken quesadilla and my fianc√© got some kind of chicken sandwich, I forgot what it was called. The entrees were great. I was disappointed with the empanadas though. We got those as an appetizer.  I LOVE empanadas but these tasted strange to me, not like empanadas I've had other places. But the entrees were really good and that matters most."}
{"text":"Horrible delivery service. Took about 2 hours and 2 calls from the driver for directions to my house. Everything was ice cold and my burger was nasty cold mush. Not bright ordering a burger for delivery, I know. But I can go pickup a burger & get it home while still edible. Wouldn't order delivery from here again. Can't really rate the food. Was cold and sucked.  My order was around 7-8pm on a weekday so definitely after any dinner rush possibility."}
{"text":"The food is definitely good. I'm from the DMV and I've had plenty of Peruvian chicken, and AJ's compares. Only thing is the portion sizes are small. I ordered the quarter chicken, with 2 sides. The \"quarter\" chicken (leg and thigh) was about 2\"x2\", and I was only given 4 plantains. I did have a decent amount of Yuca fries, though.  Also delivery was faster than expected. About 10 minutes earlier than estimated."}
{"text":"I really recommend this place if you are ever craving.... anything. You can get spaghetti or Russian salad or burritos or a single fried egg if that's what moves you. Great hangover cure, great hunger cure. Delicious Peruvian sodas and ... just... amazing! Eat here!"}
{"text":"I was craving Peruvian chicken so badly. Since I'm from Philly we have a ton more options and variety there! The food is always delicious and definitely authentic! So anyway I thought I'd try this one out and at first it was meh alright for an Oakland restaurant. So we went again and the chicken was as dry as a prune and tasted old. The tables are pretty sticky and dusty. Being Latina this is not even close to the real Peruvian chicken or cuisine. We went there again and the service was absolutely terrible we didn't get the green sauce which we mainly used to drown the food in it so it would taste better. But we didn't get a bottle instead we just got a tiny little plastic cup which was rude bcs we asked if we could please have a bottle, multiple times. Not worth the prices and honestly just save yourself don't eat here."}
{"text":"This is a review of the delivery service, not sure how the food is because after two hours it has not arrived..."}
{"text":"We had a great time at this brand new restaurant in South Oakland. While there is a variety of burgers and subs, I would recommend going with the Peruvian menu.   I had the Pollo A Lo Pobre, a quarter chicken with 2 fried eggs (so you don't have to decide which came first). The chicken was seasoned to perfection, not too bland and not too spicy. The white rice was good and it came with plantains which were also prepared very well. My wife had Chicken Saltado, which she enjoyed very much.   I have high hopes for this place and hope people will come out and support it. It is relatively inexpensive, especially considering what you get for your money. The staff is friendly and efficient. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I visited AJ's with a couple of friends for dinner last Sat.  We were looking for a place to have dinner in Oakland that offered interesting food and that we hadn't tried, and AJ's fit the bill.  This restaurant is a bit off the beaten path, which may explain why we were the only diners at the time of our visit--they appear to do most of their business through GrubHub.  Because we're adventurous eaters, all of us eschewed the American options to order the Peruvian 1/4 rotisserie chicken combo ($7.49).  Each of us got different sides--I ordered Yucca fries ($1 upcharge) and plantains, one friend ordered Peruvian rice and plantains, and another ordered pinto beans and salad.  Additionally, my friends both ordered the chicha morada ($2.35).  The chicken consisted of white meat, and had a nice caramelized skin and moist interior, as I've come to expect from Peruvian rotisserie chicken.  The Yucca fries were starchy and a bit bland (adding some salt helped), and the plantains were a bit mushier than I'd like.  I didn't try my friends' sides, but they seemed happy with them.  The chicha morada comes in a bottle, as indicated on the menu. I did try a sip of it, and it had a nice flavor with hints of spices.  Overall, we were quite pleased with our experience at AJ's.  If it's lunchtime and dinnertime and you're in Oakland and you don't feel like hightailing it to the Strip for Peruvian chicken, AJ's is a nice alternative.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"If you are tired of the same old take out/delivery in the city, consider AJ's.  Working in Oakland you seem to have the option of the same thing at every establishment.  I was tired of that and somehow I stumbled upon this place.  Glad I did.  At first, you think to yourself how to burgers and Peruvian rotisserie chicken really get paired up?  I know I did.  I was really in the mood for a burger and with burger being the moniker I thought that this can't be all that bad.  Compared to all the other places that offer burgers, this is leaps and bounds above what has somehow become the standard for burgers offered.  When you order you think that you are going to get one of those pre-made, frozen patties that are void of flavor.  Not here, you get two patties that are fresh made of beef and full of flavor.  This thing looks monstrous, but manageable at the same time.  You get the choice of what you want on top of it.  I picked some old faithfuls: lettuce, onions, pickles and mayo.  By the time you finish this thing, you will be a mess, but a satisfied mess."}
{"text":"Their empanadas were absolutely amazing! They were only 3.50 a piece and were more than enough food. My friend and I ended up getting 3 and they were more than enough for the price we paid. This place is great and a great price as well. Anyone living in Oakland should check this food out because it is delicious and fast and just on Semple!"}
{"text":"I love this place, they have great burgers and are nice people. Food is really tasty. I always ordered ahead and picked up and they were pretty quick about things. The chicken is a little on the dry side but I liked the flavor."}
{"text":"Who would have thought to find Peruvian chicken and dishes in this unassuming place in this part of Oakland? It's certainly easier to get here than Chicken Latino if you're in the east end though, and I found the chicken here to be just fine. It's nothing like Boston Market or Costco's rotisserie; I was able to taste some of the spices infused into the meat that would not be in your typical American version. The prices were reasonable, and a quarter chicken combo was enough for one person. You get a choice of dark or white meat, and I found the dark meat to be very tender. For the sides, both the salad and fries were just fine. Service was decent; it was pretty clear they do a lot of take-out and delivery with orders coming and going, but they have some tables for eating in too.  I am actually more interested in their non-chicken Peruvian dishes, some of which Chicken Latino only serves on weekends. So all the more reason to come check this place out."}
{"text":"Passable food. Maybe even good food. But the matriarch hostess was rude to point of absurdity. As a paying customer, I expect reasonably prompt service, but I was disappointed to find that AJ's workers would rather babble on about the latest soap opera then service a paying customer. I'm hesitant to step foot in the joint again. 2/5 clams. - TV"}
{"text":"This is some of the best food I have had in Pittsburgh. The portion size was very generous and the authenticity of the Peruvian Cuisine exquisite. I am happy to say that AJ's now has a new regular customer. I would highly recommend this fine dining establishment to anyone, especially someone looking for something new and exciting."}
{"text":"Wow! So I ordered AJ's on Grubhub the other day and I am truly upset with myself that I have held off for so long. I've read the reviews and  the sounded good and the pictures looked tasty. However, I guess I was just surprised at how little feedback there is regarding the restaurant. Well, I tried it and loved it! I am very health conscious and it can be a slippery slope when you want to not eat super heavy foods but you also do not want to cook. The roasted chicken was super juicy and flavorful! I also really liked the sauce that it came with! It's a creamy, spicy, green sauce that is yummy and herbaceous! Along with the chicken I got two sides, rice and beans, and a chicken empanada. The rice was just white rice and I didn't eat much of it, because I felt like the other accompaniments were more appealing. The beans  were very flavorful! My favorite part though, may have been the empanada. The dough was flaky and perfect. Not too dense and the filling was really flavorful. Plus, olives! The only think I wasn't too crazy about was a cheese sauce that I was curious about trying. It wasn't very exciting and the next time I order, I will probably just get two of the hot sauces. I think I also got all of that for $15 including my 20% tip. Like...dang. I don't even know if I will order in anywhere else again!"}
{"text":"went there for lunch - ate in the restaurant. the food was fine - nothing special. I had the 1/4 chicken with pinto beans and rice - rather average and forgettable. unlikely to come back."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! Food is made fresh and from scratch. Me and my girlfriend had an awesome time here. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Food poisoning. Got tacos from them earlier today. Been vomiting over my toilet all day and my stomach is in extremely painful knots. Severe dehydration. Used to go a lot will never return"}
{"text":"Food is great.  Delivery service leaves something to be desired.  Took more than 90 minutes to get delivered when quoted by Yelp at 60 minutes."}
{"text":"It's decent, but it didn't have ceviche (my favorite Peruvian dish)."}
{"text":"I love Peruvian chicken. There aren't many places in Pittsburgh that have them. I found this place and chicken Latino down in strip district so far. I like chicken Latino better because, first it is way cheaper. Second, they are more generous with their cilantro mayo sauce. Those thing is crack!!   Anyway, enough about the comparison. AJ burger and rotisserie chicken is delicious. I love their yucca fries with the cilantro sauce. I can eat it all day everyday. I have never eaten there before, I always got delivery. They're pretty good, my only complaint is that they charge extra for the cilantro sauce. I would get it a lot more if it's cheaper."}
{"text":"First of all the owners and staff are super nice. But the food, oh my it's so good.  Burgers, empanadas, tacos are amazing. Plantains are crisp and tasty. Yucca fries put my head in the clouds with their goodness.  But the Peruvian chicken... You guys it's like one of those out-of-body experiences. So juicy and tender. In addition to visiting the restaurant I've used them several times for delivery and it can take awhile so be prepared. I say the wait is worth it because the food arrives as though you're eating it fresh at the restaurant."}
