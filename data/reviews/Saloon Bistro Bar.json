{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my experience here ;]]. My friends and I were trying to find a place to eat with good atmosphere, food, and drinks--this place had it all.  My food was good and came out quicker than most of the restaurants I've been to in Montreal so far. It is a bit overpriced [hence no 5 star], but their hot-as-fux male waitstaff more than made up for it. Very nice and responsive and HOT.  Would come back for the eyed candies any effing day.  ^_^v"}
{"text":"I must admit I LOVE LOVE LOVE Saloon. Ok, I might be a very gay man with a very gay boyfriend but I just LOVE Saloon Bistro! Nestled in between Priape (gay man's superstore), UNITY (gay hotspot), and other cute little restaurants (most of which are independent non-chainy operations) Saloon caters to the gay men and lesbians of Montreal, and their fabulous friends. This is probably the 'gayest' restaurant in Montreal--although the Village Diner down the street gives it a run for its money. The decor is really on point and trendy, perfect for a design conscious gay man like myself (ha!). The food is also scrumptious, best described as 'Canadian comfort food,' with a healthy selection of unique burger creations and other filling options like pasta with a Montreal twist. My boyfriend had the Chicken tempura burger which was so delicious! The chicken breast itself was actually tempura-ed! How fun! I had the 'mec' burger--for all you non-francophones mec means like 'dude' or 'guy' in French--so I felt a little manly eating this burger... only a little, lets not get carried away... as it had a nice big helping of 1/4 pound of beef topped with caramelized onions, lettuce, cheese, and 'secret sauce' which I think was a mix between spicy mayo and 1000 Islands salad dressing. Nonetheless it was really tasty. Like most places in Montreal the fries were great. I love Montreal fries, they're all 'frites'-style which I love. 

I mean the real reason people go here is not for the food--even though it is good--but rather because its surrounded by other fab gay guys. I saw perhaps one of the hunkiest guys I've seen in a long time sitting next to me (and my boyfriend, woops! shouldn't be looking ;)). And its clear that many people come here for the people-watching and eye-candy. But it is definitely not a pick-up joint if thats what you're thinking. There is no 'tunnel' downstairs or 'black room' in back, keep it clean people. Le Parking is down the street for that sort of thing! But there is nothing better than a 'gay' restaurant that gets it right. Too often all these gay restaurants just hope the patrons will flock to it because its in the Village. But as other restaurants in Toronto's 'Church and Wellesley' neighbourhood has shown, just because your gay doesn't mean your fabulous. Good job to Saloon who have been able to make it work for nearly a decade. 

American gays: come here to experience Montreal's gay scene. Straights: fear not we do not bite ... hard."}
{"text":"Accueillis par un serveur qui ne comprenait pas le français, mon ami s'est fait arrosé d'huile par une assiette volante et ils ne nous ont même pas offert un verre ou le repas. La taille du tartare a d'ailleurs bien réduis au fil des mois. Bref, nous irons prendre nos habitudes ailleurs."}
{"text":"This was the first time I came to this place at night and it was a crapshoot. We waited a good five minutes to be seated, another twenty to get an English menu for my anglo only friend and all of it came with reprehensible attitude. They can't command their price premium with service like this."}
{"text":"When making a reservation we were forced to use a \"group menu\" with about one third of the choices, and only the plain ones.  When we asked to use the full menu we were denied.

The food was not that appetizing and it took three attempts to manage to cook a steak to well done."}
{"text":"Une des meilleures adresses du village, menu varié, ambiance toujours au rendez-vous, bon service... Une formule gagnante!"}
{"text":"This place is just highly over rated! Really! The food is mediocre, drinks are weak, obnoxiously loud without reason, over staffed and slow service. Lets not forget the over priced tag that comes with all the above mentioned. It's unfortunate that my fellow queers are mesmerized by flashy objects and lights - as this is the only appeal to this place that I can see. Do yourself a favor and use Yelp as it was intended and find yourself a better restaurant."}
{"text":"things i hate about brunch in nyc:  long waits.  loud crowds.  slow service.  depending where you go, it can be sceney when it's way too early for that garbage (yes, even 2:00pm is too early) the worst part for me overall is that it's almost like a competition where all of the competitors are hung over.

what i love about brunch in montreal:  it exists in almost some kind of parallel universe where:  there are short or no waits (even for the great spots, like this one).  people talk but aren't all raising their voices to be heard over the next table.  the service (well, that's still a little bit on the slow side.) not sceney in the least.

now, let's get on to more important matters:  eggs benedict

le saloon has a page on their brunch menu DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO EGGS BENEDICT!  if your ears just pricked up, then maybe you're an eggs benedict freak (like me!)  there were about 15 different kinds to order from.  fifteen different kinds of eggs benedict!  i picked the one that sounded like it just wouldn't work because sometimes gambling with your food pays off.

i had the one named after the restaurant and it contained green onions, cream cheese, walnuts, goat cheese and fried mushrooms on a house made english muffin.  sometimes gambling with your food REALLY pays off.  this easily would be in my top three eggs benedict experiences (yes, i've thought about this..)

the fruit that they put on your plate isn't ripe (except for the grapes.)  was this for decoration?  who cares, i'm eating eggs benedict.  the little squares of hash browns were better but who cares?  i have EGGS BENEDICT!!

at night this is a bar / lounge / nightclub.  i didn't check it out but heard from a local the cocktails are good.  whatever, just keep feeding me breakfast."}
{"text":"Très bonne accueil l équipe et sympa la nourriture aussi et la musique également rien a dire de plus bonne adresse"}
{"text":"I had the chicken sandwich and it was AMAZING. So tasty and fresh. Also had the sangria and wow! Very refreshing. Super friendly service and great music. Amazing for a summer night. Only been in Montreal in the summer"}
{"text":"This was our first bar to visit during our stay in Montreal.  The place looks small from the outside, but once inside, you see they have a bar in the back area and a second floor for dining.

We stopped in for a few drinks prior to exploring Rue St. Catherine.  The bartender, Kevin, was excellent.  The entire staff was very friendly.  Hey, its Canada.  We ordered a side of Poutine (French Fries, Gravy and Cheese - a Canadian favorite).  The serving was huge for a side order and they were very good - 1 side order is enough for 2 people.  

The experience at the Saloon for a late afternoon drink and a bite to eat was very good.  People were actively talking amongst themselves and the atmosphere was lively.  The bartender was talkative and eager to help with suggestions of what to see and do while we were in town.

The cocktails are poured with a measured pouring device, as it was at every bar we visited on Rue Catherine.  So, the drinks were kind of weak to my liking, but I guess I could have order doubles.  The Sangria was very tasty.  Most patrons were drinking beers and wines.  Every employee we encountered spoke French and English.

The service, food and atmosphere here was great, and that is what makes us go back to bars again and again.  We will be back for sure on our next visit to Canada."}
{"text":"We were seated on the patio at Saloon, which gave us an opportunity to watch the diverse sidewalk traffic of Montreal's gay neighbourhood.  The food was good.  Jason and I shared calamari and shrimp appys.  He had steak et frites for dinner and I had penne putanesca.
The serving staff were charming and attentive."}
{"text":"Staff is very nice.  Food is very pricey for what it is.  \"happy hour\" prices are a joke.  been there twice.  First time was ok and I thought I would give it another try.  Never again....."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, the drinks were strong, the waiters were all gay and gorgeous. My friend and I stumbled upon this place our first night in Montreal and our waiter was extremely friendly and suggested all the places to go. It was a great start to one of the best vacations I've been on. Every time I am back in Montreal I am sure to come here to eat. 

It's really nice in the warm months too when outdoor seating is available."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Brunch during Pride. Our waiter was really nice, and the atmosphere was a blast.  Considering they are known for being a bar, the food was decent, lots of choice.  Patio is beautiful and they have an English menu and a list of cocktails including mimosas and ceasers.  Good times and lots of fun happening in the streets!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here!  Was greeted warmly soon as I opened the door and seated right away downstairs.  It was a Tuesday night, the tables were about 1/3 full, and my server came over promptly with two menus:  On top was a single page white laminated English menu, and beneath was long tri-fold menu that also appeared to be in English.  

I ordered the grilled salmon with sea salt, Yukon gold mashed potatoes, sautéed vegetables, and extra virgin olive oil along with a Guinness to drink.  Beer came quickly, tasted great, may have been draft.  My entree followed soon, was cooked just as ordered and tasted delicious.  I asked about dessert and picked a chocolate cake, it was layered with a cream mousse and outer chocolate shell.  The mousse was a little rich for me, but overall was tasty and satisfied my inner chocolate craving.  

I wanted to use up my Canadian money since my flight back to the States was next day, and paid with a combination of cash and credit card with no problem at all.  Having read some of the reviews below, I can only say that if there was a problem with tourists being treated differently, it seems to have been thoroughly addressed and resolved.  I almost didn't eat here after reading some negative reviews, but was glad that I did!  

Very pleasant experience overall, nice atmosphere and attentive service.  Also the most handsome bar and wait staff out of all the restaurants I visited in Montreal, although that wasn't my primary reason for visiting!  My server suggested coming back on a weekend, as they have a live DJ and the atmosphere is more lively, so I'll keep that in mind for next time.  

Merci beaucoup!"}
{"text":"My first meal in Montreal (Sunday brunch) and the saloon provided me a great experience.  Had a omelette- fresh, tasty and it came with many extras. Loved the fresh fruit salad and blueberry muffin.  Will return for lunch or dinner before i leave!"}
{"text":"I had the burget and it was OK. Found it a bit dry, but still overall tasty. The calamari was good and a large portion.

I do not recommend the poutine. The gravy ruined it."}
{"text":"We were greeted at Saloon, and were seated with the English menus. No questions asked. 

Our waiter was nice, attentive, and pointed out any extras that increased the price. This was my last meal in Montreal (brunch), and I went hard. I had the cowboy burger, poutine, and a pint of beer. All were really tasty, especially the burger patty.

My favorite part about Saloon is the atmosphere. It's open for brunch quite early on the weekends, but looks like you're eating eggs in the middle of a club. Love the disco ball above the bar and stallions on the walls"}
{"text":"Well what do you say, it is always hopping,,,,burgers and salads...FRESH, obviously high food turnover, the place is usually packed.  I personally don't see what the hype is ???? Fast, easy, casual.....good service...it gets my vote."}
{"text":"Situé dans le quartier gay et lesbien de Montréal, le Saloon est connu pour ses bonnes formules de brunch. A l'intérieur d'une vaste salle haute sous plafond avec un bar illuminé et coloré, on y trouve une bonne capacité d'accueil enrichie par une grande mezzanine. Ceci dit, ce matin de semaine, il n'y avait pas foule; c'est certainement le soir que ce lieu doit se remplir un peu plus.

Étant donné que midi était déjà passé et que je n'avais encore rien avalé, j'avais tellement faim que j'ai failli manger le menu plutôt que les plats inscrits sur celui-ci. Ce n'est pas sans compter sur ma patience que j'ai finalement décidé de prendre une formule bien complète: \"L'homme\" ! Celle ci est réservée aux appétits costauds puisqu'elle est composée d'une bonne bavette de 200g, d'ufs brouillés, de fruits frais, de fèves, de pommes rôties et de tartines de pain..... rien que ça.

Ajoutez y un mimosa ou un café bailey et vous serez pleinement satisfait ! Le service est très bien exécuté et les tarifs corrects. Un bon spot à brunch avec tout un tas de formules dont certains noms peuvent prêter à sourire...."}
{"text":"Came Friday night which was the beginning of pride weekend! Super busy as it should be with no places on the terasse to eat and drink. Grabbed a spot by the bar it was
Very loud due to the crazy amount of people that were swarming the place.

Drink special 4-7 got there at 6 so we did the adult thing and ordered a bunch of drinks before 7. Drinks were $7.00 instead of $10.00 but once u make it a double the deals out the window lol. Grumpy pappi, Montreal iced tea.

Food was okay not the best appetizers I've had but I know they can do a good job. Nachos need to be layered as the cheese is just on top. The duck wings are very greasy but that's pretty much duck for you. They weren't that warm this time which was a bummer not the same great experience as last time. 

They have a DJ spinning right beside the bathroom you might miss it as it's under the balcony. 

One of the owners or manager was very sweet brought us vanilla and espresso shots very delicious even tho I hate espresso lol.

Before leaving they had pride freebies which were sponsored by barefoot and absolute ( keychain, rubber bracelet, sunglasses) 

Love this place I will be back just gotta come early"}
{"text":"Nous sommes allées au Saloon dimanche pour le brunch entre copines.
La réservation était bien faite, nous avions une table prête, et le service était très bon.
Le choix du menu brunch est diversifié. Il y plein de choses qui ont l'air très bonnes!!
Petite déception, les portions ne sont pas très grosses.. Peu de patates et de fruits.. Par contre, il y avait un petit muffin en chocolat dans chaque assiette, super bon et très agréable en fin de repas en guise de dessert! :)
A essayer!"}
{"text":"Totally a cool space!
Love the ambience, great drink menu, friendly service.
I arrived at about 10:45 PM on a Saturday expecting to be able to order food... Kitchen closed. But still had a great time. Stayed past last call. I will come again.

Came again Sunday for dinner (alone). Saloon burger with fries. 
The bartender remembered me from last night and came to my table to greet me. Friendly place. 
I changed to five stars.  ;-)"}
{"text":"It's a fun atmosphere but the service was pretty terrible. It took almost 15 minutes for the server to visit my table and then somehow my entree came out before my drink. It was not an enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"The Bloody Mary is the alpha and omega of morning cocktails. If you order one here, I highly doubt that you'll be disappointed. The eggs Benedict is also a good choice. You need to get to Montreal."}
{"text":"Envi de manger sans parler? C'est l'endroit! Profiter de la musique de calibre rave avec les 587dB que génère la musique de ce restaurant! Bon service mais j'ai pas aimé particulièrement mon repas (pâtes avec des tomates âpretés d'une manière que je n'ai pas encore comprise aujourd'hui). Je le déconseille a un maximum de personnes juste pour le son que génère ce bistro/bar. Félicitation quand même pour le beau décor et l'énorme projection qui donne vraiment du style! Baissez le son et je donne une étoile!"}
{"text":"Un brunch très moyen ! Le plat \"petits fruits\" composé de crêpe au sirop d'érable et de fruit se révèle être deux crêpes pleine de confiture de fraise et de yaourt avec une coupelle de 10 raisins et du melon :-/ aucun jus/cocktail/smoothie n'est fait sur place et presque tous sont à base de sirop et d'eau !  Serveurs agréables et efficaces. Une ambiance sympa mais aucun intérêt gustatif."}
{"text":"Last night I enjoyed a break from freezing rain and snow at this restaurant bar. I tried the sweet potato french fries and a quite excellent burger. The beef here in Canada is quite amazing. 
My server spoke excellent fluent English and was quite pleasant when I tried with my limited French."}
{"text":"Best Poutine in the entire city! I know this will be challenged immensely. Know that I am the poutine master of all time and know the finer points of each ingredient. This place hands down has perfected this savory, salty, starchy dish of goodness. fresh cut fries, fresh salty cheese curds and a gravy so savory with chucks of meat that you pour over the dish when you're ready. We went back 3 times......"}
{"text":"Nice place but the music is so loud it's impossible to carry on a conversation across the table. Food also took a very long time to be served, when the restaurant was 1/3rd full."}
{"text":"1st time in Montreal on vacation!  Walked
Into this amazing place. Great food! Great ambiance! Fantastic music...all around great way to end a cold snowy day!"}
{"text":"I came here on a rainy night completely soaked, and arrived in a comically pathetic fashion. They seated us immediately and grabbed a bunch of paper towels from the bathroom so we could dry off. The ambience is interesting, and reminded me of a lot of the lounges in LA. In any case, it was a fun crowd, as there was a birthday party along the bar in the back. Our dinner was interrupted periodically by rounds of cheers to tequila shots, which was kind of funny.

There was also a second floor, I believe for private functions.

In any case, we got:

1. El paso burger: Pretty good. The burger was honestly a bit dry, but the rest of the ingredients was good. I was actually expecting an avocado in the burger, but didn't think I got one. I also upgraded the fries to the Caesar salad. I couldn't read French so thought the side salad was in addition to fries for $2. However, it's a substitute. 

2. Club saloon sandwich: I really liked this sandwich. Flavorful and satisfying. It came with a bowl of really really good fries in a garlic mayo sauce, which they seem to like in Canada instead of Ketchup.

Prices were average to high for burgers, but you're paying for the interesting atmosphere in a part of town convenient for nightlife post-dinner."}
{"text":"J'adore le Saloon, que ce soit pour un verre, dîner, souper...il y a toujours quelquechose d'intéressant à trouver au menu.

Et j'adore leur petit deuxième étage!

Un must sur la liste des restos à revisiter!

---

I love Le Saloon, whether it is for a drink, lunch or diner...there is always interesting to find on the menu.

And love their second floor!

A must on the list of restos to revisit!"}
{"text":"Came here after searching for a restaurant that was open on New Years Day. It looked poppin' so we gave it a try. The service was quick and the waiter was really nice. 

I had the onion soup which was loaded with cheese. Like serious cheese. By the end of my meal I had a huge chunk of cheese left over because there was much more cheese than soup itself. I also ordered dumplings and the panko shrimp. Those were just okay. 

I definitely feel like this place is a bit overpriced. The food is decent and so is the service. The atmosphere is really an experience though. Also the restroom is smaller than an airplane bathroom so be aware of that when you go."}
{"text":"Definitely a top choice when visiting Montreal's gay village!  My friends and I make at least one visit here on each trip!  Their brunch is TO DIE FOR - and their champagne cocktail menu has flavors I never expected!  I had a white cranberry mimosa and couldn't get enough of it!! DELICIOUS!  Staff is always very friendly and bilingual!  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Had a great Sunday brunch as a heterosexual couple, at the bar. The bar server was such an eye candy, and also very efficient waiter. 

Breakfast hamburger has a very pretty presentation. 

Nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Ça fait quelques semaines que j'y suis allée avec des amies...et j'ai de la difficulté à me souvenir des plats que j'ai pris...cuisine qui ne m'a pas marqué
Tartare: bien ordinaire...voire sans goût. 
Je me souviens d'avoir payé cher pour un souper des plus ordinaires.
Service: rapide et sympathique
Ambiance: de bistro et accueillante"}
{"text":"Great place! There's a fun hip vibe around the room. 

The service was attentive and friendly. The pitcher of sangria was really tasty. The menu offers something for everyone. I wanted to try a few things and settled for the club sandwich. 

If I have to complain it will be about the genius cook who decided it was ok to use stale rye bread to hold a giant sandwich together. Within a minute my first piece disintegrated in my hand. The bottom fell right out and I was left with a handful of chicken, tomato, bacon, and mayo in my hand. Bread all over my pants. The waiter was nice enough to have the remainder rebuilt with a hamburger bread. 

Despite this I gave it 4 stars and will certainly go back."}
{"text":"Had my 30th here and it was great. Was a nice classy place with good food and drinks at reasonable prices. Atmosphere was great where everyone felt at easy. Classy place!"}
{"text":"Only had dinner once here and i friggin' died over the Iceberg Salad with blue cheese. It's seriously so good. Once of the best salads i've ever had. 

Ambiance is cool, loud house music, amazing sangrias. In the summer there's an outdoor patio where i've had drinks before. Fun spot."}
{"text":"Je suis aller mangé un midi avec des amis et les burger que nous avons pris était sec malheureusement. 

La quiche avait l'air bonne mais sans plus. 

Les frites de patates douces quand à elle étaient bonnes (rajouter un supplément pour ces frites).

Sinon personnel sympa"}
{"text":"Bon service et bonne ambiance. La nourriture est succulente et les portions sont généreuses. Le rapport qualité prix est excellent. Par contre, il faut aimer la musique forte et le fait que le monde parle fort pour pouvoir bien s'entendre. Ce qui est original, c'est que la musique est produite directement par un DJ sur place. Ah oui, faut pas avoir peur de se coller sur son voisin de table. Dison que la place est très populaire et que l'espace n'est pas suffisant pour la popularité de l'endroit. Mais en bout de ligne, les petits inconvénients s'oublient en recevant les délicieux plats commandés."}
{"text":"I hate to pigeon-hole an establishment by saying they cater to a certain demographic.  But Le Saloon Bistro Bar is without a doubt, gay.  How gay, you ask?  My first visit to Saloon, I was the only heterosexual male in the entire (full) restaurant.  My friend was the only girl.  We sat down, and the guy sitting next to us leaned over and asked, \"Did you kids get lost?\"

That being sad, Le Saloon is hands down my favorite brunch in Montreal.  It's lively, friendly, trendy and chic.  The food is French influenced cuisine with American sized portions.

The menu is impressive.  A page of exotic juices and smoothies.  Crepes and salads.  An entire page dedicated to Eggs Benedict.   And of course, the typical eggs and omelets.

I'd highly recommend the Parisian Eggs Benedict, but be sure to order the hollandaise sauce on the side - it can be a bit overwhelming. 

The fresh fruit can be hit or miss.  Sometimes the grapes and melon look a little old.  But another time I found my plate garnished with exotic Golden Berries (from Marche Atwater) - awesome!

And the potatoes are hands down the best I've ever had.

I'd highly recommend Le Saloon - you'll definitely find me back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant scored pretty well on TripAdvisor so we gave it a shot. The extensive cocktail menu was impressive and a good way to start off the meal. We loved the Pogos for appetizers - it was so good we ended up ordering two of them! I ordered the main course sized
Steak tartare which was pretty good - not spectacular, and not too large either. I actually wonder how small the appetizer portion would have been. If you can get a seat on the patio it's a perfect space for people watching as folks lounge down Ste Catherine. The public space across the street also had a street piano so if you're lucky you get the occasional live performance"}
{"text":"Came here with the conference people...not a bad place in the heart of the gay village.  Bit warm upstairs."}
{"text":"We visit Montreal annually and we always visit Le Saloon. The food is always well prepared. The staff is very attentive. And theye always have a lovely and affordable selection of wines."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant/bar in the gay village. The food is good, love the atmosphere and the music. Reminds me of NYC."}
{"text":"Overprice and Overrated
I was here on a Friday for lunch. The service was abnormally slow as it took the waiter over half hour to bring us our drinks.  
The nachos were worse than the ones at Kelsey's - barley any cheddar cheese
The drinks were weak and the fries were super, super greasy!
I will never go here again!"}
{"text":"Great place for 3 girls to get their night started on the right foot- techno beats, great drinks, and lots of cute boys to look but not touch.  Why not touch? because most of them appead to not swing our way. (Catch my drift)

Extensive menu of yummy food and drinks and quick friendly service.

LOVE!"}
{"text":"Cool restaurant in the heart of \"The Village\". I had a great experience, and would recommend it to adults. You can have great fun especially during the summer."}
{"text":"Ambiance agréable et branchée. 
Repas servis rapidement et le service est sympathique!"}
{"text":"Food was great, atmopshere is really nice too.  Service was a little slow but it was a busy night."}
{"text":"What a fun place to enjoy a burger with good friends. The service was really slow though. If you plan on having more than one drink you should probably order all of them at once, it just takes way too long. 

The food, however, was pretty good. I had a bleu cheese burger and fries, served on a slab of wood which made eating a little awkward but was pretty cute.

The atmosphere is very fun yet relaxing at the same time, kind of glad we sat inside!"}
{"text":"I ordered a berries crepe and it came filled with 90% Greek yogurt and a tiny bit of jam and no maple syrup.  Very disappointed in my food selection , I tried my friends food as well and theirs was special either . 

Also since when do we tip on tax ?  Very disappointed with this venue , wouldn't eat here again"}
{"text":"Great service!   Great food!   I order General Tso's chicken-  It was the BEST!   I also tasted to my friends' order, really outstanding!   I highly recommend to go for dinner!"}
{"text":"We often come here for sunday brunch.  The eggs Benedict is always good, but the chaudron cochon is what we come for.  Great especially for that hangover.  Terrace during the summer is especially nice."}
{"text":"OMG wish we had this in NYC. Such a fun place always go here here when I go to Montreal.  The food is good s wonderful and the menu has a lot type of everything.  The space is great they have a dj spinning and the staff is warm and helpful.  Brunch and dinner if you go to Montreal you must try them out"}
{"text":"Call me a stupid American all you want, but this place serves up THE BEST POUTINE I had in Montreal. Scandalous.

I came to Montreal from NYC for a weekend away, with the explicit goal of eating some legit Canadian poutine. Everything online pointed me toward La Banquise, which turned out to be a huge touristy disappointment. 

So on my last morning before flying back down south, I stopped at Le Saloon for brunch, which offers poutine as a +$5 upgrade side for most dishes. I got the classic eggs benedict with poutine. Screw the eggs. I could've eaten two bowls of that poutine and probably more, except that this is the Gay Village and one must at least pretend to not like fatty foods.

I'm rambling. Mostly because I'm now back in NYC wishing I was in Montreal eating poutine at Le Saloon Bistro Bar. #fatboyproblems

Ambiance is nice, servers were great blah blah blah. Get the poutine."}
{"text":"Le soir, l'ambiance du Saloon est assez spéciale (mais pas déplaisante). La musique électro se fait bien entendre et les écrans géants sur les murs diffusent des vidéos légèrement coquines (après tout, on est dans le quartier gay). 

La nourriture est bonne mais un peu chère à mon goût (minimum $18 pour un burger). J'ai goûté la poutine de patates douces qui était généreusement garnie, avec du porc effiloché, du fromage et une bonne quantité de sauce. C'est à la base une entrée (à $10) qui peut largement suffire si l'on n'a pas un appétit d'ogre. Côté boissons, la carte des cocktails est très large (il manque juste quelques cocktails sans alcool mais je suis sure qu'en demandant aux serveurs on peut également trouver son bonheur)."}
{"text":"i used to be a fan but after my last experience here... I'm thinking its time to scout another resto in the village! now, their are many to choose from... too bad this one lost its luster!
I normally have the Ibiza salad, which is a greek salad with chicken but Ibiza is   in Spain... that s another story, I was shocked to see a salad was $21!!! wtf... and its not even that amazing!!
this night I had the saloon burger, one of their staple burgers... a no brainer, but the bread was dry and crumbling, the meat was precooked and overcooked! My friend had a burger too, same issue with the meat and bun... but he had a poutine! I had a taste of the poutine, it was disgusting and had no flavor...Mcdonalds makes a better poutine!
I think its time to get back to the basics and become a restaurant instead a wannabe resto-club!"}
{"text":"Nice Cocktail Lounge

A friend and I dropped by Saloon to grab a couple of drinks before going out for dinner. This was a pretty great place and based on the reviews, I do not think that I was too far off of the mark. Although I had only two drinks during this visit, I will say that my favorite drink was the Caesar (or at least I think that what the drink was called). The Caesar basically is a Caesar salad in liquor form . . . think a Bloody Mary with a few more veggies and a pepper spiced rim, served in a mug.

Although we did not stay too long at Saloon, this place seems like a perfect place to meet up and grab some fun cocktails (Saloon has an extensive list of interesting and original cocktails) and/or a bite to eat with your friends. 

Our bartender was really nice and great at mixing our drinks. ."}
{"text":"It's one of those places I'm glad to have near my work, because I don't feel all that bad about forgetting to pack a lunch. Only having gone during the day, Saloon offers a varied lunch menu with plenty of options at three different price brackets. The service is fast and friendly and the kitchen is consistent. Whether you're in the mood for a sandwich or burger, or perhaps a healthier alternative (I recommend the salmon with roasted veggies and mashed potatoes) you're sure to find something tasty without breaking the bank.

I've gone back multiple times and will continue doing so."}
{"text":"In all our trips to Montreal, I've avoided Saloon as it looks like a typical bar. I'm kicking myself now. The service was friendly and the food blew me away for the price. Try the flat iron steak - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"So far this was my favorite restaurant experience in Montreal--better than Bonaparte even and obviously cheaper.  This is a cafe with good modern music and interesting art/decor. I had the cheeseburger with bacon and iceberg lettuce in place of the bun.  Delicious!  The service started slow but improved.  I'm a fan and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Cet endroit hyper prisé du Village m'a déçue. 

Oui, l'endroit semble happening de l'extérieur ; oui, le décor à l'intérieur est \"top-design\" ; oui, tout le monde n'en dit que du bien... mais moi, le Saloon m'a laissée plus qu'indifférente.  Franchement, j'aimerais bien savoir ce sur quoi tout le monde \"tripe\" au 1333 Sainte-Catherine Est !

La bouffe est plus que de base (si je me rappelle bien, je m'étais commandé un burrito... sans goût, sans éclat, trop de sauce, complètement \"blah\") ; le service est mauvais (on oublie de nous apporter ce que nous avons demandé, on tarde à nous servir de l'eau... dois-je absolument être gaie pour recevoir un sourire, monsieur ?) ; la musique est beaucoup trop forte...  

Enfin, mon souvenir est vague.  Ce dont je me rappelle est que je n'ai pas vécue une très belle expérience et que je ne souhaite pas y remettre les pieds.

So unfortunately, so long, Saloon."}
{"text":"J'adore cet endroit! J'y suis allée à quelques reprises pour le brunch avec des amies et c'est toujours agréable. Le service est rapide et courtois, la nourriture est excellente et le choix de drinks alcoolisés offerts ne se limite pas au traditionnel mimosa. Mention spéciale à Kevin qui s'est occupé de nous avec brio à chacune de nos visites."}
{"text":"I go to Montreal every year for vacation and I tend to love everything about it. The food is wonderful, the people are friendly, the atmosphere is beautiful. Then I went to Le Saloon.

If you're an Anglophone, avoid this place. A group of friends and I were recommended this place by a Francophone as a great place for brunch and cocktails. When we got there, we were seated in an inconvenient and out of the way second floor with no air conditioning on a very hot day. Even though we were sweating like oxen, we decided to try and make the best of it. However, their brunch menu was French only, and when we asked if there was an English-language menu, our waiter said no. Nonplussed, we did all of the work ourselves, translating every single item we wanted, since he did not try to help us once he knew we spoke no French. We ordered everything in French as best we could, along with drinks.

The food and drinks were good, don't get me wrong. Everything else was awful. The waiter, who appeared to be afflicted with an attitude problem wherein he spoke perfectly serviceable English but chose to act like a buffoon out of a commitment to outright snobbery, took half an hour to even come back with our drinks and take our orders. The restaurant was nowhere near busy enough to warrant this, mind you. 45 minutes later, we got our order, which was chock full of meat that we had specifically, in French, requested be left off of it for our vegetarian friends in the party, rendering the food uneatable. Finally, after ordering a second round of drinks to stave off the heat, half an hour of being ignored convinced us to cancel the outstanding order and have our checks brought to the table.

Let me make one thing clear. I tip. I tip 20% across the board, unless the service is bad enough to dip below that or stellar enough to warrant more. The service was so half-assed and passive-aggressive that I broke this rule and didn't tip a cent. If I could subtract my tip from the total I would have felt somewhat assuaged.

In closing, I hope I don't have to point out the hilarity of a cowboy-themed bar being insulted that awful Americans would grace their establishment. Nice to see our culture is good enough for you to structure your business around but our money isn't good enough for you to put any effort towards earning."}
{"text":"This review is for the adult beverages! I went one day when I was in the mood to drink... I mean really drink. So, I went in just before the lunch rush and grabbed a table. I made my way through several choices on the drink menu! I prefer non-sweet drinks, so I stuck with those choices. 

The Bloody pickle martini is a winner! I found the Williamsburg to be an ass kicker... I mean if you want to get wasted quick this may be a good choice! The service is fantastic here and I wish I had stayed for some food."}
{"text":"To quote my boyfriend \"the best poutine he has ever had\". If you ever visit Montreals gay district this is a top spot to visit, have a few drinks and for sure order some food. The beet salad is out of this world. We had a group of 5, the fried chicken sandwich (can't go wrong), the cowboy burger. The mac and cheese is one of the best. 
The selection of cocktails is second to none.  Can't make up your mind or like to try different drinks the amazing wait staff will be there with some awesome suggestions. 
Music is easy listing and very recent."}
{"text":"We went to brunch at this restaurant, nestled in the \"Village\" distinct of Montreal. I'd read up a little on this district so you aren't too surprised by passing some store fronts featuring S&M activities. Tip: the restaurant is just called \"Saloon\" on the door, but written in letters and numbers, so we walked by it a few times before we actually decided it was where we intended to dine.

I was impressed with the service (very speedy and very nice) and the decor. who doesn't want to have breakfast with a disco ball and a cowboy theme?

My dining companion and I both had versions of Eggs Benedict. the Italian version was tasty and served with crispy potatoes (potentially deep fried) and berries.  the other version that we ordered was salmon and caper Benedict, also tasty. 

The only thing I would suggest is perhaps removing some of the tables, maybe every other table. It was a little snug and as the table next to us got up to leave i swear the guy's little tush was inches from the rest of my breakfast."}
{"text":"Ate here twice on a visit to Montreal. Brunch was amazing, lunch was good not great. Had the eggs benedict with prosciutto with a Bloody Mary for brunch which was delicious and I highly recommend. For the lunch visit I had the Saloon burger which was tasty but a bit over cooked, order it rare (I ordered medium rare and it came medium)...but the Bloody Mary was still on point!!"}
{"text":"Don't Be Fooled By The Name, This Is Not A Saloon


   If you are looking for player pianos, poker games and a good ole' fashioned time, this is not the place...though you may find some chaps and a spittoon in the bathroom(oh, common;).

   My girlfriend and I were invited to The Saloon for her cousins birthday. We arrived late and they had already been seated so we had the pleasure of shuffling through the crowded maze that is the 'dining area', up a flight of stairs then another split level to the worst seats in the house. A table at the top of the restaurant, practically in the bathroom and up against a mirror...I might be a tad narcissistic but that is just ridiculous.

The Menu:

     I don't like where things are going in the burger world and The Saloon are some of the food assassins that are ruining a good honest burger(Buns, What What). Don't get me wrong, a drizzle of black truffle oil or a slice of Jarlsberg is nice every now and again but where does it stop. And if you are going to go to that extent, have it make sense. What the fuck is arugula pesto mayo??? Someone call the redundancy department of redundancy.


The Food:

     I did the Table d'hote which was pretty dang good and simple because I did not want to have to deal with reading all my possible burger toppings. My waitress told me it consisted of a risotto, tilapia and veg and a blackberry confit thingy for $19...not a bad deal. My first course arrived...and for a minute I though that they had my order wrong but no, my waitress omitted the fact that the 'risotto' is actually clumps of mushy rice balls that are breaded and fried. Saloon, calling that a risotto would make every Venetian cook, who has devoted their lives to making smooth creamy risottos, throw up all over themselves in disgust. Not that they tasted bad but risotto, it is not... I advise you update the menu...'Fried Rice Balls'

   My fish and veg were cook to absolute perfection but the menu promised fleur de sel on my fish and I did not have a speck of the beautiful stuff anywhere, for shame.

    The dessert was pretty good.

   To summarize, thanks but no thanks. I don't understand why people enjoy eating with terrible music blaring in the background and screaming at their table mates but hey, to each their own.If you do like this place, I recommend Globe.

{"text":"Tuna tartare was wonderful and same for my salad.  Drinks were also nice and strong.  Excellent vibe and the service was great."}
{"text":"The BEST..I mean BEST french onion soup I have ever had.

Service was cute and fairly attentive.  They were drinking shots most of the night with a patron at another table, but kept me happy.  Food was good.  Not great...but good.  Except the french onion soup.  WOW.  Guiness Beer base.  Delicious

Bathroom was also one of the best in Montreal!  Love the cleanliness and mirrors!  Check it out"}
{"text":"Stopped here late on a Sunday evening. The biggest benefit is that this is one of the few places in the Village that's open later (or at all) on Sunday.

The vibe is very hip and the decor matches. Most entrees are $15-20 and upwards.

I had one of the pasta dishes (Scooby Doo a Chorizo) which was pretty tasty, if a bit lacking in sauce. I was a bit shocked, though, that a pint of beer was $9! 

Overall, not a bad place. There are probably better priced options within walking distance, but pickings are slim on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"The bf and I were going to see Sugar Sammy at the Olympia one Friday night (if you get the chance, check out his show \"You're Gonna Rire\", so worth it!!). Anywho, not knowing the area very well, we searched some restos with Yelp's Help. We settled on Le Saloon as it featured a good variety. 

Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted and seated immediately. The host was a doll; very attentive and welcoming. The decor is very cool; rustic mixed with old Hollywood. I loved it. We decided to start off with drinks as it was still a little early; we each ordered a draft beer, and I have to admit, they tasted a bit watered down. This was probably the only disappointing aspect of the place. We had planned on eating supper here, but decided to start off with an appetizer to share; as Danny is allergic to all fish & seafood, we decided to try out the poutine (mmmm poutinnnee). We didn't think it would be a large portion, but when it came out, we were starting to wonder if they had brought us a double portion, considering it was rather large. What I loved was that the gravy came on the side, allowing us to put as much or as little as we desired, and the fries didn't get soggy during transportation. The fries were handcut and perfectly crispy on the outside / tender on the inside; the gravy had a tinge of sweetness to it, offsetting the saltiness of the cheese curds and fries, and well cheese curds were so delish. Like I said, we had intended on eating supper here, but the poutine was so filling, we ended up leaving afterwards. However, we do intend on coming back because we enjoyed the atmosphere, staff and food! I recommend checking this place out, even if just for a 5à7 :)"}
{"text":"I feel that this place is more for tourists in summertime and it gets its notoriety because it has been opened for almost 20 years. Food isn't that good to be honest. Very laid back and casual but not necessarily in a good way... Wouldn't necessarily recommend this place unless my auntie from florida insist on it"}
{"text":"Bons cocktails, cadre et musique sympa, beaux serveurs. Les mojitos sont bons mais un peu légers en alcool. 
Bon endroit pour grignoter et boire un verre avant d'enchaîner"}
{"text":"Excellente nouriture, j'ai mangé le cheese chicken crispy , juste excellent!  mais ne vous attendez pas à un \"huge\" hamburger ! C'est un hamburger  à manger après une bonne entrée et un super pinot noir  (Philipe) fut un en excellent serveur , et merci à lui car la nuit du vendredi est bien pleine! Enfin si vous voulez un endroit convivial et où l'on mange bien, moi je vous le conseil"}
