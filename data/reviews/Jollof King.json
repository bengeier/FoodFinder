{"text":"Saw it driving by had to stop and try it out. The gentleman was very welcoming, helped me out with my order since i don't eat meat, he recommended something vegetarian. Service is great and very clean. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food. The server Kevin and the owner Kwesi gave me a grand tour of all the dishes before I settled for fufu with goat soup and jollof king rice. Even my 8-year-old said, \"I can totally eat this!\" We can't wait to go back for more and try the peanut soup and meat pies."}
{"text":"I stopped by this new restaurant recently and left with a full stomach and good impressions!  I loved the Waakye with Chicken Stew...the plate included a hard boiled egg, spaghetti, and fried plantains!  The best way to describe the taste is \"AWESOME\"!  Give this place a chance...you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Prepare for depth of flavor! It is scrumptious food made with love. My family (couple plus two small kids) went to Jollof King for dinner on a Thursday for my birthday. We'd passed the sign for a new West African restaurant and became interested. Atmosphere is warm and inviting, and Kweku--sensing we were new to the tastes--kindly gave us a tour of the flavors. We were instantly impressed with the Jollof rice. My wife got Jollof rice, plantains, fish & chicken stew. Kids had spaghetti and chicken stew, and I enjoyed banku with okra stew. Stew also had a generous portion of beef and mushrooms. I like spice and it didn't disappoint, but the kids' stew was more spicy than they bargained for. Kweku served them plain spaghetti, and each finished their portion. My selection--Banku--is fermented cassava and corn in a tender roll, and you enjoy it with the savory stew. (Think sourdough and the best spicy beef stew you can conjure.) I can't wait to return to try Fufu, the tempting meat pies, and some of the other items."}
{"text":"Can you give 10 stars? What a great restaurant! We pulled a uturn as soon as we saw the place. The food was really good, the perfect amount of spicy. I've never had jollof rice before it was great and luckily it was recommended to get the large. So I have leftovers. They also have this really cool ginger drink. Probably one of our new faves! Thanks!"}
{"text":"This food is amazing. I'm. A Cameroonian-American and it was like my mother's food. Absolutely wonderful. Just wish they gave more chicken. $18 only got me a thigh of chicken stew."}
{"text":"My second time ordering out here and I must say the first time I ordered the Jollof rice and fish stew was amazing and I should of stick with that dish the second time. I must say for 15.02 the cost is too much for the quality and period. They try to overload the bowl with lots of waakye or rice and not much sauce therefore leaving the meal dry and then cheap with the goat. When speaking with someone and ordering food I feel comfortable with that person understanding what I'm saying and not acting like they speak minimal English. You feel hopeless with dealing with the establishment at all."}
{"text":"I saw that this place was recently opened in the same office complex as my local Kinkos are got curious.  Sig O and I ordered like six different meals and we love all of them. The only disappointment was that we didn't get any bread.  We both thought that African food used bread in much the same way Middle Eastern cultures do so, live and learn.  Give it a try.  It was very delicious."}
{"text":"This place is delicious, so much so that I'm willing to leave a review or my own accord, a feat rarely known.  We came on a whim of wanting something novel to each of us and I just asked for whatever their favorite is and said yes to everything. The Jollof rice was amazing, similar to a Spanish rice but a much deeper flavor.  The goat stew was enjoyable.  I suppose it depends on which chunk of meat you get, but one of mine was pretty cartilage heavy with the other being primarily meat.  I'll definitely be back some time if I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"Literally everything on the menu is amazing! Good music, nice laid back environment. Everyone was really friendly too. If you like spicy food you gotta try it! A taste of the motherland right here in AZ!"}
{"text":"Awesome and clean environment. My food was extremely tasty and affordable. The services and servers were kind, helpful and professional. I will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Authentic Ghanian good in Tempe! I had the fufu (pounded plantains and cassava) with chicken stew. Absolutely delicious. Vegetarians, don't fear, lots of good options for you too. You can choose spinach stew as an option or go for the Jollof rice. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Jollof King yesterday with a Ghanaian colleague and friend. Great atmosphere, super customer service and yes, amazing food! I picked the Jollof Rice combo with beef stew. The rice was tasty with just enough spice. The beef stew was solid and tasted authentic. The plantains were a special treat to have on the side along with the spaghetti and hard boiled egg. Man, it was a taste sensation. Will definitely include Jollof in our lunch rotation!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time for lunch with my sister today.  Menu was kind of confusing.  We ordered fufu with peanut soup and beef, but pretty sure we got light soup with goat, but it was delicious and we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"An acquired taste. First time here and tried the Jollof veg rice with the beef stew and plantains. Unfortunately the beef stew had just one small bite of beef in it. The stew was similar to mutton korma or beef karahi for those familiar with Indo pak food. 
Staff was friendly. The setup still requires work. Looks nothing like the dishes shown on the menu."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and well seasoned! I had the goat and loved it. Everyone behind the counter was helpful and polite I would try it again."}
{"text":"I mad my first visit and EVERYONE was nice and welcoming. The has a cute layout and design. The woman that took care of us and took the time to explain different menu items to us. Once i got my order it had nice portions of everything..including the meat. I would recommend sitting down to enjoy your plate. I plan on coming back with a large group since there is more than enough seating. I was also able to watch the game the game on the nice sized tv."}
{"text":"I have never had West African food before and I'm so glad this is the place I first got to try it. When I first got in the owner was immediately super friendly and helped my mom and I choose what food we should get. He said that for first timers he suggests the king jollof rice which is what my mom got. AMAZING. Super flavorful and the chicken she got was perfectly cooked. I decided to get fufu with peanut soup. The beef was so tender it could be cut with my spoon and it was just spicy enough without taking away from flavor. 10/10 love the owner, the food, the music, etc."}
{"text":"Wonderful from start to finish. The smell embraces you when you walk in. Very helpful with recommendations. Perfect flavor. Unique meals. Rice, pasta, goat was cooked excellent, and my favorites - plantains with the right amount of sweet. The food was prepared already, so it was quick and hot too! Found it be accident and will be back soon. Thank you for something different and delicious."}
{"text":"I had the Waakye with chicken stew.  Very flavorful. The seasonings from the stew blended perfectly over the Waakye. I am craving some now lol. Great service as well. I will definitely be back."}
