{"text":"Coming from a Malaysian background, I really wanted to like this place but can only give it 2 stars.  The roti canai was decent although a little oily, curry was bland, but I almost gave it 1 star because of the hairy satay!  Not sure if they overdid the ginger or what exactly it was (they said it was lemongrass but lemongrass does not look like that), but it reminded me of biting into a hairy rat...gross to say the least."}
{"text":"Great seafood laksa, as authentic as you can get for Malaysian cuisine in Calgary. Kids loved the roti canai and drinks with coconut jelly. 

Service was good too"}
{"text":"I was visiting C-Town and my friend took me here to banana leaf and to my suprise it was great! The small restaurant is cozy and the waitresses friendly.  The food was above expectations!  I recommend the roti chicken  curry!   Will come back. 

Cheers,

{"text":"I grew up in Malaysia. Having moved to Calgary after many years living in various countries, this is the first Malaysian restaurant I have tried in Calgary.

When our friends suggested it, I was excited to see the few things they were offering on their menu (ie grilled fish with rice, hainanese chicken rice). The menu is definitely more Malaysian than the few other restaurants here that claims to be Malaysian but serves more of a fusion of Thai and/or Japanese mixed in with only a couple of Malaysian dishes.

I was hoping to have the grilled fish but changed my mind when I was told it will take 20 mins to serve. I had the fishball laksa with yellow noodles instead. It didn't blow my mind away. Definitely lots of ingredients in the bowl but the soup was just slightly lacking in taste for me.

Hubby had his favourite Hainanese chicken rice. Generous portion. It looked good, and was tasty according to hubby. If only they served the less bony chicken breast (which is usually the preference in Asia) instead of the drumstick. 

Overall, wouldn't mind coming back here again if I am desperately craving for Malaysian food but not sure if that would be anytime soon."}
{"text":"I can finally contribute to the ever-growing list of positive reviews for this restaurant! 
Unbeknownst to most people, you CAN actually call a few days ahead of time and book a reservation. However, if you're going for a spontaneous meal - like others have mentioned, be prepared to wait for a table as this place has been known to consistently have the line up out the door. So clearly they are doing something right! And yes, they are. 
From friendly service to mouthwatering, closest-to- authentic-without-actually-travelling-there Malaysian and Taiwanese dishes, this place is definitely good to go. 
Being aware of how busy this restaurant gets, I thought it best to call ahead and book a reservation (called on a Sunday and booked for the Tuesday for a party of 4). Unlike an old \"Seinfeld\" episode - Banana Leaf was extremely professional and kept our reservation. 
We were seated promptly and even though not all of us had yet arrived, our server was considerate and continued to check up on us. 
So once we were all present and accounted for -  the food indulgence began. 
Due to a best friend's tip that the dishes are designed to be eaten individually - as per her suggestion, we ordered a few dishes so we could all have a chance to sample more than one dish. 
A party can do this - just make sure you let your server know that you are sharing and they will kindly bring you more bowls to make it easier to do so. 
So a pretty great visit for my first time - as we ordered 5 dishes and got to take pleasure in all of them! 
We asked for : 1) The Roti Canai (2) The Beef Rendang which is served with a fried egg and Rice... Mmm... Fried egg...  (3) The Curry Beef Brisket Laksa (w/Yellow Noodles) (4) The Seafood Tom Yum (w/Vermicelli) and (5) The deep fried Taiwanese Style Chicken Nuggets (Spice Salt). C'mon now, you know I had to get my chicken fix one way or the other! 
And... The verdict: 5 out of 5! I tell ya, wish I was a skinny fat person so I could order more as there are also so many other dishes that have been recommended that I want to try. Especially now that I know that peeps aren't kidding when they say, \"You gotta try this...\"  
Oh, and as you noticed above I put in parenthesis what kind of noodle type we had with our soup dishes - it's because one can choose between the two. It's nice that they give you this option. 
Revisiting the reality that this place gets packed, once it's a full house, the staff becomes concerned that the wait for your food is lengthy, so they become extremely apologetic. But the reality is, the wait isn't that long and appetizers come out so quickly that you're good inbetween to wait a bit without feeling hungry. Your digestive system will thank you anyway. 
And to top it all off, prices are extremely reasonable. Example: For 5 dishes, including maximum tip - it only cost us $16 each between the 4 of us. And THAT would've been even less had we not added a second order of the Roti... Yeah we did. 
So the only real downside is that they are closed Mondays and every night at 8pm. But hey, this staff certainly deserves their rest considering they work so hard to keep our palates and stomachs happy. Which you'll understand once you decide to pay a visit to Banana Leaf. 
Sidenote: The phone number presently on Google is incorrect. It is actually: 403.450.3880
You'll wanna program it into your phone - I sure did as I plan to add this place to my Faves When I Crave list."}
{"text":"My first time here, I went with a date closer to the end of the night. While in line, we talked to the family behind us, and the mom informed us that she had lunch earlier that day for the first time at Banana Leaf, and it was so delicious that she's here now with her family for dinner. Major thumbs up already.

Our server, Christina(?) was so helpful. Whenever we asked about what she recommends, she went above and beyond and gave informative, and friendly advice. When I ordered a drink, she recommended a different flavour combination as the one I ordered can taste a bit 'weird'. I trusted her and have no regrets. I think we ordered two drinks that night.

My date ordered the curry beef brisket dish. The beef brisket is so tender and well flavoured (heat is there, but not sweat and tears inducing LOL). The cucumbers were fresh and a nice break from the curry. I am a peanut fanatic, and their peanuts were perfectly roasted and seasoned (if you're allergic, be sure to inform them!). 

I ordered one of their laksas with the yellow noodles (my fav), but I hear it's also fun if you order half vermicelli and half yellow noodles. The two things that are the stars of Banana Leaf (besides their laksas) are the roti, so buttery and flaky but crispy at the same time); and their shredded fish tofu (???), well fried tofu and the fish and sambal sauce that go with it have been the stuff of my dreams. 

At the end of the night, after the kitchen has closed, I forgot to order a bubble tea for my brother. Once i ordered, Christina made the drink right away with no problem.

Thanks for the excellent and welcoming service, and the yumma food, Banana Leaf!"}
{"text":"Unassuming look of the restaurant but the food is great! Spot on. I had the curry beef brisket laksa this time. Last time was chicken laksa"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight. Place is a hole in the wall. Seriously bad Malaysian food. The roti was nice and crisp but the rest were either too oily or unlike any authentic Malaysian food. The service was not great as the team kept forgetting or were overwhelmed. Perhaps in a month, they may get their act together. Nice guys serving or trying to.
Would I recommend this place as a Malaysian restaurant? Not at all. 
Good crowd, perhaps out of nostalgia.
Not to eat include,  satay, laksa, nasi lemak. Satay seems over cooked with no char. 
Thanks for the effort guys but not coming back."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. A little bit too spicy for those w little spice tolerance. Cash and debit only."}
{"text":"Decent laksa. I hear the rest of the menu items are good too. 
Brisk trade at lunch.
Cash or debit."}
{"text":"We were craving Laksa and Roti and we were in the north of Calgary. So we decided to go to Banana Leaf! Came here many times before and it would be packed around 6pm, but today at 6pm it did not seem too bad.

I had to ordered the milk tea with grass jelly! if you enjoy milk tea you will like it here! For appy. we had the roti cani and taiwanese chicken (garlic one). The roti was nice and flaky and with the 'curry' like sauce, it was the perfect match! For the chicken, if you LOVE garlic you will enjoy this dish! (had garlic breath the whole night) The chicken was still juicy and not dry (i believe they use dark meat).

Last but not least the Laksa! The laksa here is more of a creamy curry soup base. We ordered the beef brisket, the meat was tender and soft and the curry soup had the perfect spice to it. You get to pick yellow noodles or vermicelli. I enjoyed the yellow noodle as it gives a better bite. The Laksa also had bean sprout and deep fried tofu. It was very satisfying! 

Note they only take cash or debit. Place is a bit small so come early for some yummy food!

You can ask for a bit mild in spice but it may still be spicy if you don't eat spicy food."}
{"text":"I'm an Indonesian, this place has authentic taste! My favourite menu are Beef Rendang Laksa and Nasi Lemak. Too bad need to pay extra more for Sambal."}
{"text":"Both times visited had the curry seafood laksa. It was amazing!  We were a group of 5 served very well without waiting very long (without reservation). The place is very cozy but don't expect to have your group of 12 seated and served in under an hour since it seems to be a small volume kitchen.  Laksa'a are a hit. Haven't tried anything else but every dish we seen come out from the kitchen looked delicious. Comments from others in the room all in line what everyone is saying about this place \"everything is fresh\""}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and it was quite busy as it always was at lunch time. The place is incredibly small and most tables are for 2-4 people, however there are just a couple of tables for larger groups. There were a few tables available, but the server said we have to wait for no reason. We waited for about 15 minutes until we got a table. I ordered the Nasi Lemak Chicken Curry with rice and a blueberry slush. The waiter tells me that there is no more blueberries, so I ordered a strawberry slush instead. 5 minutes later, he comes back and says there are no more strawberries. I then asked for a mango, and guess what? No more mango. I told him to just get me water instead. The chicken in the curry was dry and not fresh. They probably just microwaved old chicken. The rice and curry itself was very good, but the chicken ruined the entire dish for me."}
{"text":"The food here is really, REALLY good. I can't believe I only just discovered this place. I had the chicken laksa ($11.50) and the flavor was on point. The portions are great and the prices  affordable. The space is quite small and low-key but the staff bring a lot of personality. I'll be back."}
{"text":"There's been so much talk about this place, I had to try it.

Expect to wait for a table because the news has spread beyond the capacity of this small unassuming restaurant next to Kaltire.

Check out C T.'s review below because I used his selected menu items as a reference for my first experience here. Definitely order their Roti Canai. I had their Tom Yum Seafood Noodle Soup. It was delicious. I was sad I didn't have enough room to finish the bowl.

They need another server on the floor because the two young adults were running around like mad taking care all of us. Props and thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"I was blown away with how nice the people were and most of all, how delicious the curry beef laksa was!  I'll be making the drive to eat here again for sure."}
{"text":"Love their roti! So much so that we always get a minimum of 1 order per couple. They also have a delicious chicken appetizer which we like with the spicy salt. For the mains, the fish in banana leaf, pork on rice, and nasi lemak are delicious. The laksa is amazing...if you can't take as much spice, then choose the yellow noodle. Somehow it seems spicier with the vermicelli noodle."}
{"text":"Lots of appetizer selection.   Must try:  roti, spicy Taiwenese noodle soup, chicken laksa.  Good service.  Restaurant can use better ventilation."}
{"text":"Came on Valentine's Day! It was super busy and it was the one night that they were taking reservations---- and we did not have any! Host/ Owner was very accommodating! We can totally understand the frustration associated with the limited space and the huge crowd! Food overall was good. We ordered the roti-- amazing, Spice gelatinous rice roll--- meh, chicken satay was good , Deep fried chicken nugget taiwanese style was-- amazing! Would totally come back again but more on a weeknight if you are avoiding a crowd and want to be seated right away!"}
{"text":"Loved my meal here, I couldn't fault it! 

The food was inexpensive ($10 for a big bowl of Laksa) and delicious. I got the hainan chicken laksa and the broth was amazing. I had to pick through the bones, but that was my own fault because I know what hainan chicken is like. They even let me get half rice noodles, half yellow noodles because I couldn't decide which one I wanted! 

My friends had a vegetarian laksa (same shrimp paste broth, which she was fine with, but lots of tofu and veggies) and the Nasi Lamek and they both loved their meals. The Nasi Lamek had the most amazing sauce.
I also had the roti with curry sauce to dip and it was so delicious. I think I could have eaten that for my entire meal. I might do that next time. Staff was very kind and attentive even when we stayed far past their closing time of 8pm. 
 
I can't wait to go back and try their hainan chicken and chicken nuggets, they looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Great little family run Fusion Malaysian/TaiwaneseThai foods, very authentic, Roti Canai, Curry, Laksa are all very good, very rich spicy flavors, appetizers are very good. Great friendly services. No reservation, very busy little place about 30 seats. Highly   Recommended."}
{"text":"Consistency is KEY!!! and Banana Leaf hits its mark time and time again! I think I've had just about everything on the menu and the server last time knew exactly what we wanted without even asking. This is my \"Go To\" recommendation when people ask for great affordable food. The Beef Laksa is incredible! The brisket is tender and the creamy coconut curry sauce is perfect for putting some spice in your meal and exercising your sweat glands! Now be warned if you are the type of foodie who thinks spicy means \"Oh my god, is there onion in this?\" then you might want to try something a little more pedestrian, like their Hainanese chicken which is refreshing and the special rice is awesome! Now if you will allow me to be so bold but you should try the Bak Kut Teh. This is their one dish they sell out sometimes early in the day and with good reason. Its a herbal tasting savoury clear broth soup served with rice or noodles. Its kind of an acquired taste but hits the spot when your rained out or looking for a comfort food. Portions are generous, staff are friendly. I'm a also sensitive to MSG and they assured me they don't use it! so indulge :D 

TIPS: It gets busy cause its tiny, weekdays are better than weekends but if so go at off times maybe 2pm. Bak Kut Teh runs out on weekends quickly! Stuff like their Beef Rendang & Nasi Lemak is SPICY so when you see a chili pepper or even 2 beside the menu item its not to be taken lightly :)   

PROS: \"LEGO SONG\" 
CONS:  If I have to nit pick: Small place so planning required, stuff runs out! weird parking!"}
{"text":"Finally a Malaysian restaurant that serves up dishes with authentic Southeast Asian flavours in Calgary. I have to confess that when I first heard about Banana Leaf I was skeptical because the friend who recommended it has never travelled to Asia so though I expected the food to taste decent I expected a Canadian version of Asian food. 
Banana Leaf is in a strip mall that has a standalone KFC/Taco Bell in the parking lot facing 32 Ave NE. The complex also houses an Asian grocery, a Midas and a car wash at opposite ends so it's not surprising I never even saw the sign for the restaurant even though I have driven past the place on numerous occasions. The restaurant itself is nondescript. It's a basic, fairly small, elongated space with as many square 2-seater tables they can cram in the place as possible. The square tables are put together for larger parties. There is one round table that seemed to be an afterthought. The place looks clean and the menu small but with dishes that are staples of Southeast Asia: Rendang, Nasi Lemak and Hainanese Chicken Rice to name a few. We tried the Nasi Lemak and the Hainanese Chicken Rice. 
Nasi Lemak (Rice Delicious is the literal translation from Malay) came with Pandan Rice. Pandan is a type of flavourful grass that is used to flavour cakes and jams in Singapore and Malaysia. The rice has a slight green tinge to it so it may look a little strange if you were not expecting it. There was the traditional fried peanuts with anchovies, a spicy vegetable side as well as curry chicken and a fried egg on top. The vegetables had a nice kick to them and the curry chicken was very authentic. In Singapore and Malaysia, the term curry is used similar to masala in Indian cooking; it is a number of spices ground into a paste and used to flavour the dish. Very often coconut milk is added as well. Here the curry chicken is not an Indian curry; it is definitely a type of curry you would get in Singapore or Malaysia. The chicken was tender and the flavour reminded me of the dishes I would get when I live in Singapore.  Portions are generous and prices very reasonable. This was around $10-12.
I am still on the quest for Hainanese Chicken Rice that is as good as I would get in Singapore but the Banana Leaf version comes close. I have reviewed the same dish from the Elbow River Casino. This one is closer to an authentic version mainly because of the sauces they served up with it. They had the right chilli and ginger sauces for the chicken. There was no broth with the dish but all in all a good version. There was a soy type sauce under the rice and I think this came from the vegetable side that they serve with this dish so it did take away from the authenticity of the taste of the rice.
I will definitely return to try the other stuff judging by the dishes we had. Parking was a problem even though it is a private lot. Some spots are reserved for Hertz and there are about 6-8 other businesses that share the lot. It was about 3:30 p.m. on a Saturday and the lot was full and it took 2 drive arounds before we found a parking spot that was recently vacated."}
{"text":"I LOVE Malaysian food.  I recall telling hubby that one of the things I miss about being in Calgary is Malaysian restaurants as there are quite in few in Vancouver.  So when my friend told me that there is a Malaysian restaurant in Calgary, I was so excited!

Banana Leaf is located in a strip mall quite close to the NE Costco.  It's a small restaurant, but clean and child-friendly.  There's lots of parking.

Onto the food.  We ordered roti canai, seafood laksa and the bat kut teh with rice, which is some sort of Chinese herbal soup - never heard of it, but thought I would give it a try.  The roti was SO DRY.  It was crunchy throughout, and not in a good way.  It really just seemed overcooked.  I was really disappointed as I love roti and dipping the crunchy-on-the-outside but soft and flaky-on-the-side roti in the curry dipping sauce.  It wasn't a great start to the meal.  Then came the seafood laksa.  I wasn't a fan of the soup and I normally happily slurp down laksa soup.  It was quite bland, but spicy.  However, I loved the bat kut teh soup.  It was delicious and the meat was so tender.  It may be a bit of an acquired taste if you aren't used to Chinese herbs, but I loved it.  I'm not sure if I would go back just for the bat kut teh soup.  I may just save my Malaysian food cravings for the next time I'm visiting Vancouver (or Malaysia!)."}
{"text":"We were treated poorly today when we showed up just before lunch break. 

There were empty tables but the kid told us we had to wait for about a half hour as those tables were reserved. When I asked if we could reserve a table and come back in half an hour the idiot said no you just have to wait around. This is the same kid, who on several occasions, had messed up the order. 

I've been to this place several times because they have a couple of good dishes but screw it...I ain't going back."}
{"text":"This review is for the second time I've been to Banana Leaf and don't remember the first time so I thought it deserved a second try. My husband and I got there at around 11:30 am on a Saturday. The space is small and fills up quite quick. The tables are so close together, I could overhear the awkward conversation between a man and his wife from the table beside us. I got the nasi lemak curry chicken combo and my husband got the Hainanese chicken laksa with yellow noodles. My chicken curry came on a separate dish, which was thoughtful since I didn't want the sauce to mix with the rice too much. They used chicken thighs for this dish but it ended up tasting very dry and unfresh. I was 100% sure the chicken curry was made a day or two ago and reheated for a long time. Keep in mind, it's hard to overcook dark meat yet the thighs were extremely dry. The Hainanese chicken with the laksa, on the other hand, was very moist, succulent and fresh which is why I'm positive the nasi lemak chicken was an old batch. The flavor of the curry in general was good and the laksa had a good balance of curry, spicy and coconut flavors. Upon paying, I told the teenage cashier about the chicken tasting old and they naturally defended the freshness and that they would tell the kitchen staff. I would return to Banana Leaf but only order the laksa."}
{"text":"Really good food, especially the Laksa with beef. Service okay, not a fancy place at all. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Banana Leaf for a while and decided to pop in during their non-busy hours.  We had great service and choice of tables.  We ordered:
- Roti Canai - Ah!  Just like back home!  Dip your roti (bread) into the light curry broth and eat it!  We used to eat this for breakfast!!  :o)
- Hainanese Chicken Rice - The oily rice was perfect!  The chicken was ok.  It wasn't like the real Hainanese chicken we used to get back in Singapore, but it'll do.  The chicken comes on a steel plate with bean sprouts and cabbage in a light soya, semi-sweet sauce.  There are also fresh cucumber slices as well.  The chicken dish is also served with garlic and ginger condiment as well as chilli sauce.  Not quite the same as back home but as I said, it'll do.
- Seafood Laksa - I must say they've improved on their recipe. The broth is a light coconutty soup with a hint of spice.  I can tell there is Daun Kesum (Malaysian) or Rau Rum (Vietnamese) (herb to eat with Laksa) in it but it gets overshadowed by the Cilantro.  Next time, I will ask to them to hold the cilantro.  There are deep-fried tofu puffs, bean sprouts, 2 big prawns, fish pieces, cuttlefish, fish balls and fish cake pieces.  Delicious nonetheless!  

Only cash and debit at this restaurant.

A piece of Singapore & Malaysia in Calgary!  Will be back, Banana Leaf!"}
{"text":"Oh Banana Leaf, how I wish you existed in Edmonton. I've been to Banana Leaf more times than some of my Calgarian friends! If that ain't a stamp of approval, then I don't know what is. Seriously, one of my favourite places in Cowtown!

We came for a late Sunday Mother's Day brunch (sans mothers!) and it was busy. Wait time was about 25 minutes to get a table for four but as always, totally worth the wait. People eat and go so turnover is fairly quick. Hurray for Asians being considerate when it comes to eating. The two waitresses/daughters run the front and are always excellent.

Hours are good - don't forget they're closed Monday! No reservations on weekends.

Everything on the menu is bomb. I have yet to try anything here that I haven't liked. Roti canai is a must. The bah kut teh (#14) is actually delicious. Very medicinal. You also can't go wrong with the traditional nasi lemak. A ton of people ordered it while we were waiting and it looked soooo good.

Trip #1
- Mango green tea (#42) ($4.50) - super light, refreshing and not overpowering, a good thing in my books.
- Mango slush (#56) ($5.50) - it's an extra $0.75 for coconut jelly, red bean or grass jelly. I've never had the slush (frozen fruit) before so we decided to try the mango with coconut jelly. Best decision ever. So fresh! You can taste the mango pulp. Can't wait to try the other slush flavours.
- Roti canai (#6) ($4.50) - always a must order. Crispy, flaky, tender, melt in your mouth deliciousness. Dip into the curry sauce and the roti elevates to another level. I seriously need to figure out how to make this sauce at home.
- Deep fried tofu with garlic and green onion (#8) ($6.50) - my sis loves this appetizer as she can get it cooked to accommodate her gluten intolerance. Always comes out piping hot with a slight crunchy exterior but oh so soft, silky smooth inside. Litaly said this was the best tofu he's eaten.

- Curry chicken rice (#15) ($12.50) - we decided to try something new and got the curry chicken rice plate. Rice with a cooked egg on top, peanuts (addictively good), cucumber and curry chicken. The chicken was super tender and flavourful. It has two spicy icons on the menu but we didn't find it packing much heat. But flavour is spot on so it's all good.

- Deep fried chicken with Thai lemon sauce rice (#19) ($12.50) - another new dish we tried but requested without the deep fried batter. I actually really liked the sauce as you get a light sweetness and pinch of acidity. Stir fried onion and green onions top things off.

- Seafood tom yum soup (#24) ($12.50) - tom yum came out last but it was great. 
Lemongrass comes to the forefront immediately which I love! Broth is fragrant and complex with a good mixture of seafood.

- Curry beef brisket laksa (#26) ($12.95) - this is what you come to Banana Leaf for. You have to order at least one of the laksa's - you honestly can't go wrong. I think I've tried them all by the now. The beef brisket is super tender but still retains a nice bite. Creamy, rich, spicy, I could eat this bowl every day. I'd also probably be fat but it would be totally worth it.

Trip #2
- Mango bubble tea (#53) ($4.50) - mango bubble tea with grass jelly. Even though these are powder flavoured, they're still delicious. Only place I'd go to get powder bubble tea.
- Matcha bubble tea (#56) ($4.50) - we've had the match with red beans many times. I don't know what it is about red beans but it adds great texture and sweetness.

- Spicy glutinous rice roll (#2) ($6.50) - finally got to try their spicy glutinous rice roll! These are only on the menu once in a blue moon. I wasn't blown away but they were good. Reminds me of joong (Chinese rice wrapped in lotus leaves).
- Roti canai (#6) ($4.50) - another roti canai ordered. Every table will have one. 
- Deep fried tofu with garlic and green onion (#8) ($6.50) - this is always ordered when we come here. My sis can't get enough.
- Deep fried crispy chicken nuggets (#10) ($9.95) - Taiwanese style with your choice of spice salt or garlic and onion. Obviously, we went with the spicy option. I never get to order this because my sis can't eat it but we were with two other friends so I finally got to try it! It's even better than the deep fried tofu, if that's possible.

- Grilled fish wrapped in banana leaf and rice (#21) ($13.95) - if you have time, order the grilled fish. It takes about 25 to 30 minutes to prepare but the wait is well worth it. Bursting with flavour and incredibly tender.

- Curry beef brisket laksa (#26) ($12.95) - the broth was much more creamier. Still so much depth, complexity and flavour in one bowl. The beef brisket is tender and generous in portion.

- Hainanese chicken laksa (#27) ($12.50) - The Hainanese chicken laksa is just as good, if not better. You get a variety of chicken pieces with tofu, a hard boiled egg, etc.

Banana Leaf is the best. The only place to go to get your Taiwanese/Malaysian cravings satisfied. Don't forget cash or debit only!"}
{"text":"Holy moly is the food spicy but it's great! The presentation isn't where it should be but I have no complaints about the food. It's homemade, it's tasty, it's local! Vote Banana Leaf!"}
{"text":"Why so low Yelp? :(

Came here with a group of 4 people on a Saturday night around 7PM.  Waited for about 10-15 mins, but oh it was so worth it.

3 of us got different styles of laksa and it definitely hit the spot!  I would actually argue that it is slightly better than Mamak for its laksa. The broth is so creamy, full of ingredients and perfect for a rainy day.

The grilled fish apparently takes 20 minutes so if you're itching to try it, I would suggest ordering beforehand.  We actually had no idea, but will be back next time to try it out. The roti canai, unfortunately, came out a bit burnt.  I kindly told the waiter and after a quick apology, he came right out with a brand new and fresh roti canai. Good save my friend, good save.

The service was spot on, pay at the cashier once you're done and then you're off.

Quick, efficient and delicious.  4 stars.  Maybe 4.5?"}
{"text":"Came here on a friend's recommendation on a weekday lunch.  Heard the place can get quite busy so we showed up shortly after they opened at 11am.  No problem getting a table.  Ordered roti canai, curry beef brisket laksa, satay chicken sticks, and curry chicken.  All food were excellent. The peanut sauce for the satay chicken sticks were on the spicy side so the kids didn't quite enjoy them as much as other places.  Also ordered a bubble tea (waitress explained that bubble tea doesn't come with bubbles which was odd, but we got coconut jelly instead which was good) and also a mixed berry smoothie.  Both drinks were very large.  Very happy with the meal we had."}
{"text":"I ordered #21 from the menu. A curry chicken over coconut rice and fried anchovies. The waiter insisted that I got this one when I really wanted a simple chicken curry. He said he would remove the anchovies but still charged the full price of the plate ($12.95 or so). 

The chicken thigh was seriously so dry that I couldn't get it off the bone. I kept getting bone in my mouth by accident. So gross! The curry sauce tasted good but it was overcooked and very oily (you know when you overcook a cream sauce so much that it thickens and the fat separates from the cream?). The soup also looked very oily, with that orange melted fat floating all over it. It also had chicken with bone in it, which is difficult to eat and somewhat disgusting.

Don't get me wrong. I love exotic curry and Asian noodle soups! Sure, the food is authentic, but it was very poorly executed and tasted like cheap and unhygienic street food you'd find in poor neighborhoods in Asia."}
{"text":"Food here was great and authentic (even not by Calgary standards).  Roti, laksa, tofu, all pretty good, very satisfied."}
{"text":"So far the best Malaysian in town, even though it cannot be compared to a Malaysian restaurant I've tried in New York. In Calgary you don't expect that much.  Haianese chicken laksa  was delicious and flavourful and get a side of bubble tea to drink to beat the heat your going to get from the noodles. Perfect"}
{"text":"Great Malaysian restaurant with authentic food and great prices. Bak kut teh, laksa, roti are all authentic tasting and spices are right on. 

Does not always open and it's almost impossible to sit a party greater than four. Make unplanned visits at your own risk or always remember to call ahead.

I subtracted a star due to its inconsistent opening times. Since it's so popular I want it all the time but sometimes they're just blatantly not open."}
{"text":"Since going here every once in awhile I have to say their service has gotten much better.  People are really friendly and accommodating to larger parties.  It is a lot easier to get seated at lunch (provided you call ahead).  The food is still amazing, that hasn't changed.

I'm giving a 4-star review (previously 2-stars) because of all the improvements.  One incident still lingers that hold it back from a 5-star review.  We once went in with a larger party of 10+ people.  Everyone paid and I was the second last person to pay.  I asked if everyone had paid except for the last two people (myself and my friend). After checking the bill they said yes, everyone was covered except for us.  I paid my bill and left my friend to pay his.  Later on I was told he got stuck with 2 dishes.  After discussing with them later on they insisted that someone didn't pay.  I checked with everyone that ate there that day and they all said they paid.

I think it's still a great place and I think the people are really friendly.  It's just that once incident that still lingers in my mind that is holding me back from giving it a 5-star review."}
{"text":"The customer service at banana leaf this evening was excellent. Danny and Diane were our servers, they closed the restaurant down, so very hard-working, sweet, considerate, went out of their way to make our meal delicious and make us feel welcome. 

The curry sauce with our roti canai had a little too much chili oil in it. We caught Diane's attention, she came over, listened to our question, offered a reason why it was like that and immediately brought us back a new sauce. It was perfect.

This is a small restaurant with a specialized cook. They work very hard. The food is consistently delicious. Highly recommend Banana Leaf if you can get in. It is small so there usually is a wait."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and ordered the Nasi lemak with chicken curry and my friend had the roti prata with curry sauce and a side of curry fish balls.

The best part about the meal was the sambal.

I found my rice was just ok with the sambal saving the day.
The curry chicken was very dry though. The chicken was fried and had not much meat and was overdone.

My friend's order of roti canai was ok but the curry sauce was very oily.
The fishballs were delicious but still has too much oil in the sauce.
See the pics I took."}
{"text":"Never liked anything I ordered from here.. their laksa (gross) and this other noodle soup (bland)  and their nasi lemak is in a curry sauce which isn't authentic to the real Malaysian nasi lemak which is deep fried. Ive been to Malaysia and when I came here to try their food it was such a disappointment not even close to authentic!"}
