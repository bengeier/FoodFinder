{"text":"Great atmosphere. Have been in several times. Menu is a bit limited, so we did several appetizers for our actual dinner. All were very good. Drinks were all good - tried several....the blue hula girl was my fav :) I wish there had been more patio seating, as the weather is nice and these are EXACTLY the kind of drinks you'd like to drink on a patio on a warm evening! The owner is very attentive and always seems to  be on site and concerned that guests are having a nice time. Tiki Underground is a new restaurant to the community, I'd really encourage you to give this place a try."}
{"text":"First time here after change...loving it so far. Very cozy environment and drinks are amazing. Sooo tasty. Owners very nice. Haven't tried food yet but menu looks great. Same kitchen staff as before which were always amazing. Can't wait to see what's going to become of this Ohio tiki bar!!"}
{"text":"Really nice Tiki decor. Specialty drinks are very good and a really nice balance between not too sweet and not too strong. The Mai Tai is exceptional. Great coconut shrimp & pulled pork. Evidently the only bar in Cleveland with Kona Longboard on tap. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Smallest Margarita I've very seen, sent it back for size and weird taste. Stuck with a beer to be on the safe side! Quality very bad, Doubt they will last!"}
{"text":"Would give a higher rating but Yelp limits to 5 starts  Great place outstanding service PLENTY of free parking"}
{"text":"We decided to go to the Tiki Underground to have a night cap.  The Tiki theme was intriguing, especially considering the location! We were happy to find a very inviting spot.  The place was decently full and we decided to sit at the bar.  We had some expert tiki bar drinkers next to us to help navigate the menu, and the bartender was fantastic as well.  I had the green eye hula girl which looks super cool... ended up being a bit sour, but I enjoyed it. My husband had the Tiki Underground Mai Tai and it was phenomenal.  Next time I am certainly getting that one!  The bartender (Chris) was super super friendly.  Some other staff made a point of coming over and greeting us.  So friendly!! Definitely coming back for great drinks and an inviting spot.  Only had chips and salsa, so no real commentary on the food."}
{"text":"Stopped for happy hour drinks before cooking at home. Judging by the quality of the drinks, we're guessing the food must be great too! Fabulous handcrafted tropical cocktails with fresh ingredients! Owners and staff are friendly, interesting and knowledgeable.  Definitely coming back to try the menu!"}
{"text":"Best Mai Tai north of Cuba and East of Hawaii!!!!AUTHENTIC decor and fun, owners are good people. Go or go home"}
{"text":"Went to see one my favorite bands. Had never been to this restaurant under current ownership (has had many iterations over the years). Short-handed wait staff was first issue. Pleasant waitresses, but they can only do what they can do. Ok place, have a feeling it won't survive, just like the prior bars/restaurants that have been here. Staff at main bar were less than warm.  Good luck."}
{"text":"We ate dinner there on the Grand opening  night.   the food was good but I was confused if it is a restaurant or bar.  Drinks are on the expensive side.  I would consider the food expensive for  \"bar\" food.  Also, bring a flashlight because the bar is dimmly lit if you want to read the menu.  Nearly $50 for two sandwiches and drinks, we could have eaten at a better restaurant with more menu items."}
{"text":"Very good food and customer service. My mom said if I go on the computer she will smash my head against the keyboajdduufjfjrjchchrhfhdhrgdnsjoqwhhshfuehshdheueufjeiwyshdjfieuegshdjehsesjhdhewusjjddheuwjshdhdheuwiiwiqiqiqoqooqisjdjdhcxbsbasdfggjrjejrjhishshdhdhdhdhhrheheehehehehdoulikecheesejsdjjrriruurruruififrjrhdhudueueuufurhrhdydhehehdhdheueududrururyryryryryryryryryryeyeyryeyyryeyeueyryrrryeyeyeyrhrhhrhehdhehedhdhdhdhdhrhdysxuejdbxhejdgxhxhhhhdgehshduduuduezjzuxuxudududududu"}
{"text":"Come here instead of winking lizard and support a local small business! Great atmosphere, plentiful drink options, and good, inspired food!"}
{"text":"Food and drink was plentiful.  We each ordered a wrap and could have split one. Everything was delicious.   The staff was friendly and inviting.  The interior was clean.  We will definitely go back.    The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was that it was very dark inside.  There are lights but the bulbs are all colored.  We had to read the menu with our iPhone flashlight.  There was writing on the chalkboard - probably the specials but we couldn't read them."}
{"text":"Great drinks, great food, great music, cool vibe. I've been here twice - a Saturday night with bands playing and a Wednesday night with a smattering of bar patrons. The weekend night was very packed so I'd recommend coming early to get a table."}
{"text":"This place was great!! Strong drinks great decor fresh food. $5 burger and fries can't beat it. Owner was really great.  Will def be back"}
{"text":"Ever since Tequila Panchos closed, no one can seem to make a restaurant work at this location. My husband and I stopped in on a Friday night and there was hardly anyone there. It was very dark and service was slow. My husband ordered a mai Tai, but it wasn't very good. We had one drink and left."}
{"text":"We'd been to Tiki Underground a few times on weekdays and thought it was an interesting place with a different vibe. I liked that they bring in live music - sometimes with no cover. We recently went there on a weekend (what a mistake) to see a show and I kid you not, there was a guy smoking a cigarette INDOORS at a table right in front of us. I thought I was hallucinating. I asked my husband, \"Is that what I think that is??\" Yes. There he was puffing away and then pausing to take swigs of beer, then smoking some more. I haven't seen anyone smoke INDOORS in like fifteen years. Uh b/c it's illegal, hello?!? Not that they owners cared. I saw the owners busing tables nearby - they actually seemed to know him. Also, this same dude came in late and got seated a bit after the show started and was blocking our view - they got him a chair at a crowded table. So I got the impression that it's one of those bars that the owners just let their friends do what they want... sure fine, I get that it's one of \" those bars\" but smoking indoors in front of everyone? That's too much. After that experience, we won't be going back. Decent live music or not. Also, we kept catching whiffs of propane or some other chemical odor. I don't know if they are not storing the tiki torch fuel inappropriately or what but it smelled weird when there was a draft from outside."}
{"text":"While the theme is cool the service is horrendous! Waited 15-20 minutes for a drink and the person I was with who was not drinking alcohol never did get served his second drink. Bottom line very amateurish!"}
{"text":"So, I got pulled into a 'soft' opening of this place. It was the night that people from the PD were there covering it. What is it? It's a tiki bar. No, not the brand new hutch that looks like a corner ice cream vendor but covered in bamboo, this is a REAL tiki bar, like the kind you would find in LA or Chicago. And I have to say that it's a surprising and very welcome addition to CLE's coolness arsenal! It's like the yin to Porco's yang. Easy to get to from the east side, it's a great location that you can actually see from the highway ramp.  Tiki Underground is big for a tiki lounge, with a variety of seating and a ton of potential. The workers were very polite and gracious and they kept stressing that this was a 'soft' opening, but they really had it down! They have their own take on the mai-tai, and it's not the trashy red gunk that most bars will give you, this is a real grown-up cocktail ... and they have all the classics, too. You need a side car or a grasshopper? Tom collins or an old fashioned? They can do it and they do it well. Didn't eat but they had a menu, people were loving the wings here. I'm loving the really elaborate dark wood furnishings and wood carvings all over. There's a patio up front and it will be nice to see what they do in the summer."}
{"text":"The food is Delish I has the black bean burger the sauce was amazing. The drinks I had the zombie is was very yummy and really good! The atmosphere is great the service is friendly and quick! I really loves the space with plenty of parking and super clean!"}
{"text":"such an awesome bar! great food menu, wonderful helpful staff & speedy service! love the decor, music & ambience here. bartender Chris is on it! Greets everyone as they walk in, making sure cups are always half full, & if they're half emtpy he's asking if they want another! loved how helpful he was on suggestions for craft cocktails they had cause they were delicious! recommend for any kind of crown that loves a fun tiki bar/ restaurant!"}
{"text":"good time , great drinks, it actually looks like a tiki bar, you can smoke & drink on the patio, bathroom for men was clean ,Amanda is the best!!  hopefully she is working when you're there, best customer service ever! Plus he's cute"}
{"text":"5 out of 5 Stars places clean well-lit the food is fantastic the beer is cold the staff is extremely friendly"}
{"text":"Really want to like this place, and the fact that a tiki bar has finally come to the Akron area. I've frequented Porco Tiki Lounge in Cleveland, and had high hopes for this place, but Tiki Underground is subpar at best.   Very average, over priced bar food, especially considering the Winking Lizard/Fisher's are right down the road. Drinks were decent, but could use a few more tropical/fruity options.   Bar decor was nice, but the Keno machines/bright TV's kind of ruined the vibe. Seems like this place is torn between being a full blown bar/restaurant (like Sidelines used to be) and just a tiki bar.  Hopefully they're just working the kinks out since they're still so new."}
{"text":"As a tiki enthusiast, I was excited to check out a new-ish tiki bar somewhat close to where I live. I travel for work and try to visit every tiki bar I can find, so after Tiki Underground celebrated their first anniversary in business, I figured it was time to give them a try.  The decor is...interesting. Tiki meets sports bar? I was sitting near a big Carona sign promoting taco Tuesday and there were beer signs scattered throughout the bar. There were also signs promoting Keno, which took away from the tiki vibe. It was also super dark inside - and not in an ambiance building kid of way.   I stopped in for Pusser's painkiller week and was pleased with my drinks. They tasted authentic but were missing any sort of flair - a paper umbrella could have added a lot to my little drink.   My waitress seemed a little put out when we said we didn't want to order food. It seems like they have a lot of typical bar fare with some unique specials.   I think this bar has a lot of potential. It's just having an identity crisis. Not sure I'd go back unless they focus more on the tiki and less on the bar."}
{"text":"The people were warm and friendly and the drinks were utterly fantastic.  The menu is a work in progress - the coconut shrimp are good, the rest is a bit lackluster, and could be helped by limiting it to fare that only matches with the theme - if you're going to go with a standard like burgers, maybe burgers with pineapple rings or spam, pulled pork on Hawaiian rolls,or poi?  I'd like to see the out door area updated-  maybe surrounded by bamboo fencing, with tiki lights and outdoor speakers so it becomes a hidden oasis, and it would be fun to see an event like a pig roast - there's a lot of potential here, and the wonderful people and drinks are the perfect foundation."}
{"text":"It's a fun little spot, neat island decor. I guess I'd almost call it a dive-ish tiki bar, but not in a bad way. I think a lot of it has to do with the dim lighting inside.   We ordered food only, the drinks looked fun, but we passed on this occasion.   Kona Burger- my wife really liked this burger. It had pineapple and teriyaki sauce. Very fitting for the theme. She said she would order it again.  Sriracha Bourbon Wings- Awesome sauce. If I could buy a bottle of it I would.  Garlic Parmesan Wings- Not as much flavor as I expected and had more of a gravy texture(and kind of taste). I'm not sure what happened here. I even asked the waitress once to double check they were garlic parm, she confirmed they were   Tacos- I got the beef tacos. They weren't bad, but nothing special. It would have been nice if there were some kind of fish tacos, or something a little more Hawaiian. I guess I should have ordered something more tiki themed."}
{"text":"This was our second time going to the Tiki Lounge. The first time we were there it was pretty nice so we decided a few months later to make a return trip. I have noticed when I first entered that the atmosphere had changed. My family and I felt rather uncomfortable as we waited for an extended period of time to be seated. When the host came out he simply pointed at a table and says it look like that one was open and that we could have that one. Kind of like he was telling us to sit in a corner somewhere. We then waited even longer for hostess to take our order except for she never showed up. All of the servers were huddled in the kitchen talking and laughing amongst themselves. We ended up leaving as we did not feel welcome at all here. I welcome the owner to contact me if he has any questions orange X 2 what I have said in this review. This was not even a one star experience it was actually a star experience but I can't put 0 Stars"}
{"text":"First time visiting Tiki Underground, it was a good experience . I'd go back. We got tiki fries, which were awesome. Highly recommend. Didn't get any drink but cocktail menu looked great and heard a lot of things about their drinks.   It's very dark inside, didn't enjoy that, kinda depressing.   But overall wasn't bad . We will be back"}
{"text":"What a whirlwind great grand opening!   A little chaos to be expected with this full house but staff is doing great job putting their all into service .  Band and hula girl dancers perfect and fun for a Tiki bar.    Will return often!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to visit this place and had a great dinner. We were warmly greeted at the door and the service was outstanding. Planning to return to enjoy one of their live band performances. They have an eclectic and unique selection of drinks. The food was excellent. We really enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I've received some backlash from a few users regarding being a \"spy\" or a \"plant\"... I assure you I am not. I'm an out of town customer who's BfF loves Tiki and I go to these bars with her. I remember good bartender's names. End of story.   Five stars for the bar. Zero for the bartenders. I get it... you're busy, but there is no need to be exceptionally rude to a paying customer just because you don't have something I wanted to order. Not a big deal, I will order another item.  Me: are you able to make a hot toddy? I'm really sick but I'd like a drink.  Appropriate answer: no, we don't have the ingredients. Can I make you something else?  What actually happened: I don't even know what that is, we are a tiki bar... and walked away.  Last tiki bar we were at, we dropped over $200 on drinks, dinner and tiki.   This place won't be seeing a dime. Unless you are some local they know by name, I doubt they will be nice to you. Drive the extra 20 minutes to Porco. Ask for Tommy."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this little place. Unfortunately it didn't live up to expectations. Stopped in on a weekday afternoon. We where the only people in the bar. It was so dark we had to use our phones to see the menu. Server/bartender wasn't bad, he just wasn't friendly. Didn't help when asked for recommendations.  Food took awhile to come out. Especially since we where the only customers. Our appetizers came with our main course and we had to remind him about our chili cheese fries. Food wss nothing special. Just normal mediocre bar food. If we had only had drinks I would've given it a 4 stars. I've had better bartenders and would've thought he could've spent a minute or two with us considering it was our first time there. Drinks where good, but a little boring. I was expecting more flair .... to get a tiki cup you have to buy a $25 drink. I was disappointed in our experience. Not planning on going back."}
{"text":"The best drink I have ever had at a tiki bar. You cannot go wrong with the Bahama momma! I have been to other tiki bars and more often then not feel the drinks are borderline undrinkable either due to being too fruity or too strong. The Bahama momma was a perfect balance of taste and strength.  The bartender Chris was very friendly and welcoming which was nice as it has a local feeling. Chris made us feel comfortable and gave great service.  They do have food here but did not try it so this review is solely on drinks and service. I would come back here forsure."}
{"text":"Tried this once a few months ago and won't likely try again.  I realize they were just getting going and probably working out the kinks - but I wont try again.  The cleanliness was questionable (table top very sticky) and the drinks were very weak.  Mostly (how do you mess up bar food?) the food was pretty gross.  Tasted microwaved.  The chicken tenders were so overfried that they were CHEWY.  The lettuce was limp on the salad.  Almost inedible.  Sorry, but no."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great decor, great drinks and good food.   I hope they are around for years to come!  I have been to more than 35 Tiki Bars.  Tiki Underground ranks among some of the best.  It is still a relatively new bar and they are working out a few kinks along the way, but the bartenders are friendly and the drinks are excellent. Their variation on the traditional Mai Tai is fantastic as are all of the other drinks that I have tried, and the list is growing.     Tiki Bars are places to escape the real world for a couple hours and to step into a tropical wonderland.  They are meant to be dark and somewhat mysterious.  Tiki Underground meets this, with a sense of Aloha friendliness, good surf music and kitschy old surf and Sci-Fi movies playing on the screen.    I am new to the Cleveland area, but Tiki Underground has already become my favorite escape/watering hole in the Cleveland area.    Given a little seasoning, some time to collect more kitsch for the walls and continued outstanding events, this bar will become a legend in Tikidom.    Suggestions... work some exotica into the playlist. Kill the Keno, unless it is financially keeping the bar alive. Continue to collect cool stuff for the walls and keep refining your craft."}
{"text":"So happy to finally have a tiki bar without having to drive to Cleveland or Pittsburgh! Spend time looking around and you'll notice so many great, authentic, retro tiki details--from the numerous Witco pieces to the pendant lamps from the original Kahiki in Columbus (R.I.P). Food was good, bar food yes but good bar food. The onion rings were a favorite among our table. Drinks were very good, with house-made syrups and authentic recipes that did not disappoint. Really looking forward to spending more time here!"}
{"text":"Truly a fun place to check out. My husband has wanted to come here and we finally made the time to stop in and have drinks and dinner and were happy that we did!  Fun island decor and the bar area with the Tv has island movies and that was nostalgic.  Our server was very attentive and helpful with drink selections.  We shared Sweet potato fries and those were delicious and my husband chose the Kona burger and I believe I had a salad which was good.  In the other room was a band and that side was packed and the band sounded great. We will be back this summer with friends and glad we came."}
