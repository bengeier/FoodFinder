{"text":"I really can't explain my frustration with this place. TLD/DR - ORDER FROM SOMEONE ELSE. There are plenty of businesses that deserve your patronage. This isn't one of them.

FOOD is average at best. Think every stereotypical negative Chinese food experience and you've got this place. Super greasy, way to much batter, marginal at best sauces, dry crunchy fried rice, soggy egg rolls, bland dishes in general. Gotta feed a lot of kids? At least it's cheap BUT

DELIVERY and SERVICE are ATROCIOUS.
My last 3 orders were delivered incomplete. 2x at my place, once at a friends. I know I'm a softy for giving them more chances but my most recent experience was so bad I signed up to Yelp to share it.

The infuriating thing is that they fight with you about their error. The last two times we were shorted a chicken dish. At my friends place they actually requested to come into her home to see that it was missing! Ironically, they shorted the same dish 3 weeks later at my place. When I called to notify them they said it would be delivered in 30 minutes. Then they called to say they were sure I had it, but committed to 30 minute delivery. I called back an hour later and was told the manager was sure it was packed and they wouldn't be delivering it. I understand mistakes, but at some point you have to say that you don't appreciate your credibility to be called into question over a $9 plate of poorly prepared chicken."}
{"text":"Food was average like other Chinese places. Prices are about the same if not a bit cheaper, but it shows in the portion they give you. It's mainly a big bed of rice with 4 or 5 small pieces of deep fried chicken wings. Portions are pretty inconsistent, multiple times I ordered two of the same item and one box had two more pieces then the other, the pieces were the same size, just fewer pieces. To accommodate with the big bed of rice they over salt the chicken. Better salty than bland IMO.

 I'd come again, can get a quick Chinese fix for cheap I guess. I ordered take out the times I was in the area."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, all the noodle dishes I ordered had no sauce... very dry and flavourless noodles, that I could have made on my own.  When I have Chinese food I seek authentic flavours that I would otherwise not use in my own cooking. I ordered American chopsey (crispy noodles were not served on the side, and soggy by the time I opened the box), vegetable chow mien (dry, maybe 3 broccoli stems in the entire box), and pad Thai (an entire 2.5 pieces of tofu, half a peanut, and oddly, all noodles were cut into small lengths). If you're ordering from here, do not get noodle dishes!!"}
{"text":"Made a delivery order tonight and was advised it would arrive within 45 minutes. Over an hour later we called back and we're told the delivery guy still hasn't shown up for our food to deliver! Was told that they would be here in 10 minutes...I wonder if we hadn't called, how long would it take until someone noticed?"}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese food - very busy take out place - they deliver or you can order and drive up.  Their menu is online and they have tasty family meals.  Portions are very good and enough to split for 2 people - good size dishes with crispy veggies in the dishes (usually green peppers, celery, carrots, baby corn, bamboo shoots etc). Really as good as China Town in Toronto and Markham.  This is real deal Chinese food (tasty, not too greasy, fresh veggies, sauces are tasteful with just the right amount of spice in the Szechwan and Flavour in their Black bean sauce - their curry's are good also).  If you order a certain amount (I think $25 and pay cash) you get free Chinese Chicken Wings also with your delivery.

I highly recommend this place for Chinese Food.  Ajax sorely lacks an array of good Chinese food - this place makes up for it."}
{"text":"This place could be a hit or miss I've been going here since this place open when I was in high school. The food I got today was alright but they burnt the sweet and sour chicken it's still edible but obviously I had better! 

The only reason why go here because is the closest Chinese place near my house and the cheapest!"}
{"text":"Had this place for a while. Simple regular Canadianized Chinese food. Got sick the last time right after the meal. Can't ever go back now. Could happen anywhere I guess?"}
{"text":"Good food, great price, great service. Give them a try. Value, Service and Flavour, what more can you ask for?"}
