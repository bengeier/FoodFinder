{"text":"I went to have buffet for lunch on Dec 28 .. there was nothing to eat.. so I was sitting there for 20 minutes and scrounging for leftover.  That's not a way to serve food when you are charging full money ! Left there disgusted and pissed with these people ! It shouldn't take 20 minutes to refill buffet ... poor and lousy service and very average food !!"}
{"text":"I am very impressed by their price and quantity. Ordered a chicken karahi with 2 naans and a plate of samosas. Everything was freshly made and cost less than $20. Staff was friendly and food came in no time. I will highly recommend this place for indian cusine."}
{"text":"My mom has been to this place multiple times, and suggested that I tried it with her a few days ago. We got the \"Kings Platter\" Which came with tandoori chicken, chicken kabob, tandoori chicken chunks & non-tandoori, and some type of curry seasoned fish.... It was bursting with flavour, melting in the mouth. Their naan was amazing, and the rice cooked to perfection. There was so much food for 25$ we couldn't finish it all, and had to take out a lot of chicken. We ended it all wish rasmali, which was to die for! Will be visiting again soon"}
{"text":"Chinese is not as good as pure hakka Chinese restaurants. But its not bad either. Indian food was good. Green chicken tikka was amazing"}
{"text":"First the good things food is delicious now to the negative things worst service ever to slow and rude!!! Took forever to get the food and when it came just half came and the other food got cold! I asked for a take out bag and this rude woman with glasses rolled her eyes on me and told me such a stupid answer: we are a restaurant we don't have bags  I was like lol how u give ur food as a takeaway to ur customers lol  she should change her attitude else you going to lose guest and I don't think you want that but still food was amazing"}
{"text":"really good non vegetarian food for the price"}
{"text":"I tried this place when they had just opened I believe sometime in 2013, I ordered few items as a takeout, Chili chicken, fried rice, fish Pakora and something cannot remember, but the food was subpar , so I am not going back  The good things I noticed about the restaurant, it was really busy, customer service was great, good location, and tons of parking   Thanks for reading"}
{"text":"We gave this place two chances.  It's -15 C and they keep the front doors closed. We had to walk all the way to the side door with a child. I asked them why they keep the front double doors closed and their excuse was that customers on the door side might get a draft. The purpose of double doors is to keep cold out. I guess they didnt read the instructions.   The food sucks! No taste, just bland. Blah!   The side door is right in front of the menu so the food is was dead cold. The naan was not edible.   Service was non existent.   I don't think the food is worth more than $10 per dish. I would steer clear."}
{"text":"I was in the Heartland area, cold and cranky. I seriously need to know when, enough is enough.. apparently I make this executive decision to go to a couple of extra stores mean while I'm dying of hunger. I know what your thinking, don't judge me homie..*pshh*. Anyways, I desperately opened up the Yelp app, and read Bernie C.'s review and I was convinced to check this place out. When I opened the door to Guru's restaurant, it was empty but clean and the decor was quite nice. Once I was seated, I ordered whatever I set my eyes on, not exactly a smart move, since I always order way too much food. The server was polite but he isn't exactly server material. I asked him about the Shanghai noodles and he described them as flat noodles.. We went back and forth for a bit and I was starting to get irritated and googled what I wanted and he's like \"Ok.. Flat noodle\"... *crickets* I just let the server do his thing and finished placing the rest of my order. Across the room, there was another server who just sat at a table and was glued to the tv and all he did was fill up my water every 5 minutes, who are you competing with? Mandarin? My dehydrated friend was impressed with the water refilling service and stated this place is worth giving 5 stars (big mistake) lol. The appetizer arrived in sync with my water being refilled haha. The chicken pakoras were so deliciously spicy. Now where the heck was my speedy water refill service? My mouth was on fire and the server across the room was no where to be found. Within 10 minutes the Shanghai \"flat\" noodles (still got me the wrong ones), chilli chicken and manchurian beef arrived all at the same time. The food looked really dull and it all tasted the same. Very mediocre and not as spicy as the chicken pakoras. I've had better Hakka food but this is nothing special to come back for. My friend and I were running low on the H to the IzzO and the main server came with that copper jug to the rescue. We were so stuffed and asked for the bill. When the main server came back with the bill, the other server popped out of no where and started to clear our plates and knocked over a full glass of water on my friends crotch. Haha! So glad it wasn't me. My friend was furious and wanted a discount or even a proper apology but the server just whispered a quick sorry and snuck away. I asked my friend does this place still deserve 5 stars? I'm so mean lol. Seriously this place needs to hire better servers.. they are a mess and just completely boring people, sorry. This place is alright and I will probably try out their lunch buffet instead."}
{"text":"Appetizers and soups are great. Chicken pakoras are sublime. However, all other food is subpar and the service is quite possibly the worst I have ever received in a restaurant. They act as though patrons are an inconvenience to them. Aren't we the ones paying your bills? Rude, lousy service. Get the chicken pakoras to go.   Edit; their buffet for lunch is great for 10.95. Worth it; not a lot of options but for the price you can't go wrong. The service is still awful."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet recently, there weren't a lot of options but the food was decent and fairly fresh.  It was a Indian Chinese buffet and I thought the Indian food was tasty but Chinese food was a little bland.  I enjoyed the butter chicken and cauliflower dish.  Good value for 10.95/ person for lunch."}
{"text":"Tried the lunch buffet and it was great and cheap - $9.99.  It says $11.00 on the takeout menu, so I'm not sure if they reduced their price to compete with Tandoori Flame.  This is a very competitive area for Indian Fusion food with both Avani and Tandoori Flame around the corner.  Guru's is very similar to Bukhara on Burhamthorpe as it's a mix of Indian and Hakka Chinese.  Had this been my first visit, I would have given it 5 stars, but I have to consider my last review (mediocre at best) as well in the star rating.    Pros: Amazing butter chicken, goat curry is fall off the bone, tandoori chicken isn't too spicy and not burnt, fresh fruits and some Hakka food as well (chow mein, fried rice, , spring rolls and pakora). Also, good selection of stir fry veggies and potatoes.  Cons: Nothing really, except they only have 15-20 selection of hot food for their buffet, but it's better than too many choices with poor quality.  Also, they constantly fill up your water to make you full (not really a con) lol.    Average things: Naan.  It's okay, but nothing special.  Final verdict: Try out their buffet during the weekdays.  Cheap and good.  Edited: I put pakora's twice lol"}
{"text":"I wanted to hate on this place based on the first time I visited for take-out and I was completely ignored, but I just can't.  Came here for the buffet lunch.  Note that lunch starts at noon and continues until 3:00 pm.  I came for 11:45 and they were not ready.  This time, as I entered the venue, the owner greeted us and pointed us to a table.  I looked up at the ceiling and saw chinese umbrellas and lanterns hanging.  I look to the left and I see a great view of the Heritage House on Brittania.  I really liked the ambiance.  We were then served with cold water.  Given, we were the first customers at this place, so maybe that's why we were actually attended to.  I was really interested at their green chicken tikka and was hoping it was on the buffet menu, but it wasn't.  Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed everything I tried.  Loved the goat curry, the meat was still stuck to the bone, which makes for a juicy and flavourful meal.  I also loved the garlic fish, which was cooked hakka style, with curry and sweet and sour flavouring.  The spinach with paneer was also great along with the peas and paneer, which were a little bit on the spicy side.  Chaat papri was great, tandoori chicken and naan were also tasty.  So overall, I do like this place and I will try again.  I'll come back for takeout for the green chicken and see if I will be completely ignored again, which I hope for their sake, they won't."}
{"text":"they should retain to hakka chinese , which is moderately good. The  indian mughlai food is really bad, chicken tikka masala had no gravy, and chana masala had a cup full of salt. The parathas were served cold. Even after complaining about it, there was no difference. Really slow service, and loud horrible music. The waiters are not trained on the menu . The place has changed a lot and should be avoided."}
{"text":"Tried these guys and have been coming here regularly from past 4 months... todays service was worst and the staff was so rude... we always order so much food and table for two is small... so we requested if we can move to a bigger table for 4 since it was all empty... and their  server was like no its meant to be for 4 people... definitely wouldnt bother much about dine in... food is good so from now on will take away... #nevertippingthemagain"}
{"text":"We are almost a regular customer now!!! We like the foods here.  Good food at good price. Spicy (just what you expect from Indian cooking), aromatic and freshly cooked.   Some times it may take quite a long wait before the food is served. Keep average 20 minutes in hand after you place your order for dinner. Most of the servers are pretty helpful and polite (except few, but that is natural I guess)."}
{"text":"Its not even close to india food actually. Its not a bad experience at this restaurant but they could have done much better than this."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 5 times in the past 2 years, and all for the buffet (Halal buffet yaay!!!). Personally I think the buffet is an extremely good deal for the price; variety is limited I suppose however the items they do possess are all above average.  The following are my picks:  The tandoori chicken is great (4/5), the naan is AMAZING - probably the best - (6/5), the fish was above average (3.5/5) in my opinion but I feel that I set the standard very high in regard to seafood; likewise, the butter chicken was also remarkably good (5/5), some of the best I've had. There were a few other curries that were also decent but nothing out of the ordinary. Moreover, I never tried the deserts so I cannot comment on those.  What I really admired was that while I was seated I never had to ask for a refill on water, it was all taken care of ahead of time.   Overall, the experience was a positive one (4.5/5). If you're in the area, and you're hungry, it would be foolish to not check this place out."}
{"text":"I went in today for take outs and to dine in by myself and restaurant was not busy , just one group of family members was sitting . I waited there for 15 minutes or so but the boy and the girl who were working that time seems like not interested in coming to me asking about my orders . Very poor customer service . Horrible experience"}
{"text":"Worse customer service no matters.I went on friday the guy was working i ask him table one he just so gurmpy i am never going back."}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian options. Had their Singapore veg noodles, Chinese veg rice, Manchurian veg dry, and chilli cauliflower. All make for an excellent meal. Portions are quite generous."}
{"text":"This place is currently my favourite north indian restaurant in Mississauga. Guru's is has both indian and Hakka style cuisine, however I tend to only order their indian food, although I've heard great things about their Hakka cuisine.  This place is not meant to be any up scale restaurant but their decor has made it look pretty decent.  For some unknown reason each time I go there it has been quite empty with only 2 to 3 tables occupied, whereby I noticed that this place is very popular for take-out rather than sit-in since I did see numerous people coming in just to get their food to go. I love their north indian food. I usually opt for their thali, and they are happy to make any substitutions for me, such as swapping for goat rather than chicken or swapping nan for roti.  Their curries are amazing and not too oily and their prices are reasonable for the quantity given. A must go for sure!"}
{"text":"first time visit -  went for dinner last night, had the best butter chicken I have ever tasted! Tom Yum soup was delicious. Pleasant staff, prompt service."}
{"text":"Good quick buffet during the week for lunch. Fish is still their best item. Like the veg dishes as well. The rice were a little under cooked. But overall good"}
