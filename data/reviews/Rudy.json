{"text":"Rudys was a great experience and the burger was juicy and delicious, the Rudy sauce is great and I WANTED TO GO for seconds, really recommend this place if you are in the area. The staff was super friendly as well."}
{"text":"Saw this burger in someone's hand at Taste of Italy and despite being surrounded by beautiful cannolis, I had to get my hands on one. 

Honestly, this is the best burger I've ever had in Toronto. It took quite a bit of time to get ready but it was so worth it. It kinda tastes like In n' Out. OMg so gooooooood."}
{"text":"My favourite burger joint. You can taste the quality! They keep their menu super simple and the ingredients are minimal, you can really taste the cheese and the grilled patty mmmmmm 

The ONLY thing I don't like is their garbage is really small & uncomfortable to use."}
{"text":"I wandered into Rudy off the street in the pouring rain one night, and could not have been more pleased with my luck. I ordered the Valentino with a side of fries, which (without exaggeration) was the best fried chicken sandwich I've ever had. On top of this, the staff were incredibly friendly. I came into the restaurant alone and they struck up a conversation with me, pointing me towards their favourite spots to go when visiting Toronto. Overall, my experience at Rudy was fantastic, and I plan on going back every time I'm in the city again."}
{"text":"Reminds me of Shake Shack or dare I say, In-N-Out. Amazing burger and the chicken sandwich is the best I've ever had. My new go-to burger joint. (Sorry Burger's Priest)"}
{"text":"Jen had a hangover and their burgers and milkshakes brought her back to life. Highly recommend their burgers and that Jen drinks less."}
{"text":"Really tasty burger, fries were just ok. A very simple menu (which is a positive for me), and each burger is made to order so could be a long wait at lunch or dinner hours. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger. The poutine was okay, but $8 is a little expensive. I will definitely  order the burger again though."}
{"text":"Simple, charbroiled cheeseburgers. Perhaps slightly pricy for the size but then again probably worth it. Great addition to the strip."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in the city that could probably be a dollar cheaper. However worst fries in the city. I go there for just the burger when I get the craving."}
{"text":"Best burger in TO? No. Greasy, salty and tasteful at a good price? Yes. Enjoy the guilt."}
{"text":"The Rudy Burger is the closest thing to a Shake Burger from Shake Shack that I've been able to find in Canada. I just can't get enough. Best burger in TO (and these are bold words coming from a longtime Burger's Priest fan).

The deep-fried pickles are also delicious. Poutine is hit or miss (sometimes it's melted mozzarella instead of cheese curds). But if I wanted a killer poutine I'd go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I stopped in to Rudy for lunch. I had the Rudy cheeseburger. It's a straightforward classic cheeseburger with fresh lettuce, a nice big slice of tomato and a good sauce, on a nice soft bun. The patty was fresh and grilled perfectly: nice character, juicy yet slightly crisp on the outside.

I'm coming back with friends and family in the future. I might order the double next time as this one was gone too soon!"}
{"text":"Well, it's been at least 15-20 minutes and I'm still waiting for a single burger, and 6 ppl in front of me have been waiting just as long and their orders aren't done yet. I don't know what they're doing in that kitchen.
Even if this turns out to taste amazing, this is incredibly slow. (Friday night, but there's a total of 8 tables in this little place)

I am gonna be late for my next venue."}
{"text":"Rudy serves one of the most delicious melt in your mouth burgers I've ever had in the west end. Similar in taste and texture to Burger's Priest, minus the franchise. Everything is made fresh to order so it does take a bit of time for your order to be ready. Their shakes are super thick, a perfect drink on a hot summer day. A bit pricey for me, so it only makes an appearance in my stomach every few months. Tip: order through ritual to avoid the line-up!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for a quick bite last night. I ordered \"The Rudy\" which is basically a cheeseburger, at $6.50. The restaurant wasn't very busy and I'm pretty sure they were getting ready to close for the long weekend. 

My order was ready pretty quickly and was hot and fresh. The beef patty was fresh and quite crumbly, like it is with homemade hamburgers. The flavours were good although after one bite the bun became quite soggy with juices from the meat. There was nothing special or unique in terms of flavour or presentation, but nothing wrong either.

Overall a pretty decent burger, but nothing better than what you could make at home. $6.50 is a little steep in my books, considering there are other burger restaurants in Toronto (P&L, Burger's Priest) that have similar prices but far better burgers. 

Not amazing but not bad either. A solid three stars in my book."}
{"text":"Rudy single pasty cheese burger was decent tasting, although quite pricey at 650 for such a small size.  The fries are pretty good, good value for 350.  The poutine was prerty good, a good portion for 750, gravy was favorable with cheese curds.  The only reason would knock this down to 3 is to due to the wait.  Although they were nice they were very misleading in terms of how long I would have to wait for my order.  I asked them before I ordered on how long it would take cuz I had some one waiting.  They said 5 mins, great I thought.  22 mins later I finally got my food"}
{"text":"Been hyped up to go to Rudy after their delicious Instagram posts. Picturesque perfect burgers, tasty and juicy...but at a very steep price. 

If money is not a factor for you then Rudy is a great place. Their burgers are cooked to order and are beautiful. However - at $7 for a single cheese burger which is marginally tastier than a JBC from Wendy's @ $2.19...will not satisfy. 

Wish I could give Rudy a second chance, but their small portions do not justify coming back. Burger was decent however!"}
{"text":"Best burger we've had in a long time. Simple, juicy perfection. Deep fried pickles were burnt, though."}
{"text":"Very simple burger, but the taste is second to none. This is how burgers were meant to be made, forget the guac and peanut butter bs found in \"burger\" joints."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.5/5.0

Although this place has been opened for more than half a year, it has gotten quite a bit of hype recently as being one of the best burgers in Toronto and what seems to be the closest experience to Shake Shack/In & Out. After my visit this past weekend, I can definitely say that it was pretty much the best burger that I have had. Yes, better than Burgers Priest, In & Out and Shake Shack!

Everything from their Rudy sauce, melted cheese to their super juicy beef patty - all complimented very well together into one cohesive flavour bomb in your mouth. I also liked the fact that it came out piping hot. 

The only thing that I could see an improvement on is the bun itself as it is quite soft - so given the explosive juices from the beef patty, it was quite a challenge to contain everything into the burger. To minimize leakage, pick up the burger and flip it upside down before taking a bite.

Will definitely be back here again whenever I have craving for burgers."}
{"text":"I think this is my new fav burger place in Toronto. Simple, no nonsense burger. Just lettuce, tomato, cheese and their special sauce. The patty is smashed and has a super crispy crust which gives it a nice crunch when you bite into it. Taste is pretty similar to shake shack which is pretty awesome. 

Every time I've been here it wasn't too busy, which is nice, and the place has a few tables if you want to dine in. 

The fries were fresh cut but a bit too salty for me, but the poutine is pretty delicious. It's a little pricey but you do get quite a large portion. The fried chicken sandwich is also pretty delicious, tastes great with coleslaw and the sauce they put on top. 

They accept cash/debit and you can use the ritual app if you have it."}
{"text":"If you're simply looking to crush a juicy burg in under a couple minutes, look no further. 

Highlight: Have only tried the Rudy ($6.50) which is just a single classic cheeseburger but given that it's the name of the establishment, it's probably safe to call it?"}
{"text":"For a person who has eaten a lot of burgers around the world, I can say personally that this one of the best burgers you can eat. Its right up there in the range with Shake Shack and In'N'Out for personal burger satisfaction. Great smashed sear, secret Rudy sauce and Bun combination. Nailed it."}
{"text":"Rudy has one of the best poutines in town! The portion size fits right with the price and the cheese curds were squeaky delicious! Great service and i cant wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant with a few tables, mostly a grab and go type of place. Nothing much to talk about in this department. 

Service is order and pay at the counter and they'll either call your name with your order or bring it to you if you're dining in. It's a fast food place what do you expect lol. 

Food was ammmmaaaazzzzing!! One of the best burgers I've had; I love a smashed burger with a crispy crust to it, the Rudy sauce was also very good but what stole the show for me was the bun, it was so soft and even though the burger was dipping in sauce and juices the bun held together, no it did not even break a bit the bun just stayed in one piece. Poutine was one of the better ones I've had as well, the cheese is well melted and the gravy was nice thick and flavourful. 

Price is a little more steep than other places but I rather spend the extra $1-2 for quality any day of the week. 

I'll come back and keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"Rudy is a fast casual restaurant where you order your food at the counter and then the staff brings it out to you if you are dining in.  It's a no frills kind of burger restaurant with some paintings on the wall and a minimal menu selection (burgers, fries, and drinks).

We each ordered the Rudy Burger which consisted of a cheeseburger, lettuce, tomato, and \"Rudy Sauce\" and a side of fries.  Their Rudy Burger is on the smaller size of burgers.  Even when I saw their photos on Instagram, I thought that they resembled the ones from our American neighbour, Shake Shack.  I was really excited to try these and see how they fared. 

It didn't take too long for the staff to bring out our order.  

The burgers indeed did look like the ones from Shake Shack with a soft squishy bun and small size.  We tried the fries first and weren't very impressed because they were over-salted and also just didn't taste very good; they were just regular fries really.  Because there was so much salt on the fries (you could visibly see the huge salt particles on the fries), we banged the fries against its container to get as much salt off as possible.  

Next, we tried our Rudy Burgers.  At first bite, I really liked them!  My burger was a little bit on the raw/undercooked side but I was fine with this.  It made the patty really soft and I liked it.  I loved the cheese on it; it was so melted and tasty and did remind me of the Shake Shack ones again.  

Overall, I did like the burgers and understand the hype about them.  They're almost like the Canadian counterpart of the Shake Shack burgers (for now).  (They also seemed a little greasier in comparison too.)  Personally, I think that if someone hadn't tried the Shack Shake burgers, they would think the one from Rudy is the best thing ever.  However, since we were obviously comparing the two, these ones didn't hold up against the U.S. giant.

Rudy serves fried chicken sandwiches, pickle chips, and poutine too!"}
{"text":"Smashed burger. Delicious! Smaller than I thought. I could've eaten two double cheeseburgers. As someone else has mentioned, the patties come well-done but they're still juicy. Definitely will order again soon."}
{"text":"Was very delicious,now one of my favourite spots to come when Im in the area. Will always comeback !!!!
Chicken was very tender and crispy just the way I love my chicken poutine was very good loved it"}
{"text":"A super fresh, delicious, simple burger without the fuss or unnecessary extras. I came by with a friend yesterday to try this place out as it was on my radar for quite some time. We got the Rudy (cheeseburger) with added pickles, Rude Dude (double cheeseburger), Fried Chicken Sandwich, Poutine, and Fries.

The burger itself was very yummy. I ate the Rudy which was noticeably fresh and very hot. The burgers come out very vibrant and pretty! The bun was soft and warm, sauce good, and toppings fresh. Normally they don't come with pickles but you can add those on. I found the patty on mine was a bit too charred/cooked for my liking. Perhaps off the grill for a little less time and it would have been absolutely perfect!

Fried Chicken Sandwich was very yummy! Chicken was moist and very crispy. Hot sauce very tasty but not overpowering - coleslaw tasty.

Their poutine was very delicious!! I've seen photos before which look very appetizing, and the taste definitely did not disappoint. The fries are cut the perfect thickness and seasoned well before topped with a generous amount of cheese curds and gravy. It came piping hot!

Fries on their own were very good! Crispy, fresh, well seasoned, perfect cut :)

All in all, a great place to stop by if you're around and worth the trip if you're a bit out of the way!"}
{"text":"Weird experience, first when I got there, there was a closed sign opens at 12:00 which it was , there was no one inside, two huge outdoor planters inside blocking door, outdoor display sign inside as well so I walked around. Came back half an hr later same situation but people were inside??? Went inside 2 people in line waited about 8 mins to place an order 3 people working seemed to be working on a big take out order didn't seem to care about eat in. Only half a dozen items in their menu and one of them, their pickle chips unavailable. Paid $6.49 for a 4 oz burger. The meat was great the poutine was great but waited half an hour with only 2 customers in front of me. Really disappointed with service and price for what you get many other places for that quality of food but more and much much better service. Too bad."}
{"text":"It would be Rude not to review or try Rudy's! 

I have been meaning to try Rudy's for a few months now however, had yet to swing by until today. I had taken a peek of their menu and seen several reviews already about Rudy's so I knew what I was in for. I had heard that Rudy's serves up some of the best burgers in Toronto and after further review....it is definitely true!

Me and my sister both opted for the Rudy burger which is a cheeseburger with tomato, lettuce and rude sauce (similar to mac sauce from my sisters perspective but with a rude kick too it!) I opted for the Rude burger with sauce on the side as I am a picky eater. The burger itself costs around $7 and then you can add fries too it for $3.97ish we also got a can of pop for $1.59 (a little on the pricy side). We really did wish there was a combo price without having to buy the burger/fries and pop individually as it does come out to $13 and some change for the everything. 

Onto the burger...it was FRESH! By that I mean, the lettuce and tomato were fresh, the bun was so soft and fresh and the burger was cooked to perfection and cooked to perfection. I got full from just one burger and a handful of fries in which I shared with my sister however she could have gone for another burger. Everything about it was great!

Design wise, the place is a little small and with the open kitchen concept we did find ourselves sweating while eating with the smoke from the kitchen and the heat from outside - that did not ruin the experience for us. There are several places to sit and you can even catch some WiFI from Pizza Pizza next door ;) (Don't tell them!)

Overall, out of 10 these guys get a strong 8.5 for delivering an exceptional burger. We will definitely return and hopefully will see a combo added to the menu when we do!!"}
{"text":"Awesome !!! Everything was good. I had the fried chicken sandwich and my boyfriend had a burger. He said it was one of the best burgers hes ever had. Fries were amazing too"}
{"text":"Burgers at Rudy
Super soft, juicy, greasy
Smashin' hot and good!

Folks like to compare
Names like In-N-Out, Shake Shack
Why travel that far?

Uncomplicated
Just classic ingredients
That Rudy sauce, huh?

Dude, get the Rude Dude
Double patty madness, bitch
Keep calm and eat it!

{TTC: 506 it to Grace Street}"}
{"text":"We used to get the burger and the chicken sandwich, because they are both so damned good, and then we would share. Then we went double-Rudy and a Rudy. Now it's just two Rudy's. Always with fries and gravy. So good. Thank you Mr. Rudy. 

Update: Rudy \"hit me, baby, one more time\" yesterday. Yum."}
{"text":"Was in Toronto on business and checked out Little Italy. A bartender recommended trying a Rudy burger so I gave it a shot. I'm glad I did.

Got the \"Rudy\" and it was exactly what I was craving. A fresh ground beef patty cooked on a piping hot griddle. The patty was seared perfectly to give it a nice exterior crust and keep the party juicy inside. The bun was just the right flavor and amount of bread to soak up all the juices but not overwhelm te flavor of the beef. You can definitely tell this is freshly ground beef and not the typical frozen patty you find in so many restaurants.

The burger was topped only with cheese, lettuce, tomato and their Rudy sauce. Just enough condiments - I wish it had onions too, but the burger doesn't really need them.

Didn't try the fries, but saw them come out and they looked tasty. 

I will definitely come back for a burger when I'm in this part of the world."}
{"text":"This place has a unique burger and I love it.  They char their patty so its crispy on the outside and still juicy on the inside.  The flavor of the patty is like no other I've tasted.  The slaw is amazing, however serving it in tiny little ketchup dispensers and charging a couple bucks for it is not cool.  Friendly staff.  Good job guys!  Get a normal size slaw container!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times. The first time it was an amazing burger and I dream of eating that burger again. The second time the service was weird and the burger was burnt. The third time the burger was burned so bad I couldn't eat it. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Let's break this down. Poutine - 5 stars. Burger - 3 stars. Customer service - 0 stars. So I'm averaging all that out to 3 stars. The burgers are alright, but we tried this place instead of venturing to the Priest one Sunday, and my entire family agreed that Priest burgers are far better. We all loved the epic cheese pull on the tasty poutine, so we will probably be back for that. The main issue was service - they get some decent lineups here, so I ordered in advance via Foodora for pickup. Despite being told to pickup a full half hour after placing the order, when I arrived, they hadn't even started my order yet. And they were real dicks about it, no sorry, no make goods, just \"we got slammed\" and \"you are lucky we even took the foodora order, since we are so slammed\". I've worked in food service, and I know what it is to be slammed - but that doesn't ever excuse poor service. Don't take the order if you can't fill the order, and don't act like you are doing me a favor. Next time we will just go to Priest and skip the attitude."}
{"text":"I came here on Friday night and got the \"Rudy\" with fries. It was a fairly good smash burger and fries but the thing that ruined the experience was the smell and the wait. I get that Friday night is typically busy, but I waited at least 25 minutes for my burger and fries. When you think about how quick it is to make a smash burger, they must have a really inefficient process in place. The restaurant also smelled of grease as if there wasn't proper ventilation. 

I might come back if I was ever craving this burger but the place didn't leave a good first impression."}
{"text":"Rudy is a place for a cooked-to-order burger, fries, slaw and canned drink.

The burger ($6.50) is delicious, flavourful, and served on a soft (slightly sweet) bun. It is a bit on the smaller side, comparable to the average Burger from A&W in size.

The slaw is a decent, vinegar-based slaw. The fries are great.

Lunch time is less busy. Tables are available."}
{"text":"I got \"the Rudy\" burger and it was really good, probably one of the best burger places in Toronto. The prices reflect the quality, it's fresh. I would rather pay more for this then a crappy McDonalds burger"}
{"text":"Today I visited Rudy for dinner with a friend. We ordered the Rudy burger and a large poutine. The customer service was very friendly and the people working behind the counter were so nice! As for the food, it was so flavourful and you can see them making the burgers fresh behind the counter. Though we expected the burgers to be bigger (especially considering the $7 price), the poutine was more than enough to share between the two of us. Overall it was a great experience and one of  best burgers I've had! I give this place 4 stars because while the experience was great, the atmosphere was very casual (funny decor!) and on the smaller side so you can't really eat-in. They play great music though! Overall great place, will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"It looks like we have a new candidate for best burger in Toronto.

I'd been wanting to check out Rudy for a while, as virtually every picture I'd seen of their burger looked amazing. We arrived just after noon on a Saturday and the joint was empty. We immediately placed our orders and the food arrived a few minutes later.

I went with the Rude Dude (\"double cheeseburger, lettuce, tomato & Rudy sauce\") and it was glorious. The griddle-cooked patty contained an absolutely irresistible crust that I honestly couldn't get enough of. The meat itself was pretty juicy despite having been cooked past medium. The toppings were nothing short of perfect.

Sadly, the meal was not perfect. We also got an order of fries to share and they were, quite frankly, terrible. They were a little undercooked and completely underseasoned. I don't think there was any salt on there, which made 'em the blandest fries I can easily recall eating. We wound up throwing more than half of them away.

But that burger. Wow."}
{"text":"Wow
Amazing burgers 
Super moist and seasoned perfectly
Rudy sauce is great 

Rudy is right up there when it comes to smashed burger spots in the city.... I would say in the top 3 hands down ....

The poutine is perfect too ..... cheesy and loaded with tasty gravy 

We will definitely make Rudy one of our stops when craving a burger!!"}
{"text":"Yum! I really enjoyed my meal at Rudy and love the clean and simple aesthetic. Menu is easy peasy and sticks to the basics. We got two Rudy burgers (cheeseburgers), fries (one thick, one thin), and a strawberry milkshake. We definitely preferred the thick cut fries by the thins were pretty good too. The burgers were great! The Rudy sauce is a nice garlicky mayo, and the patty itself is somehow crispy on the edges and then soft and delicious everywhere else. The patty is on the thin side, so it may be worth trying the double burger if you're hungry. The shake was totally worth the calories :) Heads up - they only take cash or debit."}
{"text":"Tried my first burger at Rudy's and wish I'd been in sooner.  Love the fact that it has a simple menu - those places with pages of choices are just irritating. The Rudy cheeseburger was quite possibly one of the best I've had, which is also a bit irritating as it will make the next fast food burger feel like a major disappointment. Place was clean and the girl behind the counter was sweet and helpful - she also suggested the fried chicken sandwich so I'll give that a go next time."}
{"text":"First time trying this place, it was amazing! The Valentino fried chicken sandwich was great! Would def recommend if you're ever in the area!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I met Rudy, but whoever served me was very nice.

The meat is good in a crumbly way and the tomato is key.  Very good tomato."}
{"text":"Finally got to check this place out after contantly seeing their burgers on my Instagram feed. This restaurant is located on a nice stretch of College Street which could easily serve as a meal before or after being out for a few drinks elsewhere. I ordered the Rude Dude (basically a double Rudy) with thick fries. The fries you could tell were freshly cut,  blanched and were seasoned nicely. My girlfriend got the poutine. The Rude dude was delicious but a little on the greasy/messy side. I found the buns they use arnt quite dense enough to hold together 2 greasy Patty's with cheese - so halfway through my burger was already falling apart. A burger wrapper/sleeve that you see at some other joints could also solve this problem. Anyway that was the only drawback as I saw it. We'll definitely be back for another burger and to try their shakes."}
{"text":"A small, easy to miss store in Little Italy

You order at the front and they call you when your food is ready. Very misleading photos on yelp, it's the whole \"does not look anything like the commercial\". I got my burger and it looked sad and defeated. 

The taste of the burger was ok. Nothing really blew my mind. I didn't really like the bread. The patty had crispy edges which was nice, but not enough juice to make me feel excited about the next bite. The cheese tasted good and veggies were fresh. Overall a very average burger.

The poutine was actually not too bad."}
{"text":"A no frills place with a really great chicken sandwich. Very limited seating but I've never seen it so busy you couldn't sit. The burgers are good too and their fried pickles are a must try because they use bite size pickle chips not full wedges."}
{"text":"The service here is really good! Food is well made. It's made fresh so it takes a while to cook. 

Not much seating inside but it is quite spacious for a little place. 

The chicken sandwich is absolutely delicious! I highly recommend it! The fries are just okay. Nothing special. 

This is definitely a hidden gem in the area. They don't take credit card though."}
{"text":"Super fresh, classic flat top burger. Juicy patties with perfectly crisped edges and an unethically pillowy bun set the stage for a messy, but satisfying hamburger experience. What really makes it unique from other burgers in the city is the simplicity. Bun, patties, cheese, tomato, lettuce and their Rudy sauce. My only qualm would be the difficulty level of staying clean through consumption."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in GTA. Perfectly crisp and browned patties between soft buns = heaven. Canada's very own In and Out Burger and Shake Shack. Keep it up Rudy's !!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  The burger patties are 'loosely packed' so there's a really good texture when you bite into the burger (it's not hard like hockey pucks)!  Poutine is to die for!  They generously layer on the cheese and drench the fries in gravy ... man, oh, man ... I can't believe I didn't know about this place years ago!  I will definitely be back!  (But the staff has to let us know where to put the trays (after you've finished eating) when you dine in.  Do we leave it on the table or bring it up to the front?)"}
{"text":"Best burger in the city! The smell of the beef cooking makes me drool. I wish it was closer to me :("}
{"text":"best burger I've had in a long time!!!  can't wait to devour another one and try this chicken sandwich ppl are raving about!"}
{"text":"this is a burger place so i cannot give more than 4 stars but it is high on the taste side ranking. menu is relatively short and everything is relatively simple and basic but it tastes fresh and good."}
{"text":"Great, fresh burgers. Very reminiscent of Shake Shack. And the poutine is no joke...delicious fries, gravy and squeaky cheese curds."}
{"text":"Hands down the best griddle smashed burger in the downtown core. I've had them through delivery, have come after eating what's considered a full dinner at another restaurant nearby (2 days in a row no less), have come as a dedicated trip just to try the poutine. This place keeps it simple and does it right. I'm only deducting one star because of a very particular detail in the dining experience. If you have any sort of respiratory sensitivity or condition, I recommend getting your burger to go. The ventilation (or lack thereof) here can be pretty terrible with visible haze and smoke building up with just a couple customer's burgers on the griddle. Rudy's: please fix your ventilation---otherwise, excellent burgers."}
{"text":"Overall a good burger but not the best burger in Toronto. I ordered the Rudy which was a single patty cheeseburger. The beef is cooked fresh so it takes a bit longer to make which I was fine with. I just felt like the sauce was lacking. They call it \"Rudy\" sauce, couldn't quite identify the flavour but maybe because there was such a small amount of sauce on the burger. I felt like I had to add ketchup in which case why bother with a house sauce. We also ordered the poutine which was really good! It was huge so I was glad we split it between the 3 of us. The gravy tastes homemade so I loved that. And I ordered a chocolate milkshake which was really good too. I would come back here when I'm wanting a burger close to home but I would never say this is on the level of Holy Chuck or Burgers Priest. I like the simplicity of the restaurant and the staff are really really friendly. I enjoy hipster places with nice staff because that combination is so rare in Toronto. So, well done staff."}
{"text":"Very good very tasty burgers - reminiscent of Burgers Priest in all the best ways. Simple toppings loved that too. The pontine is a showstopper. Perfect fries with very good squeaky curd and delicious gravy. Pickle chips were a fun surprise - actually forgot to add pickles to my burger so added the pickle chips and they need to make that a menu option!! Will be back"}
{"text":"I feel like I got a different experience than the other reviewers here. I was excited to try their burgers as I joined the #mealplanTO program where I got to try a menu item for $5 instead of the original price. My friend and I got the Rudy burger (originally got $7.15). The presentation of the burgers were really nice and vibrant but I wasnt really wow-ed with the taste. I do appreciate the fact that they cook the burgers to order which makes them more fresh and jucier. Other than that, it was it for me. I will return to try their poutine as they are deemed one of the best poutines in all of Toronto!"}
{"text":"Rudy is a newly established purveyor of comfort food that focuses on a very streamlined menu of featured sandwiches. You can order one of three specialty burgers, or grab yourself a side of fresh cut fries ($3.50) or poutine ($7.50) which only comes in one size. Aside from beverages and water, that's about it. Plain and understated seem to be the theme at this College Street burger stop, which is the perfect set up for a surprisingly good meal.

Must-try items:
Valentino (Fried Chicken sammie)
Poutine

With a small TV and a nice scenic view of Little Italy, It's quite relaxing to sit down and sample the grub here. For the size of the diner, it is very open, clean, and welcoming. The straightforward approach and friendly customer service make for a classic diner experience. 

In keeping with the well thought-out concept, the sandwiches use a smattering of simple ingredients to deliver a nice punch of flavour. You can bet that the Valentino will become a customer favourite. Few chicken sandwiches are as juicy and tender, and they've chosen the right size and toppings to make it both filling and satisfying. I'm impressed at how well they do poutine, and will be back for one any time soon."}
{"text":"I need a Rude Dude! (A Double Cheeseburger)

Sadly The Ruby with one patty was small and cannot satisfy me.

Simple and well made with fresh ingredients. A little pricey for a small burger though at $6.50.

That \"dude\" at the cash was super friendly. 

Cash or Debit only."}
{"text":"Don't expect to see fancy decor, bells or whistles. This place certainly focuses all its energy on making a dam good burger, and they definitely execute. I didn't care for the poutine, I'd come back just for the burg."}
{"text":"Closest thing you can get to In-N-out in Toronto. True in-n-out burger fans, will know this is high praise. The simple cheeseburger (Rudy) and Double Cheesburger (Rude Dude) are very comparable to in-n-out offerings. All they need now is animal style.

Hope this place sticks around."}

{"text":"If you're looking for a straight up good cheeseburger without the fuss, then Rudy's is the place to be. Using local ingredients, seasoned with salt and pepper, drizzled in their special Rudy sauce, and served between two of the softest buns in the world, the Rudy Cheese Burger really hit the spot for me. People have been comparing this place to Shake Shack, so I'll let you be the judge of that."}

The best poutine in town."}
{"text":"I ordered the Rudy Burger.  It was made quickly.  Its a classic burger cooked on a flat top that gives it great crust.  No crazy additions.  Just good beef and melted cheese with lettuce tomato and burger sauce.  The way burger places used to make them."}
