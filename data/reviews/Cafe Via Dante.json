{"text":"We came back to visit Montreal in large part because the food experience is so high quality. Within this city setting, Cafe Via Dante is a jewel. The generational evolution from corner-coffee/community-center to fine dining is authentic - as is the prosciutto slicer on display. The knowledgeable staff lets fresh and artisinal ingredients speak for themselves. Sure, there are fancier decors and chandeliers to be had elsewhere, but it would be hard to find a more delicious and delightful dinner experience."}
{"text":"This place was not in the middle of the city, it was a little outside the center in Little Italy. The ambiance was very nice, many of the people in the resteraunt were very familiar with the owner so it is obviously a popular place. The owner was very nice, he came out and read us the meals, and he made great suggestions. I had a stuffed gnocchi which was amazing. The food came relativeley quick and was not too expensive. I highly suggest this place, if you are an Italian fan you will definitley enjoy this little place."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner as a group on a whim,

It was a fun night among friends. We mostly all ordered the same thing...

for entrée:

Stuffed gnocchi: by far the best entré, it was stuffed with beef, the gnocchi was soft and slightly chewy, it felt like eating fresh mozzarella balls without the cheesiness. The sauce was laced with mushrooms and olive oil, very nice, best dish overall.

Orange fennel salad: The second best entré, orange slices with fennel slices and sprinkled with toasted almonds. The dressing was light and subtle, it was a refreshing and original salad.

Porcini linguine: I don't know what happened, but the linguine was a bit tough, and it stuck together, felt like eating reboiled pasta, this was unusual as it did not jive with the quality of the rest of the dishes.



For mains:

Lobster ravioli: Ravioli was a bit too soft, but the rosé sauce with lobster made up for it, this was satisfying, although not the best ravioli dish I've ever had. We added a special house made hot peppers spread to the pasta that the waiter recommended, that really gave it a nice extra kick, this was the best main...

Eggplant lasagna: Lasagna made with eggplant instead of pasta, tomato sauce, tasted nice, except i don't like eggplant, it's just bland and fills you up quite fast if you eat too much of it... lol

For dessert:

Tiramisu and panna cotta. Tiramisu was average, panna cotta was rich and very nice. For Italian it was quite good here, but for a joint in little Italy in mtl... just average :) but a nice homey place with boisterous waiters, it's very inviting."}
{"text":"What an incredible evening.  Everything about this place is perfect!  Small and intimate and friendly, we felt immediately at home.  We started our meal with Insalata Dante, and it was fantastic: herbs, tomatoes, celery, radicchio seasoned perfectly and topped with paper thin prosciutto and croutons.  So simple and so delicious.  Our entrees were perfectly matched by a lovely Sangiovese.  Polenta with rabbit was divine- tender and well seasoned, we devoured every bite.  Pasta with seafood was loaded with shellfish and calamari, slightly spicy, and absolutely delicious.  The sous vide pork was succulent and served with spicy raab and creamy mashed potatoes.  We ended the meal with the most delicious strawberries in limoncello - perfection! Cafe Via Dante does not just serve delicious food, they create a memorable evening: the service is friendly and engaging without being overbearing, and the staff are so knowledgeable about the food (these are family recipes!).  We loved everything about this place, and we are already planning a return visit."}
{"text":"Pourquoi 4 étoiles ? Car c'est quand même un peu cher ... Mais c'est incroyablement bon !! Testez les gnocchis ou encore le traditionnel lapin !"}
{"text":"Stuck up bitches. The restaurant was empty but one table and they were concerned about fitting me and my girlfriend in before reservations began an hour and a half later.
-no written menus 
-pretentious waitstaff that hardly spoke to us
-bones in the fish to which I was told \"You should have told me before.\" No apologies or compensation.
Overall poor experience where we felt very unwelcome in the restaurant as foreigners."}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant - excellent food served hot, friendly and knowledgeable staff, good menu. Not expensive, small dining room. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Northern Food, served at its best, the host is gracious and likes to take special care of his guests. 
Hidden on Rue Dante, not much to see, a simple decor, but the food just wows. 
The menu changes according to seasons and the availability of the market, so the menu is on a blackboard, as are the wines, almost all offered by the glass also at reasonable prices. From the eggplant appetizer, fennel and orange salad,  the mains, rabbit and polenta, homemade pasta and shrimp that we enjoyed, everything was scrumptious. The last piece de resistance for me was their panacotta, oh yum! They had cannoli too, flavored of expresso. What a delight, ending the meal on a high note with limoncello, everything seemed beautiful."}
{"text":"I really enjoy italien food that's why my boyfriend and i went there for my birthday. I really enjoy going to a traditional, family italian restaurant. Our waiter was the grandson of the lady of had those recipes. Our dish was tasty, with a good presentation and a perfect service. The price is a little high but it's a perfect place to spoil ourself or some special in our life. If i have a special occasion i will think again about this place."}
{"text":"Great Italian food, home feeling, friendly service. Prices are about 18-28 $ for a refined main course. 

Went for a birthday, will go back for sure."}
