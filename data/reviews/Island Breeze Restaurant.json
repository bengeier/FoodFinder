{"text":"I like the restaurant. I never paid much mind to it before the my old neighbour and current owner took over and made it what it is today. Being that we're both from the caribbean, I love the caribbean approach he took with this restaurant.

The food and prices are alright, I usually stick to the chicken friend rice or roti. Good people and good vibes... usually."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place for the first time last week. Apparently, it's been there for 9 years! From the outside, it was hard to tell it was open and upon entering, it's pretty dark and dingy. Don't let that fool you. It's very spacious inside and has a bit of a \"hall\" feel, but it appears there is regular karaoke there, so the space lends itself well to that.
The person who waited on me (I did take-out) was incredibly friendly and made me feel welcome. She had mentioned that the person who had just come and left traveled from Islington and Steeles just to pick up doubles, so I know that'll be on my next order! Anyway, I got the chicken curry roti and was very pleased with my choice. It was tasty and hefty, and served quick enough. I didn't see much else coming out for the time I was there and waiting, but there appeared to be a few regulars that the bartender knew by name. I was happy enough with my food that I intend to go back and try something else. 

My four stars are based on the food taste, and the inviting person behind the bar. Can't wait for part two."}
