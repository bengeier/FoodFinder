{"text":"~2.5 stars overall but just foodwise 3.5 stars~  Very interesting name... I think there is famous place or restaurant in India with that name. When a colleague told me about the place and I looked into it... my words were lets go!  The menu is very funny and nicely done. The place itself is very small and is not meant for medium or large crowds.   For folks who don't know what Parantha is... its flatbread and there speciality is stuffed flat bread.   We ordered multiple things on the menu.  Crazy Kukkad (5/5) - Butter Chicken Parantha, the server stated that its their special and let me tell you its a must to have.  Shaukeen Punjabi Nawab (3/5) - Chicken tikka with omelete paratha  We also got a veg paneer paratha which I can't remember the name for.. and it was decent (3/5)  On top of that I also tried their Rose Lassi (3/5) and two of their Icecreams - Tooty Frooty Ice Cream (3.5/5) & Paan Ice Cream (3.5/5). The ice creams were good but I was disappointed with the toppings with the price they charged, as the toppings makes the ice cream Tooty Frooty or Paan flavor.   On other thing which threw us of was the menu had changed and they were still using the old menu. One of the paratha was suppose to come with daal but it wasn't the case in the new menu. As one of my friend was vegetarian and was looking forward to that but the server said no more. If the menu hasn't been replaced they should have just given it... all the sides were very small portion anyways but it threw off the mood.   The cashier also refused to do separate bill for just four people and which we were paying at the till.    For my Muslim folks - the server confirmed the meat is halal at their location."}
{"text":"We came around 8 pm and the place was PACKED. There was no space for anyone else and two other families were waiting for a table as well. The lady who took our order (for to-go, obviously) told us it would take 20 minutes. 45 minutes later, said it was not finished. The food was wonderful tasting, which brought up the review. Recommend the food for TAKEOUT rather than sitting in during dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out based on all the hype, let me share my thoughts.  My go to Parantha / Paranta is always mooli as I enjoy it compared to its potato stuffed version which is heavier. What I had at this place made me feel like gagging. The only thing I could taste was grease and little or no seasoning, it was the worst Mooli Paranta I have ever eaten.  I'm coming back to this place soon.   Wait, I know I just had the worst Paranta I have ever eaten, but there's more! We also ordered the Keema Sheema, Aloo and lastly the Butter chicken stuffed Paranta which were all stars. Good quick service with a cheeky decor, Brampton has a new gem on its hands.  Just fix that Mooli Paranta man."}
{"text":"The paranthas in this quaint little place were great. We tried 8 different ones. All exceot for one (pindi chana) we're tasty and just fantastic. We tried dosa, achari paneer, mooli, butter chicken, sharabi (it comes with JD) , meat with omlet on top, pindi chana and Gulab jaman parantha for desert. All had good flavours. The only reason I can't give this place a 5 is it's disorganized service. Service needs to improve. Servers need to be proactive in bringing watermelon refilling water, cutlery, napkins, etc. The process to pay at the drink cashier is ok but don't make paying people wait along with those who just came in to sit or order take out. This slows down the people who are finished to leabe faster and provide for another empty table. You oy have a few tables so you need to improve this process. Bring the bill to the table and let them go to the front to pay and get out quickly."}
{"text":"Very attractive name!! This is family run small restaurant, food (mostly parathas) is okay, even though the menu is full of fancy names.. you get the same paneer, aloo, gobhi and mooli parathas, portions are smaller as compared other places in Brampton. The place is not up-to the expectations as attractive as the name suggests. However, the place a neat and owner is very gentle to take feedback; hoping to see some new additions in the menu over the time. Good Luck!!"}
{"text":"Soo good. We arrived at 11am right when restaurant opened. We ordered the following amongst the 6 of us :   Mooli Alloo Chicken achari Egg bhurji Gobi 2 cups of cha Water  Mango Massi Sprite   Service was on point. It was clean. Space is a little small. They provide takeout service."}
{"text":"Found this place by googling Paratha. Very wide selection of parathas including desssert parathas. Parathas are stuffed with what would normally be side dishes like Channa, Rajma, Methi malai mutter etc. Each paratha comes with yogurt, picked onions and some daal makhni. Serving size is a bit small - so 1 paratha per person may be a bit light, ok if you split an appetizer. A bit tiny and basic on the decor but it's the food that counts. Overall a pleasant spot."}
{"text":"I would give it a 5 star rating had I not been there the second time and noticed a considerable difference in service within a month. During my first visit everything was amazing. The food, service and cleanliness. However, yesterday The food was still  but they have reduced the daal and achaar serving sizes. NOT COOL. Also the service. The waitress didnot serve us water when we were seated. And had a weird attitude. We ordered 2 paranthas and 2 lassis and paan ice cream. After she brought out one parantha, the waitress informed us then that they cannot make the other one because they ran out of ingredients. This is unacceptable as the other person had to wait another 10 min for the food. If something is not in stock let the customer know right when you take the order.  And then they ran out of paan ice cream.  but the one scoop served was on the house. Anyway just let the customer know. Please try to maintain the same standards."}
