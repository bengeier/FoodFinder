{"text":"This place is close to home,
I mostly enjoy going to hang out with friends and family.
The food is pretty good for a Pub/bar atmosphere...
I usually order calamari and chicken with fries but they're pretty good in flavour!
Its really nice to go in the summer and sit outside enjoy the night.
Good for drinking, mostly beer...the Beer s awesome!
I wouldn't say they are the best for random cocktails,
they make whatever's on the menu really well... but sometimes you order a different drink and they wont make it correctly.
However they are awesome when it comes to making their home menu drinks, my favorite drink is the Irish Trash Can ;)

I would not recommend going on a long weekend/holiday since they are super busy and the line outside is usually long so you have to come for dinner first and stay for drinks later in the night. 
I was there St. Patty's Day and found the waitresses were busy and flustered, she tried to charge us twice for our drinks after we paid her already.
I ordered a Tom Collins and got a gin and tonic ;/
and there was no toilet paper in the washroom...
the attendant did not care... fortunately the crowd is friendly so girls were bringing napkins and sharing them through the line..

SO like I said... its totally awesome on any regular day..
but if you come and you're waiting more than 5 mins in the line....
expect it to be busy and not so perfect. ;) cheers!"}
{"text":"Visited again after a horrible experience at Coopers (was craving some wings). Service was good as before. Wings are very big. Not very saucy and not the best tasting but good bang for your dollar. They have good daily specials as well. Also had an order of mozzarella sticks that were way too expensive for what they were. Place was much more livelier this time around."}
{"text":"The band is on fire tonight! Oh and so are the sweet potato fries with chilli mayo! Delish!

Service could be better...but thank God for alcohol!"}
{"text":"I got denied entry here years ago after coming here more than a few times because they thought my real ID was fake. This place is nothing special, nothing makes it stand out over any other Irish pub. They do charge cover on occasion which is unheard of for a bar."}
{"text":"The service here is sub-par.  There is one particular server in which we've been there three times with a rotten attitude.  We were seated, took us about 15 minutes to just get menus. Another 20 minutes to take our orders!  By the time we got our food it was 1 hour just to get wings.  It was not busy in the dining or the bar area.  We've experienced this type of service twice (thinking the first time was just unlucky).  I wouldn't recommend.  If you want to feel out of place, then take your chances."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out. They have Jameson shots for $4 throughout the year. Have great spinach and artichoke dip."}
{"text":"Hi, good spot for some friend time, good beer, snacks and friendly staff.  This is not a five star restaurant so don't be up tight, it's a nice relaxed good place to just enjoy friends and decently good nosh!"}
{"text":"Failte's is a great place to have a drunk old time. Saturdays are always insane at this place, so make sure you try to get out a little early if you want a seat. The last time I went here, I was told to arrive for 9:30pm, and at 9:45pm we got the last booth inside. The patio was totally full by 10:15-30pm. The atmosphere is pretty alive. I do agree as well that the drinks are slightly more pricey. This is one of the more decent places in Mississauga to have a good time on the weekend."}
{"text":"A couple of my friends took me here a few years ago, when I was only seventeen, for dinner. I asked the waitress what would be good to get, and she said the fish and chips. Honestly, the food was only OK. I wouldn't go there just for the food.

What I would go to this place for, now that I can, would be to have a couple of drinks and chill with my friends. It's a great place for that, given the low lighting, and that everyone else is also doing just that. You can also watch Hockey here on appropriate nights.

I tried going there for dinner again but was rejected because it was a 19+ Karaoke night. So I figure they have event nights etc, worth checking out. While I waited at the door for the bouncer to turn away our sleazy attempts at appealing to his nice side, I caught a glance of a few shouting laughing drunk redhead boys. 

And yes! This is an Irish pub with actual Irish people in it. 

I've only been here twice, so I haven't taken advantage of everything this pub/restaurant has to offer. But I definitely would be up for it."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night at around 7:00 for drinks and dinner. They didn't have a large enough table to accommodate our party and ended up pushing a few tables together, which was fine. We ordered appetizers which were fantastic. We noticed as we were sitting at our table for w hile the light in the display case beside our table kept dimming on and off. It was really odd and annoying. We got our meals a little while later and everything seemed really fresh and tasty except the poutine. The gravy and cheese was hard and solidified and made me feel sick to my stomache. It's like it was sitting there the entire time our order was being getting hard and gross. The service could have been a little better at being attentive, but everyone else enjoyed their meal and in the end we did have a nice time. By the time we left at 9:00 the place got really loud and noisy and the front of the pub was packaged with people. Next time I'll order something different- go with the burgers/philly cheese steak if you're looking for something tasty to eat."}
{"text":"The service absolutely sucks here. Bartenders serving other people that just walked in, while I had to wait for what felt like forever just to get a neat shot of rye. The server gave me attitude, and forgot my cup of water. Instead she would rather be flirting with this guy at our table. Clearly these people did not want my tips. The server ended up giving someone else my friend's credit card, so my suggestion is cash only. But realistically, that's for any busy cheap place on a Friday night. 

In addition, the food was gross. You could taste the fact that it was previously frozen, and probably not even thawed/cooked properly. 

The live music was the biggest joke. Some white people covering Beyonc√© and Sean Paul. It was definitely entertaining, but probably not in the way the band expected.

The only thing I did like about this place is the fact that security was chill, the patio was heated, and the bathroom attendant was the only hardworking person in this place. 

Thank god I was with amazing company, otherwise I would not have had a good night at all."}
{"text":"Location was clean and staff was kind so that was good. I bought the wings, they have amazing flavours! I'd say their wing quality could be better, but what the meat lacked the sauces definitely made up for."}
{"text":"Failte is like the bar equivalent of comfort food. It's something you need to lift your spirits, it's always good, and you have a tendency to indulge in it.

I came here a couple days ago with a colleague from a board I work with, in the midst of a raging storm that was taking out trees left and right. While the pub was seemingly empty when we came in, we soon felt right at home when the waitress greeted us.

The pub is roomy and cavernous - the kind of place you could find a dark corner to get lost in if you were looking to avoid people. There are plenty of nooks and crannies in the place, punctuated with TV's mounted overhead and the bar itself in a central \"nexus\" within the building.

It had been many years since I last came here, but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. I ordered the special (chicken on a bun), while my associate ordered a reuben for herself. I was amazed to see that the portions were absolutely massive - my sandwich had to have weighed a good pound or so. I found myself trying (and almost failing) to keep the contents from spilling out onto my suit, while my companion found herself full after eating half her meal and not even touching the fries. The special is one of the best meals I've had in a long while - great value for the price.

Despite a few dodgy moments in terms of service (we waited way too long to get our food), the rest of the experience was stellar. This is easily a good 4.5-5 stars, only conditional on the service and time of day.

It's well worth a visit to Failte. Aside from being a sort-of institution in the Mississauga City Centre, it justifies its own longevity and delivers the goods when it comes to filling food."}
{"text":"After passing by this place many times over the years, I finally had the opportunity to try here. Unfortunately, there was nothing too memorable to rave about the place or entice me to come back, hence the low rating.

It was quite empty on a Monday (holiday) night, but despite that, service was quite intermittent. I do like that they have a patio outside and an enclosed outside area where we sat. Strangely enough, the table we sat at was sticky (? greasy) so we had to move ourselves to another table.

Food: Ordered the pub platter to share with friends. Hugely disappointed as taste was generic and greasy. Frankly, it wasn't quite worth the $19 spent for the small portion of 3 varieties - onion rings, cheesy peppers, and mozzarella sticks.

Alcohol: Probably stick to beer. I wasn't smart and ordered a strawberry limoncello cocktail - bad mistake! I didn't like the taste at all. Even if I did, the volume was quite little despite the $9 price tag attached. I've definitely tasted much better premium drinks at this price.

Consensus: Nothing stellar for me to venture back, considering the numerous pubs/restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I came here for wings today. 

They have a decent wings deal Monday through Wednesday's. It's half off wings, making it $0.75 per wing or $6 a pound. 

They have 15 or so flavors which is not bad for an Irish pub. The wings are pretty good sized, however in my batch I got mostly wings and less drums. 

I ordered two pounds split between suicide and whiskey BBQ sauce. The suicide was disappointingly mild and actually a bit one-note. The whiskey BBQ sauce however was quite tasty. 

Overall very solid wings. Good sized and meaty. They are also cooked well. 

I can't really comment on the service.  It was a bit non-existent, but then again it was a quiet Tuesday and we seated ourselves in a more remote part of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I went there with my excoworkers and to my surprise the place is very big... it is nicely decorated and different areas with different things.

the service was good and food was not bad. I have wings and they were huge and well priced."}
{"text":"Live music, lots of seating, a decent patio and a 25-30 year old crowd. Failte's is a decent place to spend a Friday or Saturday night.

I have been here a few times but my most recent visit was for a 30th birthday party. We had a little room reserved which comfortably held 20 of us and overlooked the band. 

The food was only okay not doing anything too wrong but lacking any real flavour or seasoning (we ordered sandwiches and wings). The service was good though.

I strongly dislike the fact they have a girl sitting in the girls washroom in front of the sink that hands you towels for your hands and expects tips. Nothing against the person, just the concept really irks me at a far from upscale pub. It somehow seems degrading too.

Little bit of information that won't be relevant to most of you but the bouncers were actually pretty nice. By the end of the night we had some pretty intoxicated friends in our group and at no point did the bouncers throw anyone out, just politely and patiently ushered people out.

Friday night is a little quieter than Saturday nights though both charge cover. They have a massive parking lot where you can leave your car overnight."}
{"text":"As much as Failtes can be a bit scuzzy, with drunkards everywhere, it's a pretty fun place. You're almost guaranteed to have a good time if you go with friends. 
The staff are generally pretty cool and fun. They have live music most nights, and the bands are generally decent cover bands playing a variety of rock and alternative hits. They have a great selection of beers and a well stocked bar. The patio is a good size, but gets pretty crowded. 
The only crappy thing I can really say is that I hate paying the 5 bucks cover... but then, somehow I always get sucked in and I do..."}
{"text":"I would give this pub a 3/5 because I think it's a bit expensive for it's value. The music is not always the best either depending on the band, however, it is typically live. Cover is charged after 9PM. The food is standard. I went with a large crowd so the food took a while and did not all come at once. In the summer the patio is nice though and there are many places to sit to avoid the music if one should not like it. If I was not a broke student, I would probably have enjoyed it more."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place many times. Parked in it's parking lot, even gone in for a quick pint but never ventured past the bar area at the very front of the building! Boy was that a mistake!

Have you ever seen this place? It takes your run of the mill Irish pub, turns it on it's side, kicks it in the arse and sends it back to Ireland for a lesson how to be an Irish pub - this place is for real!

Not only does this bar keep going, and going, and going... literally everytime you pass a door way or an entrance another room opens up before you. I kept walking around in it this weekend until I found the restrooms around back, I had walked for almost 10 minutes. When I asked the bartender/manager the capacity of the place she informed me very specifically it was 327!!! 327 is not a regular pub! That's a HUGE bar!

We were just in for pints and I was pleased with their beer selection, both in the bottle and on tap. Their Guinness was some of the best I've had in a long while, it was poured properly, in stages and left to settle before topping it off - being a seasoned traveler of Ireland and a fan of Guinness I can appreciate these things!

Best of all they have a massive stage around back for live bands on Friday's! To get a perspective, think about the stage where Holly met her husband in PS I Love You ... (Yes I've seen the bloody movie... ya wanna fight about it?) It's like that, but with more room for drinking, singing, brawling and general good times.

As I'm told they're quite packed on Friday nights, so I may have to pay them a visit for some wings and beer on a Friday night some time!

Fun fact I learned on their menu - A pint of Guinness has only 197 calories, which is less than the average glass of Juice!

Slainte!!!"}
{"text":"When it comes to good places to grab a drink with friends, they're few and far between in Mississauga. Failte (means welcome in Gaelic) is your traditional Irish pub that attracts crowds of all ages. They have a decent pubfare menu with a wide variety of brews on tap. 

On weekends this is one of the best spots to grab a drink with friends of meet some locals. Get there early on Fridays and Saturdays because it gets packed (they also charge a $3 cover after 9pm). Weekends see a list of live cover bands to entertain the masses.

There's a large outdoor patio, open in summer for dining and heated in the winter for the smokers."}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere. There are some private booths as well as an area that looks like an old stoney castle in the back.

Service was super friendly, and the night I was there, there was a special: $5.25 (taxes in) for a pint of Mill Street Organic, with 25 cents going to Movember. Sold. It was a Thursday and they had  DJ spinning music around 9ish.

There's tons of free parking in the lot on the side.

Apparently they have a happy hour that includes $5 Strongbow, Killkenny and Guinness pints from 4-7 on weekdays. Too bad I don't work in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I'm usually pretty easily satisfied but both the service and food were some of the most horrible I've experienced anywhere, especially the service, the waitress we had was sullen and hostile, never checked up on us, and got almost angry when we asked for the most basic things, like napkins. The food took an eternity to prepare and was cold and unsatisfactory when it finally came. It's too bad really because in terms of atmosphere and location the establishment does have potential but we were all so disappointed we left before we even ordered drinks. Girls night was a bust."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and service seems to differ each time.  Sometimes I get great service and sometimes I get very bad service.  

However, the last couple of times were really bad.  One time, I waited about 30 minutes for my dish.  Then there was another time, where it was a group of about 20 of us and we all ordered their wings.  It took over an hour for our dishes to come out.  It was their special for the day so I would expect it to be a lot quicker.  Then we tried to split bills, it took the server like at least 5-7 minutes to punch it into the system.  It took forever to get out of there.  

While the service has been pretty bad each time, I have to admit their wings are delicious a good size and maybe I'll give it one more go soon since they are so close to my place."}
{"text":"Overall a great experience. The food is solid, environment is spacious and comfortable, and the service is impressive. My waitress/bartender Monica was working hard, and giving all of the guests her attention. She was very attentive to when drinks needed refilling or when dishes could be cleared. 

If I had to get nit picky, the food didn't come out fast, BUT if you are looking for fast food, Square One has a food court across the street."}
{"text":"I recently came here with a friend and why is this place so cold? I literally took my shoes off to sit on my feet to warm them up. I was still wearing my jacket cause of the cold. My friend was still bundled up too. 

I might as well have a drink outdoors.

Mike Holmes, Restaurant Takeover... HELP THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Good vibe even on a lazy Sunday.  Great food with good range of choices, comfort options and many different type of burgers (duck, lamb, beef and vegan)

Bad ass nachos topped all the way up!

Good service and lots of nooks and crannies to hang out in. In the last decade + it's maintained it's calibre. 

Would avoid thurs to sat cause of the cover but every day of the week there is specials for drinks and food."}
{"text":"It's not often that a place is so poorly serviced that it prompts me to write a Yelp review. This place succeeded in that respect. I went there last night (a Tuesday) to catch up with some friends. There was a sign on the door saying the draft machine was broken (booooooo). There was no hostess to seat me and I had to wander about looking for my friends. I'm guessing there were only 2 servers that night which was definitely not enough. After ordering our food (very mediocre fare) and drinks, we asked our server for separate bills. She just rolled her eyes and said 'uhm that's gonna take a while'. We chose to wait because we were really ticked off by that point. She brought some weirdly split bill saying her manager did not allow her to split items. When we tried to pay with our cards she said they didn't accept debit cards (huh?). Finally I ended up paying cash with the waitress glaring at me as if daring me to tip her less than 15%. 

I always ask myself after going to a new place, 'Would you come back here?'

NO!"}
{"text":"Was in town so I popped in. This place is but a shadow of its former self, the staff are nice, but they changed the food supplier and food handling I guarantee it . I came in for a few pints of draft and wings and woke up in my bed hours later running to the toilet."}
{"text":"What a sad little place with no service? When you stand there with a fifty hand, you think they would lunge at the offer of a brew. Nope. No service whatsoever. Two times a lady, but three times I don't go back. Sorry folks, this place ain't worth it like a few years ago. It was fun then but this place is always more and more quiet each time i go. I smell a slowly dying bar near square one mall."}
{"text":"Wound up here pretty late on a Thursday night for the first time. It is a really cool little space! I was so pleasantly surprised!

I love all of the little nooks and spaces! Nice little patio, the bathroom was clean, the server was friendly, the DJ was decent, and there is lots of parking right there! 

As I came by here after an after party, I needed no further booze and something to eat on the quick. I ordered a Pepsi and a poutine. The poutine was okay. Decent size, not even close to authentic, but good to absorb the alcohol in my stomach. Had I been completely sober, I probably would have been disappointed. Now as for the pop... 

Herein lies one of my big pet peeves with bar and restaurant staff that use a soda gun. First of all, the Pepsi was $2.50 for a standard size glass. Fine. After I was finished my poutine, nearly done my Pepsi, and my friend was about 2/3 done his beer the waitress took the empty plate and asked if I wanted \"a refill\" on my pop. I looked at the glass thinking we'd be leaving soon but figured while she's there and asking I might as well so said, \"sure, why not\". When the bill came I was charged for two Pepsis. Now aside from the fact that that is just plain cheap - considering the actual cost of the drink is about 5-cents - it's rather irritating. I would not have accepted the offer of \"a refill\" had I been aware that I would be charged. Generally, if I say I would like \"another one\" I expect to pay. If it's \"a refill\", the assumption is that they are refilling the glass that I already paid for. Whatever. Now I know. And you do too. Don't accept a \"refill\" from a waitress here unless you want it to go on the tab."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a long time so I thought I'd come by again . It's a pretty good little Irish pub in the heart of downtown Mississauga sqaure one area ... Food is actually decent pub fare . 
Nothing like a nice pint of Guinness and shot of Jamieson ! They have wing Specials on Monday and Tuesday and $4 everyday Jamieson !
Live music on Friday nights aswell"}
{"text":"We just left failtes after a girls night out. I can say that the food was really delicious. At first I was really hesitant about going here thinking it may be very traditional Irish food but they had all kinds of pub food. I ended up getting the buffalo chicken strips with fries. The chicken strips were very thick and tasted fresh not frozen. I got the medium sauce on them and found them to be super tasty, not hot at all. The fries were just like New York fries and very delicious as well. We were sitting at a table next to the door and at first when we arrived it was all fine but by the time we left it was like being crammed into a sardine tin!!! The table beside us was so close that there was no space to walk between and to make matters worse they were there for a bachelorette and were super loud bearing penis blow up dolls and bubbles. The place gets really loud and after a long week at work it's not the best place to go unless you plan on getting plastered. But definitely a great atmosphere with delicious food!!!"}
{"text":"Had the worst experience at Failtes. Heard good things, read some reviews on this site, but when I went there with 20 friends just after 9 pm on Saturday night... we got in just fine, everyone paid cover (which is absurd) but then one of the bouncers - said that three of our friends did not pay and wanted us to pay again. There was also no space anywhere. The staff were rude and not accomodating. The bouncers here are douchebags, flat out. They are on some kinda ego trip. You're in the service industry, you're supposed to serve. Take it easy, you're an Irish Pub in Mississauga not an upscale club in Toronto. I go to a pub for friends. laughs, beers and an easy time, not to be stressed out because we're being berated by the staff and not being accomodated. Also paying twice.. really? We shouldn't be paying even once at 9:15 pm. NEVER AGAIN. Please don't let me force you to take my money as well as twenty of my friends money... We went to West 50 and were accomodated VERY WELL. At that point we now had close to 30 friends with us, they got us a TABLE. Served us drinks/food all night. We will be back there. This place, sucks. Don't go."}
{"text":"Theres a cover charge of $5 on Saturday nite as they have a band playing. We got here 1hr 15mins before the band started playing and had to pay the cover. Outside seating was great but the interior needs upgrading especially if you ask for a cover charge. The service and food was good."}
{"text":"It's a decent local pub. Gets really busy on weekends. Although I've never been here for a full meal, we always stop by for shots. Good vibe and friendly staff"}
{"text":"This place has been nestled away in an office building in the heart of Mississauga and although its been there for sometime I have only recently stopped in. A now popular spot for local Sheridan Students this unique Irish inspired pub was a rather delightful surprise to me. Given I only shared a pitcher I was told by my friend that she highly recommended the food and the menu boasted a few items that intrigued me but I wasn't planning on staying long so I opted out of munchies for this visit.

First and foremost I want to comment on the space alone; the sheer size of this place is impressive with a very intricate layout with plenty of nooks and crannies to tuck yourself away in. It seems like a very intimate setting that still has the convenience of a casual ambiance and the option of large tables and different areas for larger groups. The decor offers a coziness to the large and somewhat dimly lit venue, it has a very eclectic approach with some very unique features that would require a thorough walk through to fully appreciate. The bar itself is one of the very few I have seen that is a full free standing circular bar located directly in the center of the space offering access from all sides.

 With daily specials, live music and events this is a bar I most certainly will be visiting again"}
{"text":"Went here last night for some drinks and DJ Ononymous. The place was quiet as was to be expected with the Thanksgiving long weekend. 4$ Jameson shots are nice. Place is not too expensive. Will be going back another time for sure."}
{"text":"Love this pub! The layout is pretty confusing, and it feels like a giant maze when you visit for the first time. That's part of its appeal for me because it's quite unique in this way. The location is ideal, smack dab in the middle of City Centre, right beside Square one. 

The atmosphere here is incredible- fun, friendly, and relaxed. This place is ideal for groups. It's usually pretty busy, and there aren't as many pubs in Mississauga, so making reservations is the sensible thing to do for large groups. 

They have a huge selection of beers, cocktails, wine, whiskeys, shooters, and signature martinis. A superb selection, and an extensive menu. Makes me happy :D Their food menu is also quite appealing. Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere- what else could you ask for in a pub?"}
{"text":"Faite's is easily one of my favourite pubs.  The atmosphere is great on weekends and the staff is friendly.  On Friday and Saturday nights (and sometimes on Thursdays, I believe) they have live bands; the music's always great and the drunkies end up on the dance floor (guilty!).  On Sundays they have karaoke, which is pretty fun too!!

The food is ok.  The drinks are somewhat on the pricey side - I'd suggest you pre-drink if you intend to have a messy night, and just get a couple of pints while you're there.

Also, the place gets very busy on weekends.  I went there on a Saturday night with 5 friends - we stuck around for a few hours, but were never able to get a table.  I don't believe they do reservations on weekends, but don't hold me to that - they might for birthday parties.

Overall, I'd suggest checking it out - always a great time there!!"}
{"text":"A great place to meet with a friend to have a beer and catch a live band.
Great decor, good selection of beers and bar food make this place worth 
coming too. Even though it draws a younger crowd its still a fun place to
come and see a live band on the weekend.
If you are looking for an authentic Irish Pub, this place is for you. Lots
of free parking and great location next to Squrare One."}
{"text":"I do like this place.. However i m not a big fan of having to pay a cover charge on a Friday. Maybe I'm a cheap ass.... But you are already paying premium price on the pints of beer.... 

The vibe is good though and its a damn fun time."}
{"text":"I don't drink... so this would probably colour my review :D  But I went here with a large group of friends to enjoy their company, bar food, and the scene.  What they didn't mention was how many drunk people are here from the local business towers.  I looked over to the right of me and saw one of the financial service reps I've used in the past and say how they were slurring their words.  Well... and they put you in charge of financing mortgages!  Ok then!

We were on the patio which has a great view of the Square one parking lot (lol).  It's far enough from the road that you don't get too much inhalation of the exhaust fumes.  The interior of this place is a lot of dirty brown brass and wood paneling... it's not one of the clean modern bars.  Nope, it's old and they like it that way.   When I went, it was starting to get crowded at 10:30 pm but we were still able to find a table on the patio.  It's quite the casual place... don't expect anyone looking like they're heading downtown Toronto.  It's all about jeans and t-shirts.  The atmosphere is ok.  It wasn't a place that I normally would say try to socialize with random people.  Most people were focused on their own table or they were drunk that it's pointless to say hi.  It's an ok place to sit in a crowd with good friends.  Speaking of crowds, I would say it's older (as in early 30s) on the night we went and there was a few young people but they were mostly monopolized by the cougars (lol!! free entertainment!).  Live music is also done and it can be good (supposedly).  The night I went, it was rather forgettable as I can't even recall the name of the band (and I wasn't even drinking).

Bar food was edible but not great.  We had the sweet potato fries and nachos.  Sweet potatos weren't super crispy or salted well.  I've had better at fast food places.  The nachos had lots of cheese on it but they kinda gelled together which made for interesting textures.  I wasn't a fan.  Considering the cost of the sweet potato fries, it's seriously overpriced.  Drink prices are fare (according to my pals). 

All in all, it's a standard pub in the middle of the burbs.  Perhaps I can convince my friends to head to the shiny new pub in Heartland Centre, Fionn MacCool's.  At least it's shiny!"}
{"text":"I give this 4/5 for a place to drink and dance on a fri or sat night.  They have live bands here, which vary but are mostly rock, alternative, or irish jigs.  This place usually gets crowded, and a bit rowdy with drunk 25 - 30 year olds.  Nice little dance floor in front of the band that usually gets filled.  

Takes a while to get a drink sometimes.  But this place is fun, with plenty of nooks and crannys to hang out and chat with someone over a beer.  4/5 cause I've always had fun at this place.

{"text":"I am not going to lie, I didin't want to like this place. I was ready to write a brutal review and pun the whole \"they put the FAIL in Failte\". I was going to flaunt my Toronto bar eleitist muscle, and rip this place new asshole.... 

Alas, I am embarrested to say that I not only liked this bar but it I lived in Mississauga (thank god I don't!) this would probably be my watering hole! 
So why am I being such a bitch to this place? 
Well they have a lot of elements that tend to go wrong...

1- It's in Mississauga... nough said

2- Not nough said? you need me to elaborate? Fine... The last bus from Sqaure One to Toronto on a Saturday night ends at 1:11am. So if you plan to party later, prepare to call a cab and shell out some coin.

3- Cover was $3... no cover is typical for a dive bar or lounge, $5-$10 is normal for a descent bar in Toronto... $3 is a preverbal mystery!

4- There was a cover band there ALL NIGHT. I thought this would surely make this place suck (think Bier Markt on  Saturday night!) The band and the singer were suprisingly good and had an impressive repretoire of covers including:
*Billy Jean (MJ)
*Time of your life (Green Day)
*Don't Stop Believing (Journey)

5- The place was crowded... and I mean CROWDED. It's not even 11pm and there are barely any chairs, tables or standing room. By 12:30pm there was a line around the block to get in... TO A PUB!!!

Once I stopped being so anal I realized this place was pretty cool and despite its possible failures it managed to be a fun hangout. The best part of the night was when I realized that the line of men standing behind my table, was the lineup for the mens washroom! That's right ladies... no lineups for the girl's loo, just the boys (Payback!). This sort of thing only happens at hockey games or on full moons.

All sarcasm aside the saving grace for this place... the thing that really made it worth my night was our AMAZING waiter Kevin. Kevin looks like the type of guy who just got out of prison and works part-time at a motorcycle shop! This guy was so attentive it was ridiculous. At some points of the night I didn't even realize my drink was done and he was right there with another one ready to go!

We ordered food, and I got the grilled chicken sandwich. The sandwich was pretty good, although the chicken was a bit dry, but the fries and gravy were awesome (next time I will just order fries and gravy).

If I ever find myself needing to party in Sauga again I will recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"It's your average Irish pub. I've some here on a few occasions with co-workers and had a good time. The food is your run-of-the-mill pub fare but is tasty and good value. The beer selection is good and the staff are better than average."}
{"text":"Failte's is one of Mississauga's \"hot spots\" for a casual night out.

Really though, it's hit or miss. On weekends it gets fairly busy, so you may have to wait in line, and cover is $3. The ambiance inside is not the best, it's the classic old-looking wood and exposed brick Irish pub. I do like that there are lot's of different rooms though, which means you can move around to alter your experience.  They also have some booths tucked into various nooks and crannies if you're looking for something private. They have a good outdoor option as well- there's an upper deck that's well protected for those chilly nights and then a large lower patio.

Failte's has live music and this can be a great addition to your night or an absolute headache. There's a very small dance floor in front of the stage so you can get up and groove if the mood hits you, but it tends to be more of a sit (or stand) and listen atmosphere. 

Failte's has a very random crowd. The age range here is huge- from those freshly ID'd youngsters to fairly old (sometimes creepy) men. There's a large variety of people who frequent Failte's- hipster,  cougars, jocks etc. There's not really a \"mix and mingle\" vibe here, so you definitely want to bring a good group along and make your own fun!"}
{"text":"Don't go here unless you want to die.... Worse place I've ever been to in my life. The server got mad because we asked to split the bill. Was apparently too much work to ask of him. So I reported him to a nicer hostess and he followed outside to argue with me... Inciting fear into customers?"}
{"text":"After my first terrible experience with Failte's, I swore I would never go back. Two weeks ago I found myself back at Failte's with a friend. We weren't planning to go for drinks here but Earl's and Moxie's were full.

We arrived around 10 pm and it was pretty slow...it is early after all. We chose to sit at the bar and the bartender attended to us immediately. I didn't know what to get so I asked him if the Jolly Rancher martini was good. He was friendly and funny and said it was popular because he always makes it but he doesn't drink it because it's girly haha. 

The pub got pretty busy when the live entertainment started to perform, which was around 11:30 pm. I had a pretty good time catching up with my friend and the bartender was great. 

I guess I can go back to Failte's again."}
{"text":"There are not a lot of places in Mississauga to grab a drink and unwind.  This is the place to go for a beer or two and catch up with an old friend.  Karaoke is a regular happening, so if you are annoyed by people that cannot sing I would suggest that this is not the place for you.  It's pretty close to places like Earl's, so if you get bored you can easily hop over there."}
{"text":"This is a nice chill place to go for a drink. The food is mediocre and the drinks are great BUT the service is painfully slow! Only visit if you have time on your hands because the service is slow and not that polite."}
