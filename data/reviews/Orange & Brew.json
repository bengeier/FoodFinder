{"text":"OK, I have been working my way through the menu and looking for more flavor ... Not a lot of luck, but I did have a pretty good Ty Cobb salad yesterday.  But .... Ty Cobb salad, Pepsi, and 20% tip = $17.  Ouch!  That's about 1.5-2 lunches anywhere else. There is less expensive stuff on the menu, but I had a taste for a salad and really wasn't paying attention to price."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves orange and brew. Personally I think it is rather hit or miss."}
{"text":"The building is lovely.  The remodel after Buttita's is as good as one can do when turning a lovely restaurant into a sports bar-style restaurant (though why one would want to do that is beyond me).  And that's where the good stuff stops.
In short, the service and all things related to it were glacially slow; the food, when it arrived, was mediocre at best -- and missing key elements (one whole order, and other parts).  This restaurant cannot possibly last if they don't figure out how to greet and serve customers, or get the food that was ordered actually to the tables.
The full story.
Upon arrival, we found a vacant hostess stand, then a long walk down the hall to the dining room along which we saw no one who works there.  Luckily, we ran into friends who assured us that we could seat ourselves.
After waiting at our table for some 15 minutes, we used a bit of self-help, and accosted a waitress to ask for some menus.  After another 5-7 minutes another waitress finally showed up with menus and silverware. She did not offer water, or to bring us a drink of any sort - just plopped the menus down and disappeared.
Quite some time later, our waitress arrived, apologetically, and took our order.  We ordered an appetizer (cheese fries), and three meals: 1 burger (would have been on wheat bread but despite the menu, they had none), one 1/2 ribeye (which the menu says was supposed to be thick, but which was certainly not), that should have come with some interesting sounding twice baked potato casserole, and one individual pizza.  My daughter ordered a diet, I ordered water, and my husband ordered a beer.
The water and diet only took about 7 minutes to arrive.
The appetizer might have arrived after another 10, but the food runner carrying the plate of cheese fries tried to deliver them to another table. Having learned he had the wrong table, the lad just took them back to the kitchen.
Eventually, the cheese fries arrived.  They weren't as hot as one would like, and for the price, there should have been a LOT more cheese.  The fries were no better than I could make using frozen crinkle fries from the grocery.
Within 3 minutes of the appetizer's tardy arrival, some of our food arrived.
The burger (but not the beer), and my steak with vegetable, but no potato casserole, and no pizza.
The waitress arrived, and asked if everything was there, we told her \"no\", and pointed out that we were missing the beer, the potatoes and the pizza.  Ten minutes later the beer arrived.
My husband then went up to the window where the pizza would have been put up for a food runner -- no pizza had been ordered.
So. 
The steak was fatty, but moderately tasty, if only tepid.  The broccoli was cold, the burger was not as good as you can get at, say Hardee's (despite costing twice as much). 
We never did get the pizza.  Or the potatoes.  
I DID offer to come in as a consulting manager to help them teach the staff how to actually wait tables......"}
{"text":"Waited at least 45 minutes for food that never came. Many tables, including ours, left without eating. The open kitchen allowed us to see dozens of plates sitting for 15 plus minutes under the heat lamps, some were stacked on top of each other. Some tables had a couple people served while others didn't get food. God bless the waitresses, they were doing the best they could."}
{"text":"ok I'm upgrading my review - it only takes one dish and the Oski wow  wow wow shrimp blew me away. It was perfectly executed: hot, crispy, with just the right amount of sauce: imagine healthy buffallo wings - and it was a busy world cup final atmosphere.
 Who says you can't get decent shrimp in the Midwest?  My mom does - she's from the Philippines and hasn't been here since 1975 - I'm bringing her when she comes next June for my wedding. Oh and about her - she's a serious wine snob. Guess what? They serve Decoy wine - one of the best wineries from Sonoma. Didn't want my positive review for server Jessie to get lost - she was very kid friendly and efficient. Manager Derrick and staff are young, friendly, and motivated to make this place the best sports bar in south central.  They tell me to come back for the thin crust stone baked pizza. I certainly will."}
{"text":"Management treats their employees terrible! Service is bad because manage net doesn't properly train employees. Then they cuss and degrade the employees in front of customers! Worst place ever."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant. My sister and I, along with our boyfriends, came to visit U of I for my brother's 21st birthday. We thought this was going to be a fun, new place to take him for his birthday dinner.

After standing by the door for about 15 minutes because there was no \"seat yourself\" sign and no one was by the little desk, we finally went into the restaurant and realized it was seat yourself, although it was a Saturday night and with 6 people it was petty hard to find a spot. 

Our waitress was just the worst, and she never told us her name so I can't even mention it. She came to our table TWICE, once to get our orders and once to give us the bill (after we had to track her down to ask for it). When the other workers brought the food out they brought them out at different times and my sister's boyfriend never even got his. After having to track down random workers to get the food (it ended up being wrong anyways!) and to get sour cream, SILVERWARE and other things we were all just laughing at how bad our waitress was. We never got any re-fills on our drinks and when asking how much the vodka sprite was no one could even tell us. 

Overall this place was super disappointing and we all couldn't wait to leave."}
{"text":"I am writing to air my complaints about the very poor service that I received at the Orange & Brew tonight, after calling and notifying the staff 5 hours in advance that we were coming in with a party of 15 in celebrating my daughter's 23 birthday the staff's attitude and our server (Courtney) lack of communication (over half of the items on the menu were not available, and we were not told until after we placed our order and awaited our food) was absolutely horrible! After visiting this restaurant before, I knew for sure that we had chose the perfect place. NOT!  We had to literally wave our server down, sometimes calling her name, as she stood in conversation with her fellow employees. This experience has spoiled our high expectations of this resturanat and eventually spoiled the evening for my entire family. 

The only reason I am giving Orange & Brew 1 star is because I had to. Over $200 for nothing! Never go to this place if you don't want your mood to be ruined!"}
{"text":"I went to Orange & Brew last night with a group of friends to watch the Illini game. The atmosphere was nice, they have pool tables, plenty of TVs, and nice decorations. 

Halfway through the game our waitress comes over to tell us that they can no longer serve alcohol because their liquor license expired. She told us we could finish our drinks that we had already purchased, but she couldn't serve any more. She suggested we come back on Monday...it was Saturday night.  I am not sure how a situation like this happens.  If your main business is beer, wouldn't that be something you would be aware of? Moreover, how does the license expire at exactly 9:15pm? 

This was my first experience here, and while I would consider coming again, it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a good review mainly based on service and atmosphere.  We have been here twice to watch games which is what this place is perfect for.  It's big enough that you don't feel bad taking up a table for a whole game and the servers are totally cool with you staying until the end of the game (we continue to buy drinks after we eat, so that probably helps).

The decor is really nice and it's a very comfortable restaurant.  My concern is that it is SO big I'm not sure if they'll be able to stay in business because besides it being a really good place to watch a game, the food is just okay.

I've had the Orange and Brew Beef sandwich (just ok) and the Buffalo Chicken Wrap (good- I'll probably get this again).  Both came with the crinkle cut fries that another reviewer wrote about (probably were frozen, but I enjoyed them).  My husband had the pizza (just ok) and the BLT (just ok).  So, out of the four things we've tried, we'd probably only order one of them again.  Not great.

Regarding the beer selection- yeah, it's not that exciting, but I think the name \"Orange and Brew\" is more of a tribute to the Illini than it is a reference to their beer selection.

I would love to see this place re-vamp their menu to be a little more interesting and maybe not so big- maybe pick a theme?  I think they're going to have trouble staying in business if they don't."}
{"text":"I came here for mom's weekend, which could contribute to the poor experience I had, but nonetheless a restaurant this large should be prepared for crowds. It was awkward because there wasn't a waiting list when we came, it was still \"seat yourself\" so when a table cleared up we tried to sit down but a server told us it was already \"claimed\" and then suddenly there was a waiting list. Why not just have a waiting list and a host at all times? Seating yourself doesn't really make sense in a restaurant this big.

I understand this is a new place, but the servers and bartenders seemed to have little knowledge of the menu. My mom ordered wine 3 times, each time it came more than 10 minutes after she ordered it and the wrong wine was given to her... The third time the correct wine finally arrived (after she changed her order to an easier, more recognizable wine) but by then we had finished our meal and were ready for the check...

The food is pretty unimpressive as well. The \"salad\" my sister got was just lettuce with a few nuts tossed on top of it. The nacho appetizer, on the other hand, was delicious.

The bar and atmosphere of the place has so much potential, and it's a great location, but the service and food were simply a let down."}
{"text":"I haven't had the full experience here, but this place is an awesome place to drink beer, eat some food, and chill. 

The beer selection isn't all that vast, but it's sufficient. Skeeball, pool, darts and plenty of  tvs are available and there's seating around the pool tables that is very comfortable.

The space is great and the service was fast for us on a weeknight."}
{"text":"The definition of average. Average food, average service, average beers. I live around the corner, so we come here to watch the game sometimes. I wish their beet selection was better given their name. I do see the menu changing, so I know they're trying to improve and are listening to feedback."}
{"text":"The staff was wonderful here. Our waitress Whitney was oustanding. Food was great also. They were very accommodating  to a couple of Hawkeyes  and Buckeyes fans who were in town for the weekend to have a good time with friends. We will be back."}
{"text":"Disappointing! I believe the earlier reviews nailed it......cheap frozen food cooked without any type of sauce or spiffing up included. Bland and overpriced so you better come for the TVs. Our waitress was efficient and timely. I hope she is keeping her options open because I can't see this lasting in C-U. There are too many tasty options available."}
{"text":"We went there on 12/7, which I'm assuming was their first Saturday open. It was definitely not a good experience. There was no one at the front to tell you to seat yourself or not. We walked in at 7pm and the place was pretty busy. We left at 9pm after finishing our food and paying. It took 2 hours from start to finish just to get a meal. Luckily we weren't in a hurry. The only good points are the building is very nice and there are a lot of TVs.

 The bad- We requested 3 times to have the TV changed to a game we wanted to watch. 3 different people said OK, and it was never changed. When we were ordering, I asked the waitress if the rib eye sandwich was an actual steak, or shaved. She said she didn't know and instead of asking someone else, she just said she wasn't sure and starred at me. It was very uncomfortable. I was disappointed and got a burger instead. We had a 30 minute lapse where we needed a beer and no one ever came. Finally we went up to the bar and got it ourselves. They never brought out my buddy's salad. The burger was plain and way overcooked. I ordered a side of creole coleslaw which was just normal slaw. 

My advice- It's the little things they need to get right. Add some seasoning to your burgers and cook them correctly. Put a sign up that says seat yourself. Train waitresses to be professional. Get more staff because an hour and fifteen minute ticket time is just comical. Get more beers on tap, and include a beer menu with the food menu (it takes 30 seconds to drop one in each menu, don't be lazy). Finally, pay attention to details with peoples' food orders. It's bad when every review mentions not getting something they ordered or a mistake in the order.

A guy, who I think is the owner, was walking around and asking people if they needed anything, which is good. I'm hoping he reads this and takes note because I'd like to go back due to the atmosphere and location, but I might wait a month or 2 for better service and food.

EDIT*** I went back in early February, approximately 2 months after opening and my first experience. The service was A LOT better. I got the Pizza and it was pretty good. The beers kept coming. 4 beers + Pizza was around $22+tip.I can see myself going here again now..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried Orange and Brew for the first time this weekend, looking for something new to try in the Champaign-Urbana area. The wait staff was very friendly and was prompt to take our order.  The Oskee Wow Wow Shrimp was a big hit for us, and we were excited about our entrees. I got the Orange and Brew Beef Sandwich, but found it to be pretty tasteless.  My boyfriend got the BBQ Pork Sandwich and also said it was just alright.  This place is great for grabbing a few drinks and watching sports games with friends, but the food is nothing special."}
{"text":"We had a great time on Saturday (1/04) to watch the afternoon Illini basketball game and celebrate a birthday. Had cold beers and tasty chicken nachos. Wanted a bit more of each sauce.  The waiter was a bit too attentative, though we got what we wanted quickly.  I was shocked when the bartender did not know cost of beers, reporting probably $4. They were $3.25.  The prices are reasonable. Yummy Nachos were inexpensive - $4.25 / half order, plenty for two. 

A nice crowd of all ages was there. This is a large building. Once ppl get familiar with the place, they will know to walk in, take a seat where they choose. I had no issue, yet I went there when it was Jillians. The bar area is nice, easy to see ppl and socialize. We sat in a dining like area with a tv at the table. We liked that for our gift giving get-together There is also a larger open room I will sit in next when i want to mingle. I liked the big bathroom. And, I want to return. 

I'd rate this a good 3.5. It's a clean with decent ppl."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Took my wife here for dinner and was disappointed. No hostess, seat yourself? Onion rings were good, food was average, fries were crap. My wife's order was wrong, I had a draft beer and it stood empty during my entire meal. The waitress tried to take my wife's beer while it was a quarter full. Got the bill and 1 burger was $7.50, the other was $9. Waitress wasn't sure why there was a difference. She found out it was because I ordered lettuce & tomato on my burger. .75 each additional topping? No thanks. Will have to improve to stay in business."}
{"text":"Great food, cool atmosphere, but some of the worst service I have ever received. Our waiter didn't know a thing about the menu, what they had/didn't have, couldn't keep track of what we ordered, and was unbearably slow. I think his name was Thomas- surprised he is still there"}
{"text":"I've been here for 7 minutes and am already disappointed in the service...

Also, there is a lack of vegetarian options..."}
{"text":"This place really upsets me! I want to like this place but I just can't! It's call Orange and BREW but yet their beer selection sucks! First time I went there the waitress was awful and the food was awful....so I waited about a month to go back to give them a chance to get it together. Sadly I've been there 3 times now and the food hasn't got that much better..BUT the staff has! Oh and the atmosphere makes no sense... It looks like sports bar meets an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar decor (I counted 22 -- TWENTY-TWO -- television screens) and ambiance. Service here was the best part of the experience: Our server was prompt, friendly and helpful. The food seems also to be somewhat typical of the sports bar. I had a burger and fries and they were tasty, if excessively greasy. I will go back, though, and try the shrimp, because this place is located so close to my house.

Update: This place closed before I had the chance to go back."}
{"text":"This is definitely going on my \"will never return\" list.  I went there with my mother for lunch today.  We both ordered the same thing, the Orange and Brew beef sandwich. 40 minutes later my mothers food came out, mine didn't.  I sat and watched her try to eat this sandwich that was sprayed with butter or grease of some kind but was not grilled? Clearly it should of been browned on both sides, but no.. it was still white with soggy grease on it.  10 minutes later my food arrived, same thing. Disgusting grease trap sandwich that tasted like sh!t hole. This place is whack, i hope it goes out of business soon and something good opens."}
{"text":"Staff here was trying hard but really needed training. Our server appeared at awkward times (much too often in some cases), yet couldn't answer some questions about the menu, forgot common items.  

The nachos were huge but mediocre.

No real craft beer selection to speak of.

Maybe worth one more try (there are lots of TVs, so maybe a good place to watch a game), but disappointing since it seems this location still has potential for a great pub or sports bar."}
{"text":"Update:  The owner reached out to me in regards to my previous review.  I didn't respond back, but I had since eaten here again.  The service was a lot better and as usual the food was great.  In my opinion the best Indian food in C/U."}
{"text":"Not overwhelmed. Joined a group of friends already there and waited 10 minutes till someone noticed me and brought me a water. Waited close to half an hour and nobody ever came back to take my order. Oh well, wound up going elsewhere instead.

For a place with \"brew\" in its name, you'd think their beer menu would be more extensive too. Lame."}
{"text":"This place has LITERALLY the best deal on nachos I have ever seen in my entire life. A half-serving is ginormous--bigger than your head--and it's only costs like $4.75. I don't even want to know what a whole serving would be like. Seriously, more people need to know about this. There's no point getting nachos anywhere else in the C-U area."}
{"text":"First of all, for a place called Orange and BREW, I was expecting a better beer selection.  They only have a few beers on tap (bud, miller coors, fat tire and guiness are all I remember) however there are two pages of wine selections.  Seems like they might be shooting for an older crowd.
The food was decent.  I had an order of hot wings, which were average, and a \"build your own\" burger.  The build your own concept is nice, but that is the only option.  It would be nice to have some \"already assembled\" burgers to choose from.  My wife got the ruben, which was horrible.  We sent it back and the manager told us there had been a lot of complaints about it.  The service was ok.  They forgot to put in the wings order and we were comped a drink.  This sort of thing happens in a new restaurants I guess.  Overall I think I would give them another chance and hopefully they get their shit together."}
{"text":"While I'm tempted to give a 1-star review for the experience, I would bubble it up to a 2-star based on the atmosphere.  

The restaurant is deceivingly large and nicely decorated, with adequate parking, a good sports bar feel, clean, and not overly loud.  Now, the volume may have had something to do with the fact that there were only 3-4 tables and about 4 people at the bar, but nonetheless it was a comfortable volume. 

Unlike the situation mentioned from an earlier reviewer, there was a prominently placed 'seat yourself' sign at the entrance.  There was very few people at tables, so we sat near the bar.  It was a weeknight but a home basketball game but there was no discernible pre-game crowd.

There appeared to be 3 bartenders working and a significant number of waitstaff; about one for every 2 people in the restaurant.  Our waitress introduced herself promptly and took drink orders.  Despite there only being four of us and being seated literally less than 10' from the bar, it took about 10 minutes to get an iced tea and 2 beers.  As noted, for a restaurant with \"Brew\" in the name, the beer selection is poor.  

Upon taking our orders, waitstaff disappeared to parts unknown, only to be seen fleetingly like timid woodland creatures, and we were forced to resort to a combination of primitive hand signals, napkin semaphore, and pointed looking around to signal our desire for service.

Meals arrived after about 20 minutes less one salad, to which the waitress commented \"Oh yeah, that's weird.  Do you still want it?\"  Beverage refill and reorder took an additional 10 minutes.  One of the party was having wings and we requested a couple additional napkins, which she brought after being reminded once 7 minutes later.  Burger was mediocre, smallish, and dramatically overcooked.  Wings were small and undersauced but had decent flavor.  Pub chips were soggy and so oversalted that they were nearly inedible.  Quality of food was somewhere south of Buffalo Wild Wings.

Overall, terrible service which seemed more like an honest cluelessness about what services a waitstaff should be providing, mediocre food, poor beer list, but a cool area.  With all of the other options within a couple of miles, if there is not an immediate improvement in service level, quality of food, and beer list i can't see this place lasting."}
{"text":"I came here tonight to join a bunch of friends for a drink and a quick snack. The whiskey selection was fairly good and the food menu pretty much met my expectations for the type of establishment. I ordered an Angel's Envy and their fried portabella mushrooms. The mushrooms were probably the best I've had... the fried batter was not overly greasy, the mushroom inside had a rich flavor, and the aioli dipping sauce was an excellent complement (the honey mustard was alright). Our waitress was very warm and came by frequently. My friends, who ordered wings, complained that they were small, but overall I was satisfied and would go there again."}
{"text":"My husband and his friend had lunch there on 12-31-13...after loading some firewood around 11:30. He had the grilled chicken wrap and fries which he says were both excellent. His friend had Ribeye sandwich with house made chips which he said were fantastic. They didn't have beers, just iced tea and the service was friendly and VERY GOOD. 
My husband is a bit \"frugal\" and he said it was not expensive. They really liked the atmosphere. Couple a guys having lunch had a great time."}
{"text":"The remodeling of this building was done extremely well, and I was extremely impressed when first seeing the interior.  But, the food is terrible, and unfortunately, I doubt I will ever go back. 

The staff is friendly, and I really want them to succeed, but I think the writing is already on the wall.  If they don't fix the food, it's going to fail.

First off, it is more of a restaurant atmosphere than a \"Saloon\", as suggested by their logo.  I went for lunch, and there was quiet music in the background, and everything was spotless.  Don't expect it to be a raucous bar.  I'm not really sure what it will be like inside on game days.

Second, even though the name says \"brew\", this place specializes far more in wine than in beer.  It's not even on the menu!  They had 5-6 domestic beers on tap, but nothing that stands out.

Unfortunately, the real killer here is the food and the prices.  The fries are crinkle-cut frozen fries (unacceptable), and it costs $1.75 to add them on to a burger.  A burger without fries shouldn't be more than $5, but it's $7.50 here, and it's not even that large.  The only good thing to say about the burger is that you can customize it more than almost any other place.  They had probably 6 types of cheese, 6 types of rolls, lots of toppings, and sauces.  Unfortunately, the burger itself was terrible (probably frozen meat).

A friend got a pizza, and the spices and toppings on the pizza were good.  But, I'm pretty sure the pizza dough was precooked a different day, and then just pulled out of the freezer.  It was tough, and mediocre.

I really hope that the owner sees this and fixes the food issues.  If so, I'll be back.  But, as it stands now, this place is doomed to failure.

EDIT 3/13/2014:

I'm updating the review today, since I went back for dinner.

It seems the frozen fries are still there, but the dinner food seems quite good.  I got the thick cut ribeye, rare, and it was genuinely cut thick, priced very well, and extremely tasty.  

My fiancée ordered one of the overpriced burgers plus fries.  The fries were still not good, but for some reason, she wasn't charged for them. The menu says they cost extra ($1.75, I think), but I'm wondering if they just include them for free now.  If they are included, then the burger is not really overpriced.  The burger was much better this time, and the amount of customization allowed is really fantastic.  

The decor is still great, the place is very clean, and we had good service.  Considering all of this, I feel that I should raise my review to at least 3 stars.  I've decided to go to 4, since I feel bad about the earlier negative review."}
{"text":"I went back to Orange & Brew twice in the last week and was pleasantly surprised. First of all, they now carry Angry Orchard cider on tap ($4.25/pint) which was great- still not much variety but I'll take it. The second day they had a special for cheap glasses of house wine which were generous portions! The waiter we had both days was very attentive to us as well as other customers around us. I can't speak to the food, but a friend ordered a meal and was promptly served and she seemed satisfied. There were a bunch of people around watching games on tv so it wasn't as awkwardly empty as the last time we were there but it really is a weird space to begin with. They seem to be listening to some of the feedback people have been giving them."}
{"text":"Horrible! Don't ever order the \"ribeye steak sandwich\" which was basically a burnt skirt steak which taste horrible. And the only thing the waitress had to say was \"yeah I only eat the chicken wrap\" and \"so u want your check!?\"  Umm yes I want my check. And to never come back again. Thanks."}
{"text":"Average. That is the best way to describe the dining at Orange and Brew. Their food selection is OK but not great. The quality is OK but not great. All in all you leave a little underwhelmed. Pizza and wings have been the best of the items I have ordered.

Not a huge beer selection (for a place with \"Brew\" in their name\") as they only have 6 or 8 on tap. The beers they do have are quite good and they have decent week-day specials but it still leaves you wanting more.

Service has been hit or miss. I have had one GREAT server and a handful of not-so-good ones who didn't know the menu.

The best thing Orange and Brew has going for it is its setting. Their space is beautiful with incredible TV placement (and lots of them) to ensure you will always be able to see the game. They have an awesome space that you can rent out with pool tables, a lounge area, and foozball. 

If you are looking for a solid, new place to go to watch a game or have a dinner with friends, Orange and Brew is for you but I would encourage you not to have extravagant expectations."}
{"text":"I would really like to give this place no stars. I have never written any thing like this but the way this restaurant treated the illini fans on 12/31/2013 was absolutely horrible. 

Went there before the Illini Indiana basketball game. Had drove down from Chicago and friends came in from NYC to go. Arrived at Orange and Brew at 12:00 for a 2:00 game. It was busy...but of course they knew this was going to happen on a big ten opener?

We ordered drinks and food right away. We waited over and hour and twenty minutes for our food. About and hour into our wait we mentioned to the waitress that we were trying to get to the game. She abruptly stated \"yeah you and everyone else, there is not much I can do about it.\" WOW....at that point we asked for our check. It took about 20 minutes for her to get the check to us with just the drinks. When she brought it she rudely stated \"Just don't take it out on me, this is the kitchens fault.\" 

The kitchen had stacks and stack of food up at the counter waiting to be brought to tables. The wait staff was standing around in front of these plates not running them to the tables...they were just waiting for their plates...I was a waitress...if you see a plate with food on it and you are busy, you take it to that table...if it is your table or not it doesn't matter. It was obviously not the kitchen's fault. The manager or owner was no where in sight. I would have expected him to be apologizing for the waits and delivering food to take a burden off the confused wait staff. 

I will not be going there again. Its too bad. I had been there once to watch a game and the food was decent (not amazing by any means...the beer selection sucks). There are plenty of other places to go with better prices, better food, better beer and better staff around C-U."}
{"text":"I came here the other night for dinner with my family, after reading the following reviews...mine is going to be completely different.  They must have read the reviews because there was a sign there telling you to \"please seat yourself\" which I don't have a problem with.  As soon as I met my family there, the waiter came and took my drink order, he was very friendly and about everything right.  Not to long after, our orders we're taken which took about 10-15 minutes to come out.  (NOTE this was a Monday night and not very busy). I ordered the fish and chips.  Pretty decent.  The chips are the crunchy homemade style which I would prefer over greasy lays with my 10.00 meal.  My daughter got Mac and cheese which looked like kraft...but 99% of restaurants serve that kind on their kid menu, so that didn't bother me and she was satisfied.  The bar manager did come over and check on us which was nice.  Overall I would say I enjoyed my visit, and would definitely go back again.  I did take into consideration they have only been open for what ...a month ...so they are prolly still finding their nitch, but if they do fix the kinks this place could be a fun place for a game night in."}
{"text":"Nice and spacious! It's also great for watching games as they have a slew of TV's plastered all over the place. The nachos were fantastic and the burgers are just about average. I went during the day when it was empty and was quite surprised at the lackadaisical service. If service is that slow during the day, I can only imagine what it'd be like during the night. My bill came out to $13 for the burger and the nachos."}
{"text":"Good, not great, beer selection.

I've been twice. Once by myself at 2 PM, and once with a group of five. VERY slow. Food was ok (on the first trip). We didn't get food the second time because we were on lunch and it was 45 before she was ready to take our order. I had to get back to work. Hungry me :("}
{"text":"-12 degrees, everythings shutdown...  orange and brew is open!  sounds like its time to try out this new joint that opened at this great location that has seen many a establishment fail...  A wonderful experience, i really hope they're the ones to make this place work and they gave me every indication that they can pull it off.  
     Lunch.  Hot wings and pizza?  yes, that's what i want.  The wings are great, franks hot sauce with a bit of sriracha and a touch of lemon.  perfect.  that's what a hot wing should be in my book, and the put it on top of some sweet patoado fries for good measure.  Pizza.  Whole wheat crust, thin, chewy, real italian pizza dough.  the toppings.  we had sausage (great sausage) green olives and jalapeno.  the olives and peppers you could tell were sliced from whole olives and peppers, not out of a can or jar.  
     Ham havarti panini:  great sandwich topped with a great mustard...  
     Lots of tv's nice bar area and a patio that would have been an option if it wasn't -12 below.  There's plans on opening the upstairs for music and i really hope they pull it off because this is a great building that has such potential and it's a shame if it's not utilized.  (its an old coca cola bottling plant from back in the 30's)
  Update great service from Jessie daytime  bartender. Knowledgeable, friendly and makes a mean Bloody Mary."}
