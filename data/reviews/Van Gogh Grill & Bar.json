{"text":"Really not sure why this place is still in existence. Given the location it could have so much potential, but instead it still serves old style pasta, pizza, and grub, non of which is good. The beer on tap is mediocre at best. Last time I was there they had Traditional on tap by Big Rock. If it's 2000 sure, but it's not. Time to refresh the beer list.   I could see this place being a nice coffee and breakfast place during the early to mid part of the day, and turning into a micro-brew style beer house with fresh ingredient pizzas and healthy meals for the afternoon and dinner hours. Just imagine how popular it could be given its proximity to the hordes of people travelling to and fro from the mountains. It's literally a perfect destination, but instead the owners think it should continue to be an old school and unkept semi-dive establishment. I have no idea how this place is still in business. Maybe it's a money laundering cover.   To the owners: check out Jackson's Corner in Bend, Oregon. Become that and you will be very well known throughout southern Alberta, or perhaps continue to launder your money and stay a lame excuse for a local neighbourhood pub. Up to you, but in the meantime I won't be back and I won't be recommending your restaurant, bar, or whatever you may think it is."}
{"text":"We live near by and have tried Van Goghs a few times. Pita meal is okay..you can get better at Opa though! The waitress suggest I try the chicken burger and the chicken was very chewy/rubber like. I have yet to have very good service here-- very slow. They do have a great Salmon salad though. Everything else has been very mediocre and garlic overload!"}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and they deserve a 4 star but the food is terribly disappointing and the drinks and food take forever to arrive, therefore the overall 2 star.   When this place first opened it was very very good and I came here often since I live in the area. But they've changed hands and the quality just went down the drain since! Their baked spaghetti meatball was nothing but boring and dreadful! If I'm right, nothing is made in house, not the meatballs nor the pasta sauce. It was just a hot plate of boiling cheese with no flavour :( if I spent 10 minutes cooking up a pasta dish it'd taste better than that. It's such a simple dish and so hard to mess up.   Other times that I went to the restaurant I had ordered salads and burgers, which were not as terrible as the pasta dish. The bison burger was pretty good. But the overall quality has just went down significant as nothing is as good as before they changed hands. So I'll double think, triple even, to going there again."}
{"text":"This place serves \"Greek\" food. Nothing terribly authentic, so dont expect that, but a decent enough place. I have only been there for lunch, and it has been good every time. Portions are large, the lunch special prices are really good, and the service is fine enough.  Oh, their calamari is pretty good."}
{"text":"I ordered the lasagna to go, it was a very generous portion in a metal chinese take- out container.  When I got home and added this \"authentic\" dish to the caesar salad it's looks didn't nearly boast enough of it's totally beige tastelessness.  Lasagna is difficult to miss the mark with but somehow it's been done.  Sadly enough I think it's more their fault than what meets the eye as I later that week ordered this same take away dish from bona-roma and got the EXACT identical tasteless boring lazy miserably doorstop of a barely passable food item."}
{"text":"Good local neighborhood bar and grill.  Probably my favorite burger and love their steak fries.  Decent pizza.  Good bar area with big tvs.  Mostly take out for me, but when dine in service is very good."}
{"text":"We were a large group after a day of hiking in the mountains. Portions were large, and we were hungry, so everyone enjoyed their Greek/Italian food. My Calamari Caesar Salad was good - Calamari could have been a touch less greasy, but was still good."}
{"text":"Why is this place still in business? Last time in, the inept server spilled a full glass of beer on our guest, as she tried to place the glass on the table. Another server appeared with a small stack to tiny cocktail napkins to try to mop up the mess. What! No gesture of any like by management to compensate for the mistake. In fact another server was rude to me when I asked to see the manager. Awful awful awful. Have never returned."}
{"text":"From the casual atmosphere, friendly server and great food, this restaurant will now be on our list of go-to places for a family dinner.  We had a cozy table by the fireplace, and our server (Valeria) was friendly, efficient and attentive.  The food was delicious and the portions were generous, and with a diversified menu, it met everyone's tastes.    We had calamari to start, which was very tender and it was a good portion for sharing.  My husband had a greek salad and said the feta cheese was fantastic - soft and moist instead of dry and crumbly.  I had the angel hair pasta with basil chicken, and while there may have been a bit too much sauce, the chicken was tender and the pasta wasn't overcooked.  My husband and son had the special, which was a bacon wrapped filet, served with a shrimp skewer, rice and steamed veggies.  Both said it was delicious, the steak was cooked to their liking, and the shrimp was tender.    I would definitely recommend this to families or a casual dinner out with friends."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Van Gogh's now for several years, as I live in Valley Ridge, and I must say that the food is consistently great.  I have honestly never had a negative experience there.  When I order nachos, I actually get lots of cheese!  The calamari is never rubbery!  The burgers are done fabulously.  What I particularly enjoy is the portion size.  In a day and age where a person can go out to eat and spend a hundred bucks or more on a pretentiously served and plated \"appetizer\" sized entre' it's nice to sit down to a good priced and flavourful meal that leaves you full, and probably having to take home a doggy bag.  This is a great neighborhood restaraunt that I am proud to recommend to my friends.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Dropped by this restaurant after flying in to Calgary for a quick lunch. Hostess/waitress was very friendly. We ordered a steak sandwich (one of the specials), a scallop and shrimp pasta, and chicken fingers.   Steak sandwich: didn't try it personally, but my parents shared this dish and both seemed to be enjoying it. I did try some fries that came along as a side, and they were delightfully crispy and tasty.   Scallop and shrimp pasta: I ordered this dish, and the sauce was plain and a bit bland. They were generous with the scallops and shrimp, however. One big minus about this pasta was the fact that I found a huge pool of oil waiting for me at the bottom. Made me feel a bit queasy about what I had just eaten.   Chicken fingers: my brother ordered this and he loved it. I also took a bite and the chicken tenders were really nicely crispy on the outside without being over-battered.   Portions were big enough that a group of four was able to get full off three entrees. Took longer than expected for the food to get out, especially since we were pretty much the only party there, but overall a decent experience."}
{"text":"The service was awful and the food was cold. The place is run down and needs a good cleaning."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very dark inside, poor lighting made it hard to see the menu or food. Beer selection on tap was poor, they could try adding some local microbrews. The veggie pizza had to be one of the worst I've ever had. Tough dough and congealed cheese, seemed like a frozen pizza heated up. The souvlaki wrap wasn't bad but the chunks of lamb were tough. They would do better serving it with sliced gyro meat.The waitress found it hard to crack a smile. Our bill came to $86 for a very forgettable meal."}
