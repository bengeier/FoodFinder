{"text":"I patronized Celeb's a week ago with some friends and we decided to order different things.  I gave it 4 stars before because I ended up liking my friends meal better than mines. Took my mom to dinner there tonight for a fish fry and I am happy to say I gladly give it 5 stars.  The dinner was fabulous, dessert was as well.  The owner Albert was very engaging with each patron and the wait staff were extremely nice.  Didn't have to wait long to get my drinks or my food.  I definitely will be visiting Celeb's again real soon.  I believe nice they get the word out that they are there that business will be bursting at the seams!!!"}
{"text":"I really liked the relaxed atmosphere and the food.  It was my first time here and the food is pretty great.  It's comfort food but taken to a higher level and superb quality.  I ordered the crab cakes and it was all crab no filler, quite succulent.  This is definitely the place to stop in for lunch and the chef was pretty cool she came out to greet us and made sure we were happy with our experience."}
{"text":"Ordered through foodie call. The delivery service great the food not so great. I expect some things just don't deliver well but this was just bad quality. Ordered baked chicken with stuffing side. The chicken was good but the stuffing was stovetop stuffing from the box! Really you can't make your own stuffing? We also ordered the cheese steak and fries. Meat way to salty and chewy. Also ordered piece of cake of the day which was strawberry. Sooo bad was out of a box very fake strawberry taste, almost a strawberry quik taste. Icing also out of a can. It's supposed to be soul food but this food had NO SOUL,"}
{"text":"The old Presto is now Celebs.....I think it is supposed to be soul food or southern inspired.  The sweet potato biscuits had my eyebrows dancing as I was scanning the menu:-), and they were actually pretty good when served hot. They have daily specials and pretty good selections to choose from.

I sampled the turkey wings with num num sauce(their homemade bbq sauce), cornbread dressing, and black eyed peas.  My son had the chicken and mac n cheese.  He liked the chicken but was not pleased with the mac which is coming from a kid that will eat any type of mac n cheese so it had to be bad for him not to eat it.  It tasted sweet, sugary and cheesy...weird to say the least.  The turkey wings were pretty good but would have been better if there was more sauce on the wings...or if they actually cooked the wings in the sauce but there was very little sauce on them......and the sauce was good so I really would have liked more.  The peas were good and the dressing was just ok.  Not to bad, and will probably return."}
{"text":"I went to Celebs this week during lunch. The positives are the chicken is REALLY good and the entree portion size is huge. I had enough for lunch the next day! The num num sauce was very tasty! I didn't even use the hot sauce I requested. The staff and owner were very friendly and accommodating. I also had mac and cheese and cabbage for sides and they were ok. The mac and cheese was sweet but it wasn't bad. The only negative would be the timing of service. It took quite a bit of time to get our food and even when we requested the bill. I figured it was due to the restaurant being new but for lunch time it was definitely a negative. They have live music daily so I will definitely go back to check that out and try other things on the menu. I can definitely see this becoming a place I frequent often."}
{"text":"Red velvet waffles had too much coco! Tasted like chocolate waffles but the chicken was great! Grits bland and textured like mashed potatoes!"}
{"text":"OK...  This is a LIVE review...  I'll add stuff as I go... 

1. First impression - to be fair I arrived after work in Uptown and it's only 6pm.  I'm the only one here and the place is empty.  Eating alone is awkward enough but to be the sole patron is like a loser in limelight..   LOL. 
Celebs seems very clean and welcoming and I was seated by a lovely young lady (dirty old man cue)...  Got a draft from their limited mass brewery choices but was given a lovely sweet potato biscuit as a welcome gift...  Wow,  it went down smoothly with a tad of honey....  Whoowhee,  that was good. 

2. OK,  I'm perusing the menu...  It's rather eclectic with quite a few heart stopping choices in the fried chicken and fatty beef genres.  Yet,  there seems to be some real healthy gems in between the adipose tissue.
 
3. I ordered the Cereal Encrusted fried chicken with visions of Fred Sanford grasping his chest...  I also ordered greens with smoke turkey and yams...  Yeah,  we're talkin' Southern,  y'all. Damn, that's some tasty chicken... I added some (a lot) of Texas Pete and we're talking fried-chicken heart attack... but I'd die with a smile on my face. 

4. Service was excellent but it's hard not to serve well when the place is empty... for those of you b!tching about service on game day, well, all I have to say is Duh! Really! All I can say is eat here on away games and you'll love it!"}
{"text":"The chef and staff have changed. Had a great shrimp salad. 

Check out the new menu.

Parking is next door and ample."}
{"text":"Old dry food is not what I call good at all. Management sucks and just an overall bad experience. The best thing about this place are the bathrooms sinks."}
{"text":"Well... We were excited to have Celebs tonight and it was not a good decision. The chicken and waffles were dry and tasteless and the spinach and artichoke dip seemed like it was a completely different recipe. Not sure what's happened but this might be our last meal from Celebs. Such a disappoint :("}
{"text":"Was in town for the convention and found this AMAZING place! Food is high quality and cooked perfectly. Staff was more than accommodating and friendly. Don't miss this place if you're in town!"}
{"text":"Hit and miss for me. Been there twice on weeknights.

Pretty empty both times. The first time, the grits and salmon were great. The biscuits were nice and the desserts were just OK.

Second time, the grits were a big miss (really soupy) and the salmon tasted old. The cereal-crusted chicken was OK. But both the biscuits and desserts were better than before. 

I will add my house salad was tasty and thoughtfully put together (if that even makes sense) - so there is some talent in the kitchen.

Seem like decent people run this joint. I hope they make it. The Southern Chic menu is interesting. But it will probably not be on my hot list."}
