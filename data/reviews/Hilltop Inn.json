{"text":"Great fish. Old school supper club. Nice old school bar. They have a decent children's menu"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Madison area Fish Fry.  I love being out in Western Dane County...the people are great.  Fish fry there is excellent.  Lots of options, but I frequent the cod.  Generous portions, and great prices.  Wait staff is excellent, and very friendly.  Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Great food and homey atmosphere. Never felt so welcomed by another restaurant. 

Owner's son was very accommodating and even gave us great directions home.

As someone from a big city, I'm happy to have found this quiet enclave where you are treated like family. 

Will definitely be back for more fried fish!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our first visit to Hilltop Inn. We went based on previous Yelp reviews. For a truly authentic Wisconsin fish fry experience, this place was fantastic. I loved the perch, & my husband also enjoyed the cod. Good local beers on tap (both had Capitol's Mai Bock.) Friendly conversations with locals, & smiling staff. We recommend (if you like the good ol' tavern/super club experience.)"}
{"text":"Not for Sunday brunch (unless you feel the need to do penance)

We've been here previously for Friday fish fry. My recall is that it was okay. However, this review has to do with its Sunday brunch that we experienced today. Whoa, not good friends. It consisted of a small unattended serving line that had coleslaw, some sort of pasta salad, Bisquick-type biscuits, a pan with chicken pot pie looking slurry (probably to spoon over the biscuits), chicken thighs, some sort of beef or pork ribs, fried potatoes, toast, bacon, sausage links and scrambled eggs. An adjacent table had dishes with deserts, mostly small pieces of cake. The server also said we could have French toast specially made for us.

My spouse and I had some combination of French toast, eggs, potatoes, sausage links, coleslaw and biscuits. All of the items that should be served hot, including the made to order French toast, were lukewarm at best. Sadly, this mediocre brunch with coffee cost $26.90. I recommend you brunch-up elsewhere.

{"text":"Friday Fish Fry - I had the baked cod with hash-browns.  The meal started with a seasonal tap beer and a loaf of fresh bread.  I like to cut the bread nice and thick then spread on the butter.  When the fish arrived, it was hot and presented well.  The baked cod had great flavor.  The hash-browns were quite salty.  They tasted OK, but next time I would order the baked potato.  The coleslaw was very tasty."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while and we came in on a Friday night for the fish fry. It's their busiest night...especially in the fall. They only have one grumpy bartender that works Friday night so getting a drink takes about a half an hour. They need another bartender or two to handle the crowd. The food takes a long time too so be sure to get the \"salad bar\". This is your usual WI supper club."}
{"text":"My fiancee' and I are on the search for the best Friday fish fry in the Dane County area and on the recommendation of friends, decided to check out Hilltop Inn.

They had a nice selection of fish options and I was very pleased to see they had walleye on the menu.  The atmosphere is very typical Wisconsin Supper Club.  Though we could have been seated right away, we were waiting on friends and chose to get a drink at the bar.  They have a limited but tasty selection of beers on tap and their old fashions are primo.  The even had an old Pac Man game in the bar to authenticate that feeling of nostalgia. 

I had the beer battered walleye and hash browns with cheese and onions.  My fiancee' had the beer battered perch with a 'fully loaded' baked potato.  Both fish dinners were excellent.  The batter wasn't too much or too little and the fish was fresh.  Very tasty.  Both potato sides were very boring.  The hash browns were more soggy than crisp and the fully loaded baked potato consisted of butter and that's it.  Nothing too special.  The special dessert was coconut cream pie and though I'm not a huge coconut fan, I gave it a try and it was fabulous.

The service was great and we all had a great experience overall.  Verdict: recommend for the fish and good old Supper Club atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I used to work in Cross Plains and would drive past this place. I did that for about a year before I finally said \"I have to try it.\" A friend of mine had ate there a week prior and like the fish. He and I both enjoy fish fries. Anyways I decided that tonight was the night I would head to Pine Bluff for some fine dining. I called in the early afternoon and made a reservation for 2 at 5:30 for my fiancee and I. We arrived at about 5 for a beverage in the bar before we ate. The bartender was friendly and looked like Santa Clause with his snow white hair and beard. 

Fast forward to 5:30 and we head over to the hostess station and the host seats us promptly. We look over the menu's for a few minutes and our waiter stops by to take drink orders. (Brandy Old Fashioned's are good here)... We both hit up the salad bar which was small but pretty good. 

A few minutes later we had fresh fish, both enjoying cod (deep fried). It was a tad small as I only ordered the 1/2 order which consisted of 2 pieces since I had a salad. The pieces were kind of small. I had french fries with the fish and they were crispy and fresh. The fish was served with tartar sauce and no lemons. 

Overall the fish was ok, I would have liked a bit more breading on it. The salad bar needs to be expanded. Our waiter never stopped by to ask how our meal was, he just kept walking past and I when I flagged him down for  our check he seemed embarrassed almost like he forget about us... 

If i had a different waiter next time I think I'd be happier, the menu looks good although limited. I think I will try the Lake Perch next time or a steak The atmosphere was your typical old school Sconnie Supper Club which is becoming more and more rare.


Well folks, I may be back..."}
