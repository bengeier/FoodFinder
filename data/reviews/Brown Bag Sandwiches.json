{"text":"This is what a sandwich place is meant to be. Everything I've tried is great. The guys working here care about what they're making and they make it good. It's that simple. Will be back. Again. And again. And again."}
{"text":"Shockingly good given location and student clientele. These are adult sandwiches. Staff gives a damn about their work. Ryerson students have no idea what they have next door. You'll leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Amazing fries with some super tasty home made ketchup! The sandwiches are amazing and had many options for toppings. They have a great student deal."}
{"text":"In ranked order of the sandwiches I have tried:

1. Fried Chicken
2. Brisket
3. Pork Belly
4. Hot Roast Beef
5. Cold Turkey

They are all good, but the fried chicken is really, truly delicious. The other sandwiches are good as well, but they have many homemade sauces that they use to top the sandwiches, and sometimes I think the sauce runs away with it and the sandwiches end up being one note. Nevertheless, they are really well made sandwiches, the staff is cool in a conscientious-yet-cool way, and I have always enjoyed everything I have gotten there. 

Highly recommended over other popular sandwich chains rhyming with Clubway, Pita Snit or Mr. Bub.

Next to try: the fries."}
{"text":"Excellent neighborhood joint for hot or cold sandwiches.  

I go here for the fried chicken sandwich.  Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside breaded fried chicken with creamy guacamole and chipotle aioli.  This baby is perfect for lunch and a good late afternoon 'snack.'  Warning:  this item sold out often.

Zero ambiance, but who needs it when they have a rad jukebox playing classic, old school tunes.

Staff is always friendly and super nice!"}
{"text":"I haven't had a sandwich there I didn't like!  My faves are the fried chicken and pork belly.   Get the fries and then wash it down with a glass bottle of ice cold coke! Stuff is made from scratch.  Making your own ketchup?  Now that's dedication to the game! I could probably eat a few sandwiches.  But for regular people, one is enough.  Be warned though, you might get sleepy after lunch.  My stamp card is full. Next sandwich is free! Sandwiches that keep on giving!"}
{"text":"The fanciest sandwich ever packed in a brown paper bag.

Move over roast beef, turkey, and tuna, Brown Bag Sandwiches has some less traditional but awesome sandwich options.

I had a hard time deciding between the duck confit, pork belly, and fried chicken.

The duck sandwich seemed like peking duck in the form of a sandwich.
Duck, cabbage, and hoisin sauce.

The chicken schnitzel sounded fantastic, but I wanted something different to warm myself up.

I went with the pork belly, with charred tomato slaw, and their home made mustard. 

I chose the smaller size sandwich on a whole wheat bun ($7.50).
While they made my sandwich, I ran next door to get a latte from Bulldog Coffee.  I came back and they were assembling my sandwich.  I took a look at their potato salad and sort of wish I ordered a side.  They have fries, soup, but the potato salad was hard to resist.

The sandwich itself was a good size.
I found the bun was nice and crispy, but I like less bread and more stuff.
The pork belly was seared and smelled great.  However, I wish it was made a bit crispier, because it was more like eating lukewarm chunks of fat with tomato.  The mustard is mostly a layer of mustard seeds, but it didn't have a lot of bite.

It was a good sandwich.  I don't think I'll order the pork belly again, but I'll definitely be back to try something else."}
{"text":"Best option in the area for a quick cheap lunch if you're into sandwiches. I like the brisket and the chicken. The fries are the real show stoppers, though. They freshly fry and season each order. Crispy on the outside, creamy real potato goodness on the inside...house made ketchup and chipotle mayo on the side...drool."}
{"text":"This place is pretty friggen awesome! I've been here twice, and the $10 student combo (sandwich + side dish + drink) is perfect for broke kids like me! =D. 

I've only tried two sandwiches so far, but both were yummy! The beef brisket was packed with meat. I LOVE the side dishes. There isn't just the boring french fries and salad. There's a whole bunch more -- including an amazing bean salad and homemade chips! Yum! 

I feel like I'd be a regular here if I lived closer because the food quality really is amazing and fresh for a sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Had the roast beef sandwich, delicious and fresh! Freshly made guacamole and vegetable toppings was a delight. Good value and the two workers there were friendly and had a big smile on their face"}
{"text":"Randomly came across this restaurant after my workout at the Ryerson gym. The guys that work there are really chill folks!!! 

I would definitely recommend getting the pulled pork sandwich or the fried chicken sandwich.

I would also recommend getting to-go there as the place is too tiny to sit down and eat."}
{"text":"I want, no not want, NEED to get a Brown Bag Sandwiches T-shirt if such a thing exists.  If it doesn't I'll have to pitch them on the idea.  I can safely say that my affinity for T-shirts for places, people or things that I like has been somewhat of an obsession over the years, but I save this compulsion for only the decidedly deserved and BBS is more than deserving.  

This is a place that you immediately feel at home in., No one will judge you if the guac or chipotle aioli from the delectable Fried Chicken Sandwich slides down your chin, because chances are the person sitting across from you suffers from a similar affliction.  The sandwiches are so good here that you will literally drool as they are being created before your very eyes.  

The fried chicken and guac sandwich is a killer combo.  The chicken is tender and moist and the guac has a zippy kick which is complimented perfectly by pairing it with the crispy house made chips.  And is even better when washed down with Coke in a bottle.  YES COKE IN A BOTTLE!!  They do most things on site here, including homemade ketchup and smoked bacon.  And they are not afraid to experiment with things that may not be typically associated with standard sandwich fare, such as  house cured pork belly with charred tomato relish and salmon with maple syrup sandwhiches.  And although I have yet to try these two, know that I will, and you dear Yelpers should too.

So if you happen to see a man strolling somewhere in the Annex, or just loitering outside BBS donning a tee with a familiar brown bag emblazoned across the front, chances are I was successful in my pitch.  This is a shirt I will inevitably wear with pride and hope that they consider me on any subsequent merchandising kick backs.  I won't take any form of monetary compensation though,  I will only accept payment in snadwhich form."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I was wondering around on Canada day on church street when this store caught my interest gfrom the corner of my eye. the sign seemed interesting. I wonandered in, with some friends in tow and saw a number of different sandwhiches listed on the chalk boards. The helpful server took my order and answered a few questions I had , within a short time I had a Pulled Pork Sandwhich with bbq , mayo and Coleslaw. I have to say it was FABULOUS!! I loved it, it was delicious. I would totally go back to this store and have more from them if I was closeby. I LOVED IT !!"}
{"text":"Visited here again for the 2nd time.  Last time I had some type of meat sandwich and I don't remember what it was.  However, as part of my new diet, I try to avoid meat unless its a weekend or special occasion.  Anyways, I ordered a hot veggie sandwich and it was absolutely delicious.  It's basically grilled veggies (eggplant, cheese, mushrooms, spinach, onions, mushrooms and some other things) on a lovely soft bun.  It felt like I was eating BBQ veggies and I absolutely LOVE those.  

I also ordered a side of fries and they were perfectly salted.  

Conclusion:  I'm gonna differ from the norm here, but I think the hot veggie sandwich is the way to go as opposed to the meat sandwiches."}
{"text":"Another brilliant Yelp find. I stopped into Brown Bag yesterday for a late lunch/early dinner. Despite seeing some enticing menu options, I picked the fried chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries.

Every single bite of that enormous sandwich was fantastic. Best part: for only $12 I got the sandwich, fries and a Diet Coke. Definitely stop in Brown Bag!"}
{"text":"CLOSED! Appears there was issue with landlord/location.. Maybe we need room for the millionth condo..."}
{"text":"When I entered the store, it was packed which is a good sign. The guy behind the counter was friendly and helped my friend and I place our orders even if it was busy at lunchtime. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side salad and a bottle of water. I felt that it was just right for $10. (It's $12 if you're not a student.)

The pulled pork was good; it was not dry, but was tender and juicy. I can't really say how good it is compared to other pulled pork sandwiches because I haven't had a lot. The bun wasn't too big that it couldn't fit in my mouth (hello, Subway!). Neither was it too tough that I had to chew it apart. Love the bun! The salad was fresh and I loved how the balsamic vinaigrette was like something I could make at home.

I loved the chill vibe Brown Bag exudes. I love the chalkboards, wooden furniture and the ye old jukebox cranking out tunes in the corner.  Being a big fan of well-made slow-cooked food, I think that the best thing about this place is that they make everything from scratch (except the cheese)!

 I will definitely come back soon to try the Fried Chicken Sandwich, the Pork Belly sandwich and the fries!

Con: Limited seating available in-store. Should probably opt for take-out most of the time."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the Chicken Salad Sandwich. I don't think I've ordered another type of sandwich after trying this.

Add: lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, cukes, and grainy dijon. 

I'm upgrading my 3.5 stars to 4 stars. Good work, BBS."}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken sandwich TWICE and it was delicious!

The fried chicken was crispy and the meat inside wasn't dry.  The guacamole and chipotle aioli go very well with the chicken.

The staff is friendly and easygoing.  Sandwiches are made to order and service is pretty quick.

Can't wait to come back to try the other stuff on the menu!  ;)"}
{"text":"Stop wasting your time eating garbage sandwiches and go eat awesome sandwiches here. The staff give a shit about the food they make and it shows in what they have chosen to put on the menu and in the taste of the finished sandwiches they serve. Additionally, my partner is a french fry aficionado and she claims Brown Bags fries (and in house ketchup) are the best in Toronto. She is serious business about potatoes, so I take her word for it... they're pretty amazing fries.

The food is great, the staff is always awesome and the prices are low for the quality of ingredients and the amount of attention put into the food.

Eat here."}
{"text":"I echo Brian K's 3.5 stars.

I had the cold turkey sandwich, with onions and cranberry jam and it was really good. I found it slightly too expensive; the combo option lets you add a side and a drink for $3.5 extra (the sides are $3 individually). If I had made it a combo it would have been over $10 which I guess is okay, but... I want it to be under $10.

I also didn't really like the bun. If they had amazing bread here, they could put their amazing toppings in it and I would love this place. 

I will definitely eat here again.

I just... wanted it to be amazing, and it was only good."}
