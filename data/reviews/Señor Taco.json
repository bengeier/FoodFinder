{"text":"Not a bad place.  Not a great place.  The price awards this a 4 star because it IS a really great value.  Churros and quesadillas were pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Love this place for basic mex.   Burritos, Quesadillas and consistently good Horchata.  They also do very good Breakfast burritos"}
{"text":"Rolled tacos = divine experience. So much bang for the buck too. Ashamed to be completely stuffed for $5 and their salsa is excellent."}
{"text":"The food has always been good, but not the cleanest taco shop we've been to.  You're taking a gamble when you order any fish, but you will anywhere that serves seafood in Arizona."}
{"text":"NO way, poor service and food was not worth how I was treated. I wouldn't recommend them to any one, it you want service like that just go to taco bell"}
{"text":"I just moved here from cali and was in need of taco Tuesday. Great pricing, great portion sizes, and excellent taste. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Seriously great must try finally i get to eat great fresh mexican food! This place is nothing like one of those Berto chains, Had the hashbrown burrito and rolled tacos and totally tasted like nothing else i have ever had in AZ! Friendly staff and real clean place!"}
{"text":"Better than Filibertos. Our favorite Mexican burrito joint. We usually get the rolled tacos and carne asada burrito and split them."}
{"text":"Let me tell you what's good about Señor Taco:

1)  The food is pretty good and cheap.  
2)  Tacos are better than most higher priced Mexican restaurant tacos.  

Now let me tell what's not good: 

1)  If you order food and eat in, they give you chips.  If you take your food out, you are punished severely.  No chips for you.  Unless you want to pay $2 for chips, then you can have some.  
2)  Salsa is free for everyone.  You can slurp as much salsa as you heart desires however you must pour a tiny amount of that salsa in a tiny little cup.  You can make yourself 100 of these if you want, just make sure you have the time.  Also there is about a 3% chance your chip will fit into the container.   And if you want a large salsa...you must pay $1.  So technically there is an up-charge for your laziness.
3)  There is absolutely zero protein flexibility.  For example, if you would like a hard-shell carnitas taco, you will get a hand to the face.  It is apparently either extremely difficult for them to scoop the carnitas into the hard shell like they do for the shredded beef or they are just hardcore Taco Nazis.  Not even if you offer to pay extra will your wish be granted.  

Look, it's always easy to complain about what's bad vs. what's good.  The \"not good\" section is perhaps a suggestion panel for the owners/managers.  The only real complaint I have is that the people that work there are rude.  There is zero friendliness going on here, and that is the lifeblood of any restaurant.  Step it up Señor Taco."}
{"text":"I came for a big-ass burrito and I left with a huge-ass burrito.
It was yummy, would eat again.
Too far from my house though :("}
{"text":"Better than the chain restaurants. Friendly, clean and well priced. My kids love this place as well."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously delicious. I've had many of their menu items and have never been disappointed.  
The drive thru is a bit long when crowded, but that's because they're made to order.
It's a real restaurant menu with a drive thru so it's not like Taco Bell, it's worth the wait.
Horchata-AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was good. Until I went 35 minutes before they close last Sunday. The cook got a dirty look on his face and didn't even bother to tell the girl we were there waiting. Then she saw us and got an attitude about how they close in half hour. Our food came our cold and tasted  like crap. My shrimp was cold. We both got sick the next day. Karma pays back in folds because after us many people came in. My best thought on a food establishment is how they act when it's getting close to closing time. And you guys failed miserably. I wanted to call the manager Monday, instead you just lost my business. I'll just go somewhere else 2-3 times a week."}
{"text":"I was craving a breakfast burrito and yelped a place close by ... That's how I found Señor Taco. 

The burrito was okay.... 

What did I get? 
The chipotle crunchy burrito... It had egg, bacon, tortilla chips, and chipotle sauce with cheese. 

Cost?
$7 - Yikes! Kinda pricey for a breakfast burrito"}
{"text":"Love this place. Breakfast burrito is very large and tasty. The crunchy burrito has good flavor. For dinner I love the Chipotle chicken burrito."}
{"text":"Great tacos here.  Today I mixed it up and had a bean and cheese burrito.  My hubby ordered the huge nachos."}
{"text":"Tried this place today got the carne asada burrito usually a safe bet it was really good added rice and beans too. First off the burrito was huge adding the rice and beans  I was stuffed I was kinda upset that the combo didn't come with a drink, but all in all it was good and fast."}
{"text":"it is what is it...

food for 2 under $15 - this is the new America.... sloppy food, served fast and without presentation! we should be so proud!!!

Actually, who cares about service. you have someone pressing buttons on a computer screen sending the order to the kitchen. If you build a better interface, the screen could be turned around, take only credit card and completely eliminate the server - in reality the server was eliminated long ago and now most are more interested in texting than caring for your food.

good food
cheap food

average at best. we had burritos and tacos. nothing spectacular, nothing horrible - best way to describe this place is awesome value - lots of food at a low price.

if you want Mexican food, and have only a few bills in your pocket - go to Senor Taco. Cheaper than Chipolte and better than Fredrico's (well eating off my kitchen floor is better than fredrico's lol) not quite a habeneros..

decent Mexican food in the north scottdale FLW/101 corridor

I will be back for a quick fill 

menu is fine print and lots of choices so be prepared to be overwhelmed."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today with a couple of friends before heading to Payson. The food was incredible. The shrimp quesadilla along with the California surfin burrito was amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I don't like guac but I love there's. There rolled tacos are amazing and the horchata is super tasty. I always switch it up and get something different and I never disappointed! :)"}
{"text":"We tried this place because we couldn't even get seated at Garcia's next door.  And they weren't busy.  What a surprise.  It's a upscale Filibertos with much better food. The Chili Verde is amazing and the help is friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and always a smiling face behind the counter. The California Carne Asada is my favorite but everything I've eaten has be great!"}
{"text":"As god made man and woman, he also made delicious Mexican restaurants. The truly glorious as rare as finding the end of a rainbow.... Behold friends, the end of the rainbow!

The California Burrito is made of pixie dust, love, and unicorn meat. This burrito is so good it is haunted by the spirit of Johnny Cash.... Yeah, that good. Do it, do it....... Do it"}
{"text":"My fav here is the Carnitas Burrito, My only complaint would be that one of the cashiers is really moody. She can be nice one day and very aloof  the next. 
Anyhow, I find the food to be tasty and you won't go away hungry if you order the Carnitas Burrito. 
They also have a nice albeit compact salsa bar next to the drink machines. That area is a bit of a problem when the lunch crowd hits because you're bumping and shimmying with people trying to get their drinks and salsa.

The place is bigger than the photo shows."}
{"text":"Sticky tables, full trash cans, and my order is wrong nearly every time. However, when it is right, great portions at a fair price. The rest of my family is always really happy with it, and I seem to be the only one who gets their order messed up- it could be my fault! People are really nice, and the best part is those cinnamon chips!"}
{"text":"We love Senior Taco. It's our favorite Mexican restaurant. Great portions, low prices, delicious food.\""}
{"text":"Just darn GOOD!!!  I have had breakfast, lunch and dinner from this \"fast food\" restaurant.  Too many items to list.  You have just got to try it yourself!  their salsas are really good and they also have fresh roasted hot peppers on their salsa bar, oh so good!   The next visit I will update with photos."}
{"text":"We have been there a few times and the food and service is very much hit and miss.  My family and I prefer Ramiro's because the food is much better as is the service.  Hope this helps."}
{"text":"Awsome tacos man I think the best that I have tasted in AZ so far. Will definitely go back. thanks"}
{"text":"So good! Had the \"original\" shrimp burrito and it exceeded all my expectations. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"At this price point, there is no better Mexican food in the east valley. Generous portions, very friendly staff, very clean establishment, and incredibly tasty food. Anything on the menu is fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great prices.  Definately need to get the carnitas torta."}
{"text":"Wow amazing food. Every time I come here I am so happy. Brought a buddy here and he said it was one of the best burritos he has ever had.  The portions are huge and the staff is always really nice. Try the huevos rancheros."}
{"text":"Came with an open mind and left with a full stomach. Prices high for what you get, Beans are canned and since I ordered a #4 Combo I got them on a Tostado and as a side, it was a let down.  Taco was fair, shell crispy but the filling was lacking. I am used to getting tacos full of shredded  beef but this was a small patch in the center with a large glob of cheese, sort of melted. I was greeted and my order taken promptly by a friendly attendant. This is a Sun City establishment. Small salsa bar with no chips and no napkins, only what are given with your order. I got there just in time for the 5 PM specials and an empty parking lot. AT 5 it began to fill up. While in line it was \"specials all around with water for a beverage.\"

The food was wholesome and served in a timely manner and the price for the special was reasonable and the portion more than I could eat.  But I was never the less disappointed. 

Many better places to choose from, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I don't see what the fuss is about. My tacos were bland. The carne asada was tough and too well done. Their pico is huge pieces of onion, green pepper, and tomato so it's more like having veggies on top of your taco instead of pico. They should chop it up better. I ordered the combo meal with 2 carne asada soft tacos, rice, and beans. The rice was just okay. Beans were good but hard to mess up those. I won't be back. Filibertos is better in my opinion."}
{"text":"OMG place was amazing. I got the surf and turf burrito and it was more than you pay for. It felt like a brick picking it up and it also tasted amazing. I was stuffed but couldn't put it down. Great service, friendly staff and great prices."}
{"text":"This was a good find, good food, great prices and friendly people.i would recommend it to everyone. Small plain little place but worth the stop to try it.The ingredients were fresh and tasty and plenty of food for the money.They have specials after five which are the first five dinners on their menu for $5.00"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was TERRIBLE.  I waited 27 minutes in the drive thru to get my meal.  I ordered the señor combo without any special requests.  That's it.  The cashier never mentioned an apology for the wait.  I will not go back"}
{"text":"Good veggie options on Fridays for Lent; fish tacos and cheese enchiladas are great but the chilaquiles are awesome! Make sure to order them with 2 over easy eggs on top for the full effect!"}
{"text":"It's cheap and reasonably fresh for fast food, but we are in Arizona; there are so many good authentic Mexican alternatives that I'd rather frequent.  I suppose worth a very quick lunch stop if in a real rush."}
{"text":"Every single item I've tasted here is delicious and the service is genuinely kind."}
{"text":"I first heard of this place and someone raved about their burritos. I, of course, living in Arizona and having a burrito shop on every corner didn't think much of it. Then I tried it. Nothing I've ever had here has failed me. I especially enjoy anything with shrimp like their shrimp tacos, shrimp enchiladas, or the diablo shrimp burrito. Their burritos are large, everything is of stellar quality, fresh tasting, and delicious. Their salsa bar is amazing. I'm a huge fan of this place and even though I've moved across town, I still come back. Their service leaves a lot to be desired (as with many places is the case), but it's not enough to keep me away. I highly recommend! And it's right next door to a great Thai place, too!"}
{"text":"We needed a quality Mexican restaurant and it's finally here. The Diablo shrimp was to die for. Great fried fish tacos. Salsa with both flavor and heat. Welcome senior ... We have been waiting for you!"}
{"text":"This place is light years beyond Los Faves. Everything here is fresh. The pork carnitas are killer!!! Love the chilaquiles!! This is the most authentic Mex in S. Chandler, sorry Casa Blanca!"}
{"text":"Have never been disappointed.  Awesome food.  Awesome price.  If you love Mexican food...this is the place.

Spoke too soon. The rice in my burro was cold and the flan I ordered was not package correctly for take out."}
{"text":"I saw the last mexican restaurent go under at this location because they were selling illegal drugs in addition to the lousy food. Im really contemplating the same with these owners. My little Italian grandmother often said: soap and water is cheap. So why do so many taco shops have so much difficulty with cleanliness?  Its simply because they dont care. So being a rational 50 year old man, if the bathroom is dirty is the the kitchen clean? You fill in the blanks. 

Food is way over priced for what you get. I have been around in the food industry and mexican is the least expensive. Taste is so so. The staff is not so friendly. The list goes on. If I want to visit a dirty over priced taco shop with mediocre food with crappy service ,I can go to Tijuana and it least get it cheaper. Sorry owners, go to a corporate restaurant business and copy there business model and you will have more people than you can serve.

Adios Senior Taco..........."}
{"text":"Wow !

We had 'baked' at Nascar all afternoon and were on our way to the East Valley - in 'snail' traffic when the teenagers said they were hungry.

The restaurant was in a tiny mall with a Subway and a pizza place.  We chose Senior Taco

I ordered the special of 5 rolled tacos/drink and was really impressed with the moist chicken in the crunchy tacos and so much guacamole (no extra charge !) really fresh lettuce and grated cheese.

Another Nascar 'nut' had a chicken burrito and it was stuffed with meat, another had a combo plate that looked really good, and the boys had tacos.  They managed to find samples of cinnamon topped chips that had them trotting back and forth while our food was being prepared.

We had taken a chance on this little place and were very happy to be eating great fresh food while we watched the slow traffic pass by !

The bathroom was very clean and smelled great - very nice after a day at PIR !

We'll be back in November and encourage other race fans to join us in their 'fan apparel' :)"}
{"text":"One of the best small Mexican joints around. It's very small inside but I've never seen it crowded. Most people seem to use the drive through. They do seem to take a while if you order using the drive through. Staff is polite and friendly and it's always clean inside. Food is always made as you order it and always taste good! If you're looking for quick authentic Mexican food this is your spot! Beats all other similar joints hands down."}
{"text":"Please, do not fail to read the caveat in the second paragraph of this review.  Senor Taco is one of the best places in Mesa, AZ for Mexican Food.  My husband and I moved to Mesa in 2010, and we've been on the hunt for excellent Mexican cuisine since we arrived.  About six months ago, we read Yelp reviews and decided to give Senor Taco a try.  It is GREAT.

However, as the old saying goes \"I'd rather have hamburger well served than a steak in the face.\"  Despite the good food, Senor Taco's service leaves much to be desired.  My order has never once been correct.  So on Friday, August 8, 2014, at 10:30 a.m., I ordered a breakfast burrito and **politely** mentioned my preference, citing my previous orders had been incorrect.  I received a not only a snarky retort, but it was delivered with a dismissive wave of the hand by the young man taking orders at the counter and the drive-through.  No amount of good food is worth disrespectful treatment; as if the customer is a burden to endure rather than someone to pleasantly attend.

We will certainly go back to Senor Taco, but I can unequivocally say that if the same young man is at the counter, I'll go next door to Lucky Lou's or The Thai Patio."}
{"text":"Horrible. Burrito rice & beans, couldn't even eat half. The pork was dry and chewy with terrible flavor and their salsa tastes like ketchup. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly, and the food here is amazing!!!  Fast, and better than sit down Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"I HATE giving Senor Taco a bad review. They have DELICIOUS food. I'm giving an extra star because of the food. The reason for two stars is that they rarely open on time. They say their hours open at 7am on Saturdays but this is the second week I was there at 7:20 or later and they still weren't open. I had to leave the last two weeks and find another place to eat. I understand the occasional 5 minute late opening but this is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Excellent tortas and breakfast burritos!  The chile verde burrito is pretty tasty too!"}
{"text":"I will not be back to this location. The Carne Asada burrito was filled with fatty meat that I couldn't finish. For a 9 dollars I'll find somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Loved it, fish taco excellent, shrimp burrito LOADED!!! will be back"}
{"text":"In an area surrounded by truly terrible Mexican food, this place is magnificent.  I've been coming here for about a month and haven't had one bad thing off the menu.  It's inexpensive, the owner is nice, and the food is great.  Quick Mexican is not supposed to taste like Filibertos, it tastes like this.  Come here, you will be happy."}
{"text":"So bummed! You know when you're starving either everythinng taste great or you dont really taste it at all because you ate it so fast. Well We were both starving and I give it a 2.  The only good things here were the tortillas and a plus for serving coca cola product. Plates were full and cheap prices but still not worth the $11.00 for us.  Shredded beef burrito was runny and full of super sweet tomato sauce! I asked ahead of time if the beans were homemade the cashier said yes. Maybe they are but I ddn't have to taste twice to know they're fresh out of a can w/o being doctored up"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, delicious.  

I'm so glad Senor Taco is close by me because this place is tasty! 
I almost always have leftovers because the portions are huge for the price you pay.  

Some fast mexican food restaurants make you feel gross after eating there but Senor Taco has never made me regret eating their food.  

Much better than any competitor!"}
{"text":"I went here recently and the service was ok. The food is cheap and if you upgrade to a meal it's a really good deal The food tasted ok nothing great. I got the carne asada and it was cold and tasted ok. The meat was oddly crunchy. The night after eating here for dinner I got sick to my stomach. Would not come back!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!!!! I was highly impressed with the food and service that I received here today!

Let me tell you, I live right across the street from this Señor Taco and I was also more than hesitant to try their food due to my experience with the restaurant that was in the location before.

After passing by it everyday for the last month or so, and with my mom's reassurance that it has since been cleaned, remodeled and is now under new ownership, I gathered my courage and stopped in for a bite to eat. Like I said before, I was more than impressed!!!

I ordered the Chile Relleno Burrito and it was the most delicious Chile Relleno Burrito that I've ever had. I also got a side of both the red sauce and the green sauce and although they both had great flavors, the green was just amazing!

I enjoyed my experience here so much that I even gave them a phone call to commend them for their great work. I'm so happy to know that there is a delicious and safe place to eat right next to my place. I will be returning, and I recommend that you try it out too!"}
{"text":"This place has some awesome food. Absolutely love it. Will definitely be back. Prices are great and the food is awesome."}
{"text":"Great place!  Clean and fast and always fresh.  Lot of food.  Best Mexican food place for fast fresh Mexican food.  Love their shrimp burro and hard shell tacos."}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday! The food is delicious and very inexpensive!"}
{"text":"This place is a find.  A gem tucked away in a strip mall in NE Mesa.  If you are in the mood for some good mexican food at good prices, come on down.  My husband and I each had different burritos and both were excellent, with great salsas too.  The flour tortillas were so fresh and like someone else mentioned, the food wasn't greasy.  This is quality food in a very casual atmosphere.  If you are in a hurry, I noticed that they have drive through too.  Definitely worth a try, especially if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Has a fast food atmosphere and moderate prices but has the best tasting authentic Mexican. As good as any sit down high end restaurant. Fresh hot homemade tortillas, great rice. Try the Carnita it a platter, fantastic!"}
{"text":"Wow. Moved here from San Diego and have been looking for a good taco shop since. FOUND IT. HUGE burritos. Fresh tasting food and its CLEAN! Great salsa bar with carrots, grilled peppers and hot to mild salsas friendly staff and taco shop prices. Love this place. Definitely worth a try.I recommend the surf n turf burrito."}
{"text":"The shrimp cocktail here is very good,  only issue I have ever had was with the Uber driver who brought the food and forgot some of it in his car. 

The tacos here are pretty good size and we're very good."}
{"text":"This place definitely deserves the 5 stars. When I write a review, I take everything into honest consideration. Starting with the customer service, everyone is super friendly. I'm a very picky eater and don't trust many places but I knew right away this was a good place to eat when I saw how clean everything was, the salsa bar, the counters, soda machines, everything! That gave me a huge relief and built my trust immediately. They have a huge menu to chose from, the food is delicious and very affordable!! . I've liked everything I've tried so far and particularly LOVE their California surfing Burrito it is amazinggg! Unlike many other fast food places that may serve the food cold, the multiple times that I've visited Senor Taco my food has always been really warm and that's something I always look out for. This location has only been open for about a month and every time I go eat there, there are always lots of customers which that alone speaks for itself. I am a very satisfied, this place not only met but EXCEEDED my expectations and I definitely recommend anyone to eat here, you won't regret it. Two thumbs up!! :)"}
{"text":"OK so the food is delicious! Came here Saturday morning with the family. I didn't order anything cuz I had already ate at the house but when dad insisted on me helping finish I jumped on the shrimp quesadilla (not really wanting to) and let me say it was delicious and packed with shrimp."}
{"text":"love the fact they have a drive thru. food is okay. the lady working the drive thru could be friendlier. there is always a long wait for the food even in the drive thru"}
{"text":"There were several choices in the area for Mexican food. But thanks to yelp, we found a gem. Yum yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered a grande breakfast burrito cut in two halves for an early Sunday morning repast. It came with chips, a small amount of salad and was enormous! I would estimate that it approached the size of two regular burros. We added carrots, onions, chills and salsas from the copious salsa bar for a complete meal. In fact, we could consume only half of the delicious, gargantuan feast and took the remaining half home for a second meal. This means the per person, per meal price calculates to $1.75! Astounding bargain for food of this quality and flavor."}
{"text":"Consistently outstanding good food and service. I come in on many Saturday mornings for their Chilaquile breakfast eggs served over-easy. Senor Burro, taco salads, and Flautas are outstanding values. Wish locations like this had drive-thrus and would replace Filibertos in the future."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly good. We've been eating here for at least a couple of years and have never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"This is your average Mexican, nothing great. Pros were generous portion sizes, inexpensive, rice and beans were very good but the burrito I had was average at best and slightly cold. The cons? My stomach is paying the price and revolting against the foreign substances that landed there."}
{"text":"Pretty good and consistent. The service is friendly. The food is great too. The rolled fish tacos and their Carnitas are their best items. Better than Fili-B's."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Fountain hills.  Locally owned and operated.  Shrimp burritos  (tacos) or surf and turf burritos are a must try.  Salsa bar is great.  I like the diablo sauce (not hot) good flavor.  There are 2 locations in Fountain Hills and both are great.  Ok my wife said I have to add carne asada burritos to the list!"}
{"text":"Walked in for breakfast.  Wasn't greeted; counter service person was on phone (didn't appear to be a business related conversation).  Burrito overpriced.  Originally asked for the \"Breakfast\" burrito.  The person behind the counter asked if we wanted it regular or grande, so we said, \"Grande!\"  Only to find out that she was talking about a completely different burrito, called the \"Grande Breakfast.\"  When trying to substitute sour cream for sausage, we were told that it'd be extra.  How is it at different restaurants when substituting one ingredient for another, there's no extra charge?  Not impressed with staff or place.  The booths are dirty and it's only 10:00am, plus the music is less than audible (I think there's music playing...)..  Head elsewhere if looking for better priced breakfast and a nicer atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Haven't been here in awhile but I still remember the quesadillas being bomb. This is a great fast Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my go to fast food mexican joint when I'm in the mood for something more authentic than Taco Bell. My only gripe about this place is that they have the standard refried beans from a can that most Mexican restaurants have. I had some authentic, homemade refried beans once and now I'm totally spoiled. Anything else just leaves me disappointed."}
{"text":"What a great place. Forget all the other taco shops. Senor Taco is my new favorite place. I went to visit my cousin and he took me there. I had the Diablo shrimp burrito and loved it and everytime I try something new it never fails. Give this place a try you wont regret it. Thank you guys for serving such great food at reasonable prices"}
{"text":"This would get 5 stars, except for how slow they are. Great food.

It's just so slow they take forever to give you your food"}
{"text":"I give this place four stars because sadly, this is the best Mexican place within 20 minutes of our house. The food is actually pretty good. It is the type of restaurant where you order at a counter and get your own drinks, they even have a drive-thru, so I find the prices a bit steep for what you get. If the prices were lower, I would give it 5 stars. Overall, I would recommend it."}
{"text":"GROSS! After seeing an employee use the restroom without washing his hands, I'm definitely giving this a 1 star (if only I could give a 0) 

I wasn't to pleased with my order (carne asada torta). The meat tasted like plastic... The bread was good, which is nice... They gave me six chips total with my torta. For $7.61 I guess it wasn't a total loss

Not coming back."}
{"text":"Yummy, price is right and the portions are huge.  Drive thru isn't as fast but worth the wait."}
{"text":"i always go here twice a week. in fact i am sitting here right know eating my lunch. unfortunately they were out of the delicious carrots at the condiment bar. but the young lady with glasses quickly filled it when i pointed it out that it was empty. what convinced me not to have them today was after she refilled it she twice dipped her hand into the container from the refrigerator to help herself to a snack. ewwwwwwwwwww.
How disgusting.!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Not only is the food good,but the horchata is freakin amazing!! Great customer service as well, Fernando will take hook you up, great dude!"}
{"text":"Always consistent and always better than the terrible fili b's down the street. Bomb ass salsa, food and service."}
{"text":"We have been going to Senor Taco for a while now, and never a bad experience. I nearly always order a cheese quesadilla and rolled tacos, and they are wonderful. The tacos are either chicken or beef, and are delicious either way. They come with a generous topping of tasty guac and cheese. I usually end up scooping the extra guac with my quesadilla, which is amazing. I don't know what they put in there, but it's absolutely my favorite part of the meal. And all of that for a little over five bucks. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Had their menudo, outstanding! Tons of meat and harmony...Worth the price and wait. I'll be back for sure...."}
{"text":"Good flavor for traditional Mexican food.  Cheese enchilada platter was tasty and as expected. Stars off for cleanliness. A huge priority in our book so we won't be back."}
{"text":"Big fan of the guac, enchiladas, and chicken chipotle burrito (amazing)! May take a little longer to get the food, but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Can i please give it a zero star review!!!!! My husband and I thought that we would give this place a try he got the chili verda burrito it looked like someone took the inside of a babies diaper that had the runs and dumped it into the burrito i got the carne asada and where  is the beans rice plus the first few bight are of tortilla this place is NASTY will never go back there"}
{"text":"I love this place soooooo much!!!!!! Their quality of meat is amazing!!!!! I can't get carne Asada from anywhere else now because I love theirs so much lol. Everything I've had here I've loved . Good job you guys are my favorite people. Yaaaaas"}
{"text":"Customer service sucks.  I ordered a to-go create-your own burrito.  When I got home, I found out the cashier rang up my order incorrectly.  I went back and tried to have my burrito replaced but the cashier accused me of putting in the wrong order instead of offering to rectify the situation.  I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not only is this staff incredibly rude and inconsiderate, they NEVER have a manager working when things go wrong there is nobody to talk to. I have literally been calling for a week! I have tired 3 times to give this place a shot, each time they have failed. They not only got my order wrong and failed to give me my whole order, but charged me twice! They weren't even busy, so there no excuse! So disappointed!! I won't ever eat here again! Employees are shit, I hope they hire all new staff."}
{"text":"This place has the best carne asada fries! Great size portions, prices aren't bad, and I just can't say enough how much I love the carne fries. I go here weekly."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since it opened about 8 years ago. The food is excellent and whats better is that the food is always consistent. 

My favorite thing to eat are the burritos and the rolled tacos. I highly recommend the california surfing or the diablo shrimp burrito. The staff is always nice and the place is always clean and the salsas very fresh.

Most of the employees have been there for many years which means they love their job and therefore the food they make is always good.

Thanks Señor Taco for being in my neighborhood all these years."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp burrito and it was excellent. 
Service was fast and it was served very hot. Will go again and would recommend to my friends! Muy bien"}
{"text":"Love the carnitas! So handy that they have a drive thru too. Better than many fancier sit down places!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan since my first visit when they first opened. Consistently perfectly cooked orders.  I get the steak burrito chimichanga style, served on shredded lettuce with sour cream and guacamole. It's so huge it has to be eaten with a knife and fork and I have to cut it in half for a second meal the next day.  The flavors dance all over my mouth.  I'm in love!"}
{"text":"Good food. Bad service. Needed container for the hot carrots and chilies and they wouldn't provide one. Offered to buy one and they still would not. Lost a customer. Many other good Mexican restaurants to choose from in the area."}
{"text":"Great food! Especially the hash brown burrito, my fave!!!! Orders take quite a while so I usually call ahead of time to avoid a wait."}
{"text":"Ordered one of the combo and asked if they could substitute the steak for chicken as I don't eat steak and the cashier girl said no problem. Order came and it was all steak. Went back to cashier (a different one was there) and told her this was wrong and she said that they can only substitute 1 for chicken (none of the item had chicken)... So they refused to fix my order. After going there many times, I will not go back or recommend to anyone..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Shrimp tacos are so good!! I will never eat any other mex food! Grande burrito is like 3 reg sized burritos! It's huge!"}
{"text":"Good fresh Mexican food. Not at all like Taco Bell. Real cheese, fresh guacamole, great salsa. I had lunch here three times and really enjoyed it. The service is quick and pleasant. They answered all my questions and helped me choose my items. The rolled tacos are my favorite. They even have a drive through window!"}
{"text":"Great find! Delicious, savory food with excellent attention to detail. Very authentic Mexican food. This doesn't taste like fast food. Great prices and super friendly staff. Thanks so much!!"}
{"text":"Do not eat the fish tacos unless you want to get really sick. Two days later my stomach is very bloated and I'm still feeling very sick, I have the chills. Not to mention that, the fish taco was very dry and not very good at all. I will never ever ever eat at this place ever again. I knew it always looked sketchy to begin with."}
{"text":"I think its a  little over  priced.anyways besides that the surf n turf burrito is really good."}
{"text":"Had REALLY bad food poisoning after eating here. I wouldn't recommend coming here for that reason. I was out of work for 3 days because if it. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Señor Taco is delicious!!  I love love love their red chile carne asada burrito. It might be a little on the spicy side for some, but it's amazing...beans, red chile, and carne...yum!!!  My kiddos always get some type of breakfast burrito and my husband switches between their carnitas and regular carne asada. So far everything's been amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Ok so the food at this place is good. But the customer service and especially the cook.....is very rude. I would not go back there again. Not worth it. : ("}
{"text":"Very good food and very affordable. My kids loved the salsa variety. Lots of seating inside."}
{"text":"When I first tried this place I probably would have given it a five star review. But I have been there several times since and now I'm a little less woohoo about this place. I love their quesadillas, they are huge and really fried :) I always have issues with the meat there. It's really grizzly.

 The last time I was there I took my grandparents and parents there. I got the hashbrown burrito, which is typically delicious. This time, I'm not sure what meat substance was in my burrito but it way way too chewy to be bacon. The staff was also cranky to my grandparents because they were confused at ordering. BUT the green salsa is super yummy!"}
{"text":"Tip: Try the the california surfing. Service is great and at affordable prices."}
{"text":"One of the perks of living in San Diego is that you're always within a block's distance of a Mexican taco shack that's open 24 hours. Being so close to the border, San Diego was always keen on delivering some great greasy drunk Mexican food. Nothing like carne asada fries to satisfy your cravings at 3 am in the morning. 

Well nowadays, I find myself roaming the suburban streets of Glendale, AZ, very much missing my Mexican food from southern California. And while AZ should boast some excellent Mexican food as well, Glendale in particular is lacking in yummy Mexican shacks with names that end in \"-Berto's.\"

But then Señor Taco appeared from nowhere, as if my prayers had been answered. Lo and behold, their California burrito is one of the best I've had. 

But oh snap, their surf n turf burrito is godly. Packed with super yummy shrimp with fresh citrusy flavor, all against the backdrop of a powerful carne asada background, and everything smothered in wonderful secret sauce. This place is the real deal.

One more thing. Free hot carrots. YESSSSS!!!!"}
{"text":"Line was painfully slow (drive through).  So slow in fact I comtemplated not ordering but once you are in the drive through you can't \"escape\" for lack of room.   Ordered 3 shredded beef, 3 shredded chicket hard shell tacos and 2 sides of guac for a total of $23.06.   Beef tacos were delicious.  Mom and I both dug into the chickent taco's at the exact same time and both were appalled that they tasted like fish.  We threw the Chicken tacos away.  I called and asked if they sold fish tacos (and they do).  I explained that somewhere in thier operations the fish got mixed with the chicken because our chicken tacos had an unmistakable fishy smell.   He apologized.  I asked if I could return  at a later time to get A) 3 replacement tacos or B) refund  and he replied \"We only allow refunds when the food in question is returned\".  Not wanting to return to the restaurant this evening, and not wanting to lug 3 fishy smelling chicken tacos w/ me, and not EVER wanting to wait in that line again I decided instead to eat the $8.67 loss and leave this review instead.    I will NEVER eat there or any Senor Tacos again."}
{"text":"Bomb burritos.

Go here with friends all the time.

Great Carne Asada. Recommend the green salsa.

They give chips if you go inside and order, but not if you drive thru which is unfortunate, but alas, such is life."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food and salsa. Great specials."}
{"text":"Last night was the first time I went to Senor Taco.  My other half had been there a number of times and never had a complaint other than the one you constantly read here:  long wait times; especially at the drive-thru.  But apparently, this varies.  Arriving there at 9pm on a Tuesday night, we didn't wait more than ten minutes before our order came out.  Granted, we ordered the daily special, which means it might have been pre-prepared or set up; but there definitely was no wait.

As to the variability in the food's quality some reviewers mention, I can only repeat what the other half has said:  the food has been consistently delicious.

I think one of the reasons people might have an unjustified complaint about wait times is the perception --- shared by me until arriving yesterday --- that Senor Taco is \"fast food\"; and of course, you thus expect \"fast delivery\".  But I take issue with that assessment.  Once you REALLY take a look around, you realize that it's significantly less a fast food place than, say, Taco Bell.  The menu is rather extensive (especially for a \"fast food\" joint) and everything's individually prepared (hence, the sometimes long wait).  In fact, compared to other Mexican restaurant menus I've looked through, this \"fast food\" place offers a lot more choices than many established restaurants!  Prices are higher than the typical fast-food joint; but, again, this isn't a fast food restaurant in the true sense of the word.  That misconception most likely contributes to disappointment for those expecting fast food, at cheap prices, served quickly; and surprised approval from those, who realize they're going to get a lot more for their buck than they previously thought.

I had the shrimp burrito and 2 fish tacos special.  At under $7 -- and a 12oz beverage was included -- it's a very reasonable deal.  The burrito was HUGE and unlike places like Taco Bell, there was a very favorable distribution of meat to rice in the wrap-up (Taco Bell tends to serve a LOT less meat and fill the rest up with copious amounts of rice and/or beans).  The taste of the shrimp burrito was also very good; and I'm no burrito fan.

Service was fast and very friendly.  Possibly the only complaint I have is that this is not the type of food I could eat on anything like a regular basis (and only let myself go there yesterday, because I had done a double treadmilling at the gym that day and was treating myself).

As far as I'm concerned, this \"fast food\" restaurant can hold its own against more established sit-down restaurants with extensive menu selections, which  -- from what I've seen -- still don't beat this place for the variety of plates offered and the low prices.  

The only negative, as far as I'm concerned, is the blaring TV and music ... but show me a Mexican restaurant, which DOESN'T share that affliction?

Open til 11pm, Senor Taco also offers lots of good food at good prices, without having to rush over there when you don't want to eat, because most restaurants in the Valley close at 8 or 9pm during the week.

When I go out for Mexican food now and again, it's usually for fish (for reasons of health).  Should I decide at any given time to have some other kind of Mexican food, I see no reason to drive through the Valley looking for anything better unless it's simply a matter of trying something new.  Senor Taco is more than capable of meeting your Mexican food cravings and doing it at a price that won't have you taking out a second mortgage on the house."}
{"text":"Good fast-food mexican taqueria type food. The bean burrito and rolled tacos are good. I love that now they offer whole wheat tortillas. Their salsa bar is amazing with 3 types of salsa, spicy carrots, onion mix, and fire roasted chiles. Yum."}
{"text":"I am not impressed with the slow service... Forgot my order... I ordered the breakfast burrito. Not a lot of flavors. Diablo salsa just ok."}
{"text":"Just  moved across  town, looking  for a new, quick go to place.  3 of us went and we're very full, for less than $20.  Food was very goid.  Service was great, and restaurant  was clean.  Will go back!"}
{"text":"Yummy, fresh and delicious food! 
Nothing tastes greasy, old or bland. 
Large portions."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food! The ham & cheese quesadilla was excellent and the cheese enchilada combo plate was great! My husband had a veggie burrito and loved it. We will definitely go back! I recommend take-out."}
{"text":"I love tacos.  That said, my friends call me the Taco Hunter.  This is my favorite place.  Affordable, consistent and amazing food.  I have not had a bad meal here.  The owner is amazing.  They even cater.  We had them cater a party and everybody was blown away by the food.  You can find more expensive tacos but not better tacos."}
{"text":"I like going here for lunch.  The food is always good and the lunch combos are pretty reasonably priced. The place is always clean and the service is friendly.  I've been here about 6 times over the last year and plan to go back.   I usually have rolled tacos or the two enchilada deal.  I'd say 4.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Ordered the shredded beef tacos. They were delicious. Lots of meat and cheese. Shell was perfectly cooked. Salsa was good. My wife is from Mexico and they exceeded her standards for a good hard shell taco. Drive through service was fast and efficient. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Got two crunchy breakfast chipotle burritos--- called ahead, ready when I arrived. Added hash-browns to one... Super yummy. It was crunchy inside, savory and with a kick for sure. I recommend stopping by, great service always with a smile and very clean. Try the green salsa for sure! 
TIP: drive-thru sometimes takes a while, but if my food is fresh and yummy I'll wait."}
{"text":"The only reason why I gave this place 2 stars is because they have a drive thru and when I placed my order on the phone it was ready in 10 minutes. The food is just ok, like you would find at a much cheaper price from a Filibertos. I expected to find something special about their food since their prices were higher then I usually pay, but it wasn't. My kids got the rolled tacos and when I tried one it was bland and greasy. I got the chicken fajita quesadilla, and was very disappointed. The quesadilla was more like a burrito with so much filling that the entire bottom was soggy and in edible. The onions and peppers inside were cut in so many different sizes that some pieces were burnt and some weren't cooked at all. My husband got the taco enchilada plate. The sauce had way too many different flavors going on.  The only part of the meal that was good was the rice. I will it be going back to this place because I can get better food for less money here in chandler. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"First time trying the California burrito and it was awesome! It's the best I've ever tried from Cali to AZ"}
{"text":"Great food every time.  Recommend the Carne Asada burrito or fish tacos.  Just don't ask for extra napkins.  Apparently salsa is free but napkins are rationed."}
{"text":"Every bit as good as the one in Fountain Hills without the extra drive for me. Burro and tacos were loaded. Staff was friendly and food was prepared quickly. Great value. Definitely recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Dude, Senor taco is where it's at for fresh, somewhat fast mexican food. The meat is high quality which is a weird thing to be able to say about fastish food. Im not going to lie, the carne asada fries are probably the best I've ever had. Please never ever change or leave Senor Taco!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp burrito this evening and it was top notch. My first time here, so I ordered a few items just to see. Their salsa was fresh and the portion sizes were generous. I also ordered the 2 soft taco combination with carnitas and carne asada. Both soft tacos were excellent. The staff was friendly and I was more than happy with my food. I will definitely be returning for more now that I'm hooked on the shrimp burrito!"}
{"text":"I think Senor Taco is one of the best at what it is - fast Mexican food.  Of course, I've had better Mexican food at a full service restaurant, but not in this price range.  I can only speak about the burritos because that is all I ever get (I keep saying I will try something different, but I can't seem to quit the burritos). Carne Asada burrito - great.  Surf & turf burrito - awesome.  Grande breakfast burrito - sooo good and must weigh about 3 pounds, I love this one.  Good salsa, too.  I feel very happy when I come in here, anticipating my burrito.  I feel very sleepy when I leave here after eating it."}
{"text":"I had a carne asada burrito and kid had carne asada with red chile and wet burro style. Meat tasted good but burro was little skinny on meat content and lots of tortilla bites. $17 for just two burro and waters bit too pricey. It wasn't all that different than any other burro joints."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.

Their portions are huge, but their prices aren't.  I've been here over 30 times and the food is always really good.  I just got a HUGE breakfast burrito with steak, eggs, cheese and potatoes for only $5.29, you can't beat that!

Their carne asada nachos are huge enough for two people.  I always like their carne asada quesedillas too.  Those are just my preferences, but the tacos are huge and cheap, the rolled tacos are tasty, the fish taco comes with lots of fish... you see where I'm going.  

Make sure to stop in and try their red sauce, they're really good, and I particularly like their spicy onions!  

Go here, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Way better than fillabertos. If your looking for good Mexican, this place beats any sit down restaurant and has a drive threw"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I highly recommend it. Señor taco is clean, friendly staff and has great food. It isn't like your typical Mexican fast food restaurant. The flavors here are just as good if not better than any Mexican sit down restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Portions are huge! Some orders can feed up 3 people easily, and the servings are worth the money. Try the agua fresca, as all the flavors are good and not too sweet.  
Wish they brought back ceviche on the menu, as they recently removed it."}
{"text":"Husband wanted to try out, it was oh so good! We both had the Diablo Shrimp Burrito, and let me say it will not disappoint you! Has a nice little salsa bar, free refills, and a cozy small lobby! Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place - authentic, fresh Mexican food. I went there for the first time with my sister and was amazed at the good quality of the food and the service and the cleanliness of the place.  I just had a meal there with my dad.  We have found our new favorite Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"A little more expensive than Filiberto's but the service and food is very good.  The shrimp burrito is delicious!  As the restaurant is a little small with only a few tables, it's not really built for more than 7-10 people to be sitting and eating at one time.  They do a robust drive-through and take-out business."}
{"text":"It was alright, the burrito was pretty good but the water tasted like they pumped it out of a nearby pool and the chairs and benches were probably about as comfortable as the floor. The food there is pretty good though."}
{"text":"CARNE ASADA FRIES!!!!!!

The food is yummy and well priced. Easy to get in and out for lunch. The whole serving of fries is huge so order the half if you arent hungry!"}
{"text":"Had the tacos and they were fantastic! Loved the topping bar with a variety of sauces and condiments."}
{"text":"Street tacos were good. Fish taco nice. Nachos made with cheese sauce (boo). Crazy overdone menu."}
{"text":"We drive up here to eat from Casa Grande ,the food is delicious and the customer service is fantastic! The prices are very good for the high quality food you get. My husband always orders the shrimp quesadilla. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow! 
Came in here on the reviews of other Yelpers, SO glad we did. 

Got the California Surfin burrito (amazing), the chile relleno, the beef tamale, and the camarones en el Diablo. 

So much food, and all so freaking good."}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love this place. My absolute favorite menu item has to be the shrimp avocado Caesar salad. My family enjoys a couple different value combos and the shrimp quesadilla. Everything we had is huge and totally shareable. Give it a try and see what you think. TONS of options."}
{"text":"mmm, this is chain mexican food that I will eat when I am sober...  That is saying enough if you ask me!

ok ok ok, Senor Taco is muy delicioso.  It is real similar to say a Filiberto's but super clean and efficient.  Similar salsa bar setup with the weird jalapeno and carrot mixture that when you ask what it is called they tell you, \"Jalapenos and Carrots?\"

Carne Asada is the bomb and I enjoy their California burrito.  Think all the unhealthy things you can put in a burrito... Sour cream, guacamole, potatoes, beans... yum.  

Biggest downfall is the measly six chips they give you with your meal.  I am sure you could probably get some more if you wanted them though since they are always super nice.

The salsa are aight.

Oh an the 10% student discount they give me when I wear my nerdy name badge... ohhh yeah.

Go there and enjoy some chain mexican food.

You know you want to!"}
{"text":"Two words, \"stomach ache.\" No bueno. I had the worst stomach ache after eating a half order of carne asada fries. It totally sucked that they already had the carne asada cooked. I saw the cook spoon out a carne asada in a metal container. If it was freshly cooked right in place of the order, the quality would be way ~ better. I was pretty disappointed. The salsa bar was pretty unfortunate. I didn't like the salsa because it wasn't fresh and was very thick for the taste. I've tried better. The food was way too salty too."}
{"text":"Went here for cinco de mayo. Wasn't looking for anything in particular but the fish tacos sounded good. I had two of them and the fish was cold. It's fast food mexican I suppose so it is what it is."}
{"text":"OMG.... I have been coming to the original location for many years.... Just had some drama at the new location with the cashier... She couldn't understand my English and had to correct the order and was very upset!   Come to find out SHE 'S THE MANAGER!!! Funny!  And to think she's the one training others in customer service!
I want the business to survive so I hope she improves ..... Or someone helps her move on!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm. Huge menu. Don't be intimidated. Just yell out shredded beef taco, carne asada burrito, or chips. You can't lose. Simply melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"The best Mexican in the area. Made to order and always hot. Order at the counter and they bring to your table.  My favs are the tacos, beans & tortillas! It's never very crowded for dinner. I hope this place survives!"}
{"text":"Please drain the meat before it goes into the flour shell bowl. I had to go home and pour a lot of water-like juice out of it and the bowl was very very soggy. 
Giving you 4 stars because everything else is good."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food at a pretty good price! If you've got a low budget and want Mexican better than Taco Bell or Del Taco, this is the place to go! They also have a drive thru."}
{"text":"The best Mexican fast food in town. Stopped by at their location on Fountain Hills Blvd for a carne asada soft taco. Taco was loaded with meat and very tasty. Employees are friendly. The fish tacos are the best. Don't go there for the ambience but when you want good Mexican food, no better place local."}
{"text":"This could be my one and only review for a west side biz. Nothing against you Westsiders but I rarely venture past Central Ave. So I found myself working out here in the area and took a gamble, without even using Yelp walked in for some lunch. I mean, it's Mexican, how bad can it be. 

I guess the best way to describe this is it's similar to a Baja Fresh. They have a fresh salsa bar which was amazing!! You can get your burrito \"wet\" (my favorite). I ended up getting their enchilada plate. They have it on special right now, $4.99 for their combo plate. The ingredients tasted fresh as far as I could tell. The rice was fully and tasted good. 

It's your typical fast casual Mexican joint, and judging by all the chain stores/restaurants in the area, this place is a good bet you'll get a good meal. 

Oh, gotta give props to our cashier guy, we told him it was our first time and he hooked it up with 2 free drinks. He was pretty helpful in helping us order since they had so many good looking things on the menu. 

One last note, Surf and Turf Burrito is pretty good apparently. 

Protip: Want to feel a little less guilty about that burrito your ordering, for .25 cents more, get a whole wheat tortilla."}
{"text":"*UPDATE: I got sick from the tacos and it was a crappy experience all last light - literally. :( I feel like my body was hit by a freight train, and still does this morning. Had to call out of work, and I had chills in my body all night including pain. Wow. Never going there again. They need to step up their game.

So I really love Senor Taco, but this location was a miss for this first visit. I've been to two other more popular and busy locations across Phoenix that open till 2 am and the food there was much more noticeably fresher than this location, including the salsa bars. I don't blame them, from what I understand this location tends to be slower, and it was towards the end of their night shift - 10 pm. I was super excited to share my favorite \"taco\" place, but was disappointed by the fish being dry, along with the corn tortillas. The salsa bar here I could tell by the end of the night had been sitting there for a long while, being dry along the edges. Nonetheless, it was still \"good\". Just not the killer good I am used to at the other locations. I feel bad for this location, as it has potential. I also learned a bad taco place used to be here before they took ownership, so maybe that affected the business - from others who remember the old place and prefer not to give this new place a try? I don't know. I look forward to eating at the other locations in which I had always been blown away by each and every time. I was hoping tonight would have been one of those times. Not sure if I will try this location again. It was rather small compared to the other ones I've been to also. Portions seemed the same by the way. Just not as noticeably fresh. For such a great price, I suppose I can't complain."}
{"text":"Our family loves Senor Taco! Everything is good especially the Carne Asada plate, nachos, and burrito. Food is fresh, servings are big enough to share and the price is right. The green salsa is amazing!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the DRIVE THRU takes a million years! Drive thru customers should be serviced immediately. I should not have to wait 15 minutes to get my food. It is really quicker to go inside and order your food."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is SO AMAZING! Unbelievably tasty. We ordered the California Burrito, Chimichanga, the Fajita Burrito, all with beans and rice. The three of us could not find ONE FAULT! Everything was so delicious. It is hard to find good Mexican food in Phoenix area. Everything is usually bland and generic everywhere we have gone. NOT HERE! They do not skimp on the portions or the amount of meat they put in their food. The salsa bar was amazing as well. I wish I could give this place 10 stars. Go here now. And I forgot to mention how clean the store was."}
{"text":"This my favorite Mexican food place in AZ. Their burritos are so flavorful and big. No matter what I've gotten,  from Chilaquiles to the Senor Burro, it has been fantastic. My family is very picky and we can all agree on Senor Taco."}
{"text":"Simply great food at very reasonable prices.  Gracious, friendly staff, bikers welcome.    I LOVE this place."}
{"text":"Señor taco is one of our favorite places, the food is authentic  Mexican food. We like the steak and egg burritos, the pollo asado and the ceviche tostada."}
{"text":"Freshly made tortillas, delicious ingredients, cheap prices, and a salsa bar make this our go-too mexican place. The Surf & Turf burrito is amazing- shrimp, steak, veggies, rice and a creamy chipotle sauce."}
{"text":"The food is good for the price!!

The bad part is that when my bill is $5.39 and I hand you $6, I expect the change.  I was going to put it in the tip jar, but instead the girl took my money then just walked off.  If I would have given you a $20 would you have kept the change then too?"}
{"text":"Favourite restaurant in Arizona. Doesn't look fancy but the food is amazing. Definitely miss living in Arizona. I hit up this joint everything I fly back south from Toronto. 

California Surfing - chimichanga style is godly."}
{"text":"Extremely satisfied with the quality and price! I had used them for my sons birthday party and they gave me the best quality and best price! I was so satisfied the lady (Lily) that helped me out was so understanding and she worked with my budget! My guest loved the food! Extremely convenient if you don't want to cook. When I picked it up they even helped me take it to my vehicle. I definitely recommend Señor Taco to anyone that wants real Mexican food for there party! I give them 10 STARS!"}
{"text":"What burrito comes with no beans cheese or rice... what a lame experience. Won't return"}
{"text":"I've eaten here three days in a row now. It's two minutes from my house. I've passed it a thousand times and would never consider eating here, because the location isn't Enticing or interesting. 
Six of us girlfriends had a garage sale this past weekend and one of the girls went there to get us all food. The chips and salsa were delicious. The tacos were awesome. The salad was wonderful.  They also have good Coke products.... It's cheap and from the looks of it, they make the meat to order, that's why it might take longer, as some Yelp people are complaining about the long wait.   My third day in a row eating here, so it's definitely good."}
{"text":"Our first time here, pleasantly surprised by Senor Taco.  Outside looks like a fast food place, but we were told it had good food.

Husband had combo plate with chicken and beef soft tacos, beans, rice, horchata, and guacamole. Very good. I had three rolled beef tacos with guacamole. Also very good. 

Clean restaurant. Pretty busy at lunch time. We will be back"}
{"text":"I have been here several times.  I really like their cheese quesadilla and the chimichangas have been pretty good.  I prefer it over Papa Chevo's and Filibertos.  Portions are good size.  

I do find it odd that it is right across from Garcia's but hey, that's wonderful Chandler, AZ for you."}
{"text":"First time at Senor Taco. I had the shredded beef burrito chimichanga style. I thought it was really good. The beef had good flavor. Definitely recommend the mild salsa smothered on the burrito - perfect mix of flavors. The only thing I would have preferred was the cheese melted on top - it was added cold but warmed by the heat of the burrito, it wasn't bad, just would have been better completely melted."}
{"text":"I love their rolled tacos. So easy to drive through or call ahead a d pick it up. It's affordable and they never skimp on the guacamole!"}
{"text":"First time visitor and was not disappointed in the carne asada tacos. The extra sauces to spice things up a bit were also appreciated."}
{"text":"After a half a dozen times eating here I finally gave up, the place is so inconsistent and the service is slow. The last few times whether it was drive through or eat in, the food has been cold and poorly and sloppily prepared. When I talk about poorly prepared I'm talking about the inconsistency in how they prepare their combo beef taco plates (sometimes they're filled with toppings and meat and sometimes they're not) and how their refried beans look like they've been sitting in the kitchen for longer then it should be. As far as their salsa bar, some times the the salsa is watered down and sometimes it's not. While the food is decently priced and I want to support local businesses, this place is a disappointment."}
{"text":"I went in to try this place for the first time during lunch time. Foods was great, everything was fresh and prepared just right. Customer service, not so much. Person taking orders had a attitude and was no help at all. Overall, I would eat here again only because the food is good."}
{"text":"We drive 20 mins out of our way to get their chilaquiles! Great service, fast and TASTE AMAZING!! The store is clean and they have an all you can handle salsa bar. YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good fish tacos! Didn't like the shrimp taco tho. Chips & guac were delicious. Will come back to try breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Oh my god. The most amazing food!  And cheap! Giant California steak and shrimp burrito, giant vegetarian burrito, and a soft taco with drinks $23."}
{"text":"I met my Wife here yesterday for lunch at noon. Since I had no breakfast, I am sure I got sick here. I had one of their shrimp dishes and started feeling sick before I even left the restaurant. I was in our bathroom most of the night, and could not sleep all night. I have never felt so bad. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Food was okay if you're craving that taco shop stuff but I probably wouldn't go again of its up to me. I ordered a 2 taco plate that comes with rice and beans, it was a good amount of food in the order."}
{"text":"Awesome fish tacos! Love this place, always clean and friendly!"}
{"text":"We were looking  for a quick bite to eat so thought we would try Senior Taco  over Del Taco.  We were pleasantly surprised with how good it was.  The tacos are pretty big so one would have been enough for me.  We ordered 4 tacos:  chicken, beef, fish and pork.  All were good, but the fish and beef really stood out.  They have a nice salsa bar.  The place was clean and the employees were friendly.  The food came out hot and quick.  Looking forward to our return when we next visit AZ."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I always get the chorizo breakfast burrito. The green salsa is amazing. I add hash browns and cheese to the burrito as well. Service is super fast, even with a line in the drive threw, i have never waited crazy long."}
{"text":"Have had 2 bad experiences here... very poor customer service... called in an order to pick up and  they got it wrong... would not fix it... so disappointed...last time going there which is too bad cause food is pretty good."}
{"text":"5 stars for their $1.99 fish Taco, I prob have them three to five times a month. I work at a neighboring business so it is convenient for me to order my lunch to go and not have to rush and eat.
I also like their Salsa bar that always has fresh cut limes for the taking (FREE)

NO STARS FOR THE FOLLOWING :

I have tried the Carne Esada Burrito and the Pollo soft taco and shrimp tacos....On those days I spent my lunch returning my food for  100% refund. I got my money back but had no lunch because I refused to eat slimy shrimp, gritty chicken and dry Carne.

I ASKED FOR A LARGE CUP OF WATER AND THEY WATED TO CHARGE ME $2.00 FOR A PAPER CUP!! REALLY? A PAPER CUP..... I think not.

I am not a fan of commercial guacamole so I asked to substitute sour cream (white sauce) instead of the guac and they wanted to charge me $1.00. really? Guacamole  is way more expensive to make and maintain....I'm saving you money buddy and you want to charge me a dollar to do that. Umm, NO.

NOT to mention the staff is less than patient with your decision making process, always on their cell phones and I am bilingual so when u talk about me in Espanol....I know what your saying.  BOOM!"}
{"text":"We really love the food at Senior Taco. I love the carnitas tortas and actually got it based on the recommendation of the owner once when we went in. Sometimes I will get the carnitas flour shell bowl and that it a lot of food! It is a bit on the pricey side and I have had some issues with the employees not knowing what I am asking for, but despite that, I continue to come back bc the food is good. The owner of this chain often is working and he is super friendly. Try their carnitas! :)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food in east Mesa.  The drive through is a bit odd,  but the product served is fantastico! This is coming from a native Chicagoan where the delicious burritos are as big as your head, and the population's bodies are living proof."}
{"text":"I have never been to a fast food restaraunt with eat-in quality food. I went again for the 4th time and this time had the Shrimp burrito for a second time,very tasty. This time I had them put the pico de gallo and other items that come in it on the side and it was still delicious. We sat in and had chips and salsa which is a great treat here. They offer a variety of salsas that are very flavorful and not just a watered down tomato and chili flake sauce. The 2 fish tacos that come with the meal are a generous addition to an already huge burrito served along with rice and beans. The people are friendly, the service is quick and it is very convenient all around."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, but most of the restaurants left me with a heartburn afterwards or the greasy smell and heavy stomach, but NOT Senior Taco. I love the freshness of the food and the the salsa bar. The price is very affordable and the portion is HUGE."}
{"text":"Yummy! 

Love love love their sauces here! Combine that with the carne asada fries and I am in heaven! The fries comes out crispy and full of toppings! They for sure load those babies up. An interesting thing that they do is add beans to their fries which I don't mind because I like beans but not many places add beans so if you don't like beans make sure you let them know. 

The staff is super friendly and helpful.

Definitely recommend this place! (:"}
{"text":"Can't believe they have already been open a year. Great spot when I want something between fast food Mexican and white linens on the table Mexican food. Great menu choices. The salsa bar is solid. If you are going with a friend or two, or just haven't eaten in a few days, try the breakfast grande."}
{"text":"We have been patrons of Senor Taco, this is specific location, for years! You've always been very happy with the food, it's delicious. That being said, last night we went through the drive-thru and ordered 5 meals. When we got home (20 minutes away), we realized that one of our meals was missing. I called the store and let them know. There only resolution was for us to drive 20 minutes and they would make the item. Ironically, it was one of the least expensive of the five meals. I asked for them to give me a refund over the phone and they declined and kept reciting their return policy. I tried to explain to them over and over that I wasn't returning something that they forgot an item and she said she had no authority to do so. So, today I drove back to the store, the manager, Abraham, was not there as promised. I went back and forth with him and finally one of the employees said that she could refund the money but that was it. So after one of our family members missing out on their meals and me having to drive 20 minutes they're only resolution and \"customer service\" was to refund mean for the food they never gave me in the first place. It was literally, the least they could do! The employee called the manager on the phone and he wouldn't even take the time to speak to me over the phone. With so many options available in the area I would no longer recommend Senor Taco. In fact, Cafe Rio just opened up on the same block. If you haven't been to Cafe Rio before I would highly recommend! We've also been patrons of Cafe Rio for years and love it! Very excited that they are finally in the North East Valley."}
{"text":"I came inside to order. As this was my first time here, I decided to go in so any questions I may have could be answered. I asked \"what is the size difference between a small or large order of the carne asada fries?\" Gesturing with my hands so I could visualize how large an order would be---to determine how much food each would include. The worker replied, \"the difference is one's small and the other is large\". No kidding. I guess I can't expect people working here to be geniuses, but this guy wasn't all there and was rude and not helpful. 

I just went with a large size and it was nearly 12 dollars. Way too much food and too expensive for one person. He could have said that the small is enough food for one person vs the large is enough for 20 people!!!!! I also came at 11 when no one was in line or inside. It took my one item 20+ minutes because they served the drive thru first. Wasted my money. Don't recommend"}
{"text":"I never do drive thru because the food is so fresh, tasty and good it needs to be eaten Now, not in 15-20 minutes. The Carne Asado soft taco, Chicken Tostada and Tortas are crazy good . The salsa bar w carrots is just frosting on a great cake, and don't get me started on the Machaca."}
{"text":"Just had the chicken tacos and was compelled to leave a review (well, that and I'll be number 100 on the review list). In a day when \"tastes like chicken\" has turned this meat into a somewhat generic flavor, señor taco has turned it around!  This chicken is very nicely flavored, not greasy, and altogether pretty delightful!  Chips, beans, and ice tea were above average as well. Only thing I might ask for is something a bit more original in the salsa department. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed to have to leave a bad review but my girlfriends and I are constantly getting screwed by this location. My girlfriend usually orders a bean and cheese burrito with carne Asada  and they always charge her a different price the worst it has been was when they charged her $10 for it and when we questioned the lady at the window she said \"there is no bean and cheese burrito on the menu\" which there is so she charged her for a bean burrito with cheese and carne added to it and rudely insisted that we were wrong and we just now got home and I found out that my burrito was about half the size it should be. The uneaten burrito is my carne-asada burrito next to a bean and cheese burrito. The food is good but the service is getting worse and worse."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants..love the California burrito and surfin California. Huge burritos can never finish them."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!   And the prices are great!  I am addicted!!  The breakfast, veggie, carne asada and chile relleno burritos are amazing!!  I had the chilaquilles today and they did not disappoint.  The employees are really friendly and the service is quick and the food is so fresh.  The place is clean.  I would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"For quick Mexican they were awesome!!!  I think Yelp has their address wrong for the restaurant in chandler on Arizona.  For us it was a great place to eat where it was not greasy and gross.  The churros are amazing too!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I went for our normal breakfast burritos and sadly the cheese was still frozen. We order the hashbrown burrito. When we took the burritos back they refused to give us a new burrito or to refund our money back. We were simply told that the cheese is sprinkled on top and is not melted.My concern was why was my cheese frozen then? Very rude customer service. We decide we won't go back there. Don't you think they would rather keep a loyal paying customer then lose us as customer all together?!"}
{"text":"I pass 3 other Mexican food places to visit this location. Ceviche tosatadas are amazing. Thanks for new location in Aj. Right by my house."}
{"text":"This place is really good for a fast food Mexican joint. Had a couple bean tostadas, rice and beans. The rice is exceptional and is the best I've had. The rest of the meal was good for a decent price.

Highly recommend this place when fast Mexican is needed."}
{"text":"Not a bad place.  Kind of reminds me of a Baja Fresh but with a lot more food.  I'm still searching for the perfect TexMex.  This place definitely wasn't it but my fish tacos were fresh and tasty.  That's A-OK by me!"}
{"text":"It's not fast food, but it's good food... made to order. The prices are reasonable and they have deals on particular days. The staff is friendly and willing to help. Definitely worth the stop if you're passing by."}
{"text":"If I could give this store no stars, I would. Hours state opens at 7am. Ah. No. That's when the staff shows up. Once they get in, expect to sit and wait for them to open up. Another 15 mins. Very enthusiastic bunch."}
{"text":"I always get the shrimp burrito! The best shrimp burrito I've ever had! You get big plump shrimp in every bite! I have yet to try anything else because I love that burrito so much I have to get it every time lol. But the chips and green salsa they have is also delicious. I will definitely try other things on the menu when I get a chance :)"}
{"text":"Decent food, TERRIBLE SERVICE! I sat in my car waiting on drive thru for 30 min and never received my food. I was second in line and so myself and the 6 other cars behind me all left. Also, be aware of possibly getting the stomach flu or food poisoning...it happened to myself and a buddy of mine. Not sure if it was an ingredient in the food or improperly cooked. Who knows? Eat at your own risk. But will I come back? Ehh Maybe."}
{"text":"Same great food, same great service. Much closer to me with this new location! YUM !"}
{"text":"I've seen many restaurants come and go in this location over the years, I like this one best. Service is always nice. Food cooked quickly. Tastes delicious and fresh hope this place sticks around."}
{"text":"Rice and beans are delicious!! Salsas are great! Not watered down. I ordered the grilled chicken tacos and they were very good!"}
{"text":"This is the closest mexican food to socal type that I have found. The california burrito is bomb love this place a++"}
{"text":"Am addicted to the shrimp burrito.  Just addicted. 
Thank you Senor Taco."}
{"text":"Have only been once, had steak and egg burrito and it was excellent.  The fact that you can get a grilled pepper to go with it is a bonus.  Salsa could be better, but the food was great."}
{"text":"I went back and had nachos this time...Wow! They were the bomb.com! Creamy cheese (and a lot of it), pico, guac, sour cream... Yumm Yumm
As you can see I've tried the chicken salad and the shrimp tacos are a new favorite!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here quite a few times. The food is really good! However, there needs to be an upgrade in the speaker system because I am a
Loud talker and I am constantly having to repeat myself, and I can't think of anything more annoying right now than having to repeat myself 10 times in the drive through, although the employees are always very nice. It's time for an upgrade!"}
{"text":"So I used to come here back in the days of this place's previous incarnations - both Luna Pizza and Dos Amigos Fresh Mex Grill. Both of those places served alcohol. This place is a fast food chain so none of that here. Too bad. I've eaten here a couple of times and did take out a number of times. I've actually never seen this place crowded. Then again, I don't drop in at primetime. Hands down the best thing here IMHO is their Diablo Shrimp Burrito. They make it with their signature Diablo Sauce and that actually has some kick to it. Usually when some place claims a dish is \"spicy\" I take it with a grain of salt - or actually with a couple of spoonfuls of added hot sauce. The Diablo Shrimp burrito, however, actually IS spicy and not just \"gringo spicy.\" So beware in case you're one of those people that thinks those spicy Taco Bell packets are actually spicy."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst señor taco in the whole state there staff is vary lazy and they can't get the food right they gave me vegetarian nachos when I order a burrito honestly the worst stop. Wasting me money not to mention they take for ever just to order one thing I am a frequent customer of the power location and that one is great but this location honestly a dump"}
{"text":"Half the time the girls working are nice, half the time are rude.  The clearly hate their job.  Food is good, but stick with the tacos.  They are best in the menu.  Enchiladas are not impressive.  Burros are ok."}
{"text":"Been here twice - the best Mexican in the valley by far - wish it wasn't so far away!  Fish and shrimp tacos - fantastic!  Green chili burrito is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Always been a fan of Senor Taco - hands down best breakfast burritos I've ever had in the southwest. But I'm just so lazy when it comes to driving and Fountain hills is way too far for me.

Thankfully this location is still going strong near Raintree and 101. It still has all the great selections from the other locations - the great burritos, a killer diablo salsa, and great prices and specials. What I especially like are additional options like half orders of carne asada fries - they're great but nobody ain't got time for that by themselves.

Personal recommendations? My favorite is the hash brown burrito - great amounts of everything and a really flavorful sausage I can't pinpoint at any other restaurant I've been to. Chorizo and egg is packed to the brim of course. And the diablo salsa is a must - a great kick and addition to any burrito."}
{"text":"Been to another location in the valley but we keep coming back to this one 
Can't go wrong with carne asada burrito ... Their flour tortilla is off the hook! If you're carbing it up, order carne asada fries. I love their steak and eggs breakfast burrito. Their red sauce is so good"}
{"text":"For fast Mexican Food, Senor Taco hit the mark in a good way.  Generous servings, fair prices, above average food quality.  The mild and tomatillo salsas are good.  I often judge a place on how good the beans and rice are. This place again hits the mark, way above average!  Friendly service, generally clean little place..."}
{"text":"I am trying o understand why Yelp took down my first review - I would like to hear from Yelp about this - this place is great but Yelp pulls my review   -  please message me why if you read this Yelp  My voice should be heard not stepped on"}
{"text":"I like this place.   Clean.  Affordable.  Good fast food.   If I was giving a suggestion for improvement I'd add something cool, light, sweet and soothing as a desert for after the spicy Mexican food:  either soft serve ice cream or yogurt.   The deserts they have seem heavy.    But apart from that this is a good place."}
{"text":"Just \"o.k.\" Mexican food.  Better to go with a smaller business than something franchised like this (exception to this is Filibertos)"}
{"text":"3 strikes you're out
All 4 times with Uber 
1st Time I got food from there the carne asada quesadilla was dripping in grease completely inedible.
2nd time they totally forgot an order and I had to go pick it up.... kinda defeats the purpose of uber eats
3rd time ordered a number 4 combo no beans double rice. Supposed to be a beef taco and beef tostada. The tostada was just beans no beef and they gave me beans and rice not double rice. 

Annnnd I'm done!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!
Haven't been inside yet, but the food is awesome!! Love the fish tacos and red chili carne asada burrito!"}
{"text":"Yum. That is all you need to really know. 
Yuuuuummmm

Ppl complain about the drive through which is so ridiculous. Its great food that appears to be made fresh to order. Wait the extra minute ppl."}
{"text":"three rolled tacos with rice and beans. Rolled tacos were okay, beans so-so, rice awful, like Uncle Bens with almost no flavor. Red sauce was horrible, tasted like it came from a can."}
{"text":"We lived in Ft. Hills for many years and enjoyed Senor Taco on Shea Blvd. Five years ago when they opened another one on Ft. Hills Blvd, even closer.
Our favorites are Surf and Turf and Carnitas burritos. 

We moved to Mesa a few years ago and found their location on McKellips and Power and were super excited to be close. Great for breakfast, lunch dinner! Check them out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The California Surfin' burrito is something I always get when I go there. Their salsa is also very good! Definitely worth having over and over again!"}
{"text":"TL;DR: Everything is \"just right\".

A hidden gem. Nothing super special, but for what it is, this is a s good as it gets. 

The location is clean. Decor is nice.

Food is good to very good. A little better than your typical -bertos.

Prices are just right. 

I wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"This place is pretty delectable for a fast food joint. I grew up eating delicious authentic Mexican food regularly, so when I find a place like Señor Taco I get pretty amped. My boyfriend and I came here on a whim for lunch and were pleasantly surprised by the portions, prices and quality. The cashier was very kind and patient as we scoped out the menu to decide what to try. I ended up ordering the #6 daily special that came with 3 rolled tacos smothered in guacamole, a quesadilla and a 20 oz drink for $8.49. My boyfriend opted for the señor burrito which was $9.99. Before we payed the cashier asked us if we knew how big the burrito would be. We said we didn't and she said it was pretty big (the length of a tray). My boyfriend decided to get it anyway with the idea of taking the rest home for dinner if there was any leftover.

My goodness. The cashier was not exaggerating the size of the señor burrito. Not only was it massive in length, but it was stuffed with flavorful ingredients. My boyfriend barely finished half of the burrito and that was an impressive feat in itself. My plate was also a generous size and after eating the rolled tacos I was pretty full. 

In short we are both full, satisfied and happy with our meal and experience. We'll definitely be back and eager to try out their other options."}
{"text":"Great place. Love visiting family in fountain hills because we get to go to señor taco. Always good quick service. Food is awesome. Last time I went my sisters and I got taco salads and they were prepped perfectly and came out within minutes. Love a good place with great food and good customer service. We'll definitely be coming back shortly."}
{"text":"Love the quick food but great quality. Their California surfing burrito is to die for"}
{"text":"This is by far the best fast food Mexican restaurant I've ever enjoyed!

It is now a regular tradition for me every payday, dinner from Senor Taco!

They have some daily specials and other good deals, but most of the prices are medium on the price range for fast food, about $5-8 per entree.  The servings are VERY generous (muy generoso), so I usually have leftovers for later.

The food is always freshly made to order, so it does take longer than your typical fast food, nothing like Taco Bell.  If you just want a late night run to the border for some really cheap and fast crappy tex-mex, then this is not your place.

If you want some really good food for a reasonable price, then stop by.

Oh, AND they have the best Horchata I've ever had.  I order Horchata from every Mexican restaurant I go to, and somehow, they just do it better: not too sweet, not too cinnamon-y...

I have been to bigger sit-down Mexican restaurants with a more complete menu, but as far as fast food Mexican goes, this is as good as it gets en mi opinión..."}
{"text":"I'm not sure this place is completely deserving of a 5 satr rating, so let me explain my position. Basically, in my \"zone,\" you have a few fast-food like Mexican joints to choose from: Filibertos (Indian Bend), Federico's (100th St & Frank Lloyd Wright), Habeneros (Hayden & Raintree), Cafe Rio (FLW & Pima) and this place. The winner... By far it's Senor Taco! Portions are very generous, place is clean, service is very friendly, food is fresh, and prices are beyond resonable. They give you chips with your order, and there's a salsa bar too. I have tried the shrimp burrito (fabulous), ham and cheese quesedilla, and a few other items in the two times I've eaten here. I'll be back many times more. Yeah... I REALLY like this place!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this location and I really liked it! If you haven't been to Senor Taco before, they serve up Mexican food (tacos, burritos, quesadillas) via their drive through or walk up counter.

The food has a leaning towards \"quantity\" but not at the expense of \"quality\", if you define quality as taste and appeal (I would be surprised if they used grass-fed beef or if their chickens were raised cage-free). There aren't any surprises on this menu; it is standard Mexican comfort food. You leave feeling warm and full!

I tried their homemade salsas and guac today- all were delicious and clearly not poured from a jar. I ordered three rolled tacos with cheese, for under $3, and was completely full by the end. In the past I've tried their burritos...I'm proud (or maybe not so proud) to say that I've eaten one of their full burritos in a single sitting, but you get the point: their portions are big, inexpensive, and yummy.

I would definitely return to this location when I'm looking for something quick and filling that's not mass-produced."}
{"text":"Vibes are not great to say the least. Some of the employees who I've seen habitually throughout the years need to check themselves at the door. Throwing in simple things like plastic forks when I'm on the go. Or simply asking what kind of salsa I want go very far with me. With all that being said my order has been screwed up on many occasions. I'm not asking for 5 star dinning service but small petty things like this that happen all the time really grind my gears..and being polite to. I highly recommend you find a new & friendlier Mexican Restaurant because this just simply is NOT worth it folks. Have a great day."}
{"text":"So good!  Price not bad either.  Haven't found anything I didn't like yet.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I ordered the carne asada burrito, and the carne was tough and gristly. Half of the burrito is going down the garbage disposal. On a positive note, the refried beans were pretty good."}
{"text":"Always so good and so fresh.  Takes a little longer because they make it when you order it.  Keep up the great job.  They take pride in their food."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for the fast Mexican /drive through style restaurant. I haven't tried everything yet so cannot give 5 stars but its about there.

The carnitas are a must (can put them it pretty much any form, on fries, in burritos, in tortas etc). Beans are good and fish tacos are better than rubios. They give you plenty of food here for the money. One odd thing is they do not have any adovada type meat. They have several mexican drinks (horchata, bottled meixcan sodas, etc)

Salsa bar is definitely more authentic mexican style (so my mexican wife says). Nice variety with Red, Diablo (should be hotter with that name), green, chile/oil, carrots, roasted chiles. 

For south Chandler this is the best place i have tried so far in this genre."}
{"text":"Great value, excellent food, mediocre service.  Don't expect the staff to go out of their way to make you feel like a valued customer, but Senor Taco is a great casual stop-in when you crave simply made, but very tasty Mexican food!  I don't know how they do it, but, from their fish tacos to their tostadas, their rolled tacos to their authentic chilaquiles and their limited salsa bar with spicy carrots on tap, all the food at Senor Taco is very good and made with honestly fresh ingredients at a price that won't sink your wallet-ship!  Nice menu selection...something for all tastes.  Overall, a far better value than the many generic 'bertos eateries (Filibertos, Erikbertos, Polibertos, Losbertos, etc) in the area.  Inside seating is a bit cramped, but they have a nice covered patio area that lets you unwind while you eat.  Solid 4 out of 5!"}
{"text":"The Burritos are really what you want to get here. They are top notch, incredibly delicious, especially the Surf & Turf which has shrimp, a white sauce and steak. 

They USED to have very good prices, 5 bucks got you the burrito a-la-carte but now it's $7.95. Most of the people who work here are very friendly but there was one girl who worked here for awhile who definitely was not. She gave me the wrong change one time and when I asked for the correct change she threw a fit and literally tossed my coins at me. After that each time I would go in she'd give me a strange attitude, including one time when I was watching something on the TV (I was the only one in there) and she purposely changed the channel then looked at me and smirked. Not cool!

I've been to the one in Scottsdale, it's MUCH better in my opinion. Either way, I can't deny how delicious their food is..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a breakfast burrito. eggs, sausage, cheese and hash browns is a hearty breakfast and its huge and cheap."}
{"text":"I agree, surf and turf Burrito is excellent. We love this place, my kids like the carne asada fries. I also recommend the shrimp cevichi tostadas. Everything we have tried we really liked. Clean, friendly and quick. Can't go wrong with Senor Taco!"}
{"text":"You have to try their diablo sauce! I always go there mostly for just that sometimes but their burritos, tostadas and enchiladas are pretty good and reasonably priced! The hotsauce alone is worth the trip. Great mexican spot."}
{"text":"It took them like two hours to get our meal and it wasn't even good I sucked I wont be going here again"}
{"text":"I was in search for a convenient Mexican food restaurant that serves not only quality food, but provides exceptional service. Alas, I found it. Although I only get delivery, I know when I get the food it's nice and hot, and ready to be devoured.

As I fill my belly with this delicious food, I remember the days of lore and remind myself of all the times I've gotten crappy food form subpar places.

I've found my happy place and I give 5 fingers and 5 toes up!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Huge burritos and quesadillas.. We can eat for around 10 bucks, and only because I order my bean and cheese burrito deep fried, so they add 2.00 for that 
, but it also comes with sour cream and guacamole. Don't care much for the chips- they don't taste good, Also bummed that they discontinued the whole grain tortillas, but we can deal. Service has always been very nice. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burrito and Horchata. The Senor burrito was huge! Enough for lunch and dinner or can easily feed two people."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4.5 stars. I tried the fish tacos, carne asada tacos and shredded chicken burrito. The fish tacos were delicious, but the carne asada tacos and shredded chicken burrito were just good. I would still definitely recommend this place to other people and I would come back again. The prices are decent and the food was good, so win, win."}
{"text":"I love señor taco. The one on the west side, in surprise. 

This one isn't quite as good. The salsas at the salsa bar were missing spoons and tongs. Some of the choices were never refilled and empty. Such as the hot carrots and onions with serranos. 

I had tacos this time. One with shredded beef and one with shredded chicken. The beef was pretty good but I'd never order the chicken again. 

Also, the señor taco in surprise sprinkle Mexican cheese on the chips. I wish this one did. 

Anyway. I'll be back to try my favorite señor taco item, carne asada burrito!!"}
{"text":"This place just shot up to my favorite taco shop in all of Phoenix!  The carne asada is the best this state has to offer. Deliciosa!!  The salsas, though not as hot as I'd like, fantastic flavor. 

I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Consistently wonderful food!  Our favorite Mexican food anywhere and we have been all over the world.  Our kids come back to see us and Sr. Tacos is the first place they go.  Then they continue to talk about how they can hardly wait to come back.  Top your meal off with Churros.  OMG delicious.  There is nothing bad on the menu.  Authentic food, very clean and lovely staff always.  Love it."}
{"text":"I've been to the other location a couple of times and thought the food was decent and affordable. So I decided to check this one out. I wanted a wet chimichanga with rice and beans and it came to almost $16. I thought that price was ridiculous! I can go to the BEST Mexican food restaurants and pay less and get complimentary chips and salsa, which this place wants extra for. I cancelled my order and called Macayos for take out. I got all that I wanted and saved a few bucks. Not going to go back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Foot is great. I usually get the California Surfing Burrito which is huge."}
{"text":"Wow!  Can't believe we haven't eaten here sooner.  Everyone loved what they ordered.  And to top it off...... BEST CHURROS I've EVER HAD!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is so amazing!!!food is on point. Best pastor tacos I've ever had..The cleaness of this place is great. The customer service is very friendly love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Busy place for lunch on a weekday.  Try the rice milk with your meal if you're a chai tea lover!"}
{"text":"Food is decent but not fantastic. A bit pricey for what you get. They have the worst drive through ever. SO SLOW!!! waited for 10 minutes with only one car in front of me. ridiculous! will not return to this location. There is a filibertos half a block south and  across the street and while it doesn't offer drive through, the service is actually faster and the food is better!"}
{"text":"my favorite mexican fast food place in Glendale area. Surf n Turf burrito and fish taco combo for 6.99 is amazing deal. the salsa bar is also unique and very flavorful."}
{"text":"Quality fast food. Huge menu, good ingredients. Shrimp burritos are loaded with nice sized shrimp. Drive through can be busy. Look up their menu then call in your order and pickup inside."}
{"text":"I was really craving Rubio's new shrimp tacos but for some odd reason, they were \"closed until further notice.\" Needless to say, I was pretty bummed out. But I drove down a few streets because my boyfriend wanted Hot Bagel and I remembered Señor Taco! So I decided to give it a try. The place was pretty empty. I got the Surf & Turf, which included a shrimp and beef burrito and a fish taco for only $6.99 (only available at this location). I had a pretty good amount of food for cheap. I haven't gotten sick off of it yet, so I'm going to say that I will be going back to this place! Now I'm glad Rubio's was closed because I got to try Señor Taco!"}
{"text":"whenever i'm experiencing a serious hunger in east mesa, senor taco is one of the first places that comes to mind. their burritos are huge and fresh tasting. the service is always quick and the salsa bar is A+"}
{"text":"Stopped by on my way to work to get something to eat for dinner on Cinco de Mayo.  I was extremely disappointed.  My food was cold when I got it - the cheese wasn't even melted in my cheese enchiladas.  I had to microwave it for a minute to get it nice and melty.  The beans were good, but only after reheated and the rice was weird.  It had really large chunks of carrots in it, something I've never experienced in all my Mexican food eating.

Not sure I will be eating here in the future."}
{"text":"Attending a local attraction, family was hungry for some quick and good food. Discussed the usual eateries and national food chain type restaurant we typically attend. I did a quick search on yelp of the area and the reviews helped point us toward this establishment. We were not disappointed, great food, quick service and great menu. Ordered different items and each one was prepared to our taste. Atmosphere had the feel of a family owned environment and the theme flowed throughout the food and on to our table. Our plates emptied and stomachs full we thank the staff and enjoyed the rest of the evening with another wonderful decision thanks to yelpers reviews! Great choice."}
{"text":"Pretty dank that's all you need to know

blaze and eat"}
{"text":"Super bomb, I'm from San diego California so I would know good Mexican food when I see and eat it. California Burrito(with Carne Asada) is dank as fuck. Also the Green salsa and red salsa is excellent."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place is rated 4 stars. They have bad customer service not to mention that there food has no flavor. My friends and I went to Señor Taco around 10:00pm when we walked in threw the door we asked how late they were open till the gentleman at the register told us till mid night, so we took our time looking over the menu since it was our first time there we wanted to see all that they had to offer. When we started to order the guy gave us attitude every time we asked a question as to what certain food had in it. When we finally got our food we noticed they didn't add what we had asked for so we let the guy know and he seemed annoyed at the fact we notice it didn't have what we asked for. When we finished our food we sat around just talking it was 5min till 11 we figure we were ok because the guy had mentioned they didn't close till 12 all of a sudden they shut the lights off so we got up and walked out as soon as we did the same guy came and locked the door right behind us. He could have told us hey we will be closing in 5min instead of turning the lights off. Definitely will never comeback. If I could I wouldn't even give it one star."}
{"text":"Disappointing today. The fish tacos have been cooked to the point that the fish was hard. Last visit we had one over cooked fish taco but the others were OK. I hope it's not going down hill"}
{"text":"This is a great place, with a lot of good choices. You will deifnately get your fill here for your money. I think the previous reviewer got the rolled tacos, and they have traditional tacos as well which I have gotten a few times. Their shrimp burrito is very tasty and has a lot of flavors going on. Its always busy, which is a good sign.... I would opt for take out, because they are rather small."}
{"text":"This is always a great stop and my family is happy with everything they order on every visit. I guess I'm the only one out of luck when ordering here. Nine times out of ten I order the carne asada burrito with RED CHILE. Unfortunately I only get that red chile about half the time I order it. Most of my orders are to go and when on the run, I don't really have much time to stop and unroll the burrito to check for that red chile but believe me, that red chile is so damn good. Not sure if the red chile button is broken but I make a point when ordering to say \"RED CHILE\". After my order is complete I even ask about the red chile to confirm and they assure me there's red chile. Before I leave I ask if the red chile is in there and they say, yes the red chile is in the burrito. Maybe red chile should just be offered on the side so we can put in the red chile ourselves. I don't know but something has to be done about the red chile."}
{"text":"I love, love, love, love, love this place!!! I eat here at least once a week, today I had the surf and turf burrito.....you HAVE TO TRY IT!  The staff is always polite and attentive, food always awesome, clean and well maintained a definite must try for every Mexican food lover."}
{"text":"Great constant delicious food. Their carne asada fries are amazing! Breakfast or Lunch menu has great food with their fresh made Horchata to top it off."}
{"text":"One of the best taco spots around we have never had any complaints or anything bad from Senor Taco and somehow me and my wife always see a local hero firefighters enjoying some tacos every time we go"}
{"text":"Wow!!!!! This place is amazing! Our new favorite taco shop. Our first time here and sure won't be our last!

Excellent service. Awesome selection on meals. Super clean. 

This restaurant is off to a fantastic start! Glad you're here."}
{"text":"Nothing special. I had rolled tacos and they were like filibertos... The horchata was alright, doesn't taste the best but it's drinkable."}
{"text":"We have been here a total of 5 times now two dinning in and three times drive through the first two dinning experiences were fine but whom ever runs the drive through has mess up our order three times in a row the first two times we got all the way home before noticing the order was completely messed up the third time my wife waited 12 minutes for her order to be corrected mind you we have a bunch of other food in the car getting cold. Wife wife pointed this out and the lady just shrugged it off. Granted we are spending between 40-50 every time was eat here and they just can't get the order correct. Although the food is decent for east valley Mexican food but I can't keep wasting money to eat items we didn't order or cold food.. Truly unfortunate... Oh I forgot to mention after my wife waited for the correct order they brought out again a wrong order I can't believe it I'm just floored"}
{"text":"I got very sick after eating at this cheap Mexican place.  The food was tasty and the side salsas were nice but clearly not worth it for me."}
{"text":"I really dig their fish tacos... they're so yummy in my tummy especially on Friday's when it's a special. Oh and the cheese quesadilla is not made with american cheese but with the mexican white cheese, which is so much better! good eats."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a few years, so I figured it was time for a review.  I usually get rolled beef tacos with guac.  8 out of 10 times I go, the food is spot on, but the other 2 times, it seems a little \"off\". Like maybe the rolled tacos were deep fried too long or the meat was old or the oil needed changing.  That's my only criticism.   If they were more consistent, I'd give them 5 stars.

The salsa bar is really good and they even keep it stocked during breakfast hours.  Their breakfast deluxe burrito is enough to feed two people and if you slice up some of their grilled chiles on it, you'll be in heaven (with a hot mouth).

Another favorite is the Carne Asada Torta.  Not a lot of places can do homestyle Mexican food right, but Senor Taco has AWESOME Tortas.

The food is reasonably priced, the staff is always friendly and the dining area is always clean."}
{"text":"So far I have been here about 5 times. And everytime it's delicious,  I get the California surfin.. and wow. I recommend this over a lot of places. I'm so happy there is one close by. Their specials are good. And so far their food has been perfect. Mmmm"}
{"text":"So disappointed in this place. I always go to senior taco over other similar chains. The last couple of times I have gone through the drive thru it takes FOREVER! Today was it for me. We put in our order in the drive thru, there was a person who was in front of us. Waited 8 minutes before it was our turn. We pull up, wait, wait and continue to wait just to be greeted and pay. They had our order wrong, which it was not messed up to much as they had two burritos to give us and we only ordered one. So we paid for the one and then she shut the window and we didn't get our burrito. We waited and waited and my husband even got out of the car and knocked on the window. We finally had to go park and go in to get the burrito. Looks like it's Ramiro's for now on...."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something better than Filibertos, And Ferderico's... This is the place. I used to work at Safeway right across the street and I'd always come here! I love their food! If you're looking for bomb ass food, definitely come here. The workers are awesome! One girl always knew me and knew what I ordered (because I literally went there all the time). So friendly and down to earth! 
I love the atmosphere because you can literally just chill and eat great Mexican food. Not to mention, they totally aren't picky with their cheese. They will pile that stuff on like no other. This is my first review, and I was thinking of who I would review and this place came to mind! Love this place! I recommend their rolled tacos, and also the all the special's are good as well and come with plenty of food."}
{"text":"Señor Taco 2 is amazing!  We come here for breakfast at least twice a month.  The staff is always friendly and atmosphere is casual.  The breakfast items are quality and a good value.  Try the chillaquilles, que bueno!"}
{"text":"Outstanding \"fast\" mexican food.  The fish tacos are sublime!  Everyrhing is made to order, so drive thru may take longer than usual but so worth the wait.  Best breakfast burritos in town!  Plus its locally owned & operated - not a big chain!"}
{"text":"Came here and ordered the carne asada tacos and a bean burrito for my kids. My carne asada meat was flavorless and chewy! When I got home, I cut open the bean burrito for my kids to share and there was a dam hair in it, disgusting! That was my first and last time visiting this place, I seriously don't see how so many people like the food here!"}
{"text":"This place is not good, their tacos have no flavor, the salsas suck the whole thing is just bad"}
{"text":"Best taco shop in south Chandler.  Best carnitas for may, many miles.  Top notch service, friendly staff that will bring your order to your table and accomodate any special request.  When you see the prices you may be a little taken back.  It is not cheap, however I can't finish  two carnitas tacos. The portions are huge!  Good beans and rice and they have one of my favorite toppings for rolled tacos, cotija cheese.  The chilliquiles plate is masterful."}
{"text":"Two notches above filibertos or any of the 'bertos' fast food places. Same menu but a touch better ingredients. Salsa bar is very good and the place was tons cleaner than a bertos..good pricing too.

Will be back."}
{"text":"I get take-out from Senor Taco almost weekly. I have never had a bad meal. My favorites are the carnitas hard taco, fish taco, and shrimp burrito. Oh and the cheese enchilada is also wonderful and the chili rellenos are one of the best I have ever had. Although, one time I got the chili relleno and it was just so so. I think you need to eat it there.  You must ask for the roasted chili oil from their salsa bar it makes everything more Fabulous. Fountain Hills is very lucky to have two of these restaurants. However the one on Fountain Hills  Blvd seems a bit cleaner and maybe even a bit better than the one on Shea. I love that they have a drive-thru at both. When it comes to inexpensive take-out this is the best place in town."}
{"text":"This place seems to be one of those late night neighborhood places that everyone goes to as the place had a line of cars around the building . This being my first time here I decided to try out their claim to fame which seemed to be the tacos. Let me go on record as saying it is really hard to find a place that does this simple dish justice. Some offer cheap and over cooked pieces of meat as the filling while others offer corn tortillas so soggy they just fall apart in your hands. 

Not my idea of good eats!! Anyways after ordering a chicken and carne asada taco I headed home to try the food out. The chicken had a slightly charred flavor which was nice once I squeezed a little lime over it. The salsa they offer seemed to have no flavor at all. I would recommend keeping a bottle of your most liked brand near by. The carne asada taco was mostly disappointing as it suffered from lack of seasoning on the meat and a very soggy tortilla. 

Overall I would say my experience was split 40% good with the remaining 60% going towards a needs improvement. The lack of seasoning from dish to dish shows they are not consistent with the product they put out. Soggy tortillas and flavorless salsa means they need to focus more on the details as this is usually the thing that separates the good from the bad. While this is not the worst place in the world I will not be going back for a while."}
{"text":"So here I am driving around in a strange town looking for something to eat.  Usually this doesn't end well. Not knowing where to eat I checked Yelp on my phone and it guided me to Senor Taco.
 We pulled into the drive trough and the menu was huge. after a quick study I ordered the 5 rolled fish tacos, 5 rolled beef tacos, 2 sides of beans and 2 sides of rice. All of this was under $20. service was quick and we were on our way.  When we got back and set it out there was a lot of food and a butt load of salsa. This was plenty of food for 3 of us we even had leftovers. The food was great for quick Mexican food.
 Next time I'm in Mesa i will be stopping by Senor Taco good stuff man."}
{"text":"We've been here for lunch and breakfast burritos. Have loved both and are always popping in for more breakfast burritos when time permits."}
{"text":"Great place, love the shredded beef crunchy tacos, bean and cheese burritos, rice are on our regular order, but always try something new and so far never disappointed. Drive-through takes a long time, but since I love the food, I just plan on it."}
{"text":"Best Mexican fast-food in the North Scottsdale area!  The prices are fair, but you get A LOT of food. We usually have some to take home every time, sometimes even half the meal. The value you get for what you pay cannot be beat. More importantly - the food is VERY yummy. The service is also good, the girls at the counter are always very friendly and accommodating. For quick Mexican food, this place cannot be beat by Filiberto's or Habanero's. Quite possibly the perfect fast-food Mexi place. I recommend the Grande breakfast burrito (possibly the best breakfast burro we have ever had), the California, the Surf 'N Turf (its a little messy though) burro, the hard tacos, the rolled tacos, the quesadillas. Also HIGHLY recommend the flautas - you basically get a decent sized chimi for $3. Its an awesome deal. Compare this place to Habanero's - which is overpriced, serves less on each plate, and tends to overcook their meats. No comparison. I'm pretty picky about Mexican food, because it is so easily either generic or overdone - but Senor Taco finds a perfect middle balance of simple Sonoran foods that are perfectly prepared and served. This is definitely our new go-to place when we need to fill up, be quick, and not spend a lot of $."}
{"text":"I love this place. I live down the street and have been going here for a year! Amazing salsa bar. The red medium is amazing. Pretty much everything on their menu kicks ass and you cannot go wrong ! I love their amazing burritos and carne asada fries. Get the burro burrito its a huge ass thing feeds 2 you can't go wrong only 9 bucks!!!!!! Enchilada plate is good to. Try them out very tasty and authentic !! Wish they were open 24/7 for those late night food runs lol"}
{"text":"Pretty good but I really like this new location!  I keep weird hours and I wish they were open 24hrs but its Fountain Hills. Not a lot stays open super late here."}
{"text":"Was not a big fan of how they make their meals. And beef tastes like it was over cooked and was still saturated in grease."}
{"text":"Senor Taco is delicious. The chicken chipotle burrito is my favorite. The tacos are great as well. It is a bit pricey,  but most of the time I don't mind paying for it."}
{"text":"If you're going to try anything here, I recommend the Hash Brown Burrito! Hands down best thing on the menu! Doesn't matter if its breakfast, lunch or dinner this is always my go to! I've been going to the FH location for 12 years now, just tried the sun city location and now just discovered this location is right down the street from me! I see a lot more hash brown burritos in my future! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Homemade flour tortillas. You get a lot for what you pay for. Prices are reasonable. Their chorizo plate and carnita plate are delicious and very lean, not fatty nor greasy. Love this place."}
{"text":"I'm super glad there is another great taco shop in the airpark! I went on a Tuesday when they have a $5 lunch combo special. That stuff is an awesome price and a lot of food. I also got a bean, rice, and cheese burrito just so I could try it. It was really good too. They have really yummy tortillas, they are as good as they look. I'd recommend not trying all that food in one sitting like I did, but instead visit the place a few times if you need to try all the things. If you're like me you'll get too full from all that food. 

Anyways, I can't wait to go back and get too full again!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite causal Mexican places in Arizona! Get the Diablo Shrimp Burrito, carnitas or carne asada fries. Very good quality and flavor. Not to mention you get tons of food for your buck. You'll walk out of here with a food baby. Wish we had a Mexican place like this near me in New Jersey!"}
{"text":"This drive through is better then most, they make the beans with lard and it tastes...feels authentic-ish. I'm told it's not by Mexican food snobs who have sweet little Mexican grandmothers \"who make it better\"."}
{"text":"I'm a picky eater with almost all my foods, I just wanted a bean beef and cheese burrito. My girlfriend asked if there's onions and peppers in it the girl at the register assured us that there was not. My burrito was ordered and my girlfriend had ordered a carne asada burrito and we left. 

After arriving home I open the box and there's a few soggy chips in there, I take a bite and it's riddled with peppers and onions. After a 4 hour drive home, and stopping for a quick food pickup on my way the last thing I wanted to do was get in my car and go back so I tried picking it all out, I soon gave up. My girlfriend was far from impressed by her burrito too.  

So I think with this being a $16 waste of money that makes us one time customers. Unfortunately."}
{"text":"We went here three times in the last 6 months, each time hoping it would be better and more like the location on Indian School and Dysart where we had previously visited. It wasn't. I got a combo platter each time and each time parts of the plate were literally unedible. The tamale was overcooked to death. The chile rellano had nothing in it and was dried out. And for over $8, it should be much better than that.
The last time my husband complained of an upset stomach that night and next day. We will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Yum!!! We eat a lot of Mexican food and this is by far my favorite on the west side. The chicken chimichanga is amazing. I crave it. I will be back many times. Nice service too!!"}
{"text":"I came from Southern California, so I have different expectations for Mexican Fast Food.

Senor Taco is likely the best I have had.  The beans are haunting.  Tortillas good.  Shrimp burrito is excellente.  Chicken burrito is great.  It goes on and on.  

Great salsa bar, but could be a bit hot for someone from the Midwest.

This place blows away Nando's and any other Mexican restaurant in the East valley, except Tia Rosa's."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to stop by the restaurant for the second time during my stay in the area. I stuck it out with my usual crane asada tacos, grabbed a couple churros and a cheese quesadilla. 

Having this order a second time, the tacos are larger than what I saw in Pasadena and are worth every penny, especially with the guacamole included in the price. The only downside was with my late visit this time around they had run out of green salsa for the day. This was at 11:15PM at night.

The churros were a sweet bonus and I may have missed the description on the menu but they were filled with Carmel inside. These tasted so much better than the ones I had at Redondo Beach two days prior. 

The quesadilla was as expected and par for the course.

All in all, this is a restaurant that's a great value for traditional versus Tex-Mex. This is especially the case considering this meal will cost only 60% compared to the chains. Don't be fooled however, the wait in the drive thru is equally long compared to ordering inside. And missing out on the salsa bar makes it worth the walk inside."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!!!! My wife and I usually go to the one on power and mckellips. Its all about the beef rolled tacos, the guac, and the tomatillo salsa! You'll be seeing me again!"}
{"text":"This was our first time coming to Senor Tacos and Oh my goodness was it delicious my hubby had a shrimp burrito and rolled fish tacos and loved them.  Food tasted fresh and delicious.  And they have a salsa bar."}
{"text":"I love this place. I was just expecting it to be another Filibertos type Mexican joint but it's a lot better. My favorite is the red chili burrito enchilada style. Trust me you will not leave hungry. Good portions and great taste. I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"First I do like everything I have ordered. I've been going here for about 5 months now at least 2x a month for lunch or dinner.   They do take a while to get your order to you, but to my understanding they cook everything to order so it's super fresh.  I have dined in on two separate occasions and they focus more on the drive thru then the sit down customers, which is very frustrating especially when you are on a time crunch for lunch.  So I would recommend going fine in only when you have time to spare.  The staff is not always the friendliest and the atmosphere is cold. That is why I would only suggest take out. But the quality of the food and the taste are great."}
{"text":"Finally another Señor Taco closer to home! Clean restaurant, fantastic salsa bar (be aware, even the mild salsa has a kick to it, and even hot salsas in the grocery store are too mild for my tastes), and fabulous food. Make sure to check out the five dollar specials. Five rolled tacos and a small drink for five bucks, can't go wrong. 

Staff is nothing but friendly and the good is terrific! The only drawback? I can't find the margaritas. Have to go to Fountain Hills for them."}
{"text":"This is a new place that opened.  
The staff are friendly and ready to feed you.  
The place is tidy and is a great joint to get your Mexican cravings met.  Can't wait to eat again."}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood Mexican food place. Flavorful and always good, I bring my dog and eat outside."}
{"text":"I usually wait to review a restaurant until I have visited at least two, if not three times. The major exception to this rule is if I don't plan to visit again.

I gave them two instead of one star because I had been suffering from stomach flu for a week, and mistakenly chose this restaurant to break my fast. What I'm saying is that they might have good stuff, but I won't be going back to find out.

I ordered the five tacos, a good deal at $4.95 I think. Unfortunately, they were deep fried taquitos, not traditional Mexican tacos. I liked the cheese, guac, and lettuce that was piled high, but unfortunately I didn't like what it was piled on top of."}
{"text":"I started with the specials on the board that include a drink.  I eased in with the familiar rolled tacos, crispy - topped with white cheese, guacamole, and crisp lettuce.  Moved up to a Mixed (meat and beans) burrito,  both chicken and beef options were tasteful and filling.  Then I ventured off the side board menu to al a carte and other combos....  The surf and turf.... steak and shrimp, hit the spot.  The fish tacos, fresh and flavorful.  The Diablo shrimp burrito was nice and spicy, and the regular shrimp burrito cool with pico and white sauce, each comes packed with tons of shrimp.  The Nachos with carne asada, better than anything that claims to be \"Super\".  The tostada somehow stays crunchy for over 45 minutes, with a generous spread of beans and toppings.  The quesadilla is different than the typical folded in half item.  There is no shortage of cheese in it, but some do not like the greasiness.  How could I not mention the beans, so good.

The salsa bar is great, we prefer the green and the \"mild\" red.  Also available on the self serve salsa bar: spicy salsa, slivered peppers and onions, and the spicy carrots, onions, and garlic mixture.  Small bags and to-go condiment cups with lids are available.

They have a drive thru available which is really nice when you don't want to get out of the car.  As this is not a fast-food restaurant, sometimes the drive thru can get backed up.  I certainly appreciate having the option though!

I've been coming here for over 4 years on a regular basis.  I cannot remember a single order where I was upset with the food or quality.

Skip the Bell, and say Hola to Senor Taco!"}
{"text":"Good fast food. Best drive through eats in the hills.  Surf n turf burrito and fish tacos are greAt.   Carnitas too."}
{"text":"The girls up front are great girls too! They always tease and joke with us.  We always ask for a Spanish lesson too!  Awesome place, great fresh food, and friendly service."}
{"text":"my dad & his wife wanted 2 go 2 this place 4 dinner so i took them. they seems 2 rave about this place but i wasnt impressed at all. my dad & i both had 2 fish rolled up tacos & a shrimp burrito. i like my fish tacos better grilled & in a soft corn shell, not fried. the shrimp burrito didnt have that much flavor 2 it. it was just 2 much tortilla & i dont like that at all. my dads wife had some beef tacos & she seemed 2 like them. ive  definitely had better mexican food than this!"}
{"text":"Yuck. Tastes like it is from the kitchen of an immigrate who can only afford Walmart cans of processed ingredients that have been refrozen a dozen times. Better food at Taco Bell, and cheaper."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Mesa to visit family, I try to stop here, even if its only for next day leftovers.  Everyone's very friendly and will make your food to order and correctly every time.  They also have really great deals each week that are super inexpensive, yet filling and delicious.  (somewhere around $4 for food and beverage depending on the week).  Food is awesome yet affordable and they are so fast on getting it out to you."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always have tacos! The very few and  the only bad reviews I have seen were for breakfast or something other than tacos. I can't say  anything about the other food. The dinner comes with rice and beans and those are good. I am so addicted to the green tomatillo sauce, I purchased extra to take home. Our family loves it!"}
{"text":"Had the shrimp and fish taco, by far the best if you are looking for traditional real Mexican food, it taste just like you would eat in a food truck, amazing!! Taste better than Rubios and Chipotle coming back for some more!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  This was quite bland for Mexican food and I was so disappointed.  I got a carnitas, carne asada & pollo taco and none of them warranted more than a couple of stars.

Also, my grandfather had the fish taco and it was very \"crispy.\" And by crispy I mean burnt to a barely edible level.

I'd recommend another joint."}
{"text":"We were shopping at Lowe's and needed lunch and found Señor Taco in the same parking lot. I wasn't excited for another 'berto experience but it was convenient enough. The wife got carne asada fries and I got the California Surfing burrito (surf and turf) because of the mentions of it in the Yelp reviews. Holy wow, was it delicious, and way to big, even for this big appetite. Very tasty combination with quality fresh shrimp, carne asada, guac and a chipotle sauce. Oh and fries! Yup, there were fries in it too and they were a great addition. Señor Taco isn't close to my home in the Tuke, but we'll be back to try more dishes. 
Ps, the wife's carne asada fries were really good too. Huge portion that required a to go box."}
{"text":"First time here, and impressed that they opened a second restaurant in our small town where restaurants have a hard time surviving--but now I know why! We had the shrimp soft tacos, fajita-style quesadilla (carne asada--steak) and a carnitas (pork) red chile burrito, enchilada-style all for about $22 after a 10% coupon from the local newspaper. Immediately the freshness of the food was apparent especially with the fresh green bell peppers, fantastic succulent shrimp, and nicely seasoned steak. The tortillas themselves tasted freshly-made. We used to go to Taco Hell when we needed a fast fix, but never again--for the same price you get high-def vs old B&W analog, more meat versus less junk-indiscernible filling, and what seems a lot more fresh versus a lot more frozen. Their salsas are worth filling up on, too! Two in particular: the green salsa verde had a generous amount garlic that made it quite nice and full-flavored, and an clear, oil-based one that had a very rich roasted and slightly smokey flavor that produced a nice growing hot sensation during the after-taste. The more you used, the warner your mouth got! My new favorite. The reason for the four versus five stars was the pork, although very generous and moist, to both me and my wife, tasted a bit too salty. Summary: this is the quality and freshness of Baja Fresh, and the quantity of Filibertos, and at a good price. Can't wait to go back and check out how they make chicken!"}
{"text":"Originally, I am from San Diego and so I know some really fantastic Baja style Mexican food when I taste it (not just see it).  Now, I know that I now live in the Sonoran Mexican food area and I won't find my beloved Baja style easily in this state.  But, let me just say this...after trying about 10 places around Phoenix, I have finally found a place that is almost as delicious as SD style food!  Their Machaca burritos actually have scrambled egg mixed in just like back home and it isn't as greasy as Sonoran style.  I've also tried their chicken taquitos and they use white meat, which is delicious.  Their salsa bar has some of the best salsa I've tried around here...it isn't as chunky as Baja style salsa, but it tastes a lot better than some of the runny stuff I've had at places such as Popo's in Phoenix.  And what was that?!  Yep!  They have one of my all-time favs from back home...hot carrots!  Not only do they have them, but they taste almost exactly the same way they do in San Diego.  

Okay okay, so I kept talking about food in San Diego...but honestly, it took my husband and I 5 years of living here to finally locate a place that has delicious and authentic food that is both Baja style and Sonoran style.  Love it!  Thank you Senor Taco for being here.  No, seriously."}
{"text":"THIS IS NO LONGER A SEÑOR TACO!!  It was replaced by sub par place. Not nearly as delicious!"}
{"text":"I had the taco special with one beef and one chicken, I liked the beef one, the chicken one did not have a lot of flavor.  I liked the rice and the beans were great.  I choose the green salsa over the red salsa.  I think next time I will go with beef rolled tacos with guacamole!"}
{"text":"Serving sizes are massive so order accordingly. It's the traditional Mexican style of tacos, guac etc. If you prefer American Mexican, you may not like it. I thought it was good. The cashier had zero personality but the owner came out at one point. He was very friendly and engaging. It's a good stop for tasty inexpensive food. Not sure I would crave it but I wouldn't mind eating here if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great food. Vast menu. Good salsa bar. Friendly. Huevos Rancheros and Breakfast Burritos are delicious. Flour tortillas are amazing."}
{"text":"I have had many items on there menu and they are all amazing and the flavor is always on point bit Literally the best bean and cheese burritos I have ever i kid you not it I love this place I use to drive 20 miles to the one is east Mesa I'm so glad they are popping up  you will never be disappointed with this place"}
{"text":"A LONG metal wire was found in my burrito. No Thanks. Never Again. I have never experienced this from senor taco before, however seeing an earlier post today (with a staple in someone's food), senor Taco has A LOT of work to do to make sure this never happens again. This is disgusting and unacceptable. Do better."}
{"text":"So, with many fond memories of the Señor Taco in Fountain Hills, we decided to come here Sunday night. 

We use to hit the FH location twice a month for a long time. But neither the food here, nor the prices are anything like the original. In fact, the food is barely m'eh, and expensive relative to their nearby competition.

If you are looking for fast casual, try America's Taco just a few miles south, or Habanero on the other side of the parking lot near Walmart's, or even Rubio's just a few hundred yards away.  If however you prefer sit down, try Los Olivos Norte virtually next door to Rubio's. 

Our dinner for three came to a pricey $35.31. We ordered the Carne Asada Burrito $8.99, the Shredded Beef Burrito $7.99, the Mimi Beef Chimi $8.99, a side order of 4 oz Guacamole and Chips $2.99. Of the three, only the Carne burrito was finished.  All of us didn't fair too well a few hours later. 

Sorry!"}
{"text":"They have good taco's (surprise!). Not fond at all of the regular chicken and beef ones but the specialty ones are pretty good. Not much else I've had so far has been that great."}
{"text":"What a great way to start the morning.  Food was hot, good and the service great. Many different choices and also have it your way which we did.  had the breakfast burrito with your choice of 4 items for around $4.50...  The food was so fresh we had to wait a few minutes to eat because it was so hot (not spicy).  Unlike Filibertos the food had lots of flavor...  Great place to eat..."}
{"text":"Would of been 5 stars but every time I come here the cashier always seems to have a stick stuck up somewhere up her. She is not ever friendly. Only reason for coming back is because the food is good."}
{"text":"We ordered for a 2nd time using UberEats and was very pleased.  Food arrived in a timely manner and still nice and warm.  

I had the Bean Tostada and it was perfect!  My husband had a Chili Rellenos Combo Plate and he was pleased with his serving size and the taste. 

We will use UberEats to deliver Senor Taco meals to us at home again soon!"}
{"text":"Love their taco salad!
Not the best atmosphere for eating inside but great place to pick up a to go order."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Out of all the Mexican places I've been, they have the best carne asada fries by far. It has big chunks of steak, good fries, good salsa, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and beans. Very fast service too."}
{"text":"I love the food because it reminds me of how I make my own tacos at home. The fresh chips and salsa bar is also a plus. The problem is that the prices a way to high for what is offered. If i wanted to pay that much for a taco platter I would go to a true sit down restaurant. This place is good for fast Mexican Restaurant style take out, but its too expensive to be an alternative to Taco Bell or Del Taco."}
{"text":"Moved to Arizona from Chicago and I got to say what a disappointment this place is.. expensive steak tacos and the tortilla was cold .. my search for great tacos in Arizona continues"}
{"text":"Great for that quick snack!!!  A fast food Mexican Restaurant sure to satisfying those evening cravings...  not all!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good 
But what happened to go customer service? 
They close at 10 it was around 9:40pm when the girl that was mopping was very rude I was finishing eating and she turned off the t.v that was rude than I went to throw my trash and she was about to throw my drink away like relax I'm leaving she was rushing me. For that reason I will never eat here again. If you don't know how to treat a customer find a different job."}
{"text":"Got a breakfast Burrito here, it was huge and tasty. I carried out so I cant speak for the facilities.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Clean dining room with a.friendly corpus courteous staff.

Food quality was good, but it was a bit on the bland side."}
{"text":"I had 2 fish tacos which looked good and my wife had a chicken taco and carnitas taco. Presentation was good, service was good, atmosphere was good. The tacos were not very good at all. They had no flavor or seasoning. The fish tacos were bland as were the carnitas and chicken tacos. I feel if they seasoned their meat a bit more it be a great place to get Mexican food. One may say why not add salsa to them, well sure but when cooking meat you always season it. The salsa compliments the taco. Anyways that's my 2 cents."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place today. It was so good! Carne asada was delicious and the pico de gallo was so fresh! The prices were not bad and we will def be back!"}
{"text":"They had some good food. We tried the bean burrito, shrimp tacos, chipotle burrito and chips and salsa. The bean and cheese burrito was good...but with only two ingredients, it's pretty easy to make delicious! They were pretty expensive for their worth. We spent $50, with Garcia's right next door...I almost wish we went there. I do like how they have a sign by the drive through window that says they take a bit longer to get the food out because they prepare everything fresh!!"}
{"text":"Seriously. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!! I love this hole in the wall. I first have to say that the girls who work the counter are so friendly and so SWEET!!!!!! The 5 dollar menu ROCKS!! O.k. seriously, please try the shrimp quesadilla is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!! Everything about this place rocks. BIG portions, filling, clean restaurant and friendly staff. If you haven't been, GO!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to live near a Senior Taco!  Unfortunately, it is not as good as the others I have been to.  It is clean and the staff is friendly.  Im still looking for a really great taco place."}
{"text":"Yay! First! Been going to senor taco in fountain hills and i didn't mind the 25 minute drive because they have the best carne Asada burrito in the valley. However i always wanted them to open one closer to home and they finally did!  It was pretty obvious they have not been open for long. Salsa was fresh,  and burro was delicious but the size was smaller than the ones in fountain hills. Right next to DD, I will be visiting here often :)"}
{"text":"Had the fish taco plate..ehh..decent for the price and amount. Nothing spectacular. Not sure if I will ever find a great Mexican food place around here"}
{"text":"Senor Taco has good food for a far price. The fish taco is excellent. There is a salsa bar with a variety of unique items. The salsa itself is good, but not great. The dining room is a bit worn down, but it is comfortable and quiet.

The service is a little below average, but not bad."}
{"text":"Have you met el Señor Taco? You will enjoy meeting el Señor Burritos and all the menu items as well. Just by the looks of it there was not much to expect until you realize you stepped into an authentic Mexican spot. The girls are attentive, and you can expect warm service. The menu selection is off the charts. I have a nag for ordering the wrong stuff. It's almost like a gift. So I can tell you although they put a lot of work in los Huevos Rancheros, it was not a favorite. But I saw people with the shrimp cocktail and quesadillas and they make it worthy to give it another try, but I did get the fish tacos and they were yum yum. Big pieces of fresh fish and very good sized. I also sampled the menudo, which I appreciated that courtesy very much and I tell you, it was tasty. So yeah, it was nice to meet  Mr. Taco."}
{"text":"So delicious!! Have been coming here for years and never have had something I didn't like. Service is fast and the salsa bar is heavenly :)"}
{"text":"Had the carnitas and fish tacos. Better than average. The salsa bar was unexpected and very good. Onions, peppers and carrots. Sauce for every taste. Clean with good service. I will be going back to try the other menu items. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Pretty good little Mexican food place. The portions are large, the service is fairly quick and the prices are fair.  I had the carne asada tacos and they were good. I saw someone order the carne asada fries and those looked good as well and massive in size. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Very good food for the price!  Quality food and a great salsa bar make this a great place for take out."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best beef Taco's I've ever had. The inside is always clean, the staff is very friendly. For the most part the food is served pretty quickly which is okay since you want to make sure it is cooked all the way. We go here at least once or twice a week. If you haven't been you should try it."}
{"text":"went for a breakfast burrito. IT was awesome.  I will defintely go back for more."}
{"text":"Excellent food at fair prices. I've lived in the valley for about 5 years and this place has the best horchata I've had in the city. I have yet to try the entire menu, but everything I've had has been phenominal."}
{"text":"I can't say it enough, this place is so dang yummy.  Portions are very good for the price.  Dishes are incredibly flavorful.  I try to get something different every time. The Diablo is crazy spicy. I had the shrimp burrito tonight and it was so goooood! I will be so mad if my next trip out here to see my mum...they close. And I will blame that hideous, god awful sign of Del Webb.  It is an eyesore & blocks it's visibility when heading west on Bell road."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Señor Taco and since I work a mile down the road, I thought I would have a new place to add into my lunch rotation. I was wrong. 

The cashier seemed annoyed that I was taking a while to review the menu. Well I've never been there before and wanted to make sure I checked out everything and despite being really hard to read. I even had my glasses on but found myself squinting to read the board, whomever designed that system wasn't using his thinking cap.  When I finally ordered, I asked for the two taco combo with chicken. I asked a couple questions regarding my order such as what's on tacos and wasn't really given a real answer. I asked if they had sour cream, instead of saying yes or no, I got a \"do you want sour cream?\" Nope! Then we moved on so I'm still not sure if there's normally sour cream or not.
I asked for flour tortillas but was given corn. I hate corn tortillas. So I ended up just dumping the contents of the tacos into my container and eating it like that. 

The customer service was horrific. The cashier kept pulling her pants up but was getting surprisingly low into her pants to accomplish her task of covering her midsection. No one looked clean and professional. I seriously worry about the cleanliness of the kitchen based on the staff. 

The only reason it's getting 2 stars instead of one. The chicken was fantastic."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito around! Get the crunchy breakfast burrito and you won't be disappointed! It's huge! With a creamy chipotle sauce. So good!"}
{"text":"came in from LA and was looking for some tacos and thought I'd give this spot a shot. the place is really clean and the guy working the counter seemed to be friendly. I felt the food was really over priced to start with, $3.50 for a taco isn't very appealing but I thought, ok, maybe it's a big taco. so I did order a taco and a shrimp burrito. first off, the shrimp burrito was great and is the reason for the 3 stars in my review. the shrimp was perfectly cooked and had a great sauce. the burrito was huge and was definitely worth the price. now, the taco was horrible, the Carne asada was extremely bland and the tortilla didn't even seem like it had been cooked, it was hard and flavorless as well. the taco was big but still over priced at 3.50. my recommendation would be not to waste your time with the tacos or anything with the Carne asada."}
{"text":"A little slow on getting the order ready but definitely worth it. Their Carne asada fries beat any Federicos and Humbertos."}
{"text":"This is hands down probably one of the best Mexican food spots I've had. I took myself wide and 2 kids and we ordered a shrimp burrito plate, a bean and cheese for my daughter, and carne asada plate for my self along with 3 rolled tacos. Everything we ate was delicious and you can tell it was homemade. Even the rice and beans were really good. Idk how i haven't been here before. We will definitely be back and we live all the way in San Tan Valley"}
{"text":"Kind of a cheaper version of Mexican food but in that area it was the only place we could find Mexican food closer to Tex Mex and we thought it was good. I would go again if I lived in that area."}
{"text":"This is the hole in the wall Mexican joint of my dreams. Good value, clean, a salsa bar and pretty good too.

The 1.99 fish tacos on special were quite large. The fish was decently crisp on the outside and tender on the insides. It was dressed nicly with the pico and salsas.

For a real kick try the roasted Serrano chilies at the salsa bar they are quite warm.

I salute you Senior Taco!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but the flies were unpleasant. We wanted some extra pico and they wanted me to pay for it. I spent $31 for 2 quesadillas and a fish burrito. I'm not paying extra for a little bit of pico. 
Probably not coming back."}
{"text":"Great food I had the enchilada and to make tamale combo. Service was really good. The food was very tasty. The refi beans are the best of ever had"}
{"text":"I've only been here once so far, but I do look forward to coming back! I need to test more of their food. It may take me days, if not weeks of grueling taste testing; )"}
{"text":"The best fast Mexican food in the Valley.  The food is delicious, service is perfect and the prices are fair.  Everything is made at the restaurant, by hand, including all the sauces.  I eat there several times a week.  Just right..."}
{"text":"The food is good. Typical Mesa AZ Mex good vibes. Nothing super unique but will instantly fill your mex cravings for a good price. Would give 4 stars, but they use styrofoam plates and plastic utensils even if you are dining in. Wish they would go with something more sustainable like paper plates and compostable utensils."}
{"text":"One item brings us back... Carne Asada fries, no one else in AZ makes Carne Asada fries that I know of (San Diego Mexican food staple) This place has them and plenty of them, good for 2 or more people.  Also the burritos and flautas (rolled tacos) are good. Good place for fast Mexican food."}
{"text":"Chili Verde is over the top....beans are full of flavor, homade tasting....the salsa bar is really good.....highly recommended"}
{"text":"For fast food Mexican you can't beat Senor Taco.  Love the surf & turf.  Huge portions, cheap prices, good quality."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I come here often, usually once a week. They have great lunch specials and I am always full after. The food isn't too greasy like some Mexican food places. The cashiers are always friendly and will bring my food to me. The salsa tastes great too! If you're up for some good, quick Mexican food I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"This place is terrific. Everything is fresh, the service is friendly and fast.

The carnitas tacos are some of the best I've had (and I've had a lot, being a San Diego native). They also have a great special deal on 3 taquitos + quesadilla. The cheese is fresh and flavorful.

I'm not a shrimp eater, but my wife loves the various shrimp dishes and she is very picky about them, so they must be good.

I would recommend this to my pickiest Mexican Food friends."}
{"text":"Immaculate bathrooms. Great GREAT Mexican food. My wife and I came after needing some Mexican food. We came on Sunday. Not very busy. Slow to get the food for a fast food resturant. The food was AMAZING. I had the green chilli burrito combo with rice and beans. My wife had quesadilla chicken. Both amazing. On our second visit I had the fajitas. Also amazing. Their beans are so wonderful. Everything we have had was seriously good. We have been at least 10 tomes since I started this review. Our go to place for Mexican food now."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast burritos.  I recommend the machaca. Very generous portions."}
{"text":"Very clean fast food restaurant. Salsa bar is full and great choices. I got the California Surfin Burrito with shrimp, potatoes, carne Asada  and some sauce that is excellent to bring it all together.
They are friendly here and have a drive thru If you don't feel like dining in. 
Give it a shot if your in the area!"}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has so many stars. My boy toy and I have been here twice now and neither time was great. It's just... Meh. Not horrible, but not great. I had the hash brown burrito the first time and he had the huevos rancheros. My burrito had nothing but a fried egg, a little but of hash browns.. And bacon. Then, my last 4 bites or so had sausage. No sour cream, pico, cheese... Very plain. His had the eggs with what was definitely canned enchilada sauce.. The refried beans were no better than the canned beans you an buy at the store. The second time we tried a fish taco and burrito... Same experience. The fish had no flavor and was overly fried. I think Los Favoritos close by is way better for a fast food Mexican!"}
{"text":"If you haven't eaten here you're bummin'. Big portions, cheap, clean, but most of all...delicious! Yum!"}
{"text":"We go here to get quick food sometimes. I had to write a good review because the food tastes good. The place is nothing fancy, but it reminds me of the local taco joints back home in the bay area. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Love sr taco!! They have a new location at southern and stapley in Mesa!! Super yummy food and good prices!"}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for New Mexican food in north Scottsdale. Welcome senior taco. Visited last week with my family. Overall, we enjoyed the meal.
It's a clean little Mexican joint tucked in next to dunkin. 

We started with chips and guac. The chips were good, the salsas were great, but the guac was subpar.

I had the chicken fajita burrito. It was good, but not great. A little greasy for my taste. The tortillas are super good.

The wifey had a taco salad which she though was good but had only small amounts of beans and guac. 

My little dude had a ham and cheese quesadilla, which he loved. 

It may be too early to judge after 1 visit, and I will be back for sure, but 4 stars seems right. If they step up their guac game this would be a 5 start joint for sure."}
{"text":"Love this go to spot for quick Mexican food.  Everything's we've tried has been very tasty!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and love this place! Great fish tacos, service, and very affordable!"}
{"text":"Nice people, but the food had absolutely no flavor.  How can this be with Mexican food??"}
{"text":"Not Fancy but Super Tasty!
This review is for breakfast.
We were hungry and didn't want a pricey sit-down breakfast that might take a while, so we found Senor Taco on our way to the Talking Stick Golf Course.
I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and the hubby had the Chorizo Breakfast Burrito.
Both were big portions. I honestly can't believe my husband ate that whole burrito. I didn't even get a bite.  I was too busy diving into my perfectly cooked over easy eggs and ranchero sauce.  Yum!  
I would totally go back here again for breakfast or whatever dining occasion.
Again... not fancy.... you walk up to the counter and order.  It reminded me of Roberto's, and the food was simple but flavorful.  Service was nice and quick. 
Our breakfast with 1 coffee (I had water) was $18."}
{"text":"Okay so we've been back here a bunch more times, and have not been impressed. It feels like everything besides the carne asada fries/nachos is mediocre.

Yesterday my wife got a beef taco and she said it was bland. We opened it up and I can't even tell you what was inside. It's like someone took some kind of shredded or boiled beef and like smooshed and shit out of it until it was like a paste or something and then smashed it into a sort of patty and grilled it? It was like burnt around the edges and conformed to the shape of the taco shell. I've had a lot of beef tacos in my day, and usually it's like chunks of shredded beef or ground beef - not whatever the fuck this was.

Anyway besides that nothing's really bad it's just everything's kind of average, which is why I'm reducing it to 3 stars. I wouldn't get a beef taco here again, though."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Thursday night. Not particularly busy. Ordered the #1 combo.  Tamale tasted old. Beans were gray colored. Tortilla in my enchilada was stale.  The whole plate was covered in a flavorless white melted cheese.  I trudged through my plate eating what I could.  The salsa bar had stuff in it that looked several days old.  The salsa has temperature issues. Seems like it should be kept cold...it isn't. The cashier was seemed to be annoyed that we took a minute or two to look at the menu before ordering, this was our first time here.  There was no one behind us.  While I was ordering, she was also taking an order on her drive thru headset. Impressive, I guess, that she didn't mix up the orders, but rude.  Come here if you want bad food and bad service.  You'll feel sick afterward."}
{"text":"Very, very surprised! Been driving by this place for a while now. Have been hesitant to try it. So on our way back from our foster kids therapy. We decided to stop by on our way home. I had the carne asada soft tacos. First they are large, and very good. I also had a bite of Natalies chile verde burrito. I liked it because it also had beans in it. All five kids really enjoyed their dinner. Wife had the cheese enchiladas, and said it was worth coming back for. 
The only down side at this place is their decor is worn and dated. Needs to be updated. But this place is well worth it. Glad we tried it, and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and came on my sisters recommendation.  She always gets the rolled tacos but I ventured out and got the Ceviche tostada and the shrimp colichi.  Both were amazingly fresh and fantastic flavor. I have never tasted anything like the creamy sauce on the shrimp and they were perfectly cooked.  Would highly recommend and will be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly service, food is awesome.  This location opened a few weeks ago and has been packed ever since.  Food has a lot of flavor and everyone I know who has eaten here loves it and comes back for more."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food in the valley.  A huge variety (I recommend the chilaquiles) of food and very reasonable prices.  Their Fountain Hills location got me started eating here and when they moved to Scottsdale I was ecstatic.  Very friendly staff and a great selection of spicy sauces."}
{"text":"Ever meal comes out fresh and piping hot. Great prices. The best Mexican food I've had. Have a great 5 dollar special menu.  You will not be sorry.

One of the only Mexican food restaurants that haven't been decreasing burrito size.

There are several locations in the valley now. I have noticed differences in quality between them. The one of McKellips and Power is by far the best."}
{"text":"Surf and turf burrito is AH-MAZING especially if you get it with the spicy chipotle sauce.  It's a 2-meal burrito.  The chicken enchiladas are also great.  Very friendly and helpful staff too."}
{"text":"First time to this restaurant. Not terribly impressed. 

Start with cleanliness. There were flies in the restaurant. The bathroom had not been cleaned. The rest of it looked okay for a small taco shop. There is only fast food restaurant type seating.

Service was good. The woman behind the counter was very good at explaining the food and give me some recommendations. She was courteous and nice.

The food is okay. Price to quantity was pretty good. But I would rather have less quantity and more quality. It was relatively bland food. The salsas were okay but they all kind of taste the same. I spent $13 on chips and two large flower tacos with beans and rice. 

This restaurant was just under okay."}
{"text":"Great food (my kids love it), very good service and the price is right for what you get - a lot of food !   We've been there twice already and both times were very good."}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered the three taco kids combo they're not tacos it's more like three really greasy deep-fried over deep-fried chimichangas! They did not give me any sauce and we waited approximately 15 minutes or more in line. I always say this but officially tonight will be my last night going to this location it's just not good food"}
{"text":"Food is good. My biggest complaint is the Hispanic lady at the front working the register. She has an outright nasty attitude. She is miserable at her job and she lets it show. I love how she ran her mouth about me in Spanish. She thought  I was gone since I ordered my food to go when in reality I was sitting in the booth around the corner out of sight. She was upset because I had placed a large order and had forgotten to tell her it was going to be paid in 3 separate ways. Not only did she give me a hard time she tried to lecture me about how to properly place an order through the phone."}
{"text":"Being from orange county California the Mexican food here can be very different for me and sometimes that's not a good thing. But this place is an amazing perfect blend of what I call Baja Mexican and Arizona Mexican even something as simple as their rolled tacos here is absolutely amazing cooked just the way I remember growing up. I seriously think I ate like a full cup of salsa every time I come here the best I get the hottest one and grilled peppers on the side amazing"}
{"text":"Awesome shrimp burrito! I get nothing else even though I try too. It's filled with big shrimp and the sauce with it is so good. When family comes out I always recommend going there."}
{"text":"I came here on my visit to Arizona and it was recommended to me by a family member. It was quite an interesting little place. I had their breakfast burrito with chips inside, carne asada fries, and a fish taco. 

I enjoyed the breakfast burrito very much, and for a little kick, they added chips inside the burrito for some much needed crunch. It had to right blend of textures in this dish with the standard delicious breakfast burrito taste. However, their carne asada fries was the real star of the meal. I've had many carne asada fries and I would say without a doubt that this was the best. The steak had such a good texture and a wonderful flavor, and the fries were not over cooked or under cooked, and they held up to the moisture of the dish pretty well. 

The reason I give it a 4 star instead of a 5 star was their fish taco. It had all the right flavors, but it did not come out crunchy at all. It was a disappointing moment because I love fish tacos.

P.S. You must try their red salsas. The mild one has a very bold flavor that makes it addicting with a nice kick of spice. If you want a more spicy version, just up for their spicy red sauce. You can feel the burn of that one in your mouth for a while."}
{"text":"This place is really good, they offer huge burritos at a very good price.  Their señor burrito is so big it needs two huge tortillas and its less than $8. It can feed 3 adults."}
{"text":"We have been getting drive thru from this place for last few years. The food is fantastic and they usually have daily combos.  The food is a bit pricey in my opinion but you do get your money's worth. This place is always packed  with business inside and in the drive thru line so expect a wait. We usually get to food to go because the restaurant itself isn't huge. I gave four stars because there can be a bit of a language barrier when ordering at window and plan to wait for ten minutes or more for fresh food preparation. Sometimes I have to repeat my order few times. However, they are always friendly and if you need a good Mexican place try this . You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Staff sucks always playing games really makes me not trust the food..... There is one lady every time I go there always rude I use to go there a few times a week but no longer...."}
{"text":"Outside will make u want to move on, don't this is excellent Mexican. On par with anything in the valley. Great portions fresh awesome salsa. Don't go out of your way but if you stuck in bell 101 traffic grab a burrito"}
{"text":"We really enjoy Senor Taco.  My husband always has the Carne Asada Burrito and for my daughter and I he gets two soft chicken tacos each.  I can't speak of his burrito except to say that he loves it and he is very particular when it comes to carne asada.  The really cool part of the chicken soft tacos is that with each taco they have two soft taco shells so whatever falls out falls in to the other shell so each taco is actually two!!!  But I have to say that our favorite part is the churros.  They are so fresh and delicious.  The best I have ever had."}
{"text":"I thought the all the salsa were just plain gross, the food is VERY greasy, and the cheese quesadilla had no flavor, it was like chewing on a big piece on gum."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast burritos!  I recommend the crunchy breakfast chipotle burrito!!   Always helpful staff and great prices for what you get"}
{"text":"I have lived both in Scottsdale and in Southern California, but I maintain that this is one of the most delicious, homemade Mexican food places that I have ever been to and may ever go to in the rest of my adult life.  The burritos are unbelievably authentic, as is the rest of the food, and while you won't find incredibly high-quality ingredients every single time, it will always be delicious and satisfying.  The tortillas are incredibly fresh and it's clear that they're homemade, and their refried beans taste like I'm back across the border.  If you're looking for some awesome, relatively cheap Mexican food, then look no further than Señor Taco.  Always a favorite, and great to come back to when you want some southwest comfort food."}
{"text":"I have been here so many times I don't know if I should be embarrassed or proud, this place is definitely one of my guilty pleasures. They have amazing afternoon prices, I believe after 3pm and if you work at one of the near by dealerships they give you a discount. You have to try their spicy oil on basically anything you order, it's a staple!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and the service is really solid!  The Carnitas Tacos are great.  I ordered the same dish basically at La Hacienda at the Fairmont Princess for $34 and Senor Taco destroyed them for $6.  I am excited to continue eating here and would highly recommend you give them a try.  I'm addicted!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened, but this place has  gone downhill over the last 6-8 months. Brown guacamole 2 weeks ago and this time all my tacos were undercooked.  I usually have to ask for salsa in the drive thru and they have a combo that they sell on the window for $6, but if you order it off the menu with a drink it's  $8.99. Yep, $3 for a drink. It often comes down to whomever is working the front. It's sad because I used to love this place for the food and value, but now it's not good for either."}
{"text":"Holy crap, how have I been in Arizona for 5 years and never been here?! Finally tried this place tonight and it was awesome. Just around the corner from our house. The burritos are amazing and huge for the price. I had the burrito with the shrimp and carne asada and the secret sauce is like a flavor explosion. Husband loved his carne asada burrito. The guacamole is perfect and not filled with a bunch of crap like onions and tomatoes. Definitely will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"For those looking for Good menudo in north Scottsdale, finally found some. Menudo EVERYDAY! 




Menudo"}
{"text":"Best Carne Asada burros on this side of town by far. Decided to give this place a try after an older Mexican co-worker told me they had good Mexican food and he liked Senor Taco a lot. I wasn't disappointed. The frijoles and tostadas lack flavor compared to some traditional places but the carne asada and pollo asado burritos are great. I haven't been able to find a good burrito since my years living in Westside Phoenix, and this place reminds me of one of the very few things I miss from that part of town, great Mexican food. If you think Taco Bell is great (like my wife from Michigan) this place isn't for you. I however, will be back soon."}
{"text":"I love their homemade horchata.  It's so good.

The menudo soup here is very good.  Better than most restaurants and they give you a much bigger portion.  Definitely homemade."}
{"text":"I've never been so disappointed. We ordered two chicken burritos, got home and found that there was a breakfast burrito and some mystery meat and onion burrito. we ate some of each, then brought them back for a credit or refund. No one spoke good enough english and they wouldn't do anything. Needless to say, they lost a customer who used to go there 3-4 times a month."}
{"text":"Yes this place is a little expensive but it's quality food but with that being said the food does take a little more time to get to you even if you do decide to go through the drive thru.  I ordered a cheese enchilada meal and a veggie burrito, which was a lot of food, but I knew that(; I really didn't like the cheese enchiladas or rice and beans that it came with it, the only thing I liked was that it came with sour cream mmmm. Filibertos doesn't add sour cream unless you ask for it haha but I do like their cheese enchiladas better. The veggie burrito I practically inhaled it was soooooo good, I will come back only for that burrito. The guacamole in it was delicious, everything about that burrito was delicious. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Great carnitas tacos. A lot of food though so next time I'll try the smaller street tacos. Sides were very good too. They were very nice and friendly, the place was nice and clean. We'll go back often."}
{"text":"Small. Place amazing food good prices. Verry filling! 5 tacos rolls where good.  Salas was nice"}
{"text":"Carne Asada French Fries, holy crap what an invention. Need more stores is my only advice!!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot for a quick vegetarian burrito! Don't forget the salsa & hot carrot bar, yum! This place is always clean, fast and has great food. I wish they had chips with their salsa bar."}
{"text":"Spanish omelet is De Lish! I've had it numerous times.... Always consistently yummy ! Friendly service as well. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"I had the California Surf Burrito, arguably the best burrito I have ever had. The restaurant was clean, the workers were friendly. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I don't usually review fast food joints, but....if you like Machaca, particularly a machaca breakfast burrito, this is the place to get one. Or three. The machaca is juicy and flavorful, and these guys don't skimp on the meat. Sure $8 (rounded, with tax) is a bit  pricy for a breakfast burro, but this is worth it. I highly encourage you to give it a try."}
{"text":"Definitely the best and freshest fast food Mexican place I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. My personal favorite is the chile verde burrito. My week is basically not complete until I have one. They have quite a lot of options on their menu, and they are all good. Senior Taco is a chain but they have franchises. We have met the owner of this franchise several times and you can definitely tell that he takes pride in his work and the restaurant. He always makes everyone feel welcome, and always checks on the customers. This is so nice to find in a fast food place. The interior is always clean, and well taken care. They have booths and tables, with a cute Mexican theme throughout the building. If you don't want to sit inside, they have a few tables outside. There is also a drive thru. The wait times are average, but this is because the food is made to order and fresh. The portions are huge, they are usually hard for me to finish. The prices are decent as well, considering the freshness and portion size. It's located I the Lowe's parking lot across from Hamilton high school. I love coming here and I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Had cheese enchilada and beef taco, better or good as any sit down Mexican restaurant.  Nice people. I'd skip the nachos, like Taco Bell nachos but bigger. But everything else is great."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoyed coming here. I had always drove past but never stopped in. This place is a simple and fast mexican food joint. I had the Fajitas and they were really good for being fast food. My wife had the carnitas and she really like them as well. If you are looking for some good mexican fast food without the typical greasy feeling, this place is worth a try!"}
{"text":"Was shopping down south and got hungry.  Went to yelp and found this gem.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed it.  Had the carnitas, which I liked better than the carne asada.  It's an intentionally dry carnitas.  Liked all 3 of their less hot sauces.  Employees were nice.  This place puts the hurt on all the 'bertos, esp. Fili.

Tip:  the churros have a red fruity filling.  Didn't know that going into it but it was a decent variation.  Warm and cinnamony."}
{"text":"While visiting the area I found Senor Tacos on yelp and decided to give it a go. Super yummy Mexican food in a setting comparitive to Rubios or Baja Fresh. Big menu, lots of choices at a reasonable price.
The salsa bar is yummy and while not huge, full of authentic taste! Great spot for a quick meal, or a cheap date!"}
{"text":"I only ordered a Horchata.  But the sign was really classless in my opinion.  Maybe ill give their food a try but this sign just really bugs me.  I dont like being proactively asked for tips."}
{"text":"The good and bad review! 
1st time here. Went inside to order, several tables filled with families. Appeared to be very clean with a salsa bar next to the soda machine. 
Welcomed by the gal at the counter to take my order. Order 2 shredded beef tacos with no tomatoes with rice, no beans. She read back my order, I paid and had a seat till ready. I chose take out as I was by myself. My total was $8 and some change. 

1st mistake, I drove away and didn't check my order. Ugh!!! Tacos look great with no tomatoes, but ALL flipped beans!!!! Yucky!!!  So $8 to two tacos was way overpriced and disappointing. The tacos were great. Will try again and will definitely verify my order before leaving."}
{"text":"So I was going back and forth of whether to give this place three or four stars. I think is deserved 3 and a half actually! 
Well, I had somewhat high expectations. When it's been a while since I've had fast food mexican it always sounds so good in my head and then I get it and think meh that was ok. I'd say my expectations were about met. Was just a tiny bit pricier than anticipated, but not bad! The salsa bar was cool, liked that they had some other stuff besides salsa. I tried the mild, Diablo, and tomatillo salsa. 
I went right after work at 6 pm on a Thursday and there was no line at all, only one family dining in. Was great because I got good fast service. I got a veggie burro combo meal with no sour cream. I always worry getting food to go that I'm going to get home and think no they messed up my order! But everything was how I asked. People working there did a good job.
Food was not the best fast food Mexican, but also not bad. Beans weren't amazing, but I enjoyed the rice. Thought the lettuce on the burrito got kinda hot and nasty as I ate it, but the rest was pretty good. A big burrito too! The meal filled me up for sure."}
{"text":"I've always loved their food. I frequent the power location often. However, every time I come to this location I have to order my food twice and half the time the order is not correct. On my last visit I ordered a simple breakfast burrito but the lady at the window tried to hand me a bag full of food for somebody else. I could've easily driven away with someone else's food. When I brought this matter to her attention all she did was remove the burrito from the bag and give me the burrito. Come to find out it was the wrong burrito. I feel the employees don't pay close enough attention to their task at hand. Two stars because when the order is correct the food is great."}
{"text":"Food is decent, customer service is terrible. This time I was overcharged by $3 for a la carte items that should have been a special combo. When I brought it to the cashier's attention her response was essentially \"tough\". They have officially lost my business."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite and most go-to Mexican place. It looks like a fast food restaurant, and though the food is fast, it's anything but that. Everything is fresh and made to order, the flavors and quality are unbeatable. I've been a weekly customer here for nearly 5 years and have no intentions of stopping. If you want some bliss, try the California Surfin' burrito, it's over the top!"}
{"text":"Takes forever to answer the phone then hangs up on you when you ask a simple question like \"what time do you close?\""}
{"text":"There is a couple Mexican food places in this area, however, this place is by far the best place out of all of them.  The taste and the portion defiantly gives you your money's worth.  The salsa bar is great, I wish they gave you some additional chips to go with the salsa.  The place is very reasonably priced, very clean, the ambiance is very neat for the size of the restaurant,  and the owner is a very nice gentleman."}
{"text":"My new favorite taco place. I ordered flour meat taco w rice and beans, fantastic. Food was excellent. People friendly, I will tell my family and friends about this place."}
{"text":"Ick. No clue how this place has 4 stars. It's greasy and just not good. At all. 
I had a carne asada burrito filled with the toughest, chewiest excuse for meat I've ever had. My daughter had some sort of breakfast burrito and she said the eggs were cold and tasted like they had been sitting for awhile in a tray. 
Do yourself a favor- hit up Taco Bell. Even that puts this dump to shame."}
{"text":"Worst ever 30 min to get 1 burrito, I order a Chile relleno with carne asada burrito I got a burrito full of cabbage in some wierd sauce. Senor taco usually is pretty good but not this one.  Worst $14.89 for a nasty burrito and a soda no thanks."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican places in Phoenix. Tacos, rolled tacos, burrito are usually my go to when I stop in. You will not be disappointed.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Wicked great burrito! Probably not heart-healthy, but what the heck. The carnitas is perfectly cooked. The tortilla tasted homemade. Was large, but not too large, but I would have eaten all of it regardless of the size. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a good place that is fairly priced for authentic Mexican food.  The burritos are huge and they have good lunch specials.  I also enjoy sides here and there is decent indoor seating.  Just watch the drive-thru because it can get slow at times."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time this evening with my sister and ordered take out. The service was great! The guy up front was so helpful and attentive.
 And the fish tacos and shrimp tacos are highly recommended"}
{"text":"Simple & super. Great value, bomb guac. Very satisfying for what it is. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"went to lunch here for the first time today.  Had a bean, rice, and cheese burrito and a diet coke.  Burrito was great!  Price of approximately 3.75 was great!  Diet Coke was around 1.80 which is a little high in my opinion.  Salsa bar was great!  Burrito was huge."}
{"text":"The company is from San Diego where we were originally are from. They are called Cotijas. Excellent mexican food which is very rare in Phoenix where most people here  have no idea of what good mexican food is. (They havent been exposed).
They have $5 combos that are very filling and of great value."}
{"text":"They got Taco Bell beat, but that's not saying too much.  Food is decent but I prefer Some Burro or Carolina's to this.  Funky mayo sauce in the Surfin burrito just not doing it - too much going on in there and the meat was low quality."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is made fresh and is so good! I reccomend the shrimp tacos and carne asada fries - they're my faves!!!"}
{"text":"We have wanted to try this place for awhile. Yuk I can't even say it was american Mexican sad to say we would have been better with Taco Bell. The service was poor and the enchilada sauce tasted like cheap canned sauce. We love a good taco shop this is not it. My fiancé says they should be arrested for pretending to be a authentic Mexican place lol. The shredded beef chimichanga woah they fried the lettuce in the burrito. Never again"}
{"text":"There are two Senor Taco's in Fountain Hills and boy am I happy!  Pretty much the only thing I go for is their has brown breakfast burrito.  Can't say enough about it.  It is packed to the hilt, tightly rolled in a sturdy burrito, hot and savory.  It has everything I want, sausage, bacon, sour cream, cheese, eggs, hash browns.  Typically I can eat 1/2 of it and be satisfied for the WHOLE day but I usually eat it all finishing it for my lunch.  Absolutely awesome."}
{"text":"The food here really GOOD! I have never had rolled fish tacos before but they were absolutely amazing!!! My boyfriend got the shrimp taco bowl and he said it tasted wonderful. I ordered pickup and they had it ready to go by the time I got there. Friendly prompt service, id definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for fast Mexican food that still tastes authentic."}
{"text":"I was in town from Colorado visiting family. I make it a point to try a different Mexican restaurant every time I'm here. This place is one of the best! I got the shrimp burrito and it was incredible! My son got the California burrito and loved it. This thing was gigantic and he ate almost all of it, keep in mind we're talking about a seven-year-old. The staff were very nice and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"The food is a little pricey but by God anything you buy will be delicious I have yet to order something that was not amazing. Highly recommend worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Had the California Surfer burrito. It was excellent. The chips are very tasty too. The salsa bar wasn't that impressive in my opinion. But the burrito was so good I still give Senor Taco five stars"}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food.  Breakfast burritos are pretty good.  Carnitas is excellent.  Snappy service and friendly people. Great local fast food Mexican. Beers available inside."}
{"text":"Our favorite place!  We've since moved about 15-20 mins away but still make the trip to eat here!  I haven't ever had something I didn't like here. Diablo Shrimp is amazing, you can get it made with chicken too, it's not on the menu but they'll make it, Pollo Picoso!  The fish burrito is great too, it's what got us hooked in the first place!  Their salsas are so yummy too, we love the green!"}
{"text":"Addicted! Best place ever, and only Mexican walk in I will get seafood and not be scared. Quality food and you get more than what you pay for"}
{"text":"Food is ok... the service is poor, the drive thru wait is ridiculous... They have a tip jar sitting outside the pickup window, they would be lucky if individuals felt they deserved a tip. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Went back.....eh...

Staff friendliness went down the drain. She at least cracked a smile, but it was just like take your food and go. She would just hand it and slam the window shut. She gave me my food and walked away, I had to walk back in to get extra sauce (gave 3 small ones that could use at least 6). Still she was gone, luckily they have a salsa bar. 

Breakfast burrito was good. A little bit too much potatoes, but I feel like every fast food mexican joint does that. They should just call it a mas patatas burrito con uno bacon, uno egg, uno queso, y uno salsa. 

Joking aside, I will come back. Los Favs is very good.same issue with the burritos...but there salsa is terrible...no flavor."}
{"text":"Really good fast food Mex food. Everything is a bit pricier than what you would find at some other places, but you're guaranteed much better quality. I would rank this somewhere above a Taco Bell/Del Taco and slightly below El Sol down the street, but with more variety."}
{"text":"My whole family adores this place
The shrimp taco and shrimp diablo burritos are amazing. 
The carne fries are fantastic and I love their fresh red salsa 
People complain about the wait but it's worth it. 
A quick drive up the hill home and this is a quick and delicious answer to a fast family dinner!"}
{"text":"Salsa bar lets you add whatever \"heat\" you prefer. This is a good stop when you are in the area of Power and McKelps (southeast quadrant)."}
{"text":"Food was good. Fast service and friendly. Clean establishment. Serve breakfast all day.  Pleasant to large portions. If you want water they give you the stupid child size cups. Hate places that act cheap that way. All in all very good."}
{"text":"Great \"fast food\" Mexican! Usually get the 3 rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese crisp! I love that the use the white Mexican cheese!  The guacamole is delicious!  Bean and cheese burritos are good, as well as the crane Assad burritos! Service is great and food is yummy!"}
{"text":"When I lived in AZ this was the closest place to get a gut-bomb vegetarian burrito. Their tortillas are fresh and soft, very important! I also enjoy their salsa, it's nicely smokey-spicy. I don't have to worry about what's going into my burrito when I stop here (unlike Filibertos)."}
{"text":"First time coming here... the flavor on the carnitas taco wasn't bad but the cheese in the cheese enchilada wasn't melted and came out cold along with the cold chili rellano. Not impressed."}
{"text":"THE VEGETARIAN BURRITO IS NOT VEGETARIAN!!! Warning to my veggie friends. The refried beans in it are made with lard and the rice is made with broth. Other than that their food is good. 

I don't think these people realize vegetarians do not have the enzymes to digest meat or meat broth. It makes us sick. I had to find out the hard way in this case."}
{"text":"Food is horrible, way over priced waited almost 20 minutes for my food to be gross and my order wrong. Won't bother coming here again. You're not missing anything you cant get from filibertos for cheaper."}
{"text":"Nasty. This place was dirty inside from the tables, floor to the area they were making the food. The girl at the register was coughing up a lung and had to walk away so someone else could take over. She just walked back to the food prep area coughing as she went. Gross. The salsa station was dirty and the salsa looked old. I got chicken tacos and the chicken was raw and pink inside. I didn't eat one bite. My husband took 1 bite of his egg and chorizo burrito and said he wasn't hungry. A total waste of 13.00, but at least it was only 13.00."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get some quick Mexican food. The carnitas plate is a great deal if you want a lot of food for fairly cheap. Also, the California and Surf & Turf burritos are my go to"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are great here.  The bean burrito is HUGE.  This is a better alternative to any of the near by fast food joints."}
{"text":"clean the outside of your restaurant.
i was disgusted to see the dumpster area when ordering my food. the smell was nauseating and garbage was all over also clean the wall leading up to the drive thru window. there is spit and tobacco dryed to the wall. lastly power-wash the entrance to your restaurant the cement leading in is flighty and is not welcoming to customers 
where is the pride of ownership and how the heck is management missing all of this???
i really hope the kitchen is clean.
i can't believe i even have to write this post.
this is the truth no joke...
very concerning!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good tacos, clean, friendly service. The salsa bar is amazing. The only thing missing is a margarita!"}
{"text":"Great weekday lunch place.  I rarely eat Mexican food during the work week but had to try the surf and turf burrito.  It like a mini football full of shrimp and carne asada.  Full of gooey cheese and a little sour cream.  Shrimp were fresh and the beef had great flavor.  Place is quiet with good seating and friendly staff.  I'll be back prepared with stretchy pants or shorts!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for burritos or rolled tacos. The shrimp burrito was awesome. But the carnitas was by far the best burrito we ordered. Carne asada chips were fun but overpriced."}
{"text":"I went here because they had good reviews and I won't be going back. I waited 25 minutes for a burrito of which they forgot to make or probably gave away to another customer. They don't have any type of system for giving it orders. Long waits of hungry angry people for a fast casual place they do not have it together. The manager came or several times and did nothing to help. Not a good dining experience and a waste of time if you have a limited time for lunch!"}
{"text":"Love it's tadtw and practical price. Then original Coke is great with  Mex food.
The kuds plate was more than enough .. Do we always have to write a long review?"}
{"text":"After trying many of the Mexican restaurant chains in the greater Phoenix area, I figured it was my duty to try this one out. I tend to favor the taco shops that offer seafood, which they do and a whole lot more. The menu is overwhelming to be honest, but the staff is helpful so that's a plus. 

The decor/ambiance is nothing to write home about, but it is clean which is a plus in my book and all that matters. We ordered the fish rolled tacos (5), the shrimp corn tacos and chips, guacamole and salsa. 

Unfortunately they got the rolled taco order wrong, it turned out to be beef, but they had no issues re-making the order with fish so I have to give them credit on handling that well. Just remember, if your rolled tacos come out with guacamole, tomatoes and cheese you've got beef ones, and if they come out with crema and red and green cabbage and tomatoes you have the fish ones. 

The rolled fish tacos were good, but I wouldn't order them again. The corn tacos were crisp, the toppings were good, BUT the fish was buried in all the flavors that I couldn't tell you what was in them. 

I enjoyed the shrimp tacos the most, they were perfect with plenty of shrimp filling and seasoned just right (though I favorite the ones at Rubio's just a bit more). 

The corn chips were crisp and fresh and a generous bag, with lots of leftovers. I did not care for the medium red salsa it came with one bit. I'm not sure if it's a one off, but it was as watery as tomato juice (maybe even more so). The green salsa was much better, and I'm so thankful I got guacamole because it was a lot tastier and didn't just roll off the chips. 

All and all it was a good stop for Mexican food, but I feel I'd have to try at least a handful more items from the menu to give my final feelings about the Senor Taco chain."}
{"text":"I'm in Love! Had the Flour Shell Bowl, Supreme W/ Shredded Chicken, Beans, guacamole, sour cream, salsa fresca & cheese. The taste of the meat was Amazing! The bowl was crisp, just how I like it. The only down side to this restaurant is it seemed a bit cramped inside. AND they Didn't give us our complimentary bowl of chips and salsa (that I later read is supposed to come with every meal). I can forgive them for that because I was in Mexican Food Heaven!! My husband wasn't as impressed, saying he didn't like the dining area. He had chicken enchiladas which were also good (I tasted them), but not as mind-blowing great as my flour bowl. Perhaps the superior taste of mine was due to the salsa fresca. Hard to say for certain. Pretty sure I need to research more....perhaps daily!"}
{"text":"I genuinely enjoy this place but my friend got very sick here and decided never to come here again. however, this is a small pocket of authenticity sandwiched between Subway, Panda, and Del Taco. Service is great and they always get you lots of sauces."}
{"text":"This place is one my new favorites. Diamond in the rough! My husband and I visit here often. There is a great special we get every time. Three rolled tacos and quesadilla for $5. Such a great deal! The three rolled tacos come with a huge pile of guacamole on top! And the quesadilla is giant! Great deal and tastes excellent. Last time we went we got the tostada and taco combo. Rice and beans were so authentic and yummy! The chicken in the taco had great seasoning and flavor. I can't wait to go there again! The staff was so friendly. The food was ready fast! Restaurant was very clean! It's a must try! You'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place! The food is fresh, hot, and reasonably priced. Really great, quick Mexican food. The staff is very pleasant and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"Señor Taco is my favorite neighborhood \"street vendor style food\" Mexican restaurant. The food is incredibly delicious and they offer a pretty good size menu. 

The food is always fresh, consistent, and delicious. Nothing on the menu is pricey and they have a wide variety. My favorite is the carnitas burrito... it's so good that I typically order this now every single time. Their tacos are amazing too. 

I've never had anything less than a spectacular experience every visit. The guy that owns this location is awesome. He definitely sets the tone for his staff and they all are super friendly. 

They do have a few outside tables overlooking their small parking lot, as well as the gigantic Walmart and Sam's Club across the street. 

If you require a quick charge on your phone, several of the booths have usb jacks to plug into. 

An added bonus is their is a Dunkin Donuts directly next door and they have free WiFi. 

There are several Valley locations and they've been around since the '70's. Tasting their food is all one has to sample to see why they've stuck around for decades."}
{"text":"This place is right near my mother in laws house, so it's very convenient to go to when I visit her or drop the kids off for babysitting. The food is always fresh and delicious, much like you get in a home kitchen. Their carne asada burrito is very tender unlike most of the other big chains. I also frequently enjoy their shrimp burrito which is very fresh and the shrimp are never overcooked. They have a pretty fast drive thru and their horchata is the best!"}
{"text":"Food was great and filling. Couldn't even finish the whole burrito. Jesus (the cashier) was beyond helpful with his suggestions when it came down to us choosing what to eat. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much of this place being from chandler and never hearing about it. But I wish I had food was better than I expected and prices were great. Will be returning to this spot religiously!"}
{"text":"This isn't just any Mexican food place. This place is the GOAT. I ate the Hash Brown breakfast burrito and instantly grew 4 inches. My vertical and 40yd sprint also increased. My bench max increased by 50 pounds. The tortillas aren't normal tortillas. These tortillas are crafted from the voices of angels. The green salsa is made from the finest peppers this earth can provide. I wish I could give this place more stars because it deserves endless stars. Top of the line food, speed, price, and employees. Will definitely recommend and continue going. Much better quality than Los Favoritos aka Papa Chevos aka Los Trash. Los is most definitely NOT the favorite. They don't even melt their cheese in the burritos. Señor Taco is original and keeps it 100.
If you are looking for a consistent taco joint, which delivers the most quality and farm fresh ingredients 10 times out of 10, DO NOT GO TO LOS FAVORITOS. They are not anyone's favorite. And what is going on with Filibertos? Don't even get me started on their trash food. Are they serving horse meat, like eating mutated groundhog or something. Eat at Senõr Taco if you want your children to grow up with 5 fingers and make 6+ figures."}
{"text":"OMG my new discovery. This place is a chain, I think. I love the shrimp plates, they give you a lot of shrimp, unlike some Thai places I can think of. Large portions of delicious food. Fast service. This is my new favorite Mexican place."}
{"text":"this Mexican place is my new fave. they have this dish, its like a garlic sauteed shrimp plate with rice & beans and two huge warm tortillas. Delicious, and i keep comung back for that dish. My friends get the burritos which look great and they are huge. You won't leave hungry from this place. Muy Bien :)"}
{"text":"I asked for a special order for my Uber eats in my notes. Normally never happens when I do. Got my order and they pulled through. Awesome place. Great food. Get it while it's hotttttt!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic, healthy, delicious, fast, and most importantly family owned and operated.  Really folks, if you haven't tried Senor Taco you need to go today.  A small restaurant among local giants, Senor Taco will be your favorite go-to stop.  Eat in or take out, the expansive menu has something for everyone.  Carne asada is incredible, flavorful and incredibly moist.  Scratch made beans melt in your mouth.  DELISH! Additionally, Rodrigo the Owner and Manger is hand's on, attentive and cares for every customer like a member of the family.  I've now been to the Fountain Hills location and now Scottsdale and both superb.  A hometown feel in the big city combined with fantastic food is a winning combination.  Go today, try many of the offerings and be sure to take some home for tomorrow."}
{"text":"Huge portions, well-made burritos, solid salsa, and good chips.

I came here wanting something with vegetables, and I knew immediately that I wasn't getting that. That said, I had a delicious carnitas burrito that I probably could have used as a weight for exercise. This thing was hefty! The carnitas meat was very tender and tasty. I like that there is an option for a whole wheat tortilla for the burrito (small paper notice taped to the counter beneath the cash register). The chips are solid, thick chips. I'm a fan of this kind of chip; I don't like the super thin chips that barely hold any salsa. You can put a lot on these chips!

The hot red salsa, though not really that hot, has a great taste to it. The pickled veggies and peppers were also quite delicious.

This makes for a good, relatively quick and cheap option when you are pretty hungry. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"My husband son and myself loves senor taco and we come pretty far to get it but the website information is not accurate my husband went there last night at 9 arrived around 9:30 because we thought we still had time to get food but it was closed I don't know if that's because of the holiday or what but their website says 10:00 closing time. It's just a little disappointing because we love this place but it be nice to have accurate information."}
{"text":"Hard to categorize this place. Not authentic Mexican, but definitely not straight Tex-Mex as it were. Food is good, portions are plentiful. Prices are on the higher side, but the quality is there. I really enjoy the surf and turf burrito with carne asada, shrimp, guacamole, and French fries. It's kind of a spin on the traditional California burrito. Overall, been pleased with this location, and have visited a few times. I'd skip the tacos though, although it's in the name, there are better options on the menu."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Burritos are the best!! Staff is always friendly and the food is just what we wanted - homemade goodness!!!"}
{"text":"First off, I've never had their food, but instead am reviewing their website, which is horrible. There is no information on hours of operation. Google maps says the Arizona Ave location is open 7 days a week 7am - 10pm. Yelp says open 7 days a week for the same hours except Sunday is 8am - 9pm. It's Sunday and I've been calling the Arizona location to place a pick-up order since 7am and there's no answer for 2 hours. The Senor Taco website locations listing shows the address for the Arizona Ave as 4200 S Chandler Ave. If Senor Taco owners are so inept that they get their own address wrong, and can't even convey the most basic of business information to potential customers, there's no way I'm going to let them cook my food. I'm off to Moreno's Mexican Grill where they know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burrito egg,cheese, hash brown and chipotle sauce. It may give you a heart attack but it is delicious"}
{"text":"Best carne fries I've ever had... That says a lot because I order them all the time from various Mexican food locations around Phoenix and Tucson.
I only have 4 stars because the place doesn't seem very clean and the service isn't always friendly.
I've had the enchiladas meal which is pretty good.  The sauce is a little to tomato-y for me though.  I've also had many of their burritos which are always good.  The fish tacos are hit or miss ( I've had good ones there and very gross ones).  I never order the fish tacos anymore because of two bad experiences I had where I'm pretty sure the fish was no good."}
{"text":"Best burritos out there with soooo much flavor. The California Surfin is Amazing...and they don't skimp on the shrimp either. They use a good size shrimp not those baby shrimp. You definitely have to try out this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Literally took FOREVVVVVER in the drive thru. Worst service. Asked us to wait to put in our order. We waited ten minutes. Put in the order and the car in front of us still hadn't got their order. We had to leave."}
{"text":"The burritos here are some of the best I've had in Arizona.  

I recently had the Hash Brown breakfast burrito.  Like all of their burritos, it was HUGE and filled with fresh ingredients.  Probably the best breakfast burrito I've ever inhaled.

I have also had the surf and turf burrito.  Very good, but must of the shrimp was clustered in the middle part of the burrito.  It was several bites until I tasted any shrimp.  

And finally, I had a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style.  This might have been my favorite.  

Mind  you, lest you think I am a complete pig, I did not eat all of these in one visit.  Each time I've been there, the place is virtually empty (mid morning, mid afternoon).  I do tend to go to restaurants during \"off\" hours when I can (i.e. like 2-3 for lunch) so maybe that has something to do with the lack of patrons each time I've been there.

They have a drive-thru which I utilized one morning for breakfast.  Each visit has been quick and the service staff have been friendly and I've always gotten exactly what I've ordered.  Oh - and I really like their salsa.  It's an excellent compliment to the Hash Brown burrito.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Consistently good and quick mexican food with ok service.  I enjoy the topping and salsa bar a lot.  Definitely light years ahead of other fast mexican fast food."}
{"text":"This place is the best for fast, delicious, Mexican food! I have yet to get a bad meal here.  Everything is always so flavorful! I usually go with the 2 tacos meal which comes with beans and rice for like 5 bucks (if you go in the evening)!

 I prefer the shredded beef, it is packed with the most delectable goodness. Be prepared to wait just a little bit longer than your usual fast food joint. It's totally worth it! I've been told the shrimp burrito is outstanding as well. 

You can drive thru or eat in. If you choose to eat in you can help yourself to the small salsa bar as well."}
{"text":"This  place is the bomb.  $5 lunch specials that actually fill me up and comes with a drink?  Yes, thank you!"}
{"text":"Very good food! My son and I stopped in for lunch after a round of disc golf and had our famished tummies happily filled. My son ordered a plate of two chipotle fish tacos and I ordered the plate of a shrimp burrito and two rolled fish tacos.

My son's tacos looked great and he said they tasted great. He did wipe a little of the sour cream off and said that it was a bit too much. He wolfed it down, though, and said he'd like to return to try their other menu items.

As for me, the shrimp burrito was HUGE. They did not skimp on the shrimp, either. It was filled with shrimp, rice, sour cream and some other things. It was really tasty. I think the tortilla was freshly made. I ate 3/4 of it and on of the rolled fish tacos, basically a fish taquito, so I had some left over burrito and another rolled fish taco for eating at suppertime.

There is a salsa bar and we tried the Diablo salsa, which was flavorful but not that hot, and the tomatillo salsa. The tomatillo was the best I've ever tried. Most tomatillo salsas are flavorless to me, but this one was flavorful and I enjoyed it on bites of my burrito.

We both had horchata, it is is delicious. Full bodied and creamy, it is one of the best I've tasted.

The store is clean and organized, having both tables and booths."}
{"text":"When you first opened I was thrilled, clean good food.  I told many friends about Senor Taco.  The last few months friends have told me that they no longer go there because of the bad food.
Last night I went there myself.  Ordered two beef cheese and bean tacos with extra bean to go.  There were little to no  beans, which I was charged extra for, no cheese at all,and so much grease from the meat that it did nit drip, it ran out every where.
As I was waiting for my horrible order, I noticed the filth around the sides of the salsa bar.   No this was not spills, this was dried built up food. I was leaning on the counter with my hands under the edge.  There was so much debris left from other dirty hands could not wait to go wash.  There was a brown liquid on the floor by the office door.
When I got out of the car to go inside, it smelled like sewage.
Needless to say I will not be going back, and will call the health department.  Will go back to Joses for my next Mexican food"}
{"text":"I love their carne asada taco perfect blend of mild and spicy. Always hot and fresh. Salsa bar. Small outside seating and affordable food makes me come here often"}
{"text":"I went here because I saw how many positive reviews it had and I wish I could say what they are saying but I don't agree. The food was a lil expensive for what I was getting. The food itself wasn't all that impressive either. I ordered the Hash Brown burrito and it was a mess. It had bacon, sausage, hash browns, sour cream. and eggs. I wish that every bite I had would have all of those things. I would have already ate half the burrito and I'm barely starting to taste the bacon. I really wanted to like this place but I can't. I rather stick with Filibertos that's across the street."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this location for years. Recent visits, however, have been beyond disappointing. The ingredients that were once hand-cut from whole produce are now bought-in as pre-sliced and almost certainly frozen in some cases. Senor Taco once provided hands down the best mexican food of its kind, thanks to the quality of ingredients and care taken in preparation.

I think the restaurant is likely struggling in this location, leading to cut backs. They rarely have more than two employees working on recent visits, and the interior is disgusting as a result, because no one is available to clean. Even the salsa, formerly the best reason to visit this chain on my last visit was literally inedible, leaving us to use store bought which is likely the biggest insult a mexican restaurant could suffer.

I hope they turn things around because this was my favorite, but if they do it'll be without my future business."}
{"text":"Great food!  Not great ambience .. but we had carnitas and burrito, both were top shelf!"}
{"text":"I have  been going here for about a year and have had only a few bad experiences, such as rolled tacos being ice cold in the middle, too much cheeses put on all the dishes, and bad service.

The last time I went I got the fish tacos and was sick for the next 2 days. I went online to look up their health inspection and discovered they have failed the last 2 inspections for things not being at the correct temperature and some other major violations, needless to say I will not be back until this is corrected.

And for the BIG guy that works the front counter & the drive through...smile..just a little..please. You made me feel so uncomfortable when I ordered my food..I was smiling and asking how your day was and you looked right in my face and did not respond!!"}
{"text":"The good food is ABSOLUTELY destroyed by then CONSTANT WAIT!!  I've never been through the drive-thru where I haven't had to turn off my car and wait for up to 20 minutes to get to the window.  The sweet stuff is always kind and helpful, but you can tell they do not want to pay the money to stuff it appropriately. Which makes me choose not to go there when I need fast service, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Classic fast food Mexican. Blows Filibertos out of the water. The quality of food varies but it always acceptable or better."}
{"text":"Really good, the main ingredients aren't hidden in a pile of cheese or sauce. Just great flavors all around. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is legit.  Menudo on the weekends and great combo plates.  My \"go to\" take home dinner when there is no time to cook.  This is a classic \"hole in the wall\" place to eat.  A Mexican food gem in Chandler."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. Today is the third time I came in within a week. I always get the carne asada , it's so good. But I'm gonna try something else next time, maybe tomorrow, lol!"}
{"text":"Senor Taco is the BEST! The food is very good and the servings are large if it's eat in. They do have a drive through, which i have used numerous times. I have one other favorite fast food mexican food place and if i had to choose it would be one hard decision. You can't go wrong with the Beef Tacos, the meat has a great flavor, the rice and beans are excellent."}
{"text":"So, because I have moved from California, I have become a little spoiled when it comes to Mexican food. Sadly, this place truly missed the mark when it came to their burritos. So...

Decor: So the place itself it pretty small on the inside, couple tables to sit at, and maybe 2 tv's.  Besides that, the decor is bland and not interesting. The menu is expansive and takes up almost the whole cash rack area. 

Customer Service: The cashier was really nice and answered our questions. Other than that we really didn't have any other issues in this department.

Food: This is where the review goes downhill, in a quick hurry. Sadly, we both ordered burritos. I had the new \"grilled\" chicken chipotle burrito. The chicken was not grilled, at all. I work in the food industry, and that chicken is frozen. I can promise you that \"chicken\" has never seen the light of day on a grill. It was rubbery, bland, and disgusting. The sauce in that burrito was disgustingly sweet. Why do I want a sweet sauce in my burrito? Obviously people here have never tried a true, Mexican style burrito because that was a honest shame of an attempt. You can tell the people who work there don't care a bit about the food they push out. The only plus? the \"fresh\" salsa bar. Besides that, everything was garbage.

Overall: I took 3 bites out my burrito, and threw it out. My finacee ate a couple bites of hers, and tossed it as well. It was covered in some fake guacamole, and enough tomatoes to grow a personal garden. I will never, ever go there again, and I will be calling management about the terrible experience. My advise? find somewhere else to go, a taco truck has better food than this place."}
{"text":"We almost didn't stop here because it looks like your typical fast food joint but we saw the long line at the drive thru so we thought it must be good and gave it a try. The food is delicious! Lots of choices. Authentic for a chain. Generous helpings, fast service, clean, good prices. Love the choice of sauces and spicy pickled veggies that are at your disposal. We typically order/share the carne asada quesadilla with rice and beans and can barely finish! My only gripe is their guac isn't anything special. Definitely nothing fancy, but very good, very quick and very reasonable."}
{"text":"We have been to a lot of other Mexican restaurants, best shredded chicken ever. We loved the  marinade they use. Lots of shrimp dishes I love shrimp. I got the shrimp quesadilla. So amazing. Staff is wonderful. Best Mexican food place I've been in a hot min."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru. Friendly service! The salsas tasted a little off and the burrito was a little greasy by the end. The other 3/4 of the burrito was good tho. Cheap fast Mexican food. 
Ordered a bean and cheese burrito with rice and sour cream inside."}
{"text":"I always like to start with service and 10/10 is earned. This is my first time at any Señor Taco and I was greeted with a smile and my order was taken while she asked the drive-thru customer that came after me to \"please hold\". Now raised in Mesa, AZ we have loads of authentic Mexican cuisine so I consider myself to be an expert & when I tell you their cheese enchilada & beef taco we're one point it's true. I had the #1 combo & added a horchata, it comes with the fore-mentioned items and delicious salty beans and perfectly seasoned rice. The only reason for the imperfect score is the interior.. it's a little too family friendly for my posh taste. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. With little joints like this, it always seems hit or miss. 

But color me impressed!

I got the two shredded beef tacos (#5) with rice and beans. 

The tacos were crunchy and meat savory. The beans were NOT dry like some other places. The rice was soft and fluffy. And the tomatillo salsa tasted fresh. 

A perfect lunch. Good job, señor!"}
{"text":"Most of the time I really love Señor Taco. The food is good and the portions are big. The prices are great, too. They have awesome breakfast burritos (the size of Chipotle burritos) so I highly recommend ST for breakfast if you've imbibed the night before  If you're a vegetarian like me, I recommend the bean tostadas. Doesn't sound like much but it's actually really good and only $2.99 on Tuesdays.

Another pro tip: the frozen margaritas are excellent. You may not think so since it's fast food, but I highly recommend ordering one if you eat in the restaurant.

The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is two fold. 1. Service can be REALLY slow. I sat in the drive through line for a solid 20 minutes tonight. 2. DONT use UberEats in Fountain Hills for Señor Taco. Just go get the food yourself. Two horrible experiences using this service. 

All in all, a solid choice for grub in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"Senor Taco is an authentic Mexican food restaurant for nights you want to go more casual. It has a very Hispanic environment considering they play Hispanic music and have traditional Mexican dolls and trinkets as decoration. This taco shop is located on Arizona Ave. and Ocotillo, which is an easy drive from Basha. The food arrived at my table in under five minutes which made for a more enjoyable experience because I'm very impatient. The restaurant also had great customer service. The manager was friendly and checked up on me, welcomed and said goodbye.
 I ordered a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style with red sauce and a side of beans and cheese, and my whole meal was only $5.16! That was such an amazing price considering I was able to take home half and enjoy it for another meal. I would definitely rate this Mexican food restaurant among my top two favorites. The beans were very cheesy and that was perfect for me. The burrito itself was also very delicious and mouthwatering. The restaurant was a little bit crowded due to the fact that it is small but there was no chaos happening, so they know how to run a restaurant efficiently. 
 This restaurant in my opinion is something you cannot pass up. If you ever want quality Mexican food for a reasonable price there is no other place but Senor Taco. Senor Taco is very unique and not like any other \"Los\". My restaurant provided a warm family friendly welcome and fabulous food to go along with it. The only reason that I could see that would make you not want to go would be because you don't like Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Pork carnitas 5 starts

Service 2 stars: girl seemed angry she had to stop texting and take our order"}
{"text":"So all of the guys at work were raving about this place so I finally decided to give it a try. And let me tell you I was pleasantly surprised! It has such a quaint interior with some pretty high tech registers and it is really clean. The food is fresh and was delicious. You definitely have to try their salsa verde. It's KILLER. ;) I would definitely recommend giving this place a try if you've been skeptical. It's definitely worth your while."}
{"text":"Well I can't say that I have eaten the food here as they mixed up my order via drive thru. And I will say don't expect to go thru the drive thru quickly. I called to explain my situation and the phone call didn't quite make me feel great about this place but I was refunded no questions asked when I went in so I do plan to revisit this place again soon as I so badly want to find some good Mexican food in NE Mesa. I will repost when I get to try the food."}
{"text":"Best salsa bar hands down. Love all the salsas equally. My new favorite Mexican joint. Fresh grilled Serrano peppers included at the salsa bar. Omg they are hot!!! Huge burritos, love the chili verde. Give this place a try, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"We had heard this was an exceptional place to eat and it certainly is.  I do prefer ground beef tacos but the shredded beef came out just fabulous.  Will be back to try rest of menu since we just moved to the area.  
We had good service and when we went to eat outside and all the tables were cleared but dirty (its 3pm and no other customers) a lady immediately came out and washed a couple of tables.  Not all of them mind you, but at least we had a clean one to sit at.

Loved the salsa bar.  Great green salsa."}
{"text":"I know this is a Mexican restaurant, but they seriously have the best french fries in town. I have driven there a few times just for the fries. Oh, they also have phenomenal tamales. 

The staff here is pretty great too. My order is always really complicated, but they are always polite and my order has not come back wrong yet. I love Senor Taco!"}
{"text":"Since arriving in AZ, I've been to about 1/2 a dozen Mexican restaurants. This, by far, has been the best. It was \"late\" one Friday evening- 8:30pm (well, late for AZ I guess- nothing else in the area was open) and my wife really didn't want to go in. It does have that \"kind-of a dive, but not quite a dive\" look about it. (Also has a drive-through)

We tried the grilled chicken-burrito dinner and it was fantastic! The beans and rice were plentiful and delicious and the Salsa Bar was excellent.  The chicken was fresh and really grilled- not shredded. 

I would definitely recommend this place. This was the first \"non-disappointed\" Mexican dinner experience since arriving from Chicago. And they're opened \"really late\": to 11pm!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good.  The service is why they are getting 3 stars.  I have been to this location several times, and have seen some of the same people each time.  They have messed my order up numerous times.  I guess it is a good thing the food is good."}
{"text":"Oh how I was over-joyed when my beloved Senor Taco opened a 2nd location in Fountain Hills!!

You guys/gals really do \"get it right\". I have made several referrals to visiting company (from out of state) and have rec'd rave reviews from them on their dining experience.


Extra EXTRA hungry? Then try the Senor Burro. I dare you. Soooo delish and sooo huge. I'm serious, that thing comes out and I swear it weighs a couple of lbs. It looks like a 2-year old's leg! Ok, so I don't eat the whole thing in one setting. I can squeeze out a good 3-4 meals from this menu must have! 

Shrimp Burrito is another fave of mine. Lovely. And the churros?? OMG... thought I'd died and gone to heaven. Those are always served FRESH out of the fryer and have the perfect combo of cinnamon/sugar. Be careful - too much enthusiasm will yield burn blisters on top of your mouth. You have been warned."}
{"text":"Senor Taco is amazing. Great food, good prices, good service. The Bean Burrito enchilada style with red sauce is so good, beats out many expensive local Mexican restaurants and it is big enough to split between two people. The crunchy shredded beef taco's are really good and taste home made and not generic reheated. 

The salsa bar is really good and has great spicy and mild options. This girl loves her some hot sauce so any Mexican restaurant that has a salsa bar has special place in my heart. Senor Taco is great. Eat here. Often."}
{"text":"Super tasty food, reasonable prices, fast and friendly service. Plus they serve beer! I especially love their chili oil. Way better than Filibertos."}
{"text":"Finally Scottsdale got a good little takeout place! We frequent Senor Taco at least once a week, and are always happy we do. Love the carnitas tacos and refried beans. Staff is always very sweet as well. One of our go-to weeknight places."}
{"text":"Yummy food, great price, mediocre service. :) Like the salsa bar."}
{"text":"100% Not a healthy meal choice, but 100% delicious! 

I have been here multiple times, my first order was a breakfast burrito- for lunch & yes it was great! I had eggs, potatoes, ham, and cheese. They let me add and subtract whichever ingredients I wanted, which is always a plus. Con of the breakfast burrito is that they do not offer egg white substitution. Now, this is not a major problem, but it is an option I typically take advantage of whenever I go out for breakfast elsewhere. The tortillas are so delicious, fresh, and soft! And while some people may complain about the price of burritos, they are massive. Honestly, it is one of the biggest burritos I have ever received and I could only eat half, and I have a huge appetite! I have also ordered the special shrimp quesadilla, the shrimp was juicy and tender and the sour cream type of sauce added great flavor profile. The only con to this was the massive amounts of cheese on this quesadilla, so much that by the time I drove 5 minutes back to my office to eat it, the grease had just about soaked through my entire tortilla.

But, overall, the food is fantastic and it is always busy around lunch time with the surrounding offices and buildings! Yum!"}
{"text":"That was the best veggie burrito I've ever had. Can't wait to go back and try more items on the giant menu!!  The employees were super nice and helpful with what I should try next. See you soon :)"}
{"text":"Arizona has a great selection of Mexican food.  I had a delicious meal last night, Combo #4 Beef Taco and Bean Tostada for $7.49.  Beef was stringy (not ground beef like from Taco Bell) and everything was healthy, not oily.  

I did find the taco shell a bit hard though, I would have preferred more light and crispy.  Looking forward to trying the rest as they have quite a selection on their menu!"}
{"text":"Damn good Surf and Turf Burrito, I was very skeptical about the sea food in these taco joints especially when I tried asking for one at filibertos and it was terrible, but this place served it up proper.  2nd time here and it's been nothing short of great.   
The only down fall here is probably the hours because I live close by and I could really go for a late night burrito that the other failed taco joints are known for."}
{"text":"Great place for inexpensive, fast food.  The California Surfin burrito is exceptional.  Friendly staff, good food."}
{"text":"Just great!!!! I stopped here today for lunch because I was craving fish tacos and was happy to find this little gem!! WOW!!!!! They are perfect and HUGE!!! I just found a new place for them - YAY!!!"}
{"text":"Thought I would give it a try after finding it on yelp.  The first good sign is seeing a big lunch time crowd, nice outside seating area and clean restaurant.  I ordered the #5 chicken taco combo plate, which is my mexican food staple.  Good looking salsa bar and the food was ready quick.  It seemed to be a little pricey for this type of place (8.50) but the combo plate was ample.  One pet peeve I have is no chips to go along with the great salsa bar, a la chipotle.  The food was good, not great.  However, based on the large crowd, maybe I missed something on the menu that is obviously bringing the people in."}
{"text":"The fish taco meal for 6.99 comes with beans, rice and chopped lettuce/tomatoes and a drink.  The best fish taco in town,  maybe the state. The salsa bar has a good variety but my favorite is a combo of the oil and mild green salsa.  The fish taco plate is big enough to share too with younger burrito fans. Just order a side of tortilla and fill it with the beans from the taco meal."}
{"text":"I use to like eating here until recently. Food quality has been declining. Today was the absolute worst! I literally had to spit the food out of my mouth it tasted so bad. Left a bad taste in my mouth. I'll never eat here ever again!"}
{"text":"One of the best unassuming Mexican restaurants in the valley. I've been going here for years. I am trying to eat everything in the menu. I'm over half way thru it. And everything has been amazing!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to eat here. They have delicious mexican food that is made fresh when ordered (that's why I recommend you eating in or calling ahead). The flour tortillas taste and look homemade. The tortas and burritos here are my favorite. I love me some Señor Taco! Service is friendly too!"}
{"text":"Food is average. Playing Hispanic music in the lobby doesn't mean you serve good Mexican food. Burrito was sloppy and over packed with potatoes and hardly any meat. Shredded Beef is horrible. Poor mixture of meat with onions and tomatoes. Looks like dog food. Enchiladas were below par. Not sure how you mess enchiladas up but this place did it, way to GO Señor Taco."}
{"text":"So far we have tried this hut 4 times and I have yet to have any issues listed below. 

I usually order the carne asada either in a burro or on chips and they are usually the best around here in the great Goodyear tire.

Wife has had shredded beef Tacos, surf and turf, or the super fries. 

I suggest ordering it without the salsa fresca and just using their red sauce because it makes it better.

Food has always been hot, and a reasonable value and I have not had any issues with service so far. Food has not made me sick, but then again I have eaten around the world and I believe I'm fairly immune to the taco bug.

Check this hot spot out, I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Really dig Senor Taco...always have ever since the old Fountain Hills days!  Used to go around the mountain for these tacos until this location opened up several years ago.

This review is about their soft flour tacos (they have soft corn too). I'm allergic to corn so the flour variety is all I have eaten here. I have tried all the meats and have found a favorite.

CARNE ASADA TACOS PLEASE!

I love that I can get a steak taco for breakfast!  That's usually the time of day I visit and I found that their steak is the most consistent I have had from any Mexican chain. That's the main reason for 5 stars here but the service has always been friendly too! 

We all know at some point if you order steak every time at most restaurants, it's just a matter of time until you get a bad piece ... NOT HERE!  After almost 100 carne asada tacos I have never had a single bad piece! That's impressive quality control.

Nice people, great steak and a real salsa bar make this spot worth trying if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Food was marginal. Tostadas shells were hard, old, and not nice. Cheese enchiladas were not heated all the way through, so cheese was just warm shredded cheese inside a tortilla. Fish taco was chewy and hard, not crispy and light. Salsas are not freshly made. How someone could give this 5 stars is a total mystery."}
{"text":"came here to get some tacos on the tuesday special. The tacos are ok but the guy at the register shouldn't be the face of the restaurant, always on his cell phone and when you ask for something that ended up being on the counter, he points and goes right back to his phone. he wasn't really rude but didnt seem like he wanted to help"}
{"text":"Bomb bomb bomb filibertos is finished! If you are close to this place hit it up! Definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is great, service has been great each time I've been there, and the prices are so reasonable. I love the breakfast burrito and the shrimp burrito is AMAZING! Everything is made to order and they are quick."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  I got into town late on Friday and wanted something quick to take with me.  Since they had a drive-thru, I assumed it would be fast.  It wasn't, but the food was great.  I had the enchilada combo and really enjoyed it.  They have a pretty extensive menu for other dishes as well.
(Frequent traveller from out-of-town)"}
{"text":"Good food but side are pretty high in price. I didn't get the correct food I ordered and some of the people are hard to understand."}
{"text":"Carne asada fries is so good!  Topped with guacamole, salsa, sour cream and cheese!  Still on the greasy side though..."}
{"text":"I had spotted this place a couple of weeks ago, apparently new in my neighborhood.  I got a combo with one crispy taco, 2 quesadillas and three rolled up tacos covered with guacamole, cream and cheese... Only 8 dollars, which also included a drink.  Anyways, the food was great, it was fresh and very tasty.  I will definitively come back and recommend.  The staff was very nice and service was quick.  I'm glad Señor Taco is so close to my place.
As an update, today I stopped by again, two weeks after I had drafted this review... Guess what, I think the food was even better this time.  I've found my favorite Mexican food in Glendale so far."}
{"text":"Great food! It never disappoints. If you're not sure what to get try their chicken fajita quesadilla! It's amazing, you can also get it in steak or shrimp."}
{"text":"Avoid!
They are under different management/ownership.  Don't expect the same service and quality. Everything used to be ordered and delivered exactly like I wanted. I went yesterday and didn't receive what I asked for nor was it correct when I did get it. Loyal customer not coming back."}
{"text":"Feel like every time I order threw drive through I have to say it three times. And if its a good day I'm lucky I have gotten what I ordered correctly. Carne asada no pico with rice and beans.. Almost always forget something. Taste is bomb but, can u get my order right. I don't know Spanish or I'd say it in Spanish. Gracias"}
{"text":"I always passed by this place on the way to my mother's and I finally gave it a try!  I am glad I did too.  I decided to try their menudo, and I am very picky when it comes to menudo.  It wasn't greasy, it had great flavor and had a balance of hominy.  I also tried their Chicken tacos with beans and rice.  Their beans taste like my Nana's homemade beans.  I was very happy with this place.  It is also very clean place.  They may take a little long with your order, but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp tacos and rolled tacos for take out. The shrimp tacos were very big, I wasn't a huge fan of the rolled tacos. Also asked for a side of tortilla chips and received a huge bag (that's not a complaint). Solid salsa bar and guacamole."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, good portions, yummy food (huge burritos, amazing rolled tacos, and my sister loved the fish tacos). Very impressive. I thought it was just going to be a so-so fast food place. It definitely proved me wrong!"}
{"text":"This is our spot we come here atleast once a week they have $1.39 tacos . My favorite's are Al pastor, carne asada it's so delish as always. The service is quick we come here for lunch with our co-workers it's always a pleasure.... 
They have a selection of salsas they are all good my favorite is the green. I definitely recommend coming here. They have a special on Tuesday a taco rice, beans and enchilada for five bucks !!! That's a deal."}
{"text":"Got to say that from the name, I figured it was just another lame fast-food taco joint. It is anything but. The food is always fresh and tasty. I'm hooked on the soft tacos and haven't tried anything else...YET. Good stuff."}
{"text":"The Shrimp burrito is my fav. 

Prices are acceptable and food is made to order. If you get it to go it still super hot at home!!!

I requested the hot sauces with my to go order ( one  hot and one mild) and soso please to find 2 of each when I arrived at home.

This is one of my fav places to eat when I visit FH."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints, in the food department. The drive through wait can be a bit ridiculous, but the food has always been worth it. I love their chicken rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese. Add their red sauce.. yum!!!  My husband can't get enough of their shrimp burrito. Honestly, we haven't tried anything else."}
{"text":"This place is so sad. I do like their food but their customer service is the worst I have ever seen. The employees are rude and their are several items on the menu that they don't want to prepare. This is honestly the first 1 star review I have given but trust me it was well deserved."}
{"text":"Discovered this place in my search for ceviche near work. Can't beat $4 for a sizable shrimp tostada ceviche. Very good! I've also had the carne asada and shrimp tacos with the pinto beans and Mexican rice. Affordably priced and very tasty!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food place. The only complaint I have is the length of the drive thru during lunch and dinner hours. Fresh food, clean, tastes good. Try the guacamole, as it is amazing. Personal favorite is the California burrito."}
{"text":"Mexican Approved  
I recently moved to Scottsdale and I've been trying Mexican restaurants and this place is so good! Perfect! The food is great, they have mexican soda  and the place is well taken care of. The place is clean and well kept.  I would definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"I love the shrimp burrito,best one I have had so far..also the rolled fish tacos are the bomb....worth the money cause its good and you get alot mmmmmm mmmmm"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Mexican food near home. I appreciate how fresh my food always is, but the wait times are ridiculous. Although, my order is always correct and the food makes the wait worth it."}
{"text":"We just moved to Fountain Hills, we were familiar with Senor Taco having been to the location just off Shea. 
We truly like Senor Taco, but I dare say that this one is better than the other... just slightly. 

We aren't fans of fast food in general, and this isnt exactly fast food. Its made to order and quick food. You can tell that this is fresh and good quality.  It is super yummy. 

It's really close to the house. We will definitely be back to this location!"}
{"text":"Great food! Rude girls at register. This was our first time and we really liked how fresh the food tasted and it came fairly quickly for how busy they were.... But, the (young) girl at the front counter register had a disrespectful tone, rolled her eyes and then smirked when I was mistaken about what comes with something I was trying to order.  I was truly perturbed with how rude she was, as if we were inconveniencing her(isn't that why they are needed?).
We had Chicken Enchiladas, Shrimp Enchiladas, Shrimp Tacos and Fish Tacos and all were quite tasty."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding!!  Best Mexican food in this price range.  The burritos are amazing, and the fish tacos are epic.  We come here often... great place!

** Update 2017:  Sadly the day has arrived.  Senor Taco has *significantly* raised prices to where the point that this is no longer the great deal it used to be.  I'll still come here once in awhile, but almost nine bucks for the enchilada meal a bit much."}
{"text":"No bacon in my burrito that is supposed to have bacon. This has happened on multiple occasions. I pay full price for half the product. Not acceptable. Could it be because I am white?"}
{"text":"I been coming here for years. Always through the drive through and yes they do have longer wait time but it's simply because you can tell their food is fresh. It's worth the wait. Adobada tacos are really good, carne asada fries and the rolled tacos is the norm for me. I won't recommend the horchata simply because it taste like they mix it versus making it from scratch. On Saturday the drive through are open until 1am which is nice."}
{"text":"I really like their food, it's really good. I just wish the inside of the restaurant was nicer and didn't smell like disinfectant."}
{"text":"So simple yet so delicious, stopped in and needed a quick lunch. The service was fast and friendly and the food was damn tasty. Señor Taco appears to be a 7 unit chain in the Phoenix area but dang if I could find a website linking the places. Ordered a Carne Asada soft taco and chicken hard shell taco. The beef is sourced from Black Canyon and is on point. They are very generous with the beef and the guacamole was a welcome addition. The guacamole, carne Asada and pico de gallo had such flavor that I only added a little of the Diablo sauce for contrast. I really could eat this taco every day of my life and I will have to reach out to Phillip T. of Las Vegas to get the attorney he used to file against Ace Donuts if these folks try to put up shop in Sacramento. The chicken taco was good. The chicken was cooked in a red sauce that was more wet than tasty. Amazingly, the hard shell held form. The sauce was so wet it marred the other flavors. I asked the server what type of shredded cheese they used on the taco and she said mozzarella. For all I knew it could have been Brie. Anyways the carne Asada taco was a 6 and the chicken taco was a 3. Señor Taco stay out of Sacramento or there will be trouble."}
{"text":"Probably the best tamales I have had in a long time. Their crunchy tacos are yummy!  Sauces you can get are really good, though I prefer the green over the red."}
{"text":"This place has the best Mexican food in all of AZ atleast for a taco shop. Being from San Diego this is the closest thing to authentic . The mex food in this state is no bueno except for this place. They also happen to be from San Diego maybe that's why lol I've tried many things here and everything has been good. Great Carne Asada burrito , ranchero taquitos, flautas, California surfin burrito.. Awesome salsa bar. It's a small place but it's clean , has a bathroom and staff is friendly. Also you get a lot for your money. ;-)"}
{"text":"All I have to say is best Mexican food in AZ!! Everything else  is crap! Lol if your from San Diego you'll know what I mean. P.S. There originally from San Diego. Must try ! You won't be disappointed. Big portions! Good prices"}
{"text":"Stupid name, blindingly bright menu, DELICIOUS. FOOD.  My parents have been raving about this place, so they took me for dinner one day when I was visiting for the holidays.

I got the veggie burrito, and the behemoth that came out of the kitchen barely fit on the flimsy paper plate.  It was delicious (the guacamole was excellent), filling, cheap, and it came with a side of chips!  My mom got the chicken quesadilla, and I swear to god, it was the largest single serving size of anything that I've ever seen.  She got 2 more meals out of it.  My dad got the shrimp tacos, and they disappeared quickly.

I was really impressed with the salsa bar.  Everything tasted homemade, with options that covered the spectrum of mild to spicy.  The guy at the counter was friendly, but he didn't even need to be because the food was just that good.

It made me sad that I live so far away.  Chipotle just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"I'm tough on Mexican food outside of El Paso. I'll be the first to say that it's tough to sway me away from what I believe is great Mexican food since I grew up in an area some would consider a mecca for it. Visiting Arizona led us on a wild goose chase for breakfast and, after failing to find the bagel shop, we stopped here. It definitely had vibes of california Mexican food so I went with a surf n turf burrito (wet: with enchilada sauce & cheese) and my lady got the breakfast torta. Both were decent plates. The enchilada sauce was too salty and kind of took away from the surf n turf. That's my mistake. The torta was fairly bland and felt more like home food (not in a great way).  I was upset about this place and a major turnoff was seeing the woman who worked there eating the chips while making our food. The serving size was huge but it didn't make up for the lackluster taste. Also, as we drove out of the parking lot...we noticed the bagel shop right next door in the shopping center beside it. Definitely trying the bagels next time."}
{"text":"I ordered a burrito with chorizo, potatoes, cheese and with no egg! I was very specific when I made this order. Being Hispanic I ordered it in Spanish. They still got my order wrong. The burrito came with egg and potatoes only. 

The upsetting part was the ticket was correct. The cook in the back doesn't give a dam about what you want in the food. 

The funny part is that you can add language barrier, but when the orders are made with perfect Spanish there is no excuses. 

Fist and last time I will purchase any food from this place."}
{"text":"Wanted to substitute sausage for bacon in a breakfast burrito. They charged me an extra $1.00 for that. I asked her why. She said she is not allowed to substitute any ingredients - ever.

PSA for those of you who don't like their food EXACTLY the way it's printed on the menu.

I won't be back. Doesn't matter how good the food is. Restaurants with business practices that don't make sense do not earn a return visit."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! Been craving steak and shrimp burritto since the bay area, this place had it, not overpriced like the ones in vegas and was so addictingly delicious we came back a couple of times while we were in town. Their shrimps are huge and they are generous with the shrimp and steak and the sauce was amazing. Keep up the great work and dont change anything. I only wished they had Senor Taco in Las Vegas, you guys would be a hit at the communities off the strip as well as on!"}
{"text":"So I usually order from this location all the time and have not had a problem but today I did in a major way! There was a staple in my food that I bit into! This is just ridiculous I always hear about people finding weird things in their food but never have I been in this position."}
{"text":"Whole lotta food for your money  

Try different things when you go.
 Try the fajita chicken quesadilla if really hungry."}
{"text":"My first visit here, and not very impressed.  I ordered the Pollo Asado burrito, and was a little surprised at how quickly my order was ready.  You'd think that would be a good thing, but I soon found out why it wasn't in this case.  I took one bite of the burrito, and the whole thing practically fell apart in my hands.  From then on, the whole meal became damage control and a quest to break the all-time napkin use record for one burrito.  It tasted ok, but not worth the trouble or effort to finish the whole thing.  I won't be in any hurry to come back here."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with senor taco. This place is great. Haven't had one bad thing. Try the carnitas burrito, or fish tacos....yum."}
{"text":"I am completely obsessed with the hash brown burrito!!! The sausage and bacon are the counterparts to the hash browns, sour cream, and cheese and the combination sends my taste buds into a frenzy. This is our weekend go-to and because you can get breakfast anytime, it's often a week night dinner treat!!

I would love to rate some of the other food but I haven't been able to order anything else yet!!"}
{"text":"We went to Senor Tacos twice over the past few days while visiting from Southern California. Our first trip I had a machaca burrito with potatoes and my mom had a carnitas taco.  The burrito was huge!  The flavor was good, but as good as I have had.  I put some salsa verde on and it was pretty good.  My mom's taco was really good and very filling.  Our second trip I had two shredded chicken hard tacos, my mom had two soft carnitas tacos, my cousin had the chicken avocado salad and we shared some beef rolled tacos.  Everything was great, the chicken had great flavor.  We will definitely keep this in mind on more visits."}
{"text":"Place is great!! Moving from CA to AZ we definitely needed a good Mexican food joint. This is it. From the shrimps cocktail to the carne fries to the salad to the bomb chicken tacos and shrimps burrito along with the salsa bar....speaking of bar,  happy hour from 3-7 and excellent friendly customer service and a freakin drive thru....how can you beat it?? well, in Goodyear you cant so I am SOLD :)"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here!!! The service is top notch as well as the food quality! I have been to plenty of Mexican food places, but I have to say that this has got to be the best place I have been too in a long long time. I definitely recommend anyone to come here and eat!"}
{"text":"With so many decent taquerias in Chandler, differentiating isn't easy. But Senor Taco sets itself apart with tortilla-shell bowls (like a taco salad) and salsa bar that includes roasted peppers."}
{"text":"Love love their food!!!!!! Enchiladas are delicious!!! Beans are fresh the rice could be better tho:( The food takes a bit but only because its made to order fresh! I like it that better than fast food tho! The price is pretty good for most items plus they have specials all the time! !!!"}
{"text":"I hate to break my loyalty to to Fillibertos across the street, but Senor Taco is awesome! I love that you can get discounted fish tacos in Baja Wednesday and not just taco Tuesday like other places. The guacamole is not worth it, but the food overall is great and the menu has everything you'd want"}
{"text":"Awesome taquitoes and shrimp burrito!  Fast service. Clean restaurant. Will return soon."}
{"text":"This place doesn't look that great but looks can be deceiving. I would not drive across the city to eat here but I would definitely make this a top choice if one is nearby.

The guac is nothing to call home about but they give you a lot. I did not like the melted cheese on the chips. How come you do not have queso dip? I ordered the shrimp tacos. Plenty of shrimp and very tasty. They also have a salsa bar which is pretty clutch."}
{"text":"Cheap and plentiful tacos. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this place but I would mind trying this place again."}
{"text":"Very good tamales! And they come loaded with toppings. Cheese, shredded lettuce, guac, sour cream, etc..."}
{"text":"This makes some pretty decent tacos. It's very similar to Filabertos and Del Taco but a little cleaner. They have the normal things like carnitas, chicken and shredded beef. I always see the drive-thru packed during the week which means the locals in the Red Mountain and Las Sendas area."}
{"text":"They butchered our order. They should fix the speaker for the drive through so they can hear us next time"}
{"text":"I order from them a lot because they have the best bean and cheese burrito that I get cravings for.  It is good food and good price."}
{"text":"Service is hit and miss (usually miss). Rolled tacos are the same...once in awhile they get to me soggy, falling apart and generally inedible. Surf N Turf burrito is interesting, delicious and the only thing saving the joint from a 1 or 2 star review. =(

Duplicate this review for the location at Indian School and Dysart."}
{"text":"Awesome place good food well worth the money my wife got enchiladas and I got the señor burrito and its huge and chicken nachos for our daughter service was really good fast and accurate"}
{"text":"Pretty good! Came here several times already. Prices are VERY good... and food is very decent with big portions! I love their beef rolled tacos with gauc (~$3-$4). Sometimes I crave it when I want something lighter. My husband is in love with their chicken enchiladas and gets the same thing every time. The tacos and quesadillas are decent, but not my favorite on the menu. I also tried the Surfin Burrito. My friend thinks its 'to die for,' but I personally think its decent but not my favorite. My favorite is the rolled tacos with gauc!! :) We will be regularly going back here. 

On tuesdays, combos are $5. Everyday after a certain hour.. I think after 5 or 6pm... combos are also $5. That's cheaper than McDonalds!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican! We got this delivered through Uber eats. We tried the Diablo shrimp burrito, shrimp enchiladas, shrimp tacos and carnitas tacos all were great! If you want some quick Mexican this is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place. If you are looking for a quick, affordable, and authentic Mexican food solution, look no further."}
{"text":"I went to Red Mountain High School just a mile away, and for seniors who could go off campus to lunch, this place was where it was at. It has such affordable prices, coupled with the most monster portions you can find in Mesa, it makes for my favorite casual Mexican restaurant.
Their menu is fairly similar to Filiberto's for anyone else who grew up in Mesa and knows, but their portion sizes blow even the famous Fili's out of the water. Everything they serve is authentic, full of flavor, made to order, and makes the absolute most out of your money."}
{"text":"The best carbs asada nachos out there!!! Everything on the menu is good. Good price too. You can eat in or take it to go."}
{"text":"The food quality is very inconsistent. When it's good it's amazing, but some days it is some of the worst. The meat will be either super old or overcooked and tastes and feels like its burnt to a crisp. I find myself not wanting to go here as much just because I never know if I'm going to spend $20 on amazing or awful. It if was always good they would definitely have more stars. It's sometimes a little pricey and you have to pay for things that most mexican restaurants will give you (like chips and salsa)."}
{"text":"Really expensive for \"fast food Mexican\". We just moved by here and thought we woudl try it out after reading the reviews on here. It was SUPER salty (yes I eat a lot of Mexican food and LOVE spice, etc. I know Mexican food is salty in general so for me to point that out, means something). The only thing I like were the tacos. They were decent and not too bad actually. The enchiladas were mediocre at best and their rice and beans were plain and boring. Think I'll stick with Filiberto's. They are much cheaper and these two are equal on the playing field of fast food for Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food is great but beware:   The drive through is the slowest I have experienced anywhere.  I don't know what they are doing wrong but after the second time of a 30 minute wait for 3 cars I will not be using the drive through again."}
{"text":"We use to come here often.  However in the past few months they have been raising their prices all the time.  This fish tacos that I use to love now cost 90% more than they did at the beginning of the year.  Even worse, they aren't even good anymore because they cut the size of the fish in half and just put more cabbage and pico on it to try and mask the difference.  So, not only did they raise their prices by a ton, but they decreased their portion on this particular item.  I've heard their is new mgt/ownership this year, so I guess that may be why.  We won't be coming back anymore."}
{"text":"Yummy cheap food! Everything is fresh and tastes great! So glad we found this gem. I love their rolled chicken things and they have this awesome Carna asade fries that are gluten free"}
{"text":"Of the fast food style Mexican joints (Fillbertos, Los Favs, America's Taco Shop, etc.), Senor Taco is my absolute favorite. The food is not the best I ever had, but the portions are huge and there is something to be said about quantity! I also love the flavor of the green salsa in the salsa bar. Most places just whip up a salsa verde which is mostly jalapeno and just hot with no flavor. The green salsa has a distinctly tomatillo flavor and I pour this stuff all over my meal. Tip: The beef rolled tacos (taquitos) are waaaaaaaay more flavorful than the chicken ones and the cashier will let you mix things up if you prefer more beef than chicken or vice versa."}
{"text":"I usually stop here after a long hard bike ride at Hawes or at McDowell Mt.(Fountain Hills Location). My go to is the carnitas burrito. Although I could devour the whole thing, I cut it in half and take half home. My daughter gets excited when she knows I'm going biking, because that means she gets the other half of my delicious meal! If I ate the whole thing in one sitting, that kind of defeats the purpose of the exercise I just did.

Everything is yummy, haven't had anything I don't like. Everyone I've taken there becomes a fan.  I love the chili oil, it has a great smokey taste and goes great on the burrito. The tomatillo salsa fantastic, so are the carrots and jalepenos. They need to open one of these in Gilbert/N. Chandler area. (near me)

The place doesn't look like anything special, small dining area, outside patio, some Mexican decor. But it's always clean, the people are nice, the food excellent, it comes out fast and hot. If you want sit-down fancy go to Scottsdale. But if you want good food, reasonable prices, huge portions, come here!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest but not bad either. Bust taste is subjective, service was alright except I ordered Carne Asada Fries and kept watching people who came in after me get there food first."}
{"text":"I love their Carnitas plate!  Large portion and has nice flavor.  Tortillas are excellent."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food for being a fast food restaurant. Give yourself extra time when visiting this restaurant they are slow, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"This food is good authentic mexican food, i highly recommend them if you love good mexican foods.."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast burritos!! All food is made fresh so expect to wait a few minutes after ordering but I promise you won't regret it."}
{"text":"My girlfriend insisted we come and eat here for breakfast.  There was nothing overly terrible about it, but it just didn't wow  me the way I am used to taco stands home in Texas doing.  Usually the decor in these places is forgivable because of the authenticity of the food, but here, I just wasn't feeling it. One plus is that they have a good collection of \"aguas\".  I wouldn't outright avoid it either though.  The food was more than reasonably priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed. I just picked up my food and as I was eating I noticed a long black hair in my food. Needless to say I got grossed out and tossed the food."}
{"text":"CLEAN Restaurant was the very first thing we noticed. Cool decor with authentic Mexican flare.

The two cashiers were very pleasant and so informative. They have several other locations and a new one will open soon in Ahwatukee.

Salsa bar- Hot carrots, radish relish, jalapeños and 3 hot sauces. Again very clean!

I got the half order of nachos. Plenty! I'm sure the full order is huge! My son got the Carne Asada Burrito-the most GIGANTIC ever! 

The nachos were great, all ingredients were fresh. The guacamole was the \"best yet\" that I've tasted in Arizona. Also, had a side of enchilada sauce to dip! Fantastic!

That burrito was demolished and I was amazed my son could eat the whole thing! 

Staff shared that they make everything homemade \"in house\"! From the salsas to the guacamole, they even have fresh horchata & Mexico Chiquito punch.

Really enjoyed our visit & meal. A shame we were the only patrons dinning in?! 

Great staff, Great service & Great Place. Go see for yourself!"}
{"text":"I know this place is a hit with my neighbors, but it just wasn't on my list. We had a taste for tacos, and wanted to try a new place. My wife suggested Senior Taco. I owe her one. Good stuff here. Good value. Daily specials, and combo plates make some affordable choices. Too much food for my wife, she know what to order next time. Mine was just right."}
{"text":"Tried the carnitas burrito with red Chile. Excellent! Very flavorful and filling. If you really like spicy, try it with the diablo salsa. 

Definitely going to sample other items on their menu when I get the chance."}
{"text":"There's a lot of Mexican options in Mesa, but this one is one of the best I've found. I used to go to Tia Rosa's, but more often these days we hit up Senor Taco. The portions are huge and value priced, and they have a great salsa bar. I usually get the Special #2, which is a stuffed carne asada burrito with 3 rolled tacos covered in guacamole, and a soda, all for under $10. I leave stuffed or with a to-go box (usually the former). You might not think much of it as you drive past the strip mall it is a part of, but take the detour and enjoy the big meal.  There is limited indoor seating, and although there is a large patio I wouldn't want to sit outdoors in the summer."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite before hitting the road. Carnitas Torta was spectacular. As good or better than any I've tried in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. It was taco Tuesday so I was excited to get tacos after swimming. Unfortunately I didn't get there till 30 minutes before they closed. (Doesn't matter at a good establishment) I understood it was late so made sure to be extra polite and apologize. I get my food and its cold. I'll post a picture of my tacos. Burn shell and what \"shredded\" beef looked like. For the price I will be going to filibertos or Los favorites for better quality and cheaper."}
{"text":"Fantastic food at super prices. Combos drop in price to $5.00 after 5:00. It's a great deal with such delicious food. The employee were friendly and gave super recommendations. We'll definitely be back and make it our go to restaurant when in west Phoenix. Make sure to give it a try!"}
{"text":"This makes me sad to have to write this one.  This second location in Fountain Hills seems to not be consistently providing quality recently.  I got my favorite El Diablo Shrimp Burrito.  Normally they are huge and loaded with shrimp and lots of rice and sauce.  Two weeks ago, there was barely any filling at all.  It was mostly eating a tortilla.  Ok, one off day - no big deal.  Went in a week later and ordered it again.  It was burned.  Filling volume was better, but it looked all dark spotted inside and just didn't taste right.  And the bag of chips I bought was stale.  The main reason to have to write the review is what was seen while waiting for the takeout order. The woman making a margarita for a dine in guest stuck her bare, unwashed hand deep into the lime bin on the customer salsa bar, touching numerous lime wedges on the salsa bar to grab one to use in making the drink.  She didn't use the tongs that were present there in the container, but stuck her bare hand down in it.  I hope the manager of this location revisits food safety and procedures with staff as well as need for consistent quality of items going out the door.  Please get the quality, consistency and cleanliness back to where it should be...I want to LOVE Senior Taco again and specifically this location..."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great! The rolls where ok. Nothing too thrilling. I had high expectations for this place due to the reviews but It was just ok."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Best fast food Mexican joint around, blows filibertos out of the water. The homemade horchata is to die for.."}
{"text":"So, yes the food is good and the prices were very reasonable. The Surf & Turf Taco was scrumptious. The special white sauce is a mixture of mayonnaise and sour cream. The fish taco was ok, but I'm not a fish taco lover to begin with. I also ordered the shredded beef flauta... The beef was excellent tasting, but the fried tortilla outside was very fried, very oily, so I peeled it off and just ate the beef. The place looks clean and the staff is relatively nice."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's definitely our GO TO place for breakfast and lunch! It's right close to our work so it definitely has become our place to go to when not sure where to eat for lunch. We love their burritos - it's large and very filling. Their rolled tacos are good and one of my new fav is the green chili burrito. I also love that they have a little bar that you can grab some pickled carrots to go along w/ your to go order. Their drive thru is a bit hectic but everything is made to order and their food is good so I think it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I had the Chile Verde burrito and it was slightly disappointing. Plus they removed the lunch specials. Other than that the service was good and all the other menu items I have had have been pretty good for a fast food Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"I had the California burrito...legendary! The tostadas and tacos are huge. My new main mex food joint."}
{"text":"Worth the wait in the drive thru. Vegetarian/vegan options. Love the veggie burrito without cheese. Huge!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican places! My favorite is the grilled chicken chipotle burrito. Be sure to also try the marinated onions. The best place to go for quick Mexican food."}
{"text":"This joint is as advertised...  Delicious and  cheap the carne asada fries are tasty.  This is a fast Mexican joint that you can eat at and not regret the choice ten minute later!  Shout out to my favorite employee Liz, thanks for looking out for my gluten allergy."}
{"text":"I take my Mexican food very seriously... and seriously, this is better than Chipotle. 
IT'S. THAT. GOOD.

Oh heavenly burritos, I can hear you calling my name. Not sure what drugs they put in their sauce, but I'm addicted to it (Chipotle/cream/sauce? I don't care, its AMAZING). All the portions are large and filling, the people behind the counter are always helpful, and the place is clean. 

The salsa bar provides a wide variety of flavors and spices. The menu has something for everyone, everything I have ordered has always been delicious.

Senor Taco, thank you for making my taste buds do a happy dance every time!"}
{"text":"Outstanding \"fast food\" mexican restaurant. Two words, beef tacos. The tortillas are like something out of a story book. Their sauces are delicious. Good amount of meat and cheese and soooo mouthwatering. Grew up right down the street from this place so I have many friends that have been there and they all absolutely love it. Get a breakfast burro in the morning and taco's for lunch and be happy to go back for dinner. If you're not eating at senor taco or la fonda's in scottsdale you're missing out on very good cheap mexican food."}
{"text":"Really good food. Pricing is excellent. Had no bad experiences. Excellent Mexican food"}
{"text":"Oh man, this place rocked in all respects to Mexican food! Fili and all the other \"bertos\" have something to fear! 

Simple review: everything tasted fresh, was well portioned, and all in a nice and cozy atmosphere. Oh, and must I say that the red sauces actually tasted like something! I will return on many more occasions."}
{"text":"This new taco shop was very clean. I had the fajita burrito which was very good and filling. my wife had the # 1 combo which was a taco and enchilada. Both the flour tortilla in the taco shell was very fresh as well as the vegetables and meat. I like the salsa bar with  the spicy onions and carrots. The salsa itself was okay. Bon Appetit."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food place in this area it's quick affordable and everything always tastes great"}
{"text":"Had the menudo was mostly just soup not worth 8 something a bowl! Maybe if they put more hominy and tripe it would be worth that much. But what do I expect for a fast food menudo !?"}
{"text":"Food gets 4 stars for affordable and fast Mexican. Cashier service gets a 2. 

We frequent this location a few times a month and for the past several months service isn't what it used to be.   The cashier should be friendly, and usually we aren't greeted warmly, or even with a smile.

And, as patrons of a restaurant we should not have to ask for tables to be wiped down. The last 3 times we have visited, we have had to do just that. Yesterday afternoon was no exception. What's more we were asked which table should be wiped down. Hello! They are all dirty so please wipe them all down!!

I can understand if there is a long line, but when there are no other customers waiting to order and all 5 of the open booths are dirty there is no excuse to grab a clean rag and wipe each table off. It's unacceptable and cleanliness should always be a priority. Always. 

Writing this for management to be aware."}
{"text":"Gross. Another desperate attempt to eat after waiting too long. A friend told me this place is good. He must secretly hate me. This place is a joke. They should close their doors. Carnitas burrito was literally dried up nasty chopped pork with zero flavor. Zippy. Nada. It was an oversized tortilla with pork and a tiniest little bit of guacamole and like maybe a piece of a tomato. WTF are you selling as a burrito. There's a sign that says the \"wait is worth it\". This is what is defined as a bold faced lie. Fuck this place, DO NOT EAT HERE. It really can't be any worse. Well I guess it could."}
{"text":"carne asada fries! fully loaded nachos! the grande breakfast burrito! these are the awesome things we get and split between myself, the husband, and a 3 and 1 year old. it's more than enough food to satisfy all of our appetites as well as any mexican food craving. i totally dig the salsa as well. it's nice to go somewhere and feed an entire family for around $10...and that includes a delicious horchata."}
{"text":"Feeling some Mexican food and we were planning on driving to a Mexican stand in Mesa but saw this on Yelp and decided try this place out. The meat choices were simple, chicken, beef, carnitas and shrimp. I was expecting pastor and tripas too, but oh well, this wasn't those authentic shops. 

We ordered:

Surf and turf burrito- really really cheesy but had shrimp on every bite

Chicken enchiladas- good 

2 carne asada tacos with rice and beans- it was ok, the meat didn't have the smokey grilled flavor, tasted like the meat was boiled and then grilled quickly. The rice and beans were good, had a smokey flavor on them."}
{"text":"It's a 3 star joint. They get a 1 star for friendliness. The cashier never smiled once. There was no one else in line at the time, so it isn't that she was buried with customers. I watched as others came in and ordered and she never smiled once. I didn't see any of the staff in the back smiling either except once when they were joking around with one of their own staff leaving. 

Their namesake is where its all at here. The tacos have a great shell and the perfect crunch. The beaf was cooked to perfection. 

The quesadilla is loaded with a lot of cheese, but if you are ordering one, I'm guessing you know that and expect it.

The enchiladas have a different sauce than most places. It was pretty good, but if your counting on the standard red sauce you get anyplace else, then this is not for you.

The beans and rice are excellent.

Chips: I got 2 chips on my plate with my meal. If you want chips to eat with your meal, they only have a large bag for $3.99 ($4). We would never eat all those. It would be nice if they offered half the bag for half the price.
The chips taste like the taco shells, which means they are great. You will love them.

The joint was very clean and well kept after when people left.

They have daily specials that give a bit of help for those on a budget ($5-$6). On average, meals will run you around $8-$10 if you don't eat off the specials.

Wish they had a little better selection when it came to combo's. They didn't have any combo's that include a burrito besides one with a shrimp burrito and it was over the $ price guide given by Yelp for the Taco Shop.

Overall, I still think 3 stars is about it for this location. If the Staff was more friendly and actually acted like they were glad you walked in, then I think this would get 4 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch with a coworker and we were both very impressed.  I had the #6 with a fish taco, Carne Asada taco, and beans and rice.  Everything was on point.  Fresh and flavorful all around.  My bien"}
{"text":"This location is okay but not as good as the one in Litchfield Park (gets 4 stars). 

I live half-way between both of them and depending where my errands are at in Goodyear/Avondale I end up at the two different ones. I have eaten their food at least 20 times:

-Rolled chicken taco special
-Chile Verde
-Carnitas (way better at Litchfield)
-Chorizo burrito
-Carne Asada Fries
-Enchiladas


It is my understanding this location on Estrella is run by the son of one of the Partners. He needs to be in his store more! Depending who is on shift, the food quality varies so widely. And the heavy set dude at night on the drive-thru needs to quit if he is so unhappy. 

They need to take notice because the Ramiro's down the street has new management and they have greatly improved and will give this location a run for it's money."}
{"text":"Friendly service from the cashier. The young lady that brings the food to the table could improve her customer service skills. The store is new and clean.

They serve breakfast but no coffee - that needs to change. We ordered a bean and cheese burrito and chilaquiles with eggs over easy.  Food were freshly made and tasty. Salsa bar has everything you need and they sell Mexican soda."}
{"text":"Drive through available, good service, clean restaurant and delicious food make a stop here worth it. Favorites here are the green Chilaquiles with two eggs over easy and the chorizo breakfast burrito with beans."}
{"text":"HEADS UP: I never dined in at Señor Taco before so this is based on my drive through experience. 

I've heard of Señor Taco for years but I've finally gotten the chance to try it out and I LOVE it! They've got you from A-Z, burritos and tacos, all the way to enchiladas and tamales! That's right folks, we no longer have to wait until Christmas for freaking tamales! The tamales come really hefty though; red sauce, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, lettuce, cheese and one tamale was definitely filling. I've been here twice and I really enjoyed the food. I had the California surf n' turf burrito, which included both Carne Asada and shrimp, and the delicious shredded beef tamales. I also really love their salsas, delicioso! 

Even though I enjoy their food so much, I have to -2 stars. Because based on both times I was there, I was in the drive through for a good 20-25 minutes. It didn't even seem so busy, for a fast food restaurant, I would expect it to be a little wee quicker than that. Also, I'm a girl that has a love for horchata, but the one I ordered from Señor Taco definitely was way too over cinnamon-y. Overpoweringly cinnamon-y! 

-2 stars, but eh, I enjoy the food enough to wait and order a soda instead of horchata every now and then. I remain a customer... I'm telling you, it's the tamales!"}
{"text":"This is place is awesome.


So they revamped this place this past year and definitely for the better. So i got a taco, 3 rolled tacos w/ guacamole, and a tostado for 5 bucks! 10% discount to midwestern students. Everything was delicious! (but maybe not the healthiest). Also a bag to tortilla chips alittle over a dollar for a huge bag.

Only problem is that this place isnt open 24 hours."}
{"text":"I live in San Diego, but my best friend lives in Goodyear. I LIVE for this place...I literally count the days until I can go back and have another burrito. 

My husband and I talk about this place all year round. Breakfast burritos every day while we are in AZ. At least once before we leave a surf & turf burrito. 

Headed back to AZ tomorrow...you will see me here....a LOT in the next few days! 

The chipotle sauce. OMG. I could pour it over everything I ever eat for the rest of my life. 

****HIGHLY RECOMMEND***"}
{"text":"Love this place, every time we leave happy, food and service awesome. They just need to put more chairs in dining room."}
{"text":"So this place takes a little longer than other Mexican food restaurants, but that's OK because the food is great! I've had the carnitas, carne asada, and steak and egg breakfast burritos. They have a salsa bar stocked with spicy carrots and grilled Serrano chiles. I wish their Diablo was actually hot, it's mild at best."}
{"text":"The Carne Asada burrito tastes awful. The used poor quality meat no marination tasted boiled but tortilla was good but that was it. You're supposed to marinate the meat with orange juice vinegar about three or four other things and char it  before  you can call it carne asada.
 I also ordered chicken burrito was not good at all only kind of seasoning it had on it was chili powder no pepper no salt no garlic no lemon no lime and poor quality of chicken that taste like dog food.

Please don't boil the meat it's gross! You might get away with it in a different area but you won't get away with it in Scottsdale we have a sense of taste expect not to get ripped off."}

{"text":"Our go to Mexican restaurant in Fountain Hills. Great quality & quantity any time of day or night. Love it!!  When family visits from the Midwest this is where they want to eat"}
{"text":"This place is awful. Worst customer service I have ever received. I made a call in order for tacos with no cheese as my husband is lactose intolerant. I got home and I was short 3 tacos which were for my sons dinner and my husbands had cheese on them. I called them told them I need the 6 tacos replaced as I was short 3 and had cheese on the other 3. They told me to return to tacos with cheese and drive back to pick up new ones. My husband arrives home with 3 tacos. They again shorted me 3 tacos and said their was nothing they could to about it. So I drove there 2x, made 3 phone calls, was hung up on after being on hold for 5 minutes them told I can not have my other 3 tacos that I paid for because I didn't have 3 to return. I will never return to the place and it's a shame.  Paid for  food I never even received and since I didn't have the same quantity to return I could not be given 3 rolled tacos. Therefore my whole family ate dinner at separate times and my son ended up with Cheerios and I still got charged for food I never receive. Awful awful poor way to run a business."}
{"text":"Great, simple Mexican food at a great price.  Staff is always friendly as well"}
{"text":"Food is good but customer service sucks. Today I waited in the drive thru for 10 min (I was the only car) and finally decided to leave. The ladies are always rude too"}
{"text":"They have ceviche and shrimp cocktails that I sometimes stop in for after the lake or river. Today we stopped in with the kids and ordered them a chicken quesadilla and side of chips to share.
We received what looked like 2 chicken and bean burritos and like a 5lb bag of chips. They tried to tell me it was a quesadilla. It was 2 sloppy greasy rolls piled on a bed of lettuce with sour cream and thinned out guacamole that you couldn't pick up and eat much less pull apart and share.
We had the kids all grab a fork and unfolded the things to pick out the chicken. We have enough chips to last the week now.
The \"salsa bar\" consists of a few bowls of anyberto's taco sauce and pickled carrots and such.
Kids are disappointed. I'm bummed now that I took the family there.
Place is a lot better when I'm drunk."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Best burritos that I've found in Scottsdale. Breakfast burritos and bean and cheese are my favorite. Great place for quick and easy authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I go there about once a week.  Carne asada fries are amazing and they're plenty big enough for 2 people.  Also good are the fish tacos, anything with carnitas or chile verde.  Way better than Filibertos across the street where all the meat tastes like its been boiled and left under a heat lamp for days.  If you're in the area and want good tasty authentic mexican food, this is the place.

As for some of the poor reviews i see, If you come here looking for ambience or great service, this probably isn't the place for you. It's just tasty food at a decent price.

One last tip: try mixing the diablo salsa with a little of the roasted pepper in oil at the salsa bar-Delicious!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for a quick lunch today, but I am NEVER going back there!!! I ordered the two soft tacos pictured on their menu (one fish and one carnitas). Halfway through the fish taco I bit into something hard...and big and long!!! (I think the smaller, hard stringy thing in the first part of the taco that I ate around was connected to it.) I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS WAS! It wasn't like a kitchen utensil, it was more like a flat piece of backbone from a chicken. Before they gave me my money back, they poked around on it with a plastic fork and decided they didn't know what it was.

I'm glad I didn't have to eat the carnitas, they looked stringy and HARD and weird.

The best fish tacos I've ever had were at Baja (fresh fast food) in the Los Angeles area of California: these tasted awful and were literally oozing mayonnaise. I know what great tacos taste like, btw--the best I've ever had were next to the bull ring in Tijuana from a little vendor on the side of the road there in the 1980's.

I can't believe I didn't vomit after that horrible thing that was in the fish taco. I'm just crossing my fingers that I don't go through a bout of food poisoning tonight.

UGGHHH."}
{"text":"Had the Hash Brown Burrito. To my surprise it had both sausage AND bacon in it!!! Bonus!!!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Worth dealing with the customer service that is in need of major improvement."}
{"text":"I have been other señor tacos in the state but this location wins every time when it comes to great service and food."}
{"text":"Ordered two burritos, both were tiny for the $8 and tasted like Campbell's soup wrapped many times in a flour tortilla. By many times I mean half the burrito was a folded up tortilla with Guac paste. Meat was low quality. Check that, dog food wrapped in a tortilla. Note: The folks I ate with are all from Mexico and were grossed out as well."}
{"text":"WE LOVE THIS PLACE!!  My favorite thing to order here are the tamales.  They are amazingly flavorful and moist and served wet with red sauce.  I also really enjoy their fish tacos and also the shredded beef tacos. My husband likes the massive burritos.  My kids love the rolled tacos, rice and beans.   The prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity that they serve.  This is more like a taqueria with a drive thru and a few seats inside with patio seating outside and not a full service restaurant.  The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Help is friendly and knows the menu.  For fast Mexican food, this is it.  Prices are reasonable also."}
{"text":"Since I also think this is a 3 and a half star experience, I'll split the outstanding star with Ali B.

One morning, I found myself pulling into their weird parking lot... so I call Mr H and ask him if he wants anything.  He tells me \"No thanks, I've already had my coffee\".  \"Alright bro, next time\", I replied as I hung up, wondering if he actually heard that I was at \"Señor Taco\"

Then I called my boy A-A-Ron, catching him before heading into the office, and asked if he'd like something from Senor Taco (since I'd heard him and Paddy talking about their breakfast burritos the week prior)

\"That's a 10-4 good buddy\"

I've previously been to another Senor Taco, but never for breakfast.  Although I contemplated that the $6.49/ea price might be a little steep, I slapped down a Jackson, while under my breath in a falsetto, I sang \"I'm sorry Ms Jackson, I am fo reeeeal\"

I was pleasantly pleased by the girth or weight of the to-go bag.  I didnt know any lyrics that mentioned \"girth\", so I just falsetto'd out a \"this bag's gotta lotta giiiiiiirth\" as I bounced like a wrecking ball

Both Aaron and I sat in silence, he with his chorizo and I with my machaca, occasionally glancing at each other during chews, exchanging a satisfied head nod"}
{"text":"It's really good food if you order the right thing but man it takes absolutely forever to get your order. We have been here probably 15 times and even when it's not busy it takes a good 15 minutes to get a burrito.

The California surfin burrito is about the best thing you'll ever eat."}
{"text":"That was some damn fine Fish Tacos and Shrimp Burrito.

We always pass this place and assumed it would be like a Del Taco but it's not. Top quality stuff here. Huge Burritos! Loved it.

The only thing they need is something spicy. It's just gringo spicy right now, some of us Gringos want REAL spicy. 

You guys should add a Habanero salsa or something as an option ;)

Great grub."}
{"text":"Good food but bad customer service... very rude staff. The food is consistently good though."}
{"text":"Suggested to try this place a LONG time ago, and just never had the craving for Tacos since we make them at home a LOT.   Now the BEST Tacos are the ones made at home or street food vendor in Mexico,, but in Mexico no Cheese.. lol,, 

So far in the valley I havent really found a GO-TO place for Tacos, where I would drive out of my way to get my fix on.. That being said, everywhere has , ehh OK, tacos.. not to hard to make.. 

So we got Beef and Carnita Tacos to test the playing field.. By far (so far) these have been my favorite, with the meats being cooked but not dried out with very mellow seasoning and just enough cilantro n onion on a couple Corn Tortillas,,, 

This has been added to a new tradition we are doing Fried Chikn and Taco Tuesdays,,"}
{"text":"First time eating there and girl who took my order Jackie with dark hair  was really helpful with what to order.  I really appreciated her patience, everything was delicious. Regular tacos were amazing.  Rolled tacos, perfectly topped with guac and cheese, and had to splurge with the Carne Asada. They were delicious. Definitely winning the taco game in Goodyear/Avondale.  Thank you!!!! =)"}
{"text":"Wasn't a fan, food was pretty bland. Salsa was horrible more than likely i would never go back to this place again."}
{"text":"Drive thru is a wait but my fault since I don't want to go in. Prices are kinda up but I am too lazy to cook myself. Heh, I guess I am not the only regular. Both cars in front and behind turned off their engines... Glad they are here on my lazy days!!!! Thanks!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I eat here at least once a week, either for breakfast or lunch.  They have awesome food and the breakfast burritos are super huge.  Their Taco Tuesday deals are awesome as well.  $1.00 for street tacos, can't beat that price!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh Mexican food, kind of like Rubio's but not as generic. It was very clean, and had a nice casual atmosphere. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This building used to be a Big Burrito, which had terrible food. We were hesitant to try Senor Taco, since it sounded like your run of the mill fast Mexican food. I am so glad we took the chance!

They have a huge menu, and everything we have tried so far is delicious! We had the Diablo Shrimp Burrito which was phenomenal; we also tried the Chipotle Chicken Burrito - amazing! They even give you a side of chips with your burrito. The rice and beans were awesome - and the beef tacos were just as good! 

The customer service is a lot better than what you would find at Filibertos or the like, and the prices aren't bad either. We have officially found our new drive through Mexican joint!"}
{"text":"We don't live around here, but we're in the area so decided to try it out. First - the food was amazing!!! The shrimp soft taco had the yummiest sauce! And the carne asada soft taco was also delish. One problem was that I asked for double beans instead of rice and when I drove away and opened my container, there was rice. Bummer. Also the wait time was a little long. But I was happy there was a drive through! Overall decent experience, just annoyed about the rice."}
{"text":"So I have been here twice now and both times I got a burrito. I can't remember the which kind I ate the first time but the second time I got the Surf & Turf burrito. THAT thing is a beast filled with steak and shrimp, as well as your usual interior fillings. The burritos here are so large that it is really hard to eat the whole thing plus any chips or drink. They are decently priced, I think my burrito came to a total of $9-$10 which isn't terrible since it filled me up to the brink. The staff seems friendly and the owner likes to drop in and make suggestions to people in line which is a nice touch. I definitely plan on going back when I'm on that side of town again. Just dont go in there and expect to eat light."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Ordered the enchiladas combo plate and specifically ordered chicken tonight. When my meal came, the counter person who took my order proceeded to argue with me that I ordered cheese enchiladas. I have never eaten a cheese enchilada in my life. So, I basically did not get to eat dinner tonight because it went in the trash."}
{"text":"I judge Mexican Restaurants by their bean and cheese burrito. If their beans are good, and don't taste like they're from a can, you've found yourself a winner. Señor Taco has passed the bean and cheese burrito test with flying colors, delicious beans. However, the REAL jewel of the Señor Taco menu, is the Carne Asada burrito. Tender, flavorful meat, super fresh pico de gallo and guac. It's amazing. Service was great, super friendly employees, place looks super clean...I just can't complain. I can't wait to try their breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"So far, so good. Enjoyed my first and second visits to Señor Taco. The staff was friendly. There was a little communication issue during ordering, but that's not a bad thing. It wouldn't be a true Mexican taco shop if there wasn't a little initial confusion.

Service was a bit slow on the first visit, but much faster on the second. The food was great, the salsa bar was solid and there was plenty of seating, indoor and out. There were even some easily accessible electrical outlets on the wall left over from a previous tenant. My only true objection was the late afternoon sun that blinds west facing diners.

I noted another reviewer complained about the cost. Didn't seem that unreasonable to me. In fact, use of the $5 specials and Tuesday deals could make it downright cheap.

There are plenty of traditional style taco shops in other parts of the Valley. But not here. A nice addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Carnitas tacos and burritos are amazing! I have tried quite a bit of the menu and everything was good, but I now get the carnitas tacos every time."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast burritos in the valley! Always a good experience. Definitely my first choice for breakfast. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"I love the horchata & burritos here!!! What I don't like is their service time and that one way mirror at the drive thru!!! I hate that feeling of being watched and that someone is doing something wrong on the other side!!! Their is nothing nice about them in a drive thru and it's totally not customer service like! Get rid of it!!! But still good food..."}
{"text":"The food is good here but there is no reason a person should have to wait a half hour in the drive-through to get their food. I've pretty much lost my appetite. This is absolutely ridiculous and I still haven't gotten my food yet. Been exactly 30 minutes...and still counting...... final update...so it ended being a total of 50 minutes in the drive thru and there was only 5 cars in front of me the whole time!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Terribly slow service. Every time I go thru the drivethru I can plan on waiting 20 mins or more."}
{"text":"Longest wait in a drive thru ever! We got in line at 10:30 on a Sunday morning. 48 minutes later we received our 2 burritos. The burritos were excellent so that made up for the long wait. But still it was ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Pork carnitas tacos are my favorite, followed by the chili verde stew! Good portion sizes for the price."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise, we shared the new chicken Cesar salad and the pork carnitas plate. Wow, both were generous and excellent. A great value and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Omg tacos were amazing shrimp tacos are bomb ass heck would definitely come back next time I'm in az"}
{"text":"Feeling like a burrito fix or craving anything off a \"Bertos\" type menu?  Senior Taco is your place if your in the area.  Consistency, huge portions, and affordable prices have made Senior Taco a stand out amongst Fillibertos and other Berto type joints.  My wife is a vegetarian and can always order custom burritos, her go to is Egg, Potato, cheese and guacamole.  I went with the Asada Nachos which is a monster portion, could easily feed 2 people.  Don't forget the caramel filled churro, best enjoyed hot!"}
{"text":"Keep coming back for those shrimp tacos ! Yum Yum , to bad I am only here for half a yr."}
{"text":"Three stars because it's not good or bad. Pretty standard.  Getting our food the Saturday we were there took longer than I would have liked, but no real complaints."}
{"text":"Just good food. The half size carne asada fries is so good and can feed a large individual."}
{"text":"The Scottsdale Northsite location has become our favorite go-to spot for anything wrapped in a tortilla! Street tacos on the weekends are"}
{"text":"The food at this little place was great. Had the rolled tacos with beef tamale and the food tasted fresh. The prices was also fantastic. Lunch for 2  was  cheap and it was a good amount of food as well."}
{"text":"I was really surprised with this place. We stopped to give it a shot since we pass it everyday. The food was delicious. The señor taco burro was HUGE and I don't mean chipotle huge I mean 2 chipotle burritos huge. The flavors were perfect. I can't believe I didn't eat here before now."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito was dry. Plus they say you get four items with your make your own but they gave me bacon when I clearly said sausage, egg, potatoes, and cheese. Have them repeat it back to you if you phone order because English is not their first language and there may have been a misunderstanding. But when I called she didn't even care and hung up before I was done. Skip the attitude if they mess up and make your own burrito at home. Two stars for the horchata. It was the only thing not messed up."}
{"text":"The food here is the best. I have not eaten anything that hasn't been good. Friendly staff. And if you need something done a little different no problem."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I just stopped by here for burritos before we head on our drive home. We have been here once before and I got the same thing as last time: grilled chicken chipotle burrito. It is a burrito (fancy that!) with grilled chicken, beans cheese and chipotle sauce. I remember it being really good last time but now my tummy hurts as I type this. I may have just eaten too much though. Overall, the place is cute, but the burritos are slightly pricey (my burrito was $6.99). For two burritos, it was a total of $15."}
{"text":"I kinda sorta love this place!  Honestly, I can't quite put a finger on why... but the small family owned look and feel and the consistent quality and taste certainly help!  

!Yo quiero Señor Taco!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. I been to señor taco a several times. I had the fish tacos and shrimp quesadilla (my favorite) and some rolled tacos. The only thing I didn't like about this place is that there is a looooong wait. If you don't mind waiting then there's nothing wrong. 
Great food....long wait."}
{"text":"Best FISH TACO EVER! For fast easy and cheap Mexican this is your place! I have never had a bad experience here. I know it doesn't look like much but it's great! Ok. It's not super authentic but, it's enough to hit the spot! The portions are huge and everything is made fresh to order. The tacos and the enchiladas are the best and they have a lot of great specials on Tuesdays! A for sure Mexican takeout to try! Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"How have we lived in Goodyear for a year and never tried Señor Taco? We fixed that tonight and let me just say yum! My husband and son ordered the chile verde burrito chimichanga style and both agree that it's the best burrito they have had on the west side. I ordered the carne asada fries. First of all the portion size is HUGE! I could probably make 3 meals out of it! Not only was it big, it was delicious. The meat was super tender and flavorful. The fries also had beans, sour cream and guacamole. 
Yes the service was a little bit slower but think of it more like a restaurant that fast food and it might not seem so bad. I am anxious to try something else next time maybe a chile Rellano burrito chimichanga style. Mmmm. Always happy when we find a new favorite."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints, the food taste fresh, and hot, this is by far my favorite Mexican food place in town and im a native to Arizona.  The California surfin burrito is my favorite.  The horchata is the best in town. Try the cinnamon chips!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite. I'm a fairly picky person and they don't have what I eat at Mexican restaurants- taco salads or ground beef in tacos/enchiladas. I tried a chicken rolled taco with cheese and it was basically a tómale with cheese on top of it. The salsas were not very good (I tried the green and a red). The prices are good though- if you do to-go and get chips, it's a huge bag that lasted us days to eat- and they were good. My boyfriend liked the food I brought home even though I didn't. They also had fast service and are always looking like they are busy."}
{"text":"Great service, clean restaurant. If you want fast Mexican food, this is a good choice. Not everything on the menu is amazing though. Try the carne asada fries, they are so freaking good."}
{"text":"Ordered the fish taco lunch special. The service was okay. The combo came with refried beans, Mexican rice, 1 fish taco and a drink. They do give you 2 white corn tortillas. So you can make 2 tacos if you wanted to put in the effort like i did...it was messy but i did it. Wish fish was better, maybe i just happened to get the skinny over battered piece. All the other ingredients tasted fresh and good.  I'll try something else next time."}
{"text":"Have eaten here three times, never disappointed!  I have a Taco Bell around the corner from me, I will never go there again, so glad I found this gem close to me!! I waited in the drive thru for about 20 minutes Saturday night for nachos....well with the wait! VERY GOOD!!  Highly recommend for good Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Seriously - I haven't posted a review yet?? This is my go-to Mexican food place! Not particularly fast, but cheap, and great food!!! Everything we've had has been good, but it's the rolled tacos that bring me back more often than anything else. Love that perfect crunch, and the guacamole is really nice - not overpowered with complexity so you can actually taste the avocado! The cheese crisp is HUGE and absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"This was my first time and the service was very good. I got a large order to go and it wasn't a long wait at all. I had tacos and my husband had the California burrito which he said was very good, I have two tacos and nachos with a side of rice and beans. I thought the food was flavorful and the price for all the food was very affordable. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"I went in to Señor Taco tonight Sunday at 6:45pm with my 5 year old daughter. Another customer walked in about 30 seconds before myself. When I walked in many customer were still sitting down eating and a few waiting for food. My daughter noticed they had orange Fontana and was super excited to try it. The woman at the counter finishes taking the order of the customer in front of me and then says to me \"were closed\" I said \"it says the restaurant closes at 7pm\" and it was only 6:47pm now. She says to me \"Well I have other people to serve\". She denied me service and my daughter started crying because she was so fixated on trying the orange drink. The woman did not care. How rudely I was treated. The big OPEN sign was lit the doors were open and it says open till 7pm not 6:30 or 6:45pm.. I will never ever go back to this place due to this horrible experience. I will also make it a point to tell those around me my experience."}
{"text":"The food was good, also I saw the bands Young the Giant and Holy Child here so that was pretty cool... Also you haven't lived until you've eaten their hot carrots"}
{"text":"It is edible, but not great. The meat tastes & feels boiled, so it is pretty flavorless. The salsas are okay, but even the diablo isn't very hot. The plus is the portions are huge and the refried beans and rice are pretty good."}
{"text":"Great food! Can't believe it's fast food. Been a long time since I've had great fish tacos like they are in cali."}
{"text":"Much better than Filibertos. Had lunch with my wife. She had Cheese Enchiladas with side of beans and rice. I had Chili Verde Burrito. Both tasted fresh and were excellent. Their Tomatillo salsa is great. I just wish they were open late when I get off work and crave Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great little taco spot.  Really good service, prices are decent and I love the salsa bar as well. 

The customer service actually won me over but the food is legit. Mexican food is one of my favorites if not my favorite place and for a quick little fast food joint this place can't be beat.  Do yourself a favor and try this place out today."}
{"text":"This place is a solid taco stop. A huge step up from other fast food Mexican/taco shops, but the prices are so affordable! I tried the chicken enchiladas and would order them again for sure. The pepper/salsa bar is a nice touch for customization. Also, I love that they serve their breakfast all day as I'm a sucker for chorizo, and I'll have to try the breakfast burrito next time!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get burritos.  Their shrimp burritos are fantastic!  I steered a coworker to Senor Taco for their shrimp burrito and now he's hooked as well.  I will admit that they are lacking consistency because there have been days where the burrito was dripping as soon as I picked it up and other days it was as though they didn't put anything but rice and shrimp in it.  More often than not, they've been perfect.  I also love their breakfast burritos.  I find them to be very filling and keep me full through a good portion of the day.  Ordering through the drive-thru isn't too bad as I've not experienced any mistakes with my orders.  I do wish that they were open an hour later so I can pick up a shrimp burrito on my way home from work."}
{"text":"Good little taco shop right in the neighborhood. I believe this is there a location. Very fresh flavorful ingredients made to order. The staff is attentive friendly and knowledgeable. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome beef taco. Not in love with enchiladas (too tomatoe). But also enjoy shrimp burrito ----best Mexico food on area --wish they were open later"}
{"text":"The food was terrible. I ordered a chicken tacos combo and the taco was so bland I couldn't believe it came from Mexican restaurant. The beans had a tart taste and the rice was bland as well. How this place has 4 stars is beyond me. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"First time here, surprising legit! I ordered a carne Assad taco and rolled beef tacos. Well prepared Calif style and goodsurprised me! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I am addicted shrimp burritos. I eat shrimp burritos whenever I get the chance and they have the best! Very large portions. Really yummie chips made in house. I really hope they open another location, but until they do, I make the drive for their food! Nice place to go for lunch and sit outside or grab dinner to take home."}
{"text":"Fast. Delicious. Affordable. Nice staff. Had the fish tacos and was not disappointed. They're pretty big, but manageable. 2 would be plenty for most people. I'll be a regular here now."}
{"text":"Update review. Since my last post things have changed for the better. The restaurant is cleaner, the tv has been on music station and you just feel good coming in again. The food has always been good and remains so as of today."}
{"text":"Great tacos. Had the surf and turf it was amazing Very filling could probably feed 4 to 5 people"}
{"text":"This place is so good. In fact it the only Mexican restaurant I've truly enjoyed since moving to Arizona a few months ago. I've had their taco combination plate, rolled tacos, quesadilla, carne asada burrito, & California burrito (one of the best burritos I've ever eaten, period). Everything was good, tasted fresh, authentic, and fulfilled my craving for tasty Mexican food. This is the best Mexican food joint in the area, hands down."}
{"text":"This is the best fast Mexican food restaurant in the east valley. I ordered the special #2 which is a carne asada burrito, three rolled tacos, and a drink. The tortillas taste as if I had just ordered a homemade one in Old town San Diego. I will be a regular here."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Had some really delicious chilaquiles that taste just like home : ) definitely coming back as often as I can. Great staff as well!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the first time. Tacos were excellent, salsa was excellent!! Nice little patio!! This is definitely our new go to spot for great mexican food!!! Can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"3.99 for 1 shrimp taco! Really?? Never coming back again until you reevaluate the pricing!"}
{"text":"Wow!  The food here is outstanding and authentic.  When friends come into town, this is one of the first places we go!!! Yum"}
{"text":"Nice, clean place with food served up rather fast.  Prices were reasonable, food was good, and plenty of parking in the adjacent Wal-Mart parking lot.  Only quibble I had was that the \"Diablo\" salsa was not at all spicy.  Come on, guys."}
{"text":"Contemptible customer service. They really don't seem to care about the actual customers who keep them in business.
They won't get another cent out of me.
Advise anyone to avoid this place."}
{"text":"I'm from California, and love a good burrito. I came to Senor Taco, and got an excellent one. Horchata was delish and the chicken taco tasty. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I came here the other day to have a bite to eat for lunch. When I got there the place seemed decent. After ordering my food I grabbed a seat at a very uncomfortable booth. What I ordered was A carne asada burrito that came with some tortilla chips. Once I was a few bites in I realized the burrito tasted horrible. I continued to eat it because well I payed for it! I got just over half way threw and had to throw it away because I couldn't hack it anymore. 

I DO NOT recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"There have been several other taco shops in this location over the past few years. None have fared well, obviously. We were happy to see that a Senor Taco was now in place and decided to give it a shot. We ordered a couple Diablo shrimp burritos, a quesadilla and a bean burrito. All were very good but the shrimp burritos are very obviously Senor Taco's claim to fame. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Went to this place on the Yelp \"Hot New Business\" recommendation.

For a Mexican Food Restaurant it was very clean and the people were very friendly.

Ordered the Carna Asada Burrito which had guacamole and Pico De Gallo and a few chips on the side along with the 5 Rolled Tacos.

The burrito was very tasty and a little smaller than filibertos. A good mixture of the guacamole, Pico De Gallo with the Carna Asada meat. The flour tortilla was also very good.

The rolled tacos were covered  with lettuce and Guacamole and very tasty.

The decor was a little better than a filibertos but nothing fancy.

There were posters on the windows for different specials and the shrimp quesidilla and Shrimp tacos looked very good and next time will try those dishes."}
{"text":"Since having legit Mexican food in CA over Thanksgiving weekend (Taqueria de Anda), I have been wishing for a place that good here...I finally found it. 

I feel that I'm pretty simple when it comes to Mexican food. The two things that matter most to me are the beans and tortillas. I personally feel that the tortilla will make or break the burrito. 

The moment I opened the package I knew I made the right choice. My burrito looked like a perfect pillow filled of beans, rice, and cheese. The flavors were on point -no salsa needed. The beans reminded me of my great grandma's, the rice was fluffy orange, and the tortilla was homemade. 

I know lots of people douse their food in sauces, but I do not. However, next time I look forward to trying their salsa bar with tacos. In addition to salsa, they have spicy carrots and onions for added flavor. 

Until next time -thank you for fulfilling my beans, rice, and cheese burrito dreams."}
{"text":"Spouse loves this place. I can't seem to get a hard taco shell that doesn't completely turn to mush within seconds. She loves it; I won't go back. Food isn't anything to write home about--sort of like a Baja Fresh."}
