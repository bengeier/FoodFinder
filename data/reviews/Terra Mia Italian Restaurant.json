{"text":"This Italian restaurant is a hidden gem which needs to be visited!! I am out from California and with the help of yelp discovered it. A must have the Penne Principessa and Terra Mia Bolognese two unique and flavorful dishes!! Their sauces are wonderful and their manicotti homemade woot hoo"}
{"text":"Tastefully decorated, good food, attentive service- almost empty restaurant at 6pm on a Saturday.  Delicious bruschetta appetizer- It had just enough onion and garlic to differentiate it from the sweet tomato bruschetta that has become popular elsewhere.  Excellent quality mussels with tasty broth.  Entrees were good.  Mom and pop operation run with care and love.  Will these guys make it?"}
{"text":"This place is closed, closed, CLOSED.

So disappointing, because I found it on Yelp, the menu sounded fabulous, and the website didn't give any indication that it was no longer in business.  But we went there for dinner (during their posted opening hours) and it was shut up tight.  Gone.

Note to self:  Always call ahead before driving over to these little Yelp finds."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian in Scottsdale Ranch!  We enjoyed our second meal last evening with friends that had never been to this estabishment.  The special chicken encrusted in parmesan was light and delicious served with house made pasta.  Our guests enjoyed the risotto and cleaned their bowls ... as previously mentioned the bread / house wine very good as are the house made desserts!  This is clearly a neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Great food. Ordered spaghetti carbonara which was not on the menu. They were happy to make it for me and it was delicious! The atmosphere is terrific. Murals on the walls are beautiful. Waitress was attentive and knowledgeable. Like an earlier review said, the chianti was really good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We recently had dinner here and it was wonderful.  This is a hidden gem tucked into a corner of the shopping center in Scottsdale Ranch.  You really feel like you are in Tuscany inside and the ambiance is very good.  Our server was excellent and the food was wonderful.  We both had the Tilapia Francese and it was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of light seasoning.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Ate there again and food really is good.  But service was terrible.  They were about 2/3 full and the chef got overwhelmed.  The owner who was also our server went back and cooked our meal!  Lucily he knows how to cook.  I think we will wait to go back until after the snow birds hit their nests again.  Too bad as we really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  We tried it a month ago and have been back 4 times.  The owners are very friendly and accommodating. The sauces for all the food are amazing.  The Cesar salad is great, too. The place is hidden in the corner of the shopping center in Scottsdale ranch. (the same shopping center as Goldie's).  It is relatively new, so there are not nearly as busy as they should be based on the food.  If your looking for a new Italian place to try, make sure you go by Terra Mia."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  To start, the bread/house wine is great.  The house Caesar Salad is also.  Authentic.  Flavorful.  Great experience."}
