{"text":"Tonight was the 2nd time we've gone in the past 2 weeks and both times were nothing short of a total disaster. We thought after the 1st time it was just a fluke when we waited for an eternity to get waited on and then the order was wrong. They offered to remake my meal but I refused because it took so long the 1st time and I didn't want to wait another hour. Tonight was the final straw. The waitress was prompt and friendly but, again, the food took forever to arrive, approximately 45 minutes and they weren't busy. We were about 30 seconds away from walking out when the food did come and my  cheese steak hoagie was fair, at best. The quality and quantity is not what one would expect. I did not complain about it but did about the time waiting. The manager came to the table and offered excuses, not apologies or saying the situation would be corrected. This place needs new management and kitchen staff. WE WILL NEVER RETURN!!!"}
{"text":"This review is for one thing only: their white pizza, which I only get in take out. I love it, it hits the spot when I'm having a craving.   Can't say for anything else, but I'm glad they are still here dishing it out. This place is a neighborhood institution. If the other reviews are true about the rest of the food being often not very good, then I sincerely hope they step up their game so they stick around even longer."}
{"text":"Great pizza and friendly atmosphere.  Recently got some craft beers available.  Much needed."}
{"text":"The salads were crisp with one cherry tomato, one pepperocini and two olives. Adequate for a side salad - one of ours contained a shard of hard plastic. Lasagna was horrible. Noodles and meat in the sauce were so soft you could not distinguish one from the other. The ricotta filling was dry. My husband's pasta dish was mushy. When the waitress inquired about how things tasted my husband told her the noodles were mushy and overcooked and she said \"Aw that's too bad. I was planning to try that for my dinner.\" We ate the bread. When the waitress came to clear the dishes she asked if we would like boxes for our basically untouched meals and we declined. She presented the bill and then 5 minutes later came back with another bill with one entree removed stating that she guessed it really must not have been good so she told \"her\" and asked that we not be charged for the one uneaten meal. I guess you have to pass the time test - take no bites - before they believe you that it is inedible. The food was absolutely horrible. We will not be back."}
{"text":"We go here a lot when I come back home. The food is good I get hungry from the aroma when I walk in. It's a good place for the whole family, many different options on the menu but we usually get pizza, Stromboli,  or calzones and pitchers of beer. They have a lot of tvs with sports on, a game room for kids and always plenty of seating which we need bringing 8-10 people. Always had good service. This used to be a kicking rock and roll bar when I lived here in my younger days. Never thought 20 years later I would be eating a nice meal there with my family. Lol"}
{"text":"If I could give Pizzaz no stars I would! The food is just so so. The worst part though is the horrible service which is made worse by even more horrible management. So bad in fact that I went out of my way to download this app just to write this review. I have now had two bad take out experiences with Pizzaz and today was the last straw.  They used to be good with pleasant staff. I often went to here with family and friends when i was a lot younger. This restaurant has just gone way way down hill. I suspect that inferior cooks and poor management may be to blame.  Today I actually had a manger there Diane I believe but I'm not sure (said she was the GM) anyway she actually hung up on me when I called to complain that my salad was wrong. She argued with me and finally said \"fine we will make u another\". What a joke! Who in the world would want to be treated that way when I am willing to spend my hard earned money to support their business. Never again. The food is marginal at best and overpriced $35.00 for a chicken salad and a plate of cheese ravioli. I guess our extra two cups of dressing cost a fortune or something.  Either way I would steer clear of this place. Rude staff and poor food just means a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Ok. I really don't know where to begin. Two weeks ago my husband and came here for dinner and it was a Friday night and extremely busy. At that first visit the waitress was great and the food was fantastic BUT the second visit we decided I being the entire family and boy did this place fail not only in service but food quality. Our food was cold and the service was extremely poor. We asked for our food o be reheated"}
{"text":"If compared to restaurants in Downtown, the Strip, and up-and-coming Lawrenceville, it wouldn't fare well.  But this family friendly comfortable staple of the South Hills has been here for a long time, and has a decent following.  It's busy most of the time, and driving by on a weekend night, the parking lot is usually packed.  We usually opt for take-out service, and our order is usually spot on. Consistent, Reliable service.  The food ranges from somewhat flat and boring to generally pretty decent.  The chicken parm is good, and the kids seem to like the ravioli and meatballs.  The Pizza is better than average, but there's so much nearby competition now: Harry's, Fiori's, Anthony's Coal Fired, and so on.  The prices are very reasonable, and the number of families that fill the place testify to the affordability.  The bar on the other side of the building has good separation, and is definitely both dimly lit and maybe even somewhat divey.  While I'm usually a drink-with-dinner-only type of guy, there's many more upscale places to go if you want to impress someone, want a more modern atmosphere, and generally want to overpay for drinks.  If you're looking for a decent place to relax, and grab a few beers in a low-key environment, then I could suggest it.  My out-of-town Brother-in-law and I snuck in here once during an avoid-kid-responsibilities outing when the wives had the reins, threw down a couple, ordered some basic bar food, and had a good time.    I'd rate this 3.5 stars if I could but can't in good faith give it a four.  With this being said, I WOULD recommend it, and you might be surprised to find that you can have a tasty, inexpensive meal, in a staple mom and pop in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 specials. The patty melts. They consisted of two pieces of burnt marble rye toast with American cheese melted on one slice and a burnt hamburger patty with some onions. Both specials were prepared the same way. On top of that the service was extremely slow, which is par for the course for this restaurant in my experience. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"So I have been coming here over the years and I feel like recently it has gone downhill the service is still good but the food not so much  The portions were a little small for the price along with not the freshest and best ingredients we would return for drinks but probably not dinner if you were to order pizza and wings that would be my suggestion"}
{"text":"Love PIzzazz. We try to avoid chain restaurants as often as possible, so Pizzazz is always on our radar. Good pizza, great wings (I always ask for extra well done, and they do it right!), and my wife loves the eggplant parmigiana. We had a holiday party for out hokey team there, and the were very accommodating. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"The past few times i was in this place it smelled like urinal cakes. Luckily, i got it to go. I ordered a bbq burger. They must of mistaken bbq burger for urinal cake slider cos it tasted like the place smelled. That happened 4 times. I dont eat there anymore. If you like pee cake burgers have at it, alot of people do apparently... judging by the crowd. Not for me."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times over the years ....when I was younger my buddy and I would go here all the time after a hard days work for some grubb and be totally satisfied ....NOW ....the last time I went was a HUGE let down ...The fish sandwich I had was gross ....extremely over cooked and over breaded My wifes food which was a small pizza with sausage was completely undercooked and doughy and gross .....I was really miffed by the change in food with all the previous experiences Ive had. The breadsticks we got for the app were still good and the service was still attentive and good so that's why Im still holding it up to 3 stars"}
{"text":"Pizzaz is a great little Italian restaurant.  I like going here because it seems like it is one of the only non-chain restaurants around.  One side of the building is a dingy bar, while the other side is a small little eating area.  The service was friendly and the food was good."}
{"text":"I will continue to come to pizzaz for their pizza which is delicious.. when they don't over do the crust and their sweet and tangy wings. I have unfortunately ventured out a couple of times from pizza and wings and got something else on the menu and it was pretty disgusting. If you are looking for an italian restaurant with food other than pizza I would head somewhere else. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, good beer, pizza and wings... this is your place:)"}
{"text":"A great place to take the family and or have a beer. The food is good and priced nicely with good portions. The service is good. Give them a try..."}
{"text":"Been coming here off and on for 20+ years. The food is decent. Some of the best wings I have ever had and fairly average to good pizza. However, the prices are outrageous. 1 large pizza costs $11.95 which is cheap but be aware of the fact that each topping adds $2.95/each. We added onion, green pepper, mushrooms and olives and the toppings cost almost as much as the pizza itself! And more expensive than an entire salad. Makes zero sense. If anything, you should up the price of the pizza and lower the up charge on the toppings. What pizza place charges almost $25 for a large pizza with a small amount of veggie toppings??  We went at a slow time of day (after the lunch rush/before dinner picks up) and the food took forever. The waitress was visibly stressed and seemed annoyed every time w asked for another glass of wine or grated cheese for the pizza. She also coursed the food incorrectly so we waited for soup and wings for over 45 minutes when all the food then came out at once."}
{"text":"The pizza is gross.. I love pizza, it's my favorite food, and have eaten so many different types of pizza. This pizza is by far the worst pizza I have ever eaten! My husband and son also agree. The pizza is very greasy, I had grease running down my hand, and there is hardly any sauce on the pizza. If it wasn't for the pepperoni, which was put on sparsely, the pizza wouldn't have any taste. I will never order from there again!"}
{"text":"The wings at Pizzaz are my favorite wings. I compare all other wings to these wings, and I consider myself a connoisseur of fine wings. I've not found any like them, on east coast or west. Only order the wings; don't bother with other food."}
{"text":"Tons of choices on the menu and the service is excellent! I had the chef special, which was shrimp ravioli in a tomato basil Alfredo and it was great! My fiancé had chicken parm with 2 giant chicken breasts and it was really good."}
{"text":"I dont think this place is worthy of 4 stars. This is a nice friendly family restaurant but I wasn't thrilled with the food. It has a history of being multiple restaurants over time and they display this history within the establishment. The interior is comfortable and a welcoming. The menu has a wide selection of items but I was told the pizza is the thing to get. The cheese pizza was good but the vegetable pizza was so so. The vegetable pizza dough was under cooked and the pizza was soggy with out any trace of crisp. The cheese pizza was a bout the same but had more crisp. I am not sure why the inconsistency between pizza but I was disappointed.   I would only come here if it was with a large group of people."}
{"text":"Food is okay, wait time is too long but the door service is absolutely outstanding! Greeters made it worth all 5 stars! Adds to the experience! Keep that up!"}
{"text":"I just recently tried this place because a friend told me the pizza is great. Well, I'm learning that my tastes are much different from my friend's.  The restaurant is nothing fancy and I guess you could call it a \"family type\" place. It does have a bar but I did not sit in there. The staff was also friendly but a bit on the slow side refilling drinks.  We had a pepperoni and mushroom pizza and also ordered some wings. I actually liked the wings and thought they were a above average. Unfortunately the pizza was very soggy. If it wasn't for that I would be giving four stars.  I'm not going to rule this place out just yet. I think we are going to try some hoagies next time. I saw several people eating them and they looked really good."}
{"text":"No idea why this place has four stars. Consistently greasy food. Ambiance nonexistent. Try to avoid."}
{"text":"Friends were gathering to celebrate one of our friend's birthday. There were 9 of us. We had a very nice young man who was our server. We ordered an appetizer platter, 2 anti-pasta salads, a Meat Lover's pizza and a Veggie pizza.  The appetizer platter came out first. It had garlic cheese bread, mozzarella sticks, mushrooms, onion rings, and maybe one other item. I was only able to taste the garlic cheese bread. It was very tasty-crunchy crust and soft inside. People around the table were happy with the other offerings on the platter.  Next the 2 anti-pasta salads were brought out. They were definitely a sharing size. They had lettuce, red onions, black olives, chick peas, artichoke hearts, shredded mozzarella, and a julienne meat. I think it might have been salami. It was served with 2 dressings on the side-Ranch and Italian. The salad was really good. The artichoke hearts brightened the flavors all mixed in the salad.  The pizzas were brought out and I tried one piece of each. The crust was a little soft, a little chewy, and a little crispy. The Meat Lovers had pepperoni, sausage, and a couple of others types of meat. The veggie pizza had tomatoes, green peppers, onions, and mushrooms. Being a \" meat & potato\" kind of girl I thought I would like the Meat Lovers more but I actually liked the veggie pizza better.  Some people ordered dessert but I was too full. The pies looked amazing and I believe are made in house. They had a big selection-Apple, French Silk, and a few others. They looked wonderful. Next time I will save room for pie."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant/bar in the area. The wings, sandwiches, pizza, Strombolis are all delicious. The service is fast and it is kid friendly. It's a great place for families. The bartenders deliver great service and it's a full bar. Recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"The only thing that was good was the waitress. The pizza is sloppy and bland. My girlfriend got the lasagna and it was stone cold in the middle and was probably made a week ago got it taken off the bill. The people sitting next to us sent food back also. Management didn't seem to care that the kitchen was sending out sub par food should've made a point to come over and check when food gets sent back. I feel bad for our waitress the cooks make the same no matter what she has to work for her tips and that's hard to do when the foods crap. Will never be back"}
{"text":"I've been going to Pizzaz for years.  Great pizza, wings and subs.  They have daily specials and their beers are resonabily priced.  Great to go their for sporting events and sit at the bar.  Also, great for families too."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and Italian food.  There are 2 sides to this restaurant...  1 side is a family style sit down and the other is a dimly lit smoky bar with bad haircuts and bad music. They may have passed the smoking ban by now (hopefully) so you can subtract the smoky part. Good prices on drinks tho. Dont drink and drive, the cops pull people over all the time on rt 19.  did I say awesome Pizza?"}
