{"text":"This is a cute little family owned cafe, so I feel bad leaving any disparaging remarks. I was craving a Belgian waffle for brunch but wanted something quick, so I thought it was the perfect opportunity to check this place out. I'm also a big dessert fan and try to make a point of visiting all of the bakeries. The desserts here didn't look appetizing and are not made fresh there, though they don't claim to be a bakery so that's fine.   What I really came for is the waffle, and the menu had a lot of options that sounded really good. My biggest issue is that the waffle was soggy, like an under cooked pancake. A Belgian waffle is supposed to be light and fluffy on the inside, crisp on the outside. For something that makes up the bulk of their menu, you'd think they would get it right. I found the apple pie topping also to be too sweet without enough apple chunks in it (it did not taste homemade). The ice cream on top tasted like the most basic budget ice cream as well. I was very underwhelmed by the food. The prices seemed a little high for what you get. The service was attentive and pleasant however."}
{"text":"Really nice place. Friendly staff, cool atmosphere. And most importantly I really enjoyed my food! We ordered a smores, apple pie, and cina-waffle.. One waffle would be enough to share.. They are huge! The smoothies were also delicious! I also took home an ice cream cake for my husbands birthday... It was amazing! Totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Always come here on my visits to Cleveland! Delicious as always. I recommend the French onion soup and waffles! They also sell bread and desserts. Will be coming back on my next trip! Wish they had this in LA!"}
{"text":"Heard this was an great place for a late Saturday night dessert. Great food and customer service, the waffles were amazing. Didn't have as many toppings or look like the pictures on the menu, but were still awesome! The atmosphere was definitely different. I was there with my girlfriend on a Saturday night ( mabout 11pm), & we were the only non Orthodox Jewish individuals there. We were eyed down quite a bit for sticking out, (as everyone was in their Orthodox attire) lol even the Rabbi was there! But, everyone was nice and the food was great so 5 stars!"}
{"text":"My waffle was overcooked by a bit and the floors were sticky.  I like the concept but I think I caught them on a bad day."}
{"text":"Love the place. Great waffles and smoothies. Great atmosphere. Great people. Great confections. Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Really nice and welcoming atmosphere. The waffles were really good and so was the hot chocolate. We were very full and it's nice to have a place to go to on a late Saturday night."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan. Ellie's is pretty unassuming. It's a HUGE space that serves candy, ice cream, waffles, smoothies, and coffee. I wandered in here after finding Ellie's on my Yelp app while finishing up a lunch meeting. Amidst a strip mall, this cute place exists on Cedar Road. I felt silly I hadn't noticed it before.  The coolest part about Ellie's is the waffle menu. I'm not sure where else around town does this. My Mom and I split the Lemon Pie Waffle and it was excellent. The dough had a rich, soft flavor that tasted only like homemade. It came topped with cookie crumble, lemon meringue and whipped cream. If I was seeking a late night snack on a Saturday, I'd come here in a minute - they're open until 11pm!  They also appear to do private parties. As I said, the place is huge. This could be a cute spot for a kids birthday party, though you'd need to bring in most of your own decor (the atmosphere is very plain). They also offer catering in the form of a smoothie or waffle bar, which is cool! How cute would a waffle bar be at a party? Ellie's is a family run business and is named after their granddaughter, Ellie. They care a lot about what they do! I would definitely stop again to try their coffee or ice cream."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Yelp and Google both said they were open (Saturday at 9p), but when we got here, their hours say 10:30a-12p. Was really looking forward to it. 1 Star for not keeping their info current on popular sites people go to for information."}
{"text":"I went in for international waffle day! I had the signature cinnawaffle with butter pecan ice cream!! I think my expectations were high considering the ratings but was a little let down. Ice cream was generic and waffle was soggy. Atmosphere was very fun and an interesting place... had cookies and other sweets but definitely not my place to go. Felt more like a fun house than the average cozy sweet treat places I like to go to.  Waffle was still delicious and they have WiFi so I got some work done."}
{"text":"I went to try this place on a friend's recommendation and the reviews on a rare off day.  It was empty inside with at least three employees, I walked around exploring before choosing the strawberry shortcake waffle presentation was pretty but taste was horrible waffle was soggy and doughy.  When how it was when paying to leave to told employee, I didnt enjoy it and why, was told to come back and try it again...no thanks."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious soups and waffles and wonderful service! Also love seeing the variety of baked goods offered. Would definitely recommend!"}
