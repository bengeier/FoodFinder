{"text":"Disgusting... The place has serious sanitary problem, and the food is just bad... Their beef pho is very bland and is composed of only rice noodle, soup, and frozen beef slices. Their \"special soup\" has a very weird taste and their chop suey are not even clean.

Do not go to this place."}
{"text":"Traditional Vietnamese Soups. Acquired taste so not the usual  dishes you'd find in a typical pho place. Excellent Bun Mam, the house specialty!"}
{"text":"My family alwasy come here for \"bun mam\" (salted fish soup with rice noodle). The soup is tasty and the portion is generous."}
{"text":"best soup i ever had period. it screams UMAMI. I love the flavour i have never tasted before, it's sour, sweet, spicy, the ingrediants are various which really shows that they care about there products. the service was very friendly."}
