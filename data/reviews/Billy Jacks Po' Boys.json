{"text":"This place is average at best. Came here since I work in the area kinda and read good things here on Yelp. I have to say it's just not that amazing. It was decent, I have nothing to complain about specifically but it certainly didn't impress me or blow my mind in any sort of way. I ordered the shrimp po boy sandwich and again, it was just very plain. Not much flavour and the breading was not tastey as well as the shrimp did not taste very fresh."}
{"text":"No reason for this place to be as empty as it was, even if it was a Wednesday lunch time.  There's great music that fits the atmosphere and cuisine but still fairly mainstream and accessible (maybe Zydeco isn't everybody's cup of tea, but Soul Man by Sam & Dave? Awesome).  Flying Monkeys beer on draft.  We had Po Boy sandwiches (Pulled Pork and Andouille Sausage) that were so good we forgot to share and sample each others.  We spoke to Billy Jack himself, and apparently he's just improved his BBQ sauce (which was part of both sandwiches - served on a ciabatta-style bread) that's been bringing people in more than ever before.  The Andouille sausage is authentic, and my wife said it was the best pulled pork she'd ever had, though I'm going to reserve judgement as I consider myself to be the bigger expert on meats.  Billy Jack is knowledgeable, intelligent and kind if you get a chance to speak to him.  We ordered garlic bread (not on the menu) for our 3 year-old who had just gotten out of surgery - we wanted to give him blander food just in case his tummy rebelled and they were happy to accommodate us, though apparently we could have ordered the biscuits as a side (instead of with chicken and gravy).  I can't wait for a chance to come back and work my way through the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Gnarly . . . if you're in the hunt for anything remotely resembling southern comfort food, . . . STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!  Po Boy Shrimp Sandwich  fresh shrimp? . . . not even close cajun seasoning? . . . not even close crispy? . . . not even close slaw? . . . not even close baguet styled bread? . . . not even close spicy southern style dressing? . . . not even close"}
{"text":"The standout of a recent trip to Billy Jacks was the crayfish in a spicy creamy broth.  Unfortunately the rest of the experience didn't live up to that first impression.  While our server was extremely friendly, there were some misfires like forgetting to bring us side plates for the crayfish (but he brought them for the table next to us who ordered the same thing).  Our entrees were the fried chicken, and an Oyster Po boy sandwich.  Chicken had a shake and bake feel to it, but the sweet potato fries were an excellent side dish. Lightly coated in a brown sugar batter, these were a big hit.  The Po Boy was fresh and stuffed full of oyster and bacon, but the choice of bread was disappointing. Served on a thick, hard crusty bun, all of the fillings were pushed out with each bite.   Don't get me wrong, Billy Jack's probably is, as advertised, the best Creole in the west end. But it's due to minimal competition - and that crayfish broth."}
{"text":"Had the crab cakes and shrimp po boy w/ tots & gravy. The presentation of the good could use some improvement but the flavour was definitely there. Service was excellent and restaurant was cozy."}
{"text":"Stopped over to this spot for a nice bite to eat here earlier this week. I'm a big fan of Po' Boys in general (the best I've had was at Hot Sauce Williams in Cleveland) .  Atmosphere  The place is small-ish, seating probably 25-30 people. At the time there was some Xmas decorations up. The booths are decent, fairly comfortable. There is a large bar which they offer up a handful of custom cocktails, bottles of wine and a few tapped beers. I sampled one of the house wines which unfortunately our server was not very familiar with (she didn't know what types of wine they were). My first request turned out to be gone as well.  Food  I ordered the classic fried shrimp po boy. The breading was delightfully crispy and fairly tasty and the accompanying shrimp was juicy and big. The bread of the sandwich was quite nice. I also got the bonus of getting my girlfriends bacon on the side to add to mine for even more flavor. Very solid po boy. Opposite me was the oyster po boy (sans bacon clearly) which was decent but not as good as the shrimp one. When we go back we'll probably try blackened catfish or something similar to mix it up. As a side I had the poutine, gravy was different, possibly pork based I'm not quite sure. Definitely didn't taste like standard beef gravy. I probably would not get the poutine again but they do have a good selection of sides. The regular house-cut wedge fries were quite good on their own.  We'll be back to check this place out again soon and try out some more stuff. Especially the jambalaya, really excited for that!"}
{"text":"I hope that they've improved since my visit to Billy Jack's Po' Boys.  To be honest, it has been a while since my less than stellar experience at their restaurant.    I was initially very excited to try it, being that sandwiches are one of my true passions in life, and I've always wanted to go to New Orleans and experience some of what are considered to be some of the best sandwiches on the planet - namely, the Po' Boy and the Muffaletta.  So, to say that I went in with high hopes would be something of an understatement.  Truth be told, I cannot remember exactly what myself and my better half ordered, all I know is that we were very disappointed.  The service was lacklustre at best, and the food sloppily composed and lacking in true southern authenticity and flavour.    Now, while I admit that I've never been to N'Awlins, I also know something of their famous sandwiches, and I must say that Billy Jacks Po' Boys sammies are far, far off the mark.  Ace bakery bread?   I think not.     As I say, it was some time ago that I paid Billy Jacks Po' Boys a visit, and, being that I live very close by, the fact that I have yet to return is a very good indicator that I was not happy with my first visit.    Overall: Food: 2/5 Service: 2/5 Decor: 2/5"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited this restaurant on the weekend. We both ordered sandwiches: catfish and pulled pork. I was confused by the lack of fish in my sandwich. There was a sliver of fish that didn't cover half of the base of the bread. My boyfriend was also not impressed. I think it was ridiculous to serve someone that and expect any kind of gratitude or positive feedback. Furthermore, why, if you are a newish place would you want to make such a bad impression on your guests? Also, sometimes I think people use the word cozy too often. I would not describe this place as cozy but just small. A fresh coat of paint wouldn't hurt."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a really good po boy sandwich and tasty hush puppies. Unfortunately I got neither. The large shrimp  po boy featured 6 small shrimp that were not deveined, on an enormous, stale bun and with brown, wilted lettuce which I removed. The tomatoes were clearly sliced hours earlier and therefore were not fresh looking or tasting.   I had to remove half of the bun.   The shrimp tasted ok but they were overshadowed by the avoidable flaws.   The hush puppies recommended by the server were weak at best and the gravy had a thin layer of oil. It ain't that hard to make a gravy that won't separate.   The only redeeming thing about my meal was the amazing street cut fries, which aren't even southern.  Nowhere near worth the $20 I spent.   Sadly, I'd rather eat at Popeyes.   Never again."}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere are great, but the food is just ok on average.  The mac and cheese is awesome, but the jambalaya and po boys are just ok.  I would come back though."}
{"text":"Unimpressed but the service was stellar. We started with crayfish in an amazingly spicy/lemony cream sauce, but unfortunately, even though crayfish season is in fact upon us right now, they seemed as though they had been previously frozen. There was a dryness to them when they should have been delicate. Perhaps they were just over-boiled.  I had the chicken fried steak which was gray and slightly tough underneath soggy crust that tasted suspiciously like Chinese chicken balls and a bland white gravy. My friend had the fried chicken, which he thought was slightly undercooked and tasteless.   Both of our entree's included garlic mash, which was dry and still had the skins on. I would have preferred fluffier mash, but that's just me.  I finished with beignet's which were obviously not made with authentic beignet flour, so subsequently were dense and chewy. Our server was excellent though. She was very warm, prompt, and not overbearing. I think this resto is probably a good addition to the Islington neighbourhood, but it would never survive downtown. It made me long for the good old days when Cajun Corner was still around!"}
{"text":"Chicken fried chicken had good flavor but it was so soggy because they put the gravy on top instead of on the side! It just absorbed into the potatoes and chicken and made the \"crispy\" skin just fall off the meat. Had half a crab cakes because they were so fishy tasting and dry, dipping sauce they came with was good though. Enjoyed the side of coleslaw the most sadly... raisins in it were a nice touch.  Would probably not order from here again!"}
{"text":"Caveats: I wasn't super hungry *and* I'd just returned home from a trip to New Orleans. The latter was why my boyfriend took me here, 'cause he wanted my opinion on how a restaurant he liked held up to the real thing.  It was bloody cold, as it has been, and it was chilly in the restaurant, but that's sort of de rigueur around the city these days. It's a bit divey, but in a charming kind of way. One thing that put me off immediately, though, besides the cold, which I forgave, was a strange smell. Kind of wet wood meets bathroom?  I ordered a fried oyster po'boy and we shared the beignets. There's more room on a grilled shrimp sandwich to talk about flavour. Oysters being deep fried takes subtlety out of it, so I can say that the sandwich contents were perfectly fine. Oysters a little tough but, hey, I know they weren't caught that day, so that's expected. The problem, though, was the bread. It lacked the true French, crunchy crust, and the dough wasn't sweet enough. It just wasn't the right kind of bread for the sandwich. I ended up foregoing the bread about halfway through, and just eating the toppings.  The beignets, however, I could barely eat. I had a bite, was a bit shocked, tried again, and gave up. My boyfriend tried a couple of bites from two, but also gave up. We left much more on the plate than made it into our mouths. Problems: super dense. Like biting into bannock (which, yes, I know this is a version of). The beignets you get at Café du Monde are full of air; you bite into them and you find great gaping holes. They also tasted like old oil, and the colour of the beignets was dark, so I believe they weren't using super fresh frying oil. Lastly, they were cooked through; there was no moistness or that verging-on-undercooked thing that should be going on. The icing sugar was good, though!  I wouldn't go back. Now on the prowl for some more genuine Southern food and some real Café du Monde-inspired beignets. Let me know if you have any suggestions.  p.s. If you haven't seen the movie Billy Jack, you should!"}
{"text":"Stopped by the place on a blistering cold night. I ordered the the jambalaya. It was well seasoned a decent size portion and paced perfectly.  Opted for the chocolate explosion pie which was even better than the main. It had the perfect balance of sweet and creamy  and the bourbon kiss was the thing that dreams are made of. I will be back and heck next time I may even order a po boy. Place is gone now Kpop"}
{"text":"i ran to my PC as I took my first bites of a fried oyster and bacon po'boy, with sweet potato frites and (the BEST I've had in Canada!!) caper remoulade for dipping.... very very good food, place has a great vibe, everyone is friendly, I can't wait to go back.... for a proper sit down meal of craw daddies...   HIGHLY Recommeded!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place when I saw that it had opened nearby. I finally went to try it out and I thought the food was average. The service was outstanding but that isn't enough to have me come back. The restaurant itself is really simple and plain decor wise. I didn't like that their bathroom smelled really bad either.  That's one of my biggest pet peeves about restaurants. When the owner or operator doesn't care enough to keep the bathroom clean, you have to wonder how much they care about the food they are making for their customers."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service but food overall was satisfactory. The fried pickles appetizer was delicious and had a nice \"dill\" kick to it. The pulled pork sauce was alright, and I found the hush puppies to be significantly dry. Overall the experience was \"alright\"."}
{"text":"Just. Awful.  The food here is nothing to scream about. Unless you are screaming from horror.   Food ordered:  - perogies - oyster po boy - shrimp po boy - sides: hush puppies & fries  1. The menu doesn't have complete descriptions. The perogies are topped with bacon (which my dining companion doesn't eat) and this was not mentioned on the menu. The waitress happily brought us another one, but it would be nice if the menu could properly describe the food.  2. The po boys were.. meh. The oyster was better than the shrimp but still nothing special. Could have made it at home better.  3. The fries were dark which means they were fried in old oil. Traditional hush puppies are smaller in size and round - not misshapen like these were. Looks aside the taste was off - missing that characteristic hint of sweetness.   The only reason I gave this 2 stars was for the waitress. The minute she realized we didn't eat pork products she ensured nothing else we ordered had pork in it (and even came back to tell us to order something other than the rice and beans since, once again, the menu didnt say it had sausage in it). She was a gem in this horrible place.   This place is not worth visiting. Save yourself some money!"}
{"text":"Came in on a cold wet April afternoon for a late lunch.  The restaurant has a jazzy New Orleans feel with tables nicely set with nice cutlery and linens. I had a bowl of clam chowder and a shrimp Po'Boy. The chowder was thin, more akin to a bisque with only a few clams. The base was creamy with a bit of a spicy zing. Not as expected for a chowder but pleasing.   The shrimp Po'Boy was disappointing. The bread was the major letdown, more like a hotdog bun than a crusty doughy baguette, cold hard tomatoes with standard mayo and a few plain deep fried shrimp with no flavor.    Still on the lookout for a good Po'Boy, didn't find it here."}
{"text":"If you like Southern Cajun style food you really need to eat here! The business is only 6 months old but you would never know. The service was amazing, the owner/chef was very passionate about his food and took the time to preview his new dinner menu with us. Minimal seating with a nice bar, we saw at least 3 people ordering take out, a few sitting at the bar, and the back booths were full. We sat at a front table which would have been crowded if anyone was sitting next to us.  Now, the food: we started with crab cakes which were absolutely full of delicious sweet crab, three cakes which were more than enough for 2, served with a slightly spicy and delicious remoulade. My husband and I both ordered Oyster Po' Boys with bacon. The oysters were plump, juicy, tasted like the ocean with just the right amount of breading. The po' boys are served on fresh baked buns with more of the remoulade and tomatoes, lettuce, and pickles. YUM!!!!! I had the sweet potato fries which were dusted with cinnamon and my husband had the chip truck fries, thick planks of delicious potato. Both fries were good but I wish I had ordered the chip truck fries.  All in all, a very delicious lunch and we're looking forward to trying the gumbo (they make theirs with crab) and the fish tacos, and the poutine, and the fried chicken, and the........!"}
{"text":"The clam chowder is one of the best I've  tasted and it has some secret ingredients that make it stand out from anything else out there. Don't miss the Crawdaddy's crayfish dish.    Staff is very friendly and attentive and the prices offer good value.  The close proximity to the Islington subway station makes it easy to get to."}
{"text":"Good food. Its heaviness sneaks up on you. Big on flavour. Considering the area, is a good choice. Haven't dined in but apparently there is Flying Monkey on tap. Delivery was great - came very late due to Valentine's Day rush, owner billy jack himself delivered it and gave $20 back. Got a \"pulled pork\" sample in my bbq chicken (8/10). Girlfriend got chicken fried chicken (8/10). Crab cakes (10/10) were the crown jewel. Very good fries/sides."}
{"text":"Really Friendly Service, small place but cozy. I really enjoyed the shrimp po boy and the beignets were delicious.  I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"I went last night with friends who live near Kipling Station; I did not even know about this place and hope we go again.    Despite being from the US, and having family roots in the South, I am really only familiar with this cuisine by name.  There was a lot on the menu to choose from and I went with the fried oyster and bacon sandwich with red beans and rice.  Delicious!    Now, if you don't eat animals, including fish, you will have a hard time here.  I think there were almost no options as the fried green tomatoes were not available.  The chef came out and offered to make my friend a special vege jambalaya.  Said friend enjoyed it; I was impressed that the chef came out to chat with all for a bit.    For a drink I tried the Hurricane, something I can't make at home as I usually only keep one kind of rum around at a time.  This was also really good and I can see how somebody could get bombed off these--they are sweet and go down easy.  The beer (tap) selection was good if that is what you prefer.  The atmosphere was friendly although Saturday evening was pretty dead--my guess is that this restaurant does 80% of its business during the day from all of the nearby office towers.    Service was fair.  Prices seemed fair too.  Neither of these would keep me from returning.  The cloth napkins are a very nice touch and added a bit of class.    This place obviously works for lunch or for a friendly dinner.  I could see it as a good dinner date spot if the both of you are a bit adventurous and want to explore dishes you can get just anywhere.  Very recommended!"}
{"text":"Like most people, we had fantastic service. Very friendly people running and working in the place, no argument there.  First impression on sitting down was that they need replace their table cloths. Dark blue in color, but various grease stains and even a couple tears in the material. Even with the nice white napkins, its hard to not notice. The good news is I rarely judge a restaurant based on their dining surfaces, but this is not a great first impression.  So on to the food. I had a Pulled Pork Po Boy with Sweet Potato Fries. The sandwich came on a nice baguette style bun, with a healthy amount of pulled pork, lettuce and tomato. Presentation looked good but I wasn't a huge fan of the pork. It was good, but a bit bland and lacking any specific flavour to make it stand out. Sweet potato fries were also a bit flavourless but had a great aioli type dip.  A couple choices of beer on tap, all Ontario brews. In the end a satisfying, but not necessarily impressive meal. I'll come back again, but won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Really good Gumbo and Chicken fried chicken. Not very good crab cake, porgies, or catfish. Service was great. Very personable. All in all good restaurant, not the best Cajun place."}
{"text":"Something about the neon and steel sign outside made me assume this would be greasy lunch joint with plastic everything.  Luckily, I was wrong!    It's actually a cozy and well-appointed resto/bar with classy touches like cloth napkins.  Service was friendly, including the owner/chef who seems to make it a practice to check up on patrons.  I ordered the blackened catfish poboy, which was perfectly seasoned and came with the best fries I've had in a while.  I'll definitely be back to try more stuff (especially the fried green tomato poboy).   Price was reasonable, considering the quality."}
{"text":"Average and Unremarkable. There aren't a lot of Cajun-specific restaurants in Toronto, so one would hope Po' Boys would have it together.  Wrong.   I had the Jambalaya, and to be honest - Zatarain's mix you can buy at a Grocery Store is better. It was like a soggy rice pilaf with chunks of sausage marinated in liquid smoke. Granted, I was comparing it to other Cajun I've had (Southern Accent in Toronto, and spending a lot of time in the South).   This is like a cookbook interpretation of Creole/Cajun Cuisine with a \"close-enough\" mentality to crucial ingredients.   Not impressed, and definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch at the suggestion of a fellow Yelper, and it was an absolute delight.  Grabbed a Pirate's Alley to drink, which was delicious and nutritious since it was liquor and fruit juice.    My meal was the fried shrimp Po'Boy, which was very nice.  The shrimps were battered and juicy, the bread was fresh and tasty, and the filling was great.  The sweet potato chips were divine.  I would slap the ketchup bottle out of your hand if you tried to desecrate them with that 'tomato' sauce.    Dessert was a plate of Beignets & coffee, which was very good.  Because we were at the end of lunch, the waitress brought me the whole French press instead of just pouring me a cup.    Plus. and this is a personal quibble, they have their phone # and address on the front page of their web site.  That is good news.   The owner/chef came out to talk to us after the meal, and he's just a peach of a guy. Seriously, if you want a nice cajun meal, this is a good venue.  Plus, it's across the street from Islington station, so you don't even have to worry about how to get there.  Huzzah!   Honestly, I'm a heartbeat away from bumping the score to five.  Maybe when I go back and try the jambalaya."}
{"text":"I visited yesterday for the first time for dinner. I really loved the food.   Got some great recommendations from the owner (sorry I forgot his name :$).   The chowder, chicken fried chicken and the beignets were delicious! The coffee was very good. I will definitely be back. It seems like a lot of regulars visit.   I am sure they are doing something. I now know where to go when I am craving something yummy and don't want to travel too far.   It is a small place but the service was unpretentious. I went alone and I didn't feel uncomfortable at all.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"On our first visit we really enjoyed the crab cakes and coconut shrimp as appetisers.   And for mains we had the jambalaya, gourmet mac n'cheese loaded and the gumbo.  To close out our dinner we enjoyed the beignet and chocolate pie.   We will return to experience more!"}
{"text":"Was passing by, and a friend and I thought we'd give Po' Boys a try....we were nicely surprised! Warm atmosphere, friendly staff...hearty, yummy food..perfect for what we were looking for!"}
