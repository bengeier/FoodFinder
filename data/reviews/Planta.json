{"text":"Really de-LISH! I was quite surprised that vegan cuisine could be so yummy, but Planta totally pulls it off! Inventive and creative dishes, and very satisfying, even for a dairy (and sometimes meat) lover like me. On top of this, a decent wine selection which complemented the food nicely.   The ambience, although cool and modern, I would think would not be everyone's cuppa tea. And the pricing was perhaps a little high (the wine list was definitely overpriced, but most restaurants do tend to mark up their wines)...however there is a lot of skill and labour that goes into vegan cooking, so I expected this to some degree.   Quick, courteous and attentive service as well, which is always a bonus! At times it felt a bit 'put on' ('yes ma'am, I'll get that right away ma'am') and I wished that our server could've just loosened up, however I get that this is their thing, and that they're trying to set a standard. And given the choice, I would much rather THIS style to the far too familiar apathetic style ( 'cool, no problem') that I get a lot of here in TO. So from this point of view, I really appreciated the service!  I'll say this: everything I bit into that night (frenchie pizza, chickpea fries, habibi salad, brussel sprouts, chocolate mouse) was a delicious and delightful surprise to my mouth, it all felt a little new and exciting...and I really thought that I'd tried everything in the way of vegan cooking (having been a vegetarian for many years and having tried most veg restaurants in the city). So for this reason alone I would highly recommend Planta! Hope this review helps someone!"}
{"text":"Tonight we did take out. We have ordered from here before. I got the \"hot dogs\" which tasted really good. However, the fries were SUPER WHACK! A complete disappointment. Typically, they have nice THICK cut fries. From the picture they seem to look okay, but they are over cooked; I can't even put my fork through them. And they are super thin. I can't even eat the other half of my meal. Soooo irritated. Paying all this money for mediocre fries!!!"}
{"text":"So overhyped and overpriced. The restaurant space itself is beautiful. The food is underseasoned, uninspired and ridiculously overpriced."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Planta for awhile so I took the opportunity to make a reservation when my boss told me to pick a place for the two of us to have lunch. I was a bit nervous because my boss isn't vegan and I'd feel bad if she didn't enjoy her meal but I was encouraged by the indication that the food was on the upscale side.       I ordered the Italian Job pizza which was a great choice. It's obvious that the ingredients are really fresh and the combination of flavours is so tasty. It's also large enough that you could share it with another person. I ended up taking half of it home. My boss had the macaroni bolognese and she thought it was flavourful and hearty.       For dessert I had the chocolate terrarium which was so good. My boss really enjoyed her avocado lime cheesecake.       Overall, it was a lovely dining experience. Delicious food, great service and stylish decor. My birthday is in a few months and I already know I want to have my dinner party here. I may try to stop in one or two times before then."}
{"text":"Amazing food, beautiful decor, great atmosphere. Just wish they would put their delicious French onion soup back on the menu"}
{"text":"Food was alright but the service was absolutely appalling! They forgot to punch our food in and then the floor manager was extremely rude in how she dealt with us. After an hour we got our food but naturally we were incredibly upset by the whole episode. I will definitely not come back given this restaurant does not care about its customers. It doesn't matter how pretty it looks!"}
{"text":"Came here for a special-occasion meal, and I wanted to love it, but I liked it.   We had the Cauliflower Tots, The Italian Job Pizza, and the Crab Cakes. The Cauliflower Tots were good, especially with a squirt of lemon. The Crab Cakes were excellent - tons of flavour and textural contrast, and I really liked the curried lentil or split peas they were served on. The pizza was underwhelming. It seemed like it was missing textural contrast and some toppings, specifically the fennel sausage listed on the menu, but our friendly server told us that the farro was supposed to be the 'sausage'. Farro wheat grains sprinkled on top of wheat crust didn't work for me.   Although I appreciate that the restaurant is trying to show the versatility of vegan foods and that fine dining doesn't hinge on serving food products from non-human animals, the pricing definitely isn't accessible to most people in the city. As someone splurging on a fancy dinner, I expected more."}
{"text":"Great dinner in a super sleek atmosphere. The cauliflower tots were my favourite! Erin was our sever and was 10/10!"}
{"text":"The vibe and the staff are great here which is why they get two stars. The food was not good. I eat a completely plant based diet now and this food is sub par at best. I ordered, the truffle fries, the soft shell tacos, crab cakes and the Planta burger. The truffle fires were probably the best item of the evening. The Crab cakes and the burger were under seasoned and had zero taste to them. The soft shell tacos were okay but very mushy and the sauce on top was nauseating. Overall I won't return or recommend Planta."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!! All unique dishes with great taste.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I couldn't help but want to test out the cute little spot on the corner of Bay and Cumberland.  While the food is impeccable and certainly well presented, the decor is what really makes this place special.  Everything from the cutlery to the furniture to even the staff.  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about this dishes so it helps to narrow down even though you'll want to try it all!"}
{"text":"Came to restaurant in search of a health cleanse and few shots for Instagram - was not disappointed. Place has great aesthetic : plates, bowls and cutlery were all beautiful. Decor and lighting made for a picture perfect lunch/ dinner. All the hype for photos!  However service was not all too fantastic. Was not greeted as we came in the restaurant, servers took their time chatting before finally leading us to our table. We were sat and left with the menus for a good 10 minutes before we realized that no server was going to take our order unless we called for one. Our finished dishes were not taken, refills on water were only given twice: midway and after our meal. Guests who'd arrived later and were noticeably older and richer were served before us.  We'd ordered the Watermelon Poke as our appetizer, the Habibi salad and the Planta Burger. Place is perfect for Vegans and while nicely plated, the food was not to our taste. Place is not recommended for those (like us who are) used to savoury dishes.  -Watermelon Poke was a great take on Poke Salad - basically replaced salmon with watermelon.  -Habibi Salad was served fresh with fried couscous balls (as we were guessing?).  -Planta Burger served with great fries and while the fries were perfectly flavoured, the burger was not to match. Was not easy to eat, kept falling apart.   Overall mediocre experience, not recommended for teenagers and those with a love for meat."}
{"text":"I wish I could speak on behalf of the food, but I wasn't able to fully enjoy my experience because one of my friends suffered an allergic reaction here last week. Last Friday, my two friends and I went to Planta for dinner: two of us ordered the Planta burger and my other friend ordered The Bianca pizza. My friend who ordered the pizza specifically chose this one because she is severely allergic to peanuts and nuts, and the other two pizzas on the menu (The Frenchie and The Italian Job) had cashew mozzarella listed as ingredients. All was going well, until my friend who ordered The Bianca pizza started feeling an allergic reaction coming on. I flagged down the first server who made eye contact and asked her if there were any peanuts/nuts present on this pizza. At first, she said no, but I asked her to confirm, since my friend was definitely having a reaction to something. She comes back and confirms that cashews were in fact present in the cashew mozzarella, which wasn't listed in the ingredient list on the physical menu, nor was it listed on the online menu at the time (the website has been updated as of SEP 11 to show cashew mozzarella as one of the ingredients on the The Bianca pizza). She swears that our first server asked if there were any allergies at the table, which was untrue, since our first server did not engage in conversation with us at all - she only took down our order.  A short while later, the Ops Manager came out, profusely apologized and gave me his contact to keep him posted, since my friend had to rush to the closest drug store to grab herself some Benadryl. He was nice enough to take care of our bills. Fortunately, my friend was able to resolve her reaction after taking Benadryl and having an EpiPen administered to her at a hospital. I took advantage of the contact info I had and emailed the Ops Manager the same night to explain the whole ordeal, hoping to bring awareness to the situation so that this would not happen to anyone else. The next morning I received a reply from the GM (who was not present that evening), apologizing for the incident, but also not taking accountability for the missteps that occurred the previous evening.  The GM replied, \"assuring\" me that cashew mozzarella was in fact listed on the ingredient list on the physical menu, but I can \"assure\" him that this is definitely not the case, since I have photos of two versions of the menu - including a screenshot of their online menu from the following morning - that do not indicate this ingredient on The Bianca pizza. The GM also wrote that they take a lot of care with allergies, because they \"deal with a tremendous amount of allergy requests.\" He even mentioned that our first server was anaphylactic to peanuts and that she \"takes allergies in general with her tables very seriously.\" This was very contrary to the way she serviced our table. We were all really looking forward to dining here, because we've only heard good things about Planta and the affiliated restaurants under CHG, but the whole situation was handled poorly by upper management. After the GM replied to my email, I replied back with photos of different versions of the menu - all of which did not list cashew mozzarella on The Bianca pizza. I also asked to have this matter escalated to someone higher up, as I felt as if he did not fully read the details in my initial email. I have yet to receive a reply since my last email, 4 days ago. After reading some Google and Yelp reviews, it seems as if this isn't the first time it has happened.  Side note: the burger was nothing special - especially for the price. It was dry and bland, and the patty was hard to differentiate from the buns. I've had a few vegan/veggie burgers before and all of them have tasted levels better than this one. The dish's only saving grace was the spiced fries and the yummy dip it came with. I'm a huge food lover and I hate complaining about restaurants, but I feel like something needs to be said here. Please retrain your staff to be more knowledgeable and thorough, and maybe I will consider stepping back into your establishment(s) one day."}
{"text":"They do the really hard things well (great food and excellent server) but drop the ball on the easier stuff (a friendly welcome).  It's so hard to find a vegetarian restaurant that does great food, and this one does. Our server understood the dishes, was great about helping us choose our order and the meal was great.  Once we go past the unwelcoming super confused clutter of the hostess station the rest of the experience was terrific."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I had heard a lot of hype about this restaurant and really wanted to like it. The restaurant itself is nice and had a DJ and the service was good. The food, however, was bland and super overpriced. I paid $23 for a regular portion of the most basic macaroni ever. The riddling like Riesling I ordered was too sour and my companion's beer was blah. Overall, very overrated. I feel like even Fresh has better food.   The only food item I liked were the cauliflower tots."}
{"text":"Came here for our 5th anniversary. What an amazing experience. Our sever Caitlin was the absolute best. She made our night perfect. We ordered the fried mushroom, the watermelon poke, the eggplant lasagna and the brownie. Everything was amazing. Upon our arrival, Caitlin knew we were celebrating and brought us a glass of sparkling wine. Everything was perfect!!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying the saving graces of this restaurant are its employees, their service, and the decor/ambiance. The food on the other hand, is just incredibly disappointing.   Visited with 3 friends this weekend, all with high hopes for a new vegan/veg restaurant to add into our regular repertoire. Alas, the food was nothing but cheap and unsuccessful attempts at veganizing traditional meat dishes. The sad thing is there are so many delicious original vegetarian and vegan dishes out there, but Planta is concerned with bridging the gap between traditional fare and the vegan world - to the detriment of flavour and edibility.   Cauliflower Tots (2/10) - how could you go wrong with a deep fried tot, right? Well, ask Planta. They managed to do it. This tot tasted like deep fried soap, plain and simple.  Chicken Fried Mushrooms (6/10) - probably the best dish of the evening, quite flavourful with a good dipping sauce. But that's probably because all you tasted was deep fried breading.   Pizzas (5/10) - not bad, but there are better vegan pizzas in the city. Really wished these were better!  Burger (3/10) - Yikes. Fell apart and tasted like a side of mexican black beans. Thankfully the fries tasted good.   Myself and my fellow diners are all quite familiar with vegan cuisine and had all hoped that Planta would deliver delicious original vegan recipes, but alas they quite disappointingly prove that vegan renditions of traditional foods are nothing compared to their meaty originals. #HugeDisappointment"}
{"text":"Happy to see more vegan options in Yorkville, but I guess Planta wasn't my style! VERY loud and mediocre service. We were served by about 4-5 people which made it difficult to communicate, and gave the impression that they don't focus on service at all. None of the staff we engaged with were friendly, but then again they also weren't rude.  The food was good, but nothing really blew my mind. I had the Frenchie pizza: it was somewhat flavourful and the base completely saturated the crust making it very soggy. The rose gold cutlery is cute but the knife is ineffective (don't hate me for not eating pizza with my hands, that's just how soggy it was). One thing I will give them, they do mock cheese beautifully. Great texture and flavour, and I could tell it was freshly made.  I will most likely return for more social outings but I doubt it will become a go-to!"}
{"text":"Great vegan place in Toronto! Stylish interior, super friendly staff and great food. I had the cauliflower tots and kale Caesar and coconut water."}
{"text":"Good food, excellent friendly service. Menu appeared creative but I can only speak for the burger which was excellent. Honestly, it was the second best veggie burger I've ever had (which is still impressive considering the number I've tried). Will be back to try more..."}
{"text":"What a treat it is to go to a restaurant and not be limited!! Went here to celebrate a birthday.  It is nice and spacious and has some serious mood lighting going on. Our group ordered separate apps and share a few main. I highly recommend the coconut ceviche! So fresh and it's got a bit of crunch thanks to the corn nuts. We also had the comfort food cauliflower tots - tasty! The third app was the Caesar salad - this one did not wow me - super salty for my low salt palate... For the main course? The Italian job - yum! And e lettuce wrap - love those fried oyster mushrooms! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Yet another restaurant brought to us by the always successful CHG hospitality group... Cashing in on the vegan movement with trendy aesthetic and modern atmosphere, Planta appeals to the rich, upper-class Torontonian who likes to flaunt the fact that \"they're at a vegan restaurant, they care about their health, and they just got back from a yoga class!!!\" This is a restaurant designed specifically for profit and no passion.   The staff was super friendly and nice, which is why this place gets 2 stars, BUT they literally had no idea what was going on with the menu. Me and my party ordered the nut cheese plate to start, it was EXTREMELY minimal for $20.25, and when I asked about what the different types of cheeses and crackers were the staff had no idea and had to shuffle through a bunch of notes to tell me. Took about 5 minutes to figure out what I was actually eating. The actual cheese plate flavour was good nothing to complain about, the truffle cheese was on point. My biggest problem was that they had just put it on the menu a week ago and a couple months prior I basically had THE EXACT same cheese plate at Live Organic Food Bar, but got way more cheese and more flavour. Literally, all the 3 kinds of cheese were the same as the ones at Live Organic Foor Bar. When we tried to get more crackers (cause the plate came with literally 6 crackers) 2 seperate waiters brought us some that were totally different and not as good. So much confusion.   Onto the drinks, my friend got some watermelon alcoholic drink that literally tasted like nothing. None of us could taste the alcohol in it and the watermelon flavour was so subtle. Basically it tasted like watermelon flavoured water...BUT it was really pretty!!! I had a shot of ginger, lemon and orange juice and I could only taste the orange juice.   For our meals we shared the eggplant lasagna, habibi salad, lettuce wraps and tacos. Everything was pretty mediocre, eggplant lasagna was good but very mushy, lettuce wraps were okay but soooo much bbq sauce the flavour was extremely overpowering, habibi salad was decent I guess - the greens were nice but the falafels were super dry, and lastly the tacos were just straight up bad. Everything was really way to small for the price too.  Altogether the food had no integrity, also nothing was organic.   Side note - if you want a nice instagram photo, this place is perfect."}
{"text":"Calling all vegans and vegetarians! This is THE place to bring your veg-skeptic friends!   Nothing against the typical vegetarian restaurant that serves super foods and sprouted grains in a cardboard box lol but let's admit that just because you're vegan or veg it doesn't mean you want to eat extra healthy seasonless food every time you go out (let alone your meat eater friends!). It also doesn't mean that when you feel like splurging you want a big greasy veg burger with fries like you'd get at Doomies.  So to me, that's what's awesome about Planta. It's not too too healthy, not too junky and loaded with flavour! Its diverse menu is sure to please different taste preferences, including from non-veg folks. They offer from burgers, cauliflower tots and beautiful salads to pizzas and more exotic dishes.   I particularly recommend The Frenchie pizza (one of the best I've ever had in my life) and the chicken-fried oyster mushrooms (what is that delicious sauce they top them with. Yum!).  Another plus is that Planta is gorgeously decorated and has a cozy atmosphere, which makes for a great date or chill girls night.  It is a bit pricey though, so if you're feeling attached to your \"dough\" it might not be the best choice. But if you can afford it, it certainly is worth it!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for the atmosphere and service.  It is a casual restaurant, with servers wearing baseball shirts. Our server was friendly, but the timing of dishes seemed odd. We were ok with food coming out as it was ready, but we ended up a long time with a bowl of truffle fries without our pizza. By the time our pizza arrived, we were no longer hungry and got a little turned off by all that was going on with it. Pizza Bianca shouldn't have olives AND capers on it, not to mention fried cauliflower and vegan cheese (no cheese required!). It was a disappointment.   We had coconut ceviche to start, it was delicious. Little stingy with the tortilla chips, which meant having to overload them. But the tender coconut filled in beautifully for fish. We then had lettuce wraps, very tasty, though the chicken fried oyster mushrooms were a bit too salty. The truffle fries were ok. For dessert we had coconut pudding, which was amazing due to the scoop of passion fruit sorbet that complemented the cool creaminess of the young coconut.     Aa for the price: two of us shared one starter, one pizza, one main, one side and one dessert. One bottle of sparkling water and two coffees. The bill came to $95, which is too steep for lunch.   I would come again just for dessert."}
{"text":"I had my birthday party here last night and I cannot even believe how wonderful my experience was! Firstly, the ambience for my table was perfect. The service provided by Devin was absolutely spectacular. He was very intuitive with all my requests, we were always on the same page! He even brought over a free watermelon poke bowl since he was mistaken about it's availability. He was an absolute wonder, I really hope he's there every time I come back!  The food was absolutely spectacular, only one of my guests is vegan too while the rest are not, and everyone was so impressed at the quality of the food! It was all just perfect. And the cake on top of that! I ordered the chocolate fudge cake, which turned out to be one of the best cakes I'd ever had in my life. I adore this restaurant, it's become my favourite in the city. Highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Decor was amazing. Service was good. The food was unfortunately very underwhelming. The coconut ceviche had 3-4 small pieces of shaved coconut, 3 very thin slices of avocado, a few tbsps of coconut milk and 4-5 chips. The dish lacked depth like salt or citrus. Was not impressed with the $14 price tag for such a small dish. I had the burger as my main and my husband had the bianco pizza. I felt like both of these were just alright. Both could have used more salt or something extra to take it to the next level. We had to ask for more chili oil for the pizza. I might return with friends that want to try it but my husband for sure will never go back."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Excellent ambience. But I was hungry within 2 hours. So order more than just one dish. Even if you are full!!"}
{"text":"Planta held their first wedding reception ever last week for my friend and it was amazing beyond words. Everything was perfect from the food, the extensive cocktail menu, the staff, and the interior! They were able to offer about a 10 course meal - all vegan and you wouldn't even notice from the taste that you're missing anything! Loved their cocktail menu because they were all unique drinks that you can tell they carefully picked to offer (not just the usual open bar). Small intimate tables available as well as longer group tables, very great choice of reception for smaller weddings  Favourite dishes were coconut ceviche, lettuce wraps, eggplant lasagna and the mushroom pizza. My friends loved the coconut pudding and sorbet dessert. Only downside was the curry did not come with any rice or roti of sorts so most of it went to waste as it got collected back by the staff. Portion sizes were a bit too huge that a lot of food was wasted - would have loved to take them to go"}
{"text":"So thrilled that Toronto has an upscale plant-based restaurant!  Everything about Planta is perfect - the food, the service and the beautiful environment. Food standouts are the cauliflower tots, pizza and fried rice. Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Welcome!   I am not a vegetarian, but come from a family with a vegetarian sister and two pescatarian parents. Luckily, they're all pretty flexible, but they would LOVE this place. Finally, a veg-focused restaurant that goes beyond Bowls.   Now, I've gone for dinner and brunch. For dinner, the ambiance was wonderful. Low lights- you could have a great date here or a fetching business dinner.  Brunch is as you'd expect, light and bright. I found service to be a little stronger at dinner than brunch, where the attention was pretty erratic.   Standouts! At dinner, I loved the mac and cheese. It didn't taste vegan, so it's really impressive to have a comfort food dish like this where you have no idea cheese in missing. I also appreciated the coconut ceviche. The flavours were exactly the same as a fish ceviche, ripe with lime, but there's no mistaking the coconut freshness. And while you're at it, try out some of the cold press juice-filled cocktails.   At brunch, I really just devoured the cauliflower tots. A squirt of lemon made these little bites sing, and they also were mysteriously cheesy. Brunch as meal can be very vegan-friendly, so there were less surprises here. I also really liked the potato hash, which brings patatas bravas from Spain to mind.   Give fancy veganness a try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best service. Cute little male host started off a perfect evening. The waitress was phenomenal. The food was great. Avoid the Asian dumplings as they are average and the soy dipping sauce overpowers your taste buds. The \"crab\" cakes were amazing and tasted better when I ate the leftovers the next day. The cauliflower tots were so great. I wanted to stick them in every orifice. I may have actually done so as I had a few too many of their amazing drinks. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"A beautiful, airy restaurant with a casual vibe. I found each of the food items was imaginative and inspired.   As a group of 4 we ordered the watermelon poke, fried kimchi dumplings, Thai noodle salad, chicken fried mushrooms, and Frenchie pizza. Definite favorites were the Thai noodle salad and chicken fried mushrooms.   The Thai noodle salad was complex. I enjoyed the freshness of the papaya, carrots, mango with the crunchy puffed rice and cashews. The chicken fried mushrooms paired well with the chili sauce.   The watermelon poke was interesting to try and was pretty remarkable for it's tuna-like consistency and taste.   Probably would not order the Frenchie pizza again. While nothing was particularly bad per se, it didn't wow anyone at the table and was pretty forgettable."}
{"text":"tl;dr: Food is really just so-so, especially for the price. But service and decor are impeccable. Come here if you're looking for a nice, aesthetically appealing experience where you are sure to be treated well - but not if you're looking for a yummy meal.  [ food: 2/5 ] Maybe I'm expressing an unpopular opinion as everyone seems to LOVE this place but I was quite disappointed by the food, especially after reading all the reviews. Mostly I was just disappointed by the restaurant's theme of trying to recreate the taste and texture of non-vegan dishes using plant-based ingredients, as opposed to simply letting vegetables shine by cooking and flavouring them well.  I've been vegetarian for most of my life and I've done 2-3 month spurts of being vegan, so I empathize with how hard it is to create genuinely delicious vegan food, especially when trying to emulate things like cheese or meat. Perhaps that is where Planta gets a little off course: I've never been to a vegan restaurant where the imitation was as good as the real thing. On the other hand I've been to fantastic vegan restaurants (i.e. Hangawi in NY or V Street in PA) that shine by simply creating dishes which are first and foremost delicious, and happen to be vegan as an afterthought.  To be fair, portions are decently sized and nobody will leave hungry.  Turmeric latte was genuinely delicious. Chai latte was a little overspiced and tasted somewhat sour.  Queso dip was fine but nothing special. The dill was an interesting flavour accent that worked surprisingly well.  Crab cake texture was impressively crab-like and they held together well, so I'll give them credit for that very difficult achievement. However the flavour left much to be desired - basically just a deep fried and breaded veggie patty. Spiced bed of lentils was meh.  Burger: Honestly, this was kind of just a normal veggie burger. :/ Fries were a tad overfried (as in hard all the way through).  Eggplant lasagna: Bonus points for making this look as delicious as a real eggplant parm, but unfortunately the flavour just can't compare, and it's not exactly delicious in and of itself. Some kind of spice - turmeric, maybe? - seemed very out of place in there and dominated all the flavour.  [ service: 5/5 ] The waitresses here really shine though! Ours was super friendly and attentive without being overbearing and explained the dishes well. That's one thing the restaurant is definitely doing right.  [ decor: 5/5 ] Perfect aesthetic for the lululemon-wearing, eat-pray-love yoga-doing crowd. JUST KIDDING LOL it's actually very pretty and well-appointed, just in a way that happens to look like it's designed to appeal to a very specific demographic. It's very nice. You won't feel embarrassed bringing anyone here.  [ conclusion ] I'll bring vegan friends here if I need to impress them while we engage in millennial small talk and none of us actually really care too much about what we're eating (lulz). Meanwhile, for when I'm actually hungry and craving a decent veggie meal, I'll head to a neighbourhood Thai restaurant for like, 1/5 of the price. :)"}
{"text":"Overall experience: 9/10 Food: 9/10 Atmosphere: 10/10 Service: 8/10  Love love loved this place. If you are the kind of person who thinks of vegan food as bland and uninspired, Planta is sure to kick that right out of you!   The food here is inspiring and damn good. Dishes meant to be hot actually come out piping hot. The thai noodle salad is wonderful and I was instantly obsessed with the chocolate terrarium dessert.  Service is fine/good. They are friendly and efficient.   And from the photos, you can tell that this place is also a feast for the eyes!  The only reason it isn't a 5/5 is the value. I don't mind paying these prices but you could most likely venture out into the city and find a better bang for your buck.  THE BOTTOM LINE: fantastic food, atmosphere and good service. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I am looking forward to going again already. The decor is stunning. The restaurant is open but they have seating in clusters of elevations, and segregated areas, somehow how can have an intimate conversation with your dinner companion when the restaurant is at full capacity. Which it always is, so reservations in advance are a must.   Everything on the menu is great. Special surprise treats are the pistachio mylk and the coconut dessert. The fries are a contender for top 10 in the city and how can a vegan pizza be this good? You will not leave hungryyou will leave poorer but it is worth it.    Update  Ok I have been 5 times now. There was a large hiccup once on a Friday night where alcoholic beverages were a 10-15minute wait because the bar was backed up. We had 3 rounds so ughh.  The ambience, food, and relatable staff is very worth coming here. The cauliflower tots are incredible, Thai sweet potato soup had us toasty in -20 weather. The cocktails are fantastic. The entire experience and eggplant lasagna had my guests from Milan raving one afternoon."}
{"text":"Loving this place right around the corner from my condo! New hot spot for vegan lovers and neo veges alike. Decor is very fresh and chique, stirs up memories of uptown manhattan. Cauliflower tots are my go-to, followed closely by the watermelon poke, and dangerously juicy burger."}
{"text":"Amazing food. This restaurant won't disappoint. I was pleasantly surprised that vegan food could taste so good. We had the cauliflower app and the spring rolls. Both were really good. An I also the Thai salad which was light and refreshing. Dessert was the best part, we had the brownie with salted caramel ice cream and you would never know there wasn't dairy in this dish. It was rich and tasted incredible. Service was fantastic and it had a great vibe with a DJ and good music. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Nice decor, food was ok, i feel it was too oily for me. There was too much oil on my pizza and you can taste the excessive oil in their fried mushroom, but it is good to give it a try if you like fried veggies and want something to post on your Instagram :)"}
{"text":"Planta does not disappoint.   I have dined at Planta four or five times and the food has been consistently delicious. These are the dishes that I loved and will happily order again:   The Chicken Fried Mushrooms Shiitake mushrooms in a light crispy coating that go oh-so-perfectly with an addictive asian chili-lime sauce.    The Queso Dip A black bean dip that is so creamy, so cheesy, so fresh and flavourful. The dill is a nice surprise! I do miss the root veggie chips but I enjoyed the freshly-fried and seasoned thick tortilla chips.   The Cauliflower and Tofu Lettuce Wraps Tofu and cauliflower cooked to perfection in a slightly spicy, sweet and tangy asian sauce. You assemble the handheld bite yourself and you must use all the ingredients to get the full experience (tofu, cauliflower, kimchi, pickled cucumber, peanuts, toasted nori, cilantro, mint). A lovely medley of sweet, salty, tangy, and crunchy!  The Italian Job Pizza Perfect pizza crust. The fennel \"sausage\" was so savory.   The Chocolate Terrarium A dairy-free chocolate mousse with peanut butter cream, fresh raspberries, honeycomb toffee pieces, crumbled chocolate cake, salted caramel, sprigs of dill and gold dusted peanuts... In one word, heavenly!  The Chocolate Brownie Dark chocolate-y brownie that wasn't too sweet topped with delicious sweet chocolate coconut whipped cream. A lovely way to end a lovely meal!  The Chai Latte Creamy, frothy and fragrant with cinnamon, ginger and cardamon. It was perfectly sweetened by dates. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Planta is a gorgeously designed restaurant in Yorkville that attracts primarily young girls and the typical crowd of Yorkville. I ordered the burger which was good but not incredible and the queso dip which was fantastic. What was weird is they didn't offer buns for their burgers or carrot dogs that were gluten free. Side note - the carrot dogs are legit just a carrot stick on a bun with some toppings and they charge $17+.   I also had watermelon sangria which was delicious but again, a bit overpriced ($13+) and the desserts looked fabulous but I was too full to order one.   All in all, this is a great place for vegans and vegetarians to try out and the atmosphere is fantastic. However, it is a bit overrated when it comes to food."}
{"text":"I've been eating a plant based diet for  about 8 months and this was a treat! I kinda forgot I was eating vegetables at one point. Decor was nice - pretty much a real life Pinterest board. A bit pricey, considering that vegetables are usually cheaper than meat dishes. The menu was priced similar to an omnivore's menu but I understand  that prepping these things can take time.   I had a pizza - the Frenchie. It was big for dinner and I got to take some of it home. Mushrooms gave it great depth and the cashew mozzarella gave creaminess.  I came on a Tuesday evening and my friends and I were to able to get bar seats. Might wanna consider getting a reservation.   Lastly, they had a great r&b playlist when I was there. This is the main reason why I gave 5 stars. I'll definitely come back when I wanna treat myself."}
{"text":"The burger is so filling and delicious. The portions are small but the burger is worth the money. Greats atmosphere and a good place to grab a seat for lunch in Yorkville"}
{"text":"I was brought to this place by my Vegan friend to try out a place down town. I am not a vegan but this place opened my eyes to the vast amount of flavours and textures that can be created through only vegetables!  The atmosphere was nice, it was a bright setting with a very open area to eat. You would not expect this after walking through the curtains at the entrance to keep the heat in!  We ordered the: The seasonal pizza: It had fennel, onions tomatoes, and a nice green sauce that was a great change up from the traditional tomato based sauces. I would definitely order this again!  The Italian Job: A traditional tomato based pizza with a twist! The combination of ingredients produced a barley flavour, which was a great surprise.  The Planta Burger: A basic black bean burger, the texture was nice but the burger fell apart. The best part were the fries, that tasted like the BBQ chips flavour.  Overall it was good experience,  but a bit on the pricier side for the type of food you get. I would have liked to try the bowls for a comparison but this was a great change to the typical salad bowls in vegan and vegetarian places!"}
{"text":"This would be five stars but I find the decor and ambience offputting.The food is filling and not always healthy (unlike what you think omnivores, you definitely won't leave hungry). My partner and i went on a double date here with his friends. My partner was a bit disappointed there wasn't a substitution for cashew cheese as he was allergic to cashews but still wanted cheese on a pizza, so opted for the risotto. I had the faux crab cake (which I was glad to see as I'm allergic to real crab). Our starters were deep friend cauliflower, which is hard to screw up. My crab cakes cake with some curry sauce. The other couple ordered the carrot hot dog and a pizza. The guy who had the hot dog remarked that it tasted smoked. I was vegetarian for 8 years and my partners friend is vegetarian. We all felt our entrees filled us to the brim so much we couldn't have dessert. The crowd on a Friday is loud and I feel the tables could be better spaced out. Somehow, the designer furniture and decors just oozes of trying-too-hard."}
{"text":"Oh sweet goodness. Where to start? Drinkers we're delicious. The appetizers where mouthwatering. The entrees, a total feast for the tastebuds... and we stuffed ourselves so much, we'll go back another time for deserts as they looked so yummy. And only one out of our party of four was/is vegetarian/vegan. This is a wonderful, hip, delicious place which happens to serve vegan food. You won't event notice it. We'll be back and I hope you'll treat yourself to it too!  Just don't mind the somewhat rude hostess. The wait staff is awesome."}
{"text":"Incredible vegan food and the most beautiful decor. Their burgers and fries are amazing, along with their Thai noodle bowl! Their menu is definitely on the pricier side, but if you are looking for quality vegan food then you will for sure find it here. The staff is very friendly, and did I mention their decor is beautiful? #housegoals.  The one thing that I was disappointed in that caused me to rate 4/5 is that they do not offer gluten-free buns. For someone who is GF, it was quite a let down. However, they did provide lettuce for an alternative! But they did not wrap the burger in it."}
{"text":"Oh my god . I can't say enough good things . It's a beautiful , vibrant place with upscale decor . Top notch service with a DJ. Great crowd x coconut cheviche , watermelon poke and Bianca pizza . Just to die for . I will go back there again soon , you won't be disappointed if you give this place a try ."}
{"text":"My husband (who is vegan) and I came here for lunch while visiting Toronto and loved it. All of their dishes are very fresh sounding and I love that they seem to avoid most of the fake meat options. (Although I do love a good seitan.) We had the cauliflower tots to start which were delicious, and we each ordered a pizza. The pizzas are fairly big, we could have ordered a second appetizer and one pizza and been fine. I had the pizza bianca and it was probably one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten! It is definitely on the pricier side, but you pay for quality, and this place is quality. We arrived around noon for lunch and the place was packed, we were lucky to get a seat at the bar. Apparently they take reservations so I would recommend making one!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to try Planta for a couple of reasons: It has David Lee (Nota Bene), looks really nice, and concept of all vegetarian/vegan is pretty neat.  I'm glad I made reservations for a Friday lunch because it was busy!!!! Granted it was New Year's Eve lunch and everyone was probably off work, but highly recommend reservations.  Planta has a pretty neat cocktail/wine list with some being organic.   Food is delish. One thing I really like is how the combination of flavours work well. I had the Thai Salad and it was essentially eating a fresh, deconstructed Spring Roll. YUMMY! My husband had the soup du jour (lentil) yum and for his main, he had the Planta Burger which he said was delish...and filling! You don't miss the meat here at all.  For dessert, we tried the Avocado cheesecake with Lime and while zingy and yummy, nothing to come back here again for.  Overall, I would highly recommend this place for lunch. I'm not sure if I would come back here for dinner, except for drinks and this place really is snazzy.   Service is efficient, but despite it being busy, our glasses were always filled with water. Yes and Yes!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, vegan heaven, great ambiance and good service.  Never thought vegetarian/vegan food would taste so good!  Their burgers are probably better than a hamburger, I know that's a bold statement but it definitely won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Very impressive! Planta takes plant-based dining to a new level. Toronto has been waiting for this. Much bigger inside than it appears from the street. Trendy decor, live DJ, very friendly and attentive staff.  Started with the SHIITAKE MUSHROOM app: delicate & delicious!! Could have eaten 2 orders myself. Really impressed with the kimchi which tasted like real Korean kimchi!! Also shared the QUESO DIP, served with super crunchy seasoned tortillas. The dip was garnished with fresh dill, a surprisingly tasty departure from traditional cilantro.   My friend had the CARROT DOG: a generous portion served with gloriously chunky crispy golden seasoned fries. Would go back just for the fries alone!  I had the HABIBI SALAD: satisfyingly crisp split pea fritters and lentils served over a big bowl of lettuce and micro greens. A beautiful salad with an equally beautiful name (habibi = 'my love' in Arabic).  Was so full, couldn't even think about dessert, but will definitely be back to sample some of their other dishes and delicious sounding cocktails."}
{"text":"So, admittedly, I've only been once.  And you'd have to pay me to go back.  I had some kind of lettuce tacos that were decent (nothing good enough to finish but wasn't horrible either) but criminally overpriced.  I think they had it as a main when it wasn't big enough to be a starter but it was edible.  But we didn't finish it as small as it was.  It just didn't speak to us as food.  It was a neat curiosity item, but not something you wanted to eat much of.  But it wasn't horrible.  The price was horrible for it.  We also had the Planta Burger and I have to say it was WORK, hard work, to try to scarf that one down and in the end we failed.  Neither of us would finish our half burger.  My date was a woman who will eat anything.  She's a \"utilitarian\" eater.  She thinks Freshii is amazing and when I eat what she's eating I'm at a loss as to why it's amazing.  I only say this to say that yes, I'm a picky eater (in terms of flavour profile - I like my flavours substantial and balanced) but she is an anything goes type of eater.  She could eat almost anything and say it's \"great\" - like the opposite of a foodie.    She can eat anything EXCEPT half of a Planta Burger!  She even loves vegan food in particular.  But she could not eat the Planta Burger.  Sure it LOOKS like a burger but it tastes as comparable as maybe a sweet beet salad would be to a burger.  No attempt to make a tasty, savoury burger from veg ingredients.  More like something that LOOKS like a burger but tastes like a sweet beet salad with no bite to it.  I cannot call it less than horrible to be honest.  It was inedible to both of us.  The texture still troubles me to this day when I think of it.  Like mush.   Mushy mush.  And the server told us it was considered the best vegan burger in Toronto!  I thought either the judges were on crack or else Planta paid for that win or else vegan burgers in Toronto must be utter crap, because this one was really, really bad.    We also had some other dish that we were able to finish but I don't remember what it was.  It obv wasn't that good either (or I'd remember it) but it was better than everything else on the table and we did finish it.  Maybe it was fries of some kind??  Anyway, my colleague tells me that this place is amazing and I just had a bad experience.  Maybe she's right.  My date and I def had a horrible experience.  In fact, the waitress was surprised we didn't finish two of our three small dishes, and we told her it was really bad.  She apologized and offered nothing for satisfaction, even as overpriced as the food was.  I got the impression that enough ppl send food back there that it's not even seen as an insult anymore and they just take it as part of the normal course of business.  They might think it's because ppl don't like vegan food.  I should say I was vegetarian for 10 years and I like veg-based food a lot if it's well seasoned or spiced (I don't mean \"hot\" when I say spiced - I mean various spices that form a flavour profile of any distinct kind) well.  This was not my jam.  It was one of the worst meals I've had from an establishment that had good yelp reviews.  It might be THE worst in that category.  So I feel it's my civic duty to balance the reviews here.  Staff was friendly, food was mostly stuff we weren't going to be inspired to be able to finish eating and the establishment didn't seem to take our inability to finish our tiny meals as anything they should try to rectify or make up for at all.  Hope this helps somebody.  Part of me wants to cry \"The Emperor Has No Clothes\" or \"This is Uncle Tetsu the 2nd\" but I'll just leave it as \"I REAAAALLY don't get it.\""}
{"text":"Who knew vegan food could taste so delicious?! Of course, in the upscale Yorkville, you can't avoid expensive, but it was definitely worth it.   The interior is gorgeous. Very bright and tropical feely in my opinion. And the rose gold! Rose gold chairs, rose gold cutlery, and even rose gold door handles!  I was here for a work lunch and we decided to get a variety of apps to share. The truffle fries were tasty, the kimchi spring rolls were nice and crisp, we had brussel sprouts and I typically do not like brussel sprouts but they were delicious, but my absolute favourite would have to be the cauliflower tots. These yummy things were a bite of heaven!  I ordered \"crab cakes\" as a main. It didn't have a crabby taste, but it was still really good. My coworkers let me sample their food as well. The eggplant lasagna is a good choice as it had a deep smokey flavour you wouldn't expect. My overall recommendation if you want to guarantee the best meal is the truffle mac and cheese. Every bite felt like I died, went to heaven, fell back to earth and do it all over again. It was so so darn good!   To end things off, we had dessert and oh my their portions were large. I had the chocolate brownie and it was so rich and creamy -- I really don't know how they do it. My coworkers got the chocolate terrarium which had really cute presentation, replicating a terrarium. My other coworker was feeling adventurous and decided to go with the lime cheesecake. All great choices though I would probably go with the chocolate brownie as a winner.  Thanks Planta for showing people that vegan can be fancy!"}
{"text":"It probably helps that I am from out of town so this place is a real treat. I sort of wish Yelp had more stars for a place like this. I'm a vegetarian and finding a place like this is just a gift from the gods. Not always your typical vegetarian fare, relying on tofu and noodles (which are great, yes) but these guys go for more creativity, more homestyle. We had all kinds: cauliflower bites, kimchi dumplings, \"crab\" cakes (palm hearts), the Italian pizza, and finished with the chocolate terrarium for dessert (order this, BTW). Also a great selection of cocktails. Decor is fantastic, the staff are clearly really into it and they had an on site DJ spinning tunes. Screw 5 stars. Ten stars!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Planta for a long time after hearing from friends and seeing online.  We aren't vegetarian or vegan.  I'd tried the famous cauliflower taters at the Interior Design Show and they were great.  Dining in we tried the watermelon poke and coconut ceviche to start.  Both were pretty good to start with.  I got crab cakes they were nice but had a lot of dill or some herb on top.  My husband got the hot pot but he didn't really enjoy it.  The bok choy pieces were humongous.  My friend got the Frenchie Pizza But she didn't like the sauce we weren't sure what it is.  We got our daughter the Italian Job and it came out really late compared to the other food.  The pizza was tasty.  We also got cold pressed juices which were good.  It was quite pricey for what it is but hey it's the location and vibe.  The burger next to us looked good.  Maybe I'll go back to try but my husband said he doesn't want to go back lol."}
{"text":"I've been to many vegan restaurants in the city, and this one is very mediocre. The decor and atmosphere are very beautiful but the food was okay."}
{"text":"Planta has a really good atmosphere and makes you want to eat vegan food. I tried the crab cakes and the truffle macaroni. Both were good dishes. I'm going to try to get my boyfriend to come here so he can understand how delicious vegan food can be. The planta burger was ordered by quite a lot of people around me in the restaurant, so I'll probably order that next time."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with interesting food, came here for dinner on a Thursday night. I plan on going back again. The service level is high but slower and they give you time to enjoy the meals. If you're in a hurry for dinner I don't think this is the place. The food was very well thought out and combinations were interesting. The bean queso had a ton of dill on it, as apparently other items on the menu do too (which I love, but some could be less enthused about). Their cocktail list also looks very well thought out and my experience with the Aloe Mule is great. A friend wanted a modification on the Aloe Mule and the server and bartender took it in stride and turned around a great cocktail that fit his dietary needs.  Paprika fries or whatever the normal fries are aren't to my liking but truffle fries are on point. As a lazy-vegetarian I thought the burger was trying to taste like meat to the point where it ended up in the uncanny valley (so close that it made me feel weird about it). The vegans I was with were very impressed with the burger. I would have liked to see a menu entree of vegetables that look just like vegetables. I bet there are many vegans that make their own vegetable dishes at home and want something different, but as a lazy-vegetarian/ friend of vegetarians I was hoping for a menu item with tons of cooked delicious vegetables - roasted vegetable stew?  gazpatcho? (I have the same sentiment for HogTown Vegan). Overall, I'm a fan and Iook forward to trying more items."}
{"text":"Just checked out this trendy, chic Vegetarian restaurant. The vibe, atmosphere and decor was refreshing. The food was delicious and satisfying. I ordered the tofu scramble and the potato hash. Warning: potato hash is NOT a small dish. I was originally going to order the green monster smoothie and potato hash, but my server fibbed and said the potato hash was a very small portion. The potato hash ended up being larger then my main dish...   Overall, the vibes are good and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Boring, nice room but better food at Doomies for 1/3rd of the price.  Coconut ceviche was in a shallow soup bowl with 4 thin slices of coconut and the same of avocado - for $16.  The Thai salad was Green Mango quality.  Go to Bent if you want a 'real' version.  And the burger was par w/Doomies.  Let down!"}
{"text":"Delish!  So nice to have an upscale meatless restaurant in the area.  Definitely pricy...especially the drinks...but the outstanding service and atmosphere made up for it."}
{"text":"So good to see such a nice Vegan Plant Based Restaurant in Toronto. A wonderful mix of Vegan Comfort Food and other Vegan dishes that would be considered more on the fine dining side.  We can't wait to go back and try different dishes.  Highly recommend this place for both the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food, service and reasonably priced. This is David Lee's new entry to the Toronto dining scene and has he ever hit the mark especially with Vegan diners. Creative menu and well executed."}
{"text":"Very good food and very pleasant place but no so good in terms of customer service, waiting and hosts; mainly when you have a baby together:/ very sad about this because the placw is good, but my experience was not good: a hour of waiting, I had to live."}
{"text":"I'm torn, 3 or 4 stars. The atmosphere is fun and trendy (I really respect that they're trying to make a vegan restaurant a popular hangout) and the service is friendly and attentive. What I ended up ordering was also pretty tasty, the kale ceasar and the frenchie pizza. They both tasted creamy and cheesy and delicious, despite their fresher vegan origins. It was nice to enjoy a rich tasting meal without feeling weighed down afterward. I guess my only issues come in with two things. First, their menu is confusing, it lists things like bacon and parmesan etc. I had to ask the server what they actually were made of. I know it can be lengthy on a menu but I think a lot of people would appreciate full explanations of what they're eating. Especially with a place like this where \"cheeses\" and \"meats\" are composed of other items. Second, their menu has A LOT of coriander on it. And apparently it cannot be taken off. I know for a fact I'm not the only person who doesn't like the plant, even the server mentioned they get the request to take it off a lot. So please Planta, figure this out. I would try many more of your items if the coriander could be removed. All in all, lovely place and I'm sure I'll go again but Fresh and Urban Herbivore still take the vegan cake for me."}
{"text":"After trying to plan to go to Planta since they opened, I've now been twice in the past week. I'm vegetarian, and generally don't prefer to eat vegan (I love cheese!), but the first time I went with a friend who is vegan, and the second time with a carnivore. Both times everyone was very happy with their food. Firstly, as someone who is used to only having a few options to eat, it can feel overwhelming (in a good way) to be able to eat everything on the menu. However, I think the some dishes definitely were better than others. Between the two visits I tried: cauliflower tots, truffle fries, lettuce wraps, crab cakes, coconut ceviche, Bianca pizza and Habibi salad. The standouts for me were the ceviche, crab cakes and Bianca.   Everyone raves about the califlower tots and they were certainly tasty, but I feel like I expected them to be; truffle fries were also great, but really, I have rarely met a fry I don't like, so again didn't blow me away. Lettuce wraps and Habibi - both of my friends ordered these and I shared a bit - I don't think either of them hugely enjoyed them, although they were far from bad. In both cases I think I lucked out with my orders of crab cakes and Bianca pizza as I loved them. With the pizza my friend said she preferred it better than her main (Habibi). I've never eaten crab, so I have no idea how the cakes compare to the \"real\" thing, but the flavours were awesome. The Bianca pizza was super creamy (allowing me to forget it was vegan!) and given the portion size and price ($17) definitely best bang for your buck. I really enjoyed the coconut ceviche as well for the flavour, but my friend was less of a fan and I think for almost $14 the portion size is pretty small. Overall, I'd definitely go back and I'm glad I've tried so many things on the menu because I know which ones I'd veer towards again."}
{"text":"Accidentally walked by and decided to check it out. Best fanciest vegan restaurant in Toronto! I ordered the avocado toast, chicken fried mushroom, potato hash, plants burger, and tofu scramble. Every dish was full of unique flavours but delicious nonetheless. My favourite by far was the chicken fried mushroom! The only thing I was not a fan of was the service, I had to literally hunt down our waitress every time I needed a top up or the bill. It is unfortunate especially since the food is so amazing!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. It's a beautiful place with a creative menu! The atmosphere is pretty casual but you're in Yorkville so you know what you're getting yourself into. Came here for my birthday as a surprise. Some on the staff definitely turned their noses up at us but they said hello and goodbye etc.  The potions are fair but it just depends on what you order: - Planta burger with fries. I had much higher expectations. Disappointing. - Bianca pizza had good portions and was everything I expected it to be. - Crab cakes were delicious, make of heart of palm. If it was my only main I would still be hungry - Tumeric lemonade, what can I say, it packed a punch! They didn't hold back. - avocado key lime pie lacked something to hold it together  I'd come back but only for a special occasion when I'm ready to shell out dough"}
{"text":"Planta is fantastic. Expensive, but that's what it aims to be. I've gone a few times for special occasions.   The hanging chairs near the front kept me entertained for a few minutes while I waited for a table the first time I was there. Most visits, however, didn't involve any wait. We were taken promptly to our table (arrived 5 minutes before reservations).   The decor is comfortable, modern, and balanced. I wish it were real plants along the wall, but I accept that's probably impractical.   The atmosphere is positive and energetic without being too loud to enjoy conversation.  Planta is a reliably great experience with interesting and tasty vegetarian fare. I'm skeptical of vegan cheese in general, but I don't hesitate at Planta - it's all great!"}
{"text":"Full Disclaimer I am not a vegan by any means and was almost a carnivore for a part of my life. I have started to appreciate vegetarian items now though so enjoy a good vegetable dish. With high recommendations coming from a vegan friend who tried their food at a vegan festival not to mention a fellow yelper who I feel has a similar palate to moi I had high expectations.  First the interior a nice welcoming space with good color scheme and reasonable dinnerware/flatware. However the washrooms are located upstairs and don't have locks!! quite unnerving.  We were here for a brunch so decided to order large plates and ordered an app of cauliflower tots to share. The drink list is extensive with some interesting cocktails and a few health focused drinks.  My dinning companions (DC's) and I ordered a bottle of Cava (decent) and one person stuck to Beau's beer. The app was decent (most of deep fried stuff ought to be :)  Now for the main I ordered a crab cake and DC's ordered the burger. The mains took their time to arrive meanwhile we enjoyed the pleasant setup.  They have the look down pat of a crab cake IMO. The first bite reminded of Japanese dish Okonomiyaki (I luv that dish) and the salad it was served on was good (nice tangy and then sweet notes) Hmm I didn't enjoy this dish as it had a lingering aftertaste. There was something heavy about this dish (the crust or the absorbed oil) that was of putting to the extent that I couldn't finish it. My DC's were OK with their burger. I tried the fries and wasn't impressed with the overwhelming paprika.  I guess this place is trying to bring mainstream folks by offering faux versions of popular dishes. However in these two examples the results weren't good. I might revisit as am starting to explore this area and would try a vegan dish which is vegan in the first place. So far 2 stars for food with a half star bump for service/ambiance."}
{"text":"I don't think I'll be back. Way overpriced AND they like to play games with their guests: order the \"Roulette Pizza\" and see who at your table eats a mouthful of jalapenos...so much fun to watch customers in agony!! Eat modest sized and overpriced plates of brussel sprouts while being asked repeatedly if you want to order a drink and then once you've ordered said drink, be asked again and again throughout the evening \"would you like another drink?\". To cap it all off, have your overpriced and modest sized plates taken away from you before you've had a chance to finish eating! Not once but several times! I can't for the life of me figure out what the fuss is all about with this place. Also crowded, noisy and poorly lit."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was definitely not your typical vegan restaurant in Toronto, so I liked how creative they got with the decor. The food was also on that same level, but the planta burger to me missed a bit of flavouring and tasted a little bland in my opinion, albeit maybe they could've added a savoury sauce to really hit the spot for my guest and I, but alas, it just missed the mark for us. The fries were a definite hit, and the spaghettoni was also pretty tasty - I'm pretty sure it's because of the sauce that accompanied the dish - something we also agreed upon.  The kombucha punch was pretty tangy, and I'm pretty sure the beet juice had something to do with that. Overall, I enjoyed the taste, but would probably opt for a different drink next time. I didn't end up ordering any dessert, but hoping on a sequel visit to experience that. Would come back and try out some of the other menu options. A must-try if in the area and can get a seat!"}
{"text":"In the spirit of trying something new, my friend and I headed to Planta. We are open-minded meat eaters excited to see what plant-based food is like. Is it veggies trying to be meat? We shall see!   The location is absolutely gorgeous. All angles scream 'Instagram this!' I'm glad we made reservations, this place is busy! My friend had heard how good the Planta Burger and their Truffle Fries were, so that was a no brainer. Myself, having a deep seeded love for pizza and carbs, chose the Italian Job.    We split the burger and pizza...obviously. The burger was HUGE and amazing. It was a black bean burger with all of the toppings a burger should have: mushroom bacon, queso, tomatillo ketchup and pickles. Wow. As a meat eater, I was impressed. It was juicy, tasty and so very filling. The seasoning was on point. The hype about Truffle Fries was true! A little messy, but so worth it. You'll be glad you got them. The pizza was not as good. A little soggy from toppings, but the toppings didn't save it. Not as much flavour as I'd hoped; I'd try a different pizza next time.   Did we get dessert? Damn right we did. I had the Banana Split and she had the Brownie with Ice Cream. Even though we were stuffed, we couldn't NOT get dessert. The Banana Split was exploding with fruit flavours. The vanilla ice cream was coconut, the strawberry was actual strawberry puree and, if I didn't know this wasn't real ice cream, the chocolate would've fooled me. If you think the Brownie is huge by the picture, it IS. My friend could barely get through half of it. It was rich and heavy; I recommend sharing this one!   Service was fantastic. They're used to getting experimental meatatarians in there, so they know how to handle us.  I'm willing to bet the majority of the patrons are not vegans! Good times all around. Great ambience and beautifully plated food."}
{"text":"My friend waxed poetics about Planta for months.   My sister wanted to have a sister date with me but wanted to keep it light because her honeymoon is coming up, so we came here for dinner one night.  We tried:  Charcoal Sour Peach Don't Kill My Vibe  Frenchie Pizza Habibi Salad  Sinful Chocolate Brownie   We made reservations and when we walked in at 8:30pm, Planta was still popping. So popping in fact, it took nearly 20 minutes to flag down a waiter to take our order.  Thankfully, within that 20 minutes, we had put enough thought into our order.  The Food: The Habibi Salad was amazing. Crunchy, light, and the tahini added the perfect touch without being overpowering. Too back it came with 5 falafels. If it only came with an even number of falafels.   Frenchie Flatbread: one of the best pizzas I've tried. I was in love with the cashew mozzarella, which tasted more like a creamy sauce. I didn't miss the cheese at all.  The Drinks: Charcoal Sour: I loved the foam they achieve on top even though it wasn't made with egg white. Quite admirable on their behalf.   Peach don't kill my vibe: I live for rose flavoured drinks and this one was light and fizzy. I loved how the rim was decorated with roses. So cute and tasty!  Sinful Chocolate Brownie: One of the best brownie desserts I've ever had. It was so rich and chocolatey. The portion was huge and definitely meant for sharing. The only downfall was the coconut oil in the chocolate syrup so I scraped it off due to personal preference. Other than that, the coconut whip worked well to add a balance and lightness to the brownie, which was somehow the perfect balance of cakey and fudgey.  Note: The waitress we had, after we flagged her down was super sweet and helped up decide on some items. The food also came really quickly relative to how busy it was."}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant! Absolutely love the decor, and even the dishes and utensils they use. Met up with my two girlfriends to check out this plant based spot. Keep in mind this review is from someone who is neither a vegetarian or vegan. We started with some cocktails, and I got one called ticket to rye-d and the kombucha mojito. The mojito was a bit too sweet for me, but the rye cocktail was perfect! Not too overpowering, and the flavors all complimented each other well. My girlfriend ordered a drink with aloe vera, that was their take on the Moscow mule, and with the ginger inside, I would have easily enjoyed that as well. For our apps, we got the cauliflower tots, truffle fries, and fried mushrooms. The tots basically melted in your mouth, and I could have had 20 of these. The fries were good too, and the fried mushrooms were just ok, but nothing to write home about. For our mains, we got the Frenchie, risotto, and Singapore noodles. I'd say all three were pretty mediocre, and needed a bit of a kick. Our server was absolutely lovely, and very attentive in this busy place. For a damp Wednesday evening, this place was packed and many waiting to be seated. I will say this place is rather expensive, and for the lack of flavour from my mains, don't think it's worth it. If I did venture back, it would be for the cocktails and tots!"}
{"text":"Waaaaaa. I wanted to like it. I wanted to sooo badly. But I super, super didn't.  I will admit I'm not a vegan. I can eat cheese (this seems like the hardest sacrifice in my opinion). But I generally eat vegetarian or pescatarian, and am aware of the plight of a vegan trying to go out to eat. I think Planta is taking advantage of that plight. I think they will have a customer base of vegans with limited options and folks who live or work in the neighbourhood with limited options. But, Planta, I don't have limited options. And I would not chose you again.  The negatives : food is way overpriced. Way. And I'm not someone who needs a plate filled with food to appreciate it's price; I value quality over quantity. But these prices were insane. My aunt, sister and I go out to eat once a month all over Toronto at some real winners, and this was the most expensive meal we've eaten together. This may have been acceptable if not for the service. If you're trying to sell yourself as \"fine dining vegan\" with \"fine dining prices\", I want damn fine dining service.   The service was awful. Misinformed, poorly timed, half assed. Food was way too slow, drinks were way too slow. Bill was...you get the idea. They poured my water and it had a rubber band floating in it, so I let them know, and they brought out cauliflower tots to make amends which in and of itself is fine, but at a restaurant geared towards dietary restrictions, maybe ask before you just randomly bring us a dish? Comp something we end up ordering? It seemed like an amateur way of apologizing (NB I was not upset about the rubber band).  They need to do bathroom checks. Locks didn't work, no toilet paper, dirty and gross. Doesn't fit the brand.  And finally, the food. It was fine. Flock has better salads. Stuff was pretty one note, no complexity of seasoning or flavours. It was shocking how little spice or herbs were used in the dishes. Bland. Boring.  Skip."}
{"text":"Loved every aspect of this place.   It scores 10 out of 10 on the following: ambiance, service, food quality, food taste, food variety, cocktails, prices, cleanliness and the list goes on. What a gem!!   This was the perfect venue for a girls night. We had cocktails to start off and then shared a bunch of dishes. I want to go back to try more but even the food aside, the ambiance is so warm and inviting and the service was top notch - friendly, accommodating, welcoming and just went above and beyond to make our night great.   Check this place out - vegans and non-vegans alike. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the prices suddenly went up, and now they're a little out of my price range for frequent dining. It's really too bad because I loved coming here. Absolutely amazing vegan restaurant. I love their brunch and Sunday mornings is usually when I will be there. The smoothie bowl is to die for.   A little secret, their smoothie bowl recipe is on their blog. I make it a few times a week. But yeah, still come in for the real deal, ambiance, and amazing juices."}
{"text":"I find it hilarious people say this place is overpriced then in their next line explain they are a student. Guess what broke students: Planta is not for you, nor is it trying to cater to you. Planta is a high end vegan restaurant. Do not spend your OSAP money here.  Does this model work? Of course it does, hence why it's impossible to get a table without a reservation on a Fri or Sat.  I thought the food, service and atmosphere were five stars. I could have done without hearing Arcade Fire during my meal but I can forgive because the Cauliflower tots were NEXT LEVEL. I didn't save room for dessert but I will return this week and take on a chocolate terrarium.   Planta reminded me of Crossroads in Los Angeles; high end vegan small plates. Another restaurant I absolutely love. I am so happy we finally have a similar place in Toronto."}
{"text":"A fancy vegan place with lots of vegetables at a steep price... Am I being played? Or are the vegans being played.  Very surprised to find planta at the Vegan Food Festival because I would never walk into a vegan restaurant and pay top dollars for vegetable tapas. Never.  I had my doubts and gave them the benefit of the doubt just because I was at the fest, I though, \"Hey! Why not whatever hahah,\" my smile has never faded so quickly.   I had the bean tacos and omg did it just taste like cold beans with dry, floury, cold, crumbly, sad, miserable excuse of a tortilla or soft taco, or whatever the *@$# I put into my mouth. What in the turd did I just spend 10 or 12 dollars on.  That's what I asked myself. I have had vegan food with an abundance of flavour and freshness from local neighbours who grow their own food. Heck I have a mini organic farm in my own backyard and I could serve myself better food.  Why do people eat here? This is a joke! Not veganism, no, not the lifestyle some people sacrifice their B Vitamins for nor their wallets, THIS PLACE. W H Y.  Someone let me know and take down my review if this planta isnt the same goddamn one at the vegan food festival because I rest my case here and NOW.   DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR GO TO KENSINGTON MARKET."}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday here back in April. Made reservations in advance. Planta is in the heart of Yorkville, very nice area.  Most vegan restaurants are gluten free and raw also, i.e. Rawlicious, Live. But not this one, which is what makes it so great, although you can request the pizza on GF dough.  I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious the pizza was. It's been a while, but I ordered some mushroom one and was different and very delish. I believe everyone that came enjoyed the food and we had a great time. So far, this has been the best vegan/veg restaurant that I have been to, but with the variety, it didn't even feel like I was missing the animal protein."}
{"text":"I have to say i absolutely love this place. The food is fresh and SO flavourful. There were 4 of us and the waitress recommended we try a bit of everything and gave her recommendations. Thai noodles were our favorite, the burger being our least favorite. Tried the eggplant lasagne, truffle fries, the carrot dog, and the bianca pizza. We loved it all. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Amazingly creative vegan hot spot!! The space is very hip and each and every dish we ordered was really delicious!! I highly recommend trying it whether you're a vegan or a carnivore!! It will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food that doesn't make u feel like it's vegetarian . The place itself is beautiful from the inside . Lovely ambiance!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. Fast courteous service. The entire staff is very polite and reservations are recommended as it seems to be very full when I've been there."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Sweet Jesus: super instagram-worthy and trendy, unaffordable as an everyday meal, and, after you've gotten over yourself and all the hype, just mediocre.  My best friend and I came at 5:15 for an early dinner (the only reservations they had until 8:45 on a Thursday) and the restaurant was packed within the next half hour. Business was boomin' at Planta! Surely we made a good decision to splurge on dinner here right? Maybe not so. Throughout the course of our meal, we quickly began to question why so many people were eating here, and how every one could afford it. For dinner, we shared:  1. cauliflower tots ($9.75):  -I'm not a huge fan of cauliflower dishes as they usually turn out bitter and mushy. This was no different, and the dusting of the \"truffle parmesan\" made it super salty.  2. coconut ceviche ($13.75): -they served this to us on a white plate, and at first it literally looked like nothing. This dish basically tasted like lime on top some slippery stuff with taco seasoning (reminiscent of the one they use on the tortilla chips at la carnita). I can't believe they charged so much for 3 slices of coconut meat.  3. the Frenchie pizza ($17): -tasted / looked like someone smeared cream of mushroom soup onto pizza dough -It turned out to be SUPER salty. I love pizza and was sad I couldn't get myself to finish a second slice.  4. truffle fries ($6.35): -did not taste the truffle. Maybe they forgot to drizzle the oil onto ours? The \"parmesan\" was SO salty, but props on the generous and even sprinkling of parmesan onto each fry.  Perhaps it was the combination of dishes we ordered, but I felt Planta left me craving for some real food afterwards (with real cheese!!) I was super sad dinner wasn't as enjoyable as I would've hoped. I had high hopes for planta. For now, I'll be opting out and hitting up fresh, or my new favourite, kupfert and kim for some wholesome vegan/ vegetarian food."}
{"text":"Modern, hip, and somewhat upscale vegan restaurant with a creative menu. I came here for date night with my meat-lover boyfriend on a Friday night. We arrived without a reservation, and were seated within 15 mins.   We explored the menu before ordering, and I was so intrigued by the creative dishes! My boyfriend played it safe and had the Planta burger. His critiques were that the burger bun and fries were good, but he prefers the burgers at Fresh. I had a bite and I thought it had a good taste (I have yet to try the burgers at Fresh though). I ordered the eggplant lasagna and it was delicious! It was tender, creamy, and had complex flavours. We finished our dinner with the chocolate terrarium dessert. The dish was beautifully presented and looked like a terrarium (so creative)!  It tasted great, but I thought it had an overpowering peanut taste.   Overall, I enjoyed our dining experience at Planta. I would come back to explore the menu more!"}
{"text":"I finally decided to check out Planta due to all the hype surrounding it. My experience was average.   The restaurant itself is beautiful. It's very \"instagram-friendly\" if you will. The service is also good. The waiters/waitresses are attentive. However, the food is a different story.    My friend and I decided to order the cauliflower tots, truffle fries, Thai salad, and the avocado lime cheesecake. We were so excited to try the tots and fries but to our dismay, it was average. They weren't terrible but they weren't AMAZING. They were honestly pretty bland, and we've definitely had better. The Thai salad was pretty good but the noodles were also very bland. I think the only dish we were satisfied with was the cheesecake."}
{"text":"If you don't mind paying a bit extra for \"ok\" food to cover the Bay&Bloor rent for this hi-decor restaurant, this isn't a bad choice for a date. But if you do, then save half your money and go to a low rent veg resto or just DIY for the same, if not easily better vegetarian food.  Atmosphere was nice, fancy, comfy and dimly lit. Loud with the din of conversations but with somehow proper acoustics to be able to speak in a normal voice to the person across from you. Service was informative, courteous and lovely.   Food tho? Everything was just ok. In Toronto, it's just too easy to get better and if this place wants to endure, it needs to lock it down tighter on flavours and differentiation. Vegetarian is getting a lot of interest these days and this place isn't holding it down properly. Planta burger was $20, and while the effort to fashion black beans into a patty was appreciated, it did not impress much flavour wise: small & dense, mostly dominated by a bready mediocre bun, with indistinctly flavoured fries and a drippy yogurt dipping sauce. Lentil curry side for about $8 was big and filling, poverty dorm-style, but unremarkable. Thai noodles was a tossed slaw of cabbage and vermicelli, which are such basic ingredients that the dressing HAS TO be the star, but unfortunately it was a vinaigrette that could have benefited from some time or heat or something that didn't make it too obvious that this was a $17 dish made up of $2 ingredients.   Beers came in tall boys, but priced at $8.50 Ouch.   Overall I'm not mad. Just not sure it was worth the hype."}
{"text":"The decor is absolutely beautiful. Such a nice place to grab a green juice (or cocktail) after work. The vybe is chic and the service is wonderful.  The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is that for such a wonderful place with very pricey meals, the food is just good, not spectacular. The menu is creative and I did enjoy my juice and salad however I had very high expectations of this place and I can definitely say I've had much better vegan food at other places.  That being said, I may have a bias as a lifelong-vegetarian and someone who has tried a lot of healthy eats. For someone who may not venture off into the vegan world that often, this may be a great spot to start off. And it's definitely a hot spot in the city that you should at least try out. Who knows, I might give it a second shot."}
{"text":"Like the rest of the city, I am enthused about Planta. It is Fresh 2.0 (x100000)  This is a refreshing, beautiful and satisfying food experience. Keep up the good work, Planta peeps! Can't stop recommending it to my friends and family.  Highlight: QUESO DIP! Tangy, zesty, tassstttttyyyyyyyyyy.   Pro-tip: the queso dip makes another appearance on the menu (shows up on their much discussed veggie burger)"}
{"text":"Really cool looking place inside and the menu selection is super unique. Can't believe it's totally vegan with how great the food tastes too (and the portions are great)!   Only thing, the service is super slow because they're usually very busy in there."}
{"text":"Love to see a fancy vegan place in TO, but I was underwhelmed. The ambiance felt too busy and chaotic for a romantic night out, but perhaps that's because I went within the first month it opened. Staff gave great advice on food choices - the cauliflower tots were tot-ally amazing. The pizza (had The Italian Job) was pathetic - all dough, toppings incredibly sparse, slightly burnt."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an asthetic looking restaurant with full vegan options, this is definitely the place for you. When I mean asthetic, think of minimalistic White Walls, with simple and yet bold decorations, it's definitely a place to take your girls for an insta worthy pic. They have chairs that are hung from the ceiling! So cool.   Their menu is really diverse, from burgers to vegan hot dogs to curries. It is more on the pricey side, I couldn't spot anything less then 15$. But there are alot of options, definitely something for everyone.   I got the planta burger and it was really good. I have no idea what the burger was made of but it was more on the soft side, usually I have a preference to crispier burgers, but this was delicious nevertheless. The meal also came with fries and oh man were they yummy. They were sprinkled with a spice which made each bite of the crispy fries potatoes even more yum. It came with a side of ranch for dipping. Altogether it was about $20, which I found was overpriced for the amount of food, (the burger is small as my palm).   The service was great, everyone was nice and attentive to get me what I wanted. I needed to charge my phone and the waitress was nice enough to put it in a place she can keep an eye on!"}
{"text":"This is one of the more beautifully appointed restaurants I've ever been to. The decor, the plates, the glasses, even the silverware... it's all perfect.   I came here for brunch with some vegan friends. We ordered for the table and got: Caesar salad: WOW, this was fantastic. It tasted like parmesan, and I don't know how they did that. Cauliflower bites: Crunchy on the outside, soft and pillowy on the inside. Savoury and beautiful. Smoked salmon pizza: I wasn't a fan of this, I found it too salty and too briny with the very liberal sprinkle of caper berries. Pancakes and the cinnamon bun were decent, but I have no sweet tooth so I'm not the best judge. My friends all lost their collective minds over it though.  The restaurant does a great job recreating vegan versions of favourite dishes in ways I haven't experienced before. Just watch your pocketbook. This spot ain't cheap!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this hot spot after hearing all the rave reviews about this. Didn't really have much expectation because I'm not vegan and a plant-based restaurant just didn't sound too appealing to me. I'm a carnivore. Their food exceeded my expectations, decor and atmosphere was impeccable. I would recommend this place to both my vegan and non-vegan friends!   Service 4/5 Decor 6/5 Food 5/5 Price 4/5  Service (4/5) - So the experience. Came here with a girlfriend on a Friday night around 5pm. I was greeted by two hostesses who asked me if I made a reservation. I didn't make one. No problem. They found me a table anyways but I was told that they would need the table back in 1.5h. I appreciate having that warning. Place packed up fairly quickly and most tables were full by 6-6:30pm so if you plan to come around that time for dinner make a reservation. The waitress served us drinks fairly quickly but we had to flag someone else down to order our meal. She did come to check and ask how everything was in between so that was appreciated but I had trouble finding my waitress to get my bill, probably because the place was getting more packed. For these reasons, there is some room for improvement on the service side.   Decor (6/5) - It is obvious that this place has spent some well thought out time and design in their decor and use of space. As an interior decorator, I really appreciate all the fine details they put in to set the ambiance and lighting of the space. They have very comfortable velvety couches and quality wooden chairs. Far from what you would find at IKEA. I really loved their choice of cutlery, rose gold utensils, marred ceramic plates and cute water droplet designed cups that look like something you would find at pottery barn. They have a garage door style window opening up to Bay Street, great lighting and lots of sky lights too. Perfect space for small parties and celebrations. I would love to find out where they purchased everything but let's get back to the food.   Food (5/5) - I was very impressed with the dishes here. My girlfriend and I started with a drink (cold pressed cocktail with beet juice and coconut shavings and a watermelon sangria). I would recommend skipping on the sangria and going for a cold-pressed drink instead. We ordered cauliflower tots with truffle Parmesan. Comes with five meatball-sized pieces. Was quite a small app but they were cooked to perfection - crispy/crunchy on outside and warm and soft on the inside. I wish there was more!! For mains, we shared two dishes. The Frenchie pizza (mushrooms, squash, cashew mozzarella, arugula, truffle oil, parmesan). Their pizza dough is made with 0 flour. This was one of the best vegetarian pizzas I have ever had. Loved the mushroom and squash wow! It was very filling. Size is somewhere between a typical small and medium sized pizza - 6 slices. We finished 4 slices only. Ok the second main we ordered to share was the Thai noodle salad (green papaya, carrots, cucumber, mango, nori, tofu, shitake mushroom, kaffir lime, ginger, basil, coriander, mint, puffed rice, cashews, chili dressing). I was worried it would be spicy but it was very light, refreshing with a tiny hint of sweetness. Loved the shiitake mushrooms in this salad. We couldn't finish this so packed most of it to go with two slices of the pizza. I was really surprised to be so full from this meal.   Price (4/5) - With two drinks ($30), an app ($10), a pizza ($17) and a salad ($15) our meal came to $75 give or take with tax (tips extra). The drinks and salad are priced on the higher end but otherwise being in the Yorkville area I think a meal for two with drinks comes out to be around this price."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant! Innovative, delicious plant based cuisine that will blow your mind. This is the future. The service was also top caliber, friendly, fast and thoughtful. The only critique - the desserts are too big! Seriously - so you might want to share. I would highly recommend this restaurant to vegans and omnivores. Fun and vibrant atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"What is it with restaurants with beautiful decor and interior, beautiful branding, and terrible food? It seems to be a trend that Planta is definitely part of. Everything is so pretty and instagrammable, yet everything on the menu is trash. Will not be back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. I had the 18 carrot hotdogs- what a surprisingly tasty dish. Made with marinated carrots, it looked like a beef hotdog. But a vegan version of the popular dish.   The staff is awesome. Attentive, friendly and so helpful. The atmosphere was just perfect. This is definitely a popular vegan spot in Toronto. And as it should be. Attention to detail is obvious.   A great experience, great friends, great food. A perfect night!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: This is not an attack on David Lee's beautifully designed restaurant and creatively-imagined food, it is a call for the chef to make improvements. I am SO happy that Toronto now has a fully plant-based fine dining institution, but there is a lot of room to make the food at Planta better.   So you'd think that a vegan with a big appetite and a strong inclination towards all-vegan restaurants (read: don't have to annoy waiters with a thousand questions) would have a positive bias towards Toronto's finest vegan eatery. However, my taste buds were sufficiently disappointed.   Not because the food was inedible or atrocious, but because it wasn't spectacular. David Lee is the chef, for christ's sake! If you've been to Nota Bene you'll know why my expectations were so high.   At Planta, the carrot hot dog tasted like I was drinking a bottle of liquid smoke, the kale ceasar was underdressed (and over-mushroomed), and the dessert was mushy and boring. I was only impressed with the truffle fries and habibi salad.   I'm sad to be writing a disheartening review about a restaurant that supports a plant-based diet, but I also realllllyyy like good food and want Planta to make improvements.  I will certainly be back, but it is not first on my list."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and for lunch. To be honest the food has been fantastic but the atmosphere and service are a tad weird.   The restaurant seems almost like they are trying too hard and being a bit too pretentious. Also during brunch, the same waiter didn't come back to our table, it was someone new each and every time which was annoying.  For brunch, I had the quinoa parfait with almond cream, berries and granola, which was delicious. Also had the best dairy free chai latte I've ever had, though it was pricey.  For lunch I had the special which was a raw zucchini pad Thai. It was very good, but I wish it had some heartier vegetables with it.   Would come back for an occasion but it's quite expensive for what you get.   Update: went back, food was good again, service is literally horrible. Took 15 minutes and me attempting to flag down the waiter for water. Could not get the waiters attention. They really need to figure out their service because it'll eventually drive them into the ground. Three times here and either mediocre or just plain bad service."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today and got good service from the bartender. I sat alone at the bar.  He recommended the Habibi salad which was actually incredibly tasty and fresh. I would have it again and again"}
{"text":"Is a meal at Planta pricier than any other vegan meal you've had? Probably. But is it an excellent option if you don't eat meat and going out somewhere \"fancy\" with people often means ordering the lone risotto at a nice resto? Absolutely!  There were some hits and misses with the food, but it was overall a great (and great-looking) place to celebrate. Portions are large. We were so stuffed by the end of our giant 2-hour lunch that we couldn't get to dessert, but they were happy to let us linger and finish our wine.  Notes: + Peas & Rice ($6.35): this side was excellent (and sadly seems to have rotated off the menu at the time of writing). Its simple name belies the savoury mix of red beans, pimento, pumpkin and coconut milk that makes it up. + Pizza ($17): tried some of a daily special with greens - if it's any indication of the other pizzas I'll happily get another one on my next visit. ± Planta Burger ($18.90): the concept of a $20 veggie burger may be a little hard to stomach, but that aside, it's pretty good. It will fall apart though, and was a bit dry - use the tomatillo ketchup. Spiced fries on the side were DELISH!!! ± Steamed Broccoli ($6.35): Good. It's broccoli. ± Curry Hot Pot ($18.25): I was expecting something heartier and thicker - it was still tasty although not super exciting, so I'd try something else next time. - Chicken Fried Mushrooms ($6.35): tasty but only when they just hit the table - they very quickly become greasy and limp, so get to them fast if you're going to order these. - Fried Kimchi Dumplings ($10.25): hard pass. Sounded great in theory but they were pretty much just over-fried dumpling wrappers without filling, which seems to be the norm judging by some other reviews below. + It's so pretty here."}
{"text":"For a meat eater, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Planta! My sis is vegan and is always trying to convince folks to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised by my  Planta burger. A friend had the Singapore noodles which were also amazingly tasty. The desserts were a work of art and delicious! I recommend the coconut passion fruit for sure! The portions aren't the biggest so the price of items may seem a bit much. The decor and excellent service is worth paying for though. As I gradually head more towards plant based eating, I think this will become my go-to restaurant."}
{"text":"I love that with Planta, the focus is on delicious food, it just happens to be plant-based.  We had the Cauliflower Tots, Fried Kimchi Dumplings, 18 Carrot Dog, and Macaroni Bolognese. Everything was delicious, but in terms of uniqueness, the Cauliflower Tots and 18 Carrot Dog were definite standouts.   The carrot in the Carrot Dog has this intense, smokey flavour that was absolutely amazing. The mustard and pickles help to cut the flavour a bit.   The cauliflower tots tasted like they had a lot of depth to them, and we had to try not to devour them too quickly.  I've heard people criticize that there's too much effort to imitate \"meaty\" flavours, and there are things that kind of throw you off initially, like \"Crab Cakes\" and \"chicken fried oyster mushrooms\". But I feel like what its really borrowing is the heartiness of dishes traditionally associated with meat, it's not like it's trying to hide vegetables in meat texture. Flavour wise, two thumbs up from my vegetarian friend!  Portion sizes are on the smaller side, but not a big surprise, given the location and origins of the restaurant.   Atmosphere is great, while the entrance looks small, it is deceptively spacious inside. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Happy to have another veg restaurant in the city! A bit expensive for what it is, but expected in this neighbourhood. The cauliflower tots are unreal and I've been happy with everything I've ordered here (pizza, dips, salads)."}
{"text":"We went on Saturday March 31st 2018.  Parking was easy and nearby.  We had reserved online earlier in the week and had received a telephone confirmation, so it was a bit of surprise when we showed up and they didn't have our names on the list!  After some initial confusion, we were seated shortly thereafter.  The inside of the restaurant was very nice with high ceilings, and some lovely green plants lining the right side of the wall.  They also had a live DJ who was spinning some tunes that we liked.  The foods we enjoyed:  The \"Coconut ceviche\" appetizer and the \"Thai noodle\" appetizer.  They were very tasty and we recommend them.  The food we were impartial about: The \"Sweet mess tacos\".  Messy and sweet yes, but maybe something tart needs to be in there.  The bland taste of black beans, sweet potato, and corn is all we really tasted.  The foods we didn't care for:  The \"Planta burger\" and the \"Crab cakes\".  The vegan patty needed a little \"Maggi\" seasoning, along with a little cumin and \"Allspice\" seasoning to enhance the taste. Otherwise, the texture and meatiness were almost on point. The crab cakes tasted too much like heart of palm, and Planta should consider call this something else.  We did liked the effort they took to have it flake off in the manner of a real crab cake however.  The cocktails were not vegan of course, and after experimenting with some, I stuck to a rum and Planta's own tasty version of cola.  We may go back and try some other dishes, because we like the ambiance.  If we do, we will update this review."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to eat at Planta for her birthday. She said \" it's vegan\". Respecting her wishes, I happily replied \"ok, sure!\"    But in my mind I am thinking \" vegan?! What IS vegan? Why am I going all the way downtown for rabbit food?!\"   ***Vegan: not using any animal products. This includes eggs and milk. ***  Walking into the restaurant, it is PACKED! I didn't know torontonians love vegan that much. You must make reservations.   I ordered their soup of the day, which was squash soup. I also ordered the cauliflower tots.   The soup is a good size. And oh so yummy!! Every bite is a symphony of spices in my mouth. It is creamy and smooth. There's an added texture with crunchy nuts or puffed rice? I think they use coconut milk in it which added some aroma. I would happily order this soup again!   The cauliflower tots were great as well. And I don't even like cauliflowers.   I had a taste of my friend's burger. It doesn't taste like burger. It's made with lentils. But they did manage to get some flavor into it by combining different spices. The truffles fries were great!   I was quiet happy with this meal. It didn't convert me into a vegan but I do applaud Planta for bringing so much flavors into vegetables. For anyone who is skeptical, I encourage you to give this a try!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service and delicious creative food. We ordered the cauliflower bites, kale caesar salad and the Bianca pizza. Everything looked beautiful and tasted even better. Drinks were strong and tasty and dessert was unlike anything I've had before. Our server asked us a ton of questions and went over the menu patiently with us to make sure we ordered something we would like.  The prices weren't as high as I expected for a vegan place in yorkville. It's not cheap, but it's worth every penny. I left stuffed but feeling good since all of the food is relatively healthy.  It's more of a special occasion kind of place for me but I'll definitely return for the next celebration."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance for this place. It was a beautiful setting: Not casual but rather trendy and chique. We didn't make reservations on a Wednesday at 6pm but the hostess made space for us (2 people) by letting us know that we could have a table (instead of the bar) if we could be done by 7:45pm (more than an hour away). We took the table and the server was incredibly friendly and polite.   Appetizer:  CAULIFLOWER TOTS: So yummy and creamy. They sprinkle some bread crumb looking bits which were so good. This was my favorite out of the three things I tried.   Dinner: EGGPLANT LASAGNA: This was a bit of a disappointment. Not enough flavor. Quite bland but a great presentation and it was filling! I asked for their homemade hot sauce which added a great kick!  CRAB CAKES: These weren't too tasteful either. They passed on the edible scale but definitely needed some sauce on the top. These are two large crab cakes served on a bed of what looked like lentils/salad.  Dessert:  CREME BRULE Special: This was quite good! Shared it with a friend (though you can eat it yourself if you're not full). I wish the creme was hot/a little warmer. It was cold and the warmth would have made the dish ideal."}
{"text":"Great place ... great food .... great service. And... wait for it .... amazzzing for vegetarians.  Loved the place. The salad , cauliflower tots, tacos and he habibi salad all of it was delicious . The burger was amazing and the patty would melt in your mouth. Just be aware that the fries are smoked barbecue fries so if don't like that let them know before hand .    But all in all a great place to go for.   Don't miss it if you are in Toronto."}
{"text":"I ate here last night, it was epic!  I was on business and looking for a new spot to eat #VEGAN at.. I stumbled upon Planta.  I got the carrot hot dog and then crab cakes as well as a yummy juice (can't recall which one, but they all looked fantastic!). The ambiance was beautiful and perfectly decorated with plants that went all the way up to the ceiling.  I was very taken back by how cool the place was and I wasn't even in LA (LOL).  Although I was seated promptly and they were busy, but I had no reservations, I thought they could have put me at a better location in the restaurant or had been quicker and more cheerful but that is just a high standard that I have!  XOXOXO"}
{"text":"Even my meat-eater boyfriend loved the food here. I've been a vegetarian my whole life and I'm used to not having a lot of options, but there was so much selection at Planta and it was all delicious.   I've been several times. My favourite appetizer is easily the cauliflower tots. They are amazing every time!   Entree-wise, I've tried the burger, the crab cakes, and the lasagna. The crab cakes were my favourite and the lasagna is a close second. Nothing wrong with the burger at all! I've had so many vegan and vegetarian burgers that it wasn't anything to write home about. The crab cakes on the other hand, were full of flavor and something I've never experienced before.   The staff here are always crazy helpful and knowledgeable.   If it weren't so pricey I'd be eating here every night. It's worth the price though, for this level and quality of vegan food. This isn't something that's easy to find.   Definitely make a reservation first as it's always packed!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here! The food is always amazing, and they change the menu frequently so you're always pleasantly surprised. The food has such fresh ingredients also! Their drinks are delicious (my favorites are the pear and peach drinks). My favorite items on the menu are the Italian Job pizza, the kimchi dumplings and their pasta dishes! I have gone with both vegans and non-vegans all of which had thoroughly enjoyed the food. The service is also exemplar, friendly and tremendously fast. Also, if you're a fan of hot sauce they have a house made hot sauce which is incredible!"}
{"text":"Ever been to a place so good that 5 stars rating is not good enough? Well this is pretty much the fanciest vegan place I have ever been to. And I have been to alot.  I ordered their Italian job pizza and their truffle fries. Pizza is thin crust. Fresh and delicious. Fries are amazing. Decor is as good as it gets. DJ playing awesome lounge beats. Friendly service.  Overall I'm very impressed by the whole experience. Keep in mind place is very packed. I strongly recommend reserving a seat. I'm surely coming back for their burger."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Planta, especially as a quasi-vegan (i.e. someone who eats minimal meat, no fish, and no dairy).  I went with a party of five last Friday night.  The \"large\" plates are tiny ... and very pricey (yes, I know it is Yorkville but the \"large\" mac and \"cheese\" was $25 and was a normal entree size for one person).  We were under the impression that the items on the menu were intended for sharing but based on my experience, perhaps, only works if you are a small group sharing.  We were seated near the front of the restaurant and it was FREEZING.  Granted, it was an objectively freezing night in Toronto but they need some way to control the cold air from blowing into the restaurant.  They must be cognizant of this issue as they brought as all blankets, which was a nice gesture.  Overall: must try for vegans/vegetarians but likely a huge rip off otherwise."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian restaurant in the heart of Bay/Bloor/Yorkville area. Just a few steps north of Gap store. This little gem is very cute and the menu is excellent. So much to choose from and the drinks are interesting as well.  We ordered the fried mushrooms which is to mimic fried chicken. And boy I must say it really did. What a party in my mouth with all these different veggie flavors. They really make eating vegetables fun and tasty. I snapped a photo of everything I ate because all the dishes were so wonderful and colorful.  I'm not even vegetarian but this place really caters to those who don't eat meat. Nothing is made of meat or animal by products. Everything is 100% vegetarian and the menu is like tapas style where you can order and share everything.   Like I said... I'm not vegetarian but after eating here and experiencing what eating a full veggie lunch looks like, I must say this place won me over. I would totally eat here again if I'm ever downtown. Parking can be tricky just to eat here though. It is just more convenient for those who walk and work in the area. Otherwise be prepared to pay $20 parking just to eat here.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food and service has been exceptional every time. Each time I've made reservations and glad I did since the place fills up quickly during peak hours. Must try the lettuce wraps, kimchi fried rice and chocolate terrarium!"}
{"text":"Planning to go a Italian restaurant nearby and we ended up here. It was just before 12 and upon arrival, the hostess weren't visibly pleased we came without a reservation. After some pondering we were told that we'd have to finish by 1pm as they had reservations.   The server was completely the opposite - she was was so pleasant and warm. We had Spagettoni and a Burger. The Spagettoni had Zucchini pesto rather than Kale.   Both were very well made and were well refined dishes. If you are looking for Vegan Junk food, this is not the place Although the dishes were great, the burger needed some more seasonings. The mushroom bacon tasted like mushroom. The texture was perfect. The burger also needed some extra toppings. Even the mustard did not have the zing. The fries with the burger was amongst the best. Lightly dusted with some spice and perfectly fried. The Mayo also had bit more lemony taste. On the plus side it seemed it was homemade and not in a factory.    The Spagettoni cooked perfectly and the sauce just right. Perhaps needed a bit of garlic and or black pepper.   The decor, the service made up all slightl deficiencies."}
{"text":"I loooooveeee Planta. Can I live here? Please?  First of all, this is another totally 'grammable place (again, didn't take pics for my 'gram, but maybe you will, I am an amateur apparently).   Second, I have never left here feeling sad about what I have eaten. This is by far my favourite vegan restaurant. I have been here 3 times and have always loved the dishes I have tried. They are constantly changing the menu, so there is always something new to try when you go, but they keep many items (like the pizzas...oh my god the pizzas) the same.   I already can't wait to come back and eat more.   XO"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. It's so good! A little more on the pricey side but the atmosphere is so relaxing and the food combinations are out of this world. Excellent for a date!"}
{"text":"Decent food, lovely all white decor and very chill casual vibe. If you're looking for a causal fun place for vegetarian, check out Planta. Oh, must get the kimchi lettuce wraps!"}
{"text":"Finally, a fine dining vegetarian experience. Impeccable all around. Ingenious and original menu, and a fabulous wine list. Service is passable. Beautiful interior design. A welcome addition to the Toronto dining scene!"}
{"text":"Love the decor of this place! Very hip interior. Came here last night with a friend and we got the Planta Burger and Frenchie Pizza, both were delicious. Would recommend making reservations in advance, we had to sit at the bar since all the tables were reserved. Will be back next time :)"}
{"text":"Planta is a vegan establishment conveniently located in the Yorkville area and has been on my bookmark list for a while now.   Having seen so many pictures of Planta's interior, I knew what to expect going in - rose gold cutlery, white tiled walls, and green accents courtesy of the plants around the restaurant. It's an instagrammer's dream for sure!   The drink menu here is quite extensive. I was tempted to order the Pistachio Rose Milk, but I settled for Aloe Views, which is Planta's take on the Moscow Mule. It was quite a strong drink with a stronger ginger flavour.   My friend and I had the Cauliflower Tots to share. From the Yelp reviews, it seems like this is a must-try dish - and I can definitely see why! The tots had a thin, crispy skin and a soft, creamy interior, similar to that of mashed potatoes. The taste was also superb, and it was hard to believe that this dish is vegan. My only complaint was that they can get a bit oily towards the end.  For my main, I ordered the Harvest salad. While the serving size was generous, I did not feel like this salad warranted the $15 price tag, especially when there was not much protein. I also felt that they added too much dressing, making the salad too acidic to ingest towards the end. Definitely ask to get your dressing on the side!  I would come back to try some of their other main dishes, but would probably steer away from the salad menu."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim because I felt like spoiling myself yesterday.  I figure I deserved it after eating so healthy and working out so much for the past few months.    I always see this place on my way to work and knew it was quite pricey, but I figured, what the heck, once in a while doesn't hurt.  In terms of the ambiance, it is amazing.  It feels fresh, clean and surrounded by lots of greenery.    I had the Planta Burger with truffle fries and the cauliflower tots. The tots were mediocre at best, so I wouldn't recommend them and it was definitely a small plate that I wouldn't even consider shareable and was pricey at almost $10 for 4 pieces. The Planta burger though was absolutely delicious.  Sometimes when you order veggie/vegan burgers, the patties are deep fried whereas I think these ones were grilled or pan fried and the toppings on it were some kind of salsa. Amazing.  Also got the truffle fries instead of the standard fries and I loved them. I don't usually eat fries and when I do, I usually eat them last.  This time, I finished 80% of fries before I finished 1/2 burger. Yep that good.   I think this would be a great place for a client meeting or to take a date, but not your everyday meal (unless you own a condo or house in Yorkville, which I don't because I'm not that rich..yet).    Verdict: Will definitely be back, either with friends or a special someone when I find them. lol."}
{"text":"What a great place!  From the outside it looks like a regular restaurant but you will be surprised  when you step inside. The place has a beautiful decor and great, friendly staff!  The food is very creative and innovative. It really tastes delicious. I am inspired by how many original vegan dishes are offered at Planta!  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"As a gluten-free (and grain free) most plant-based (fish every few months) person, Planta is a blessing. The cauliflower tots and habibi salad were both divine.  My only complaint was when I asked our server about three specific items on the menu--and stated had already messaged Planta beforehand--she tried to go over the whole menu. I politely interrupted her twice so that she wouldn't take ten minutes and embarrass me in front of my date. Then she later was annoying asking if I was fine with nuts and soy after we had already ordered. You could tell she was being passive aggressive under the guise of concern.   Regardless the food, the fresh juices and the dessert was phenomenal. The high ceilings and decor make you feel like you're in LA or Miami. Definitely returning."}
{"text":"This restaurant was one of my top choices to try for my birthday, and I have absolutely no regrets! The decor of this restaurant is so aesthetically pleasing and calm that it makes you feel at ease and comfortable with a hint of classiness.  We got a table right under the window which gave us a lot of natural light. I ordered off the monthly menu. I got a calzone that was stuffed with potatoes and a variety of vegetables, paired with a tomato sauce. IT WAS SO DELICIOUS, and the calzone itself was huge. I also got to taste the habibi salad, which I have to say that I will come back to get this again!! We also ordered a few drinks such as the kombucha mojito (MY FAVORITE DRINK) and the rose sangria, which was also delicious. Overall, I definitely will come back to this restaurant and explore the other menu items they have. It is great for vegans and for those who want to experience it. LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Walked in to try to eat lunch here over the weekend as it was around the corner from our hotel. The woman at the front desk was beyond rude and said the tables were spoken for and the kitchen closed at 245pm. It was 220 when we walked in and we counted 8 open tables plus 5 open seats at the bar (which she said were also \"spoken for\" ) there were no guests waiting for a table so I struggle to believe that in 25 minutes over 20 people would arrive to sit and place an order. Even if this was true the hostess could have spoken to us nicely and with some grace. I can't speak to the food but reading other reviews it sounds like we didn't miss too much."}
{"text":"Sitting in high top bar area. Starting out great with a very good waitress/Rachel. She is on it!  Nice too. Tofu wraps and pizza rocked. Very tasty with right spice. Wraps maybe just a tad sweet for me. But that is just me. Pizza-got regular crust with all the goodies. Green olives just give it a good \"zing\". Very nice. Just enough cream/cheese and I like a lot. Pic does not do it justice. Very good. Thanks so much. Wow!"}
{"text":"To be very honest when I made reservations for lunch here, I didn't know what to expect. I only know that it was Vegan, which was a good pick for a Department lunch as my VP was Vegan. I have to say, I really like their online booking. It was convenient and quick. I also really like that fact that they call you to re-confirm your booking closer to your reservation date.  The location of this restaurant is very convenient too. It is location right across the street from the Bay subway station. I have to say, walking into this restaurant, I was in love with their choice of decor. It was urban chic, bright, yet still welcoming and comfortable. We were a table of five so we got the oval table with the couch. We ordered some same plates to share. My favorite small plate was the Cauliflower Tots. It was so light and fluffy. For my main, I ordered the Italian Job, which is a pizza. I also order one of their cold pressed juices. I ordered the pizza because I was curious as to how fennel sausages would taste like. The pizza did not disappoint - it was delicious! There was this smoky sausage flavor to it. However, I have to say because there is no yeast in the crust, best to eat the pizza while it's hot, because I find the crust very chewy when the pizza is cold (my left overs). The cold press juice is very concentrated and OH SO GOOD! The cold press juice I ordered was the one with the ginger in it (orange in color when it came) - I would definitely recommend the cold press juices. I was really full, so I didn't order any desert. But I did order a hot drink. I ordered the ginger tea - this is also OH SO GOOD! If you like ginger and you like a strong gingery kick this is the tea for you.  Overall, the food here is awesome and the service was good. The prices are a bit on the high end, but with the food quality and the level of service, it is worth it. I am definitely coming back here for more Vegan food. One of my coworkers even said if all Vegan food tasted this good, he would not mind being eating Vegan everyday."}
{"text":"So happy I finally tried this place! The decor was fantastic and so was the service! Had the planta burger and fries and it was delicious. One of the best vegetarian burgers I've had. I also sampled the pizza and it was fantastic. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So many people told me how incredible the food was at Planta so I had to try it for myself.  My husband and I went on Saturday and we were not disappointed.  We ordered the cauliflower tots - which are so delicious. The Habibi salad is so delicious - can't wait to go back and have it again! My  husband had the Barley Risotto, which he enjoyed but he thought that it would be better as a side dish rather than a meal.  We enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and ambience and the fact that it is right across the Bay subway.  I can't wait to go back and try other foods on the menu."}
{"text":"Decided to go to Planta for brunch. I'm not a vegetarian so didn't expect to like it too much but my wife convinced me to go with her. First of all, the ambiance was great - the service was friendly and excellent overall. The decor made me think of some kind of bar from the 20s with an Art Deco kind of flavor. We sat by the window which gave us a great people watching opportunity.  I ordered the BBQ pizza and it was absolutely delicious. It was juicy and really tasty. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"tl;dr: Try Planta at least once if you have the $$$, want to be adventurous and classy, aren't starving to death, and because #yolo   Came here a few weeks ago on a Sunday night for dinner and had a good experience, but was not wow!-level impressed by the food overall. On most days, I basically eat like a vegan because I'm vegetarian and can't tolerate dairy very well, so I was suuuuper excited to try Planta -- one of the only higher-end, totally plant-based restaurants in TO that I know.  Food 4/5, Affordability 3/5: Following Yelp's advice, we ordered the watermelon poke ($13.25) and cauliflower tots ($9.75) to start. As a broke ass student for life, I do judge a restaurant by how much bang I'm getting for my buck. Here, I appreciate the creativity of the dishes because uhh it's difficult to make a pile of plants look to worth as much as a platter of meat and I do noticeably taste and commend the freshness of all the ingredients. But why is my bowl of a few chunks of watermelon with avocado + soy sauce (the dish did taste like poke btw but it was mainly the sauce flavor rather than anything else, like texture) $13.25?? Sadness and tears :'( For my main I got the Habibi salad ($17.25) and it was very filling! I have a big appetite too, but felt quite full by 3/4 of the dish.  Service 5/5: The service was very friendly and we got full explanations of the ingredients in each dish we ordered. Our water glasses were also consistently filled without reminders, so that's always a +.  Ambiance 4/5: The interior design is comfortable, kind of rustic, and organic, just like the food I suppose. The lighting is dim and atmosphere on the quieter side for dinner, but there's no pressure or need to dress up. Nonetheless, it can make a romantic date night destination :)"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is absolutely amazing... came with my family on Boxing Day and pretty much ordered everything on the menu. The flavour is literally the best thing I've ever had in my life. I love trying new vegan places and I'm pretty sure this place takes the cake as my favourite.  I attached about 20 pictures so I hope everyone enjoys them! Absolutely amazing, HIGHLY recommend.  PS: our server was named Erin and was outstanding. Very informative and enthusiastic. Sold us on apps, entrees, desserts, drinks AND lattes! ;) If the management team is reading this, give that girl a raise!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian, but I loved everything I tried. My faves were probably the Frenchie and the nachos!"}
{"text":"One of the best plant based vegan meals I've had in a long time. Creative menu. Incredible service. Our waitress was informative and could give us tons of info on food. The atmosphere was beautiful. Nicely done. Can't wait to go back. This could very well be a regular spot for me. :-)"}
{"text":"The space is pretty awesome. The location ok. It's easy to get to. The decor is fancy. What's not fancy or tasty is the food. Nothing we ordered was specially tasty or memorable. At the price point of this establishment we expected more (quite more). We visited shortly after the restaurant opened. The only notable thing food-wise that I remember is that their hotdog was a smoked carrot on a bun. It was notable because it was comical. Hopefully the restaurant can come up with better dishes worthy of their price point. Beautiful restaurant, though."}
{"text":"Best vegan food I've had in town, but the restaurant has annoyingly loud music. Not a good place to go if you want to have conversation.  I've been a few times now. Things I have had:  Awesome: - The Watermelon Poke - Cauliflower Poppers - Chicken Fried Mushrooms - Lettuce wrap - Burger - Ginger shot  Good: - Pine tea - Rose mylk  Okay: - Ceviche  - Chocolate Terrarium - Habibi - Truffle fries - Crab cakes  Meh: - Lasagne - Banana split - Tacos - Preaches and cream drink - Young Coconut pudding  Not good: - Bianca pizza - The Chocolate Brownie"}
{"text":"As I have been eating a mostly vegan/veggie/sometimes seafood diet for the last while, I had wanted to check out Planta for a long time. I was super excited when one of my girlfriends suggested it for brunch for our girls weekend in early December.  We all opted to get a shot (not alcohol but juice lol) to begin our meals. Since it was a girls weekend, we had been drinking a fair amount and I also was recovering from a nasty bout of food poisoning so we needed all of the extra nutrients we could get.  I selected the veggie burger for my main, the girls chose banana pancakes and the smoked \"salmon\" (aka carrots) respectively. The girls said they enjoyed their meals and my burger was just a-ok. I wished they had real dill pickles on the burger to add some salt and crunch.  At the end of the meal, I went upstairs to use the restroom and noticed how dirty the restaurant was. The bathroom was pretty gross and I also saw lots of food bits all over the dining room floor. Was a bit surprised of the state of the restaurant given the space itself (it is just as pretty as you see on Instagram in terms of decor).  All in all, I would return to try another dish or two but would not rush back."}
{"text":"The venue is like an instagram paradise, every little detail is like a magazine spreads but with a very approachable vibe. The menu had a wide variety of choices and it was hard to choose what to get! I got the Habibi salad with dressing on the side and it was perfect for dipping in my split pea fritters. The salad was already tossed in some kind of dressing which was seasoned perfectly. The palette cleansing coriander, parsley and mint in different bites really made the dish interesting and enjoyable. I went at 2pm on a Sunday and it was jam packed, NO WONDER, it was great. I'd love to come here and try some of the other items on the menu with my friends next time. A lot of people were eating the pizza so probably that!"}
{"text":"As a meat-lover, this vegan resto was pleasantly surprising. The coconut ceviche came with slices of young coconut (I'm in luuuh with the coco so of course I devoured that). The kimchi dumplings were crispy and not oily. The carrot dogs. DAWG. THEE CARROT DOGS. They were charred to the T. As if they set up a grill at the back and started an outdoor bbq. They tasted like hotdogs. So good. Sooo good. The fries were delicious too (more oily than the dumplings, but not salty at all). Despite the \"come here on your first date if you're trying to impress your ting\" or \"come here with your colleagues for a classy, business social\" pricing, Jocelynne, Sara and I will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"Service was much better the second time around. I was with a bigger group and we went for Sunday brunch. There were still some improvements that could be made. For example I had ordered an iced chai latte and ended up having to ask for a straw. Everyone else's drink in the restaurant had straws so they forgot to put one in mine which is fine mistakes happen. I just asked for one and it was cool. The food took a while to come out. It didn't come out as fast as my last visit. The restaurant was fairly busy that day so that could be the reason but my group and I ordered really simple brunch items from the menu (smoothie bowl, 2 nachos, banana pancakes + some drinks). Not complicated stuff lol. Everyone in my group, including myself was pleased with the food and the portion sizes were just right for brunch/breakfast. Overall, the experience was much better this time round with some minor improvements to keep in mind."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place, but I didn't. Why? Two main things.   1. The website of this place and the reality was not quite matching. It was VERY NOISY  Before we went, my boyfriend searched it up online and based on what we saw, he made an reservation. Both of us were anticipating a lot from this place because it seemed fancy and bright and beautiful on the website. But the actual dinning experience was not what we pictured. The place is very crowed and LOUD. The dinning atmosphere was just bad. I had to almost scream to my boyfriend to make him hear me clearly. It was not only us, the couple next to us complained about the noise to the waitress too.   2. Food was not the best I've had, did not live up to the price  I ordered a burger and my boyfriend had one of their pizzas. It was not crazy expensive or anything but I've had so much better vegan food that are a lot cheaper. So it defeats the point of us coming to this \"fancy\" place yet get ordinary food and bad dinning environment.   P.S. I imagined this place to be a somewhat classy place because of their web advertisment and overall style. It felt wrong when in the middle of the meal, I saw a DJ showed up with a shirt that prints \"WILD\" starting to play music. The music was not bad at all, but it was a bizzar experience to have in a vegan restaurant on the more expensive side. I thing this place had it all mixed up."}
{"text":"Awesome experience start to finish; thoughtful orchestration, well oiled machine with personality and a fantastic palate.  Bravo!  Lasagna, burger, truffle fries, escarole and habibi salad.  Wonderful drinks alcoholic and non.  Great gluten free choices!"}
{"text":"Top notch vegan restaurant that isn't \"in your face\" vegan, if you know what I mean (cough, Doombos). I sit down, have a glass of canned bucha, with a splash of uh ah that...whatever the hell they serve in there. Blueberries or something.   There's nothing quite as luxurious as not waiting an hour for your friggin meal. Every minute you wait at a restaurant, consider it a step closer to complete and utter starvation. So Planta, I thank you for never making me wait too long for those succulent dishes.  There's nothing in this city that touches the class and atmosphere of this joint. It ain't one of those empty ostentatious Dundas west, oh look at me, having a $16 martini so that people know that I'm vegan and I'm f***in' rich. Who woulda thought that going to the financial district was now low key and going to that cesspool they call \"Little Ossington\" is like walking into a big ugly bank.  Yeah, yeahhh if you know this city you know what I'm talkin about. Thanks King West for ruining not only old little Portugal but my big bad appetite too.  Planta. I will be returning to you shorty.  Btw, best bartenders in this town. I assure you. I call em Big Shinies because they're the make the best mixes in town.   Btw, Stop eating those little nuggets we call animals. You disgust me. Grow a pie  Nah but you can do what you want. Respect for all creatures."}
{"text":"Whatever your views are on Vegan, forget about them!  Many people have got a limited scope of what vegan cuisine is all about. I certainly fall in that category as one who loves haute-cuisine. While I generally restrict my diet to poultry and fish, I had been a vegetarian before so had an open mind from the get-go.  Let's start with the space and management staff: We were nicely greeted and confirmed our reservation (a must-do). They placed us near the back so we were out of the cold from the from door opening regularly. We noticed a modern DJ station and before we knew it, there was really nice \"Chill\" music being piped in throughout.   The seating and arrangements were just great. Comfortable chairs and tables, while not being crowded. Very tall ceilings made for an even more \"breathable\" space, if that is a concern for those who don't like cramped quarter.  The wait staff was incredible. Not pushy and very well informed about the dishes - something you need when maneuvering a different \"food landscape\".  Let's talk about the food: We were with friends so we decided to order a bunch of dishes and share them. I HIGHLY recommend this so you can get a real sampling of the different tastes for your palate.   Our dishes: Beets and Grapefruit So many different layers of taste and incredibly light.  Truffle Fries Don't think twice - ORDER THESE and depending on the size of your party, consider multiple orders.  The Bianca Pizza Cauliflower, potatoes, capers, caramelized onions, olives, rosemary chili oil. Very tasty although the crust edges were a tad larger than they should have been. the rest was pretty yummy and NOT soggy.  Truffle Macaroni  Cauliflower & parmesan truffle cream macaroni. Rich and creamy. The macaroni could have been more \"al dente\" but still very passable.  The Harvest Salada consisting of brown rice, caramelized squash, chickpeas, roasted pears, cranberries, napa cabbage, pecans, balsamic dressing. Very light and very super fresh. Highly recommended.  The Fried Rice A brown fried rice dish with plenty of flavor and tastes. A must order. We actually fought over the bowl to clean it off.  Desert GET the Avocado Pistachio cheesecake. It was insanely off-the-hook. With a date base and the creamy smoothness, your senses are spent assimilating the delicate nuances of flavors as your palate craves more.  Overall this place gets a HUGE \"thumbs up\". As one used to going to Fresh (not saying anything bad), we found the portions large enough to share while not skimping out. Everything arrived to our table at a steady enough pace that we could enjoy every dish in peace. The attentive staff always made sure that we had our water glasses filled as well.  Definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and nice atmosphere. Yummy vegetarian goodness. It is better to make a reservation because of the popularity. This is my second time here and it has been consistently good."}
{"text":"First time coming here and it wasn't too shabby. Got a Planta Burger and expected a bigger portion than I received however the fries that came with it was something that I haven't tried - it reminded me of a Lays BBQ chip and it was pretty good! A bit pricey, however it was expected considering the area. The setting itself was very trendy and clean. Also found it nice how we were asked if we had any allergies before we confirmed our order, not a lot of people do this!"}
{"text":"I dunno what is up with the whole trending rebranding of veggie foods \"plant based\". But I do know when you mix well heeled Yorkville luxury with vegan tastes, you get Planta.  You won't encounter any militant vegans here. Actually, in stepping into such a restaurant like this, you won't think you are in a vegan restaurant at all, absorbed in its seductive trendy tropical themed decor that's more upscale hip than earth hugging hippie. Don't worry though, you don't have to eat the whole place to feel full.  Maybe the goal of this Chase Hospitality Group venture is to make you forget that every bite served is all free of meat and dairy products, or plant based, or whatever the catchword of the day is, and thus rethink what vegan-type food can be. Their salads aren't some thrown together greens; they're well crafted and thoughtfully flavoured, and surprisingly filling. The Habibi Salad had a good spicy ting from the sumac coming off of those falafel ball things.  The Planta Burger ($18.95) is a bit nuts. I recall asking what the patty was made of, and remember hearing things like black beans, lentils, beets, and I think quinoa also. Whatever, the patty was a hefty inch thick, the overall burger small but tall. The patty itself had a earthy and mushy bean texture. But the salsa of chopped peppers topping made the burger unstable and fall apart easily. There's another kick of spicy hotness from that salsa thought. The burger comes with an healthy serving of fries, specially coated to give off a strong lingering BBQ chips aroma that just sticks to ya.  Planta is a fine dining rendition of herbivore cuisine, but it will cost you an arm and maybe a leg to try (that veggie Burger was more than most fancy gourmet beef-based burgers I can recall eating). The service was on point, as one would expect of such an upscale place. You should make a reservation, despite the size of the place it's hefty busy. Washrooms are located in the upstairs mezzanine. Watch out for the built in DJ table.  {TTC: next door to Bay subway station, Cumberland Terrace (northbound buses) entrance}"}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food, classy decor, festive meals, exciting drinks. Coconut Ceviche was amazing, as is basically everything. A great date place, family brunch/dinner, place to go with colleagues or friends. There's a big group room in the back and even a private dining area upstairs with a view over the restaurant. It's a great addition to the vegan scene in Toronto."}
{"text":"To be honest, I had higher expectations for this place. I am not vegan myself, and typically I don't eat at vegan places. However, I was in the area and a friend recommended it so I thought I'd try it out.  The restaurant has a very elegant, chic feel. The décor is amazing and the setup is very aesthetic. Loved the circle tables, comfortable chairs, and earthy feel with the plant wallpaper.   I ordered the Sweet Mess Tacos and for its price, the portion size was very small - only two tacos! However, it did taste very good. I'm not a fan of cilantro so I took it off my plate but the beans, sweet potato, and avocado blended together very well. I usually eat chicken or beef tacos, but these were so good that I forgot it was vegan!  The service was also amazing. There were plenty of servers who refilled our water constantly. And our food came in a timely manner as well.  All in all, this place is definitely on the pricey side. Since I am not vegan, I don't exactly see the value in paying almost $15 for two tacos. It was a good experience, but I don't see myself coming back."}
{"text":"Nice all-vegan dishes, amazing decor, with a steeper price tag for the quality.  If you're thinking of coming here, make a reservation to avoid the wait!   My friend and I came by on a weekday for lunch with a reservation. Walking in, I was stunned by the decor, definitely not your typical IKEA sets. The two of us were seated in one of the big comfy couches. The best way to order would be to share these dishes - there's so many and they all look so good!   Watermelon Poke $13.25 - First appetizer we shared. Plating was super instagram-worthy and the dish itself was very impressive. It was refreshing with watermelon, avocado, and soy sauce. A bit of a steeper price but good quality.  Cauliflower Tots $9.75 - Probably my fave dish. Mainly as I love all things deep-fried. They're like little deep-fried cauliflower balls of goodness, topped with some nut cream.   The Frenchie $17 - This was my least fave dish which was disappointing as the one thing I love more than deep-fried is pizza. Be ready to have mushroom soup on a pizza. It was soggy and salty.   Although I loved the service and decor, the food was only good, minus the Frenchie, not mind-blowing for the price. For this, I gave Planta 3 stars.   What the restaurant stands for though, sustainability, is one of the things that might warrant another visit. There were some dishes I definitely give a try as well and it doesn't hurt to try another pizza."}
{"text":"Finally - an upscale restaurant vegans can call home. I am SO excited about this restaurant, the creative menu and the beautiful, gorgeous, stunnninngg décor. Planta caught my attention the day it opened as I walked past and was surprised by this stunning new addition to the Yorkville side of Bay street's façade. A few coworkers and I opted to try several things, all of which were delicious, but what really stood out to me was the impeccable décor and details.   Yes, the inside is beautifully presented - yes, the retro mod look is impeccably furnished - but what really caught me was the beautiful utensils, glasses, and dishware! I mean seriously, where did they get those glasses (and where can I)?!   We ordered the cauliflower tots [better with the lemon], kimchi dumplings, coconut ceviche, spaghettoni, and chocolate terrarium.   The cauliflower tots were better with the lemon, but a little greasy and teeny tiny portion. Creamy on the inside was lovely.   Kimchi dumplings did not actually have much flavor, but one member of the party liked them quite a bit.   Coconut ceviche was amazing!!! The flavors were gorgeous, the presentation was beautiful, and the tender and moist coconut pieces were very creative and delicious.   Spaghettoni is a small bowl of udon-type noodles and zucchini noodles in a creamy nut-based sauce. Nice, and very delicious once we found the sauce, but a dish with simple and light flavors.   The chocolate terrarium is what really took the cake (ha..ha...see what I did there)! A light mousse topped with raspberries, brownie pieces, peanuts, and garnishes. It was carefully crafted and assembled, with a beautiful presentation, but I couldn't stop talking about the gold-dusted peanuts for days! What a tiny detail that really elevated the 'luxe' feel of this dish/overall experience!   Overall, I think the more meat-inclined guests to Planta might prefer heartier dishes like the burgers or carrot dog; I did find the portions very small and therefore mildly overpriced, but the experience and tastes and creativity were lovely and definitely worth repeat visits to try more of the menu.   It would be a great idea to put together a tasting menu for people new to the restaurant/vegan foods to try multiple dishes without breaking the bank!"}
{"text":"Hmm I don't get what the hype is about this place. Overall I the service was good, the atmosphere inside was pretty nice, but the food was honestly really average.  Came in a group of four and we ordered 2 apps to share - cauliflower tots and the queso dip. The cauliflower tots were pretty good, tastes like what you would expect. The queso dip was good but it was a bit on the salty side and the dill that was put in it threw off the flavour.  In terms of food, a friend got the bianca pizza and another got the eggplant lasagna, both tasted completely flavourless. Two of us got the planta burger which was definitely the best dish, but again it's nothing to write home about. Man I really wanted to like this place, but it looks like I'll be sticking to Fresh for vegan food."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick lunch while shopping in Yorkville. I was seated at the bar which had a nice feel to it, but in March, every time the door opened it was freezing!! I had to wear my jacket while eating. The people at tables didn't seem to get the same windy air.  I got the Planta burger which great but super filling. I could only eat half and a few fries before I gave up. As a vegan restaurant, it was nice to have cooked options but wish there were a few healthier cooked options as well rather than a salad I could make at home."}
{"text":"I confess. I am not vegan. I am not a vegetarian. The only time that happens is when I forget to eat meat because I had an amazing plate of nachos. This is me. However, good food to me is good food.   I'll admit I never feel full enough on a vegan meal.  However, my plan of attack was to order the Planta Burger. A popular option judging from Yelp and my friends that have gone back for it.  We were all disappointed. Half of us ordered the burger.  Everyone found it so dry and not apparently as flavourful as they recall.  Maybe because it was a busy Friday night? I don't know. For me, as a first timer. I was bummed. It was my main course. I didn't even finish it.    There were 2 items that blew me away. The turmeric latte recommended by the server. I absolutely loved it! This I do still crave.  I've never had anything like it. Delicious! Highly recommend.  Must order is the queso dip. Black beans, pickled veggies, cashew crema and tortilla chips. Love this! Could eat this all day.  If I do go back, those two items are on my list. For now, my disappoint with a main is not necessarily pulling me into this establishment right away.    If you are vegan, this place is a solid treat. Modern with an extensive menu to satisfy everyone with a multitude of dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing vibes. I went this past Friday for their first Friday sitting of dinner and I have to say my dinner party and I were quite impressed. They even had a DJ spinning tropical house! I can see this restaurant being incredibly popular with the health-conscious yuppie crowd.   Regarding the food, the most notable thing about this restaurant is that nothing actually tastes \"vegetarian.\" Forget everything you know about vegetarian food from places like Fresh and Kupfert and Kim. I went with two meat-loving guy friends and they both thoroughly enjoyed their experience here.  I also love that the cocktails were made with fresh pressed juice. Highlights of the meal: crab cakes made with hearts of palm, cauliflower tots, and lasagna. Do not order the fried kimchi dumplings! Those were incredibly disappointing.   Sadly, a star was taken off because the food took forever to come but I'll forgive them because it was only their first week of operations.   I can't wait to return for the launch of their brunch menu!"}
{"text":"Great meal at lunch will my work team. I made reservations on OpenTable and we got a great table. We had the cauliflower tots to start. Nice and crispy on the outside. Soft on the inside with cashew cheese. Comes with 5 pieces. For my meal I had the Frenchie Pizza. It has puréed mushrooms as a base sauce topped with more mushrooms, squash, arugula and cashew cheese. Tastes like a rich cream of mushroom soup on a pizza. My colleagues both had the veggie burger and said it was great! Will definitely be back. Happy to see a vegetarian spot in yorkville!"}
{"text":"The decor is outstanding. The service was great and the food was even better. Although the prices are quite high for stuff like salads and apps, the menu is creative and does include a variety of different ingredients. The pizzas are TO DIE FOR! I'll keep coming back for the pizzas."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Super tasty food and options that are delicious even if you are not Vegan."}
{"text":"I have had better food. What you get here are creations focused on sauces instead of various levels of complete fats, proteins and calories!! David McNish makes a sturdy and better tasting vegetable burger without the hefty price. If you like pure ingredients, it's here. I tried the potato leek soup, it will not disappoint you. My party was not interested in the desserts because the food was not enough to eat for a main course. Also not everyone cares about paying for a cheesecake made of avocados. That's been done plenty of times and they need to think of some more main meal choices. I'd eat here again if they could offer that want more ingredients on a 23.00 plate for dinner."}
{"text":"If you've ever doubted vegan food, you're in for a pleasant surprise.  For starters, the interior feels light and airy. It's cozy but also feels open, probably due to the vast amount of lighting. There was a lack of windows (likely due to the construction outside), but the skylights do a really good job at making up for it.   Our server said that the menu was designed for sharing, which was exactly what we did! The menu is varied, with options that would satisfy any set of tastebudWe started with the cauliflower tots, which were delicious and a must-try--perfectly seasoned and left us craving more. Next we had the 'Italian Job' pizza. The cashew mozzarella didn't quite have the same kick as real mozzarella, but was good nonetheless! My only complaint was that the roasted garlic pieces were too big and a little overwhelming. We also tried the 'Cavatelli Pasta', which was good as well, but bland compared to the other two dishes we tried prior!  As for the service, it was pleasant and quick for the most part! The servers are keen on filling up your cucumber infused water and the food came quickly! However, when it came to paying, it seemed like the server forgot about us. A little disappointing end to an otherwise amazing meal.  All in all, although the price point was a little steep, it worth it for the experience! From the light and airy atmosphere, the amazing food, and the (nearly) amazing service, I would definitely recommend trying Planta!"}
{"text":"Great vegan food! I don't usually like vegan food but this place wowed me! The atmosphere is very vibrant and it felt very refreshing! The waiters are all over the place. I found it odd that we had 3 different servers coming at our table hence why they missed one of our orders..."}
{"text":"Great place,  like the decor and vibe.  Wine list was nice,  and so were the cocktails.  A little pricey on some of the cocktails though, but it is Bay Street and it's a hot spot.  We ordered several appetizers and shared an entree with 2 bottles of wine,  bill was $275. Not bad, since there is a lot of intricacies involved with the food we ordered. If you don't cook,  you won't know how complex veggitarian cuisine is, so it was certainly appreciated.   Happy they had a DJ spinning,  and we met some of the local patrons too.  Good times had by all that night,  I would recommend trying it out.  Everything was delicious.   Side note to management: Washroom door lock is broken in the middle stall, and a second garage can is needed inside the middle of the doors,  so that I don't have to touch the handles,  I use my paper napkin.  A washroom sign would be a good idea,  along with a mirror at the bottom of the stairs,  as staff are zipping by there with hot food. Safety first"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Felt a bit over done. Service wasn't great; We had to ask for more water at one point. The salads looked good but the rest felt a bit fussy for what could have been really delicious vegetarian food."}
{"text":"Very good vegan food, great location, great design.  Pretty good service.  Very popular.  I'd say this is a \"must try\" for all vegans/vegetarians living in or visiting Toronto.  We ordered lots of dishes.  The the cauliflower tots were my favorite, followed by the side of roasted veggies.  The pizzas got mixed reviews by the table.  One pizza was way too salty.  They have a pretty large dessert selection.  Sadly, they were devoured before pictures could be taken.  One minor gotcha: although the entire food menu is vegan, the wine/beer list is not -- but they clearly indicate which ones are/aren't."}
{"text":"The food was good and different from most vegan menus but I left feeling hungry!  After spending $50 on brunch, I wanted to feel satisfied but instead I was still pretty hungry.  The atmosphere was nice, clean and refreshing.  The service was good but the value for what you actually got was poor.  I thought maybe I was just a fatty so I asked the rest of my group what they thought and the general consensus was that it was good but not worth it.  I'm happy to see veganism becoming more main stream but there are other places in the city you could go that are just as delicious and half the price."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews on Yelp, but I figured I just had to write one for Planta.  Let's just start by saying it was my first time here. My friend made reservations (which I strongly suggest, as it gets very busy), I got there right when it opened at 5 pm and was seated at our table. The atmosphere was fantastic -- everything from the decor and the music, to the service *applause*. I was a very happy cookie. :)   I ordered the cashew chai latte while I was waiting (it was delicious) and then the Habibi salad to follow. The portions were large and tasted amazing to boot. For me, that totally justified the price tag which is a little bit more $$$ than most Veg places that I've visited in Toronto.  I strongly advise you try it at least once, whether you're vegan or not because you will definitely find something you like on the menu (I promise) and the experience will be well worth it.  I will definitely be back!!! Thank you Planta."}
{"text":"This was my second time here. My fam brought me for my birthday dinner. We were running late due to heavy traffic and called in to tell them. We actually arrived almost 30min late but they seated us and said the next reservation was an hour and 15 min later.........they never kicked us out; we completed our entire meal and dessert without being rushed and I think we were 30min past the time they stated. Although it was continuously full, there were always a few empty tables so I hope we didn't delay anyone's meal. For apps we had cauliflower bites, deep fried mushrooms and truffle fries, which were all great. The queso dip and chips were bland but the server brought out hot peppers that made hubby happy. We had the Asian noodle salad that none of us enjoyed. It was cold, and quite seaweed-y. Son #1 had burger(bean and mushroom) and fries.....said it was fine but he prefers more texture in his burger. Son # 2 had the blanco pizza and I had the same on gf crust. We both loved our crusts but the pizza was bland in areas. The chili sauce on it was nice so we asked for more to put on top. Neither of us could finish the entire pizza. Hubby had the crab cakes, which he liked. We shared the chocolate terranium (mousse) that had a lovely crispy salted caramel crunchy bit in it. They comped me a chocolate brownie with vegan ice cream for my bday. It was delicious! We had the Planta punch and sunrise juice (spicy) to start and 2 cocktails. Entire meal with tip was approx $250. DJ in house was playing some great old music."}
{"text":"I came here on Victoria day to hang out with a friend. I love the vegetarian dishes they offer. Very unique in preparation and flavour. The decor was very natural and modern. Only thing I would ask is to improve their service. We waited awhile for our bills to come, which I wasn't pleased."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and we ordered:  Potato Hash: Amazing Crab Cake: Average Margherita Pizza: Average  The Potato Hash was by far the tastiest thing we had. It was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, with a perfect balance of sweet and spicy! The crab cake was OK, but it felt like there was something lacking. It did have a fresh taste to it with a citrus zing though.   Service was great, our reservation was ready on time for us. The interior is absolutely beautiful! Overall, based on the food and the prices, I won't be back.  I'll be honest, I feel like my review of this place may be of less value because I'm not a vegan, and maybe don't have enough experience with vegan food...so take it with a grain of salt I guess"}
{"text":"Great place. Delicious food and stylish decor. We came without reservation on Saturday evening but they found space  for us in the bar in a few minutes. Defenetly will be one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"A few friends and I checked this place out to see what all the hype was about. I have to say, the place is decorated really well, great vibe, and was packed on a Friday night. We made resos for 8:45PM and were there till after 11, mainly because the dessert and DJ were incredible!  But onto the not-so-incredible parts: the main food. We ordered the truffle fries, cauli tots, eggplant lasagna, truffle Mac and cheese, and a pizza.   If you're a vegan, then this place is probably a nice change from other vegan foods, but for us who weren't vegan, it was a bad version of the real deal. Cashew just isn't a good substitute for actual cheese - sorry! The food was subpar (except the dessert and pizza and spiced cider drink) but I will give them points for creativity.   TLDR: if you're not vegan, skip this place for the real deal."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan at all, but I'm open to vegan/vegetarian-friendly cuisine. (Fresh has yet to disappoint, for example.)  So it was that I found myself sitting in Planta on a very snowy February weekend. I suppose I should first say that I was extremely unhappy with the service. Our waitress appeared fairly quickly when we first sat down, but then disappeared for a full 20 minutes after that. I was going to order the nachos as a starter but I was so annoyed that I decided to skip it.  Instead, I ordered one of the specials. It was a pizza, and it's not listed anywhere on the internet (and I forgot to take a picture of the menu), so I can't tell you exactly what it was or what was on it.  Anyway, it was fine. It was topped with caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, cashew mozzarella, asparagus, and some kind of green sauce. The first few bites were actually surprisingly tasty; the caramelized onions were quite prominent, and the rest of the toppings worked pretty well. (The asparagus not so much, since it kept coming off the pizza whole.) But this is a fairly enormous pizza pie and I honestly just got sick of eating it after the first couple of slices. There was no real depth of flavor here, which meant that every bite was the same - which, of course, meant that eating this thing got to be a bit of a repetitious grind after a while.  But maybe I'm being too harsh. As a vegan pizza, it's probably above average. Maybe, though, there's a reason that pizza isn't generally a vegan option."}
{"text":"I heard good things about Planta, so I wanted to give it a try. Unfortunately, they were closing up lunch service at 3pm, which is totally fair and understandable. However, what isn't understandable was making me stand there while multiple servers and management (who saw me) ignored me. It wasn't busy. Maybe I missed a sign that said lunch service was over, so perhaps that's my bad. But it takes less than a minute to tell a customer that you're closed. I would have gladly come back another time. Now, I doubt that will ever be the case."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday at 2:30pm, the place was still packed. I highly suggest making a reservation in advance. The interior is really beautiful with the high ceilings. The cutlery is so pretty!! The food is delicious- we ordered the lettuce wraps and cauliflower tots. Highly recommend this place if you are in the Yorkville area!"}
{"text":"On the pricier side, I would recommend going in a group if you want to try a lot of different dishes. The interior is beautiful and their food tastes very clean. Not as flavourful but definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"My fave vegan spot in the city. Everything from Watermelon Poke to the The Frenchie pizza, Planta Burger and crab cakes. Had brunch for the first time here and didn't realize I received the wrong order (Overnight Oats) until the manager came over with my correct order, which was the Smoothie Bowl. Everything and anything you order here will be great. I have to yet to try everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Despite being a lover of meat, during my visit to this vegetarian restaurant I did not miss it once. The space is light and airy, the drinks (which use cold pressed juice) were great, and the food was fantastic. Reasonably priced and really different - I had never tried a carrot hot dog before and was blown away by how like the real thing it was! The watermelon poke and cauliflower tots were other winners. Interesting food and nice atmosphere, I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Came back for dinner and my experience is still much the same. The food is just ok, overpriced for what it is. Nothing particularly satiating. The ambience is fantastic however, and the service did a good job of handling the situation when there was a dish that we simply couldn't stomach."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4-5 stars for the great service and beautiful decor. It's really worth checking out just for those two factors. The food is a solid 3, but I was left mostly ambivalent about it in the end. I really enjoyed my kombucha mojito. Prices are high here, so be prepared. The \"crab cakes\" were steeeeeeep, $20+ and only just okay. The burger was also close to $20, but was a bit more reasonable at the price. You could easily spend $50 or more per person if you delved into the apps and snacks."}
{"text":"Amazing ambience, great tasting vegan food and superb service! What's not to like!  Tried their nut cheese platter with their Italian pizza (gf) pizza and it was all yummy! Very impressed with their choices, although it is a bit pricey! But again, its also Yorkville! :)   Tips: Reserve in advance as the place gets packed real quick, even on weekdays! Also, parking is hard to find around the restarting, so best bet is to find a nearby GreenP or underground lot."}
{"text":"Nice Interior. Good place for veggi lover. Have a big menu and really covers all kind of dishes."}
{"text":"The food is always great at this place but the service is a little shifty. I came in alone. The place was damn near empty. I asked for a table. They told me the only place to sit was at the bar due to reservations. So through out my meal I watched to see if the tables filled up. Sure enough (and not to my surprise) I could see 5 tables still empty by the time I left....  Planta, my money should still be worth something to you even though I'm only a table for one. Will I come again? Probably not"}
{"text":"This is an exceptionally good vegetarian restaurant. We were a party of three and shared many of the starter courses. Very unusually some of the meat replacement dishes like crab cakes, hot dogs etc... that usually turnout to be a disappointment for trying to be something they are not were great. The straight out vegetarian and vegan dishes were also delicious and varied in make-up. The restaurant is a mix between comfort food style and fine dining but then vegetarian - service is fast and friendly and they will take time to explain things for you. Selection of drinks is excellent and the wine list is amazing.  I was there on a Saturday and the place was totally packed with young largely female crowd."}
{"text":"We went here for a late lunch today... And while I was so hungry that I could've eaten a horse, alas there would be no such offerings on the menu. Fret not though, I was still a very happy diner because the food that was available was fantastic!!  We asked if an appetizer, two sides and a main dish would be enough food for two to share or not. As it turned out, it was more than plenty. To start, we had the cauliflower tots. This was really good. I always find it awkward when restaurants serve an odd number of servings, when they see there are two people at the table, don't they know people will have to fight for the last piece when they do that? Then we got the hot pot with sides of fried rice and truffle fries. The rice was great as well, though I would've preferred less saltiness. The hot pot was excellent. The ingredients tasted refreshing and the broth was light but full of flavors. And then the fries, ah yes, the fries.   Not sure why but we thought we had room for dessert... And so we each got our own. The portions are pretty big. So big that we should've shared just one of them. Especially the carrot cake. It was a huge slice.  Overall the meal was very good. I thought the coolest part was the shaved almonds that looked like Parmesan. I'm definitely looking forward to coming back and seeing what the other dishes taste like."}
{"text":"Best vegan restaurant in town! Tried the burger and Moroccan salad. Tasted like heaven."}
{"text":"Venue - love the design of this restaurant. However the one thing we all noted when there was how loud the music was when we got in (around 7:30, 8). The music was really good, lol but we were basically shouting at each other - wasn't expecting the club vibe there...at 8 on a Wednesday lol  Food - since i was basically the last person on earth to eat there lol my expectations were at the level of \"it should taste like unicorns and rainbows\".  That being said the stand out dishes for us were: - lettuce wraps - amazing. Good hit of spice, the kimchi is fresh made and done really well. The brussel sprouts could have been crispier, but the sauce on them was really delicious.   -queso dip - solid vegan queso! Loved the textures with the black beans and tang of the pickled veg. We scooped out every last morsel.   - habibi salad - good flavours, dressing was light & fritter super crispy and light.   -chocolate terrarium - such a good blend of textures and flavours!    I wasn't a huge fan of the cauliflower tots as they were a bit more bland than i was expecting (USE THE LEMON, the acid really helps). The watermelon poke was ok. It'll never be tuna, so I'm all for dishes that just highlight the vegetables for what it is (a vegetable) instead of trying to making it emulate something it's not. But the concept was interesting.   Would definitely return again :D"}
{"text":"Planta has been much talked about and for good reason. This vegan restaurant is very upscale with a classy, contemporary decor and well thought out menu. The restaurant is the newest addition to the Chase Hospitality Group and the design and quality of the interior is very much in line with the other restaurants owned by the group.  We came here for a girls lunch on a Saturday and the restaurant was quite packed. I would definitely recommend making a reservation to avoid a long wait time.   The menu is suitable for sharing and had very good variety. We ordered:  Cauliflower Tots ($9.75) - fried cauliflowers with truffle parmesan, this was my favourite  Fried Kimchi Dumplings ($10.25) - good if you are craving something a bit spicy  The Italian Job Pizza ($17) - very filling, the pizza is quite large and very good  Habibi Salad ($17.25) - decent sized portion and a good option if you're looking for a more filling salad as there's lots of couscous, peas, lentils etc.  Overall this is a good vegan option and a nice place to stop by for lunch/brunch. Didn't try their juices personally but have heard good things about those as well."}
{"text":"Wowwwwwwww.....where do I even start? I feel like I can't even get into their food, because management is literally so incompetent they can't actually maintain their facilities.  The Entrance - their front door is so heavily weighted that you either need to push the handicap button for it to open, or you need to put your back into and pretend you're getting some extra time at the gym. It is not hard to fix this management! Just call your door provider and have them lower the weights in the door to something patrons can actually open without pulling a muscle.   The Washroom - This restaurant is pretty big so I would think maintaining all three stalls in the women's washroom would be pretty important to management. Nope! Not only was one stall broken, someone had placed one of the garbage cans inside it as I guess a barricade to ensure no one took the risk of using the stall? #classy - oh, also, one of the two sinks were broken and was actually flailing around like a flamingo with a broken neck. Could you *be* more ghetto Planta?  The Heating - This was the straw that broke the camel's back. The place was actually cold! I had the pleasure of sitting across from their thermostat, lucky me. It was at 67 degrees all night, despite our server trying to increase the temperature (\"the building controls our temperature not us\"). FYI - room temperature is 73 degrees. I ate in my jacket with a scarf. Wait till summer to visit this venue folks.  Okay, now that I've gotten through the things I guess I take for granted in restaurants, the food! It was alright. It did not fill me up. Their portions are on the small size and with vegan food, it's always a bit of a struggle to feel full, unless you eat bigger portions. Our server sucked, but I'm guessing it's because she was Aussie (they don't do table service in Australia).   Someone told me to check out Fresh for vegan food. Apparently they have their &%$ together. Don't go here."}
{"text":"A very trendy vegan restaurant has opened in Yorkville about one year ago. Service is polite, friendly and knowledgeable, the food is very savoury (I had the crab cakes and the cauliflower tots, followed by sorbet and a cocktail with pumpkin) for a grand total of $60. I would come back based on my experience."}
{"text":"AMAZING food with modern, vibrant decor. An upscale restaurant with a lot of options for vegans. I have been here thrice and would definitely recommend their brunch over dinner. For brunch I loved the crab cake benedict and avocado toast. The food was very flavourful. Amongst the appetizers my favourite is the chickpea fries. They were delicious!"}
{"text":"Tried Planta last Saturday night.  A friend and I split a pizza (one of the daily specials) and the el jefe salad. Both were very good although not mind-blowingly amazing. Pizza was on the small side (flatbread-style) but salad was a very good-sized portion.   Interior of the restaurant is beautiful. There was a good dj playing (really fun remixes and mashups), service was good, and value was decent for Yorkville. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had my birthday lunch at Planta with some friends a few months ago and I was really excited about trying this place after seeing Instagram photos. Personally, Planta didn't knock it out of the park for me but overall, we were all glad that we tried it.  Positives: *Booking online through OpenTable was easy enough and if you want to book for a larger party of about 10 people, just call the restaurant and they can accommodate *Loved the restaurant's plant themed decor - pretty to look at and great for photos! *Variety of interesting plant based food choices - many of us had a hard time deciding what to get since so many dishes sounded great *Dishes that were ordered were fresh and healthy. We ordered different pizzas such as The Frenchie (squash, mushrooms, arugula, cashew mozzarella) and The Bianca (roasted potatoes, kale, capers, caramelized onions).  Room for improvement: *Flavours of the dishes were decent - not amazing (maybe an acquired taste?) *Prices were on the higher end considering everything is plant based... the expectation is that the food flavours should match that high end price though *Service was alright but servers weren't particularly friendly either  Overall, I thought that my experience at Planta was okay and I would be open to returning sometime to try some of their other dishes later on in the future but I can wait."}
{"text":"Just had my first experience at Planta & it was incredible. I'm not a vegetarian nor vegan, but the food was delicious. Don't let this deter you from coming here.  My boyfriend & I shared 3 dishes. To start we had the watermelon poke. This was refreshing, tasty & had a nice kick to it.   The second dish we had was the Harvest salad. The mixture of ingredients was great. The portion size was perfect for the two of us to share.  For dessert we had the chocolate terrarium. This was by far my favourite part of our meal. It was flavourful & decadent, without being too sweet.  To drink I had the Brickhouse cider. This was great to pair with the salad. My boyfriend had the 'Rise & Shine' juice, which he really enjoyed. We also got coconut milk lattes with our dessert. These were generous drinks, but perfect to end our meal. Throughout the night they refilled out glasses with cucumber/mint water which was a nice touch.  It's also worth mentioning the decor. It's absolutely gorgeous. I really loved the black & rose gold accents.   Overall, I will definitely be returning. From the friendly service to the amazing food, it was definitely memorable. Nice to see an upscale plant based restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"So good even my non vegan friends were convinced. Had their burgers, white sauce pizza, chicken, truffle fries, banana split and some sort of desert in a coconut with basil seeds. I honestly can't say anything bad about this place, service was amazing and decor was super pretty."}
{"text":"The decor is luxe and the service is solid (dem baseball shirts tho), but ultimately Planta offers just okay and often gimmicky food at a very steep price.   We started with the cauliflower tots, which were pretty tasty but SUCH a tiny portion to share for around $10. Watermelon poke ($13.25) was nice, but mostly just tastes like watermelon soaked in soy sauce. Not worth it. Fried kimchi dumplings ($10.25) were just that, I guess this would be more interesting to someone who doesn't eat kimchi regularly. The carrot dog ($17.25) was bullshit. We got it just to find out if it was a joke or actually good. It is literally carrots in hot dog buns, and all you taste is the pickle. Such an expensive joke. Habibi salad ($17.25) was good, probably the best dish we had but not quite worth going back for. Nice textures and flavors that worked well together. We split a chocolate terrarium to finish it off, which was good but not that interesting. Drink-wise, I had the tequila juice drink. Weak, I kind of wanted to ask if they had even remembered to add the shot.   Overall, I'm glad we went just to get past all the hype. Food was generally decent, but not even close to the quality or creativity level I'd expect for what they're charging."}
{"text":"In town for a long weekend. Great food! Coming back tomorrow. Service was excellent. Coconut ceviche!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner for the first time yesterday and loved it. The food was delicious, good sized portions, service was great. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Personally very, very happy that vegan is such a trend; places are getting so creative and the food is such a change of pace from what we're used to.  Planta has some really great stuff - like their noodle dishes, salads, thai coconut dessert, and things like kimchi spring rolls. Some regular stuff that's good, but not at all worth the price - like cauliflower tots, tacos, and veggie burger. And you do need to accept Yorkville prices - the cheese plate, for example, is creative and tasty, but super tiny and like $25. And we blew through almost $400 as a table of four.   The service was also impressively bad (but I know that depends on who you get). Slow. Didn't let us know they had specials. Didn't let us know there were menu changes. Never came back for refill drink orders etc.  But it's a great space, with really high quality food, and some really well thought out dishes. Highly recommend for vegans as a change of the usual, and for meat eaters to try, but be sure to order something you wouldn't normally eat... And give the insanely Hipster cocktails a try (bourbon sour with charcoal, or green tea kombucha tequila, for example)."}
{"text":"Whenever our out of town relatives join us we look for Vegan or Vegetarian options to meet their dietary restrictions.   Usually we have good food but it wasn't until Planta that we had an amazing dining experience and thought to ourselves - \"omg that was vegan!\"   From drinks to dessert each item was thoughtfully crafted and delicious. Highlights include: queso dip, cauliflower tots, any of their seasonal drinks, the frenchie pizza, and their to die for chocolate terrarium. Seriously if I could eat that all day every day I would!   Very beautiful vibe, great for intimate dinners or big groups and a place I would go back to time after time!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place five stars, but overall the food was lacklustre and overpriced for the portion sizes. We tired several apps, including the queso and chips and fried mushrooms, which were both great, but extremely tiny portions for the price.   I ordered the crab cakes as a main, made with hearts of palm. They looked startlingly like real crab cakes--even the texture of the fish was spot-on, but $23 for TWO? For that price, there better be caviar in there. Truth is, they are charging for the Bay-St address and fabulous decor. I mean, it's beautiful and I'm glad I tried it, but I probably wouldn't come back unless I was with a Vegan. The service was excellent, so that's something.  I wanted to keep my meal under $50 so I didn't order dessert, and I can't say I was that impressed with the dessert options here. They don't look appetizing or sound tempting, which is pretty unusual for me.  This place seems trendy and fun, and I love the concept of plant-based menus, but they don't quite pull it off here."}
{"text":"4 stars means I would recommend this place,  3 stars means I would come back but wouldn't recommend.  5 stars means best of the best!! And really give out 5 stars..  Food was great!! Place gets really business during lunch..  Read through the menu twice while waiting for my guest to arrive... didn't realize the menu was completely vegetarian until someone pointed it out..  Would recommend and revisit"}
{"text":"I have been to Planta a bunch of times now and each and every single time, it has been superb. On this visit, we were there for my partner's brother's birthday. We had made reservations for 6PM and the place was busy by this point, with practically every table taken. Since this was a family dinner, one of the things I will note was that the restaurant (since busy) was loud. Usually I'm one for ambiance but this was almost too overpowering. I could barely hear anyone speak at my table, and I would like to think that I don't have hearing problems.   Let's chat about everything else, shall we? Our server was on point, making sure we were taken care of and water glasses always full. She made sure to walk us through each and every single dish we had questions about and to tell us some of her own favourite dishes, which was super helpful for some of the family members who I was there with this time around.   We shared two plates of cauliflower tots with the table, which were so delicious. Trust me, you want to order the cauliflower tots if you end up visiting here. They are deep-fried but they are light and crispy and wonderful. I ended up ordering the Planta Burger, which is one of their most popular items. I was sold when I read queso cheese and mushroom bacon.  The burger itself is a messy delight and literally does not taste like you're eating a vegan burger at all, which is just brilliant. But be forewarned, you will get messy eating this.  I swapped out my BBQ fries for truffle fries. They charge you a premium but it was the best life choice.   Overall, Planta is a great restaurant. As a meat eater, I really enjoy it. But it's loud. Which kind of kills the vibe if you're trying to have a relaxing meal with family or friends."}
{"text":"Planta is amazing. They have amazing food, amazing décor and the atmosphere is welcoming and warm. I went last night with my sister. She got the burger, which was phenomenal (I stole a number of her fries, best I've had). I got the Bianca pizza which was also delicious, accompanied by their house made hot sauce which packed a punch.   While the food was amazing and the ambiance was appealing, the restaurant was very squishy and the tables were set up too close together. Trying to exit was a maze. I also found the food to be slightly over priced. It being a veg restaurant you'd imagine the prices to be cheaper due to the absence of meat, but the burger was the same price, if not more than your average beef patty.   Overall I've given 4 stars because I did enjoy the food and the atmosphere, I just found the place a bit stuffy and over furnished and the food over priced. I will however be back for the fries ;)"}
{"text":"was absolutely delicious. the bartender was cool and normal and gave her honest opinions on the dishes. had the deep fried mushrooms as per her suggestion, and it was great! also had the spaghettini, which is delicious. side note: the manager in the plaid shirt and the scruffy face - could you BE more handsome?"}
{"text":"WOW - this restaurant is phenomenal. Going to Planta was an experience. They truly have elevated plant based cuisine. This place rivals or supersedes any fine dining restaurant that I have been to. There was a lot of hype surrounding this place but Planta has earned it!  The décor was stunning, modern, minimalist chic with an accent on, you guessed it, plants. They had beautiful high ceilings and the lighting was perfectly ambient. They even had a live DJ and he was REALLY GOOD!  Our server was very pleasant and friendly and kept a close eye on us to make sure that we had everything we needed.  We had the cauliflower tots to start - divine! They were perfectly crispy on the outside and flavourful on the inside but I'd have to argue the best part was the almond parm and truffle cream.  For my main, I had the eggplant lasagna. It was delicious and came topped with zucchini noodles, tomato sauce and almond parm. The eggplant was cooked perfectly and the flavours were outstanding. Bae had the 18 carrot dogs and french fries that came with a light and tangy lemon aioli. The carrot dogs were smokey and cooked to have the consistency of a ballpark dog - they even looked like hot dogs.  For desert, we had the chocolate terrarium. Aptly named as it kind of looks like a bowl of dirt sprinkled with frozen raspberries, sponge toffee and, get this, GOLD DUSTED PEANUTS. I CAN'T. The devil is in the details at this place and they nailed every single one of them (with the exception of having run out of macaroni, but the 18 carrot dogs were so good that Bae didn't mind).   Places like these make me glad I've chosen to lead a plant based lifestyle. Thanks Planta!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan. Not even vegetarian. But I eat veggies sometimes.  I went there for lunch and it's good. But not great...  For apps, we shared cauliflower tots (good), kimchi dumplings (deep fried and maybe a bit too crunchy, not enough heat) and watermelon poke (not bad, I liked the avocado but the watermelon here was a poor substitute for sushi-grade tuna, and really the only dish where the vegan aspect disappointed).  For my main I had the curry bowl with purple/black rice, bok choy, pea shoots and shitake, in a lemongrass broth. I loved the sweet/fresh taste of the pea shoots  but wished they had cut them down to an edible size. It was a bit awkward trying to eat the long shoots without having bits of broth flying all over the table. The curry was almost non-existent and there was very little spice. Had they just called it something else, I probably would have loved it. It was just weird to dig in expecting a curry spice and getting a totally different (but still delicious) taste. I did really enjoy it and wished that it came with some bread for sopping up the remainder of the broth (which was more like soup, not the thick stuff you'd normally get in a curry dish at a Thai resto).  The restaurant is upscale/modern casual and in my mind a nice upgrade from the former Pangaea in that location. I remember the dining room used to be so loud, but it's way better now, they must have put in some kind of sound dampening décor (or maybe vegans just don't talk as loud as carnivores).  Looking forward to going back and trying some of the other stuff, a lot of interesting choices on the menu."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the burger here. If you're looking for a burger that tastes like meat, this is not it but I still thought it was delicious. The cheeze sauce and \"bacon\" were really great as well. We had the cauliflower tots and won tons which were also delicious. Went here with two friends who are not vegan but they both said they would come back again."}
{"text":"The restaurant is lush and tropical, with greenery of all kinds (huge murals and real life plants) being the main focus of design, but still keeping an elegant look about it all. Really enjoyed eating our meal in this beautifully designed and airy space!   The food was delicious!!!!!!!!! The only reason for the four stars was because one dish (kimchi dumplings, omg, there was maybe a teaspoon of filling for the centre, with a heavily over fried wonton shell-oyyy) was really lacklustre. All the other items however, were all home runs in the flavour and presentation department. We ordered the habibi salad, (the split pea fritters were fluffy golden balls of heaven) the Planta Burger (probably the best veggie burger I've ever had) and the chicken fried mushrooms (the cilantro garnish was the perfect final touch).   Service was also on point! Our server Jessica was attentive, pleasant, and had very good knowledge of the menu! We also had a nice plate change in between courses, and even though we only had water, had numerous top ups throughout the meal. Thank-you, Planta, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Went over to Planta with a group of friends Sunday evening. The ambience was nice, loved the music and decor. Server was very cute, don't remember her name but she had a buzz cut, very patient considering we were a larger group with lots of questions. Food took forever to arrive, we waited for the fries to arrive- it took over 40 minutes. Our entrees arrived 60 minutes after we ordered them. Didn't like the Risotto, too bland in my opinion. For a vegan restaurant I would have appreciated more lively dishes- some more colour and flavour would have been a nice touch to the Risotto. The Italian job pizza was great. Lasagna wasn't bad either- zucchini noodles were a nice touch. I would recommend the quinoa tartare. Lots of flavour. Something I would like to point out...upset that I had to ask two servers to bring us spoons with with our dessert. They put the the avocado lime cheesecake and chocolate desert in the middle of the table didn't offer any sharing plates or spoons. As dining etiquette I shouldn't have to remind the staff to bring cutlery with desserts, they didn't expect us to eat with our hands did they. Overall would come here for a drink and appetizer wouldn't recommend having a whole dinner here. One last thing I would like to add..washrooms were disgustingly dirty, the tap was broken."}
{"text":"Planta earns a solid *5* stars from me, hitting all the right notes for an evening out. The interior is beautiful (major kudos to the design team), the food measures up, and the service is what one should expect from a fine dining establishment. And make no mistake about it. Planta IS a (plant-based) restaurant with \"fine dining\" written all over it.  Our table ordered tapas style, and we were happy we did, as it gave us an opportunity to taste test several menu items. We started with the Truffle Fries (to die for), continued with the Queso Dip (also very good, though on the heavier side), then moved onto \"The Italian Job\" pizza (recommended), and finally the Keylime Cheescake, which was a light and refreshing end to the meal. We were two women, and found that we could have likely done without one of the dishes (likely the dip). Don't be be fooled by the vegetarian menu. I was unbuttoning my pants by dessert...  On a side note, we did encounter one slight glitch with our order, but found that it was rectified quickly and professionally.  Word to the wise: Make reservations, especially on the weekends. We walked into Planta at 5:00pm on a Sunday, and almost couldn't get a table. Based on this, I imagine this place fills up quickly on any given night."}
{"text":"A fancy vegan place! Absolutely love the interior. It's very classy and chic and a great place for a night out or to celebrate an occasion. I came here with my friends (none of whom are vegan) to celebrate my birthday.   Service was good, despite having a larger party. Just in case anyone is wondering, they don't give you anything if it's your birthday. They'll add a candle if you order a dessert though.   I think the location is also ideal. There is a green P parking nearby which doesn't cost an arm and a leg.   The food here is delicious. Everything we ordered was good. We tried some truffle fries (absolutely delicious, don't leave without ordering!) and cauliflower tots (also delicious but WAY too overpriced) to start. I had a Thai salad as my main and boy was it filling! It was also very good. The chocolate terarrium for dessert was nothing special for me. Don't order this just because people say it's good. If you're not a fan of those types of desserts normally, it won't blow you away. I also had the blueberry kombucha which was a summer special. I don't think it was anything special. I'd have been happier with a GTs. Drinks were way too overpriced, even for Toronto.   Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals, even though they were neither vegan or vegetarian so it seems like a great place to bring a group of mixed diets.   I'd definitely come back here. Maybe skip the cauliflower tots and try a different dessert and main! The pizza looked sooo good. Already planning my next meal!   The only reason for a 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because of the prices. Some things are reasonable but others are extremely overpriced. That being said, you could probably find something for your budget here if you're scared of the prices."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by some of the names on the menu. Everything on this menu is vegan friendly. There is no meat or dairy on any of the dishes. The waitress stated multiple times that everything on the menu is to be tasted as it's own and not to be a \"imitation.\" However, it does look similar to cheese or normal meat. So isn't that imitation? For a Vegan restaurant, this is a great place to eat at. The atmosphere is fantastic and the meals are all fulfilling.   As far as price ranges, it's not too heavy. The meals are on smaller plates so sharing is caring. They range about $10-$20 a plate."}
{"text":"This place has been transformed from the old Pangea into this plant based/vegan gold mine. There's definitely a shortage of good higher end vegan/vegetarian options in the city. The shutting down of Grasslands was a huge loss, but now there's Planta and the menu is by far interesting, large, and excellent. The best part is their dessert menu also knocks it out of the park. The fact that the restaurant is so big, makes it a perfect spot to celebrate or to have extended family meals at.   Looking forward to many meals here."}
{"text":"First vegan restaurant experience in Toronto and they have set the bar high! The decor is tasteful and classy with rose gold accents, white walls, nature-esque wallpaper with green indoor plants everywhere to go with the meatless theme. There are also two hammocks you can sit on at the entrance with your friends to take pictures for the insta. The food here is obviously delicious. Most notably the watermelon poke, avocado lime cheesecake and young coconut Thai. I thought the watermelon poke came with raw fish like other poke bowls I've tried but then I realized they substituted the fish with watermelon cause duhhh vegan! Stupid me. I don't know if the watermelon poke was worth it at $13.25 a pop with literally 6 cubes of watermelon in there but I loved it anyways. The citrus soya complimented the greens and watermelon so well.   The avocado lime cheesecake was innovative as I've never tried avo in cheesecake form before. The cream cheese kinda overpowered the avo and same with the lime but the medley is lovely regardless as sweet and sour desserts is my jam.   The young coconut Thai was really aesthetically pleasing because it was presented in a bed of ice and in half a coconut with toasted almond slivers on the side.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto for the first time, my boyfriend and I were so stoked that there were so many vegan options in the area. When we woke up on Sunday morning, we wanted brunch! We found Planta on Yelp and as it was only a 5-10 minute walk from the Park Hyatt, we were on our way! We weren't disappointed at all! The Chicken-fried Mushrooms were so crispy and buttery it was heaven literally. We also had the Planta burger and the banana pancakes and everything was so delicious! I wish we lived in Toronto just so we could come to Planta! My favorite vegan restaurant ever!cannot wait to come back again"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday with my fiancé who is vegetarian for her birthday. As expected the restaurant was packed even for a weekday so fortunately we had made reservations Prior. We were promptly seated.  For a vegan this place is blessed as all the food options are made vegan friendly - even the pizza is made of cashew mozzarella and gluten free. First off the ginger drink although quite pricey at 14 bucks is excellent and I would highly recommend it if you are looking for a unique cocktail. Next for apps we had ordered the corn hot dog -which was pretty good even for a typical meat eater. I would give it 8/10 and would have preferred that the wiener be inside the bun rather than on top (minor point). We also ordered the kimchi dumplings which I liked since they were crispy but my fiancé found it too oily for her tastes. Next we ordered the habibi salad which according to the vegetarian was very good. I personally found the faffel type balls to be too dry. Next we also ordered the Italian job pizza - which was pretty good but not the same as a normal pizza made with real cheese. Finally for desert we got the chocolate terrataium. The desert was actually very good and I would recommend it and would order it again if I went back. Overall this a great treat for those who are vegan and vegetarian."}
{"text":"I had been looking for a great plant based restaurant in Toronto for a while. Someone suggested Planta and I was so excited to try it! The women that were at the front were so nice!!!!Then......There was our waitress-she was so unhelpful, pretty rude and very inattentive. Our reservation was for 10pm we wanted to order something around 10:45 and she was like 'kitchen is closed you can't order anything else' ummm what?! I had to ask for water several times not to mention it took 10 minutes to bring some lemon. And she Never asked how the food was. The food was pretty good but the service was awful!!! I wanted to love this place but the customer service was awful!!"}
{"text":"The wait is finally over my vegan friends :D Chase Hospitality Group has launched their most recent creation, Planta, in the heart of Yorkville. I have been following their instagram for updates and finally I'm here to try this 100% plant-based cuisine :) For a Sunday evening, it was already buzzing with people.  The decor was classic yet modern with an elegent flare. The atmosphere was relaxing... felt like stepping into an oasis :) Our server, Melissa was very friendly and helpful with our drinks and food order. Vegan is still a very new concept for me... and I really appreciate all the effort Chef David Lee and his team put into each dish.  We ordered the Cauliflower tots with truffle parmesan and lemon aioli to start and I absolutely loved them! The flavours were spot on. It tasted a bit like hash brown - crispy outside and soft on the inside ^^ Must order!  The Broccoli fried rice was not exactly what I have expected. I was literally expecting a hearty bowl of rice with kimchi, tofu and the smoked mushroom bacon lol. The rice was actually crispy hence 'fried' rice but it was also drenched in soy sauce on the bottom... I didn't like the saltiness as much. Go easy on the soy sauce!  Crab cakes! Oh man.. such an interesting combination of texture and flavours. The creamy white sauce paired with the 'meat' and herbs salad was delicious! The chef had mimic the visual of crab cakes down to a T - such amazing work and it was quite enjoyable.  Avocado lime cheesecake with raspberry sorbet was refreshing. The pistachio and shavings were a very nice touch and the sweet raspberry sorbet balanced out the tartness of the cheesecake :)  Overall, a very fine upscale, vegan experience. Can't wait to come back and explore more dishes! Sunday brunch will be available starting Oct 2, 2016... my family is going to love this ^^"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. But our server was god awful. Never cleaned off our table, would disappear for 30 minutes at a time, we had to flag her down multiple times. Seemed like she REALLY didn't want to be there. Totally unacceptable in any establishment, but especially one that is higher end dining."}
{"text":"Update: They've removed the bourbon sour from the menu but you can still request it.  Now the kimchi dumplings are spring rolls and they just aren't as good. At $11 definitely not worth the 2 small spring rolls that you get.   The kale caesar was disappointing, creamy, but bland. The search continues. The best vegan caesar I've found in Toronto is oddly at an Indian restaurant on St. Clair West, that isn't even a vegan restaurant. So random.  Still can't bring myself to try the carrot dogs for $18. Its two carrots in a bun! Other people must love it because its still on the menu!  At this price point, I just want better food. Unless I'm paying for the decor and vibe, which is admittedly great. I recommend this place for drinks and apps/lighter fare only."}
{"text":"Ordered the Bianca pizza, tried a cauliflower tot, had the chocolate terrarium and avocado lime for dessert. First of all, the tot is supposed to be very popular, I thought it was just ok. It was Annie soggy on the inside, and the flavour was Annie bland in my opinion. As for the pizza, the cream sauce was delicious and I love the cauliflower in it, however personally I don't think the olives go well with the rest of the flavours. Some grilled pineapple would've paired better with the spicy flavour. As for the dessert, the chocolate terrarium was amazing. Perfect blend of soft and crunchy textures. Didn't like the avocado lime cheesecake at all, the coconut flakes in the base was very overpowering. All in all, a bit overpriced in my opinion, but great service and decor."}
{"text":"The interior design of this restaurant is really stunning. We had great service here and the overall atmosphere was nice. However, I didn't enjoy my burger. It was dry and the ingredients didn't make a pleasant combination. Also, my friend said her truffle macaroni was too tense, making it really hard for her to finish the dish. I believe the crab cakes were okay. We each ordered a pistachio rose milk. I wouldn't recommend it if you're not very opened minded in trying new things. It had a very gingery taste for some reason. Overall, I feel like their food is overpriced. I've definitely had better quality food at other vegetarian restaurants. Pretty disappointed with the experience."}
{"text":"Never in a million years did I think I would enjoy vegan food, but I can't believe how great Planta made their food. Came here with a vegetarian friend and was excited to try something like this after seeing Yelp reviews. The entrance is small and quaint, but once inside, it's beautifully done! Great decor with high ceilings and overall a great vibe to the place. Ordered the cauliflower tots which were AMAZING, a burger, which was juicy, and the Italian job pizza. Out of everything, I think the pizza tasted the most \"vegan\" to me, but everything was still delicious. Would probably come back here again and recommend even meat lovers to try it at least once. Note: it's not the cheapest place, but you're paying for the experience as well."}
{"text":"\"I would eat here all the time and I'm not even vegan\" - my girlfriend.    Things I thought were awesome in particular:  kimchi dumplings, queso dip, frenchie pizza and the lettuce wraps.    Things meh:"}
{"text":"Had a great brunch experience here.  They have a large selection in menu from burger to pancakes.. Love their juice and smoothie but drinks are on the pricey side.  Restaurant have lovely decor, and food is very flavorful, and tasty."}
{"text":"5/5 for food, ambiance and service. I was skeptical because I really like my meat. Came for a girls night out and it was absolutely delicious. We had the habibi salad, Italian job pizza and the burger to share. Although everything was good, everyone's favourite was the burger. Already made another reservation to go back soon."}
{"text":"Planta is good for: - When you're on a \"cleanse\" and you want to be \"healthy\" - good for making yourself feel better about going out to eat  - Brunch with your girlfriends because of the optionality of shareable plates (ask and reserve the round table in the centre of the restaurant for optimal brunch seating) - When you want to take some fire Instas (Planta has rose gold chairs, rose gold utensils, palm tree wallpaper, and nice plating - what more do you need?)  However, aside from the nice decor, the food is nothing special. Cauliflower tator tots were a highlight. Pizza is decent but don't come running to Planta if you're craving the real thing.  Overall, worth a visit to try some vegan food but I personally wouldn't come back regularly.  DELIVERY REVIEW:  Spaghettoni Pasta - 3/5 Bland for my liking, nothing special  Steamed Broccoli - 3/5  Well this one is my fault, would not recommend paying 5+ dollars for broccoli - lesson learned  Kimchi Fried Rice - 3/5  Has a mild kimchi flavour, doesn't compare to true kimchi fried rice"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints ! The only place I've found with a perfect Vegan Lox bagel.  Awesome brunch, lunch, and dinner menu. Such a nice interior ; and killer drinks and cocktails! Check out these photos"}
{"text":"After moving into the area, a girlfriend and I decided to try all the local, healthy restaurants  in the area (think kupfert, live organic, IQ, etc). We added planta to the list, and have revisited a few times now.   While I don't think anyone can claim that the food is bad, especially considering all of the creative meat and dairy substitutes, I do think it's very heavy and maybe a bit underwhelming. My expectation was that it would taste super healthy and light, but found myself feeling really heavy and tired afterwards.   Here's what I've tried:   The truffle fries (8.5/10) - Delicious, no complaints here.  The Italian Job (8.5/10) - Also delicious, would re-order.  Lettuce Wraps (7/10) - Good, however I wish the greens were sliced.  Tacos (6.5/10) - I really, really hated the texture of the taco tortilla.  Cauliflower Tots - (6/10) I've heard such wonderful things about these, that I expected to be blown away. I was not. They're fine, but also very heavy and the parm tastes somewhat acidic.  Habibi Salad (5/10) Something just didn't taste right here. The lentils were hard, and the falafel wasn't great.   For dessert, we ordered a chocolate terrarium to share. Again, very heavy but equally delicious for a vegan dessert.   My favourite part of the entire meal was the pistachio steamed mylk, although it was brought to the table lukewarm. Even still, I would re-order this soul-soothing glass of mylk goodness.   Again, the food was mostly okay to good-ish, but nothing felt light or cleansing by any means.   All that said, their decor is a clean 10/10. The restaurant is visually appealing - a beautiful interior, mid century with an emphasis on modern, and rose gold accents. It looks clean and inviting, the perfect girlfriend dinner spot.   Would I go back? Sure! It's right by my house, it's beautiful, and it's vegan. Will I expect a life changing culinary experience? No. Most things are just okay, maybe good if i'm starving."}
{"text":"Too bad we didn't go twice!  Great vibe, great ambiance, great decor. Good location.   We had so many cocktails and so many dishes I think I can safely say that we tried them all.   We were brought by two non-vegan friends as a vegan couple and just loved everything about it. Wish the dishes were a tad larger.   No complaints on the food whatsoever. Try everything."}
{"text":"Really good food, I mean really good. Interesting, creative and different flavours. They type of thing one used to expect at fine dining an experience you'd never had before but except fine dining doesn't seem to do that anymore; planta takes your taste buds on holidays to somewhere far flung, exotic where you don't knowing what to expect around the next corner. This restaurant is one of Toronto's best."}
{"text":"4.5  I love Planta!! So I've heard a lot of hype around it, and decided to venture out one cold snowy day and was not disappointed.   Firstly I like how courteous the staff are in accommodating you requests. Was going to be a bit late but they happily pushed the reservation to a later time despite the restaurant being very busy.   Though a small interior, Planta boasts soaring ceilings and amazing decor. The ambience definitely makes the trip worth it if it's a distance for you.   Went with a couple of friends and we decided to split a couple of items, a Bianca pizza, coconut ceviche and truffle fries. The portion sizing of the fries was quite large...the ceviche was more small plates/tapas style but it was AMAZING. Pricey but so incredibly good - the flavours were unlike anything I've tasted before and it was even more cool that the dish was vegan and made from coconut.   The pizza was also good. Standard veggies but what really got me was the fact that the cheese was made from cashews and tasted so real!   Definitely want to try a Planta burger next time because those looked awesome. The restaurant is on the pricey side, but definitely a nice spot to visit. The service was also great and they easily split the bill anyway you'd like.   Thanks for an awesome experience, Planta!"}
{"text":"Plant based fantastic, loved the Coconut Ceviche & Habibi salad! Really enjoyed the food and atmosphere, was definitely above my expectations!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars... beautiful atmosphere, great service with some nice flavours coming out of the kitchen.  I do understand some of the other reviews when it comes to value.  It's steep ... you are in Yorkville but it's still a pretty penny.  I'm mostly vegan... I love a balanced meal that leans heavily on vegetables.  I never did like the mock dishes where vegetables and grains pretend to be meat.  In Toronto, it can be hard to find that restaurant that gives vegetables it's due... especially in a nicer atmosphere.  So for me, Planta has always been on my radar especially seeing beautiful their instagram shots have been.  The thing that kept me away for a bit was the bi-polar reviews.    One consistent string of thought from the reviews is \"Planta is gorgeous\".  It really is... it has a completely different vibe and aesthetic from most Toronto restaurants... including the new ones.  The stark contrast of the black and white mosaics coupled with deep golden russet wooden tones are just beautiful.  The splashes of dark emerald plants and gleaming bronze metallic tones adds to the warmth.  To say Planta has an amazing atmosphere and vibe is an understatement.  I have to commend Planta for also not cramming in the tables.  People can walk around the restaurant without bumping into another table or a person.  Novelty, you dont want to wait for someone to walk down an aisle... you can both go!  You can easily have a conversation here and not worry someone else is listening in.  Also, they have a great playlist... I was constantly trying not to dance at times.  It leans towards hip hop but still top ten friendly.   On this Sunday I went for brunch, the service here was very friendly and nicely checking in.  I spotted a fair number of staff and they were constantly moving and keeping the food coming to the tables.  I like ours in particular as she seemed to love the menu and had some great thoughts on the dishes we were ordering.  Definitely take their insights as some of the dishes descriptions are not quite as accurate as what the staff may say.  Each item below can add the following line... Definitely pricier than other spots I've had the same dish in Toronto.  I could put it over and over again but it would get mind numbing.  Dirty Chai Cashew milk latte - YES!  What a great perk up first thing in the morning.  Rich and creamy with a healthy dose of real spices ... I can taste cinnamon, cardamom, and perhaps a bit of star anise?  I'm not sure about the last one but I do love this.  I didnt taste the espresso outright so either it was a small shot of a really nice pull.  I still love my Village Juicery version more but this was very good.  4/5  Chicken Fried Mushrooms taco - Unique take on bringing vegetables in a taco.  I'm not sure this went over as intended.  The pico de gallow and cashew crema was nice and rich but it was placed on the bottom of the taco before the fried mushrooms... so it completely soaked the single taco shell.  You couldnt eat this without it falling apart completely in your hands before your first bite.  Execution... not quite there.  As for the flavours, it was light... definitely missing salt.  I do find the oyster mushrooms light and though it was a nice crispy batter, it needs a flavour.  A touch on the bland side.  3/5  Habibi salad - This was recommended by the staff and it was a great insight.  This was the best dish of the brunch. The tahini dressed was nicely lightly coating each leaf and added a nutty creaminess to the leaves.  It looks like falafels but they call it split pea fritters were freshly fried crisp and a wonderful flavour.  The sumac, mint, and za'atar spices just adding a nice layer of flavour.  The lentils were nice and tender as well.  Overall, it's a generous dish and a good size to share with 2 people for an app.  Visually it's beautiful.  Personally, a shake of salt on the fritters would have done it wonders but that seems to be a theme from the kitchen.  4/5  Truffle fries - This is supposedly one of their best sellers.  Who doesnt love a good bowl of fries?  I thought these were fried well... not as crispy as I would have liked but it was pretty good.  One take away I learned, the vegan almond Parmesan cheese is a case of mistaken identity.  Parmesan has a distinct funky and pungent taste in a good way.  The vegan version may have looked like it from afar but taste wise, I dont even know how to categorize it... it didnt taste like anything.  It wasn't even in the realm of savoury or salty.  Also, the fries needed a shake up of salt... It was definitely missing that.  3.5/5  Aside from the price point, this spot is worth the try for any vegan or vegetarian... actually anyone who is curious on how a restaurant would showcase vegetables in a flavourful way.  It shouldn't have to be stuck in grittier spots like Kensington or small spots like Parkdale.  It can be in a refined, attractive, and upscale spots.  Just understand this is Yorkville and set your expectations."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Visited them for lunch today, and was pleasantly surprised they were completely vegan. From my experience eating out vegan, it's been tough to find somewhere where the food is not so dense and grainy. We ordered the Frenchie pizza and ceviche. Pizza was magnificent. It had a mushroom sauce, and dough was nice and light. Coconut ceviche was delicious. Coconut was dusted lightly with paprika and chilli pepper, an excellent combo.  Other then the food, the service was great and decode was inviting.  Would HIGHLY recommend !"}
{"text":"Gorgeous space, delicious vegan food. Neither my friend nor I are vegan but we were impressed by the food here. Fried mushrooms were crisp, earthy, perfectly fried. My spaghetti was text book al dente and the zucchini cream was lick the bowl worthy. The lemon poppyseed cake had no discernible lemon taste but was super coconutty, which was fine by me as I love coconut but not exactly what I ordered. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at a vegan restaurant. Came here for lunch with 8 other people on a Sunday. We had a reservation and it was packed. The menu is great, lots of selections, I tried the pizza. The food is delicious and after eating half the pizza, I was pretty much full. At first didn't know if the food was going to be great without any meat options but it was delicious. One think that was annoying is the music is way too loud and I couldn't hear half the people in our group. The music selection is crap as well, you feel like sitting in a techno/dance club. People come here to socialize and talk not listen to crappy music playing loud in the background. Hence, I gave it 4 stars. Service overall was great."}
{"text":"I would imagine for a vegan/vegetarian food they would have lots of herbs and spices to play with but they didn't. We ordered the kimchi spring rolls, coconut ceviche, eggplant lasagna and frenchie pizza. Each dish was bland, we had to ask for hot sauce to finish the one slice of pizza we ate. I would not recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"I am probably the exact opposite of a vegan however I have enjoyed my meals at Planta both times that I've come here. The first time I came we had the cauliflower tots and the hotdog. The cauliflower tots are amazing if you love truffles which I do. They melt in your mouth and don't taste anything like cauliflower. I ordered the hotdog because I was really interested to see how they were going to make a hotdog vegan. It arrived and was a carrot in a bun which I thought was hilarious. They did make it taste quite smokey though which I was surprised about because it tasted more like a hotdog than it did a carrot. I ordered it with the truffle fries which was an excellent decision. The next time I came here I got the eggplant lasagna which was very good and filling. I'd recommend anyone in Toronto to give this restaurant a try because I think they will be pleasantly surprised with the food. This restaurant is always busy though so a reservation is needed but thankfully they are on OpenTable."}
{"text":"Planta is a blessed place, everyone is lovely, the air smells amazing, the cups & silverware are fun and the water has a hint of lemon. The food hurts. Got 'the frenchie' pizza which was OK, barely had any cheese. Too doughy, decently cooked on parts. Kimchi dumplings were best dish, served with an excellent soy-based sauce. Queso dip had lots of fresh notes and hints of lemon on steamed/pickled veggies; no queso. Tortilla chips (corn) were pretty nice and fresh, maybe a tad over-seasoned.  The menu lists things like 'bacon' and 'mylk', I found this structurally problematic, call it what it is, there are plenty of good vegan ingredients, be transparent!   I wanted this place to taste a lot better than it did, really nice place to be, located in one of the best neighborhoods on the globe."}
{"text":"As soon as you step in, hipster California vibes are evident: palm tree and geometric wallpaper accent walls, rose gold cutlery, in-wall plant installations.  Cauliflower Tots, $10 - Fairly enjoyable bites; for some reason I was reminded of Takoyaki (probably the fried batter and vegan mayo-like sauce combo)  Coconut Ceviche, $14 - I think this was my favourite. The coconut meat slivers could pass as fish in texture and the different elements of the dish was refreshing  Sweet Mess Tacos, $14 - Lack lustre and forgettable  Eggplant Lasagna, $23 - 'Meatiest' tasting dish. The saucy smoked tofu and almond parmesan pulled off a savoury ground beef flavour that was comforting  Planta has interesting and creative dishes with most flavours down pat. Sadly, I found the portions quite small and overpriced across the board."}
{"text":"Planta is AMAZING. It definitely lives up to all the hype.  I was sceptical going in, thinking people were just overly excited about having a nice vegan establishment in Toronto. I was wrong and I am SO glad I was! The restaurant was beautiful inside, with high ceilings, modern colours and accents, and hip furniture. It gives off a very LA feel.   We reserved ahead of time (which I recommend- the place was PACKED!) and were seated immediately. We ordered the cauliflower tots, the Planta burger, and the pizza of the month on gluten free crust- a Greek pizza, and the terrarium dessert. The tots were really good, especially with the squeeze of lemon. The Planta burger was excellent- it was the best vegan burger we have ever had. The pizza, though, is what blew me away. Being a Greek pizza, it had olives, sun-dried tomatoes, red onions, and feta (vegan, of course, made of almonds). WOW. I couldn't get enough of it. The feta was AMAZING and was the best vegan cheese I'd ever had. The flavours were wonderful and I was surprised that it wasn't on their regular menu! The dessert was the perfect ending to our meal. It wasn't overly sweet, and it was beautiful to look at.   We had an amazing time at Planta. The service and food are top notch. I can't wait to come back. Make a reservation, get dressed up, and get ready for some amazing plant-based food. Well done, Planta."}
{"text":"Finally went to Planta! The space is absolutely beautiful, such a cute spot with stunning design concepts throughout the restaurant. The place was absolutely packed on a Friday evening so you definitely need to book ahead if you want to dine here.   Although the prices are quite high for vegan eats, some dishes were worth it. It's ideal to split items here as everything is nicely portioned and shareable. We tried the cauliflower tots, coconut ceviche, special of the day pizza, lime avocado cheesecake, truffle fries and banoffee pie special. Everything was quite tasty and I wasn't missing the meat or cheese. Next time I would definitely try one of their salads, they looked amazing!   I tried two cocktails. The carrot collins and aloe views (I forget the name). The Collins was very good, not overly powerful carrot juice taste, the tequila was nicely present. The aloe cocktail was $14.25 and what a waste!!! The entire thing was full of crushed ice and some ginger beer. Could barely taste any alcohol in it.  Such a waste of money. Make sure to get a cocktail that is worth the money!! The bourbon one was great, tried a sip of it from my friend.   Planta is definitely a hot spot. Although some vegans out there might find it a trendy overpriced place, I think it's worth checking out as some of the dishes are really delicious!!"}
{"text":"An excerpt from a longer review...  \"Like the cauliflower tots, the Planta Burger with a side of spiced fries ($19.95) could have fooled a carnivore. Lee spent years perfecting the recipe. What surprised me as I bit into the dense burger for the first time last year was the deep flavour profile. It was accented by queso and mushroom bacon, which lent a smoky flavour to the burger. Insider tip: If you like the burger, you can now get it for half the price at Planta's new burger-only outpost, Planta Burger.  Although I wanted the burger again, we opted for lighter fare and ordered the Kale Caesar ($15.35) and Harvest Salad ($16.95). The Kale Caesar was a predictably satisfying mix of baby kale topping with mushroom bacon, pickled onions, almond parmesan and sprouts. The Harvest Salad--a deep bowl of spiralized zucchini, roasted squash, kale and cabbage slaw, crushed cashews, pumpkin seeds and creamy mustard dressing--started off on a high note, until I almost ate a bug that was making its home in my cabbage slaw. Dégoutant! Our server apologized (as if it was her fault) and kindly waived the salad from the bill. She allowed me to choose another item free of charge...so naturally, I chose the burger!...\""}
{"text":"The place is very fancy and morden. A lot of natural light, makes the atmosphere welcoming and soothing. The service is great. In terms of food, I was hoping to be converted to be a vegetarian when I step out, but it didn't happen. I think the chef tried too hard to brand vegan food as a cool thing, or at least set the expectation bar very high. Almost every dish on the menu is bragging about how many ingredients they are made of - of course would be a good thing if the combination makes sense. The cauliflower tots taste like mashed potatoes to me. The watermelon poke was... disappointing - no clue of watermelon taste but overshadowed by avocado and random rice chip. The frenchie pizza absolutely failed to please any of us - the sauce-like thing either made from eggplant or squash made the texture very uncomfortable on a pizza, almost feels like some kind of puke (sorry but that's how I feel). The harvest salad was ok. The truffle fries was my favorite dish out of the above, but the potato wedges from Tim Horton's will do the magic to me just fine."}
{"text":"My love for Planta knows no bounds. I've had the chocolate terrarium, friends, and I may never be the same again. Delightful in both texture and taste, not to mention beautifully presented, this might win a spot in the Vegan Dessert Hall of Fame. I'm not a chocoholic by any means, but I do believe I shed tears of amazement after the very first spoonful of rich chocolate \"dirt\" crumbs, decadent mousse and peanut butter cream, \"honeycomb\" bits and *pause for reverent silence* Gold. Dusted. Peanuts (I kid you not). The slightly tart, slightly sweet bits of raspberry add a less sweet, but just as delicious note so that the entire shebang isn't overwhelmingly sweet and rich as it sounds.   What preceded this wonder? I couldn't pass another go at the cauliflower tots (so delicious) and I tried a different pizza (as much as I wanted the Frenchie again), the Italian Job. I prefer the Frenchie. The dill on the Italian job, while uniquely risqué, was overwhelming. I much prefer the more traditional basil as the herb of choice for Italian anything."}
{"text":"Planta is the relatively new vegan kid on the block. Solid 5 yums from me!   The restaurant's interior is stunning. The ambiance and service were impeccable. Flavours are not sacrificed by the plant-based nature of the menu. Instead, it was both imaginative and creative. Every plate was Instagram worthy. It was a work of art!  Our table of 6 offered multiple dishes to share. Cauliflower Tots ($9.75) with truffle parmesan were a hit at the table. Fried Kimchi Dumplings ($10.25) with hot chili oil were also a crowd pleaser. My favourite was the Coconut Ceviche ($13.75) with avocado, corn nuts, lime, and tortilla chips. I adored the interplay of textures between softness of coconut flesh, freshness of avocado and lime with crispy crunchy tortilla chips. It was light and refreshing!   The beauty of dining with six others is the ability to sample everyone's entrees! Together, we ordered the Bianca ($ 17) with cauliflower, cashew mozzarella, potatoes, capers, caramelized onions, olives, and rosemary chili oil, Crab Cakes ($21.75) with hearts of palm, spinach, coconut milk, and warm spices, Lettuce Wraps ($18.75) with chicken fried oyster mushrooms, rice noodles, pomelo, mango, chili, and Thai basil, 18 Carrot Dog ($17) with fries, mustard, sauerkraut, and dill pickle, and last, but not least Thai Noodle ($15.25) green papaya, carrots, cucumber, mango, nori, tofu, shitake mushroom, kaffir lime, ginger, basil, coriander, mint, puffed rice, cashews, and chili dressing.   The Crab Cakes with hearts of palm was by far my favorite. Similar to the tapas, I adore the dish's textures, composure and thoughtfulness.   For drinks, four of us at the table ordered orange ginger ($6), two of us reordered another cup before the end of the meal. This is a true testament to the deliciousness of the drink! Putting your orange ginger (money) where your mouth is.   Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would recommend Planta to vegans and to the non-vegan world."}
{"text":"Planta is the type of restaurant I'm sure vegans have been dreaming about for years. Finally there's a place that a vegan will feel proud to take a non-vegan on a date. The restaurant has a clean, and upscale aesthetic and most importantly, treats the food with respect. Full disclosure, I'm not a vegan (or even a vegetarian) and I do not feel like I've been cheated out of a good meal at Planta.  I've been twice and both times I've been impressed with my choices. Cauliflower tots are a must and the lasagna is fantastic. The drinks are done very well and if you forgot to make a reservation and can't get a seat, there's a small bar area where you can indulge in their beverages including a great vegan caesar. The staff are friendly but somewhat oddly are dressed too casually for the ambiance it appears Planta is going for. Still, this place is a solid 4.5/5. You will not be disappointed regardless of your eating beliefs!"}
{"text":"Fancy vegan spot that is a bit overhyped.   Food: good but nothing amazing. We got the salad, the vegan bean burger and the falafels. The vegan bean burger was probably the best thing we had there!   Decor: quite cute and fancy but again, a bit much for the quality of food.   Price: $$$$ and not worth it.   It's one of those places you try once but will likely not return (unless a friend has a party there and you're forced to return)."}
{"text":"Pricey. The salad wasn't good. The other plates we ordered were ok but small. I left hungry. I expected much more from Planta."}
{"text":"Decent spot, attempts creative dishes but seemingly more for the visual Instagram appeal than taste or texture. Planta burger is tasty, but the lentil element is excessive and makes the patty a little mushy. The \"cheese\" didn't taste like cheese at all, as opposed to the nutritional yeast sprinkle on other dishes, which does. Tajín fries are better than the truffle oil ones. Drinks are fun, and cucumber water is free. Cappuccino with cashew/almond milk doesn't hit the spot for someone who likes a moderate amount of lactose in their diet."}
{"text":"First foremost, I have to say the interior of this restaurant is totally up my alley!! Love the tropical wallpapers, the unique brass/copper chairs and the even the plates and cutleries were so lovely I almost wanted to take them home!   When you come here you MUST try one of their original cocktails. They use cold press juice as ingredient and I particularly loved the \"Peach, Don't Kill my vibe\" drink. The subtle aroma of roses from the rose gin was very elegant and not sweet at all (for a peach)  Food wise, I really enjoyed the watermelon poke (highly recommended). The watermelon almost tasted like tuna believe it or not, thanks to the perfect seasoning with soy and avocado. The main course, lasagna was so good it's hard to believe that it's fully vegan!! I can't to dairy and so this gave me relief. Gotta love cashew cheese! I shared this with my girlfriend and it was perfect amount. The squash made it filling.  Dessert we had chocolate terranium and this one I have to say was a little too sweet for my taste. Next time I would love to try the coconut one with chia seeds and mango sorbet.   Overall service was excellent and I would definitely come back here. Wish there were more places like this. Don't forget to make reservations as it fills up fast!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times have been left unimpressed. I don't get the hype and the 5 star reviews for this restaurant. The ambience of the restaurant is what I guess saves this restaurant from a two star review. I don't think that the quality or the flavours of the food are that great. This time around I had their pizza and I've had better pizza from pizza nova. The staff are also really hard to get a hold of. When they pour your water, half of it spills all over the place. There are tons of other restaurants offering better flavoured food. Would I come back? No thanks."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and a great atmosphere! We have spent the week in Toronto and tried a different Vegan restaurant each day and this one was by far the best!"}
{"text":"One of the best plant-based fine dining experiences we have ever experienced. The food is expertly prepared and the flavors are exquisite. We had the Queso dip, truffle fries, Italian pizza and lettuce wraps along with the chocolate terrarium for dessert. The portions are tapas style and served piping hot."}
{"text":"4.5 Was recommended by my sister in law who is a meat eater. She said she usually doesnt like vegan food but she loves this place.  Well there you go, I had to try it.  I always find it interesting how they can be more creative with their ingredients and bring up a combo of interesting flavors. It can be hit or miss - well this is a hit.  We ordered the recommended fried mushroom app and the king corn pizza. Both were a definite hit, other than the corn puree sticking to my teeth pretty tasty!! And the gluten free crust was thin and tasty with some chewy parts - not the usual gf crusts that taste like cardboard. It was good - probably could not even tell it was gf.  We decided to go against the recommendations and try the lasagna because it sounded so yummy and I was curious to see how they make that cheese (yet no cheese) kinda taste - \"almond parmasean\". Well it was ok. It was good but not something I would order again.  We felt like having a non alco drink to go with so I got the golden tumeric drink (spicy!!! hot) and my friend got the Beet punch - that was good and refreshing and tasty.  Staff was friendly, though they did tell us after us being 15 min late for our reservation that they had another party coming in 1.5 hours. However we did go overtime and no one bothered us about it and we did not feel rushed. At that point there were a lot of tables free.  We did have to ask for a refill of water. So in some ways good they weren't hovering but we did get thirsty.  Love the classy light decor and the fact they can open the whole front window as well during the summer.  I will def come back to this place and reco to others! We were even full surprisingly and did not have that usual feeling of craving meat."}
{"text":"Food is meh. My salad was heavily vinergered. My companion's appetizer was tiny. Service was unprofessional. Waitress kept handing me food across my companion's face. No one offered to take my coat. Decor was 1960s' recc room. Only saving grace was the wine list: innovative and well-priced, altho very few by the glass"}
{"text":"The food was very good. We had the dumplings, noodles, quinoa and the avocado cheese cake.   A few minor things to complain about: - If you're sitting anywhere near the door, it can be pretty cold despite the curtains. - Service could be a little faster. - No surprise here, but prices are pretty high.   In terms of vegetarian restaurants in Toronto, I still prefer Vegetarian Haven on Baldwin Street."}
{"text":"Just when I thought things couldn't get worse...  We decided that since our first visit occurred shortly after Planta opened, we would give it another shot. There would be no way the service could have been as poor as our first encounter. So, we went for lunch.  We were seated promptly and immediately asked the waitress to help us choose a NON fried, NON salad item from the appetizer selections that we could share since we had each ordered a salad as a main.  She suggested the butternut squash and mushrooms.  Great!  Ten minutes later an arugula salad topped with squash and mushrooms arrived.  Although salty, it was tasty but we we did ask our waitress why she suggested a salad to start when our mains were each a salad.  She just stood there and smiled. (NOTE: The menu mentions nothing about the squash and mushrooms being served upon a bed of arugula.  Hmmm...)  Thirty five minutes later as we watched table after table receive their hot entrees (might I add they were patrons who arrived AFTER we did) we began to wonder why our salads had not arrived.  Once again, we asked our waitress what was going on.  She looked dumbfounded and walked away as we watched her approach a young man at the front of the restaurant.  They exchanged some words, he turned around to look at us and then he walked directly to the back of the restaurant toward the kitchen.  As we sat there hungry and frustrated, we decided at that moment that this was a most disorganized and thoughtless establishment and it was time to leave. Five minutes later, as we were getting our coats on, the young man arrived at our table with two salads in his hands.  When we asked about the wait, he said there really wasn't an excuse excuse - it was simply a \"mix-up\".  At that point we told him how this very same situation we encountered only a month prior and we would not tolerate it AGAIN.  We offered to pay for what we had eaten but he apologized for the situation and told us just to leave.  Planta, it is so hard to believe you are a part of the Chase group.  In fact, you call yourself the CHASE HOSPITALITY GROUP.  There was nothing hospitable about our visits. The breakdown in communication is terribly apparent.  After my first review, someone from your restaurant reached out to me privately for my email address so they could chat with me further.  I immediately provided it.  Did anyone ever get back to me?  Nope!  As a long time vegetarian, I had high hopes for your (supposedly) upscale restaurant that would cater to my eating habits.  You have disappointed me and my family and we will never return."}
{"text":"The place is really nice. Super neat and clean. Gives off really calming vibes. The decor was nice. The food was absolutely incredible. Really really delicious. I loved everything my friends and I ordered. The one take back was the service. The waiters were awful. They were cold and rude and not welcoming at all. Our visit was made less enjoyable because of them."}
{"text":"Believe the hype...the truffle fries are LEGIT, order them as soon as you sit down. The cauliflower tots were good, but not my favorite. The queso was pretty good too, but if you're not vegan you may not like it as much. The service was wonderful, and they were incredibly accommodating despite us showing up late and changing reservation times. Other dishes, we tried the planta burger, kale salad and fried mushrooms. The burger was yummy, but the spicy fries are a little strange..a mix between a bbq and ketchup chip ? my advice is to just stick with the truffle fries! The kale salad is solid and if you love mushrooms you'll love the fried mushrooms..I mean duh their fried! Wish I had saved room for dessert..oh well, next time! Would definitely recommend planta for any vegans, vegetarians and quite honestly any diet out there! Also I love the upscale, trendy vibe, makes a great place for a girls night or a date night."}
{"text":"This plant-based restaurant is some kind of wonderful. All of the food we had was flavorfully complex, innovative, and delicious. I especially loved the lettuce wraps - the tofu/cauliflower was out of this world. The cocktail menu incorporates a lot of fresh juice, and the drinks were well-balanced and very enjoyable. To top it all off, our server was friendly, attentive, and a wonderful guide in helping us navigate the overwhelmingly appealing menu."}
{"text":"I've been to Planta a handful of times, and every time I go I enjoy myself. The decor is trendy, the staff are friendly and accommodating, and the food is delicious. I'm rating 4/5 stars because there have been some hits and misses. I recommend: the frenchie pizza, thai noodle salad, banana pancakes, and pistachio rose mylk (iced). I would avoid: the cauliflower tots (I found them to be slightly soggy and lacklustre), the habibi salad (I found the fritters to be dry), and the crab cakes (I found the flavour of the crab cakes to be mismatched from the lentil stew they were topped on). Other dishes which I've enjoyed include: the truffle fries, coconut ceviche, the bianca pizza, tofu scramble, chocolate terrarium, and chai latte (iced)."}
{"text":"The food is good but I wouldn't say it's amazing. We had the pizza, the burger, a salad, and the tots - nothing blew me away but I would go back if I was in the area. That being said the service was very quick and very friendly so no issues there. However my favourite aspect was the atmosphere and ambience which is unlike any other vegan restaurant in the area. It's a nice trendy yet casual restaurant with a great interior perfect for a nice evening dinner or maybe even a date!"}
{"text":"New fav spot! Love the vibe of the restaurant. Delicious drinks, great music, a very innovative menu list. As a vegetarian, I was in heaven. Food was a little pricey l for the portions - but a return visitor for sure! Nice for bday celebrations or group dinners."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in the city!  If you're worried about food being not as good because it's vegan - you're absolutely wrong! Planta makes phenomenal dishes. Not to mention the decor and environment is just so lovely."}
