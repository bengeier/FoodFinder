{"text":"If only they would have table service... I don't mind standing in line to order and pay for the food. But if they could just bring the food to your table it would be so much nicer. It would avoid the crowd at the counter for one. Otherwise the food is pretty standard fare for a kebab place."}
{"text":"I love and hate certain things about this place. When I went there for my birthday dinner at 8:30 pm on a Friday, it was packed - thought we weren't going to get seats. It felt overwhelmingly crowded. The food was OK. I felt like I was eating a ton of rice, wet rice actually and the kabobs were bland at times. But, overall, it was nothing amazing, but worth a try for first-timers of afghan cuisine."}
{"text":"This place is a gem of strip malls of Mississauga. The spicy half chicken is my go to."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at Bamiyan Kabab. This location I tried for the first time and just prior to closing time (around 7pm). The service was good and the food was received within 15mins. The meat was soft and tasty with the spicy afghani salsa adding an extra zinger as needed."}
{"text":"Very good food fresh and tasty, staff is friendly and atmosphere was clean and bright my only downfall was the drinks, not much varity and the pop was all canned."}
{"text":"I frequent this place for the past 2-3 years.  It seems they have changed the quality and taste of the food.  Both the meat, rice and sauces are different.  Maybe cost cutting because of the rise in food prices?   I hope they go back to how things were."}
{"text":"It  used to be a good  place.  If you  like to experience  the worst  cashier , you might try.   The   last place for  Kabob ."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for some food grilled meat, I highly recommend this place. The meats are really delicious and the extras on the side (naan, firni etc) are scrumptious. This place is always busy...a good sign. The peak times are between 8-9 pm. I have seen line ups till outside the entrance. I would suggest avoiding that hour."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple of times at all 3 locations (Mississauga, East York, and the new one in Markham). I find it to be adequate - filling for the 10-12 bucks per platter (mostly due to the massive amounts of rice though), and is okay for a quick meal. I am not entirely sure if this would be my go-to place for satiating a sudden craving for good flavourful kababs.  Dedicated to a new friend: Vivek S. = Obligatory Pun:  \"I want a KaBA-miyan\" (I won't explain the \"miyan\" part - it will be lost in translation)  FOOD: - has quite a variety (9-10 options) for the platters (kabab, rice, salad, naan) - can get the same things without the rice for a lesser price. - Apparently, the place is really well known for their chicken kabab platters. I have tried it - they ARE pretty good.   - The other options are: half-chicken (tandoori style full leg), and some beef and lamb options (cooked in different ways = chapli kabab, choppan kabab etc.) - they are good too...  - The platters are very filling as I mentioned before, but it's mostly due to the rice. A chicken tikka platter comes with around 6-7 pieces which is good.  - The chaplee kabab is quite tasty, but only comes with 2, which is NOT enough to quieten my taste buds! Some of the other exotic ones also have 2-3 pieces. I wish they would cut down on the rice and give me an extra piece (for a slightly elevated price too!) - Nothing exquisite about the salad or the naan - The rice is a little flavoured, but is otherwise quite plain (better than white steamed rice though!)  Food rating: 3.5/5  PRICE: - you can get a platter for 10-12 bucks after taxes - without rice, you can get the same thing for about 2 bucks less - for a relatively cheap dinner for decent food, it's not a bad option - For 3 people having a platter and a drink each, you're looking at approx 45 bucks incl. taxes.   Price rating: 4/5  DECOR: - Spacious - Clean - Not super loud, not super quiet. Expect families to be there with kids, and children ranging from 0-18 years! =P  - Nothing fancy - not a great option for a date or anything.   Decor rating: 3/5  SERVICE: - Standard setup where you order food, pay, get an order number and wait - it's usually pretty quick - 10 minutes or so for about 4 ppl  (not sure for very large orders though) - one thing that annoys me is that sometimes they hand out plastic cutlery which sucks when you're eating kababs. Not cool.  - but otherwise they are pretty good with catering to requests for extra sauces etc.   Service rating: 4/5  OVERALL RATING: 3 - 3.5 /5   Why to go there: - quick relatively cheap meal for something that is not McDonalds and is different from the regular quick meal places - quick lunch if you work in the area  Why not to go there: - if you want really good kababs  - not the best place for a nice cozy dinner / meal  Additional tips: - if you go with people who are willing to share stuff, get different things and try the different kababs (chicken, beef, lamb). The Afghan cuisine is definitely worth checking out. Who knows, you may end up liking their kababs a little more than I do!"}
{"text":"Usually opt for the Chopan Lamb which comes with fluffy flatbread, rice pilaf and salad.  Make sure to order their mango lassi alongside your meal. Order at the counter and wait for your number to be called."}
{"text":"This place used to be the best.  I would eat here or at paramount many times for lunch when I worked in the area.   This place has gone down hill, still it used to be the best so I have to give it at least 3 stars.   But when you got competition like Watan Kebab who's just 5 mins down the street by the burger king / Mandarin on Hurontario. It's a no brainer, they serve the exact same dishes but larger portions and the kitchen produces a consistent product which is my main issue for leaving Bamiyan and going to my new kebob place... Watan....   Sorry Bamiyan! Many good memories!"}
{"text":"Last night I went to Bamiyan in Mississauga I order the the beef tikka and it who's very dry and the portion are very small for the price I told the staff at the front that the tikka is dry she said u just need other plate because this is not dry not very good customer service and bad food will never go bag last time for me"}
{"text":"This place is always full of people no matter the time of day I show my face. The kebabs are delicious and juicy, wonderful. The prices aren't too bad and you certainly get a nice large plate of food. Seating can be a bit of a bother at times but if you live close the take away is just fine."}
{"text":"The place was almost full as usual, Ordered the Tandoori Dinner, love the mint & tomato dipping it comes with, ads extra flavour to the experience. Because of the high volume the meat is always fresh & tender. But it was mostly white meat which is not a bad thing but I prefer dark meat for kebobs & koftas.!  Over all its consistent with its quality  & taste. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"As a devoted patron over the years, all I can say is that I love this place! The concept is simple and hassle-free. Walk in, read the menu, and order - they do dine-in OR take-out, and only accept cash/debit. As you wait, typically 5-10 minutes for your order, you'll notice the interior is clean, dec'd with a few paintings supposedly representative of Afghanistan - like the famous 1985 National Geographic cover of the \"Afghan Girl\" with green eyes, and a watercolour canvas that appears to be done by an amateur artist.   As you continue to wait, you'll also be enticed by the wonderful aroma wafting through the restaurant. Still passing time, do some people watching - this place is always busy!  Finally, after the 5-10 min. mark passes from when you first ordered, your order number will be announced by one of the cashiers on a mic. - cafe. style. Run over, grab your food, and dig in to enjoy!  Yes, I do agree with the other reviewers that the rice is a bit buttered up, the naan atypical from what I'm used to (it ain't fluffy), and the focus is on the meat! But it's ALL de-lish!   Go for the tandoori kabobs if you like chicken. Like your beef? Do the chaplee kabobs - warning they may be a bit spicy for the inexperienced.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Half chicken is the best. They're in the middle of nowhere but will go back for sure.   Service is pretty fast."}
{"text":"We went there few months ago.food could be better and more flavorful.other afghani  places doing way better.so,i guess they need to work little bit harder."}
{"text":"Food is really good but the drink selection is the worst I have ever seen. It's Pepsi or Diet Pepsi. Price is fine about $13 for a meal with drink, would recommend if I could bring my own drink and wait wasn't so long."}
{"text":"The best Afghan place in town. Good prices, good portions, amazing meats. Don't let the \"Afghan\" title scare you away. The food is universal - rice, beef, chicken, salad, etc. Not spicy like South Asian food and not bland either - perfect flavouring. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"You can tell how well some restaurants do by watching their lunch business and this place is always packed. It may be obvious for some people, but if you just serve consistently good food then people will always come back. The first time I had lunch there, I stuffed my face silly with naan bread because it was soo good.   I don't know what people are saying by dirty floors and what not but after handling one of their lunch rushes, I can't blame them if there are a few lingering dirty tables.   I always order the half chicken dinner. The spices are great and the tomato salad is light and goes well with the dinner. I usually hate raw tomoatos, but I always finish their salad. And of course I always order 4 extra naan breads to go!"}
{"text":"Food is below average for an Afghan place.  Service is not friendly either.  Will not return.  Too many other places in the greater Toronto area to enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place to go to for Afghani food.  They give you big portions and the food is so good.  I believe their naan is freshly stoned baked as well...yum!  Also I really like their hot sauce they make themselves, freshly tomatoes, cilantro and whatever spices are in it.  I've been to several Afghani restaurants in Mississauga and Brampton but according to taste and freshness, this is the one!  The only thing that annoys me is the crazy lineups during lunch times.  Once I was there and the line up was so ridiculous it went out the door and  all their seats were full.  Oh well, if you love the food you have to wait for it!"}
{"text":"Mom loves chapplee kabab and I like there kafta.  It's likely that it's the best in the city comparable to paramount and café. The Naan is excellent and the brown rice is exceptionally tasteful. Often you find kebabs served with French fries but here its the most healthy menu no fried foods just grilled meat and salads. Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"What I love about this place is the consistency in quality... And it alllllways tastes great. It's not a fancy shanzy place but  My favorite place for kebab by  far."}
{"text":"If your a Kababist then u already know... I must say everything on the menu is delish! my personal fav's are the Barg kebab and the tandoori chkn. Ambiance is ok very clean and up todate decor is what you can expect. Food is on point everytime. And staff seems most willing to guide you in the direction of what type of meal your looking for.   Great Place good eats   Beg for Barg! Btw the Barg kebabs are nice cuts of fillet mignon that are ever so tender n juicy."}
{"text":"Wow!  Chose this based on Yelp reviews. Walked into the place, don't know what I was expecting, but not this!  The place was packed full with people (local to this cuisine) at 8pm on a Saturday night.  Tables were full, the line was almost to the door, people carrying trays back and forth, the kitchen was bustling.  Took 10 min to get to the front of the line, I knew what I was going to order, should have called it in.  As efficiently as the kitchen was working, and it was efficient, like a well oiled machine, it still took another 20 to get our order.  I was told this is typical for this place.  The Lamb dinner was outstanding!  The 4 think tasty cuts were tender and so full of flavor.   We recently had a lamb dinner in Greektown at a nice (read $$) restaurant, but I promise you, this place has that place beat by a mile.  The Naan was  so-so, just different in texture from what I'm used to.The tomato salad was seasoned perfectly.  The rice was ok, again, just a different texture than I prefer.  We carried out, good thing that was the plan, as seating was scarce.  I would eat here again and again.  And again and again.  You had me at kebob."}
{"text":"Aside from the insane line up, bad service and the cheap table/chairs the food is really THAT good.   It's traditional Afghan food with most of the traditional choices of rice and meat. Halal Chicken, lamb and beef. Limited veggie options.  I came here for take out and for $13, got a hefty container of rice, 2 beef Kabab strips, salad and yogurt sauce.   What you should try, coming here: Bouglanee - think quesadilla but softer pan fried bread stuffed with potatoes, spring onions and herbs.   Kofta Kabab - 2 skewers of ground beef . The meat is perfectly tender and the spices are JUST right. I cannot explain how hard it is to find the just right mix for the perfect Kabab. This place, they definitely nailed it.   Sultani Kabab - the 2 different types of Kabab - this is heaven for meat lovers. 1 skewer of a rougher type of Kabab (think - steak) and 1 skewer of a tender beef Kabab.  Qaubolee rice - Traditional Afghan rice. Cooked with chicken broth. Made with thin carrot shreds, raisins and almonds (sometimes cashews).  - Delicious.  *fun fact: This type of rice is made specifically for meat.  *The white rice is made for chicken.   Tip: call ahead of time and order. Since this is the only decent Afghan restaurant around Mississauga, you'll see mostly Afghan,persian,pakistani  families.  Be prepared , you will have kids running around, uncles, fathers, cousins, nephews, aunts, brothers in law- all socializing whilst waiting in line for food.  You are pretty much witnessing a family gathering.  It's a small space so the tables are all cramped together. I highly suggest take out. The staff are pretty monotone - which is always amusing. Service is next to nil ch here. Don't bother expecting it. Expect what it does offer, authentic Afghan food and nothing else.   xoxox M."}
{"text":"Great food! Their bolani is sooooo good! Definitely one of my fav afghan restaurants! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Delicious each time I eat here and consistent. I recommend the chicken kebab plate"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Afghan food and this restaurant is an unexpected discovery and pleasant surprise for me. A friend took me there for an early dinner and the first thing that hits you is the friendly atmosphere. Both the staff and customers are friendly and there are lots of families enjoying as well.  The seating is tight and busy but I didn't mind that.  it's sort of like a fast-food-style restaurant that serves fresh fine food.  The place was busy for a Saturday at 6:00 pm but It just shows how popular this place is. All this combined with amazing freshly made food. My chicken kebab was cooked to perfection with a lovely mixture of spices and it was succulent and tender.  Served on a bed of spiced rice with salad, fresh tomato salsa-style sauce and flatbread. A very satisfying meal and experience. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 sultani dinners for about $33 and it fed my family of 4. We got naan, meat, rice, salad, and tomato salad. The serving is huge and it got all of us full just by splitting 2 plates."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Meat was tender and tasty. Large portions and clean restaurant. Staff helpful in choosing what to order."}
{"text":"Bamiyan was one of the first famous Afgan place in Mississauga as far as I can remember and not there are a lot of similar cuisine restaurant such as Watan Kabab and Khandhar Kabab.   I love the any of their kababs and they are spiced well and cooked to perfection. The is left tender inside and you enjoy it with rice or they nice soft naan bread. You can also get their Kabuli rice which are is topped with fried sliced carrots and raisins. i also love there 2 sauces (white and red).  The meals are great for the price you would pay, as you always will have to take some home, the portions are big.   The only this I don't like about this restaurant is there aren't a far bit amount of tables for people to sit, it gets cramped on the weekends and its hard to get seating if you are with family. some times there are people lined up beside you while you eat and that is a big downer for me. I have been told their Brampton location is much bigger than this on. I have stopped going to Bamiyan as you can get similar food with seating in various Afgan restaurants in area.  It's part of a plaza so there is plenty of parking available.  For my Muslim Brother and Sister - They serve halal meat"}
{"text":"Oh it was gooooood! Had the beef kebab platter with their delicious beef tikka and the beef skewer on a bed of rice and naan bread.  The meat itself was just too delicate in flavor, Tikkas perfectly cooked, nice heat and the best succulent amounts of fat on it...mouth watering!!  Moreover, the rice itself were so tasty, the flavor is still in my mouth two hours later!  For drinks, I'd say the mango smoothie was too sweet for me, the yogurt drink may have been much better. I'll recommend to try that one. And the portion is huge! So not for the faint hearted for sure"}
{"text":"Honestly I don't see the hype about this place. Yes the food is good but so is other kebab places. Watan kebab is exactly the same, so is Afghan kebab and so is Chapli kebab."}
{"text":"I am and have always been a Bamiyan fan. Their kebabs are spiced and grilled perfectly, the rice is flavourful, the naan is also on point. The portions are generous. What's not to love about them? They certainly are not a fine dine, they are always busy with other patrons waiting for you stuff everything in your face and get the hell out.  So you can't sit there and enjoy the meal, certainly not on weekends.  If you don't want to rush, order a takeout and drive home to eat in a more relaxed environment. Also, there is nothing for vegetarians. Obviously, it's a kebab place so it's unfair to expect a lot but having at least a couple of vegetarian dishes would strengthen my case or save me some time. Wifey being vegetarian doesn't wants to go there at all, but sometimes relents because I love coming here. So she waits for me then we go to another restaurant of her liking.   Despite all this, they are my go-to restaurant to satisfy protein cravings."}
{"text":"This is my families ultimate go-to place. My siblings always order the tandoori chicken but I get the Barg kabob each time.  The rice is as fresh as it gets and flavourful. The servings are huge. Reasonable priced and a decent dining atmosphere. I always recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Yes, this place is good. For the average consumer, everything lines up. Great tasting chapli and beef kabobs with rice and salad.   HOWEVER, having had the best Chapli kabob ever at de Afghanan in Fremont, CA, I cannot give this place higher than a 4 knowing the very best is out there. I know, I know, food snobbery.  Whether you have or haven't been to de Afghanan you will still find the food here to be satisfying and all around yummy.   Definitely try the phirnee and the mango drink."}
{"text":"I always get the sultani kabob and bergh kabob. However also try the chapli kabobs as well as the tandoori chicken...they're amazing! And it comes with rice and bread (I dunno if its naan or what but it is simply divine... soft...warm, delicious). If you're in the Mississauga area, this is a must try. However I gotta warn you to try and stop by during weekdays around noonish or so because the place is packed on weekends and it is really hard to find a table. Again that just shows how great the food is which is why the place is always so packed! We also had this catered for some wedding guests during a house party. And they loved it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. The Sultani Kebob and Half Chicken are consistently very good. Service and times not the most crisp. Go for the food."}
{"text":"Best food in the town. While moving in the restaurant, the first I notice during the meal is rice. The quality of rice might be the best one I tried in the afghani grills. Decent ambience. Good with kids"}
{"text":"- bamiyan kabab.... YOU WIN! - this place is legit. - and you know it's legit, when it's always packed, and whole scores of families roll-up in their minivans. - anything and everything is fantastic.  - only downside is finding a table...."}
{"text":"Ate: Lamb kabab with salad and naan.  Drank: Water  Liked: The naan was awesome, is it fried in oil?  Disliked: They don't take credit cards... boo  Chicken: Yes!  Would mom like it?:   Would I go back: Next time I'm in TO.  Recommend: Make your own combo by adding on a skewer."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Ordered a Tandoori Chicken Special Dinner Kabob and a Veggie Wrap for dine in, and the cashier gave us the wrong order. When we picked up our order, we confirmed that it was the right order number, and the man behind the counter said it was the right order. We got the Veggie Wrap, however we got a Greek salad instead of the Tandoori Chicken Dinner, and didn't realize until a few bites in. Upon realizing, we walked up to the counter and told them the issue only to be treated rudely, and blamed for getting the wrong order. After suggesting we get a refund for the Chicken Tandoori Dinner, the manager wanted to charge us for both the Chicken Tandoori Dinner and the Greek Salad, although we didn't get the Tandoori Dinner. He wasn't trying to listen to us, so we just left. Point is, no one was trying to resolve the issue and were just trying to overcharge us."}
{"text":"I joked that there were 6 kebab places within half-a-mile and my colleagues took that to mean I was intent on having a kebab. As we discussed it, another colleague highly recommended Bamiyan, so we took her advice and she was right. I got the tikka kebab skewer and the kofta wrap. Both were great! The naan was warm and tasty. I will definitely return, if I get back to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Solid place to get a good amount of quality afghani food, specifically kabob and bread.  We went late night and the place was extremely busy, however, service was good nonetheless."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite place until they barely put any salad on my plate!!  Over priced !   The girls working there don't care about anything but talking to each other! Why don't you exchange numbers and chat over the phone! After shift !! Very unprofessional ! I've brought a lot of friends here and last time I came was delt in a very rude manner! Standing infront talking, why don't u just hire less people?  Rolling eyes is there profession ! Etc but if ur afghani u get smiles and 6 star treatment! ! Unacceptable !   not happy!never coming back!"}
{"text":"Come here every time I am in the area and love there wraps.  I usually get the chicken breast wrap or tandoori chicken. Everything is cooked fresh and authentic. It is a casual contemporary Afghan restaurant with great service and the food had so much flavor.  Lots to like here and something I can only get a few times a year when I travel, so I look forward to it.  A few locations around Toronto area."}
{"text":"I had takeout at Bamiyan Kabob recently.  I was really surprised that this place was so crowded on a weeknight.  Pretty much all the tables were full and there was a constant line up to order.  I was the only non-Middle-Eastern person in the restaurant.  I thought that this was a good sign that the food would be excellent, but alas I was wrong.  I had the Sultani Dinner ($13.49), which had 1 beef kabob and 1 ground red meat kabob (probably ground beef, it could have had lamb in it, I'm not sure, sorry).  The dinner also came with rice, salad and naan.    The meat was not all that great.  The beef kabob was tough and chewy.  The ground meat kabob tasted like cardboard.  I was so disappointed.  The salad was iceberg lettuce, onions and diced tomatoes.  It was fresh and the vinaigrette was good.  The naan was a good size and really fresh and soft.  I like that they didn't sprinkle any sesame seeds on it like they do at Watan Kabob because I can't eat sesame seeds.  The rice was not too mushy nor too dry.  The dinner came with a creamy white sauce and a red sauce.  The white sauce was too sour for my liking and the red sauce was reminiscent of a runny salsa.    The meat at Watan Kabob is much better than at Bamiyan in my opinion.  The other stuff (salad, rice and naan) are comparable.    I have to say though that the service was excellent.  Despite it being super busy the staff were very attentive.  A nice lady staff member noticed that I was waiting a long time for my order (several numbers higher than mine were being called).  She came over and asked me what my order number was and asked the kitchen about it.  Shortly after my order came out.  I'm pretty sure that I was hard not to notice as I stuck out like a sore thumb (being the only non-Middle Eastern person in the restaurant and all), but still, I really appreciated that she followed up with me and ensured that my order was coming.      This place was super busy and crowded and loud.  I would not want to eat here for that reason.  I'm glad I had takeout.    I noticed that all kitchen staff had one gloved hand and one un-gloved hand.  I'm hoping they use the gloved hand when handling customers' food.    Decor is \"typical shawarma joint\" kind of decor.  There is lots of free parking in the parking lot as the restaurant is in a strip mall.  Overall, service was excellent, food not so excellent.  Sorry."}
{"text":"I work in the area, and Bamiyan is a staple in my lunch rotation. It never fails to offer a good meal.  If you've never had Afghani food, I'd compare it too... greek food with added spices. You have different kabobs (or kabAbs as their name implies) and meats of different variety and spices grilled on skewers (mostly).  Add some rice, some garden salad, and you have a middle eastern version of Greek food.   Anyway, the food is good. Some may find it spicy, but most people I've brought here have really enjoyed it. The dishes are prepared when you order, or close to it, so it can be a 10-15 minute wait for your food.  Nearly all the meat dishes I've had are good here, here's a few: Kofta: some mixture of beef, garlic and other spices.  It's garlic heavy, so bring some tic-tacs or a tooth brush if you're going back to work. It's the cheapest item, but it'll still fill you up and it's good.  Comes with two skewers. Chaplee: think of two big burger patties with chilli spices in them. You'll get stuffed. May be a bit hot for some. Sultani: the king of the dishes, the most expensive, it comes with a skewer of beef tenderloin or filet mignon (forget which, but it's delicious), and a kofta skewer Tandoori: Tandoori chicken is flavourful, but sometimes a bit dry.  Comes with one skewer. Chicken: chicken breast  with some spices. My least favorite, as the chicken isn't overly spiced and can be dry at times.  On average, it'll cost you about $10 for a plate without rice, and $13 for a plate with rice, depending on the meat you get of course.  Pro: simple, the food is really good  Cons: a bit pricey for the dinners here, it can be a long wait at lunch since they make the dish when you order, not a huge fan on the naan bread they give you here. It's Afghan type naan, I prefer the Indian naan. This naan, though fresh, is tougher and harder than Indian naan.  Tip: If you're having lunch, I'd suggest getting the kabob plate without rice. It's a few dollars cheaper and the dinner plate with rice will likely put you to sleep at work... it's HEAVY.   The rice though is delicious, so if you go with a group I'd suggest getting individual plates without rice, then ordering a side plate of rice. They give you plenty of rice and it's cheaper this way.  And you can portion it so you don't need an afternoon nap!"}
{"text":"First time to an Afghani resto.  The place is ridiculously busy on a Sunday night at 8 PM.  We snagged the last four top.  You have to order from the counter and they eventually call your name number so you can pick up your food. The menu is a variety of kebabs served as dinners which means it comes with rice and salad or just with rice.  Afghani pita is an oblong, crispy fluffy pillowy goodness.  The lamb was a bit dry but the beef kebabs and the chicken kebabs were moist and delicious.  It seems to be a popular place for families to dine.  Great food and reasonable prices.   Worth a trip back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is always soooo good.  I've tried Tikka, Tandoori and Kofta kabob, boulagnee and their mango drink.  I love how fresh everything tastes and how tender their meats are. What I also love is their location because this is literally 10 minutes away from my home.   The only thing I'll complain about is their service. It's a little bit slow... I wish they were a bit quicker because there are days when I'm waiting about 20 minutes to get my food."}
{"text":"Very good food. The service is also very good.  Try the bolani.  Busy at times so have to wait a bit for seating.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  Been heron multiple occasions.  Id give this place a 5 star if the customer service was better.  I usually get the chicken kabob with rice and the flatbread. The meat is tender and juicy."}
{"text":"Only reason they got 4 and not 5 stars was that they don't accept credit cards. The people behind the counter are really nice, friendly and helpful. The food was fantastic! We got the tandoori chicken and the meat was tender and juicy and the spices were really good.  Great flavor!  Great mango smoothies.  The bread was really good.  Overall - some of the best Afghani food I've ever had.  Very new, clean and well kept. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My rating has gone down due to the Long wait and quite costly meal.   You can get a wrap for about $5.29, but for $11.30 you can get 2 kebobs and rice and salad and naan. It's a lot of food, but finishable. I found it a bit pricey.  Also I waited a long time to get my meat. I got the Choppan Lamb, but they didn't tell me it will take longer (ten minutes longer!) It did taste really good tho.   Still, i suggest getting there early at 11:40 before the line starts. Tons of seating which is good."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a former coworker a few months ago.  Since the beginning of 2015, I've had a resolution to eat a lot healthier and more ethically as well, which involves eating less meat, fish and dairy and when I do eat it, to try and make sure it was treated in a \"humane\" way (let's face it, killing is never humane).  However, when meeting with coworkers, you sometimes have very little choice unless you want them to question everything your eating.    So I gave it and ordered one of their kabob dinners.  I found everything fresh and the rice was perfectly seasoned.  As for the meat, I found it worse than Pamier and Watan because it felt more starchy.    With regards to service, it's sort of self-serve and you just pick it up when it's ready, so I have no complaints there.  Verdict: It's not bad, but it's also a bit noisy too.  If I were to eat Afghan foods, I'd still much prefer the Pamier up north in Brampton."}
{"text":"love their food. been going for some time after a family member told me about it. close to industrial area and in a plaza full of other Halal restaurants. but this is the most busiest place. people have to fight to get a table.  i give food a 3 star rating and but staff is extremely rude and prejudice (for whatever reason). washrooms are dirty, they do not come clean the tables right after people leave so customers have to wipe down other's left over rice and bread crumbs. i always have to come ask the cashier to send someone over for a quick wipe down (then someone shows up after waiting a few minutes).  tried pretty much everything on their menu, the WORST items are the wraps. i had Chicken Breast Kabob once and literally had to throw in the garbage in front of them after my first bite (like they even care...).  i hate to go places where they do not accept a Credit card"}
{"text":"Folks if you like properly cooked meat with absolutely no disappointment than look no further .. THIS IS IT!!! .. Order the Sultani Kabob dinner and don't forget to ask for the white sauce"}
{"text":"Great service!! big place, but always crowded.  it's a order and eat casual dining experience.  Prices are about the same as other Bamiyan in Scarbrough.  about $150 for 8-9 dinner orders.  Their fridge with soda and water, is very confusing, it's open to public, if your server doesn't ask you about drinks, you would think it's free.  my kids just grabbed and started drinking, I didn't even notice the fridge since I was placing the order, but its like grab n go.  I asked my server if the soda is free and she said no you tell me how many you want and I charge you.  Someone can easily pay for 2 and grab 4.  and due to this reason food prices go up."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken korma it was killer really flavourful and delicious.  Massive portion as well.   Top quality! The wait was horrendous though like 20mins not sure why   otherwise impressed."}
{"text":"The food here was good and I may be back someday but it was definitely not as memorable as watan kabob or Kandahar kebab. It seemed as though the service was fast in terms of ordering but I did take some time to get your food and everybody was fighting over tables so that was a little disappointing. I think I would be back but I felt as if the prices were a bit higher and there were no combos such as the ones I was used to and other places I think the food was good but definitely not so great where it's super memorable that would draw me back"}
{"text":"I am a white woman who does not wear a hijab. Needless to say, I felt a bit discriminated against being here. I figured this restaurant would pay me no mind since I had a simple to-go order of the kofta dinner plate. The girl at the counter was curt and condescending when I was choosing from the menu. She talked to me like I was a child, and rolled her eyes when I tried to pay with my credit card--they only take cash--bummer. I gave her US$12 for my order of CAD$11.27 (I didn't have Canadian currency), and gave me 0.73 cents in Canadian currency--she completely ignored my request to calculate a simple exchange rate and give me the correct amount back in Canadian! Fine. She acted very impatient with me, but with all the middle eastern men behind me, she took their order without a hint of attitude. Mind you, half the tables were empty (2:30pm), so it wasn't extremely busy.  Now, for the food. I figured it would be their redeeming quality to overcome my already repugnant experience with the cashier. However, I was severely disappointed. The meat was the best part, and that's not saying much! It tasted gamey--how can you possibly do that with beef??? The salad (if you want to call it that) was measly, wilted and tasteless. The rice was overcooked (mushy) and oily/slimy, not fluffy like it should be! Two sauces come with this meal: a white and a red. The white one should be garlic sauce, right? Wrong! It was RANCH DRESSING! And not even the good kind, but the store-bought, possibly expired, fat-free kind! The red one was... SALSA?! Once again, not even the good kind! I'm from Texas--I know good salsa! This ain't it! What they gave me was a watery mash of red \"things\" that look like salsa. So are they trying to con this white girl or are they just plain culturally confused???  I'm married to a man of middle eastern descent, have been immersed quite a bit in this culture, and know what good food is--this surely is NOT. I would also think being located near such a large metroplex like Toronto, they would be used to the intermingling of different peoples and give mutual respect, if not just some basic customer service evenly across the board. In the end though, the food was even worse than the cashier's attitude toward me. You're safe if you are middle eastern and have low standards for Arabic food."}
{"text":"First off the space is cramped and absolutely hate that. They can't not make any complex Afghan food right the only thing they can make right is salad and bread. And by the way the lamb has no meat on it."}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on Afghan food, but I figured if the place is full and I'm the only obvious person not of middle eastern descent then it's probably pretty good. I ordered the Sultani Kabob and enjoyed it very much. I'd happily go back for more next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY.  Came here on the recommendation of my customer for dinner but had to leave as they do not accept Credit Cards.  Hence the 1 star.  Too bad.  The place smelled awesome"}
{"text":"Really good halal place. You know what you are getting for your money. Good food and good sides.  The wait is a bit long but it worth it.  I recommend you calling in to pre order :-) Good service! I will go again for sure.  Loved their food. Specially the tandoori chicken platter."}
{"text":"Afghani fast food. I was here around noon today for lunch with a friend, there were a couple people ahead of us but the place got pretty busy by 1pm.  I had the Chicken Breast Kabob with salad/naan which I would definitely recommend. The chicken breast was super juicy, and the spicy red sauce was tasty. Naan and white sauce were average."}
{"text":"Bad customer service ! server/order taker was donna ~ extremely rude and very disrespectful. they don't give the sauce even if you eat at the restaurant. My salad had no dressing when I asked for a little dressing on the salad Donna got extremely angry. She was very unprofessional. I spend $100 + went with a few people and I was extremely disappointed with my experience. I think in the past 2 years or so the management seems to have changed and the level of customer service and ambience has greatly declined. very very disappointed ! I can not comment on the food as it was bbq and dry and she was relentless ~ hide the salad dressing and sauce was the strategy for the day!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto and heard great reviews of this place so decided to visit. After going thru the menu selection, when it was time to pay, the guy at the cash register tells me that they don't take visa, master or American Express and only take a debit card or cash and if I paid in US dollars it would be the same price as Canadian dollars!! The place is rip off and very surprised that they don't take any cards. I had to walk away."}
{"text":"One of the few places my entire family agrees on! Delicious meat, very flavourful rice, and a decent salad make for a great dinner plate. It's sometimes very loud inside with families + screaming kids, so we usually get takeout. I will say that when they first opened they were *perfect*, but since they've gotten much more popular and raised their prices, the quality of the meat and its preparation quality has gone down slightly (particularly the Barg Kabob, which used to be incredible and grilled just right, but is now occasionally chewy, tougher, and mildly over-grilled.) I'd be happy to pay the raised prices if the quality stayed the same, but it dipped. However, with that caveat, they're still awesome, and my parents -- who really hate going out to eat -- eagerly agree to Bamiyan."}
{"text":"Average food ordered lamb shank kebabs n chapli kebab , presentation was good , taste was better for Chapli kebab but lamb shanks were dry n rubbery. Naan was dry n they did t have butter to moisten it . Average place , nothing to look back on."}
{"text":"Terrible service. You'll wait twice as long as any other Bamiyan kabob bcs they're serving friends and call-ins before customers who're standing in line with a number"}
{"text":"Food wasn't too bad (got the kafta)...menu pricing was all blacked out so you do not see prices (was told they were updating the menu). Nothing great considering all the other restaurants in the area...big downside is they do not accept credit cards."}
{"text":"The ordering process was painful. The chicken was good, it had a little kick to it. The beef was dry and mediocre at best. Suggest getting chicken kabob when you go there."}
{"text":"Great Afghan kabob here. There might be better places around but this is probably the best in Mississauga. A little smaller then the one in Malton. I go to both locations frequently."}
{"text":"Very good food reasonable prices, hard to get tables, tables are not clean, floors are dirty, staff behind the counter was bit rude.  However food is really good."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday. It's a fairly busy fast food place.  Healthy options, particularly for lunch where you can get some grilled meat with a large salad and some Afghani bread. Everything was very good, especially the dough (yogurt drink with mint).  It would be nice if they had some yoghurt or something to eat the bread with though... We were dipping it in ranch dressing!"}
{"text":"Honestly speaking, the people who i usually see who eats at this place , they are mostly pakistani ,therefore , they dont know anything about afghani Food. Having some spices mixed and called it afgani food , not so afgani. I guess people just dont seem to know what the real authentic taste is or maybe they dont seem to care becuase they are blinfolded by overwhelming crowd."}
{"text":"Worst Bamiyan location IMO, always too crowded and too many people breathing down your neck.  Tables are always filthy from the people sitting there before you, because you have to pounce on the table before someone else does, leaving you to clean it yourself.  Food is good as I'm a fan of all the Bamiyan locations but I give this one only 3 stars due to the service."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chopan with naan. 3 stars to the food. The meat is on the salty side and I can't really taste too much of the lamb or other flavor.  Naan was great.  One more star to the cashier who was nice and smily :)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Saturday...Ordered the lamb chop dinner meal and a mango smoothie.  The lamb chops were grilled very nicely so that they were nice and tender amd well seasoned.  The rice was flavoured and nice and fluffy.  The salad was...well, salad!   The mango smoothie was very nice and refreshing....all in all a very good meal.. Went into a bit of a food coma afterwards from being so full.  Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Want a lap dance and some Afghan food? This place is hands down my favorite spot in Mississauga, but folks get a little \"frisky,\" waiting for you to get up so they can sit down with their kofta. You might even get a lap dance if you take too long at your seat. Eat and get out, or stay for the \"show.\" Seriously, this food is AMAZING. TRULY. Do not accept substitutions from other nearby spots. This is the real deal."}
{"text":"Very good experience. I came in for takeout and the food came quick despite a very full restaurant. Prices were on par with other middle eastern/central Asian restaurants in the area.   Atmosphere was bright and the restaurant was full of middle eastern and central Asian clientele - that really says a lot for me about authenticity.   Portions were very generous. The meat was incredibly flavorful and their rice was some of the best I've ever had for this type of cuisine.   Only issue for me as a traveling American that didn't have a lot of CADs on me is that they don't take credit cards and they won't accept foreign debit cards. They offered to convert some of my USD but their currency conversion caused me to lose 1 USD.   Still very satisfied with my experience!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat food away from home. Afghan food is simple but yet delicious. Maybe because I love grilled meat, but it might be the sauces you get on the side. Try it yourself :)"}
{"text":"Always busy, but its worth waiting! Amazingly delicious dishes...if you have a group of 4 -6, order following dishes and share. Remember, their portions are HUGE; I usually finish my dish, but my wife and kids can't :-)  Barg Kabob Chapli Kabob Sultani Kabob Kafta Kabab and  Tikka Kabob.  If you have a taste for lamb, then order Chopan Kabob.  Please be prepared to WAIT, this place gets really crowded, I would wait for an hour to get this food........its worth it :-)"}
{"text":"Would have given 5 star if we had got table early enough and if someone cared to give us a high chair.  Food was good, if I go again would pick a less crowded time or would take out. I am from NJ not sure if I'd come back to missigua.:)"}
{"text":"A lebanese restaurant owner told me this is where he stops for food when he's in Toronto for afghani food. The location is in strip mall that's easy to drive by.    But wow... This place is a gem!    Don't let the humble surroundings or pricing fool you...My stylish downtown foodie friends devoured the dishes and I can't  wait to go back.  The staff was great to explain the dishes for me.  The pricing was amazing.  I picked up a full dinner for 3 adults for only $35.  And all of us had 2nd helpings.  The meat was flavourful...definitely get the half chicken...glorious . They say its spicy but its heat is fine for most. The salad is a bit soggy and gross. But it comes automatically with the combos.  The atmosphere is lacking in decor so maybe better to get take out if you're picking on your surroundings.  however the groups of interesting people...all ages and walks of life... Makes up for it.  You feel like you've discovered a secret place in a far off land.  Definitely plan to wait for your order...20 min minimum. If you're doing takeout ,call ahead."}
{"text":"Never disappointed with the food.  Excellent tandori chicken!"}
{"text":"The spices were just right with my lamb set. However the restaurant doesn't accept credit cards which was a bit annoying. The portion was really big so I was very full. Lamb came with rice, salad and naan bread which was huge."}
{"text":"The quality of food has gone downhill since I last visited (probably mid-2012). The dough (buttermilk-type drink) was SO bad this time. Plus, since this is a popular place for families, there are always hoards of devil children screaming and crying. Add those screams to the constant din of chairs screeching against the floor as they're being dragged, and you've got an orchestra of the most annoying sounds possible.  Overall: Decent food, crappy dough, annoying/loud/awful atmosphere"}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall. They do not accept credit cards. So bring cash. They have a lot of seating. Some picture on the walls- nice to look at. Portion sizes are large. The afghan bread was amazing! The sauces that you get with your dish are good.. the chutney is a little spicy and the white sauce is good! We all got a dish and split everything so we could try a little bit of everything. It was al ldelicious. The Montu was pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"I have had Sultani Kabab in different places and by far this is the #BEST# place taste wise.  Their Mantu is also amazing."}
{"text":"i would give them a 3.8 stars overall. I have been to this location for countless time. However, I do figured out they can not keep their food quality consistent. Sometimes the kebab is over cooked or taste bland and on some other day if you are lucky, their foods surprise you.   Well, I don't want to left a solid 4 stars here and disappointed my potential viewers.  So it is just a heads up for anyone who intends to visit this place."}
{"text":"Love the chapley kabob dinner. Great food but horrible service! We ordered our food and paid and the guy forgot to send the ticket to the kitchen to tell them the order. Half hour later the other girl asks us our order and realizes the order was never submitted! Order took about an hour and this was in Ramadan close to opening the fast! We opened our fast in the car going back home!"}
{"text":"Delicious! This is the first time to try Afghan food. It took a long time to get all food I ordered. They screwed up my order twice.  Price: Most plates are around $10.   Atmosphere: Like a fast food restaurant. Many families.   Food: Most plates have meat. Veggie wrap for vegetarians. Only one dessert is a rice pudding. They have a unique drink like non sweet  lassie with dry tea leaves on top. The name is DOUGH! Nan is tougher than Indian ones. Lam Ian's the long rice are delicious!!  Staffs: They are nice.  Attention: No credit card! OMG! I had CAN$20 by chance. Whew.  Location: This area is really international. Chinese, Thai, Japanese,... Many exotic restaurants."}
{"text":"You know what?  Food-wise, I actually find all these kabob places interchangeable.  What makes a difference are location, service, & atmosphere.  That's it!  After not visiting Bamiyan in a coupla years - it's not in my 'hood, I came here for a takeout.  Takeout takes AT LEAST 10-15 minutes and they appeared very disorganised.  So as per the other reviewers, food is slooow to roll out - BOTH dine-in and take-out.  Plus it ain't that cheap either!  I ordered a Tikka Kabob (beef tenderloin) with Salad & Naan and that was $8.99, before taxes.  I didn't find the serving size all that big.  In fact, I was able to eat the entire order for dinner!  (With Watan, I cannot finish their dinner.  And I find their chunks of meat are larger.  I can spread out 1 order for 2-3 meals.)  Tomatoes on my salad were green/barely red and crunchy.  :p  Tasted fine, but they weren't ripe at all.  Although I didn't dine in, atmosphere was meh.  Workers didn't look all that happy.  I prefer the happier groups at Watan much better.  Really didn't make a great impression on this return visit!"}
{"text":"I've gone to Bamiyan a few times for lunch and while the food is alright, I've always been unimpressed with everything else.  Food: I recommend the Chicken (Tandoori optional) Wrap.  The dinner plates are $12+ and come with half the place covered in rice. I definitely recommend asking for an extra hot sauce (switching your white one for another hot one).  Service: Bamiyan's popularity also contributes to their poor wait times. I've had to wait 15-25 minutes to get food because of how busy they are."}
{"text":"Good quality. Always busy. Everything on the menu is actually good which is a rarity. Decent prices, excellent portions for the price. I recommend the chaplee kabob dinner and the kafta kebob wrap. The tandoori dinner pretty good too. Expect a 5-10 minute wait for your order. Staff is good, efficient and friendly. Would definitely recommend for lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic afghani cuisine , very quick and very very clean ... Savoured every single bite but again no facility for credit card :(!! For a  fast food id go there anytime ! The seasoning the meat the chicken, all grilled with allot of love and care :)!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a quick healthy meal of grilled Afghan kabob however be careful as it gets very busy on Saturdays and Sundays. Also not much options If you are vegetarian."}
{"text":"Great food... This place gets really busy at some points in the day, but I would say the food is worth the wait. I suggest the chicken tandoori, or the tikka kebab ."}
{"text":"Food is good! Seasoned well and cooked the way it should be. Service is good too (whether dine in or take out). Sometimes too crowded. Interior is simplistic - reminds me of one of the countless food courts in a mall."}
{"text":"Always order kabab from these guys, always delicious. Haven't eaten inside the restaurant  but don't think i could anyway since its always packed! They haven't disappointed yet and I don't think they will, if you need kabab this is the place."}
{"text":"Quality food with generous amount for a good price. I've never regret coming here with my co workers during lunch. Any of the chicken, beef, salmon tandoori plates are delicious."}
{"text":"I don't mind being the odd person out in here.  I came here to eat some Afghan food and Afghan food is what I'm gonna get...plus curious looks from fellow diners across and around my table (well, I'm curious too!)   The kabobs are delicious!  And there's so much rice to help fill you up!  And for a late night food trip, put this up on your list.  The kabobs are cooked fresh off the grill.  And the crowd definitely tells you that the place is worth a visit!"}
{"text":"A couple of years ago, we had a team lunch here. There were about eight of us.   I am used to going to the Bamiyan location on Airport Road, which has plenty of seats and isn't excessively noisy. This location is closer to our office.   The seating area was limited at noon. It was loud, and we ended up shouting at one another across the table to try and hear ourselves. It was ugly! We also couldn't sit together as a group. In short, it felt like being at a food court.   The food was delicious, as expected. I ordered the chicken tikka with salad and pita bread. Everything was fresh.   I would come here to do takeout. If I had to dine here, I'd try to come during off-peak hours.   (38)"}
{"text":"I had the chicken breast kabob dinner. The chicken was moist, and the portions are huge. I love the firnee, there is no way Im not getting it at every visit."}
{"text":"I decided to check out Bamiyan Kabob for a tasty Friday lunch. Entering the restaurant, you can tell the place is popular. Although it is very large and offers quite a good amount of seating only 1 table was free which meant my meal was going to be a to-go.   The menu on the board didn't provide the description of the kabob's available so I had to use the paper menu. I ended up settling on the Sultani Kabob dinner which included a mix of Barg kabob (filet mignon chunks) and Kofta kabob (lean ground beef skewer) as well as rice, salad, and naan.  Had to wait for about 15 or so minutes for my order to come through but you can tell the food was fresh when it was put in my bag. I have to say the kabob itself was delicious. The meat was juicy and full of flavour. The rice was fresh and went amazingly well with the kabob. The naan felt like it was fresh out of the oven. The salad could have been a little better but was nice to make my meal not feel too unhealthy. I would make sure to ask for more hot sauce and dressing than the one of each they give you.   Overall, my experience at Bamiyan Kabob was great and will definitely be stopping by for some grub in the future!"}
{"text":"Crazy busy restaurant. Food is decent. The lamb chops could be a bit bigger and meatier but they were seasoned well. The chicken kabob sandwich was good, especially their sauce."}
{"text":"I have never been to this place before (my wife has) great food. Had the mix of fillet minot kebab and kofta with rice naan and salad. Honeslty i would go again anytime, the atmosphere was great, clean, full of families. The wait was about 15 mins but it was packed and everything was good to order..  GREAT STUFF!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered Kofta kebab and Chaplee kabob. Amazing kebabs, and they're very traditional.  Clean food, healthy, scrumptious and large portions.  Their naan bread is amazing!  It's very busy and crowded, so expect a long wait. But trust me, it's worth the wait ;)"}
{"text":"The place was packed with people and had wonderful reviews on Yelp. I like Afghan food and a fan of Kabul express in Chicago so when I went there I was expecting a culinary delight but was not good. The rice was not seasoned properly. The kefta kabob was bland and the barg was nearly burnt. Overall, I wasted money and time."}
{"text":"This place was packed when we arrived and it was tough for us to spot a seat. The food was delicious. The bread was fresh baked and the kebabs were fresh except the rice. The mango smoothie was really awesome..."}
{"text":"These Afghanis know how to put it down in the kitchen! Amazing food and the price is pretty damn reasonable. Its great food for the money spent and definitely fills u up. Dont forget to ask for the WHITE SAUCE if u takeaway or sit-in. I generally order beforehand and pick it up. Theres lotsa room to sit in and eat too. Ive had the Chapli Dinner which is AMAZING. Also the BULANI is pretty damn good. Dessert FIRNI is yum yum too. Oh and they have this mango smoothy....that'll just make u go...\"DAMN THATS SOME GOOD SMOOTHY!!!\" Recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Here's a review! They charge extra 50 cents for there white sauce and make you stand in line again to buy it! Are you kidding me??? The prices have almost doubled in the past few years and your gonna charge me for a stupid sauce! The quality and customer service was good when they opened but had gotten bad over the years I guess all that money is making them greedy!! No more am I going there! Tons of afghan places out there taste better anyway!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the tandoori chicken dinner. It was definitely delicious. Portion sizes could be different, maybe less rice and a bit more chicken like the other meals (unless they ordered a second set). Could just be the culture but there was alot of rice. Rice was good though. My only real complaint was the (female) bathroom. Let's just say I don't like standing in pee while I hover over more pee on the seat and God knows what else while do my business. Again that could have been the customers not caring, however, since there was no toilet paper I assume they hadn't checked the washrooms since they opened, at LEAST. Other than that, the food was good and I'd definitely go back if I was a local."}
{"text":"Awesome food i get the chapli kabab dinner every time I go, its a guranteed good meal everytime. I like the consistancy of taste and the casual dining environment is family friendly on most occassions. I would suggest order the chapli kabab dinner if you are going for the first time. Customer service is decent, nothing to praise except they do freely give out as many containers of their white garlic sauce for free, atleast to me. Ive heard some locations now charge for extra sauce."}
{"text":"My hubby ordered some lamb grill on a Saturday evening..first time..and he said it was yummy but sweet mother of Abraham Lincoln!! For that long waiting time I could have slaughtered and cooked the lamb myself! The food must be great judging by how busy they are but still..35-45min wait for one item? Wonder if they take phone orders for pick up.."}
{"text":"This such a family friendly restaurant, it has a great layout and great for bringing friends and family. It does feel like a cafeteria but the food is delicious and the portion sizes are very big. You will definitely have leftovers to bring home! The naan was a bit different from the soft sought goodness that I am accustomed to.  They have a number of dishes but everything comes with salad. The salad is surprisingly fresh and the tomato was spectacular! In fact, the tomato salad was my favourite part of the meal!   This was definitely a win and we would be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a recent trip and decided to try another location, ummmmmm ummmm ummm so good wish they had one in California.  I ordered one skewer of chicken and one skewer of the ground beef both were very flavorful and cooked to perfection.  The warm bread was a hit and do they sell their salad dressing?"}
{"text":"Wow - I was blown away at the tandori kebabs.  The food was amazing - fresh, and great quality.  The only thing was that there was absolutely zero ambiance.  Some music would have been nice.  But great food overall and will definitely be back!"}
