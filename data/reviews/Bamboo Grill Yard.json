{"text":"They do have authentic dishes here but they are just not executed right, lack of flavor or just salty. I was born in Shenzhen, lived there for 15 years so I have had all type of \"authentic\" chinese food and this place is not good at all.   I would recommend going to a few other places in the valley, Original Cuisine which is from Cali opened up a few months ago on Broadway and like Dobson, Chou's kitchen and Chengdu delight just to name a few.   I gave this place a try twice, which I regret after the first visit. I really wanted to like this place since it was a 5 minute drive from my place."}
{"text":"This is a very good place for authentic Chinese food. I have eaten there many times and I have never been disappointed. This is a small business and we need to support them and give them the help they need to grow. Thank you for reading this"}
{"text":"I hate to do it but this place had some terrible \"authentic\" Chinese food.   I was so happy when unnoticed they had Szechuan style foods here so I thought let's try them out. We spent almost $80 bucks so we can try a bunch of things but once I realized what we got the dishes were already over priced. We are not the type to look at Costco when we order so this way we can get what we like but hen looking at cost for each dish it was higher than most of the other places we go and the flavor was no there.   The Fuqi feipian (husband and wife) cold dish was not flavorful at all. It only had thick, hard beef pieces with no tendon or tripe to be seen. And it was like 11 bucks which should normally go for about 6-7 from all the other places I've been.   Potato dish was wayyyyy to salty and was too spicy, not like good spicy like all i tasted was like chili oil which is weird since I have never seen this dish be so red and oily. Potato's were soggy and sliced super small.   The steam/cold chicken had no flavor and some weird sauce and it was over cooked and very tough.   Lotus root was ok, it had a little flavor which is normal for this dish but was still on the bland side.   Cumin lamb was terrible, they used like the thin hot pot style lamb so it was over cooked and tough and there was barely any in there. There was more onions than anything else.   The only thing that was decent was the chicken feet which I don't eat but my GF and her sister said it was fine.   Just crazy I spent over 80 bucks on probably the worst \"authentic\" Chinese place and I was hoping it would be good since it was close to me.   Drive a few miles East and try Original Cuisine instead. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"I would like to review the food but I can not. After waiting several  minutes  I called out and a extremely rude gentleman said \"I am very busy come back later. No one here to help you\". He then turned his back to me and went back into the back.   If you are not able to take orders or help a walk in customer why wouldn't you put up a closed or be back soon sign?"}
{"text":"BEST SERVICE & the food is great!  You are probably wondering about the food.  I've had a hard time finding a decent Chinese restaurant in the Phoenix area since I moved here 3 years ago.  This place finally checks all the boxes.  Affordable lunch specials.  Food is tasty and not extra greasy.  You get a generous portion of soup and an egg roll with the lunch special.  The portion size looks smaller than usual but it's plenty for a full meal of leftovers the next day. AND the to-go boxes are substantial enough to be re-used at home.  They are really nice boxes.  Is only a to-go place.  No tables so set expectations accordingly.  The place is super clean and has adorable decor if you go pick up yourself.  Reason I'm leavings this review: I accidentally left my wallet there the other day and they went waaaay out of their way to try and return it to me.  They went to the address on my license, which is old.  I get there to pick it up and all the cash is in there and everything.  The young lady at the restaurant refused the tip I tried to give her for the trouble.  I was so relieved as I was 30 min away from leaving for a flight.  I shoved some cash in the tip jar and ran away. :)  If they are this honest with my wallet, you can trust they are cooking your food to the highest quality and standards.  And they have a coupon program on the receipt.  Keep an eye out for that.  I love coupons."}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food.  Would recommend tying it.  Martin the chef was great in helping us pick out flavors."}
{"text":"I am torn about giving this review: This is good Kung Pao chicken, not salty for my taste, authentic by San Francisco and hotel Chinese chefs standards. It had chiles that look like fried prune skins, good peanuts, onions, lots of chicken, baby corn, pieces of oyster mushrooms and a veggie that I didn't recognize. Now I have never been to China but I don't think the rice is supposed to be mushy for fried rice.  I had the lunch special which included egg drop soup and egg roll both were good. It took some time to get my order out because I didn't order ahead of time.  The usual cashier was out running an errand, my guess it was the owner's daughter. He kept trying to charge my credit card and in his defense he is the chef/cook and not the cashier. I will give them another try and maybe order noodles, but I do agree with one of the other Yelpers that a Chinese restaurant should get the rice \"right\". The saddest part is that I did NOT receive a \"happy cookie\" as my niece likes to call it. No fortune cookie, my future is doomed!"}
{"text":"I ordered the lotus root dish and ,omg I think they put sugar instead of salt and my whole dish is sweeeet !"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great lunch specials. The fried rice is on point. I also recommend the kung pao chicken or the orange chicken. Great selection of drinks and teas as well!"}
{"text":"Newly open establishment. Very friendly. Food was ok!  Pretty pricey definitely expected more bang for my buck!  Overall, I would try them again."}
{"text":"I always walk RIGHT by this place when I am grabbing lunch at Hummus Xpress.. I have been wanting to give it a try.   Today I did just that, with a few traditional dishes I normally would get from Original Cuisine which is down the street, but this spot is closer to me by 15 min or so, so I was hoping for the same great outcome.   Sadly, I was wrong, the cold dish usually like, which is a beef dish was so salty and somehow was really hard and chewy, maybe they are trying to go natural. The soup ordered was so bland, it's like they should have added the salt from the beef dish to my soup so I got some flavor. The rice was mushy, like how do you mess up on rice from a Chinese restaurant. I think I will stick to my other go to chinese places for food."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, not only was it close by but they stated that they offered \"authentic\" Chinese food. What we got was mostly dried peppers and onions, plus the dishes were super salty. We could not even eat it. We just ended up tossing most of the items we ordered. Food was not good and it was overpriced. I would not mind paying more for good quality food.   I would not recommend this place and definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"As a native Chinese, I could say this place is one if the best place for Chinese food in town. Their dishes are mostly like sichuan flavor, which is a little bit spicy and salty. Recommand Yu-shiang Eggplant, my favorite dish. PS. try their app and they deliver food directly to your home."}
{"text":"This place has amazing authentic Chinese food, and they give you a bunch of food for the price. I have been to China many times, and Bamboo Grill Yard gives food that is closest to what I experienced while in China while still being a simple take out place, which is exactly what I want for lunch."}
{"text":"This is a disappointing example of the business making a mistake and having the customer pay for it. I ordered through Doordash and one of my orders was a lunch special. Now, I go to another place which has lunch specials until 3p so I didn't think anything of it when I placed my order. The restaurant waited until my order was to be picked up to tell them that lunch specials end at 2p. So my driver had to call me to let me know when my order should have already been completed, that I can't get the lunch special.  There's nothing stopping you from ordering a lunch special after 2p on the app and there's nothing noting the time the special expires. I would think, since it was the restaurants error that it would be simple enough to just give me the order as a lunch special, and get the wrong info. fixed asap. But instead, my driver had to call to apologies for them. Not a way to get a new customer to become a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I order the steam Chicken with chili oil from the cold dish  .it tastes amazing and just like eat in China.it's with bone and not too salty and not too spicy .just perfect I like it .I recommend try it if you love traditional food ."}
