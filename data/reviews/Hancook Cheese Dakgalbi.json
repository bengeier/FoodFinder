{"text":"Lots of liquid in the dakgalbi, not a lot of chicken or cabbage too. 
Sauce was good though, tasted a little sweet which I liked. Love the cheese, actually seperates so that you can grab something and you'll def get the cheese with it.
The free mini dishes they give you was a bit weird. Mac and cheese, corn and radishes? Did not like, would def prefer the traditional dishes. 
I like that they give you a free red bean ice shaved dessert. Was very tasty!"}
{"text":"We usually get double cheese, double rice cake, and ramen. If you don't mind being warm, satisfied, and guilty at the same time, this is the right place to go."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the Cheese Dakgalbi and Seafood Pancake! Conveniently located by Bathurst station, it is a must try for cheese and Korean food lovers. I will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"The restaurant replaced Joon's and thank goodness for that!  Food is much more flavourful,  portions are decent,  staff are friendlier and most importantly,  the chicken comes fully cooked. I've never really understood the hype that surrounded Joon's so I'm happy for this seemingly better replacement."}
{"text":"the Best spicy checken on Bloor.  
if add Cheese on it?
Mmm Yummy! 
Fantastic Ensemble!!
Don't forget the Free Desert,
it is my favorite part."}
{"text":"So I've been noticing, cheese on Korean dishes seems to be a hit with the foodie community recently. I was curious and wanted to give it a try. To be honest, at first it seemed like an odd combination but having tried it, its delicious! If you like cheese and spicy Korean dishes, you'll want to give this combination a try. 

We ordered the cheese dakgalbi. Dakgalbi is essentially chicken, cabbage and rice cake in a spicy pepper sauce. The cheese version has cheese drizzled on top. When you order dakgalbi (cheese or no cheese) you can order a single serving or a double serving. You can also add in things like rice, ramen or more chicken, cabbage and etc at an extra cost of course. 

My cousin and I opted for the single serving and added ramen with it.  We also ordered a pork bone in case the single serving wasnt enough. The dakgalbi came out sizzling on a hot plate. It was super delicious. The ramen was a perfect add on. I don't think it would've tasted as good had we not ordered it with ramen. The cheese was stringy, the sauce was spicy and sweet and the ramen was cooked perfectly. There was only 4 rice cakes in ours which I personally thought was very little but I'm not a huge fan of rice cake anyways. 

Unless you really love dakgalbi, I personally think sharing a single serving and second dish would be the better way to go if it's just two people."}
{"text":"I come here every time I go to Toronto, and I'll order the cheese dakgalbi every time. Finish it off with a few bowls of rice to make fried rice, and, honestly, a food outing can't get any better. Last time we went to the restaurant with a group of 20, we managed to get in and out in around an hour and a half, which is honestly amazing for a party that size. Huge fan, will be coming back next time I visit the city for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here today after roaming around Bloor Street... We wanted to have free Japanese souffle pancakes at Fuwa Fuwa and then go for $5 Kinton Ramen, but the line ups were INSANE. So we found this place and decided to have Korean food instead. 

My sister ordered the cheese dakgalbi which came with chicken, cheese, cabbage, sweet potato slices, and a few pieces of deokbokki. After asking the waitress / owner, I chose to order the spicy squid instead of the gamjatang and bibimbap... Unfortunately, I really regretted it afterwards as I didn't find the spicy squid that good. Both the dakgalbi and spicy squid were on the sweet side; the spicy squid was still tolerable as the spiciness balanced it out, but the dakgalbi was too sweet. In fact, it got to the point where my sister couldn't stand it afterwards and felt sick post-meal. Honestly, by the end of the meal, both plates seemed to blur together and taste the same.

The banchan that accompanied the mains were very interesting! There was a pickled radish dish that I thoroughly enjoyed, along with a very interesting spiced macaroni dish, and a creamy corn potato salad. I didn't quite enjoy the macaroni, but the corn potato salad was a trip down memory lane.

We ended dinner with the free dessert, which is shaved ice with evaporated milk and topped with red bean paste. The red bean paste was slightly on the sweet side, and so I didn't finish all of the toppings. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the shaved ice particularly with the milk."}
{"text":"I ordered cheese dakgalbi. Food is good but it takes half an hour to get the food ready for you."}
{"text":"We came for the 4/5 ratings but I was really disappointed. First of all, the prices are $1 - $2 more than other Korean restaurants. I was really surprised to see that the side dishes was a corn/apple mayo mix, a dry macaroni mix, and plain radish...no kimchi or potatoes. I ordered the PBS which should not go wrong. The broth tasted very watered down and did not have the expected complexity of flavours from spices. There were very few pork bones and the meat was tough. A small hard piece of potato and few kimchi. My friends got their cheesy chicken and it had very few pieces of chicken or rice cakes (mostly cabbage) for almost $14. They also had a pork fried rice which looked tiny considering it was still $9."}
{"text":"Was craving spicy rice cake with cheese so decided to try this place on a Friday after work. We ordered the cheese dakgalbi and added udon noodles. The chicken was well marinated and flavourful. My only complaint is that the meat pieces were small, there weren't enough rice cakes (only like 8 pieces), and the cabbage was quite chewy and difficult to bite into. It was just the right amount of sweet and spicy."}
{"text":"Got the dakgalbi and added ramen noodles to it which made it more filling. For just one portion, I found it extremely filling and I was super full at the end of my meal. It was pretty good with the vegetables and sauce and noodles, but there could've been more rice cakes and it was hard to mix everything around since it was on a hot plate not a bowl. My friend got the pork soup or something and that was pretty good, it came bubbling hot. However my dakgalbi was a lot more expensive then I expected, $14 with tax and I had to add tips on top of that. My friends meal was only about $8, so I spent almost double. For the side dishes, we didn't get any of the usual stuff like kimchi. Instead we got blocks of radish, some macaroni and corn. The radish tasted good, the corn was ok but slightly weird, and the macaroni had no taste to it so the side dishes can definitely be better. Overall, not sure if I will come back since there are many other Korean restaurants here."}
{"text":"My sister and I got the dakgalbi and I feel like I can already guestimate what the portion size for a single serving (3 rice cakes, 1 cup of cabbage, a few slices of potato, a decent scoop of chicken). We were eating and realized that the portion was not enough to fill us up, especially because there was only 3 rice cakes per portion- so we ordered extra udon for $2.50 which was maybe a cup? Also make sure to turn up the heat of the pan if you want it hotter than what they set it to. The sauce was salty but delicious and the meal could have easily been a 5 star if the portion was larger and had more rice cakes. Prompt service."}
{"text":"We walked into Hancook on a Sunday afternoon, as we were just walking around checking out the hood. I had the soft tofu soup with pork and my charming companion had the pork bone soup - we split a seafood pancake. 

The tofu soup was bubbling hot and spicy - there was lot of tofu in that bowl. I had some tastes of the pork bone soup which was delicious and there was plenty of meet on the bones. My companion approved highly and left nothing but a bowl of clean bones. 

We are always on the lookout for a great seafood pancake (we have been disappointed at times) and this one was top notch. Chewy, gooey and with enough seafood chunks to make it taste like it's name suggests. 

A nice place and a good value - the soups were a dollar off before 4PM.  

We have had our fair share of Korean food and we thought this place was pretty good. That being said we haven't even begun to scratch the surface of what is on offer in Toronto so we don't have much local to compare it to... yet."}
{"text":"For those who have been to Joons and are expecting the same quality you
might as well venture to the yonge and Sheppard location because this restaurant isn't as good. 

My friend and I were in the area and wanted some good old Joon to only find out its been replaced with Hancock Cheese Dakgalbi. After walking back and fourth in denial we decided to give it a chance. Upon walking in we were greeted by the owner who was very friendly and told us how the menu worked. We ordered two orders of the Chicken with rice cakes ramen and cheese. We were amazed .. at the portion, it was a lot more than what Joons would usually give. The flavour was not the same the sauce was sweeter than spicy and the chicken wasn't as fresh as Joons would usually provide. Without comparison, this place wouldve gotten a better review but if you are going to open up in the exact same spot serving the one thing people would go there for, there is going to be a comparison.

Overall the dakgaibi isn't terrible but it isn't the same, we did not try anything else because dakgaibi itself is very filling for 2. 

The service was good we felt very welcomed and taken cared of

The environment is similar to what Joons had as they didn't really change much of the decor but it wasn't as busy which was nice (for us)."}
{"text":"I came here with friends around 9pm (1 hour before closing on Sunday) and the establishment was still popping with diners.  This is a very good sign, especially since this is in the heart of K-town (Christie Station/Bathurst Station) where there are many other competing Korean restaurants.  

We ordered:

- Dukbokki: It was very cheap with it being 6-7 dollars before tax and tip, but the portion size was very small, even though it was to act as a shareable dish.   It did not have many slices of tofu skin or other ingredients besides the rice cakes, which may appeal to some, but I generally prefer having an even mixture. 


- Dukgalbi (without cheese 'cause a friend was lactose intolerant - poor him!): This was about 9 dollars and it was portioned large enough for two people with average appetites.  It had a good mixture of suace, chicken, and vegetables.  My companions liked this dish the most out of what we ordered and I do admit that it was very good for the price and portion size.  This is their staple dish and I do recommend purchasing this, as I do not see this being served very often in other restaurants in the area. The only down-side with this is that, unlike their other entrees,  this does not come with rice.  Rice is very cheap, fortunately ($1 per bowl).  If you're restricting your carb-intake, don't sweat it!

- Grilled pork hot plate (forgot the name): This was my favourite dish out of the three.  It was very flavourful and the pieces of pork were small enough to create a burst of saucy goodness in your mouth.  This was the same price as the Dukgalbi, and it was only a little smaller in portion-size. 

- Red bean bingsu: This was FREE!  Unlike the ubiquitous green tea/mango/red bean ice cream that many people are accustomed to receiving as a complimentary item after their dinners, the staff here serve red bean shaved ice.  It was very refreshing and the red bean had a good sweetness to it.

Overall, my companions and I really liked the restaurant.  For my bf and I, this will be another date spot as the prices were very fair and we will come back for the cheese dukgalbi. This is great for the budget-conscious."}
{"text":"I love Korean food and I love cheese. Cheese on spicy Korean food is the perfect combination. 

I came here in a group of four people. We ordered the classic cheese dakgalbi with ramen noodles. Honestly, this is the perfect comfort food. I found the portion was generous, but from glancing at the nearby tables, it would seem that the amount of food isn't alway proportional to the number of people, so I guess that's something to watch out for. 

The side dishes were... unconventional. You wouldn't find them at other Korean restaurants (mac and cheese... whaaaaattt??). Wasn't a huge fan of the side dishes but that won't stop me from coming back! Cheese is my weakness."}
{"text":"We came here specifically for the Dakgalbi, and Hancook did not disappoint! On a Sunday evening, it was a quiet and relaxed place to eat.
The banchan (appetizers) came out right away. I have never seen 2 of the three appetizers before, so that was an interesting start to our meal. Each of us had a three-sectioned plate serving the 3 banchan: pickled radish (or maybe it was turnip - this I have had before, and it is always really refreshing, setting you up nicely for your meal). The second of the two appetizers was macaroni, lightly spiced. I found it a bit bland, but ate it all. It was nicely al dente. I had no idea that macaroni was part of Korean side-dishes, but surprise! The third of the banchan was even more surprising - a warm mini-salad of corn and apples.
Corn and apples, you ask? We all kind of stared at it and thought ... what?? However, it turned out to be an inspired side-dish. Some light onion flavoured ingredient (maybe scallion or finely chopped shallot) added a zing, the apple added a crisp and slightly tart texture/flavour and the corn tasted like really fresh corn. It was a treat, and a pleasant surprise. Difficult to pick up with chopsticks, but with something this satisfying, even the clumsiest of us managed to eat their portion!

We also tried the beverage called Grapefruit Chamisul, which we split between the three of us. One of our diners was skeptical of this order: he described his past experience of Chamisul as a beverage which tasted like vodka mixed with tap water. This was quite different than that. True, it is a relatively mild, clear liquor, but we enjoyed it because the grapefruit taste lent it a fragrance and essence that was undeniably grapefruit-y without being too tart.

So far in our meal, thumbs up all around! (Well the macaroni, not so much, but everything else, yes!). Another YES! when the Dakgalbi arrived. Wow, was it nice ... pleasantly spicy, lots of cabbage and finely chopped chicken pieces, and about 5 or 6 rice cakes. We ordered steamed rice on the side. Next time, I will order more rice cakes, because those really enhance the dish. Seriously, I advise you to do this if you try the Dakgalbi at Hancook. The flavours and textures of all the ingredients - the chicken, sweet potatoes, cabbage, carrot, scallion all combine perfectly with the hot sauce so that no single ingredient predominates. Just a delicious, savoury and spicy flavour. More rice cakes were the only thing that would have made it better, and we could have had that if only we had ordered more! Oh well, next time ....

We did not have the cheese version. Somehow, cheese and Dakgalbi doesn't go together in my mind (even though Maangchi, the great Korean cook and blogger, posted a recipe for it). Maybe someday I will summon the nerve and try it. The couple beside us had ordered it. Their Dakgalbi arrived on a sizzling iron plate, heated by a burner which is brought to your table. The charming waitstaff (they were pleasant throughout the meal) showed up and showered the Dakgalbi with cheese that looked to be freshly grated mozzarella. Some day, I will summon the nerve and order it. For now, it seems a dissonance in my mind. But they clearly enjoyed it.

Parking around there seems hectic at first, but the is a Green P parking lot opposite the PAT Korean grocery, and also other Green P parking lots. You might have to drive around for a few minutes to find one with a free spot, but there is parking if you do not fear to drive the side-streets.

Hancook is also nicely located in Korea-town, near the fantastic Han-Ji paper store and also the PAT grocery store. The PAT grocery is worth a browse, and the Hanji is certainly worth looking at. A nice night out in K-Town, Toronto!"}
{"text":"The  here is just ok. Not spicy at all and the chicken tasted frozen. You get a decent portion for the price in Toronto... you also get a free bingsu (shaved ice) after you order a dinner meal but it's a joke. Literally a small cup of ice with red bean on top. Probably will not come back here"}
{"text":"This little Korean restaurant is located just below  stairs (For those who can't find it)! I came here with my friend and the food was great. We ordered the rice cake with cheese and a side of ramen. The pot itself came with rice cakes, carrots, sweet potatoes, cabbage and fish cakes. The cost for it came up to be around ~$15 per person, which is cheaper than your average Korean hotpot. Even though it looks like there isn't a lot, the cheese came up to be pretty filling so definitely not worth the extra if you're not too hungry."}
{"text":"We had the dakgalbi regular (without cheese) which is a big pan of hot sauce,  cabbage,  chicken and rice cakes cooked together. It was sweet, spicy and yummy, although a tad too spicy for my tastes (I have normal spice tolerance. They serve the dish to you in a pan on top of a portable gas cooktop on the table. 

We also ordered the chicken fried rice and pork bone soup. Both were very flavourful. The rice was a little bit clumped together in my opinion and the pork in the soup was a bit dry. I can think of many other restaurants with better pork bonesoup.  

There is greenp parking 1 minute walk away from this location."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday night and the restaurant was reasonably packed. We ordered the cheese dakgalbi for two, with the initial thought of having fried rice with the leftover sauce at the end (to get the fried rice, there was a minimum of a \"two people\" order since it was served on a hot plate if ordered for one). Neither my boyfriend nor I liked rice cakes so I asked if we could have the rice cakes replaced by something (e.g. more cabbage, white rice) but the waiter refused because the whole dish for two only had 3 rice cakes, which I found quite stingy especially since it was a two people portion. 

The dakgalbi was very tasty and quite spicy (if you are not used to eating spicy, I'd recommend to ask to have it toned down). What was disappointing though was the amount of food we got and we couldn't even order fried rice at the very end because there was no sauce left in the pot to fry the rice with. 

Overall, the food tastes good but the portions are below average, I'd recommend, if possible, to get a three person size for two if you are big eaters."}
{"text":"Great place, I was so glad I went! Awesome food and service! Loved the corn (appetizer). Food portion was perfect for my boyfriend and I, we couldn't finish the rice and still feel full. Absolutely will go back:)"}
{"text":"First time I'm trying Hancook since Joons restaurant. 

The place is ok, the service is good. But... 

Usually, I'm always trying the pork bone soup before anything else. There are many great places for that in the area. 

What a disappointment. No taste, the meat is not as soft as it should be, there is a tiny piece of potatoe. For the same price,  somewhere else you will get more tasty soup and meat and so much that it will be hard to finish. 

Also the side dishes are not too Korean. Macaroni,  corn and a kimchi that is not kimchi. To me it's a Korean with a Western style :) 

Alone, I will probably come back to try another dish,  but definitely I will not bring my friends here for now."}
{"text":"had a great experience in Hancook cheese Dakgalbi! The food is sooo good, after I had hot pot noodles I immediate order more to pack to bring home.
The service is great! Very considerate and attentive! Helped me to pack the hot pot noodles! Very helpful and efficient!"}
{"text":"They do not have many choices... we ordered pork pot with extra cheese and tarpaulin beef, seafood pie. It was heavy tho...."}
{"text":"Another visit to Hancock.  Had the dakgalbi with cheese this time.  It was delicious!  The cheese was so thick and flavourful - def add more taste to the meal.  Recommend getting it with cheese with added ramen.  There was actually very little fish cake so I would consider ordering more on the side. 

The porkbone soup here is actually very good - plentiful kimchi, \"sweet-spicy\" soup base and adequate amt of pork with it coming off the bone easily. 

Again, free appetizers of macaroni, corn and radish.  And free red bean dessert for dinner. 

Consistent food - solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"For a random \"hey let's just try this!\", I am a fan! They started off with some side dish plate (macaroni salad and something else, my memory escapes me!) For the main, we ordered the  the Spicy Chicken Cheese Dakgalbi for 2 people. Given that we both love cheese, it was delicious and really complimented the whole classic spicy dakgalbi. My suggestion is to add sides as necessary as there is not a lot of rice cake. We opted for rice and udon, If you are ever around the area, love cheese and want something a bit different from all the other korean restaurants around, come try this place out!!!"}
{"text":"The location of Hancook was once Joons Restaurant that served similar Dalgalbi's as well. But as a new opened Hancook Cheese Dakgalbi I really like how your able to order one portion of the dalgalbi compared to where joons you were required to order 2 or more. Ordering 1 serving was by accident because i went with 2 other people and it was suppose to serve all of us, but because we also ordered the seafood pancake, which i Highly recommend, and their chicken kimchi fried rice, the one portion of dalgalbi was just right for all three of us. We really enjoyed our meals there as we shared everything together. Their side dishes were awesome as well, usually they give out one of everything and its for everyone to share, but they gave us each our own portion of side dishes which was different and i didn't have to share or hoard the sides! AWESOME.
We went for dinner so after our meals they offered us FREE patbingsoo (shaved ice with red bean paste) it was a great way to cool my mouth from the spice and it added a nice sweetness to the end of the meal.
I would definitely be coming back more than once!"}
{"text":"Visit this place really often for their delicious cheese dakgalbi. They are one of the only restaurants that serve this. It's pretty much ramen, cheese, chicken and vegetables covered in spicy sauce.  

If you haven't tried it, you should definitely try. It is located at the basement. In Korean town."}
{"text":"FOOD - 4.5/5
We ordered the cheese dakgalbi for 2 and an additional 2 bowls of rice which came up to only $30 in total! Before our main dish arrived, we were given each a set of banchan which included spicy macaroni, creamy corn, and pickled radish. The creamy corn was my favourite. It was so light yet so indulgent. As for the main dish, dakgalbi is essentially Korean spicy stir fried chicken with veggies such as cabbage and carrots in a gochujang based sauce. The pan was placed on a gas burner at our table and the chicken was topped with cheese. My favourite part of the dish was the rice cakes. I immediately fell in love with its gooey and chewy texture combined with the sweet and spicy sauce. I loved every aspect of the dish and it paired very well with our steamed rice. At the end of the meal you also get a FREE red bean ice dessert which really helped cool things off. (Only offered during dinner)

SERVICE 5/5
The server was extremely kind and explained to us the various menu offerings. I really loved their courtesy and patience when we had questions. 

OVERALL - 5/5
This was probably one of my favourite places to have a great meal in K-town without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"After passing by one day, came back specifically for the cheese dakgalbi which costs a couple dollars more than its non-cheese version, The dish is described as \"Stir-frying marinated chicken in a red pepper paste, cabbage, sweet potato, carrot, rice cake, and green onion together on a hot pan...covered with mozzarella cheese.\" Dined solo, so got the version for one person which comes on a sizzling plate. It's one of those dishes that has so many ingredients that you don't know where to start cause everything looks and smells so good. The sauce is very sweet with a little kick of spice and heat reminiscent of red pepper paste. Although it doesn't absolutely need steamed rice cause of the rice cake, some rice would have been good to balance out the flavors. My favorite part was scraping the caramelized bits of saucy this or that off the previously sizzling platter as I worked my way to the bottom. Also got banchan (side dishes) including corn niblets, macaroni, and radish. Although quite good, the dakgalbi tastes monotonous with one note of flavor bite after bite regardless if it's chicken or sweet potato. Therefore, I recommend getting this along with one or two other dishes if you're going to try it. Located down a flight of steps from street level so I'm not sure it is accessible to those with mobility issues."}
{"text":"Everything on their menu is good but the only thing that makes me not want to come is the amount of duk (rice cakes) they actually put in the dakgalbi. The first time I got it, it was for 2 people and there were only around 5 pieces of it. The second time was only 1 serving but they gave us 3 pieces. I would have given this place 5 stars but it was just that point."}
{"text":"One of my favourites for korean food- they do the cheese dakgalbi really well! Only thing I order when I come here because it's my favourite korean dish. Always choose the opinion with cheese and add ramen. The only disappointment would be the side dishes because they don't give you the traditional dishes and they also give you really little (only 3-4 dishes). I've gone to other places as have gotten as many as 9 side dishes. However, the price of the food is great and well worth it, cheaper than some of the other places down Bloor."}

{"text":"Tried the Cheese Dakgalbi with added ramen. So tasty! They put a nice amount of cheese, however there was barely any rice cakes.  

Also tried the bibimbap which was good as well!

Food came out really fast. Great for the price and quality. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to the Joons that used to be here but this place is definitely not on par with Joons!!!

Ordered the cheese dakgalbi with ramen noodle add-on for 2 people. The portion was more like for one person and rice cakes were minimal and there weren't any sweet potato at all even though it was listed on the menu!

Kind of disappointed - will rather go back to Joons. This place will be ok for a quick dakgalbi fix if you're not that hungry."}
{"text":"Not bad, but the portion of food is tooooo small
The smallest portion of korean food in spadina area

There are plenty korean restaurents with same price , larger portion and taste better"}
{"text":"I should preface this with the fact that, in my opinion, I make the best dak galbi ever at home, just because it's made precisely to my preferences. But when I'm too lazy to do the work, and because I'm a dak galbi fiend who craves it regularly, I like to know that I can go somewhere that does it well, and I'm happy to report I've found my place.

This was much better than any experience I'd ever had at Joon's - refer to my review for more detail.

I was super pleased to learn that this place offers single servings of dak galbi for solo diners, so I came here by myself on the weekend. As everyone else had already mentioned, the banchan really wasn't great, but it wasn't a huge deal. Service was courteous but minimal, which was just fine with me.

My platter came after a short wait and it was covered - and I mean COVERED - with cheese. My kind of heaven! I added ramen to my order, and it was cooked just right - not too soft, not undercooked. There wasn't a ton of chicken/veggies, but with my ramen I was stuffed, and I didn't need to order rice on top - so I think the portions were pretty reasonable. The sauce was deliciously savoury but quite a lot sweeter than I expected (and sweeter than when I make it), but it was pretty good, all things considered. I really liked that they used dark meat - it's the only way to do it.

I did make the mistake of ordering ramen with mine while I was wearing a white shirt, so I got tiny, little spots of sauce on my shirt that won't wash out, unfortunately. But it was worth it!

Something else I'd like to note is the fact that, unlike Joons, they don't charge extra for veggies, which is how I think it should be. Veggies should be a default ingredient and it is, here. 

I'd absolutely return, and next time, with a companion!"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat kimchi fried chickens and drink with friends! The price is fair for sharing and go with more people. Authentic spicy sauce from korea, I would say. 

The sauce is good but it might be a little bit heavy if there is too much cheese on top. 

Will suggest to add cheese for a few dollars but ask the server not to add all of the cheese at once but put some aside and add later on by yourself according to preferences. 


Cheers! 
Ideasnfood T."}
{"text":"Yummy cheese dakgalbi! Can't go wrong with that. Definitely add some ramen and rice cakes to it. The servers are quite nice, you just have to call them to the table if you need anything. Not the proactive ones, but it's kind of the norm for most Korean restaurants. The side dishes are interesting and different, but good. I used to come to this place a lot as a university student to eat Dakgalbi when this restaurant was still JOONS. It's now HANCOOK and probably not even associated to one another, but the main food is still very similar."}
