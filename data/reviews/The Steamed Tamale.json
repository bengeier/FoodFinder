{"text":"Amazing new restaurant with excellent food and service! Chiles from Hatch, New Mexico! Would recommend to anyone craving a tamale or taste of authentic Mexican food located near 18th Ave and Van Buren St."}
{"text":"The green tamales were delicious. i walked to the Steamed Tamale because  i work just  2 minutes away. By the time i got back to the office needless to say the tamales were gone. Worth the trip and reasonably priced. Owner/staff were very friendly. I hope they stay around."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place and it will definitely be in my regular rotation of small locally owned restaurants in downtown Phoenix.  The owner Brian is friendly and takes great pride in the quality of his cuisine which reflects his southern New Mexico roots.  I am excited to find a restaurant that has made from scratch red and green chile sauce using New Mexico chiles...the distinctive flavors are wonderful.  The green chile sauce was smooth and slightly sweet while the red sauce has a hearty kick ... I sampled both and like them both.  Tamales are generously proportioned with good flavor..basic red pork and green chile varieties on hand and these classics are done well. Good to see they offer takeout tamales by the 1/2 dozen.     I was happy to see flat enchiladas on the specials menu...a  New Mexico specialty menu item that is hard to find on menus around here.  Delicious and generously sauced to perfection.   Convenient parking lot right next to the restaurant on the west side.  The seating area seemed clean and bright, it is probably bustling at lunchtime.   Great job Brian, I will see you again soon."}
{"text":"Delicious tamales made with New Mexico Hatch chile... Generous portions served at a very reasonable price! If you like it HOT, ask for the Owner Brian ' s red salsa... Tomato going in... Fire going down!!! Come se dice' delicioso?"}
{"text":"My expectations were crushed. Phoenix needs a Tucson Tamale like place with a wide selection of fun and delcious tamales.  Alas the Steamed Tamale only offers two, A beef tamale and a corn one. Even more confusing is that by default the non meat tamale comes in a green meet sauce.  The corn Tamale it self was bland and their normal prices are not cheap.   There are a few seats inside and a few dirty tables on the patio. Not very inviting.  This was a one time visit for me."}
{"text":"The Steamed Tamale is no longer, but Little King of  Kings is. Second time here and you can't go wrong for 2.99 rice bowls. I'VE had the teriyaki and sweet and sour. Both times I asked for extra veggies and enjoyed them both. The added Steamed broccoli was great. Best lunch on a budget downtown."}
{"text":"Thought this place was really ghetto at first then a friend told me I had to eat here. I was definitely blown away by the food. This guy makes the best green tamales I've ever had. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Tamales were great as well as chicken burrito! Customer service was top notch! I give this place a 10 and more!"}
{"text":"Tamales are dense and bland.  Not a fan.  However, their enchiladas are scrumptious and cheesy.  Rice and beans are okay, not terrific, and you need to add salt for a bit more flavor. They only charge 75c for soda, however, you need to bring in your own cup. Who carries their own cup with them when eating out?  I wouldn't mind paying $1.00 for a soda (any size) because that is what McDonalds and Carl's Jr. charges.  (Cup included!)"}
