{"text":"I just had one of the best meals and best service I have experienced in a long time. Heidi was absolutely wonderful, she was friendly and not too assertive. She definitely made our night special. Also, not to forget about thee fantastic food and perfect portion sizes. It's the best way to enjoy a little bit of everything. I can not wait to come back and try something different because I'm sure it will be just as good. Thank you for making my night so incredible!!!"}
{"text":"A Major Scam for the Price:
(A) Terrible service: We didn't get our bread until we had started our appetizer.
(B) Mediocre Food: Tomatoes were hard & tasteless like you'd find at Giant Eagle; salad was ridiculous--mainly cheap iceberg lettuce with a few tomato slices; main course was nothing special
(C) CASH-ONLY Accepted: WHO'S HEARD OF A RESTAURANT THAT DOESN'T TAKE CREDIT CARDS!!! I mean, even the tiny village restaurant near Nanjing, China takes my American Express card?! Oh yeah, they do post a tiny, hand-written sign near the entrance that states \"Cash & Personal Checks Accepted\". C'mon, they take personal checks but not credit cards?!"}
{"text":"All I can say is #13! I don't even know what it is called but it is my favorite! Everything on the menu is great but #13 is my favorite. I have a hard time not getting it when I go there. My family has been going since it opened and now they know us by name--woops! The staff is great. Best part is I always have a little to take home for leftovers!

Take out is just as delicious! 

Now that I have moved from Cleveland I crave it when I come back home. They have recently started bottling some of their sauces that I was not leaving home without. You can buy it at Heinens. It is great! 

Always busy so make sure to call ahead!"}
{"text":"What the heck is all the hype about?  Cash only...okay I guess.  Very crowded, small tables on top of each other,  food was average at best and it was way overpriced.   Probably not fair for 1 star but this place was so hyped the let down was enormous."}
{"text":"The best Italian place I have ever been to. The gnoki with vesuvian sauce is the best!"}
{"text":"In my mind, small as it is (I mean my mind, although 'Stino is small as well), there are few places better than 'Stino Da Napoli. The atmosphere is charming and welcoming. The place is small and neighborly. It's your local place. I can't even tell you how many \"regulars\" go to 'Stino. The number is \"very many\". They play opera or other appropriate music at a low key level....it's Italian through and through, but sophisticated without being \"fancy\" or uppity.  As soon as you walk in, there is a sincere and friendly greeting. It could be Nate, Sean, or Helen. Professional, on the ball, friendly, sincere. They've all been there for years. It could even be 'Stino himself! Yes, he is real. And he is a great chef. 'Stino's food is legendary. His smile is sparkling and welcoming. Such a happy guy! But back to the food. There are thirteen pastas on the menu. Except for the cloud-like gnocchi, it's dry Italian pasta. Something for everyone. Penne, linguine, spaghetti, fettucine; every sauce is paired with the pasta shape that is just right to hold that sauce properly. Pasta Bolognese. Pasta Pomodoro....plain tomato sauce; how good could that be, you may ask yourself? Unbelievable.  Pasta Vesuvio (an incredibly delicious sauce made with pancetta, cream, and tomato sauce...heavenly!) Pasta with tomato/ prosciutto sauce. Pasta Puttanesca. Linguini with clams, red or white. Spaghetti Carbonara, the ideal: creamy yet still light, somehow. I can't even name all the pasta dishes, there are so many. They all sound like something you may have had before, but if you haven't had 'Stino's version, you haven't had the ultimate version of that pasta dish. Pure. Natural. Simple. Perfect. Pasta is cooked al dente and is consistent every time. There is an Insalata Di Mare with sparkling fresh shrimp, mussels, calamari, romaine, olives, carrots, peperoncini and a fresh lemon/olive oil dressing. The sea on a plate. The lasagna is yummy. The eggplant parmesan is a revelation. It's a Friday special. If you are lucky, they may have some left over for Saturday lunch (but don't take mine!). It's more like an eggplant Napoleon, since the paper-thin slices of eggplant are slowly cooked in high quality olive oil, then layered with that simply beautiful plain tomato sauce and sprinklings of quality Parmagiano-Reggiano. No heavy layers of ricotta or gooey mozzarella. No impenetrable breading, no deep frying. Just melting lusciousness. You must try this dish. Even if you don't care for eggplant, you'll go wild. You will never be able to go back to any other version of this dish without yearning for this. With each pasta dish you get a very reasonably-sized mixed salad (which means it's not too big to ruin your appetite); romaine, peperoncini, dark olive, green olive, cherry tomato (high quality all the way--no brown lettuce, no extraneous romaine ribs) and your choice of raspberry vinaigrette or lemon/olive oil. All house-made. A basket of crunchy, hot Ciabatta bread and unsalted butter is served alongside, and there is freshly grated real Parmagiano-Reggiano cheese. Some appetizers are: mussels in wine sauce. Sublime. Mozzarella (fresh) with tomato and fresh basil. Good even in winter. Calamari; sauteed, not fried in the usual way. Delightfully refreshing. We must discuss some of the entrees. My favorites are the Petto di Pollo Milanese ( #21?), a thinly pounded chicken breast (double) with the lightest, crispest, most delicate breading on earth. And lemon. SUCCULENT. Trouble is, once you try that, you won't be able to order anything else. Try the veal dishes. Veal Marsala. YUMMY. Simple and pure. Meaty, chewy mushrooms, veal that is paper-thin, tender, delicately breaded and sauteed to a golden cloud. High quality Marsala wine and butter sauce. When you order a chicken or veal dish, about two minutes later you'll hear pounding from the kitchen. That's your order. 'Stino doesn't pound that veal or chicken until he sees an order come in. The fish dishes are good; you are required to enjoy Tilapia.  The roasted peppers and fresh house-made Italian sausage are incredible. Savory, moist, crumbly handmade sausage, slowly roasted red and green peppers and onion, tomato sauce. This is the ONLY place on earth I have ever tasted a green pepper that I like. This place is not trendy, it's not a \"scene\", it's just the best restaurant on the West side of Cleveland, PERIOD. Good, short, well edited wine list. No hard liquor. They are expanding capacity soon. Go, but don't tell anybody else because we still want to get a seat! We absolutely adore Stino Da Napoli, and we cherish every meal we have there. CASH or checks ONLY. Reservations are recommended for dinner. Remember, it's a small, popular place. There is no place to wit for a table. Closed Sunday and Monday; open for lunch AND dinner only on Saturday."}
{"text":"Stino Dinapoli is the best Italian I've ever had.  I've always had great service and the atmosphere is elegant."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go for a great Italian meal. The food is always good and the service is the best. I am particularly fond of the Gnocchi.  It melts in your mouth. My husband likes the veal and seafood dishes.
I also love the Basil Martini. Tasty! 
The ambience of the restaurant is wonderful.
This is a date night must."}
{"text":"here's the thing: i am not a huge italian food fan. too heavy, not enough vegetables, etc. however, my mom has been dying to try this restaurant forever, so we finally stopped in this past week.

small/cozy inside - i'd imagine that on a weekend you'd want to make a reservation. we were there on a thursday night and were seated immediately no problem. key fact though, as everyone else has said: NO CREDIT CARDS ! gotta bring cash or write a personal check.

i ate all the bread, of course, and had a tossed salad - nothing to write home about really, but oh well.

my mom had the gnocchi which were EXCELLENT and i had one of the fettuncine dishes which involved broccoli, aglio e olio, mushrooms, fresh tomato, etc. it was very very good and exactly the kind of dish i wanted to be eating. i had the rest the next day and it was even better. 

in a rare turn of events we had dessert, splitting the white chocolate heart with the raspberry gelato center. very good, and i normally never eat dessert.

i can't imagine that i will be here often, but that's only a personal preference. it was definitely good - even if our server totally reminded me of john malkovich the whole time."}
{"text":"Best Italian in Cleveland. 

Three thing you must get that are authentic Italian: 1) calamari (it's not fried, because that's the weird American way and is not how they serve it in Italy!) 2) gnocchi - it's homemade little pillows of deliciousness!, and 3) the eggplant Parmesan (only on Fridays but it is insanely good - served in thin slices that aren't breaded; just baked together with delicious sauce!)."}
{"text":"Overpriced for mediocre food. I ordered gnocchi and it was raw. When I told the waiter, he picked it with an \"Okay\" and a few minutes later the chef came out to argue with me about raw versus soft gnocchi. My husband had the Piccatina Di Vitello Al Limone and it was tasty! But should have been served with pasta. Not an attractive dish and lacked creativity. Lovely atmosphere and location, but a very disappointing experience. Wouldn't recommend or return."}
{"text":"This was the worst service and meal we've had in Cleveland. The chef actually came out of the kitchen to confront my wife after she sent back her gnocchi for being under cooked. The gnocchi tasted like raw dough and were so soft the broke apart like extremely wet mashed potatoes. The chef was beyond rude and didn't even offer to make her something else for dinner. She left with only eaten half of a cheap salad and store bought rolls. The veal was under seasoned and the portions were not near worth what they charging for. You had to request pasta with the dish when ordering. To top it off, the waiter shorted me $10 in change and was rude when I brought it to his attention."}
{"text":"First rate Italian establishment. A lot of things are different than your everyday Italian joint yet they keep the best: first, be prepared to pay cash or check... yep no visa commercials here. The portions are not so humongous that you are ready to explode. Okay, that's where they are different. Now for quality, atmosphere, the music in the background... all first rate. When at a really good Italian or Greek place, one has to remember that the tables will be full, not much space between each other and it will be pretty vocal. But for the two seconds you are not paying attention to your family and friends, you want the feel like you are somewhere far away in Italy and everything will leave you with that impression down to the volume and type of music that is played."}
{"text":"December's date night brought us to Stino Da Napoli. I got a glowing recommendation from a friend, so we went for it! 

We made reservations, but the time we were going (6:30 on a Saturday) didn't really warrant one. However, within a half hour, the entire place was packed! Good to know.

We were initially offered a table in what I can only describe as an igloo -- a teeny alcove surrounded by block glass walls. Um, no thanks! The hostess actually said that people either love it or it makes them feel claustrophobic.

We were then brought to an entirely different room, one with a fireplace close to the kitchen. Now, this is more like it. It had a warm, charming vibe. Our server was extremely personable without being overbearing. I appreciated his knowledge of both the menu as well as the specials.

I went with the Fettuccine Alla Ferdinando II, featuring fresh mozzarella, basil, prosciutto, and tomato sauce. [Those of you who regularly read my reviews and care about this -- this is the dish I was attempting to recreate at Players which utterly failed.] It was DELICIOUS! Probably one of the most delicious portions of pasta I've ever eaten.

My husband went with the gnocchi, and he was floored at how amazing it was. We each had a salad too, with lemon/olive oil dressing, which was great. The bread was also excellent.

The fact that it's cash only really is not a big deal to me. So you have to either a) go to the ATM which is, oh wow, at the front of the restaurant, or b) you have to write a check. So what?

Five-star service, food, and feeling. A great experience!"}
{"text":"The best Italian restaurant around. This is authentic fare, with a menu that offers a multitude of choices. The veal is top notch and they have great espresso to cap off a great evening. Ciao!"}
{"text":"Ah, Augustino, it was good to know you...

When we started eating at Stino Da Napoli there were four tables. Augustino was often in the front and would chat with diners who said hello. The food was fantastic, the service excellent, the prices reasonable and the atmosphere cozy. That was more than 20 years ago.

We left Cleveland in 1998 and lamented the loss of our beloved Stino. Every time we land at Hopkins, without exception, Stino is our first stop before we head to the east side. When we arrived in Cleveland September 25th we headed to Stino to wait out rush hour before driving to our niece's house in Pepper Pike. I'm not sure we'll be back.

The food was excellent. The food has been excellent every time we've ever dined here (or taken it home when our kids were young and we were afraid they'd disturb the diners at the other three tables he had at that time). But when I walked in to the restaurant for my 6pm reservation the hostess made clear that I couldn't have been more of an inconvenience. When I gave her my name and the reservation time she looked me up and down and busied herself with other things. (Now, I'd been flying cross-country since 6:50am but I was properly dressed and behaved, though I probably looked tired.) After ignoring me for a couple of minutes several people walked in. She immediately moved around me to help them, behaving in an obsequious manner. I was getting pissed. I had been so excited to revisit one of my favorite restaurants; I did not come all that way to be snubbed. Eventually she returned, pointed to three tables and told me I could take one of those.

The waiter was fine and the food was excellent. We had Spaghetti Al Fumo Del Vesuvio and Pesto with Shrimp. We did not see Augustino, though we didn't expect to. It had been many years since we'd encountered him in the dining room. We bought two jars of the Vesuvio ($8/ea) to take home to our daughters and left. The food may have been five stars but the experience brought it down to 2.5.

Now I appreciate that Augustino has enjoyed great success. Our weekly take-out back in the early days probably helped. We've taken many people there over the years and, as I said, made it a point to begin our Cleveland trips there. But we were treated like a bastard step-child this last time and, frankly, the place loses more of it's warmth and soul with each expansion. I just can't help but compare Stino's with my favorite Italian restaurant in North Beach - Sodini's. We don't get there very often because we live in southern, not northern California. But every year or two we visit and enjoy their hospitality. It just so happens that I ate at Sodini's just two weeks after my recent dinner at Stino. When the owner saw me he gave me a hug, kissed both cheeks and told me it was good to see me. When I commented that it had been so long I couldn't believe he remembered me he responded that it had been a year, but he would never forget me.

Now that's the way you treat a long time customer. Augustino, take note. You're food is fantastic but that's not all there is to it."}
{"text":"Delicious italian food and clean place! Also great service! By the way, I always buy their tomato sauce from Giant Eagle or Heinen's."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. The fact that they don't take credit cards is no big deal compared to the deliciousness of their meals. I've probably eaten there 15 times and ALWAYS have great service. The staff at Stino never have even the slightest attitude. They appear genuinely happy to see you and help you and never annoyed or put out by a request. That is very rare.

the food. Oh, the food. Please go on a Thursday and get the special: beef tenderloin lightly breaded with romano cheese. Accompany it with pasta with Vesuvio sauce. then die happy. You can buy jars of the Vesuvio sauce at Heinen's (or at Stino) which is fantastic. We often get the sauteed calamari and it's perfectly cooked every time. Dipping the bread in the leftover white wine/lemon broth/sauce is recommended. (It's not breaded in case you are expecting a fried calamari.)

It's quite intimate as it's a smaller place. Finding parking isn't usually difficult. A dinner for 2 including appetizer, wine and dessert will be pretty costly, which is the reason I don't give Stino 5 stars. But this is absolutely worth the cost.  One of my only annoyances about Stino is that they don't open until later in the day (4pm, I think) to make a reservation, and they're closed on Sundays and Mondays.

A must try to for anyone looking for authentic and delicious Italian food."}
{"text":"My wife and I had an excellent meal there last Saturday, January 21.  I had the veal Saturday special and it was the best Italian dinner I have ever eaten.  My wife had lasagna which was also terrific!  We will be back.

Note:  No credit cards!  Have cash or write a check!

{"text":"I heard great things about this place, but somehow never made it there for years. I finally got my wife to take me for my birthday. I confirmed the rumors; Stino's serves great Italian food, simply prepared. But its more than dry pasta and bland marinara. Everything I tasted was definitely prepared with skill and fresh ingredients, flavorful and well seasoned. This is a great 
little special occasion joint. It's small, so a little noisy. They take reservations. Cash only, so be prepared."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night, the restaurant had customers already seated but was not what I would consider \"packed.\" We waited at the entrance to be seated but no one came to seat us. After walking into the dining area we were finally asked by the hostess/manager if we had reservations. We hadn't but she offered us either a table for 2, or to sit at the bar. Before waiting for a response she was gone to assist other customers at the entrance (where were you when we were waiting there?) She even asked us after we sat down if we would prefer sitting at the bar. It was obvious that we weren't welcome. 

The food was admittedly tasty, the veal was tender and the pasta sauce was delicious. I don't believe for one second that there's anything but tap water in those bottles though, why fake it?

The service was okay, but for the price I would have expected better. I guess if you're old and have been going there for years you'll get better service. 

I, like other reviewers, failed to notice the sign by the door that they only take cash or check. Why inconvenience your customers over a couple of dollars? 

Overall bad dining experience. Rocky River has many better options."}
{"text":"Best ever, food was wonderful, waiter Nathaniel was very very good at his job made us feel very welcome. Desserts were awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten my way around the great city of Cleveland and I have to say Stino is a good, solid choice but it's not my favorite Italian place.  And believe me, I wanted it to be.  It's a very cute and charming restaurant on Old Detroit Rd.  Service was attentive and very good.  I ordered the Gnocchi and my boyfriend got the Spaghetti with Bolognese.  The gnocchi was cooked perfectly.  The sauce was good, not great in my opinion.  Personally, I think Frickaccio's at West Side Market has a GREAT sauce (and gasp, their sauce is straight out of a can).  My boyfriend liked his Bolognese and said it's a tie with Nido Italia in Little Italy (his favorite Bolognese sauce).  Stino ONLY takes cash or checks so that caused a little delay in our dining experience."}
{"text":"The pasta was divine. The bartender was phenomenal. The ambiance was peaceful and perfect for a date. I'd go here again any day"}
{"text":"This is the perfect example of a local restaurant.  They don't advertise much.  They don't take credit cards, or checks - cash on the barrelhead only.  And they're still packed to the gills with locals any night you choose to name, because the food here is good, solid fare - top-notch without being flashy.  

The Italian food here is excellent, and the service is upscale without turning snobbish.  The highlights of the food we've had have been: 

* An excellent pasta carbonara, lightly cheesy and bacony without turning into the usual gummy, gut-pasting-together mess that most carbonara becomes; 

* A basil-and-tomato sauce pasta dish that featured delicious chunks of fresh mozarrella; the pasta itself wasn't the freshest I've ever had (it wasn't a dry Barilla brand from the supermarket, either), but the sauce was tangy and tasted of fresh tomatoes without being nothing more than chunks of tomatoes in a sauce.  

But the real charm here?  The desserts.  You wouldn't think it from an Italian restaurant, but you can bring the family here just for desserts and be entirely happy.  

They have - no kidding - THE best tiramisu I've ever had, where the ladyfingers had a sugary, crisp edge to them (yet were still moist) while the rum-and-cocoa filling made my tastebuds jangle.  

Get a rum cake?  The bottom is soaked in rum, without being overwhelming, a dense chocolately cake that's moist without being gummy.  And by God, if you get a lemon ice, it comes in a lemon, with little chunks of zesty lemon buried in the ice - so tart it makes your whole mouth ring with delight.  

Basically, this is the kind of place you discover, then bring your friends to because you feel like it's your place.  But really, when you look around the wealth of people clogging the tables on a Tuesday night, you realize... it's everyone's place."}
{"text":"I have been going here for the past 10 years at least, but have not written a review until now.  Stino has never disappointed me with either their food or service.  Was there tonight for the first time in a while.  My Shrimp Posippilo was fantastic.  Plump, tasty shrimp in an angle hair pasta with just the right amount of spice and sweetness to it.  My friend said his veal Marsala was the best he has had.  They have a small patio out front which I did not use, but looks like it could be fun on a pleasant night like this.  Don't waste your time and money on chains like Carabbas or God forbid Olive Garden.  Get yourself a real, authentic Italian meal, with great service and good drinks at Stino Da' Napoli."}
{"text":"I have two major qualifying criteria for an Italian restaurant - calamari and veal.

Not only do they have both, but they are done so well that Stino's is the basis by which I measure all other Italian dishes.  Oh, and they have some damn great sauces, too!

This cozy restaurant has been a longstanding respite of the otherwise bland italian offerings on the Westside of CLE.  Being located in the charming Old River Shopping area (located across the street from the Rocky River Heinen's) it is often over looked by most people, because they don't advertise and generally survive off of word-of-mouth and their sterling reputation.

Make sure you bring cash as they DO NOT ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS.  This is why I give them 4 stars instead of the 5 they deserve.  And, make a reservation as they are on the smaller side and tend to fill up most nights with lucky diners.

Aside from that small inconvenience if you're even remotely a fan of Italian cooking then this place is a must.  For the same price as that Americanized chain, \"Garden of Olea Europaea\", you can get something that will transport your taste buds to Napoli.

Oh, and if you haven't been in ages they now have wine available.

BONUS:  If you can't make it to the restaurant, but still want to enjoy their flavors you can pick up many of their sauces at reputable grocers like Heinen's."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about two years. 

What's not to love?"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Stino's since I was a very little child. They just celebrated their 19th anniversary: I believe and my family has been patronizing it almost as long. Augustino, the owner and store's namesake, and virtually the entire staff have come to recognize my grandparents by name. The former will occasionally abandon cooking to great them at the table. 
I have never been so consistently impressed with a restaurant, and I am very picky, especially in regard to service. 
I recommend the gnocchi with a bottle of Riesling. Both are excellent. Friends, seafood connoisseurs, drool over the tilapi and it's lemony preparation. 
I almost never get dessert, but can rarely resist Stino's lemon sorbet. Everything else, especially chocolate dishes and tiramasu, is a delight. 
Come here, eat here. It's a transcendental dining experience. **BUT they DON'T take credit cards!
Finally, I believe they just added a full bar."}
{"text":"Average Experience gone VERY VERY BAD!!

Horrible experience with customer service.  I'll start with the unfathomable.  5 diners order 4 desserts.  My mom is eating her Cake with Lemon Curd (don't believe it was on menu), she said it was pretty tasteless, I asked for a bite.   I take a forkful and see something GREEN in the filling.  I poked around at it, and it appeared to be MOLD.   So when the waiter comes by I say there is something GREEN in the cake that I'm sure is not supposed to be there.  He takes it away.  Doesn't apologize or ask if we would like something else.  I got to bathroom and while I am gone waiter comes back, offers no apology and states, the cake wasn't made in house and that was how it came to them.  Are you kidding me!!   He hands my dad the check and has not even taken the moldy cake off the bill.  Are you kidding me!!  My dad, being the overly nice guy that he is pays the bill.  When I find out later this happened I am totally appalled. 
Now to make it even worse, I encouraged my father to  email the restaurant and let them know about his horrible experience, he did and  after more than a week did not hear  back from anyone.  

So a supposedly nice restaurant serves moldy food, does not apologize, charges your for it and then doesn't even respond when brought to the attention of someone besides the waiter.  Decide for yourself if you want to eat here!!

Additional comments
* Everyone liked the pasta and veal, but it's not solely the food that makes a successful dinner or restaurant. 
* We were not welcomed or even acknowledged when we arrived for our reservation 
* Waiter acted like he was doing us a service by waiting on us
* Had to ask for bread...twice
* Four pasta entrees and they never came by to ask if we'd like any parmesan cheese, got tired of waiting to get attention of anyone, so ate without
* Very limited selection of appetizers all priced $14 + 
* Salad consisted of mix greens...that's it, my teenage son stated the salad at the retirement center was better, and he was right"}
{"text":"Nice local cozy spot in the heart of Rocky River.  Went on a Friday night and was seated promptly in the side room. It seemed the ac was not on since the thermostat read 78 a little hot for my likings. Now to the food. 

We started with the calamari  which from reading reviews  people seemed to like. When we placed the order our waiter also expressed to us that  these were not fried but came in a butter sauce.  I am not sure if the butter sauce is authentic  italian calamari but I was not the biggest  fan of this style. 

Here is where it got good we had the gnocchi  with meatballs. The gnocchi  were amazing and definitely fresh and hand made som top notch stuff here. The sauce on my gnocchi  was balanced  with great flavors loved it. 

Here is where it got better the other dish we had was the linguine with basil. This dish was bangin! There fresh basil in ever bite I could not keep my fork out of this dish and will be back for it!

We also had salads that were  just lettuce, carrots and a slice of tomato. Dressings were good raspberry and oil the other lemon and oil.

Very solid joint. Cash only"}
{"text":"I lived outside Cleveland for about a year, and this place was my absolute favorite.  Even now, 7 or 8 years later, I still dream of being able to go back to Stino.  I was pretty sure at that time it was a \"family\" business, since they only accepted cash, were closed on some of the busiest restaurant weeks of the year, and certain tables were reserved with plaques, but the food was so good I just had to set that aside.  There's a pasta dish with proscuitto that is incredible (maybe it has \"Columbus\" in the name?), and you have to order a slice of the ricotta cheesecake.  It's not like NY cheesecake-- better, lighter, not as sweet.  I'm still hunting for a recipe to make my own like that.  
Bottom line: go, GO!  And send me your leftovers!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, eat 'em up...

THE UP-SIDE:  I've always liked Stino Da Napoli.  The place is tiny, but maintains a cozy, pleasant, and high-end sorta vibe.  The food is excellent, they offer a nice wine selection, and the service is pleasant and efficient.

I recently returned to Stino for the first time in years for a date.  I ordered the Tilapia Alla Carrettiera and found it to be a tasty and wonderful selection.  The excellent food we shared, the cozy atmosphere, and the good wine really made for an excellent first date.

THE DOWN-SIDE:  The place is small (part of the charm) so you must make a reservation.  And remember, they do NOT accept credit cards.  However, they do accept personal checks.  

THE SUM-IT-UP:  Go here for a romantic date and to sample some excellent Italian food.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"While the location and service are great, the food is average.  Very surprised that the pasta was overlooked and soggy.  They seem to be resting on their reputation and local following vs pushing themselves to create a great dining experience.  Have tried it a few times now and will only return as a backup."}
{"text":"Went to Stino Da Napoli last Saturday night for dinner with my wife. We've been to Stino's serveral times and are / were fully aware of the Cash only policy, no credit cards are accepted. Parking and access are decent considering there are three other restaurants within a stone throw of each other. 

On the plus side we first like the decor, nice clean upscale look that does not go overboard. Our cocktails were well made and shared appetizer of Calamari was good. My opinion is that calamari is done well or it is poor - there is no ok. The selection of apps, pasta and veal is broad enough to please everyone, selecting a main course was tough due to several dishes discription sounding (reading) very tasty. Our main dishes were also very good, I had a nice veal dishes with peppers that was outstanding.

The few small issues with Stino's include the cash only policy, knowing in advance I stopped at the bank took out extra money to pay the bill. The noise level of the dinning room was a bit load, we often hard a hard time hearing each other talk. I guessing the noise level is a product of the hard wall surfaces and very close seating. Our service was very good and was happy to leave a nice tip 20% plus. I was a bit superised to see a server at an adjacent table handing dinner plates to the customers instead of walking around the table. 

I would be glad to return to Stino's again for dinner knowing that it is a cash only local and the dinning room could become a bit load, especially when seated very close to other dinners."}
{"text":"This place requires a bit of a drive if you're coming from the East Side - but it is well worth it! The owner and head chef is from Italy and incorporates classic Italian fare with his own unique style. Whether you get pasta, chicken, beef, or something else, you will never be disappointed in the creative and diverse culinary specialties that await you here."}
{"text":"If there is one cuisine I know, it's Italian.  This place came highly recommended, so we drove almost 45 minutes to try it out.  Flash forward--I'll save myself 20 minutes and just go to Mia Bella in Little Italy next time.
For some details now.  I do love little, \"hole-in-the-wall\" places, that's for sure. And while this doesn't really qualify for that because it's located on a really cool side street just over the bridge to Lakewood in Rocky River, it is really, really tiny.  I had to squeeze through seats to get up to use the restroom.  Our server barely had room to get to us to serve and clear our table.  Good think she was skinny.  I have to believe that must be a pre-requisite to work here.  I had visions of applicants being turned down for jobs, and the reason was \"sorry, you won't fit between our tables\".
But let's judge on the food and service, right?  Trying not to be bothered by sitting virtually on top of the neighboring tables, we ordered. 2 in our party ordered the gnocchi, which was supposed to be their signature dish.  I had spaghetti aglio oglio, and our 4th had some pasta with Neapolitan sauce, I forget the name.
The bread was tasty, crusty on the outside, soft inside, just the way I like it.  And the salad was very good, topped off with some homemade lemon-olive oil dressing.  Great for bread dipping.
My aglio oglio was good, but no better than what I make at home, so that was a bit disappointing.  
And the gnocchi...oh, the awful gnocchi...they were like mush.  Maybe it was an off night, but had I ordered them, I certainly would have sent them back.  Grandma made gnocchi, homemade, and they are supposed to be like potato dumplings.  Theirs were like little balls of mashed potato.  My wife and mom ate them anyway, but really didn't like them.  And dad said his Neapolitan sauce was \"good\".
Service was ok.  Our server really wasn't very attentive, didn't check back after delivering our entrees, which is probably why the gnocchi didn't get sent back.  Our dirty dishes lingered longer than I would have hoped, as well.
So is this the worst place ever?  No, of course not.  But will I go back?  No way.  Not when there are so many other great Italian joints in town.  I guess I'll never know if those gnocchi get any better..."}
{"text":"It is 2012, a beautiful restaurant in upscale Rocky River and the owner still doesn't accept credit cards! So bizarre. We dined here for the first timelast Saturday night, everything was fine until waitress advised us cash or check only when bill came. 

When we asked if there is an ATM nearby, she said we had to drive to one. Really? If you want to be that greedy and inconvenience your customers, the least you can do is ensure there is an ATM nearby. Waitress gave us a bit of an attitude stating there was a \"sign\" on the front door. Well, when we walked in, a couple who was walking in front of us had the door open so we missed that \"sign\".

Owner needs to advise servers to tell customers when they sit down about this ridiculous old fashioned policy.

Food and atmosphere were good but we were so turned off that we will never return. Going to Tartines next time!"}
{"text":"For nearly 20 years, we have had some of the best, most professional wait staff in town serve us here, and tonight is no exception. Cheers and kudos, Heidi, Stino, and all."}
{"text":"first and foremost they don't accept credit cards. We knew that from before and made sure our pockets were not empty.
It is situated in a nice part of rocky river. The interior is cozy. Service is good. Choices are plenty. 
For some reason I am drawn to make a comparison to 'peppers' in Lakewood where the service is far more friendlier. 
We ordered the gnocchi ala napoletana which was well cooked and tasty. It was served with fresh salad. The other two orders were petto di pollo alla Marsala and petto di pollo alla domiziano. I have eaten better chicken Marsala in olive garden. The two chicken dishes appeared similar in taste. The chocolate mousse was just good. 
We were seated immediately, but for a Wednesday it was quite busy.  Weren't really impressed with our choice except for the gnocchi. Would like to try other menu items before being too critical."}
{"text":"Have been here before so I know it's only cash. My meal was just very average. Chicken Marsala was not that good (very small portion covered with way more mushrooms than necessary. Salad was small and just lettuce with one slice of cucumber. We had a group of 8 and the waiter kept pouring wine into our glasses even as I was trying to take a sip from my glass, and then brought out more bottles without asking us.  I felt he was taking advantage of our group.  So each couple ended up with an average check of $180.  Lot of money for average food and wine.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The food, the wine-good. The service and cozy blankets on a chilly evening-awesome! I love their cozy outdoor dining area. We have gotten take out many times and are always happy."}
{"text":"Stino's is the BOMB. 
If you love seafood try the seafood Pescatore'. I have eaten here since it's opening around 15 or 16 years ago. I have pretty much tried everything on the menu. You cannot go wrong at Stino's."}
{"text":"My first time here. Amazing! Not huge portions but when the food is this good of quality and reasonably priced, no need. We loved it!"}
{"text":"It's just ok.  Lots of hype, been around a long time.  Pretty basic stuff, not bad, just not mind blowing.  Very expensive for what you get, not really worth it in my opinion.  We're likely not going back, not because it's terrible - just too expensive for ok food."}
{"text":"True Authentic Italian fare. Food is fantastic! I highly recommend the specials along with all the homemade desserts.


NOTE-This place is Cash Only! AND- Reservations, since it's a small quaint reestaurant."}
{"text":"Some of the best Veal in the city!  Don't worry, no police chiefs and mob bosses will be rubbed out here.  This is very very good Italian cooked perfectly.  This isn't the Americanized Italian where there is an over abundance of sauce and spices.  This is done the true Italian way.  Simple, fresh and everything singing in harmony.  The chef is a fantastic person as well!  Love this place and it has a great happy hour.  One of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland hands down.  I consider this a must go."}
{"text":"Great for take out! Good food to go at a great speed even while the restaurant was packed"}
{"text":"It had been a long time since I have been to Stino's and little had changed in terms of decor and I was disappointed to see they are still a cash only operation.  I am guessing they like keeping some of their sales under the table as adding 3% to cover credit card charges to a $20 meal is $0.60, which I am sure would not push away customers if they wanted to increase the prices to cover the cost.  That said, the menu had a lot of authentic Italian options and the food was good, but not great like Dante or Luca in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I rarely give out 5 star reviews but Stino Da Napoli has wrestled one out of me. 

Despite getting there half hour before they closed (they close early for a Saturday!), the service was not rushed. Our server was friendly and didn't show any signs of being inconvenienced. 

Our salads were dressed perfectly with olive oil and lemon juice. I tried a shrimp pasta dish with their red sauce. It was delicious. I tried a bite of my friend's gnocchi and briefly debated stealing her dish. The gnocchi was perfectly soft and pillowy. 

When I asked for extra bread, the server wasn't sure they had any left given they were almost closed. However, the kitchen found a few slices they had just put away and they warmed the bread up for us. The prices were fair. The ambiance was nice (maybe a touch kitschy). 

I do find it  a little strange that they don't take credit cards but their service/food more than makes up for it. I wish we had an Italian place like this where I live!"}
{"text":"We discovered Stino thanks to Yelp. Astounding the things that can be in your own back yard that you've simply overlooked!

Stino is a neighborhood Italian place, and it looks and feels like it. I consider that a very good thing. This place is friendly and cozy, and the service is helpful without being smothering. The quality of the food is very high, and the preparations are classic. The owners aren't taking a lot of chances, but they don't really have to in order to please their clientele. 

I have to admit that my favorite dish here is the Pasta Carbonara. Stino makes the best \"heart attack on a plate\" I've ever eaten. In fact, I can't come here very often, because I can't resist the carbonara and my family wants me to live for a few more years.

The restaurant doesn't take credit cards, so be ready to fork over cash. The wine list treats wine like an accompaniment to good food rather than an end of its own. The dessert case empties quickly on weekend evenings, so if you are there late, you probably aren't going to get the tiramisu. But if you're looking for friendly, classic Italian on the West Side, this is your place."}
{"text":"I have never had Italian like this before!  The food was nothing less than amazing.  Perfect service.  The owner is amazing!  Stino sat us, followed up, and really took care of us.  This place is 6 stars not 5!!"}
{"text":"I would say our overall experience here was average. I was impressed with the atmosphere and the Italian wait staff, but the food was nothing special. We started with the meatball sliders that came out in less than 3 minutes, which showed in the taste. Our entrees were much better. Overall, we were there for 45 minutes after ordering 2 drinks, an appetizer, and 2 entrees. For a $130 bill I expect a longer and higher quality experience."}
{"text":"Honestly, who are these people with the bad reviews! This was by far the best Italian I have ever eaten! My gosh, the owners go out of their way to welcome you! Wonderful food, exceptional service, really can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had linguine with clam sauce and the sauce had no clams in it. Just marinara garnish with a couple of clam shells. That, and the seafood made me extremely ill afterword. Lastly, they only take cash or check...yup a written check. I need more good Italian food in my life, and this wasn't it."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yummy!  Gnocchi is the absolute best!  Meatballs were very flavorful.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"I've had good Italian in Chicago, but this is fantastic Italian in Cleveland. It's so fantastic! The venue is pretty large and so are the portions. Definitely suggest trying it out,"}
{"text":"Stino's is one of my favorite places for Italian food. They have a wide selection of Italian food, from pastas to chicken dishes. Their sauce is probably some of the best in the region. Personally, my favorite is the spaghetti carbonara. The bread is amazing, I usually order extra.  I'm not a big fan of their salads, but they're still very good. The service is always nice and courteous. The restaurant itself looks very fancy and is a great place to go to for a special occasion. 

Bottom line, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"simple place, been in this location for years. food is basic homestyle italian fare, nothing fancy or ellaborate........had the lasagna - very good, pure and simple. loved the tomato/marinara sauce. the calamari appetizer was just ok, nothing great, neither is the lemon & olive oil dressing on the dull and uninspired salad.....this place is good, for what it is. a good place for the senior crowd. liked what i ate, but not enough that it remains on my radar or list of \"must return to places\".  this restaurant only accepts cash and checks (checks, really?) but NO credit cards."}
{"text":"Mom was craving italian so we came across Stino's. Atmosphere is nice. They only take cash or check which wasn't a problem for me as I always carry but my mom does not. The server was very nice. I got a chardonnay and my mom got the basil martini. The martini was quite yummy. Mom ordered the veal medallions. I got the gnocci. Both came with an extremely disappointing side salad. Just lettuce, carrots and one cherry tomato. The lemon dressing was tasty. The rolls they served literally say \"orlando rolls\" on the menu. Seems a bit cheesy to serve such boring rolls that you can buy at the grocery store at such a nice place. Entrees arrived. My gnocci was over cooked, kinda soggy. Boring sauce and cheese. Nothing special. Could of made it better at home. Mom's veal was good but it was small and didn't come with anything! 3 small medallions and that boring salad for $28? We skipped dessert. With tip the bill came to $105. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic remodel since the last time we were there! Server, fantastic! Wine list, excellent!

For those who complaint about not being told about not accepting credit, they DO tell you upon making a needed reservation. 

Pricing is fair for entree's. Pricing for a glass of wine a bit high. The main issue I have heard and finally had, the lack of appetizers! Not many on the menu. And the ones on there, are highly priced, close to some entree pricing. Needs updated!

There are far too many Veal options. Put Eggplant on as a daily or even a weekend option! (Opinion).

Deserts, AWESOME!

Will be back!"}
{"text":"If there is a better Italian restaurant in Cleveland, I need to find it. The best eggplant parmigiana anywhere hands down. Served Friday only and worth the wait. All dishes are light, tasty and prepared perfectly for an enjoyable evening. Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Meet Augustino from Naples.  He is very friendly.  He is one helluva chef.  

Try the Spaghetti Al Fumo Del Vesuvio.  Delicioso!  Tomato based sauce with cream, smoked bacon, onions.  We have pined for this sauce since moving away from the west side of Cleveland.

Try the Petto Di Pollo Alla Milanese.  Outstanding!  Very lightly breaded, nice lemony flavor.

Even the house salad here is great-fresh lettuce and greens with the house dressing-just EVOO, sea salt, fresh pepper, a squeeze of fresh lemon-very basic and true to italian tradition.  As a matter of fact, we probably tried just about everything on the menu and loved it all.

I could go on, we lived close enough that we picked up take-out probably once a week for over a year.  Once he gets to know you, Stino has been known to ply those waiting for take out orders with italian coffee.  Very nice, better drive home before the coffee hits you.  Probably shouldn't have had that on an empty stomach.

Everything we tried here is great quality and wonderfully flavorful and we miss Augostino and his food terribly."}
{"text":"Whats not to LOVE!! The food is simply delicious, we love the bar, wonderful Martinis, the most fabulous desserts, the staff is great, Love Love Love Stino's, this is our go to place, its delicious."}
{"text":"THE FOOD;  This is a small restaurant done right.  The menu is simple and elegant.  The small menu includes several different pastas and a few salads and appetizers as well as veal, chicken breast and tillapia dishes.  There are a few, very well executed preparations.  This insures that the ingredients are very fresh and that the chef has given the requisite attention to the preparation.

I had one of the three veal medallion preparations-- the classic veal marsala.  The fresh mushrooms were sllced paper thin atop tender, succulent  veal.  The marsala sauce was appropriately thin, subtley sweet and savory.  I must admit to tossing small slices of bread in my sauce to sop it up.  Purrrrrr.  

My companion's tillapia was surprisingly delish.  I don't like tillapia.  It is generally mushy and bland.  Whatever discernable flavors it has are wholly unimpressive. This fish was again, exceedingly fresh, perfectly cooked and flavorful.  The entree was topped with a fresh (not stewed) tomato and basil sauce.  Num.  

Our appetizer--an artfully arrainged version of ensalata Caprezzi (buffalo moz, tomatoes, basil and olive oil) was very fresh,  The basil was unusually fantastic.  Really-- it stood out.  The salads were simple and fresh-- the vegetables looked as if they had been picked and chopped seconds before.

The tiramisu was the best I've ever had.  And I've had a lot of tiramisu in my day-- which may explain some things.  It was creamy and not at all gritty.  The coffee flavors were bright, but subtle.  

ATMOSPHERE:  Cozy.  It defines an intimate Italian restaurant, although it was a bit bright.

SERVICE:  The wait staff is absolutely charming-- friendly withut being overly so.  Our server was pleasant, genuine and candid.

WINE:  Good selection.

NB:  They accept only cash and personal check.  This is bizzare considering that gumball machines in Rocky River take plastic.  It is tiny and popular, so make reservations."}
{"text":"I wasn't so sure about this place when we 1st sat down. But the service was outstanding and the waiter helped us through the menu. Because we had never been there before I played it safe and went with the lasagna. My wife got the eggplant parmesan. When I took my 1st bite I knew this was something special! When my wife tasted the eggplant parmesan she felt the same way. 

Even though we normally don't choose to have dessert, after our experience with the main courses we were excited to try the desert.  They all looked really good, but once again I played it safe and got the tiramisu.  We were again blown away. I am not a big  tiramisu fan, But once again this was something very special. To better describe it I would say that everything tasted fresh and homemade. The red sauce had a bright fresh, rich tangy flavor, unlike anything I've ever tasted out of a jar, or in a restaurant. 

We spoke to Stino, who is the owner and the Chef, and his wife and son. Very fine people. He and his wife have been in the restaurant business for 27 years... since he left Naples Italy. They gave us a tour of the kitchen...immaculate.

Since we live 2 hours away we have to figure out how to get back there again soon. A great experience!"}
{"text":"The building is Beautiful and the food is good. They do not accept Apple Pay or even physical credit cards. I asked for extra sauce on the take out and they wanted to charge me $5 for a small cup. Absolutely insane."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I have been, but both times were excellent. Reservations definitely necessary as this place is extremely popular. the menu is fairly extensive and our only disappointment was with our appetizer.

We specifically asked for our calamari to be crisp and when it came out the waiter told us \"they don't do it that way\". Had I known I wouldn't have ordered - skipped it the next time.

All in all, a good experience and well worth a try."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Italian. The house red wine was outstanding, the lemon oil dressing on the salad was light and refreshing and all of our entrees were great. Can't wait to return and try more dishes. The chef came out and talked to us about selecting the grapes for the wine himself in Italy. Go to Rosso Gelato for dessert for a perfect Italian night (though the dessert at Stino looks outstanding)"}
