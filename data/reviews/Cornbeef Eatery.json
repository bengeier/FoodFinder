{"text":"Came here with my friends and the corned beef is Delicious!!! Service is great as well.. i will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Scottsdale.. wish they had one in cali"}
{"text":"Large portions and the food was tasty! I personally had the Tuna melt with the sweet potato fries and it did not disappoint. The only negative is the drink situation - seemed a bit high to pay $2.50 for a bottle of water but had no other option. In the future, I'd bring my own in. The owner was extremely kind and welcoming!"}
{"text":"We ordered Janies Dream with waffle fries and they were delicious! I wish we had taken a picture because the size of the sandwich was huge. We also had the peach cobbler which was fresh, warm, and a large portion even for two people. Peach cobbler is a favorite of mine and this was one of the best ones I've had. Customer service was great. Rick and Mike are awesome. We definitely recommend everyone to stop by and try the Cornbeef Eatery. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich. Had the Janies dream. Food was amazing and very friendly service.  I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Not a big corn beef fan, but after eating here my mind has changed. It was one of the best sandwiches I have had in a long time and I will definitely be visiting again to eat here."}
{"text":"Happened to stop in while shopping in the area. Amazing service and delicious food- definitely recommend the Janies Dream and waffle fries!"}
{"text":"Our friends just posted that they were here and it was great,  so we came down to try it and it did not disappoint!  That was definitely the best sandwich I've had in a while!  The owners(I'm assuming) were so nice to us as well. We tried the carrot cake cheese cake and it wad out of this world!"}
{"text":"They several fabulous sandwiches made to order. The sweet potato fries are tasty, crisp and perfect. Nice option to sit outside and eat. Rick and his assistant provided lovely service."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Rick the owner will take care of you. I ordered Janies dream and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is dirty. The food is overpriced. The wait time is very very long for deep fried potatoes I don't see why that take so long. Looks like the guy might need more help than just by himself. Using getting much better meal at the food court at Fashion Square Mall. My meat was an odd color but I was really hungry so I ate it anyways and goodness gracious that I pay for that. Food poisoning all night long until the next day. I hope that this is a warning to anyone decides to take it Overlook at this place. No good. Bad meat. And the place just looks cheap. They found sodas so they want you to pay $3 for a little tiny soda? This place is way overpriced and disgusting. The food will make you sick. Stay away"}
{"text":"Hey cornbeef  eatery is easy in and easy out fresh sandwiches. Local sourced cheesecakes and meat. Good service and very reasonable prices. Thanks"}
{"text":"This was the best pastrami sandwich I have had in years.  Honestly, I know good pastrami and corn beef and this place delivers. Need lunch in old town you have to give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is really great,  food is amazing and the owner Rick is super nice! Don't walk by this place, you'll regret it!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in UberEats order .   Bread was  very soggy and did not take my request for a different bread . Saw other pictures with pickles - did not add pickles when requested . Do not care for sweet potato fries and sandwich came with that ( no options for regular fries )   Corn beef did taste good thou ! Just huge disappointment for about $40 lunch for two - order was late as well .   Hopefully this place is better in person ! Would not recommend ordering delivery- ( bread really can't handle traveling well )"}
{"text":"If you're looking for tender cornedbeef, this is the place to go. I've been to several cornedbeef restaurants across the valley and unfortunately it's more miss than hit where you'll find yourself paying for a typically expensive sandwich stacked with tough odd flavored meat. Definitely not the case here. As other reviewers have stated, Rick's cornedbeef seriously melts in your mouth. You can tell very quickly Rick puts a ton of passion and care into every sandwich and genuinely cares about your experience. Great chance to get a fantastic Detroit cornedbeef sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Great food! The owner even took the time to hear all my wife's dietary restrictions and made her something off menu and fantastic. We'll be back for sure... great find in old town."}
{"text":"Excellent East Coast style sandwiches and friendly staff. Definitely a welcomed addition to Old Town."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC SANDWICH, Made with love! Come visit Rick!   Great cornbread, huge portions for the price, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Sandwiches were fantastic and service was great. Would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"A bare bones sandwich shop run by a really nice guy from Detroit. The food was good but it took a really looooooong time to make four sandwiches.  The sweet potato fries and waffle fries were good accompaniments to the corned beef.  Many other reviewers commented on the large size of the sandwich.  I didn't think it was all that big.  At least on mine, most of the meat was in the center and not much on the ends. If you want something to wash down your sandwich be prepared to spend $2.50 for a bottle of water or soda. There are no fountain drinks or free cups of water.  Beverages added $10 to our tab.  I thought $71 was awfully expensive for four sandwiches, sides and soda.  Granted, it's Scottsdale but it's a small storefront with metal tables."}
{"text":"Best corned beef I've ever had. Portions are HUGE--Rick definitely doesn't skimp on the meat!  All sandwiches include fries (also awesome) and a delicious pickle. Everything is made fresh. Truly a find!!"}
{"text":"Awesome little sandwich shop! My boyfriend and I saw it one time and promised we would come back and try it. The owner was super awesome and very friendly. Cornbeef was fantastic. I will definently come back. I work right around the corner so I can always walk here with my coworkers."}
{"text":"Monster pastrami sandwich, Reuben sandwiches! We had a great, super-fresh salad with mixed greens local food and avocado. The grilled chicken was very good and Rick the owner is very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Amazing food, clean restaurant, and welcoming environment! I will definitely be back here many times in the future. The owner is very kind and works hard to deliver delicious sandwiches quickly. Had the focaccia panini with cornbeef, pickled cabbage, gruyere cheese and Russian dressing on the side. It came with waffle fries and all was great! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Honestly the best sandwich spot in Old Town. Not only is the food absolutely amazing but the owner Rick is the sweetest, most charming man ever. Highly recommend you visit this spot!"}
{"text":"This is a relatively new sandwich shop in Old Town.  The decor is pretty basic and you order at the counter.    They have a big menu of corned beef sandwiches and I ordered Janie's Dream which came with corned beef and pastrami.  The meat itself was very good.  It wasn't quite piled high like a NY style deli but still substantial.  The fresh made waffle fries were awesome.  The one real negative was the prices they charged me at the register were higher than those printed on the menu.  They charged me $13.50 for the sandwich that was $12.62 on the menu and $2.41 for the Coke that was $2.25 on the menu.  Tax was added on top of the prices.  Speaking of the menu, if you are bored, see how many misspellings you can find.  I found five. \"panni\" instead of \"panini\", \"romain\" instead of \"romaine\", \"potatoe\" instead of \"potato\", \"deserts\" instead of \"desserts\" and \"fry's\" instead of \"fries\"."}
{"text":"Pure Happiness for your tastebuds.  The meat was so tender and juicy and perfectly paired with a delicious strawberry, walnut and avocado salad.  Yummy Yummy!!! Will definitely be returning soon for round 2"}
{"text":"OMG IS ALL I Can Say!!! Oh Taste And See... you will Love the food at this eatery!!! I had the Tuna Melt and the Sweet potato fries. It was perfectly seasoned and the tuna was the best. The service is great and Rick is very personable. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the 7 mile Rd sandwich that costs $15.84. I ordered via uber eats so the total for delivery and tip came to $28.32 . For a sandwich .  I'm making this review based on the $15.85 for the sandwich alone , to be fair .    If I were to make this sandwich in my kitchen I would be happy with it . But for $16 it should be huge and delicious falling apart with pastrami and sauerkraut. It was not . It was just an average size sandwich and average taste . I could have gotten this off the market fresh sandwich menu at Arby's for $6.   If you're going to have the balls to sell a $16 deli meat sandwich , the quality and quantity should reflect that . This sandwich was not worth the dough"}
{"text":"Oh my God this is the best cornbeef I had this side of the Mississippi. The service is impeccable absolutely the most tender cornbeef I ever had it melts in your mouth you have to visit this place it's incredible!!"}
{"text":"I stopped here and had the Corned Beef and Pastrami on Onion Roll. Rick, the owner, made fresh waffle fries for me. The sandwich was remarkable light, and most flavorful. The fries were hot and delectable. Rick is an awesome and welcoming guy. Try this place...I will return."}
{"text":"We actually tried to go to FnB for dinner because they had a patio and we had the dogs with us but we got a bit of a snooty Scottsdalian vibe there when I tried to get a table. In the end the server said the patio was closed because it would be too cold to eat outside and somehow I didn't think they would buy that my chihuahua mix was a service dog (Nor Tricki our spastic papillon) ;). Too cold at 4-5 pm while it was still tank top weather in the prime month of March during a popular holiday weekend and we are customers wanting to give them our business? Well they certainly lost out on profits from us! I actually did say well that's a shame because you lost out on our business but they didn't really seem to care that much. Oh well, on to better things!  We were actually going to go back near home to eat but saw the cheery orange \"Cornbeef\" sign walking back and spied the selection of nice tables outside. While browsing through the menu posted on the window the owner came by and mentioned their St. Patrick's Day special: corned beef, cabbage, red potatoes and carrots for $14. Sign me up!  It only took a few minutes to make the corned beef special and the AZ Special sandwich with sweet potato fries. The assistant/server came outside to deliver our meals and was so nice and sweet. She spent a bit of time showering attention to the dogs and gave them a few treats :)   She warned that the corned beef special was huge and she was right but I had a mighty appetite that day! All the veggies tasted great and there was plenty of corned beef which was well seasoned. It did get a bit salty for me towards the end of the meal but hey it's corned beef, it is going to be salty from the brine. Having all the veggies did disperse some of the natural salty flavor from the meat. The veggies themselves were cooked well. My favorite of the three was the soft wedge of cabbage which had soaked up some of the corned beef flavor. So good!   Seating outside was spacious and plentiful. By the time we finished it was still warm and pleasant (Contrary to FnB's opinion), perfect weather for walking around.   Everyone here is so genuinely nice (Versus some other shops where you get the \"I'm being nice to you because they are paying me to be nice\" vibe). They are truly a breath of fresh air in old town Scottsdale and make this area a better place. So I will extend some thanks to FnB for refusing to seat us because we discovered this little gem of a shop! If Vivian from Pretty Woman were in this situation she would go into FnB while waving bags and bags of Cornbeef sandwiches in front of them saying, \"Big Mistake. Big. Huge!\"  (Edited the wording in this review based on additional info- there is one sole owner and assistant vs. two co-owners)"}
{"text":"I got Mike's and it was unreal.  Great pastrami and the cornbeef was as good as I've had here in AZ.   If you're in oldtown, it is well worth a stop in for lunch or whenever."}
{"text":"This place has a great environment and delicious food. I got the Focaccia Rueben (Panni Press) which was delicious and a big portion size for the price! The food is made right in front of you! I will definitely be coming back here again because this food made me feel good. My girlfriend and I got fast, friendly service with a smile. I can't wait to come back to this restaurant for the better made chips and faygo pops (Michiganders know what I'm talking about!) I liked this place the most because it's perfect for eating on the go while shopping around old town."}
{"text":"We ordered Turkey Reuben and corned beef and pastrami.   The sandwiches were piled high with the real deal corned beef and pastrami.  Sweet potato fries were awesome.  Just like we were in a NY deli."}
{"text":"Excellent. Best Reuben I've ever had at a restaurant. Period. Great service, friendly people. That's what matters. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably good! Sandwich is rich with flavor, environment is welcoming, and the owner, Rick, is a remarkable human being. 7/5 stars for Cornbeef Eatery. Try it!"}
{"text":"The fancy places were not open despite what websites suggested. We peaked in the door of this terrific little Detroit style sandwich shop, heard some funky music, and smelled the pastrami.  If you're interested in genuinely good corned beef, pastrami, chicken or turkey sandwiches, Reuben's, tasty fries, and things like that, you're in for a treat. We will come back. And if you're from Detroit, you'll recognize the real deal. They are even getting Faygo's soon."}
{"text":"Food was great, quick service, and overall was worth 5 stars other than the price/value aspect. Some of the best corned beef and pastrami I've had and the bread was like it was baked that same day. The sides are a little limited but the fries were hot & crispy and a reasonable portion. The two guys working were friendly, helpful, and I was most impressed that they seemed to take pride in their work. There aren't a lot of places that will ask how you liked the sandwich with genuine interest.  Now the price question $20+ for lunch is a bit high, even for Old Town Scottsdale. The sandwich was good, not sure if it was $20 good (with a drink). Most of the sandwiches were $12-16 so throwing in a side and a beverage runs up the tab.  I'd eat there again based on the food and service, the value part would make me think twice about my options."}
{"text":"We had a very singular experience. We were walking past and tried to go in, but they are closed on Sundays. The owner was walking by and opened up to serve us. Amazing corned beef by the way, but even better service!"}
{"text":"First off, the food is delicious. No complaints about the food taste. Couldn't give five stars because of two reasons.   Cornbeef Eatery is expensive. $12 for a turkey rueben & water is lil high.   No fountain drinks. Which also means no just cups of water. Didn't want to pay $2.50 for a bottle of soda or water but had no other option."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Wednesday after shopping with my neighbor. The food was delicious. I had a Rubin and she had pastrami. The meats were tender and juicy and the staff very friendly. Great customer service. I am adding it to my list if go too's."}
