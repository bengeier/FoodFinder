{"text":"Ate here on our last night in Montreal, wish i had tried it sooner! Ate a few other places including one of the more hyped up spots in the area, which came in slightly under expectations. Bocata was amazing! The food was delicious, the ambience was spot on, music selection was great! ... but let me get to the food.... 

Had the fried smelt, first time trying this, were delicious, perfecr with the spritz of lemon and then a mayo dip, could have had more! Hubby had the oyster special and loved them. 

The octopus a gallega was tender, and wonderful. But the highlight for me was the squid ink risotto... EAT THIS ... i could have eaten this for every dinner... it was rich and delicious, with a little smokiness from the spicy chorizo, tender little baby squid tentacles, peas, and baby cilantro sprinkled on top. The prawn and scallop served on top were cooked to perfection! Get this, you wont be disappointed!!!! 

The only downside here was that they were out of the crispy chicken skins for the night, which i was dying to try, but they must be good if they ran out! 

5 stars, will recommend to anyone who takes the trip out to mtl. Oh, and make a reservation in advance, and if you cant, download the DINR app to score last minute reservationa from cancellations if you cant find something!"}
{"text":"The food is creative and well prepared, the ambience is lovely, the wine list impressive. However, it seems like they haven't really decided if they are a tapas bar or not."}
{"text":"One word.....AMAZING!!!! This place far exceeded expectations.  To start, the waitstaff was incredible, courteous, attentive, and knowledgable of the5 menu and wine list.  For 2 of us,  We started with the 60g cheese course, paired with chenin blanc.  All locally sourced cheeses and enough that we could each have a satiable portion and truly  enjoy each cheese.  They offer wines by the half and whole glaseses, so you can easily pair wines with your course selection. From there, we moved on to the braised leeks with truffle and duck confit with arugula.  Both were out of this world, wonderfully balanced, and again perfectly portioned. The waitress brought us multiple samples of wines to taste to find the perfect pairing.  For entrees, we had the half lobster,and the veal with manchego. Both beautifully cooked and presented.   This was one of the best restaurants, meals,culinary experience ive had in a long time. I would highly recommend to anyone eating out in montreal."}
{"text":"Truly outstanding meal.

After a 5 year hiatus, I returned to Montreal looking for some great meals and Bocata was an unexpected surprise hit.  The environment was homely and romantic.  Both my wife (a fish lover) and I (a meat lover) enjoyed the food thoroughly.  

We also recommend Le Club Chasse et Peche and Au Pied de Cochon but found Chez l'Ã‰picier to be past its prime."}
{"text":"Disappointed by this restaurant's limited menu and wine list. 

Food options are restricted to a short list of non appealing  choices. 

The wine list is overpriced for the quality of wines being offered. Many choices but none of them are actually good. The minimum you will spend on a bottle of wine is 50$ which is completely unjustified for the choices being offered. Need to change the sommelier ASAP !!! 

Food wise, I ordered the Duck and arugula ( was good but nothing spectacular ) and the Bourguignon Braised Flatiron ( delicious but too small a portion) and finished off with the chocolate brownie (too sweet and  nothing to rave about ). My wife had the small fish plate as an appetizer and the Sea Bass as a main course. Her appetizer had more fish in it for 4$ than her 17$ main... Really ??? 

Even if the decor, service and ambiance are nice, this place is overhyped and you could easily get a better value for your dollar elsewhere . 

Definitely not worth a return visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here. Bocata has a very cozy and warm atmosphere and the staff is friendly and helpful. We started off with \"small bites\"--oysters (salty, fresh), stuffed peppers, and sea smelts. Everything was very tasty and fresh. For my main, I had the veal chop which was really juicy and the potato gnocchi was perfect. My husband had the sea bass which he also enjoyed. We would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Awesome food
Great ambience
Attentive service

The main course took longer that it should've for such an exclusive restaurant with limited seating
They world be well served by doing away with a couple of 2 sweater tables. I could've as much been a part of the conversation and meal of the adjoining table as I was my own"}
{"text":"My wife and I had an outstanding time at Bocata. Their service was spot on and we ended up having the last bottle of one of the wines they served. Our waitress recommended the special orzo risotto with shaved white truffles. My wife had the lobster carbonara, which I ate after she got her first bite of my white truffles. You have to keep the wife happy!  If you are looking for an outstanding meal with staff that treats you like family this is the place. Thank You!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently spent 2 nights in Montreal and our experience at Bocata was certainly one of the highlights. Bocata is located on an adorable side street in Old Montreal with a European feel. We arrived around 5 PM before the dinner crowd and were seated immediately by the window. Truly it felt like we had the little restaurant to ourselves. The decor is rustic-eclectic and the music was unexpected alternative rock which I love (as I stepped into the restaurant The Pixies were playing!!). The music volume was just right and did not at all interfere with intimate conversation. Our 2 female servers were incredibly nice and took the time to chat with us and answer some questions we had. We mainly ordered some small plates and drinks which were freshly prepared and delicious. We ordered the cheese plate, sea smelts with aioli (just like I've had in Spain!), and Pata Negra de Bellota (the absolute best quality Spanish jamon iberico-expensive but worth it). If you plan to go later around dinner time then reservations are a must as the restaurant is very popular and fills up quickly. The menu options are limited but for good reason- the food is prepared fresh with the highest quality ingredients and done well. It is expensive,yes, but this is typical of the area as you are paying for the wonderful ambience and experience as well as the delicious food."}
{"text":"THE BEST LOBSTER ROLL I EVER HAD.

The service was outstanding. For starters, we (a party of four) did not have a reservation. However we were accommodated by being seated immediately at the bar. As we deliberated over the drinks, Mitch shared his in depth expertise regarding the wine selection and more. The entire staff was friendly. Furthermore the music and ambience was matchless. Next time we visit Montreal the plan is to patronize Bocata daily.

{"text":"Great food!!! A bit pricey and small portions, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"\"Omg!!\" I believe those were our exact words after our first bite of the Bone Marrow! We stumbled upon this place while walking around Old Montreal and couldn't be happier. The hostess made room for us even though we didn't have a reservation and was extremely inviting. We ordered the bone marrow, beef carpaccio, and the octopus. The bone marrow was insanely good!!!! So good in fact that every time we eat marrow we will now have to compare it to their version. I would definitely order the beef carpaccio again but unfortunately I cannot say the same about the octopus. The plate was a little too bland but given the quality of the other dishes and cocktails we would eat here again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Cozy, fun atmosphere. Fish of the day (tuna) was incredibly fresh and seasoned perfectly. Oysters are delicious. Portions are perfect for saving room for desert. We had little Italian donuts dipped in dulce de lece and a lemon meringue pastry. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"I eat at Bocata every time I visit Montreal. Bocata pushes my limits and makes me want to try things I normally wouldn't think would work well together. Whether it's a drink or an entree, they serve up complex flavors and elegance while also managing to make you feel like you're having comfort food in your cozy yet stylish dining room. I'm going back this weekend and I can't wait!"}
{"text":"On our recent trip to Montreal, we ate A LOT, this was the only place we went back to twice. 

The setting: very cool, its small, but you sort of feel like you're in an old European castle. one mild night we sat at the windows which open directly to the sidewalk, its on a quiet little street & was very nice. the dim/dark lighting adds to the ambiance. 

The food & drinks: we started with a combo of charcuterie & cheese, really good! our favorite item on the menu was the veal & manchego, the veal was cooked perfectly, the cheese was melty & it had a hint of something sweet, really good. we also did the short ribs, foie gras & a few specials. they had a nice selection of wines by the glass. the chocolate bread pudding with caramelized bananas & caramel was phenomenal!!!

final thoughts: the service was great, if you're really hungry you'll have to order a bunch of small plates as the portions are small, but i highly recommend this place for date night."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here with a few friends.  It was a last minute decision at 6 pm on the day of and we called and were able to get a reservation for 9.30 pm.

As others have said, it is a very small space, but can be considered cozy and on a very cold night in Montreal a perfect place to grab some tapas.  The plates are really good, especially the chorizo grilled cheese, which we had 5 of them.  Also, the grouper was really really good.  However, my only complaint is that for the price you should get a little bit more than what is provided.

So if you are hungry, order a lot of plates.  

The service was very attentive and not too intrusive.

I wanted to try the lobster and short ribs, but alas they were out by the time we were there...looks like I need to go back."}
{"text":"Great service, had the duck confit salad, veal chop, and the sea bass.  Definitely would come back for all of the above!  Even the bread they give you before dinner was amazing!  Great little gem!"}
{"text":"My husband, our young son (in baby stroller) and I got a seat within seconds on a Saturday night without any reservation. The waitress was awesome! Great recommendations in terms of foods and wines. The lobster carbonara tagliatelle which I ordered was soooooo good!! The sea smelts were simply delicious!! Other that the foods, musics (60s) were great too!! 
Bottom line - next trip to Montreal, this will be THE place for us to visit again!!

{"text":"Stumbled on this restaurant with my boyfriend for our anniversary dinner and we absolutely LOVED it. The best ambience of any restaurant I've ever been to. It's beautiful inside; super cozy, candles everywhere, almost like a cellar with pretty windows looking outside. Everything was presented beautifully (eg their wine list is taped to the pages of old books, and we had a nice basket of fresh homemade bread while waiting for our food). I don't know why everyone is complaining about the wine; it's a WINE BAR, so obviously tons of the choices are expensive wines imported from Europe etc., but they also have wines by the glass that are less expensive and still wonderful. The food was absolutely amazing. Yes, a bit pricey, but we thought it was very much worth the price for a special occasion (and we're broke students, so I think we're pretty reliable when it comes to value for our money). The portions are small (which our waiter warned us about) because of the tapas style restaurant but I honestly don't know how people say they left here hungry; I order the tomato soup (great) and the lobster gnocchi (amazing) and couldn't finish the second dish because it's all so rich! Sometimes it's not about the big portions but the quality of the food. We also got the brownie with salted caramel and blood orange sorbet and found it unbelievable as well. And, most importantly, SO UNPRETENTIOUS! So many restaurants in old montreal tend to look down on students (we spend money sometimes too, however rarely) but we were treated so well and seated promptly even without reservations. Overall really great experience as long as you know what you're getting and don't expect it to be something it's not. Would recommend this forever (clearly!)"}
{"text":"A big disappointment. It  is a cute restaurant and the waitress was sweet even if she asked me if I \"was still working\" on my food and asked me twice if everything was ok. The  wine pour really annoyed me. Very little wine in the glass and when I complained she explained that all the pours are measured out. The menu was very limited and my  pork  entree was too salty.  My husband's fish was pretty good, but we came away with an overall \"mediocre\" impression of this establishment. I would not return."}
{"text":"Oh my!!!! Amazing from beginning to end. First off, wonderful service and very friendly staff. You can order appetizers by the piece. This way you get a wide variety. The oysters are a must, plump, briny and juicy. The octopus salad was my favorite. It's smokey like sausage. There's a variety of main courses. Again, something for everyone. Good music too. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal meal. Came with a group of friends during Grand Prix weekend. The owner made us feel like kings -- lobster, steak, appetizers, great wine selections. Steak perfectly cooked, lobster sweet and tender, even the mashed potatoes were dynamite. The owner made sure we were taken care of at every moment. He even had a drink with us. Cannot speak highly enough of the time we had here."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, very lively but not too loud, after the Canadian GP.  The grill outside smelled delicious and the meats looked nice, but I chose the lobster carbonara. It was excellent!"}
{"text":"Had a truly wonderful meal here, though a few things must be mentioned. They seem to have 2 main seatings for dinner, which means that you either eat a little earlier or later than you might wish. Our choices were 6:30 or 9:30. On the positive side, they did not rush us in any way, so we were able to spend a leisurely 2.5 hours over dinner, which was nice. 

The wine choices are extensive, and although we weren't familiar with the bottles they had, they were very knowledgeable and our server (possibly the owner?) seemed to really be interested in finding something that we would enjoy in our price range. In the end we were happy with the selection, but make no mistake: wine here is not cheap. If you go by the glass they have two sizes: small and smaller (2.5 and 5 oz glasses, which will run you about $7-9 for the small and $11-14 for the larger.  It's definitely worth getting a bottle.

The plates, served tapas style, are truly small, and are definitely pricier than what you would expect from tapas restaurants, but saying that, everything we had was fantastic.  We had the iberian ham over garlicky bread (outstanding in taste but a very small portion), cured salmon (better size and equally tasty), mountain and sea (lobster meat set atop possibly the best short ribs I have ever tasted), seared scallops with red cabbage (gorgeous)  and the chocolate bread pudding with Carmel sauce (I was depressed when the plate was empty!!). These five dishes were enough for two of us; we were pleasantly full but not stuffed. Hungry diners might need another dish or two. 

Atmosphere was very cosy and romantic, and there were a mixture of couples and parties of six or so.  Service was efficient but not intrusive. 

I would definitely return and recommend Bocata, but it isn't cheap so be prepared."}
{"text":"The restaurant was quite good. We ordered many of the snacks & appetizers with the best being the fromages de Noyan and Pata Negra De Bellota. I ordered the Loup De Mer Roti. It was probably the mostly expertly made sea bass I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The ambience of the restaurant is really quiet lovely."}
{"text":"People are genuinely at your service.  A bible of cocktails to please. If it's not on there,  the knowledgeable bartender is more than happy to accommodate. Music and ambience is by far my favorite in ville marie. The table skills are on point. Kudos!

Make sure you have reservation for table or chance it at the 8 ish seat bar."}
{"text":"My first night in Montreal, I had dinner here with a friend.  Excellent fish entree, crab cakes, and atmosphere.  Wine is a bit expensive and light pour, but five stars nonetheless."}
{"text":"This was lovely. Marianne and I and  my 13 year old son went for dinner.  Charming interior.  Cozy. Friendly service.  Really good food.  Squid ink risotto especially good in my book.  $$$ but worth the trip."}
{"text":"Bocata was the perfect antidote to a cold, gray day in Montreal. We sat at the bar and received great service.   Fantastic oysters from PE Island,  a lovely stuffed pepper and fantastic cod as an entree.  Our waiter made great wine and food suggestions."}
{"text":"Adorable and charming decor in and out. Alway love the \"B\" sign outside. Tiny restaurant and very warm feeling inside.  Great staff from the hostess to the server. The food was awesome. Not in love with the appetizer we had (albacore tartare) but the main dishes were amazingly delicious.  Tartare was fine but something is missing...looks pretty though. 

The Mediterranean Sea bass was a bit different than normal crispy skin at other restaurants. It's skinless and on a pile of shiitake mushroom, spinach n sweet potato purÃ©e.  The whole thing was so soft and yummy. Every single bite. And the fish size was more than generous. Like the whole fish with 2 big filets. 

Thyme roasted milk fed veal chop. Just the name itself is divine and the dish was amazing. Perfectly cooked chop and the homemade gnocchi on the side was delicious as well. 

Really didn't expect such awesome meal from this place but was pleasantly surprised. If the tartare was better, would give this place 5 stars. Wish I could go be it 4.5!!!  

The limoncello glacÃ© deader was also awesome too."}
{"text":"The ambiance was unique. The music set the tone while the lighting and decor created an intimate atmosphere. We were greeted by an enthusiastic and accommodating hostess. She showed us to the bar where we enjoyed some spectacular cocktails crafted by a bartender that was visibly upset. Shortly thereafter, we were seated. Despite being overwhelmed by a massive influx of patrons, the waiter was kind and engaging. He was knowledgeable and made some great suggestions. The menu was rather limited but the food was exceptional. We would go back again."}
{"text":"We were so thrilled with this restaurant that we dined here two nights in a row. Food was delicious and the service was fantastic (on the second night they accommodated us at very short notice, despite being very busy). One of the best dining experiences we've had in Montreal. Look forward to returning on our next trip."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. We had the duck confit salad and the roasted duck magret. Both were brilliant, the salad being near the best we have ever had.

While staying at the Old Montreal the location is also very good. Service couldn't have been better!"}
{"text":"This was a great discovery recommended by a friend. The ambiance is really cozy and the food is quite tasty. Definitly would recommend it to a friend;)"}
{"text":"Ambiance 5, Service 5, Food 3.  everything's was pretty creative but mostly salty , menu not clear and not many options to choose from."}
{"text":"After taking in our options in vieux Montreal,  my husband and I chose Bocato to eat a very late meal.  Though it was 10:00 pm, all but two tables at this quaint restaurant were taken. Our server was delightful.  The atmosphere was picture perfect...almost like a movie set...too good to be true but it was! They offer something like tapas...the plates are slightly larger. We ordered four items plus a mixed drink for him and a glass of pinot noir pour moi. We began with a rare Spanish charcuterie...some kind of pig that was only fed acorns its whole life. Two of the pig's friends' legs were hanging just over the bar! Wow! What a unique flavor.  There is nothing to compare. Next we had an arugula salad with smoked duck. To die for. Lastly, we were served braised beef cheek with caramelized onions and the lightest mashed pots followed by a pasta dish that was like the goddess of mac n cheese. All plates were beautifully presented.  Everything everything everything made this the hands down best meal I have ever had!

Also, they were playing the most excellent mix of indie and adult contemporary music."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Wine prices are a little high but worth the great food and great service. American friendly.  Small place so make a reservation."}
{"text":"our last night in montreal was not a disappointment!  try the english mojito!  fresh cucumber added to the classic drink. we shared two starters and then had fish and lobster carbonara. both superb. the place has a old local feel. like dads old office  very comfy. we were given time between courses to relax and drink our fantastic wine. then finished with espresso and tiramisu served in a mason jar. delicious from start to finish."}
{"text":"Quaint and cozy place.  Food was good, great service. Loved the European feel. Great wine selection."}
{"text":"Went to Bocata with a group of 10. Outstanding food, great ambience, staff that care about their customers. Staff were very knowledgeable about food and wine. 
Will be back soon. Their kitchen also services the restaurant next door so will try there as well."}
{"text":"The room is small and cozy, the menu limited. The service is professional. Dishes are very nicely presented and delicious, albeit on the small side; they are tapas. 

A surprisingly varied wine list (by the glass) for such a small establishment; affordable prices.

We started with the Duck confit salad (we enjoyed it so much, later ordered another); p i n t a d e e t m o r i l l e s a u v i n j a u n e (only thing is it left us wanting more of the confit de pommes de terre au curry ); Queue de homard rÃ´tie en viennoise de basilic, mayonnaise romesco et salade de fenouil au citron was beautifully presented I wanted to take a pic but was not willing to use flash, tasted as good as it looked; J O U E D E B O E U F's wine sauce was among the best I've tasted; the d e s s e r t d u m o m e n t was a molten chocolate cranberry brownie sprinkled with crushed pecans and served with sorbet; mom had p a i n p e r d u a la b r i o c h e a u c h o c o l a t avec Bananes Ã  la fleur de sel caramÃ©lisÃ©es (only thing tiny short coming aside from the candle's size-too big for the small table) the chopped hazelnuts were not crisp.

I'd return with the specification that again we'd start our evening early, we had a 6:30 p.m. reservation, half-way through the meal the place filled up and the service while professional and extremely informative, of course, became harder to get.

Small restaurant, small plates, big flavours - was the title of one of the reviews I read and I agree with.

La chambre est petite et confortable, le menu limitÃ©. Le service est professionnel. Les plats sont trÃ¨s bien prÃ©sentÃ©s et dÃ©licieux, bien que sur le petit cÃ´tÃ©; ils sont des tapas. 

Une carte des vins Ã©tonnamment diverse (par le verre) pour un si petit Ã©tablissement; prix abordables.

Nous avons commencÃ© par la salade de confit de Canard (nous l'avons aimÃ©(l'avons joui de) tellement, a commandÃ© plus tard un autre); p je n t un d e e t le m o r je l l e s un u v je n j un u n e (il a Ã©tÃ© laissÃ©e nous voulant plus du confit de pommes de terre au le curry); la file d'attente de homard rÃ´tie en viennoise de basilic, la mayonnaise romesco et salade de fenouil au le cÃ©drat a Ã©tÃ© admirablement prÃ©sentÃ©e j'ai voulu prendre un photo, mais n'ai pas Ã©tÃ© enclin Ã  utiliser le flash, goÃ»tÃ© aussi bon qu'il a regardÃ©; J O U E D E B O E U F la sauce de vin d'Ã©tait parmi le mieux que j'ai goÃ»tÃ©; le d e s s e r t d u m o m e n t Ã©tait un brownie de canneberge de chocolat fondue aspergÃ©e de noix de pÃ©can Ã©crasÃ©es et a servi avec le sorbet; la maman avait p un je n p e r d u b la r je o c h e un u c h o c o l un t avec Bananes Ã  Fleur la de sel caramÃ©lisÃ©es (seulement la chose l'arrivÃ©e courte minuscule Ã  part de la taille aussi de la bougie grande pour la petite table) les noisettes coupÃ©es n'Ã©taient pas craquantes.

Je retournerais avec la spÃ©cification que de nouveau nous commencerions notre soirÃ©e tÃ´t, nous avions 18h30 la rÃ©servation, au milieu du repas la place rempli et le service tandis que le professionnel et extrÃªmement informatif, bien sÃ»r, est devenu plus durement pour arriver.

Le petit restaurant, de petites assiettes, de grandes saveurs - Ã©tait le titre d'un des revues que j'ai lus et je suis d'accord."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious delicious!!!! This place is an absolute must stop and eat in montreal. the restaurant is small but so cute! We sat right by the window. The food was amazing! The sea bass, wonderful. The squid ink risotto, a must! Great lasting impression!!"}
{"text":"Tonight we made the rookie mistake of going out into Old Montreal looking for dinner without making a reservation first. Luckily, Bocata had a few seats at the bar and were able to serve us anyway.

We started out with some drinks and if I were to split up my rating, I would definitely give the bartender and the drink 5-stars. I ordered the bloody goblin which was absolutely outstanding. I typically don't like sweet drinks too much but this drink had the perfect level of sweetness with an herbal aroma to compliment it well.

For an appetizer I had the duck salad which was also outstanding and deserving of five stars. For the main dish, we all ordered the veal which was tasty but not at all deserving of the price tag it came with. The meat was pretty tough and not really anything to write home about. I would give the veal two and a half to three stars. I should not have ordered dessert because I already ate way too much but I did anyway and had a rich chocolate lava cake with homemade raspberry vanilla ice cream. The ice cream was pretty delicious but the lava cake was okay. I probably would have enjoyed it all a lot more if I wasn't already stuffed.

Overall, I was happy with this place and I would be happy to return here. I'm happy to add this to my list of nice Montreal restaurants that are within walking distance of my hotel."}
{"text":"I stopped by at like 530 on a Tuesday. I heard this was a good place to try some wine so I figured I'd stop by and see if I could get a table or sit at the bar without a reservation. I believe they had just opened so I had the place to myself with a nice window seat. I asked the waitress if she recommended any good wine with the meal I was getting and she did. Let me try two of them and I picked my favorite. I ordered the lobster pasta dish (I forgot it's official name) and she came out with some fresh bread and oil for dipping. It was all very good. I'd definitely go again. She then recommended some desserts and I had the carrot cake with carrot ice cream. It was amazing! Best carrot cake I've ever had. 

I will note that I didn't have any problems getting a table without a reservation at 530, but several people started showing up at about 615 and were turned away because they were booked up. There are only 4 or 5 seats at the bar and those were all full. 

It was very good food and a nice vibe. It's a very small restaurant and very quaint."}
{"text":"Beautiful and charming. Had Pata Negra to start, always delicious and expensive. Lobster carbonara and halibut special were delicious. Nice beer and wines to choose from"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. My friend got the lobster carbonara and I had the Loup. We were quite uncertain about which wine to have so the serveur had us try some (we had different one, because different food) and I must say it was on point.

Make sure to come in early so there is some of that chocolate cake left (we didnt have the chance to try it but I'm sure it is as amazing as the rest!)

We will be back !"}
{"text":"Food ***** Excellent Veal Chop
Wine ***** Very nice
Service ***** Great
Ambiance *****  The Bocata is a charming place to dine.  Love the vintage rock music.  Overall, it was an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"Quite a good menu! Lots of different options- something for everyone! Might be hard to find something good for kids. The menu had really good prices. We came here on our first night in montreal, and it was in such a great area! The ambiance was really nice and it was in a perfect area to walk around after(Old Montreal). The service was great! Couldn't ask for anything more!  Great, cozy spot!!! Really good desert too."}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner of oysters, duck and molten lava cake. Felt like I was in Paris. Merci B"}
{"text":"Amazing food - I love the duck salad,also the lobster pasta was al dente and yummy.  The fig desert was perfect. Excellent service and a very cozy place.  One of my favorites when I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!

I'm a person who has much attention to details, and I would say Bocata is perfect in them. The decorations, design, service, and even the washroom is perfect. The napkins are special, the bread basket is special, the seats are comfortable, the signature cocktail menu is on a bottle, there are paintings and a fake fish on the wall, there are different candles, there are books, dry ham and other decorations.

For the food, it is also very good! We ordered an off menu special, a rib eye for two to share, the mushrooms are juicy and the rib eye was cooked perfect. The only thing is that I felt like there is a little more fat in the rib eye than there should be. We also ordered a squid ink risotto as a main. The risotto was perfect. We all loved it! Oh for the appetizer we had the Burrata. There was a lot, and we ate it with regular bread after we finished with the bread in the dish, and it was still so tasty. The pickled fish was great. For dessert, we ordered the carrot cake and the lemon pie. The waitress told us it was the last lemon pie. I would say the carrot cake was perfect. The lemon pie could be a little more sour. I would like it to be more sour.

I love it! I really love this place!"}
{"text":"Someone asked, so here's an update: from what I remember, the beers they offer were from L'Alchemist brewery.  They had the Bock and a blonde."}
{"text":"Excellent cheese plate with local cheeses.  A very good selection of wines. Wonderful ambience."}
{"text":"Not fussy but focused on good southern France Mediterranean food and drinks. Staff are oh so friendly and helpful. Simple fried smelt to much on with the drinks. Creamy Squid ink risotto with nice whole shrimp and scallops. I had the rib eye cap which had a deep roasted earthy flair with the mushrooms. And the Lemon curd with the luscious marshmallow meringue is so unique yet so comforting. Of course the people watching is fun especially later as they walk down the street."}
{"text":"Quaint little European bistro in old town with the best braised bacon. Seriously.  I'm brunching and yelping at the same time.  Here's how we are brunching: fried eggs n mash sobrassada, eggs bourguignon (really amazing), Spanish tortilla and chickpea Shaksuka -- everything was magnificent. Snag a window table. Charming feel, vintage vibe, old books, and old brick. My kinda hole in the wall feel.  I'm beginning to fall in love with this city. Savor the whole experience with a bottle of champagne and freshly squeezed OJ. Merci #bocata Merci!"}
{"text":"Excellent resto avec service toujours impeccable! Les choix des vins et de la nourriture est toujours intÃ©ressant"}
{"text":"First class all the way. Service: genuinely friendly and no stone left unturned, with a stop in from the sommelier, who provided helpful input on the delicious \"new style\" Bordeaux we ordered. Shiny, happy, pretty people, vibe relaxed (it's Montreal!) but the food experience lives up to any expectations you might have. I had a lobster tagliatelle -- the sauce it comes with was so perfect it nearly made me pass out, and I confess I had to get every last drop by mopping it all up with bread as well. My lovely companion enjoyed an octopus salad that was also first rate. Tagliatelle has what so many other places with tapas and wine and \"foodie cred\" lack: warmth."}
{"text":"This was a lovely place for dinner.  We were 4 in total with  13 and 17 year old boys.  Both loved everything they ordered even with anchovies!

The service was superb.  My husband said the lemon meringue was the best dessert he has ever had. The host was friendly, helpful and seemed to be the owner of Bocata.  We would all go back in a heartbeat and will tell everyone traveling to Montreal to make this a must do dinner!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here. First off the look of the restaurant is very sexy- dark and intimate. The music however, does not go well with the atmosphere. They should definitely put on some spanish music instead of pop.

The service was not great. We waited a long time for our server to get our drink and food orders. And another server came to give us the wine we ordered, that she served without even saying a word to us.

Now, other than that- the food was absolutely amazing! A decent vegetarian selection- they offered to make us some dishes that typically contained meat- as vegetarian.

We had the tomato toast, cheese selections, patatas bravas, tomato salad, asparagus salad (absolutely delicious) and the house made mozzarella with truffles.

Will absolutely be coming back and would highly recommend as spanish-quebec fusion!"}
{"text":"Top rate in every aspect.  Excellent cellar.  Fresh vegetables from their garden.  Wonderful, classic dishes with some occasional innovations.

Try it!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!  Came here for my birthday dinner and it was fabulous.  I loved the atmosphere with the stone, candles, and the old books.  The service was excellent.  I tried a few small plates and a few wines.  I liked the wines by the glass list - they have 2.5 ounce pours or 5 ounce pours.  

I tried the smelts, watermelon, duck confit salad - all were good.  The watermelon was inventive and had a lot of flavors going on.  Definitely a good place to come hungry and try a lot of different things.  

The waitress was awesome - she had great wine recommendations and was on the ball.  I can't imagine switching between 2 languages and managing several tables at a busy restaurant and our waitress did it gracefully!

The atmosphere is cozy and romantic. Made for a great birthday!"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Came here on our first night in Montreal.

Ambience was great.  Loves the way the place is decorated.  

Food and service was excellent.  Price was more than reasonable.  Would very much recommend.

If I had to find something to criticize - I Would say that I wished the bread was warmed up.  But everything was SOOO good.

I had the halibut special.  My husband had the lobster cabarena.  And we had the octopus to share.  Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Best cocktails we've had in Montreal.  First visit to the city and overjoyed to find these amazing craft cocktails.  Great vibe."}
{"text":"In the heart of old town Montreal, quant and beautiful inside.  This is the type of place I like to take my wife for a romantic evening.  Like most every nice place in Montreal, you don't want to be in a hurry.  I started with a superb asparagus appetizer, tipped with ricotta and thin Italian ham and some herbs.  This was my favorite part of the meal.  For done I had duck, the meat was perfect served with truffles and broccoli. There was some form of slaw and an egg on three side that did not age with my taste buds, so I DOD not finish this side. This it's a great find, I recommend a reservation."}
{"text":"I had the best breakfast sandwich ever here. Very cute atmosphere, good service, great food."}
{"text":"Had dinner her last night and it was really really good. Ordered Yellow tail special, oysters and burrata appetizers. I'm not usually an oysters person by the rest of my group wanted them. They were really tasty and not chewy at all. The burrata had truffles and anchovies on it and it was amazing. I was day dreaming about it after we had finished it. And the yellow tail hamachi was so so tasty. I'm not exactly sure what was with it, but the fresh dark dark red tuna with some savory salty goodness was just really tasty. For entree I go the rosemary pork chop, which had a good browning crust and was juicy with a nice saltiness and hints of rosemary. over all it was a really good meal and I would 100% return."}
{"text":"Small and unpretentious. A low keyed, friendly stop. Great service. Bocata's signature dessert-a lemon tart, stole the show. We started with tasty smelts, batter fried. The lobster tagliatelle was a tad over- sauced but beautifully presented. Any and all concerns melted at dessert. The tart was gorgeous to look at, divine to bite into. Not to missed, only to be remembered! Merci, Bocata!"}
{"text":"I made reservations here about 2 weeks prior to my visit - a late Friday night dinner. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, seeing as how the majority of the other restaurants I'd looked at in old Montreal were completely booked for any reasonable dining hour on the night in question. Suspicious...

Well, much to my delight, this place was great. A very small, intimate environment, made all the more interesting with authentic \"cracked\" brick walls fitted with candles, complete with running wax spillover. Very cool. In short, a great  backdrop for a night out with the wife.

The service was great, our waiter was definitely on his game.

There's clearly an emphasis on seafood when it comes to the menu, so I decided on the warm octopus salad, and the squid ink seafood risotto. Both were prepared perfectly.

They also have a very good selection of wines by the glass, which seemed to me to have been curated very specifically, which is atypical of most restaurants these days, so extra marks there. 

Overall, a great dinner with great service. If I lived near here I would definitely treat it as a go-to for casual dinners with family and friends."}
{"text":"Bocata is a very cute and cozy restaurant on a very cute cobble stone street. The man friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience here. 

We came in for a late dinner on a Monday night and sat at the bar. Both of the servers were very nice, personable and accommodating. The food was really good and they have a pretty decent wine selection. (loved their wine dispenser) 

We ate:

Pata Negra de Bellota - omg I love Jamon Iberico. It's sooo tasty! Just the right amount of saltiness and sweetness from the meat....

Duck confit salad with a crispy egg - the man friend loved it so much he didn't even save a bite for me! sigh

Lobster Carbonara Tagliatelle - came with tomatoes, spinach and an egg yolk in its shell. This was so delicious! The egg yolk added a nice creaminess to the pasta. The veggies added some brightness to the dish and there was plenty of lobster mixed in with the pasta. 

The portions here are not big. Most of the restaurants we dined at in Montreal had much bigger portions but this was just enough for the both of us. We both left happy and satisfied and headed to Le Lab - recommended by the servers."}
{"text":"I was looking at places for dinner near Old Montreal and the concierge suggested Barrocco Restaurant.  Looking at the Menu outside my fiancÃ© and I decided on Bocata ( next door). 

 We walked inside and I instantly feel the romantic vibe. There's deep brown wood ceilings, bookshelves with old books, a brick wall, dim lighting and candelabra's and candles on the tables. They transformed an old book into the drink menu, very cute.

 There's an automatic wine bar that dispenses the Wine and keeps the temperature regulated and air-tight, as well as perfect pour.  The wine list on a chalkboard, they serve by the glass and half glass as well as bottles.

The hostess sat us near the window and I asked her about recommendations. The hostess was very friendly and pointed out the warm Octopus salad among other delicious apps.

The waitress offered sparkling or flat water. We ordered the warm Octopus salad to nibble on and ordered Steak and Mediterranean sea bass as our mains.

The Octopus was cooked to perfection, not chewy at all, and a delicious flavour. even though I knew it was a warm salad it still was surprising to take a bite of a warm salad dish, it was Memorable.

The Steak was tender , no need for a knife, and came with a Beet purÃ©e. It was tasty but really such a tease size, it was the size of our app. I felt sorry for my Man he Eats, and the waitress didn't mention the Entrees are Very small plates.

   The Mediterranean sea bass looked more like a snapper *see pictures, and was by far the smallest piece of Sea Bass I have ever ordered.  It was accompanied by
Sweet potato purÃ©e and had crispy pieces of sweet potato in it, out of this world flavourful. There was also some fish roe on top. Again small, we should have ordered two more dishes! 

Yes I asked for more country bread for my Man, and he still left hungry.

  We had a nice romantic dinner, the ambiance was definitely there, good looking diners, the food delicious, it's just disappointing to leave a Restaurant hungry.  

  If there was a little more food its an easy 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"This is is cutest date spot ever, and it reminded me of the Mediterranean. It's one of those places where the owner runs the front of house playing sommelier, bartender and server without missing a beat. There were other staff at the hostess desk and running food. They worked well as a team. Our meal was never interrupted wondering where dishes, drinks or condiments were. Gorgeous place, too.

We started with a dozen Beausoleil oysters with Montreal Smoke Show jalapeÃ±o sauce on a couple. We got pata negra with traditional Catalan tomato bread and smelt, a delicacy anyone from Michigan or the Great Lakes knows.

I ordered a sparkling Greek biodynamic white wine as an aperitif, and he recommended a bottle of one of their wines by the glass that was more consistent than organic wines can sometimes be. It complemented our meal nicely, as our main course was their lobster carbonara.

The carbonara was light on the pepper, though they would add as much as you liked. The bacon was fat cuts of lardon. You got a nice piece of tail and a claw. Then the tagliatelle was arranged in a pretty birds nest with a quail egg in the middle that you stir in yourself at the table.

For dessert, we had grapa and espresso with a delicious lemon meringue tart with pistachios and ice cream. It was a perfect and memorable meal, better than Le Serpent!"}
{"text":"Be aware of the concept before you rejoice about the prices - $14 for such appealing dishes does sound like a bargain. This small restaurant will serve you small plates and not actual dishes. I thought the Old Port was facing some severe disinflation effects for a second. Hungry stomachs should aim for at least three dishes.

Within a brick-designed interior, filled with trendy and wannabe uptight crowd, the menu reveals some pretty interesting dishes. I had some pretty good oysters and duck salad. Additionally, their signature meat style will literally melt in your mouth. I wish I tried their Carbonara homemade gnocchi (which aren't named gnocchi and not potato-based). Moreover, their Pear Sorbet is appreciable and their by-the-glass wine list is quite diverse (Oregon, France, Ontario).

And here comes another trick by the way: you can get half-glasses of wine for $9. Despite their very stylish wine bar, I am quite reluctant to pay almost $20 for a sizable glass of decent wine.

Despite a tasteful experience, I have mixed feelings regarding the service. Surely not pretentious as the environment might suggest, but not really careful and diligent . The food presentation is not appealing and the waiters will actually bring all of your plates at the same time thus encumbering your space. Friendly overall, however.

Bocata is still a recent place and has quite some potential but simple details do go amiss. Too bad there is not a 3.5 stars rating available though.

To enjoy for a late diner if you are not too hungry."}
{"text":"Lots of hype without much follow through. The food was average, the surf and turf was delicious, charcuterie not so great. The chocolate bread pudding needed serious work. Anyone who said it was amazing is either an invalid or has no clue what good food tastes like. The one thing I wasn't impressed with was the wine-by-the-glass list. Who the hell buy a $33-$45 glass of wine ? I'm not interested if it's exclusive or not. It's an open bottle and nobody in the right mind would water their time. That was upsetting, otherwise great decor, hip crowd and decent yet pricy food."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. We found it by accident & was lucky we were able to get in. Our party of four agreed this place deserves a 5 star rating. Food, service and atmosphere is superb!! It is advisable to call & make reservations."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. We had dinner for 3 people, all were satisfied. Located in historic building in Old Montreal, stone and wood walls, nice casual ambiance. Had appetizer crab cakes and red stuffed pepper - very good. For entre I loved my dish of sea bass, husband had veal chop, super tender and third dish was tuna tartar. Dessert of fondant of chocolate and red wine. We are very happy with preperation and taste. Service was friendly though wait was getting longer once the restaurant filled up.
We'll definitely will come back."}
{"text":"We tried at the last minute to get a reservation and they were accommodating to get us in. For our dinner, we started with the cheese plate, entrees were the halibut (which my husband said was the best he has ever had) and the cavatelli, and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert. All were very good. There also is a selection of unique house drinks. Very friendly staff and good service. The tables are a bit crowded, so no private conversations, but that was fine with us. The one improvement would be to offer just one or two lighter entrees."}
{"text":"Great place along the streets of old MontrÃ©al ! The staff were very attentive, and friendly. This restaurant has a cute charm to it, something unexpected. We sat at the bar for drinks and apps, but are definitely going back for dinner since we saw all of the delicious looking entries coming out . . Never have I seen a bad take such time to make a mixed cocktail and not be rushed !A must try while your in town"}
{"text":"Bocata has a eclectic, funky decor and a cozy, dark, cavernous vibe. More importantly, they have a good wine list (creatively pasted in the pages of an old book) and a pretty decent by-the-glass wine selection. You can order a half or a full glass, which is fun because you can try more that way. If you ask nicely, they might even give you a tasting sample to try before you commit. The per glass prices are a little steep, but pretty on par for the neighbourhood (Old Montreal).

They also do some really tasty tapas-sized dishes. The salmon tartare is refreshingly innovative, the oysters are fresh, and there's usually some dish involving lobster.  They also occasionally hold special tasting events (for example, a tasting menu paired with Spanish wines, wines from Jura, sherry, etc.). Although it is technically a wine bar, they do seem to expect you to order food, and I would recommend going for a light meal or snack rather than just for drinks. It's a small space, so reservations are recommended to avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"The decor is very cute and quaint, I like the effort they put to make it cozy and authentic. 

As an entrÃ©e, we took the burrata. I was very disappointed as it was just the ball of cheese and a bit of olive oil. For the price it was, I thought they would add extra to it. Then we got the squid risotto and that was excellent! Highly recommend. As a dessert, we got a key lime pie and some donuts, they were fine. I wished they offered more elaborate options for their desserts. 

Lastly, the service was good."}
{"text":"Very-very disappointed. The worst foie gras I have ever tried- it tasted like pure butter or even margarine. We even asked the waiter to take it back and didn't pay for it.The bruschetta was nothing special as well as the lobster roll. I have eaten much-much better ones from the food truck in New Brunswick. So the atmosphere was good, but noisy. I wouldn't recommend  the place to my friends - it doesn't worth visiting ...especially for such prices."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Our server, Victoria, was great! She recommended a delicious wine. The apps and entrees were delicious. The dessert, lemons curd was outrageous. Really worth a visit"}
{"text":"The ambience is really nice and service is really good. Food is is okay. Wine is delicious. Kinda price, but fair to the location"}
{"text":"So this place is pretty nice, same owner as baroco next door but just not as quite as amazing.  Food was delicious and you can tell the ingredients are top notch. Good atmosphere and good ambiance as well!"}
{"text":"Wasn't quite as enamored with Bocata as I was with its sister restaurant next door, Barraco, but nonetheless-this was a great experience.

Fluke crudo was phenomenal. Mains were very good, pork chop and Lobster Carbonara. 

Great service, nice space. Feels like a slightly more casual and mainstream menu than Barraco next door, but both are worth trying."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place, I'd give it a 3.5 but rounded it down because the cons outweigh the pros. 

The place is more of a dinner/bar place, but also opens for brunch. Because of that the inside is really dim, which wasn't a huge problem but just for brunch time they should really lighten up the place. 

Workers were nice, they were patient in waiting for our friend who was running late and in general friendly. 

The food was very tasty, at least for me, I really liked my French toast and the maple butter. Sweet and creamy. But charging $12.65 for a piece of bread with some butter, no matter how tasty, is pushing it a tiny bit too much. Portion is small and wasn't very filling, especially for a brunch. 

My friend ordered granola with yogurt and fruit, and that became the laughing stock of our meal 'cause the portion is TINY for a $9 dish. It was served on a plate, not a bowl, and there was like 2mm thickness to the layer of yogurt. 

My other friend's arctic char with avocado turned out to be the most value and also tasty, coming at $16, but even that's pushing it given the portion. 

It doesn't cost much to add some hash browns or some fruits to the side of these dishes. Just a bit more to make it tasty AND filling would make this experience worth it but it unfortunately wasn't.

They do have really nice napkins though."}
{"text":"Just delightful. You know you were in for a special evening when the waiter is also one of the owners. A terrific selection of wines by the glass including unusual and off and on scene selections. Pores are offered in 2 1/2 ounce and 5 ounce amounts, and sampling is encouraged.
    Now let's talk about the food. Spectacular. They have a oysters, Pata Negra (that's cured ham from pigs who eat only acorns, is from Spain, and is rather pricey.... but they have it). Also wonderful fish and pasta.
     After dinner, there are choices of port, Sherry, cognac, Calvado's, Armagnac, and all the whiskeys and dessert wines you could imagine.  Wow !"}
{"text":"This charming tiny restaurant is located on a narrower quaint street in Old Montreal and has great ambiance.  It's very eclectic, rustic in style and candlelit. There is a small bar with half dozen bar stools or so and the dining area has two curved booths and maybe 10 tables. The gentleman who greeted us and actually served us was friendly and provided good service.  We ordered a bottle of Montelpulciano d' Abruzzo and the fried smelt to begin. The smelt were very small in size, 3\" long, lightly fried and served with a lemon aioli. They were light and tasty with a little crunch. I was brought back to my childhood and my mom and grandma making smelt.  For dinner, my husband had the veal chop. It was cooked medium rare and a nice-sized portion. The veal was served with homemade gnocchi. My husband devoured it and said is was fantastic. I had the lobster carbonara tagliatelle. The sauce was a very light carbonara, not made with heavy cream.  This dish had lobster, bacon, shallots, sundried tomatoes and egg. The menu said egg yolk in its shell, but it wasn't served that way; there was an egg on top of the pasta minus the shell presentation. This dish missed the mark for me even though there were large pieces of lobster. Being 100% Italian, I expected a tastier dish. The bacon or pancetta was wilted and could have been cooked crisp for texture and the dish lacked Parmesan cheese and salt. I think if there was cheese in the carbonara or grated on top, it would have elevated the flavor.  After dinner, the check was presented in an old book which patrons write notes in. A cute touch and I added a note, too.  All in all, I would recommend this small bistro even though my entree was lacking. Everything else was good and the atmosphere was unique. In looking at photos of the lobster carbonara from reviewers here and on Trip Advisor, it seems this dish varies in presentation.  I think it may be a dish to give a second chance."}
{"text":"I booked dinner table for five to celebrate my auntie's birthday
I asked twice ( once at the booking and another request when I received a call from them asking to confirm our attendance) to have a subtle candle or a chocolate written celebratory message on desert plate and I was assured they can do that! 

Upon arrival we had a look at the menus and the server suggested that we share main plates ( they are big portions)!!! Well, it is certainly not a tapas place 
And certainly not enough portions to share 
And certainly a wrong suggestion!! 

The portions are small size! Mainly fish ( which is not very filling) ! And even after ordering every main dish on the menu we left feeling hungry 
And secretly had another dinner back home! 
So if the management believe they are tapas place- they need to reconsider !!

Wine was nice 
And dessert was good too 
Except that my two time request was not met at the restaurant 
When I walked to the server asking about the matter he ignorantly told me no one told them about this request 
And that they actually don't cater for such requests !!!! 
I asked to talk to the lady who I spoke to and she was not available 

The food is really nice and the ambiance is cool 
But the little annoying things ruined the experience"}
{"text":"We eat here every time we come to the city. Great location, tasty and fresh food, service is good and it's go a cool atmosphere. We love the lobster rolls and they have a great selection of wine."}
{"text":"One of our best meals in Montreal was at Bocata.  This hole in the wall place, which is a bit dark and warm in summer, served up some creative and interesting food.  Plus, the service was nice and some great wine was to be had.

As one of the other reviewers pointed out it is best to approach Bocata knowing what you are getting into, which I agree with.  They do serve wine in two sizes by the glass and the prices are a bit high, but get a bottle!  Tell the sommelier what you like, and he'll recommend a bottle.  This is what we did and got a lovely spanish wine that we hand't had before and now I'm dying to find. Our server was very nice, informative, pleasant and just plain did a good job.  

The food is served tapas style, small plates, but are a bit different than traditional spanish tapas.  No patatas Brava for example, but don't let that stop you, there is some good flavors and creativity here.  We started with some Iberian Negra ham, a real pleasure and hard to get in the states so this was a good treat.  The bread served with it was out of sight.  We also had the heirloom tomato salad.  Fresh and amazing flavors.  Not too heavy and the flavor of the ingredient really showed through.

After that we had the beef cheeks, the halibut & mushroom duxelle, and and the veal with manchego.  The beef cheeks were tender, amazing complex flavors and the roasted shallots were a nice counter point.  The halibut was one of the best things I've had in a long time and probably one of the reasons I'm giving them 5 stars.  The fish was cooked perfectly, the mushrooms Devine and earthy, and the broth it was served in was a bit of genius and worked so well with the flavors.  The veal, well the veal was a disappointment.  The meat was cook properly and fine, but the polenta was not what I think of as creamy polenta and the manchego's flavor was lost in the polenta.  This dish needed some work or maybe my expectations were too high because of what came before.  

5 dishes was more than enough for dinner for two.  I would rather have 2 or 3 bites of something amazing than a whole plate of one thing, so Bocata fits the bill for me.  Can't wait to come back and eat there again."}
{"text":"Great food and lovely atmosphere. I especially enjoyed the olive oil for the bread which learned is from Crete."}
{"text":"Loved our meal here! Was looking for a smaller, cozier place for dinner and was recommended this restaurant by the hotel concierge. 

The space is small but still comfortable and service was amazing. Our waitress was so sweet and incredibly helpful. We started off w wine and a variety of apps including the cheese plate, mussels, smoked salmon, and the pan con tomate. All were delicious. Couldn't have been happier w the choices. 

I chose the lobster pasta for my entree and it was so so good. Simple yet flavorful. And dessert? Omg. We got the carrot cake w carrot ice cream and I wished we ordered a second one. So amazing. Good job Bocata! You guys definitely made Montreal enjoyable."}
{"text":"I found this little gem on Yelp - so a huge thank you to my fellow Yelpers for guiding me here.   This is a quaint, hip place with amazing food and great wine.   I came for the octopus and the oysters - and they were both fabulous.   The octopus was the star - it was phenomenal.   You must try it!   I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I thought long and hard about this one, the restaurant is a great spot for a romantic evening. The decor, setting, seating and lighting are all great.
The service is very friendly and the wine list is fantastic.
I'd like to see fewer cocktails with Jack Daniels but that's just me, however the food was where it lost stars. 
The oysters were a great start, nice choices, meaty fresh expertly shucked.
The tuna confit has a larger than needed garnish of chevril which isn't able to be eat (a large sprig doesn't lend itself to being eaten) and I wasn't sure how to be eating the chips and sour cream and caviar with the tuna. Ended up eating the tuna, then eating chips and very fancy dip. It came off as trying a bit hard.
The octopus and potato dish was pretty tasty, the octopus was well prepared but the sauce needed lemon adding that (and it could have used a bit of heat) made it much better but it really did need an acid on the plate. We had lemon for our water not the dish itself.
The main was a lovely well prepared roasted sea bass, which for reasons I can't understand had very bitter endive topping (it's on the menu but it was leaves, with an apple slice inside) the risotto was lentil based (I didn't ask about that as I just assumed rice so that one is on me I suppose) but it was just a very odd dish that again seemed to be trying a bit to hard. 
Service however was excellent and it was a nice spot, depends on what you are looking for."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place while looking for a quiet place for a few appetizers and a bottle of nice wine. Bocata did not disappoint! We did not have reservations but were seated no problem at a nice table by the window. The ambiance was beautiful: dimly lit, low music - exactly what we were looking for. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and had fantastic suggestions. We ordered the charcuteries plate to share which was simply divine! We followed this with the warm octopus salad and oysters. Our server paired our dishes with delicious wine (by the glass) and it was truly a great meal. The reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because they were all out of their specials (on a Wednesday evening?) and we had an unusually long wait for our drinks, +25 minutes. The server apologized and brought us a free dessert and glass of dessert wine which more than made up for the wait. I would definitely go back again."}

{"text":"I have to say that this was the best restaurant I ate at in Montreal. Our server was the best server I've ever come across (more like a friend I hadn't seen in a long time). She even gave up the restaurants Spotify playlist because the music was fantastic. The food was to die for. The oysters were hearty and delicious. Our server suggested a great bottle of wine. I can't say enough about this place. I cannot wait to take my family and friends back to this quaint restaurant. 


One of the best restaurants I have ever ate at!"}

{"text":"we've been here twice now, two years in a row, both during the holidays, post christmas. first year, we celebrated nye here, and the second, coming for a revisit to re-write our experience the first year. re-writing isn't a reflection of the restaurant, service or food...we were late getting here on nye, so understandably, they gave our seat away...they did make up with free champagne and other goodies, much of which i don't remember because the champagne had already gotten to my head by then!  

the second time around was marvelous...and who knew?! our same waitress remembered us from nye the year before! unfortunately, her name eludes me at the moment, but she is sweet and because of her, i'd go back and visit again.  

delicious food, really really really scrumptious on the palate. sexy, romantic vibe inside...thank you for two really great meals in montreal!"}
{"text":"We came to Bocata the first night of my bachelorette party in Montreal -- and thank god we did because it was amazing! 

The service:
1 word: VICTORIA. We were immediately seated as we had a reservation and Victoria our waitress greeted us. She was SO sweet and gave us some of the best wait service we've ever had. She really made it such a fun dining experience. We ordered shots at the end of our meal, Bocata covered a round and each time she took a shot with us. She helped my friends pick out a bottle of wine and was so patient with them. At the end of the meal we asked her if she knew any fun bars for us to go to and went and wrote a little list on paper and ever checked her Facebook to see what parties were happening that night. We actually used her list all weekend! ABOVE AND BEYOND!

The food:
Over all it was to die for. 
For appetizers we ordered the burrata, the cheese plate, and the asparagus (its in season right now in Montreal). All were great, but the burrata was outstanding. 

I ordered the sea bass, it came out crispy skinned and cooked to perfection on top of almost a purred hummus mixture. DELICIOUS. One of my friends ordered the crab and lobster squid ink risotto and O M G - out of this world. My other friend claimed \"this may be the best dish I've ever had\" referring to her lobster carbonara. 

Ambiance:
Sexy and dark ... all the other patrons here were nice too! 

If you are in Montreal... make this reservation, you will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"Best undiscovered treasure in old town! Food, wine and cocktails are all outstanding."}
{"text":"Very nice servers in a warm, romantic setting. The food was delicious, the music fun, the vibe enchanting. Busy enough to feel energetic, but without the tedious wait required at other nearby establishments. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Love this cozy restaurant conveniently located 3 blocks from my house. Needless to say that I'm there quite often. It's romantic, perfect for a date (sit by the fireplace) or keep it casual and sit at the bar. Food is delish and service is great."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dining here on our last day in Montreal and it was a nice way to wrap up after another day of sightseeing.  The ambiance here is lovely.  It's best described as intimate/romantic and vaguely makes me feel like I'm in a grotto adorned with grey bookshelves and candlelight. It showcased an older European mix of french and spanish influences, complete with a cozy stone fireplace (although it was not burning when we were dining).

We started our meal off with the Snow Crab Cake croquettes and the Tuna Tartare appetizers.   Both were pretty decent options.  I was glad that the chef was able to accommodate making our tartare without the Pata Negra since I don't eat pork.   Always a great sign that it's super fresh and made to order when you know it's not automatically mixed together.  Our crab croquettes were quite tasty as well; Enjoyed the crispy and light texture.  4/5

For my main, I went with the Squid Ink Risotto and again, they were able to make it without the pork (chorizo) which was very much appreciated.  Good assortment of mixed seafood and definitely a pretty filling dish.  Seafood was cooked nicely but the rice could've used just a tad more spice.  Nonetheless, it was pretty good just the same.  3.5/5       

Overall, a great stop to refuel before we made our way home.  Huge wine list btw if you love wine, both by the glass and by bottle.  Recommended if you're in the Old Montreal vicinity!"}
{"text":"In old town and worth looking for.  It is small and even at 9 on Sunday we had to wait to sit at the bar-- get reservations. Love the intimate, friendly atmosphere. You can feel a great meal is coming and will be rewarded. Probably only 20 tables so when the bar tender offers two choices of manhattans you realize they are serious about their craft. 
Lobster carbonara with bacon and mushrooms served with a lightly poached egg you break and stir a s you are served to thicken the sauce. You have to try this dish!!!"}
{"text":"Just in from San Francisco and looking forward to our reservation in Old Montreal. The service at Bocata was fantastic, the recommendations for food and wine were spot on, the food itself was really delicious and had the taste of careful homemade cooking.  The crab in the crab cakes was very fresh, as was the lobster in the pasta and the salad (dressing was perfect!).  Their sister restaurant next door was very lively and still packed at 11pm with the 30's business crowd. Apparently, the word is out about these restaurants!  Great experience."}
{"text":"Dim, sexy, rustic decor...just the ambiance we were looking for on a recent night out in Montreal.

After starting with a dozen perfect oysters and yummy shishito peppers, I went straight for the main event...a dish I had read about and couldn't wait to try: the lobster carbonara tagliatelle. Oh emm geee....that is one phenomenal pasta dish! Total foodgasm.

Dave's steak au poivre, however, was tough and sinewy. The sauce was deliciously rich, but the meat was just...no. Didn't enjoy this one. When the waitress saw the mostly uneaten steak, she offered to bring us a better cut of meat. We said we were already full so she just comp'd our cocktails instead. Thanks?

In the end, it was a great experience overall, but not quite as spectacular as its sister restaurant Barocco."}
{"text":"We came across this restaurant as we were strolling around the area looking for a spot for brunch and we were very pleasantly surprised! Four of us ordered a breakfast sandwich and it was delicious. The flavors went together really well and it was filling. The mimosas and smoothies were also very good. Didn't really like the donut or side of hash browns that we ordered with it, but everything else, including the decor, was lovely!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Wednesday night prior to a show.  Honestly, I picked this place due to the yelp reviews and that they had smelt.  I missed having it back home and wanted to try it.  OH MY, it is just as good as it is at home.  Also ordered the Squid Ink Risotto. Very good but the greenery on the top was over powering.  Great location, nice walk from our place.  Interior was nicely done and very quiet."}
{"text":"Went here the last night of a long weekend in Montreal. Everyone agreed it was the best dinner of the trip. Ambiance was wonderful and the food was really good. We went specifically for the lobster carbonarra and were disappointed to find out that they were out of the lobster due to an unusually high demand that day. However, the staff went over to the restaurant next door and borrowed the ingredients they were lacking. End result - a very memorably dinner. Will return next time we're in Montreal."}
{"text":"Food and service is really good. I do recommend it if you love wine and Seafood! I had the cod and it was very tasty. It's a little pricey and the selection is very small."}
{"text":"Tried duck confit and sea bass. Both very well presented. Be aware, the duck was a bit on the red side. Delicious food. Unique flavours. Exceptional service."}
{"text":"One of the best meals we've had in a while. Amazing food. Try the Veal chop and gnocchi, oysters, and the duck confit salad. Great service and ambiance! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I waited 1:00 for my dish! And It turns out that, the waiter did not place the order. My grandparents were starving and complain about the awful night. It ruins our mood although the food are really good. Highly recommend the bourguignon, super tender and flavourful! Squid ink risotto is very good if u like black pepper a lot. Warm stuffed pepper with goat cheese is good, decent. Lobster roll was served with ordinary lays chips and lobster meat is a bit too chill."}
{"text":"We went there last night for my 50th birthday.  We came to Montreal from Kelowna,BC (it was a surprise trip) so we wanted someplace special. The staff was fantastic and recommended a great wine that was not overpriced.  The food was great and our waiter made the whole night seem personal.  One of the best dinners I have ever had."}
{"text":"I loved eating here and would definitely come back. It's the only restaurant I've eaten at in Montreal, and I feel even if I go to many others, this one would still be on the top of the list. I loved the ambiance inside - wood-paneled, warm, cozy, and it felt like I was eating inside someone's study or library (sans dust - a clean, and well-kept library ;))

My co-worker and I shared all of the seafood dishes in the \"Fresh Catch\" section. My favorite was the Lobster Tagliatelle, she liked the Squid Ink Risotto best. They seem to rotate through dishes seasonally (awesome sign of a great restaurant!), because the menu online has changed since I visited a week ago.

Lobster Tagliatelle ($23) - The version I ate had cherry tomatoes, lobster, spinach, and the yolk that came in its shell - it was all so delicious. A must-have dish in my opinion. Not salty, very flavorful, and not too skimpy on the lobster.

Mediterranean Sea Bass ($17) - This had wild mushroom, spinach, vanilla infused sweet potato purÃ©e. The fillet of fish was a bit on the thinner side, but all the side veggies complemented the fish very well. It was a sweeter dish thanks to the sweet potato. It was good, no complaints, but I probably wouldn't get this again because I'd like to try other things.

Squid Ink Risotto ($19) - Really enjoyed this dish. Risotto was cooked perfectly and it had nice pieces of seafood and scallops inside.

Molten Chocolate Cake ($9) - Perfectly baked so that the entire texture of the cake was soft. It was not a hard cake with a runny middle, but almost just a soft, fluffy, chocolate cake. Perfect. I could have eaten an entire one (or two) of these, it was that good.

All in all, a delicious meal. The 3 dishes plus dessert was the right amount of food. I highly recommend splitting dishes if you come so that you can try a little bit of everything. With our 2 drinks, the total bill was a little over $100."}
{"text":"The food is not terrible, but the uneven service and tiny portions make this place very underwhelming. Finally, agree with earlier yelper that the wine list by the glass is tremendously overpriced."}
{"text":"What a fun experience, we sat at the bar as it was a holiday weekend and were very well (over) served with some fun cocktails and great wine. The only reason I have 4 not 5 stars is that although the individual components of some of the pairings (pork belly and snow crab) were delish, the pairing itself did not add anything. Nice to see smelts on the menu too, overall fun and not too pricey either."}
{"text":"Charming place. The service is impeccable. The atmosphere is very warm, sumptuous and appealing. There was classic rock playing not-overly-loud which I found quite appealing even with a group of 4 people at a full-sized table, but which some people might find a tad noisy.  The menu is not very large, but it is diverse, classy, healthy,  nicely prepared  and nicely plated.  For me the one deficiency was that I found the desserts all a bit too heavy, but I have twice heard the tiramisu was good."}
{"text":"Mixed meal.  Lobster carbonara was excellent, for sure the item to get.  Hubby's sea bass was tiny potion and unexciting accompaniments.  Pork chop was undercooked and fatty and I could only nibble at the edges; polenta it was served on was yummy but still disappointing dish.  Overall very disappointing given its high Yelp rating."}
{"text":"Floor staffs constantly check the status of each table and carefully service food and drinks. Quality of food is pure French but they line variety of south of France and mediterranean things in extremely high quality. Ribeye with mushroom was perfectly cooked as medium rare, and synchronized with the other dishes. Over all, just amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was INCREDIBLE! We were a party of 5 it's and the night started great with Hendricks and tonic. Oysters and bone marrow apps were also great. Our waitress warmed up to us eventually and had awesome recommendations for the rest of our night. Dinner we tried the lobster carbonara, halibut and squid ink risotto, all were perfect. The atmosphere is also awesome, very cozy and intimate experience. Will absolutely go back next time we're in Montreal."}
{"text":"Service was very good. The inside of the restaurant was decorated well. It is a nice place to go for the food/surroundings."}
{"text":"Came for brunch.  I did not have a reservation but they found me a seat at the bar. My choice (egg sandwich) was not available because the bread did not arrive today. As I waited for my new order, I saw half a dozen sandwiches sail by to other patrons.  My eggs on mashed potatoes was delicious, despite the sausage in the middle being cold. The side of bacon was stunning, with the perfect drizzle of maple syrup. Ambiance is fantastic and sitting at the bar feels comfortable.  I'd come back to try dinner but my experience doesn't put it top of list."}
{"text":"The \"home made\" brownie tasted like a bad batch of Duncan Hines.  I literally couldn't taste the chocolate.   Therefore, the pairing with the Nebbiolo was pointless.   Nice atmosphere and really wanted this place to work out; it's very charming.  I don't know, maybe I'll try again when the kitchen's open, just so I can mod this review.   Give it a shot but go in there with eyes wide open.  Bonne Chance!"}
{"text":"Really liked it. I had the truffle pepper spaghetti and my wife had the pork chop. We also had the crap cake and the lemon Meringue tart. All full of flavour. Smaller portions. Price wasn't too bad considering the ingredients used. Very nicely lit. The music playing was the right volume and suited to atmosphere. 

They a few quirky things that I will leave for you to experience. It's a fun little place."}
{"text":"Great food and Service. I was worried that in a tourist location it would be overpriced rubbish. I have to say, food, service ambience absolutely fantastic. Generally most food in Montreal is great and you get what you pay for. Not cheap but not overly expensive for the quality."}
{"text":"Bocata was amazing! The atmosphere was really cool and the food and service was amazing! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Bocata was okay when we first walked in... The food was much better and the waiter was good. You are definitely paying for ambiance and wine. Food is what to go for."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place when we tried to have a late night dinner at Stash Cafe which had closed for the evening. A wooden bar, vintage classic books, flickering candle light and large open windows all contributed to a rustic European ambiance. 

For starters we ordered the cheese plate featuring Quebec fromage and an asparagus dish. Both small plates were very tasty and nicely presented. The glass of Grenache I ordered was smooth, albeit overpriced.

The boyfriend went for the sea bass as a main dish. Unfortunately, my meal ended with the starters because there were no vegetarian main dishes featured. I supplemented my meal with snacks at the hotel later.

We were grateful to find a cozy place at such a late hour, but if we ever visit Montreal again, we will likely forgo this establishment and locate one with vegetarian options and food at a better value. I was also disappointed to see that most of the diners were Americans, which makes me wonder if this place primarily caters to tourists. That being said, I would still recommend if you are looking for a late night romantic meal in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Old Montreal for work and some coworkers suggested I go there for dinner as it was a block away from my place. I decided to try it yesterday (walked in without a reservation as it was a cold night and it was very early)... It was just me and the host was about to sit me at a table when her coworker suddenly whispered in her ear. She immediately said sorry I have nothing available but you can sit at the bar of you want. I have travelled around the world and I have tried the most prestigious restaurants, I have also dealt with racial profiling on numerous occasions, but this was hands down the worse experience I have ever had to deal with. I don't care how good the food is, everyone deserve to be treated equally. One's race, ethnic, age, or sex should never determine whether or not a person can be seated... Extremely disappointed/angry!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a wonderful meal at Bocata.  The service was attentive and knowledgable, but also well-paced and never pushy.  Everything we had was delicious.  The standouts were the Lobster Tagliatelle and the Steak au Poivre.  The setting is romantic and the location is great for strolling before and after dinner."}
{"text":"Bocata ranks as one of my top dining experiences of all time. The food was fresh and flavorful, and the drinks perfectly crafted. But what made Bocata so special was the rustic, old world charm that immediately engulfs you as you step through the door. Please do not pass this up, let yourself get lost in this fantastic little place."}
{"text":"Be charmed, wined and dined in a rustic setting that will warm you right up off the streets of Downqtown Montreal. Their selective menu is indicative of all well-done dishes that exude quality as well as presentation that appeals to all your senses. 
The owner Mitch and the entire staff are friendly, helpful and ready to share their thoughtful recommendations with their patrons. Service is on point with no empty glasses left unattended.
**************Look for their Chef, JP Miron, on upcoming TOP CHEF***********
Beef Tartare - we were so hungry we devoured it before taking any photos. Prime minced beef with licorice herb notes.
Batatas Brava - roasted potatoes with tomato aioli...again devoured prior to photo.
Cacio E Pepe - black pepper and black truffle pasta that would be the pride & joy of any authentic Italian chef.
Sea Bass - Mediterranean style with perfectly crisp skin and Smokey accompaniment with fresh endive and thinly sliced green apple.
Special of the Day - Seared scallops and a satisfying pea & mirepoix that is light yet hearty. I loved every bite of this dish.
Donuts with dulce de leche - almost impossible that this doughy goodness is not cloyingly sweet given the cinnamon sugar and golden caramel sauce.
Half baked chocolate chip cookie with house made Bourbon ice cream. Ice cream and melt in my mouth chocolate...just get it.

This was an inaugural dinner to be remembered.

{"text":"Came here with six colleagues for what was probably the best meal I've ever had in Montreal.  It's a very charming restaurant with attentive and caring service and creative menu.  My visit was a while ago, so unfortunately I don't recall a lot of detail, but I look forward to returning someday."}
{"text":"The food here was fantastic, appetizer of mushrooms on French bread with caramelized onions topped with truffles. Main course of a lobster roll and clam chowder. Glass of red wine. Excellent and friendly service; very professional. Absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"Am in town for a short getaway-- and came across this place when looking at a place that would be close to my hotel on a rainy night--- and was NOT disappointed - this place was INCREDIBLE-  it felt like a touch of Barcelona (patatas bravas)- blended with a twist of Montreal-  and a dash of home!  As someone who is surrounded by great restaurants at home in NYC - I don't generally make a resie twice at one place on vacation- this is the kind of place that merits a second visit !"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place last week while I was Montreal for business. 

Cool place- atmosphere is really neat and inviting. I sat down at the bar and said \"looks like a nice place to have a few cocktails\". The bartender quickly came back with \"sorry, if you want to drink you also have to order food, it's the law\". Hmmm ok. I wasn't planning on eating, but this was a blessing in disguise. 

Started out with a RYE Manhattan. She made a really good drink. I then ordered the lobster and ham carbonara. YUM. SHIT WAS GOOOOOOOD. lobster was super tender and the ham added a nice salty taste. 

I would for sure come back here for a meal!

And they give you your bill in an old book...."}
{"text":"I think there are better places in town if you want a full, hearty meal, but I can't imagine many places better than Bocata for grabbing a great glass of wine, sharing some small plates, and pretending you're in France (without the jetlag).

We had basically all of the charcuterie, and also had the octopus salad, and burrata, and they were superb (but when is burrata not superb?...).  The atmosphere here is great, especially on a nice night when the windows are open, and it's great to stroll around old Montreal after the meal.

Tres bien!

Food: 4/5
Value: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Atmosphere: 5/5"}
{"text":"The rustic, cozy charm of Bocata comes mostly from an exposed stone wall from the 1700s (or so I was told). My only decor complaint was the plastic prosciutto leg hanging over the bar. Why do restaurants do that??? 

Everything I tried was excellent, but the dishes ARE small. The scallops were crispy on the outside, tender inside. And the oysters were sooooo clean and mellow. Even one of my dining companions who doesn't like oysters devoured her share. The foie gras was unctuous. My only complaint was that there wasn't enough! And the salmon tare tare had a lovely, but not overpowering, sprinkling of fresh dill. 

While I didn't flip through the wine list, I saw it from across the table and it was a friggin novel. I'm glad I wasn't in charge of picking! 

I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for carefully prepared, high-quality food. If you want quantity, head elsewhere."}
{"text":"Loved this cozy little place. Two of us walked in without a reservation at 8 on a Saturday. Got seated in minutes. 

We had the charcuterie and cheese played which were served with warm bread with olive oil -- so delicious. The cavetelli with mushrooms -- perfection and the chocolate bread pudding -- very good. 

Also had a glass of wine. Enjoyed this place immensely. Might be my favorite stop during my time in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great location, cool vibe.  The waiter was very helpful.  I enjoyed the food and the wine, particularly the lemon tart which was out of this world.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nestled along the famous Rue St. Paul, is a quaint restaurant where you will no doubt have a fantastic meal.

Look for the lit up \"B\" and you will find, Bocata, a Spanish influenced bistro.

With only a few tables, be sure to make your reservation days in advance.

Bocata offers small plates and some entrees that are large enough to share. 

We started with the crab cakes. The order comes with only 2. They were very flavorful and make with true crab meat. Very pleased these were not heavy on mayo, which is what you see a lot.

We also ordered 15g of the cured meat. It reminded me of the jamon in Spain and Paris. Melts in your mouth!

For our main course, we shared the veal chop served with gnocchi. Wow! This was amazing. The veal was so tender. And the gnocchi was simply wonderful.

Finally, we ended with the frozen nougat. It was nice and not too sweet."}
{"text":"Absolutely recommended! 

My group of 7 had an exceptional experience- from booking the table for my wife's birthday to the service, quality of the food, and the fantastic ambience in Old Montreal.

We're a group of self-professed foodies and wanted to indulge in a great Montreal meal where we could try a wide variety of dishes. Bocata's small plates (and even the entree sized dishes) were perfect for this. We came to Montreal from (respectively) Chicago, NYC, and Washington, DC, so are no strangers to good eats. This was truly one of the best food experiences I've ever had and the perfect choice for our crew. 

After researching where to eat, I emailed Veronique about two weeks in advance to make sure the restaurant could accommodate us and she was very helpful and responsive. Our reservation was for 9 at first, but a few friends had emergencies and couldn't make it- there were no issues emailing Veronique to  update our reservation. 

Upon arrival, we were seated right away. The server(s) we had were knowledgable and gave us lots of tips and recommendations. I wish I had caught both of their names! They took excellent care of our group.

We opted not to order entrees in the traditional manner, but instead ordered plates in 3 or so courses, over a period of time and shared them family style among the entire group so we could all taste as many items as possible. We ordered at our leisure and never felt rushed- we were really able to enjoy all the entire experience. 

All of the items we tried were outstanding, but the highlights definitely included the lobster and fennel tagliatelle,  the osso bucco (the large portion was perfect for sharing with 7), and the squid ink risotto (we loved it so much, we ordered two plates). The smoked duck confit salad was also a table favorite. 

Most of us started with a cocktail- mine was the classic old fashioned- really well done. 

We then switched to wine. While I'd say we are wine lovers, many of the wines listed were way beyond accessible, and that is the only reason I didn't give Bocata 5 stars. Some of the less expensive bottles were only \"meh\", and even those were priced around $45/50 each. I would have liked to have had more options at  a lower price point. We splurged BIG on the food and so wanted to keep things a bit more reasonable on the drink side of things, which was difficult. 

We did have a bubbly toast for my wife, and selected a pinot noir varietal, which was really nice. 

All in all, everyone left satisfied and happy- it was a truly enjoyable experience from top to bottom and I hope to make it back to Montreal in the future so I can visit the sister restaurant located next door!

Thank you, Bocata!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Bocata since I loved barocco so much !  We went for dinner and sat at the bar on a Saturday. The decor was casual chic and very comfortable. The first thing that struck me is that this was a beautiful date restaurant with dim lighting and just a very nice vibe. We started with the octopus and potatoes  (great cook on the octopus but the potatoes were a touch underdone). I had the lobster carbonara which was delicious perfectly cooked lobster and pasta with great flavour. My boyfriend had the lobster boil dish and while the food was fresh and there was nothing wrong with it , he did say it lacked some spicing or something to make it stand out a little more. We also had the donuts for dessert which were nice and light and not overly sweet , they were a nice ending to the meal.  We had really great friendly service and they made a great wine suggestion for us. My only complaint is that I felt that it was a touch overpriced for what you get but definitely go in and try for yourself !"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have ever had! The service was great, the food was absolutely outstanding. Such good flavor combinations. If I am ever back in Montreal, I will certainly dine here again!"}
{"text":"Quaint, charming, romantic, adorable...are some of the adjectives I will use to describe this place. It reminded me of a bistro one might find in France.
We stayed around the corner and dropped in for brunch! 
We were not disappointed!
The staff was friendly and hospitable!
Shout out to our waiter, Eli and the hostess!!!
Our meals were delicious and creatively presented.
They also served us warm, fresh baked bread.

Can't wait to come back to Montreal and try this place for dinner!
Merci"}
{"text":"We definitely had one of the best restaurant experiences ever at Bocata on our vacation in Montreal. Coming from Los Angeles we were totally uncertain what the restaurant scene would be in Canada. Bocata definitely blew us away. The atmosphere was cozy, quaint and well-styled. The staff was helpful, attentive and fun. The music was honestly the best playlist I've ever heard in a restaurant. The food was delicious and special. Cannot recommend this awesome spot enough!!!!"}
{"text":"Best waitress on the planet!  Pretty presentation, yummy on the tongue, nice sized portions, good value.  Love the brick walls, quaint atmosphere and space around the tables.  We go here at least twice a year when we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"I don't think I've given a five star review before.  Ever.   But this place warrants it.  The thing that makes it great is that the staff seemed to really care about the work they were doing and the food they brought out.   At our table, for apps we had a special duck confit salad (which seems like it's a fairly common special), and fried smelt. Both were awesome in their own right.  Especially the salad, which may qualify as life-changing.  

Entrees were roasted cod, squid ink risotto with various shellfish, roasted seabass with a creamy sweet potato topper, and a basic kids pasta, which in reality was a tasty tagliatelle pomodoro. 

Excellent wine selection, if a bit pricey.  We had a few off the by-the-glass menu which were delicious.  

To seal the deal, we had the chocolate lava cake and tiramisu.  Both were delicious.  We finished off with some Taylor Fladgate 10 year old Porto, which is always nice.  A decent selection of after-dinner drinks if that is your thing.      

As others have written, the portions here are not big.  They are appropriately sized to give you a delicious and fulfilling meal.  If you want to strap a feedbag on your face, you can try Buffalo Wild Wings or something.  We took our time and we never felt rushed.  On a Sunday night, they turned away at least 25 people.  They could've tried to move the tables, but that never happened."}
{"text":"If I had this place down the street I think I would stop in weekly! The decor and ambiance is that perfect touch of European rustic/farm. This small restaurant also has a great selection of wine by the glass at affordable prices, and although a little expensive, nothing on the menu disappointed."}
{"text":"Best place I have been to in Montreal. The atmosphere is so cozy, real, and authentic. Can't wait to come back. The service is amazingly friendly."}
{"text":"There are not enough words in the English or French dictionary to sum up our feelings about Bocata Restaurant and Wine Bar.  We plan random visits to Montreal just so we can eat there!  This is one of those rare restaurants you discover and everything about it just stays with you.  We love the food, the wine and the staff--especially Andreane! 

Bocata is my favorite restaurant in Montreal and possibly the world!  Every meal I've had has been memorable.  Here are some of my favorite dishes:

Citrus Risotto with Scallops, Verbena Emulsion
Don't let the foam fool you!  These scallops were sooooo good!  We got to try these from the Valentine's Day Menu and they should be the everyday menu.

Lobster & Fennel Tagliatelle
We had no problem eating off of other people's dishes to try this delicious dish.  We just pretended there were no carbs.  This goodness is on the summer menu so you need to get it while you still can!

Mediterranean Sea Bass
This is also part of the summer menu.  You can lose a friendship over this one if you don't feel like sharing.  The vanilla infused sweet potato puree was perfect.

Burata
A featured appetizer on the summer menu.  The Burata is quite filling and tasty!  Don't worry, the bread doesn't have any carbs.

Asparagus with Quail Eggs
Had dreams about the asparagus.  There is truffle oil in there somewhere.  We went two days in a row just to eat this again.

Foie Gras Poele Aux Argumes
Okay, we love our foie gras but this one really changed our lives.  Orange marmalade  Bourbon and Maple jus and GINGERBREAD CRUMBLE.  To our Foie Gras Fairy Godmother or Godfather out there, we are willing to sacrifice a lot just to have a taste again. 

Amuse Bouche
Although this was just an amuse bouche, we knew that the rest of our meal would be perfect because they got this part right!

Surf & Turf 
So what do you get when you pair AAA Angus Beef Tenderloin with celery root puree and Roasted Lobster with Almond & Truffle Viennoise?  The perfect pair!

Sweet Treat
Warm chocolaty brownies with salted caramel and ice cream.  What more can a girl ask for?  And yes, the dessert had zero carbs as well.


We are just so in love with Bocata Restaurant et Bar a vin all we can say is Oh My Bocata!  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Perfect to grab a glass of wine or five and read a book while watching the crowds in Old Montreal! The food is fresh and the Burrata is the best I've ever had! Mitch is the Sommelier and has impeccable taste in wine. His rotating wine list is exceptional. If you want to try them a they pour 1/2 glasses as well. Julia is a phenomenal waitress and makes you feel right at home! All this with a great old world ambience. You really can't go wrong. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Bocata... What a fantastic meal! One of the rare 5 star reviews. 

The service is great. The decor is cozy and very nice.

We had a bit of everything:
Pata negra: freshly cut and fabulous! 
Pan con tomate: tasty and fresh.
Crab croquette: plenty of excellent crab, no fillers.
Duck salad: very good with many flavours going on.
Tuna tartare: absolutely fabulous!!!! I am still thinking about how good it was! My favourite part of the meal. 
Lobster roll: very good, but the side corn and cheese salad was not really to our taste.
Lobster carbonara: very good. 

If I had one criticism, for the sake of criticizing something, it would be a little too much mayo in the lobster roll. 

I will be going back... Can't wait! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We ate here twice during our stay in Old Montreal because it was that fantastic!  Definitely recommend sitting at the bar and watching the staff make their fantastic cocktails!  Try their cocktail of the day and an English mojito!!  For starters, we had the duck confit salad (best salad I've ever, ever had), octopus and arugula salad, oysters, pata negra (it's almost like prosciutto but less salty and smoother), and burrata (almost a cross between cream cheese, sour cream and mozzarella, a must have for cheese lovers).  For dinner we had the black cod and the veal shank with gnocchi and buffalo mozzarella, both were absolutely outstanding.  For dessert, we had the tiramisu and wished we could lick the bottom of the jar it came in.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu and if you have questions the staff is happy to explain anything.  We love wine but aren't quite connoisseurs yet, so we asked for recommendations based on what we do know we like and we were not disappointed with what they brought out for us."}
{"text":"Loved the warm homey atmosphere. We got the tuna tartare as our entree and then I had the veau with homemade gnocchi. The tuna was amazing. The veau was quite fatty but once you cut around that the meat was delicious. The gnocchi melted in your mouth and the piece de resistance was the fresh buffalo mozzarella they added to it. Great glass of Bordeaux wine that was only $5. We sat at the bar where the staff was attentive and friendly. 

My only complaint was I am only 5'4 so there wasn't anywhere that I could comfortably reach to rest my feet as we sat at the bar."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last night with my mother. It was such a pleasant experience! The waitress was very kind, and took the time to explain various plates to us. We split the salmon appetizer which was so delicate and refreshing. We both had the lobster roll. Super delicious! The waitress gave us a complimentary dessert which also hit the spot. I highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice on trips to Montreal and both times had outstanding meals.  The food has always been well prepared.  The atmosphere is perfect for a special night out.  Cozy and eclectic...this restaurant is a little pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"We arrived without reservation, but luckily grabbed a table for two by the bar. This restaurant is tastefully decorated and not lacking for details. Out server greeted us and let us know the sommelier was present should we have any questions. This a tapas-style restaurant and our server suggested 2-4 plates a person. The two of us shared three plus a bottle of wine and dessert and were definitely satisfied. Our first two plates were a variety of five tomatoes with truffle oil and the duck and arugula. Both were absolutely fantastic! To follow we had the beef cheek. I dont have words to describe this dish. The beef was melt-in-your mouth delicious while the sauce it came with begged to be sopped up by bread which soon followed - two types to be precise. 
Our dessert (although not necessary) was a strawberry shortcake. This dish was just ok, but it did have to follow those beef cheeks. I would have had those for dessert.
Overall, I would recommend this restaurant, but be sure to make a reservation to avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"We wanted a delicious but laid back dinner, and we scored at Bocata! We were able to go without a reservation on a Wednesday night. We started with the special appetizer- panzanella. The tomatoes were delicious, but the dish was too salty. The buratta was very good- it's served with anchovies (which I personally don't like but my wife does!). 
The halibut special main course was amazing! Perfectly cooked fish over asparagus and ricotta- yum! Our server was super friendly, and the restaurant is so cute and cozy."}
{"text":"I am not sure was it me or the food was not all that. We went there for brunch and there was only limited choices to chose from. We were group of 12 and no one liked their food."}
{"text":"We had dinner here for the very first time.  Decor is warm, homey, rustic, hip & eclectic.
Candles in the fireplace & on the tables.   Wait staff very enthusiastic.  Food is unique & fabulous.  I had sea bass with a salad of lentils & beans.  Bread is fantastic too.  Dessert was the best lemon merange ever in tart form.  Only downside is noise level.  Located in Vieux Montreal on a cobblestone street - quaint."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great vibe, great music! What else can I say? Everything was great!  Hubby had squid ink risotto with squid and scallops. I had lobster carbonara with bits of lardon. Such a laid back vibe with great music."}
{"text":"First time in Montreal, stumbled upon this place by accident for dinner with my family. The ambience and decor were adorable and intimate. The food was incredible and so fresh. We shared fried smelts as an appetizer (must try) and I had a glass of Riesling and the thyme roasted seabass as an entree. Service was great as well, would be a romantic date spot!"}
{"text":"The concierge at Hotel Gault recommended Bocata, and I'm glad he did--I don't think I would have tried it given the lack of Yelp coverage. We had a great experience: relaxed, intimate room, friendly service, and a great sommelier who imports small-batch wines from France. The portions are between tapas and a regular entree. My wife and I split five between us, and were happy. The oysters were fantastic, as was the Halibut and heirloom tomato salad. The short rib and filet, and the carbonara were very good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We dined here for our 15 year wedding anniversary. Good thing the weather was bearable because the restaurant was open air & I wasnt expecting that otherwise I would've dressed a little lighter. The service was fantastic! The girl that waited on us was very informative and attentive. We were welcomed with two glasses of bubbly. We ordered the burrata w/ white anchovies & shaved summer truffle. We didn't taste a hint of truffle. The serving was plenty but I wouldn't order that again. My husband order the pork chop & I ordered the lobster carbonara. The portion on the carbonara was pretty small which I should watch my portion size anyways but with the small amount of lobster in it (I counted 3 small pieces) it shouldn't have been $30. Each dish we had the sommelier paired wine by the glass which they had us sample first before selecting & that was great! For dessert we had the lemon meringue torte, the lemon filling & meringue was great but we didn't care for the puff pastry it was on, it was too hard to cut through. All in all I loved the ambiance but would maybe come back for a bottle of wine to share with appitizers & dessert."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this restaurant is super charming and the service was great. My husband and I had some wine, split the Burrata, beef tartare, and octopus appetizers and he ordered the lobster roll and I got the squid ink risotto. The burrata was amazing and was from a local farm and served with anchovies and warm bread - delicious! The octopus was just ok. It was seasoned with paprika and served with potatoes and an aioli sauce. It was not Bad but nothing memorable either. The beef tartare was good, but the chunks of beef were bigger than typical for tartare and seasoning very European but yummy. the squid ink risotto was so/so. It's a heavy dish and was mixed with some sort of aioli sauce and came with cherry tomatoes peas seafood and chorizo. The seafood/meat was all good but the risotto pasta was undercooked and sauce was very heavy and too rich. My husband like the lobster roll - said It was good but not great. Overall food is good, and ambiance is great. I personally would not return for the food but loved the charm of the restaurant's atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Stumbled in here searching for brunch and it was a hidden gem. The ambience and decor were very cute and comfortable. The food was diverse and creative for brunch and portioned perfectly."}
