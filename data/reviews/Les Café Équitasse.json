{"text":"The only reason I would see to come here is the fact that they have ample comfy couches to come and enjoy your tiny coffees and teas.  The iced latte was mediocre and the taro bubble tea was ok.  Sizes here are a lot smaller than what I'm use to.  The medium here is the equivalent to a small back in New York City so you may feel a tad ripped off.  Anyway, it has AC, it has wifi, plenty of comfy couches and the staff is polite."}
{"text":"Spacieux et confortable meme si un peu vieillissant. Tres bon iced latte. Gateaux corrects, meme si pas homemade"}
