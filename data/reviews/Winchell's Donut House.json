{"text":"These donuts are the best around.  I drive \"past\" Krispy Kreme almost every time I go to Winchells.  Their donuts are tastier, larger and staff is always friendly.  Next going to try a sandwich, but, will save room for a donut!"}
{"text":"The woman here is really not nice at all. It always feels like she trying to just give me my food and get me out. She doesn't say anything besides what she had to like taking my order. No word after she takes my card."}
{"text":"The main baker there at night not only keeps a great variety of donuts available, but he is entertaining. It must be hard to works as hard as bakers do and stop what your doing to help people who sometimes take forever to choose (ok ...I'm talking about myself) and still greet them with a smile and even joke about the total at the register. this place has never been a disappointment. yeah they are just donuts but when they are warm and fresh...fugget-about-the--diet!!"}
{"text":"Winchells has the best donuts in my opinion. Theres nothing special about this particular shop. There chillas are my favorite though :)"}
{"text":"Breaking my no-chain-reviews rule once again, it was just nice that after a piss-poor experience at Umami Burger, we found the exact opposite when stopping in for some late night donuts at Winchell's. The crew is always smiling and the donuts are still fresh even in the late hours. There's not much to say, really. The donuts are tasty and the service is pleasant. That's all you really need to succeed.  Certain places should take a look and revisit their policy."}
{"text":"Went here for a breakfast croissant. It was pretty good and made the eggs and croissant were both fresh. I will be getting it again soon.  I didn't like the donuts though still too much bread and I have a palate for Krispy Kreme.  All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"I don't know what these people's problem is. They got signs all over their fucking restaurant it's a they have sandwiches they have oatmeal that other things aside from Donuts but when I go in there and ask for a donut the idiot behind the counter doesn't understand what I mean when I ask for a fucking sandwich. So then I asked if he had anything else but Donuts. He said yes I asked what he said Donuts. But I said I didn't want donuts and I told him that then I asked him again do you have anything but Donuts right now. And he said again yes we have Donuts I don't want donuts I said we went back and forth like this for nearly 15 goddamn minutes because this guy was too stupid to understand that I didn't want fucking Donuts the only reason I came to this place it's because it's the only goddamn place here that's open. And their advertising all over the place that they have things other than donuts and it says right on that advertisement served all day. But this guy refused to sell me anything but Donuts. This type of customer service is flat-out unacceptable."}
{"text":"Darn you Winchells for being 24 hours and having a good selection of doughnuts always on standby. I went yesterday for my usual apple fritter and cinnamon roll and to my surprise I selected a Pumpkin cake doughnut. Wholly moly was it delicious- moist with just enough allspice and nutmeg! Sadly, I didn't turn around and grab the other 3, but I went today and they were all sold out! I shed a small tear, because that's my luck so I grabbed two regular glazed and polished them off instead."}
{"text":"I like the guys they r always nice and friendly, the donuts are always. Fresh always the best place for a midnight snack."}
{"text":"24/7 donuts, bagels, coffee, and sandwiches- what more could you ask for?! Service is quick, fast, and usually bilingual. The bagel sandwiches are a favorite of mine, as well as their iced hazelnut coffee.   If you need to grab breakfast for your work squad, call ahead for a discount: the Winchell's dozen (14 assorted glazed and filled donuts, bars, and twists) is entirely customizable and regularly $10, but calling ahead with a large order has saved me a few bucks, thanks to friendly management.   But I keep coming back for the sandwiches: $5 for a bagel sando packed with fresh toppings, add a dollar for chips and a drink. The turkey is my go-to, but the BLTCC (BLT + cream cheese) is a tasty indulgence too, if you opt for savory over sweet. Note that the bagels themselves are not of stellar quality- they can be a bit hard (rather than chewy) even when they're not toasted."}
{"text":"Always consistent always great donuts and great service. Sometimes fancy donuts are complicated and over done to cover up for an inferior product.  These are good old fashioned, consistently superior donuts. Try the latest fad, but come back here for the tried and true!"}
{"text":"Where this place lacks bagel variety it makes up in service, taste, cost, and accessibility. Open 24 hours 7 days a week I pop in and always greeted warmly. Food is super fresh and everything tastes awesome. I recommend this place for your doughnut and breakfast needs"}
{"text":"I tried to give them a chance more then once and they still mess my order up. I was there about 5 minutes ago, and it was super busy with one person at 7am. Been waiting 15 minutes and he finally came to me, and I told him I I wanted a sausage, egg, cheese on a bagel, and the other one cheese and egg. He did the opposite. He made ham, egg and cheese and didn't do the other sandwich. I told him I didn't say ham and he had the nerve to peal it off in front of me. Smh I'm never coming came here. This is the 3rd time they messed up an order and overcharged me for three sandwiches last time. You guys suck I'm sorry."}
{"text":"This location has a racist Hispanic  working at this location. I asked to use the restroom and he said it was out of order. So I left. I asked a friend of mine with me that happens to be Hispanic  him self if he would go ask. He had his Hispanic children ask in Spanish to use the restroom. With no hesitation he gave them the keys to use it. I wish I would have video taped this so I can slap a lawsuit on them for racism. I Will never buy donuts from them again."}
{"text":"Pretty bad experience for me. I went in & 2 guys were working, one who didn't speak English. The other guy was just standing there & when I asked for help he pointed at the guy who didn't speak English. (Keep in mind no one else was there). The guy charged me on my card, said it didn't go thru, & asked for me to pay cash. I checked my bank statement & it showed that it charged me. So not only did they charge my card but they were trying to take my cash too. $10 for a half dozen which would've been $20 if I didn't check my bank statement.   PS the guy who knew how to speak English knew how to do everything wasnt doing anything. & the \"cronas\" we're pretty stale  Just overall bad experience. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I have been enjoying Winchells since the early 1980s. This location does the franchise justice with perfect maple bars, apple fritters, and glaze twists. The donuts are moist and have a balance to their sweetness that you won't get at other donut conglomerates."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here.  Good array of donuts.  While it wasn't anything special, quality was acceptable, and we got there early in the AM so everything seemed fresh.  Friendly service, even though we were the only people in the store speaking English.  We sat and ate a donut in the clean and bright in-store eating area, then took the rest of the dozen to meet up with family.  Everyone was happy with their donut and no complaints."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The ladies that have helped me are so helpful and so nice. The service is the best. They make me want to come back. The smell of doughnuts is amazing and I can see someone baking in the back. The doughnuts are always so fresh and delicious. I was there yesterday morning. I messed up ordering my coffee but Lily was so nice about fixing it for me. No attitude only great customer service."}
{"text":"Wanted some donuts and debated for awhile on where to go. I decided to try this location, and was very satisfied. The donuts were big in size, looked very yummy and tasted delicious. The price was right @$8.99 a doz ( their doz comes with 14) made me even happier, but what was even greater is the excellent customer service. I will certainly make here my only stop for donuts!"}
{"text":"Winchells Donuts is the definition of guilty pleasure for me and gets all 5 stars.  Located interestingly in Chinatown, this donut shop is open 24/7. This Winchells keep a great assortment of fresh donuts on hand at all hours of the day. In addition there are some nice breakfast sandwiches, bagels, and coffee based drinks if you are looking for something a little less sweet.  Though it may seem off to comment on the service of a donut shop, the staff working here seems to really enjoy their jobs. The older gentleman working late nights is fun to talk to and has a great attitude towards his customers.  There is really nothing I can complain about, great donuts, friendly service and a convenient location."}
{"text":"It's refreshing to get excellent customer service. The folks working at this winchells seem genuinely happy to be working there. Who doesn't love service with a smile?"}
{"text":"Like a crackhead chasing the dragon, they got me on the come back. I find myself coming back for their breakfast bagels. This Winchell's is almost on the way to work, so I've been frequenting this place for a couple of weeks now.   I ended up going here to pick up some donuts for work because I over slept. I'm really glad my ass was late that day. I get two dozen donuts for the heads at work and I pick up an egg, ham, and cheese in a sesame bagel. Simple and solid. The sesame bagel sets this breakfast sandwich off. I've also tried their chorizo in a sesame bagel.  Also very tasty.  Winchell's still has my favorite donuts and now my favorite breakfast sandwich.   EYE LIKA!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff on Saturday late morning.  I ventured off to this donut shop on another one of my cheat day Saturday's and I enjoyed the bear claw, raspberry filled, lemon filled, twists, chocolate bar, maple peanut glaze! I'm all about the Fritters though. I wasn't impressed with the one I received but I ate it anyway. This was the first time I got donuts from this location."}
{"text":"Great donuts and service. We always go there when we are in Las Vegas. We really need a store in Laughlin or Bullhead"}
{"text":"I went here this morning to get my sons football team some doughnuts for after the game.  I came here in a hurry and they helped me right when I walked through the door.  The staff was smiling the whole time and happy to help me with my order.  They didn't have a big selection since it was so early In the morning, so he threw in a few extra free ones to make up for it.  The doughnuts were really yummy and the team loved them.  It's a little ways from my house but I would be willing to make the drive for great customer service and doughnuts in the future."}
{"text":"After attempting to purhase a double dozen at Krispy Kreme and they advised  me no glazed due to the machine was broken I headed directly over to this location.  Winchell's donut's are bigger and have more density which I feel tops KK. Anyway, I ended up coming in two mornings back to back for the Winchell's dozen.   My clients were happy!"}
{"text":"Yummm! Fresh with many choices.. open 24/7. Their cake donuts are delish. Wasn't a fan of the chocolate bar because it was on the dry side but the others were great. $4.99 for half dozen. Craving crushed !!"}
{"text":"winchell's is a dying breed. with krispy kreme & dunkin donuts poppin up all over las vegas there aren't many left but the make the largest, freshest and cheapest donuts around. great coffee too! they usually give kids a free donut or some donut holes."}
{"text":"I waited a few minutes at the counter to be helped at about 2:30 pm. I knocked on the counter. I shouted hello?!  I shouted louder. I walked out and walked back in. Finally someone came to the counter from the back. I shouldn't have to work this hard to give you money."}
{"text":"Jose treated me like family. I will never forget the kindness I was shown nor the deliciousness of the donuts. My bae and I were very pleased. GIVE JOSE A RAISE!!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! Can't believe I didn't know about this place! Just had best donut ever. I will surely come back. Hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Donuts have become very popular lately. So it nice to see a shop that reminds me of when I was a kid. The Donuts are great and it's a nice quiet place to get a bite in the busy environment of Las Vegas! Also the prices are still fair!"}
{"text":"I freaking love donuts, especially Winchell's. I'm a cake donut fiend. I developed an addiction to their toasted bagel sandwiches in California, so imagine my dismay when I moved to Las Vegas to find that most Winchell locations are godforsaken hybrids--half Subway, half donut, no toasty bagelwiches.   Well, then I found you, Winchells Donuts on Jones Blvd. The only one in Vegas that boasts a full sandwich menu. Nothing beats an egg, cheese, and jalapeño bagel at 2 am.   I give in to my donut cravings late at night, so I can't comment on the day staff, but the night employees don't speak a lick of English. It doesn't bother me, but I can see how it could be frustrating to some people. They're nice peeps, though. They also are good at baking the cakey donuts that have a little crunch on the bottom and are all dense and fluffy in the middle--y'know what I'm saying? Also have a nice selection even late at night. I can always get my sprinkles ON!"}
{"text":"I got a sandwich to go.  It was packed in a Styrofoam box.  Hard to eat as it fell apart.  Also not environmentally friendly.  I'll stick to Dunkin Donuts."}
{"text":"The best donuts in Vegas..last night I had their french crullers..and they were melt in your mouth..wow!  I got my donut fix!"}
{"text":"No other donuts compare!! They are simply the best. Their dozens r cheaper than most places and I think include 2 extra donuts. I love coming here every morning for my coconut glazed and a cup of coffee. The gentleman with black curly hair is so polite and attentive. Always in a positive mood, def what people need in the am."}
{"text":"I went to the Winchell's on N. Decatur.  Not the best part of town so you might want to consider that if going here.  Service was friendly, place was clean.  Hadn't been to a Winchell's in a long time so bought a dozen (yes, their dozen is actually 14 which is nice).  Tried their cinammon buns, didn't like them.  They taste more like apple fritters than cinammon (couldn't taste any cinammon at all ). I'll stick with grocery store cinammon rolls and skip the Winchells.  (they are large, but tasteless and really nor worth all that dough in your stomach!).  Prices are okay.  The other donuts were very \"meh\" and had a somewhat artificial flavor at times.  They seemed fresh so no complaints there.  I just don't care for winchell's flavors or the \"off\" taste or aftertaste  some of their stuff has.  These are the kind of donuts that would  be okay as a breaktime treat for  a bunch of hungry workers who need a sugar fix or a  crowd  of little kids who  love to gobble  dough and sugar washed down with Kool-Aid. Also, if you're on a budget, the prices won't break your bank like at Krispy Kreme (which I far prefer but can no longer afford).  I won't be going back to Winchell's and will continue to look around for a place with the right combination of flavor, variety and price.  But for what it is and the niche it serves, Winchells is good enough...but I've had way better!"}
{"text":"Better than DD in my opinion. Only having 1 French crueler left when I get there gets you 3 stars instead of 4."}
{"text":"Yes, I just gave this donut house a five star rating.  Winchell's is benefiting from the wave of nostalgia that came over me when I walked in with my pal Matt after dinner at Wendy's Noodle House.  It was already 8:30pm, but the cases were FULL of fresh donuts.  I remember having Winchell's all the time when I was growing up in SoCal and they were everywhere.  I'm sure I've driven by this one, but never stopped in until tonight.  Matt told me they're open 24 hours, too--curses!  I don't need to know that.  He's just paying me back for telling him that Keebler Grasshopper cookies are the same thing as the Girl Scouts' Thin Mints and can be had year-round.  Now we're even.  Four donuts for $2.99 cannot be beat and the memories that Winchell's brings back are priceless."}
{"text":"Service was nice, doughnuts were good too this is a good place for some doughnuts quick but I wouldn't say there my favorite place to get doughnuts"}
{"text":"I honestly thought that all Winchells had closed down years ago, but found this location on Yelp.  I was told by the owner that this specific store is independently owned while the others in Vegas are part of the Winchells chain.  When I was a kid, my dad used to frequent another Winchells and when I was in junior high, there was a Winchells by the local movie theater and that's where my friends and I would stop for our doughnut fix.  Because my parents were regulars, they always brought back twists, apple fritters, and maple bars - so guess what I bought during this trip?  Although, these weren't fresh from the oven (we showed up around 4pm), the donuts were still soft and super tasty.  They weren't overly sweet and perfect with a cup of coffee.  I left myself half of the apple fritter for breakfast the next morning and it was still soft and delicious.  There's something about their dough that I find perfect for my taste buds and the texture is always soft and slightly chewy.  I will always love Winchells and if I ever have kids, best believe that they'll be Winchells lovers too!"}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service!! Great variety of donuts and breakfast foods AND open 24 hours!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Smells really good outside of Winchells. Got a half dozen for only $5. Donuts look fresh and delicious. Hope they taste as good as they look."}
{"text":"I have been to this Winchell's on quite a few occasions since my initial review. I always end up here in the evening when most other donuts in the area are already closed.  The donuts have always been fresh and the service is always so friendly. The guys who work here are so nice, I really have to hand it to them."}
{"text":"This place came in handy when i needed it. Was sick with the flu for a few days and when i craved something that just happened to be donuts at 10pm at night these guys were open and saved the day. Delicious donuts, fast and friendly service! Greatly appreciated."}
