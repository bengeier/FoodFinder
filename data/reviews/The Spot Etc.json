{"text":"I love the spot best to go on a Sunday very good chicken and fresh fries! Food takes a while to come out but theses usually a ton of other orders ahead of you. Once you taste the chicken you'll understand it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials. The chicken is my favorite. I wish they would bring back their chicken and waffles I would be there every weekend for brunch. The atmosphere is safe and friendly. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"New to Pittsburgh I've  made this place my Friday night hangout place.  Great LIVE music, and a very hospitable crowd.  The decor is as old school as the music that they play, if you're there for the music you'll be fine.  As a dude I was also impressed by the beautiful woman.  Be foreWarned at around 9pm the crowd begins to change--  younger hip hop crowd arrives for the hip hop scene. Best time to exit the building."}
{"text":"Went to The Spot last night to pick up take out order of wings...Uh uh uh...delicious! Also, my sister introduced me to Dave, the owner. Great spot Dave n the wings were fabulous! Thinking about going back today"}
{"text":"I've ordered the chicken wings twice thus far.  They are fried just right but are a little too salty for my liking.  I'm not sure if they are following a \"recipe\" or if the cook is just heavy handed with the season salt, but try them for yourself ! Oh, and you only get the $0.50 deal if you eat in!"}
