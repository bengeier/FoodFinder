{"text":"Notre premiere visite fut sensas! Nous avions pris un delicieux homard au gingembre avec riz gluant, un tilapia a l'aubergine puis un chow mein cantonnais.
C'est un \"Apportez votre vin\", donc on a savoure notre soiree!"}
{"text":"Lobster with sticky rice is over priced. The service is super slow and the ambience doesn't match the price they charge. Had way better chinese from in this area."}
{"text":"Fed up of the trite fare at Winncie's, I decided to try out the newly renovated Maison Sai Yan.   The most I can say about the mains is that they were not too disappointing. The imperial rolls were very tasty, and were accompanied by a delicious oil-based sauce (not of the plum or sweet-and-sour variety that most places throw at you).  More importantly, for those of you who swear by Winncie's \"won ton\" soup, after you taste Sai Yan's soup, which is flavourful and enticing, you'll swear that Winncie's is serving you tepid water with over-boiled noodles.

Although I wasn't blown away by the food, I'm definitely switching over to this restaurant. The food here even got my partner (a previously loyal Winncie's fan) to toss out their menu and replace it for Sai Yan's.  I believe that speaks for itself.  Now, whether the General Tao is better or not is yet to be discovered..."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food in the surrounding area. Worth the money. Would love to rate this to 5 star if the server give a friendlier service."}

{"text":"Amazing Pekin duck :-) Will be back, but will only order halves to get just pancakes.
Otherwise they mix up the rest of the duck meat in a Chow Mein and we kist live the pancake style :)"}
{"text":"I got an egg roll which was small but okay, a won ton soup that was okay and a cantonese chow mein that was very dissapointing...  If the food was more appreciable that place could be a hit since you can bring your wine.... But i'd rather go to Kam Fung, nearby, which is far much better quality and taste wise."}
{"text":"Be aware: only order from the menu if you don't want to get ripped off. Two of us ordered two specialties recommended by the waitress. Lobster costs almost 60 dollars and lamb chops, which were overcooked and as tough as leather, cost about forty dollars. Overall, dinner for two was 135 including tips and tax. WHAT A RIP OFF!!!"}
{"text":"First time here...Monday night...not a lot customer ..we ordered the special lobster sticky rice..it was very delicious!!big portion!!and the service is very friendly!!we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Let's just say that there's better Asian restaurants out there... The food looks standard but the taste makes me wonder what the quality of their meats actually is. It's quite salty so it's hard to say if it tastes good. I went here on a Monday night (what I assume after a busy weekend) so there should have been good turnover.  It's busy enough with most tables filled but for myself it wasn't the best in Cantonese-styled dining. A previous experience here was better, probably a different day, a different chef, a different set of dishes altogether. Most people liked the lamb, the lobster rice, and a couple other speciality dishes, but who knows, maybe their chef's changed. This time, I had more typical dishes like sweet n sour pork, beef and mixed vegetables, lotus root and pork, etc. I suppose one redeeming quality is the BYOW/BYOB policy. Don't expect too much in terms of decor either, it's functional more than fine dining.  If you come here with *** expectations you won't be disappointed, perhaps pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place but was quite disappointed. Considering that the best part of the meal was the tea, it is safe to say that I won't be going back. Service was average and the prices were extremely affordable."}
{"text":"I went there for a Chinese's new year supper. They specialize more on seafood. I definitely recommend the lobster with sticky rice."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something authentic, something that resembles a home cooked Chinese meal in Montreal, then I highly recommend you to check this place out. Petit, and unpretentious, this restaurant offers an experience that is increasingly becoming rare in a word where you are paying for the decir rather than the food. Now,mind you, I am not saying this is a Zagat/Michelin restaurant masquerading as a hole in the wall. Yet for those of who long for a humble meal, cooked with care, and reminiscent of a meal in a typical Chinese home, this is it. The wait staff are friendly, hardworking folks trying to do their best. The ambience is simple, a good place to have a meal and catch up with friends and family unhindered. All in all a throwback to simpler times."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this restaurant one time because another restaurant we were looking for in Brossard was closed. The waitress named Fong is a really good sales lady cause she upsold us from a 4-course combo meal to razor clams, lobster sticky rice and lamb chops. The food wasn't bad.  The price is a bit high for the presentation and ambiance.  We did come back a second time (on my dad's request, not mine) and we finally did the 4-course meal combo. General Tao, Sweet n Sour fried fish, Lotus root pork and beef & veggies... presentation and flavoring was simply ok.  This is the kind of place if you're trying to find any restaurant that's open on a holiday and manage to find this one, it's better than nothing. It'll satisfy your desire to eat at a restaurant but if you have other choices, this probably won't be the first choice!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant a couple of times and to be honest, the taste is not bad, but the quality is not always stable, for example, I once ordered braised beef, it's cold in the centre and my mom said that the beef was not fresh, so they exchanged it for free and apologized. Yet some other times the food is pretty okay, so yeah, try it or leave it, it's your call!"}
{"text":"Best thing : bring your own booze!

This is the second time in five years that I return here. The food is good and the service is quick and pleasant. Their soupes are really good in particular the hot and spicy. 

One thing that's changed since the last time is the price to portion ratio. A la carte nothing seems worth it. The combos for two are a decent value with the prices ranging from 20 to 30$ per person

They make good general tau chicken with a nice slightly spicy sauce."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! We came here with an open stomach and left with an empty stomach:( 
At first, everything was good. The initial service was good and the menu looked very promising. Since it's been awhile that we haven't been to a Cantonese/Sichuan restaurant we decided on going with our must haves... Won ton soup for two, beef with black been sauce and salt and pepper shrimps with head on (yayyy my favourite and you don't see this everywhere!) and white rice. Hubby wanted to be adventurous and ordered a fried oysters and a sizzling plate for 22,95$!!! Now this is where everything started to fall apart. The won tons were ok but the broth had a funk to it that I can't put my finger on how to describe it to you. The beef was the only good dish that we actually enjoyed hence the two stars rating. The oysters were bland and really not good at all. Now that's 22,95$ down the drain cause this isn't something you can reheat and enjoy the next day. Quite frankly, I just want to throw it out! The shrimp... It came out steamed with a soy based sauce to dip in. I told the waitress right away that this wasn't what I ordered and she basically told me that it was and that it wasn't her fault and to try it out because it's even better then the salt and pepper shrimp. She left the table and that is when my face turned bright red!!! Hubby decided to give it a try and was dissatisfied! She came back and I basically told her that it was unacceptable and that the shrimps were bad. Only then she admitted that she \"might\" of gotten the order wrong ans asked me to not complain to her boss. Now mind you this was an older woman (50's-60's) I felt bad so we ended up just paying and leaving the place. I will NEVER come back here and give it a second chance. Not because the food was so-so. Because the way the waitress tried to pin the mistake on me then trying to make me feel bad for her."}
