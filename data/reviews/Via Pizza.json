{"text":"Little family owned restaurant serving simple but  yummy Italian dishes.
The polenta and wild mushrooms are delicious. A must have.
The pizza is thin and tasty. 
Also had the Tortellini a la Gigi, which was good, but wished the tortellini were fresh.
All in all, really good food in this little quaint restaurant, with friendly service."}
