{"text":"Super fresh seafood in Plaza Midwood - yeah!  They have been selling at the Common Market all summer and now have their own brick and mortar.  We've had so much tasty fish from them in recent months - wreckfish, flounder, shrimp, halibut, tilefish, clams.  The fish is so tasty - you just need a little salt and pepper and that's it. Almost all of it is from the Carolina coast.  Now they're selling Duke's Bread and Dover Farms produce and they're about to team up with Pasta and Provisions!  They've fulfilled my dream of coming home after work and stopping for super fresh local seafood for an incredible dinner. This is one of the best additions to Charlotte in quite some time.  Wishing them lots of success!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Have been 3 times and loved the place more after each trip. I've gotten oysters, which were a great size and only 50 cents a piece! Also, tried the snapper and triggerfish. Both filets were gorgeous and you could taste the freshness. The employees are all super nice and happy to recommend recipes or cooking tips. I won't buy seafood anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Nicest owner of all the seafood markets in a Charlotte. He was very kind and knew exactly what kind of fish I needed to grill out. The fish was very fresh and delicious! I will be a frequent flyer..."}
{"text":"Was in the area and read all of the great reviews here.  I got a pound of shrimp and man they did not disappoint.  Possibly the yummiest shrimp I have ever had.  Ownership was nice and prices are reasonable for what you get, especially compared to other fish markets in town.  Will definitely make this my go to place for seafood."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely LOVE this place! While I have always liked seafood, I actually find myself eating it a lot more now that Catch On is open and literally right down the street from my house. Sometimes I will just drive down there, see what is available and voila! There is dinner. Sean always has a great selection of fresh (not previously frozen crap you find in the case displayed as fresh at Harris Teeter) seafood. A lot of the fin fish is local and their oysters are to die for! Oh, and let's not forget that they also have some fresh chorizo from the local company Grateful Growers. Their prices are actually very good in my mind as the quality can't be beat! Sean is very knowledgable. So, if you see something you have never seen before, he will tell you all about it and how to prepare it. He also said that if you don't see what you want, just ask and they may be able to have it brought it. A true fish monger right in my neighborhood! I have been waiting for this for a long time."}
{"text":"Fresh catch variety everyday? Check. Friendly staff? Check. Special order obscure seafood on the fly and it be reasonably priced and delivered on time? Check. Seriously, this is the seafood provider Plaza Midwood needed."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome addition to the hood.  Loved the seafood we'd grab Saturday on the common market patio.  So glad they got a store.  

Everything i have gotten is super fresh.   I look forward to watching another neighborhood owned business grow before my eyes!!

Kudos and keep it up."}
{"text":"I decided to try this market again.  Once again I was very disappointed in the ratio of fish to everything else.  Now I hear he is thinking of adding an expensive cooler !  Who can afford stone crabs at $32.00 a pound?  Obviously more people than my family.  Not a true fish store.  A gourmet all around high price market, maybe !?!"}
{"text":"Being from New England, I am picky about my seafood. This place is a great find. Great selection of fresh sustainable fish. The owners are super nice and helpful. Only place I will buy fish in Charlotte. Has lots of connections to vendors in Alaska, Boston and can get lobsters from Portland ME...'nough said."}
{"text":"Seafood is absolutely top notch.  Sean is friendly and knowledgable.  Check out the sushi grade salmon.  It's like butta'"}
{"text":"Great shop! Have been here twice and had a wonderful experience both times. The service is wonderful and attentive and better yet the fish is great quality! Excited to keep trying different seafood options!"}
{"text":"Why havn't I tried these guys yet.  Amazing looking fish for not incredibly outrageous prices.

I knew I was in the right place the second I walked in the door and noticed a little Grateful Dead playing in the background.  No fishy smell what-so-ever.  Everything was clearly priced on the board and my fish monger was more than happy to tell me all about what wreckfish or any other offering was.

The wreckfish I ended up buying was awesome.  I wish I had asked for thinner cuts and gotten 2 instead of the one thick one.  It took a little longer than expected to cook all the way through.  A thick fatty grouper is really the only way I can explain it.

I will back back, and back often.  Harris Teeter doesn't compare, and the other higher end fish markets just seem a little overpriced to me."}
{"text":"Great people, great fish, good prices.  Join the email list.  They do a wonderful job keeping you informed every time they bring in seasonal offerings as well as the daily haul.  I'm addicted to this place!"}
{"text":"The wife and I have been customers of Catch On since they opened. I used to pass by twice every day to and from work waiting for them to open. There were maybe a few growing pains as they got things running, but now it's a well oiled machine. Great local fish and shrimp from the Carolina coast as well as some awesome north east delicacies like jumbo scallops and Nova Scotia halibut. East and west coast oysters at $1 a piece with specials  for 50 cents on Wednesdays. They source out the best in seafood products from the pastrami smoked salmon to the smoked mussel and scallops from Maine. Everyone that I've interacted with is very knowledgeable about seafood and ready to make recommendations.

They also have some great local products on hand from pasta and provisions and dukes bread. They even sell beef from a local farm. Catch On seafood is a great addition to the neighborhood. I really don't buy fish anywhere else anymore."}
{"text":"This place has become a Sunday staple (if not more often) in our house. But you better go early as they tend to sell out. And understandably so! Fish is always fresh with typical choices like tuna and salmon to different fish such as wreckfish! The owners are very knowledgable and always know just the right way to cook all the fish selections! Glad to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Catch On offers a new selection of freshly caught seafood every single day.  This place is amazing!  Not sure how to cook wahoo, grouper, lionfish, etc.?  Have no fear - Sean and his team will talk you through the selections available and offer preparation ideas.  

Every Tuesday they offer fish taco kits - swing by for everything you need to prepare delicious fish tacos.  Oyster fan?  Consider your world changed as of right now.  Catch On offers $1 oysters from all over the country -- except on Wednesday when they're only 50 cents!  You cannot beat that! 

Find Catch On on Facebook and sign up for the daily newsletter. Not only will you know what's available each day, but you also learn about a variety of fish, fishing seasons, and great recipes."}
{"text":"Tried Catch-On for the first time tonight and already regretting all those missed years of living in Charlotte and not coming here! The freshest, most delicious Mahi I've ever cooked at home! There were plenty of options and everything looked SO good. The guys working there were super nice and helpful. Can't recommend this place highly enough, we WILL be back :)"}
{"text":"I just stopped in here for the first time today, even though I have driven past it a million times.  I got a couple salmon filets and some of the pastrami smoked salmon (DELISH!). Everything is super fresh and I can't wait to take advantage of the 50 cent oyster night.  I met the owner, Sean, and he was great! Super friendly and helpful - I will definitely be back. The fish blows nasty Harris Teeter fish out of the water :)"}
{"text":"I came in today and got the wahoo (1lb) taco Tuesday kit for only $16! Great, friendly service.  All the seafood looked amazing and they always have a great seasonal selection of a variety of fish you can't get anywhere else. I hate that it took me so long to get here. I certainly will not be going back to any grocery store for my seafood needs!  Also be sure to sign up for the emails so you know the specials and get recipes!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this market for fresh seafood. The interior is clean  and the owner is very knowledgeable and friendly.  In my opinion, customer service is almost as important as the product, the service here was superb."}
{"text":"Best fresh seafood  in Charlotte. We are regular customers and I wouldn't think of getting our seafood anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"A++. 5 stars. 2 thumbs up. A rave review for Catch On! My husband and I are quite particular about our seafood. Quality is everything, and price is a close second. Catch On has become our reliable source for fresh, FRESH, delicious seafood. You can't go wrong with anything. We haven't tried any of the other local provisions as seafood is a primary driver to visit, but it's on our list to do. We've had oysters, scallops and a wide variety of delicious fresh fish. Pumped to have them in the Plaza Midwood 'hood. Plus... The prices are very reasonable. Very thankful for this. We have the coast at our finger tips now and we couldn't be happier! Go check them out and subscribe to their daily newsletter. A must."}
{"text":"I NOW HAVE A NEIGHBORHOOD SEAFOOD MARKET! I kept walking by what I thought was a sports bar at the corner of Commonwealth and Pecan. BUT NO - turns out it's an actual seafood market. Sean has on hand fin fish, oysters, scallops, mussels, shrimp - all very fresh. Put your name on their email list for what they have available as well as specials (such as 50 cent oyster day.) Do not expect bargain basement prices but keep in mind what it takes to get seafood brought in to Charlotte from all along the Atlantic coast without freezing. Last night my son and I enjoyed some wreckfish brought in from Charleston. It was wonderful. A neighbor had their oysters at a party last Saturday - sweet, sweet.
Support our newest neighbors - they do a good job at Catch On Seafood."}
{"text":"Fresh sustainable fish, local produce and goods, and the owner, Sean, and his wife are great to chat with and are super helpful. Same quality as Fresh Catch but priced much more reasonably.   Come in for Tacos Tuesdays (get all the fixings you need for tacos right there) or 50 cent oysters...or pick up some delicious infused olive oil with 25 year aged balsamic.  This whole market is filled with delicious options."}
{"text":"Was visiting a friend in Chantilly the other day and I decided to check this shop out. What a find! I was thrilled with the variety and excellent service. I ended up selecting a \"wreck fish\" filet to grill on the kamado. Not only did I hear the cool story of this fish I had never heard of before, but I had a great conversation with the fishmonger about the neighborhood. I was excited to see they carry Pasta and Provisions pasta, too, and a nice selection of sauces and spices to season your fresh catch. The fish was extremely fresh, and it was quite yummy! I will definitely add this one to my regular stops!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection, great prices, and friendly service.  We needed this in Plaza Midwood!"}
{"text":"Truly fresh seafood is hard to find around here. Even Publix (which I love) sells fairly crappy fish, as much of it is farm raised. I have horror stories about Harris Teeter's fish. Corner fish markets can't even tell you where half of their stuff comes from. Catch On blows every Charlotte market out of the water. Factor in the fair pricing for fish you'll never see in a market around here, plus the awesomeness of the 2 guys running the market, and it's easy to see this is the best seafood market for miles. The place on Selwyn is like the Kay jewelers of seafood. The one in Ballantyne is run by super nice people. But Catch On is the same high quality, with more perks, for far less. They have [fish] Taco Tuesday. They let you sample award winning smoked salmon, dips, local homemade crackers & breads with 200 year old starters... they spoil you. And their daily newsletter has me going around preaching about the local lionfish invasion and ecosystems.. it's THAT informative.

I'm from New England so seafood is my thing. I purchased lionfish, red drum (bass), salmon and shrimp so far. It was so fresh it tasted like it just came out of the waters. It tasted like home. I'm going back for cod this week. My only complaint is that they didn't advertise. I could've ended my hunt for good seafood months ago"}
{"text":"I love to walk into a local business and see an owner whose passion for what they do shines so brightly. That's how I feel about Sean. 

I don't buy a ton of seafood to cook for myself. Sometimes I find fresh fish counters intimidating. Not here. I can walk in completely clueless, and leave happy. Everyone here is nice and helpful. I feel like Sean knows fish like I know Friends sitcom trivia. (Aka that means he's a certified expert)

Along with fresh offerings of their own, Catch On also supports local businesses and carries products from others. I think one of the coolest things they do here is Taco Tuesday. The kits make 6 tacos. They come with tortillas hand made locally at La Lupita, house made fresh salsa from Three Amigos Mexican Restaurant, taco seasoning from The Savory Spice Shop, mahi mahi, slaw, an avocado, and a lime. Kit is just $16. Steal. You could probably have dinner ready in 10 minutes. 

Yes, this is going to be a little more pricier than your Harris Teeter. But, it's better quality and still comparable and even better priced than a lot of the other seafood places around town. Keep up the good work Sean and crew. Love having you guys just five minutes down the road from my house."}
{"text":"After recently moving to Charlotte, I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw an actual fish market in the neighborhood.  EVERYTHING I have had from Catch On has been fresh, delish, and just downright awesome.  In particular, I love that their rotation changes daily and that they have an excellent selection of west coast oysters.  Everyone that works there is friendly and helpful.  As a strong supporter of locally owned businesses, I am happy to get my dinner from Catch On any day of the week.  Well done guys!"}
{"text":"You know, last fall when I first got turned on to COS, I was duly impressed. I loved the daily emails and scored some great product. THEN, at the end of the shrimping season, they sent out an email advertising the last of the Charleston shrimp for the season and asked for pre-orders. I ordered 6 lbs and went to pick them up. 
1. They were heads-on. Hey, I'm a Charleston girl, so that doesn't freak me out, but it does turn what seems like a great price into a hey-maybe-not-so-much-a-deal deal. 
2.Then, they were rather small...not nearly the count they claimed in the email blast. 
3. Lastly, they were mushy and gross. I ended up throwing away the last two bags in my freezer as they just weren't good. 
Okay, I considered that an anomoly, and kept shopping there. One day I went in to see what was good and purchased a piece of black grouper, thinking I would cook it with a crispy skin. I paid about $32, so it definitely was a treat. 
1. I got it home and it smelled very fishy and felt \"slick\". I washed it thoroughly and then smelled and felt it and judged it to be safe, but was leery. 
2. No crispy skin to be had. IT WAS NOT SCALED. It is nearly impossible to scale a piece of filleted fish. THat is just sloppy and lazy not to scale a fish before you clean it. I had to settle for pan sautéing and throwing away the skin. 
3. It just didn't taste great (probably due to the fact if was not fresh), so we threw most of it away. 
The worst part? I sent a reasonable email to them describing my experience and never got so much as a acknowledgment. That. Is Inexcusable. 
I used to tell everyone about COS. Well, I still do. It's just a different story."}
{"text":"Impressed with the selection, quality, customer service, and prices at Catch On.  I plan to get my fish here any time I am in the Plaza Midwood area.  I've been to Clean Catch and Carolina Fish Market several times, but now that I have discovered Catch On, I plan on using it more than the others."}
{"text":"Love this place! So much awesome, fresh food and everyone is so nice and helpful. Stoked to have this place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great service, solid selection and plenty of non seafood options. Breads and a few pastries complemented the layout and they also had fresh pasta and sauce to go with everything. I was there on a Wednesday which was $.50/oysters so I bought about 2 dozen. I will be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are doing our best to only eat local meat products, which are very hard to find in this area. Since Catch On opened, we have been so excited to get products from them.  We have gotten shrimp from them twice, and it has been excellent every time. I also love that they have a few other local products like pasta, bread, etc. It's nice to be able to walk in and get both in one run. Keep up the good work! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place. They have a great selection and the prices are reasonable for the quality you get. The owner is a very nice guy and really knows his fish. He will give you cooking ideas if you need them. They also stock local eggs, frozen meats, and some various other items. The last time I went in I'd forgotten to pick up lemons at the grocery store and was thrilled to find a basket of free ones by the register. This is an excellent place - great quality fish, great customer service."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!

The availability of good seafood in Charlotte has improved dramatically over the past 5 years with specialty shops opening, Whole Foods and Publix opening, and even Harris Teeter really upping its game.  But Catch On is my top choice for seafood.  

I really like the people who own/operate the establishment.  They are always very friendly and I am happy to support their business.  The quality of the product is outstanding. And the prices relative to the quality are unbeatable.  Clean Catch has great product but the prices are beyond ludicrous.  I was pretty excited when Carolina Fish Market opened up a South Park location.  Their product is very good.  However, it seems that they recently really jacked up their prices.  

The bottom line is that Catch On has the best bang for the buck seafood in town.  I am a regular here and I will continue to be."}
{"text":"So nice to see a local fish market in the area. Always has fresh cuts and fresh shrimp. Extremely nice people. They are also adding some local products to the line-up like breads and produce according to their emails. It's really a tiny place but has exactly what it should have-fresh seafood! I urge you to stop in and take a peek. I have signed up for the daily emails so I can see what they have in and what they can get. I'm going today for a Tuesday taco kit. If you are looking for something they don't have, just ask"}
