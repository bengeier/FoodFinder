{"text":"This place is no good. I went skiing with my friends and had a great time here. Then the next day I went to ski club where we are required to take a lesson. I went to the beginner lesson. They told me I was too good. I went to the next lesson up and the teacher never showed up for that lesson. Some lady talked to me and my ski coordinator from my school and placed me in a more advanced lesson instead of advising me to wait for the next easier lesson to come around. My ski coordinator expressed her uncertainty about this but she seemed unconcerned. The instructor for that lesson seemed annoyed that a beginner like me had been placed in the intermediate lesson, and said that he was annoyed at the lady who put me in the lesson and that she knew nothing about skiing. Needless to say I took a hard fall during the lesson since I wasn't ready for it. I broke my arm and had to have major surgery to fix it. The ski instructor seemed more worried about being sued then helping me, refusing to help me barely at all even though I was in excruciating pain.He was only a junior in high school. What place hires a junior in high school for an instructor? The ski patrol told me it was just a contusion and to wait to go to the doctor. Because of this I walked around for five days with a severely broken arm. Now when we asked for a refund for their mistake, they sent us a gift card that wouldn't even pay for a a half a season of skiing. They are extremely unprofessional and their system is flawed and disorganized. Shame on them for running such a poor excuse for a ski resort."}
{"text":"Boston Mills and Brandywine are nice ski resorts located in the Valley about ten minutes apart from each other. With one exception out in Geauga County, they are the only places to ski in the area. Although the skiing is much better outside of Ohio, these places make the best out of the gentle terrain. Boston Mills has longer hours in general and tends to open a bit earlier in the season than Brandywine. Boston Mills also has the longer vertical drop of the two. However, the lifts are newer and much better at Brandywine than at Boston Mills. I tend to go to Boston Mills more because it is closer to me, but I do like Brandywine though. Brandywine has more trails at 11, compared to Boston Mills' 7. Both resorts are very friendly to beginners and offer plenty of lessons for both skiing and snowboarding. I will say that the food is really bad at both resorts. They are both cafeteria style. The last time I went skiing, I had a cheeseburger and it had to be one of the worst I've ever had. The patty looked like mystery meat and had no flavor at all. New this year is Polar Blast, which is a tubing center adjacent to Brandywine. I haven't been there yet, but I'll update this review when I go. Overall, if you're looking for some winter fun in Northeast Ohio, Boston Mills and Brandywine are great places to spend a few hours.  Update: I have been to Polar Blast and it is awesome! There were about 9 lanes open and about 4 had \"jumps\" on them. You didn't really jump, but they added some excitement. The place was packed when I went on a Friday night. The lanes are longer and taller than the old tubing lanes. If you want to go out and have some winter fun without much hassle, head over to Polar Blast at Brandywine."}
{"text":"The women's snow discovery program is very well organized and well run.  If you have never been on skis or never snowboarded, not to worry.  You will be paired up with similar ability folks in your small group.  And if you are advanced, same thing.  Dixie is a wonderful instructor for beginners...she communicates well, she is patient, and she loves what she does.  And she installs confidence in you.  I am having such a great time learning how to snowboard!"}
{"text":"Small time snowboarding, but the bloody marys at the bar is the BEST I have ever had!!!  They are so good, I would go back just for them!"}
{"text":"I had a great time here. It was my first time skiing.  My instructor, Taggart, was really patient and helpful. He had me down an intermediate hill by the end of the day.  I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"It's Cleveland, Ohio. You can't expect much from these hills. They have a fabulous ski program for kids, Mogul Mites. It's great. I recommend for all of you with little ones. Perfect place to learn before hitting real mountains."}
{"text":"Wanted to get out for the first turns of the season to warm up my legs before heading back home to the mountains of Banff and Lake Louise so I headed out to Boston Mills after work yesterday.  Best thing about this place is the proximity to my house, 30 min drive will get me to this decent little ski hill!  With all the recent snow, I was quite happy with the conditions at Boston Mills (Brandywine wasn't open yet, but probably will be in a couple of days).  Good base, lightly groomed and pretty soft snow for an Eastern hill.  This is a great place to take people who are just starting off learning how to ski or snowboard, lots of families with little kids on the hill who were learning their first turns.  I would highly recommend it just for that purpose alone.  Only A-OK, you say?  yeah, and not because I'm comparing it to my Western resorts....I went after 3:30 when they have reduced lift ticket prices for evening skiing (open until 9:30 most weekdays for the after-work crowd), but with lift ticket and rental I wound up paying $62....for 6 runs on a hill.  This seemed a little outrageous considering one run is green, 2 blue and 3 black but one of the blue runs has a terrain park on it that's covered with teenage snowboarders.  And the \"Black\" rating on those runs is a little suspicious, one of them might actually deserve it...at most resort the other two would probably only qualify for a Blue rating.  Spent 75% of my time on the lifts because the runs are so short, yes, I know Ohio is flat but I doubt I'll be coming back here unless I'm teaching someone to ski....I would probably just make a weekend trip out to a few larger hills that are all within 200 miles of Cleveland to get my \"ski-fix\"."}
{"text":"I was unable to stay long there and I also wasn't able to participate in some of the things that they offered like skiing so the only thing I can give you a reference about is their end or lodges it was very crowded and there were a lot of children even around 9 and 10 at night people seem to have been enjoying themselves so I'm assuming that it is a great place for families they also have equipment that you're able to rent so that you can participate in the activities they have there if you don't have your own I'm not telling anyone to shy away from it I think that everyone should experience it on their own terms and I will go back to see if my first experience was just not as pleasant because of the limited time in capability of doing the activities that I had."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this, It is a great resort IF you have never been out of Ohio. If you have, you realize how tiny and crappy it really is. But hey, for Ohio it is the best in the state. That isn't saying much though. I get a season pass every year anyway though. It is insanely expensive for a crappy resort too. I paid almost 300 dollars for a weekly pass during their SALE! Not much of  sale.... A Holiday Valley pass isn't that much and Holiday Valley is 3 times as nice. The food is standard cafeteria food and the bars are just ok. So what do they actually do well?  Their parks and terrain every year are actually really nice. They have great jumps set up and their boxes and rails are usually really well laid out. As a matter of fact their parks have been my favorite so far. They just nail it. I think they know the hills take a minute to go down so they make sweet board parks. Their late nights and college ID nights are cool too. They also do special events and contest which are actually pretty fun.   So there you have it. Crappy expensive hills but great parks?!"}
{"text":"Pros: -Super easy to park, purchase a day pass, get your equipment, put your stuff in a locker, get on the lift, ski down and repeat.  -Food/Bar had a decent number of selections and was priced well and tasted good. -If you are a beginner, this is a very easy place to ski or learn how to ski. The hill is not very steep or difficult to get down.  -We went on a Thursday and there were not very many people there. There were no waits for the lift and it was easy to get to them from the lodge.   Cons: -For the most past the snow is not real, it is man-made, and because of this it can get pretty icy and sometimes hard to maneuver. Skiing on fresh powder is ten times better.  -Because this is a local resort it is not very big. It takes 5 minutes to get down the mountain and there are only a handful of slopes so you'll ski down all of them fairly quickly. There is not much variety."}
{"text":"Just as charming as I remember growing up, but a lot more snowboarders now.   Two stars off because 1) they turned my favorite slope (downdraft) into a terrain park since their other ones weren't open yet. and 2) they stopped operating the shuttle service between BM and BW, although I'm not sure if it still runs on the weekends.  Three stars come from plenty of lifts for the size, good snowmaking coverage, and 1/2 off passes thanks to having my season pass from mad river.  As good as you can get within an hour of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Our favorite nearby ski/snowboarding place. Plenty of hills, great service! It's a fun place to hang out - especially if you're with a group!"}
{"text":"Nice training slopes and a good near by local resort.  Many people complain that it is not like upstate NY, or Vail, CO, and they are correct.  It is a wonderful local Ski Resort with a nice small ski lodge.  Nice if you want to hit the slopes after work, or a quick weekend run down the slopes."}
{"text":"I've been going here since grade school. They have an excellent program for learning how to ski and snowboard which I did myself when I was young. I just went back recently and found it hasn't changed much. The upstairs bar at Boston Mills is awesome. Very festive with the décor and has great food. Brandy Wines bar is slightly on the douchey side. Loud music and packed all the way out to the balcony. Not really my scene.  I find it best for experienced skiers and snowboarders to go during the day when kids are in school, or late at night. Since I don't get to go as often as I like, I prefer Boston Mills. It's a little on the easier side. Plus I've found that the better athletes go to Brandy Wine and I hate to get in the way. I can still board with the best of them, but the older I get, the more cautious I become."}
{"text":"We checked Brandywine out last night. Great weather for a night out on the hills, decent powder, with a few icy patches. It was \"ladies night\" which is a great special, my husband and I were able to ski under $30! Little did we know everyone else in the area also wanted to ski cheap! Place was slammed busy! which isn't anything against the resort, just made for a long night with little pleasure. Kind of like waiting in line at disneyworld for one 30 second ride. The runs aren't very long and the overall place is a little small. For beginners/intermediate skiers, there are about 3 hills and they are very much\"bunnyhills.\" Overall, for the $30 we spent for the night, it wasn't bad, but I wouldn't go back paying for a day pass. Maybe we will try Boston Mills next time or just stick with Alpine Valley, which shockingly is a little more fun just because of the longer runs."}
{"text":"I agree with the earlier post that this resort is great for people who haven't skied outside Ohio. It is expensive, and I found the staff to just expect me to know all of the logistics of the \"resort\" (i.e. Where the holders are for the lift tickets). The park is small, and doesn't have many food options so I wouldn't call it a resort.  This probably goes without saying, but if you're a beginner only ski/snow board when there's natural snow. I had a particularly bad time on ice-covered hills at this location."}
{"text":"Went tubing at Polar Blast last night and we did have a blast!  At first, we had to wait about 30 minutes in line and another 20 minutes in a line on the hill.  So that wasn't good, but after about an hour, people started to leave.  Once people left, the hill lines moved faster and we got more rides in. I'd love to go back when there is more snow and all the tube hills are open. Tubing was really fun. They had a bonfire and a warm building that you could huddle in and eat/drink. I tasted some french fries and they were decent, but nothing amazing. The tubing area has a large building, which holds lots of people. Most importantly, the building is heated and has lots of tables to sit at while you warm up.  It's a bit pricey to get in, $25 per person, so go when there are deals."}
{"text":"its the only place in cleveland to get your snowboard fix. And its one of the ways you can tolerate winter around here.  Its not colorado with 12k feet elevations but you can get in some decent quick runs in to hone your shredding skills.  Brandywine is my choice to go to since they cater more to snowboarders with a novice and advanced terrain park and other various hills of all skill levels to accomodate everyone.  Its great on Friday night midnight madness.  The bar is packed and there is a DJ there cutting it up with decent tunes."}
