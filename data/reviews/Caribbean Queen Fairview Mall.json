{"text":"We got the $8.89 2 meat combo. My girlfriend and I would share since we were having popcorn after at the movie. The staff is Asian. The food tastes very Asian. We had choice of rice or noodles, and the noodles could not be differentiated from Chinese fast food. I chose mushrooms as one of my vegetable sides and that was really good. I forget my other side. I went for the old standard Jerk chicken which was really good and had a lot of flavour. It was diced and not on the the bone. All the other stuff were things I tried before so I ordered this battered chicken like thing thinking it might be new, but it ended up tasting like something I had before in Chinese food. The portions were very generous and I had a large lunch the next day.  I was saying to my girlfriend there are Asians in Jamaica so it might be fusion, but if it was, there was not enough flavours being mixed and fused to make it special.   Would I eat here again? For the portion size and quality for the price, yes. If I'm in the mood for something done excellently or for never-tried unique dishes (which is almost always when I eat out), then I'd probably look elsewhere."}
{"text":"It was a pleasant dinner experience after a very long day trip. I was very hungry and wanted to have dinner immediately after getting out of the subway station. Recommended for hungry carnivores looking for a simple satisfying meal that is also cost-friendly."}
{"text":"I really liked the Food there until I pulled a long dark hair from my mouth after chewing a bite full of their food. I'm certain I don't have a hair on my body that was as long as that one. It had to have come from someone behind the counter. YUCK!!!"}
{"text":"In a food court full of the usual suspects (Taco Hell, McDogFood, etc) this place stands out for exceptional value and service.   I usually order the combo with 2 meat selections and the sweet girls always stack it high for me. I like that because I can never get enough Jamaican spiced chicken. Not a fan of the noodles or the rice but the veggies and plantation bananas are all right I guess (I'm a carnivore to the core so if it isn't meat it's a distraction anyway).   In summary: Every ting is irie mon!"}
{"text":"Have been to Carribean Queen quite a few times when visiting Fairview Mall, I wouldn't agree with the 'fair value for money' statement from the other reviewers.  Prices have gone up and the portions have in fact decreased, even though the menu is still the same. While we were paying, I asked my girlfriend if this would be enough food for us since we were sharing, the lady overheard and offered to give us a little more rice. Even so, I was pretty disappointed when I got to the table and opened the container up. Very little amount of rice and chicken, bottom of the container soaking in oil after we finished. $9 and change spent, but still hungry.   My advice would be to jump in the car and drive to local places for better food."}
{"text":"Come here every time I go to Fairview Mall to eat. I usually get a combo with spicy rice or noodles, mixed vegetables and Jerk chicken. Their quality of food is good. Jerk Chicken is nice and tender."}
{"text":"Whenever you feel like having a heavy meal I would recommend this place. They give different options of rice and noodles. We tried noodles and curry rice and both were decent. Different combos are available depending on your appetite like one meat 1 veggie or 1 meat 2 veggie etc. We tried sweet potatoes, was little only but crispy and good with mushroom and broccoli. Good value for money and heavy for lunch"}
{"text":"A good choice at the Fairview Mall food court. Great spicy jerk chicken and fantastic Bbq chicken (a mix of chaisiu and BBQ)."}
{"text":"Had a hankering for some Jamaican food and behold ...... Caribbean Queen! Of course it's a bunch of Asian girls working there but that's fine. I got a combo 1 - rice and peas and a chicken leg. The chicken is moist and very flavourful and the rice and peas was actually quite good!  Since I ordered my meal at 830 pm on the last Friday before Christmas, I'm surprised that it's still hot and tastes quite fresh! They gave a heaping amount of the peas n rice which I am very happy with!  I would definitely recommend this spot and would eat here again! As for authenticity, I would say not so much.... but they did use the right flavours and quality was good!"}
