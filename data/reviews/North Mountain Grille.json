{"text":"This charming little restaurant is a hidden treasure! North Mountain Grille has a fantastic fun-filled happy hour with very friendly and attentive staff. Their main course entrees are fantastic--high quality. The appetizers are great, too. Try the Brie & Lavash. My wife and I love crab cakes! Cooked to perfection. The owners are from Maryland and clearly know how to source and prepare the best ingredients! If you remember the hip and delicious Coronado Cafe in downtown Phoenix, it's the same owners. This review would not be complete without mentioning the A+ wines. Solid house red. Go there, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Two of us decided to have dinner here on a Friday around 6:30pm.  We had no idea this place was so popular on Fridays!  We were greeted and seated promptly.  Our waitress was amazing!  Crab cake appetizer was delicious!  Caprese salad was delicious!  We had meatloaf and chicken marsala and both were phenomenal.  Food and service were top notch!  They had live music which was a great touch.  

We went back on a Saturday night a few weeks later around 5:30pm.  There were two other occupied tables.  One server was working which would normally be fine for three tables.  He was very polite and had a pleasant smile.  But we ran out of water several times and dirty dishes weren't promptly removed from the table (appetizer and salad).  My husband's Reuben had no Russian dressing.  When we inquired about that, the server indicated they only have Ranch dressing.  When we told him the menu said Russian, he seemed shocked then went to the kitchen and got some.  He came back and said there was a language barrier with the kitchen.  Then I questioned why my Chicken Pomodoro had angel hair instead of cappellini (as stated on the menu), he said they serve whatever pasta they have at the time then smiled and walked away.  Regardless of what pasta was served, I was underwhelmed by the $18 Pomodoro dish and my husband's Reuben was just okay.  

We had very different experiences, as you can see.  If we return, we will make sure it's on a Friday when they have their A-level staff working."}
{"text":"This place was terrible.  I called ahead to see if they had availability for a large group of 12 and they said yes.  We arrived and only one waitress was working.  We waited over an hour and a half for our food which was terrible. The staff never apologized or brought extra bread or comped us.  The other tables were busing their own tables and everyone was waiting for food. Total disaster."}
{"text":"Had dinner here twice during our recent Phoenix trip. Sam our host was very gracious.  Service and food was wonderful.  Great appetizers and happy hour menu too.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent seafood (really the best crab cakes in Arizona) and other tempting dishes make this a great dinner spot."}
{"text":"Great salmon and curry shrimp pasta! Great local ambiance and pleasant service! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We've lived in the neighborhood 25 years and seen restaurants come and go . . . two or three in this location.  This is the best ever!  We ate with friends and everyone was very happy with their meals - the scallops were deemed the \"best I ever had.\" The salmon and chicken were soooo good and the salads were super.  It is a great place to go if you want to hold actual conversations - not only is it suitably quiet, but the waiter(s) had excellent timing - they were attentive without being intrusive, which seems to be less common lately. We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience!  Maria at the bar was attentive and provided great service!"}
{"text":"Bringing the old Coronado Cafe back to where it belongs, right here in Phoenix!! Good old Standbys the crab cakes and meatloaf are back too!"}
{"text":"A delightful addition to the neighborhood. Wonderful to finally have a good sea food rearrange for date night or as in our case, brunch after church. Warm and welcoming service in a comfortable, light yet cozy atmosphere.  The menu has something for everyone with an emphasis on quality crab and fish without unreasonable pricing. Indoor or outdoor seating, pleasant music and friendly vibe. Try it. I think you will be as pleased as we were."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and left unimpressed. The food was under seasoned, and over priced."}
{"text":"It was getting late and we were headed to a fast food chain when we decided to switch gears and try the new-ish grille up the road. This place was great, it happened to be open mic night so we sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by a friendly bartender. The owners were mingling with their customers and the restaurant was a buzz, I love when you walk in somewhere and it feels like an old friend's cocktail party. I think everyone knew everyone. It is truly a welcoming atmosphere and the food didn't disappoint at all. My husband and I both got burgers, well done and they were cooked to perfection. The Cajun seasoning on the French fries wasn't so bad either ;). I ordered the Malbec and my husband had a Coors Light, with our drinks and meals our bill was well under $40.00. I can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu! Maybe we will pop in for brunch next time... $4.00 mimosas and bloody Mary's... Hakuna Mimosa, it means it's brunch time, Ya'll. Sign. Me. Up."}
{"text":"After many visits to the prior restaurants at this location, the was our first under the current ownership.  The new owners did a nice job of freshening the place up, including taking down the wall behind the bar that the last owner put up and opening up the patio.  There is more of an open and friendly feel now.  We went there at about 7 on a Friday night.  Even though the restaurant was half empty, it took 15 minutes to take our drink order.  Our food was very slow in coming, but good upon arrival.  Consideration should be given to some fresh bread, especially if service is expected to be slow.  We will be back because we want the new owners to prosper, but hope that some of the kinks can be worked out since out-of-town patrons are not as likely to be patient as those in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We have become regulars at this moon valley gem! Best happy hour going!!! All you north central foodies should come a little further north and give this a try!!! Owners are hands on and delightful. New menu additions include one of the best hamburgers I've had and I am a hamburger lover."}
{"text":"This was our first time here as North Mountain Grille, my husband enjoyed the meatloaf, and I ordered the scallops. I had hoped the sauce would be light but it was quite heavy and oily. The wait staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"Went for the first time tonight, I had the crab cakes and my husband had the meatloaf. Large portions, crab cakes had a ton of crab which was great! However lacked flavor. Some old bay seasoning or something would have been good. I put hot sauce on them which helped, hubby liked the meatloaf but found the balsamic too sweet for the savory meatloaf. Service was great, the bartender was very nice. Will return!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal provided by this chef.... crab cake was AWESOME!! Onion Rings were delightful and light!! Good food, reasonable prices. I'll be bringing my family here!! Can hardly wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  My waiter, Sam, was attentive and helpful.  The ambiance is wonderful.  I sat on the patio, had the combo sampler & glass of wine.  For a busy area, it was quiet & relaxing."}
{"text":"If you loved Coranado Cafe when it had it's original owner than you MUST try North Mountain Grille! It is the original owner of the Coronado Cafe and her new fabulous venture!! So if you're looking for q homey atmosphere and menu, look no further!!"}
{"text":"Oh Sam.  We DO like it, Sam I am.  We loved our waiter Sam.  And the new menu and the new atmosphere.  Down with that ridiculous half wall and the negligent staff and old owner.  We ordered two of the supposedly best things on the menu, the Maryland Crab Cakes and the Pan Seared Scallops over risotto.  OMG.  The scallops were perfectly cooked and melted  in your mouth. And the crab cakes lives up to their notoriety.  Our only negative was we waited a tad too long for our cocktails and would have liked some bread on the table, though I'm sure my doctor would disagree.  I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu.  And visit with Sam.  His voice is velvet and he's not bad on the eyes, either."}
{"text":"Have not been to the restaurant yet; however, my wife and I ordered delivery of the meatloaf, salmon and a strawberry salad. The meatloaf and salad were excellent. Looking forward to dining in restaurant some evening."}
{"text":"Went there with my honey for happy hour on Saturday. we were surprised that it was pretty busy at 4:30. The house wine for happy hour was good for 4 dollars a glass. We ordered 2 apps and enjoyed them both. The crab cakes were delicious,  full of crab and not to much filling. The lavoush was crunchy and tasty. It could of had a little more brie cheese. We will definitely come back again. Our only complaint is that the menu is a little pricey for what you get. Cute,relaxed decore.. A great neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Such UNBELIEVABLY SLOW service! I got here over an hour ago (possible more) and still have nothing to comment on but the water-- FYI it's tap!

They have TWO servers scheduled on a Friday night, who are polite when they appear from their lair! It took us about 15 minutes to get sat one of the 8 open tables, another 15 minutes to get water, and probably 15 more before our order was ever placed... I have a feeling it will be next year before we get our meals (1 STAR SO FAR)

.... (if more develops I will comment)

Not changing that review!
My mom's steak was COLD and the cheese on the potato looked like GLUE! My boyfriend's burger came with cheese-- when he ordered it without and the server double checked... only meal that came out halfway decent was the Diver Scallops... it was actually pretty good. Just makes me mad that we had to send one back and should've sent the second. 

As my gift to you for the holidays... I give you knowledge about the crappy food and service. 

Oh and the server NEVER did his check back so only reason we were able to send one back was because the cheese was spotted on the burger"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 4 times in the past 2 weeks. It is a very nice addition to this area. First of all Sam is a great waiter. The staff and owners are very accommodating. They will adjust any dish to how you prefer it. The first time, I had a beef filet with a pesto sauce on it. It was different than anything I had before and the sauce made it very interesting. The portion was much larger than usual, and the steak was tender as a filet should be. My husband and I have gone 2 times for the happy hour menu, which is available until 7pm. This is great because so many times we don't want to go out to eat too early for most happy hour menus. The flat bread is very good, and somehow, they manage to keep it crispy and not soggy like so many flatbreads become after adding toppings. They have a few salad options that come in 2 sizes and you can add chicken, and I don't remember other options, but I think shrimp and steak maybe. Diane, who is the owner, makes you feel very welcome. She was the past owner of the Coronado Cafe, and has bought some of the specialties from that establishment to this restaurant. Oh, and they have the best garlic bread, and I don't usually like garlic bread!! This is a restaurant that you definitely should try, and I hope they become a permanent fixture in our neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"With 20 friends having our holiday brunch, awesome brunch food!! Everything from burgers, yummy crab Benedict and crab sandwich, great omelette and $3 mirmosas, bloody Mary's and champagne"}
{"text":"We were traveling and ended up here for dinner twice in 2 days!!  It was so great we had to return immediately.  Friendly, attentive service, great prices and everything we had was excellent - the cannolini, kids spaghetti, hummus and all the desserts.  Delicious.  Will return again for sure."}
{"text":"I tried the hangover burger when I went in. It was a little pricy at $13 but the amount of food they put on it makes it entirely worth it. This thing is a MONSTER! It has fries, an egg, onion rings all on top of a huge beef patty. This thing was hard to finish despite my huge appetite. The hollandaise sauce was a great finishing touch on the great burger."}
{"text":"Super disappointed after reading some good reviews before . Had been hoping for a great meal to go ! But unfortunately it was not . 

We had bought the appetizer shrimp cocktail and crab cakes . The cocktail wasn't anything special . And the crab cakes were very disappointing , no flavor at all . Quite a bit of shelling left behind . Had to put the cocktail sauce to give it some flavor to make it worth eating . 

For dinner we had got the stuffed peppers . It had a good flavor , unfortunately some veggies were overcooked and some undercooked . 

Maybe it would have been better if we dined in , but for being $40 we won't be attempting that any time soon"}
{"text":"Unfortunately,  I cannot agree with the  4 and 5 star reviews. It was probably one of the worst meals I have had in years. The Crab Imperial was inedible,  as it was terribly fishy. I then ordered the Chicken Marsala with pasta.  The chicken was very hard and the pasta was very mushy. I think they need to define just  what type of restaurant they are. Their menu is all over the place. If they can't do a good job with seafood or an Italian dish, what can they do. The only redeeming feature, was the lovely young lady who took care of us."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place.  The owner is a friend and I love Moon Valley Cafe his other place a block away.  Went in on a Friday night, seated almost immediately.  Nice ambience and polite wait staff.  Waiter recommended wine... went with the red (nice pick).  Crab cake appetizers were good.  Apple walnut salad was good as well.  From here it went downhill.  I ordered the surf and turf, medium rare.  The meat came out undercooked... barely warm (medium rare can still be hot in temperature).  The meat had a garlic/cheese/butter topping that tasted great but wouldn't even melt due to meat being cold.  Shrimp were small but sauce they were in was spicy and flavored well.  For a $28 entree I was very disappointed  (more like a $16 special at Outback).  My wife ordered the Imperial Crab... which on the menu gave the impression it was lump crab with a sauce.  These are really just the same crab cakes served in fancy glass bowls.  The loaded baked potato was the SMALLEST potato I have seen served at a restaurant.  You have to be looking for small potatoes when you are shopping to get something that small.  And loaded just means cheese and sourcream.  No scallions.  No bacon.  Again, misleading.  I probably won't be back although I'll still frequent Moon Valley Cafe."}
{"text":"Went here last Friday night and the service was aweful. No attention to our table by our waiter. It seemed like because we didn't order alcohol he could not be bothered to provide us with better service. We ordered and the food was so so. Lacked flavor. The curry shrimp lacked curry and the shrimp was over cooked and rubbery. The scallops were tiny and seasoned / cooked poorly.  The chicken parm was pre breaded frozen product that was cooked then pan fried in wine and covered in sauce. No salad or soup or bread with your entree and they are not cheap. $16- $26 a plate. Ordered a Coke it was flat. Sent it back 3 times. Ordered lemonade it was over powering then got a new glass that was weak. Never going back and you should avoid this place. Not worth the value"}
{"text":"Good food to be had here even if the whole experience is out of the 1970s. The crab cakes are easily the best we've had for some time. The stuffed mushrooms were exceptional and our spinach salad quite good. The service is friendly and the ambiance pleasantly casual. There is a bit of odor and some of the people were a bit loud. All in all, we will be returning."}
{"text":"We went for brunch on Sunday today but found it closed for brunch until Fall.  It was good during Winter......"}
{"text":"Our family went to the Grill for Mother's Day.  Mothers received a complimentary glass of champagne and a red carnation.
We've been anxious to try its crab cakes for awhile and yet reluctant because we haven't found any noteworthy crab cakes in Phoenix yet. 
We ordered the crab cakes appetizer first just to get a taste of what we could expect if ordering the crab cakes dinner. Outstanding! With large pieces of fresh crab, just enough mayonnaise to bind the crab together and minimal bread crumbs. The crabcakes were crispy on the outside and so tasty, so I ordered them for brunch. You will not be disappointed. I did not even miss having no bread or salad. 
We also ordered the meatloaf that was excellent; salmon piccata, excellent; the halibut with a citrus marinade. Everyone was truly delighted with their menu choices. Our server Jackie gave us exceptional service. 
Too full to eat dessert, we ordered the homemade key lime pie and the bourbon cheesecake to go. The key lime pie was one of the best and most flavorful lime pies I've ever had. No word yet on the cheesecake.
The prices are reasonable and it is worth experiencing this restaurant and choosing as many food items as possible. We'll definitely be back?

{"text":"A bit of a hidden gem, there doesn't seem to be many restaurants around this area, but then there doesn't have to be. This place is great. As a chef myself I have some high standards for the food that I eat, and I definitely approve. Take some time with some friends to check this place out. Try the meatloaf!!!!"}
