{"text":"After frequenting driving by this place i decided to check it out with a friend. I ordered a 805 draft beer since its my favorite beer, have it in my fridge at home and it's my normal beer of choice when I see it on any menu. After the bartender gave it to me my friend as well as myself immediately just by looking at it said this isn't 805 beer it was way too light in color. I took a sip and it tasted like a normal domestic like a Miller or Coors. I said to the bartender this isn't a 805. Rather than seeing if the keg was hooked up to the wrong tap she said yes it is, I said no way is this a 805 beer. Never have I had this happen to me. I miss the last place that used to be there called Owl. Nothing special about this place, not going there again especially after this experience. Be careful what you order it could be a different type of beer than what you requested."}
{"text":"Screw this place.  I went here late night and rang the doorbell 50 times, I stood out there for 15 minutes and was never let in while there was people at the bar nobody would come to the door they Would look back towards the door when I would hit the button but nobody would get off their lazy worthless ass and open the door fuck this place lazy worthless bartenders probably smoking crack. They were probably having a meeting like the Sons of Anarchy this place is probably a cover-up for something else some illegal activities crack sales."}
{"text":"4 in the morning. Breakfast was awesome. Didn't expect the giant plate of food I received."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and have a few frosty ones.... Will try the HOT wings next time... Just curious what the connection of this Tavern has to do with tailgatertavern.com  See you soon."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The people are super friendly and Autumn (bartender) is awesome. Chill place, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Nice sports bar with the small town feel to it, the bartender was really friendly. Enjoyed a night here."}
{"text":"Favorite place to grab a drink, great seating area and food. could use a dart board or some kind of game for a more tailgater feeling though. Come here and enjoy a cold one and their daily specials are awesome!    Update!!! 06/29/2018  They got a pool table! Shuffle board! And golden tee!!! Woot!!! Do not put your drinks on brand new pool table I will personally hunt you down."}
{"text":"Dive bar. Bottom line. Im a late night attendee, because i work graveyard. Food is quick. Shots are quicker. Great place. Used to be old hammer, hammer and ales, and then The Owl. If youve been here before you know the feel is. Paul wall works the grave and also runs the joint! Right across from crazy horse 3 and down the street from the new stadium. U know itll be great. Just come check if out now before it becomes \"cool\""}
{"text":"This is a very unique bar in Vegas.  Located in a business district but very accessible and ample parking.    We came here to do our fantasy MLB draft and we were very happy with what they have to offer.    Big bar with plenty of food and beer options, good prices and great service.    They also have the main bar, then a private room and run another ultra private room upstairs.  Very cool.  I enjoyed the wings, fries and a great Philly sandwich."}
