{"text":"Best pizza in Elyria hands down great customer service very clean the sauce is loco toppings after toppings"}
{"text":"Came in to the store while in a hurry and loved the place! Owner and workers were more than kind and the place has a great warm feel to it. Pizza is really AMAZING and the cheesy garlic bread is out of this world! Definitely try it out if you're in the area. Great combo meals available too!"}
{"text":"Just had my first taste of loco pizza and I am amazed. The sauce has got a zing to it that I have never tasted any where.  Honestly one of the top 5 pizzas I have ever had."}
{"text":"Writing a surprising review for me. This is a brand new pizza place on Cleveland Street in Elyria. We got coupons in the Wednesday mailbox fliers and knew we were babysitting tonight so we got the Hawaiian Pizza and a Pepperoni Pizza. We did pick up instead of delivery. The pizza was delicious. The Hawaiian was one of the best we've had and the pepperoni was good as well. They only offer pick up or delivery as the place is pretty small. They have subs, salads, wings and breads too. Looking forward to trying them again soon!!!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza! We just had it at Altitude for my son's birthday party. Hot, fresh, and tangy! I will be ordering from these guys soon! I'm looking forward to trying other foods at Loco!
Update-
Ordered a pepperoni pizza and garlic knots for dinner and it was fantastic! I have been getting tired of the other pizza places in my area and am very excited to have a new option. Can't wait to order from Loco pizza Pie again! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Order completed promptly, however, undercooked, and one pie was missing the pepperoni.  Tasted great, but hard to eat when the center is soggy."}
{"text":"I must say, this is probably the best pizza place I've gone too in a long time! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best pizza I've ever had. Don't know what kind of sauce they use but it's definitely different & different is good  great job. Very kind people as well."}
{"text":"We gave Loco Pie Pizza a try tonight, and it did not disappoint! I really liked their sauce, there's something different about it that I can't put my finger on, but it was really good. Generous on the toppings as well, and the crust was tasty. And the garlic knots-AMAZING! They were so good. Thanks for a great meal! :)"}
