{"text":"Xavier made us the most delicious breakfast for lunch! We ordered the Hound Dog. It was cooked perfectly, and tasted just like home. We are regulars for sure now. Anytime you want a great home cooked meal for a really decent price, I would definitely suggest going to Huntridge. Especially when Chef Xavier is working. My grandmother would definitely approve of his breakfast making skills."}
{"text":"It's actually called the Huntridge Diner. I went here for lunch last week and yeah I guess it was A-ok. I had the daily special, which for Tuesday is a Burger, Fries and Soda for $6.95. The burger didn't taste like much but it wasn't bad. The fries probably came from Sysco but they were battered and pretty tasty. Everyone was very friendly including the girl at the front cashier counter and even the cook. Besides me there was only one other customer in there so the service was good."}
{"text":"Food is great for the price and they owner and employees are friendly. Best kosher ( no hersher tho) breakfast/brunch option in Las Vegas. You can eat anything that's on the menu all day long."}
{"text":"A little hard to find and in a somewhat sketchy neighborhood, but they have great kosher diner food and a very nice staff.  The main (new) chef, William, was our favorite part.  He had a great sense of humor and was incredibly nice and professional, and man, can he cook up a storm!  Classic kosher comfort food.  I wish we could convince William to come back to Pico/Robertson in LA and open up a place.  Great, cool, place."}
{"text":"I loved Huntridge Pharmacy. Specially their milkshakes, they are really good. I also like their tuna sandwich, I forgot it's name, you should try it. Hamburger is also a excellent choice. I like to go with my children every Sunday."}
{"text":"We are three locals having lunch here on a Wednesday - 1)  place recked of cigarette smoke - 2) staff does not seem to have an urgency in getting folks served - 3) food was okay -"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing!  Great food, great service and great people! One couldn't possibly ask for more. This place is most definitely the place to be! I strongly recommend people to check it out!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Really friendly staff and clean place with a retro feel to it. It also has a vegetarian friendly menu. Make sure to say hi to Xavier!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I never knew this place existed. I frequent Hi-Rollers Barbershop quite often and always notice this pharmacy.     Well, I finally went in this morning for brunch and I was actually amazed at the '50's vibe in this place. It was pretty awesome! The music definitely went great with the vibe, too.  I went with the John Wayne burger and it was amazing. I think this is the same as the cowboy burger. Either way, I did enjoy it because it was not soaking in BBQ sauce like most places happen to over do it.  My girlfriend went with the Bye Bye Love Bananas Foster French Toast and she said it was \"SO DAMN GOOD\". Of course I did not just take her word for it; I went in for the dive and It was a warm gooey deliciousness!  This place smelled like smoke/very old. But give this place a try regardless!  We were the only ones there during that time, and the guy behind the counter was doing it all: Orders, cooking, phone etc. Seems like a hard worker (he needs a raise)!  Keep up the good work! We will be returning for more food!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, the interior throwback is enough to warrant three stars. The fourth is for outstanding food. One would never suspect that a time machine lays dormant inside this little pharmacy. This is the kind of place I only dream about. It wasn't crowded at 10am - the food was made right there on the grill in front of us and the waitress was pleasant. As it should be, cash only. And when you are done - bop next door (literally attached) to the Huntridge Bar. It's equally nostalgic!"}
{"text":"Extremely nice staff, and the food is pretty good. They were out of my first choice, which was enchiladas, and out of all the pasta. We ordered a quesadilla, French fries, and white pizza. The pizza was good, but they were out of spinach. It could have used some garlic and a little less white sauce.  It's in a not so great part of town, but it's very nostalgic. I would love to see them change the space and bring in some bands and dancing. So much potential there."}
{"text":"The food was great and I liked the feel of the Huntridge Pharmacy, but the service was very slow. I'm thinking it was just a one-time type deal, but the place wasn't even busy. Aside from that, the employees were nice and my food, the mac and cheese bites/vanilla milkshake w/ malt, were tasty and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great service. Great ice cream-Old fashioned hand packed pints. Diner style kosher menu. Great for vegetarians.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"What an awesome surprise! This hidden soda fountain packs a serious vegetarian punch.   Although the decor leaves a bit to be desired, the friendly staff, delicious food, and reasonable prices definitely balance things out and makes this spot a must for vegetarian and carnivore alike!   There is no question that I'll be back to work my way through their entire menu :)   (Take the staffs recommendations! They know their menu!)"}
{"text":"My wife and I keep strict kosher and we live in Los Angeles. LA has great kosher places to eat, but they're around 20%-50% higher than their non-kosher counterparts (regardless of quality). Huntridge Restaurant not only has amazingly delicious food, but it's prices are about the same as a non-kosher place, which is incredible in and of itself!  We stayed in Vegas, for our summer vacation, four days and ate here three of them. The food was delicious, portions were very generous, everything was made to order, and the service was very fast and friendly.   Of all the shows, museums, and other attractions to do in Las Vegas, Huntridge was definitely among our most favorite. We can't wait to visit Las Vegas again just to eat here!"}
{"text":"Retro! Fun! Kosher! Affordable good food! This is so much fun! Perfect dairy food for the nine days."}
{"text":"A great dive bar has to strike a delicate balance between grungy and comfortable.  It should feel like the cozy little hole in the wall where the floor isn't that clean and the booths are slightly broken, but the beer and liquor are well stocked and the characters are colorful.  Think dirty enough that T.G.I. Friday's managers would be disgusted, but safe enough that you're not getting a knife in your side when you sidle up to the bar.  And in Las Vegas, Huntridge Tavern is that bar.  I head here a lot during happy hour and find a collection of folks who are happy to be drinking--the clientele is usually a mix of folks just off work, folks down on their luck and smart ass regulars lined up along the bar talking to the bartender.  There's a lot of attitude is this bar.  Go with it and you'll have a good time.  And Huntridge follows through on the crucial requirement for a dive bar: cheap drinks.  Beer is $2-3 from the tap, liquor was pretty damn cheap (for a generous pour as well).  It's definitely my favorite hole in the wall in town."}
{"text":"When my friend who keeps Kosher visited, we went to this Dairy restaurant for lunch twice; 'Dairy' means absolutely NO meat in Kosher terms, it is all faux meat. People bag on the location and decor, but I especially enjoy the nostalgic interior.   First visit I had the Huntridge Burger (with cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms, hold the steak sauce) he had the John Wayne Burger (cheese, barbecue sauce and onion rings) our sides of fries were requested and served extra crispy. We both had malteds: strawberry for me, chocolate for him, both ordered extra thick as some reviews said they were thin, they were delicious!   Enjoying our meals enough to return, I had the Greek Salad, which was very good and quite a large portion; he had the John Wayne Burger and chocolate malted again. He lives in New York, where Kosher restaurants are plentiful, and enjoyed the Huntridge quite a bit, particularly at their reasonable price point.   Definitely a fan, I'll return again for inexpensive and tasty veggie burgers, salads, and malteds.   * all vegetarian/Kosher Dairy *   ** closed all day Saturday and Friday at 3PM for Shabbos **  *** \"old fashioned\" ice cream parlor  ***  **** inexpensive, especially for a Kosher restaurant ****"}
{"text":"Searching for an old fashioned soda fountain in Las Vegas, I stopped here this week and it wasn't really what I was expecting!   I had noticed the reviews mentioned vegetarian and kosher food but I didn't really realize the menu would be ALL kosher and vegetarian! I ended up just getting a float but the service was nice and the atmosphere felt authentic.   The area around the shop is a little shady but it's a fine place to go if you want to sit at a soda fountain for a drink."}
{"text":"Great service , great food, great atmosphere , surfer girl sandwich is amazing ! Shakes are real old school shakes, must try."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here to eat and we had the cheese pizza with veggie meat and the alfredo pasta and it was beyond delicious. Xavier was our cook and waiter and he was beyond great. He kept making sure we were satisfied and just provided great service all in all. I'm definitely going to be coming back here! We even got free dessert!"}
{"text":"Great place to see and eat  old vintage records up on the walls everywhere John Wayne Burger is bomb too"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian cuisine at very reasonable prices. They make great pizzas and veggie burgers.  Their breakfast menu is very tasty. The service was great.  The cook greets all customers and tries to make you feel at home. They are also certified kosher."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! First off ANYWHERE that serves THRIFTY ICE CREAM deserves high marks (gawd I miss home) and they dont attempt to rob you for the tasty treat that is Thrifty Sweetened Deliciousness. They have a pretty decent soda bar menu with classics like the egg cream chocolate soda (no actual egg) or the chocolate cherry coke (you sensing a pattern here?) but by far my fav thing to get here is the Cowboy Burger. Meat is grilled to order and the cook is happy to personalize it any way you want things. I love mine with grilled mushrooms and onions, the onion rings just dont satisfy the onion lover within. Bread is basic but its a classic good formula of good portions and out of this world add ons like a real strawberry malt that make this place all comfort and no guilt. Well no guilt for me, Im pretty comfy in the corner of awesome and bombdiggity. Prices are reasonable and the place is kept super clean. They're serious about running a Kosher kitchen but honestly that just means to me that they pay super close attention to food quality. Everythings always fresh and again you cant frown at a place that has specials for families in the area like $1 ice cream Wednesdays. I used to live around here and its nice when a burger joint caters to their neighbors. Cook really busts his butt to make things right for you. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"Every since they hired new staff at this pharmacy it has become a nightmare. I been going to this pharmacy for 8 years. I stopped by yesterday to pick up my meds and was told i didnt have insurance. The next morning i called my insurance company who told me i was fully covered. Turns out they incorrectly ran my insurance. I will be changing pharmacy."}
{"text":"This place ghetto. So of course I kinda like it. Doesn't have much inside. But it does have band t-shirts and posters for cheap. It's aiight"}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(108/365) \"Blast From The Past\"  We stopped in for a bite after getting cut next door at Hi-Rollers. HPSF is Drugstore/Pharmacy/Diner run by a couple of gentleman, and as you step inside, it is as if you went back in time to the 50's and 60's. It is very spacious with dining booths as well as counter dining if you wish to do so.   Perusing the menu, it seems like a lot of choices on paper, but they seemed to be out of a few selections as we were inquiring on certain menu items and descriptions. Wifey and I narrowed it down and we split a Cowboy Burger with a couple of shakes. She got a Strawberry Shake and I went with the Watusi Whopper. FYI, all burgers, sandwiches, and items that are usually made with meat are not. Every item is vegetarian, and they use veggie meat from Morning Star.  The burger and fries were pretty good even though nothing is made in-house, and the shakes were not as thick as I prefer, but decent. Service was good, and price point is reasonable. Stop in if you're in the area and give these guys a try! ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \u  3.25"}
{"text":"The outside sign was misleading at first because it said \"Pharmacy\" but it is also a diner, a VEGETARIAN diner to be exact.   When I walked in, I was not expecting the food to be as amazing as it was! Especially since I'm a meat-lover but damn these guys can cook!  We ordered pizza fries, pancakes for the lil kid, the Huntridge burger, onion rings, and Mac and Cheese. My order was the Mac and cheese and I am in love. I think they ran out of macaroni pasta and substituted it for penne but I didn't care, it looked more fancier with penne lol. They topped the Mac and cheese with some crispy bread crumbs and paprika which was a nice touch. & actually when I got home I found that the Mac and cheese tasted even better than before (is that even possible!?).  Hubby ordered the pizza fries and that was bomb af too. Fries were a bit soggy but it was appropriate for the pizzaness. The onion rings were fresh and crunchy & we also ordered a chocolate milkshake. That milkshake was bomb af too and I'm not the biggest fan of sweet things. They use Thriftys ice cream which is probably why the milkshake was so good too :)   Overall I loved the blast-from-the-past vibe. The staff was so friendly. The server Louis was super nice and checked up on us constantly. And even Chef X checked up on us a few times and I think he did a fantastic job on the food. It's a great hole in the wall place to eat and I will definitely be back in the near future to try their other food."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a 50s diner, so I have always wanted to check this place out! I'm so glad I finally did because PIZZA FRIES exists!! So yummy! My daughter got a cheesecake milkshake and it was delicious! I will definitely be back really soon!"}
{"text":"Great place to bring family and friends. Truly one of a kind! An old gem in the heart of Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is different than most restaurants. This place is a drug store, yet they have this diner right smack dab in the middle of their store. Triply...... Also because this place is \"KOSHER\" They do not serve bacon or sausage here. So I ordered the \" Elvis cakes\",which consist of peanut butter & chocolate chip, with whipped cream on top, with bananas in it also. Friendly service, although we are the only 2 customers here. Lol..... I'll remember this place to say the least."}
{"text":"If you're sensitive to cigarette smoke then you should stay away. This place is a relic the ventilation is non-existent so it reeks of smoke. With that being said it's a nostalgic treat and the two person working the counter took great care of us. The portions were absolutely massive, but I wasn't terribly impressed with the quality of the food we ordered. Everything was frozen fare and I've had way better vegetarian options in the Valley...still I'm glad we got to try the Huntridge out. All in all, I don't think we'll be back because of the overwhelming cigarette smell. It was very very strong and not something I want my kids around."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. First time customer...but I will be back TOMORROW!!!  The chef Xavier is inventive. His culinary creations are works of art. So impressive!!!"}
{"text":"I was referred to this pharmacy by my dr. Office. Upon entering, either the air was off or they just don't have any. I walked over to the eatery to get a ice cream for my Grandson while I waited for my prescription. The cook behind the counter was very rude.  My Grandson was playing with a toy, and he automatically snapped. Now instead of greeting me, and asking me what I needed in this ran down little dive,  his main concern was the toy my Granites playing with. As if I didn't have the  money to buy him anything. I will never come here again. And I will let everyone at the dr. Office know that this was not a pleasant experience ."}
{"text":"This place is a BLAST from the Past(#IOWAtasmic) a drug store with a lunch counter! Plus a pharmacy & an attached Bar.  Theres no wait just sit right up to th e counter and order. They have a small simple menu but good prices.  We ordered a 2 egg breakfast and a Philly Cheese Steak.  The service was very fast & friendly But then again we were the ONLY customers.  The food was good fresh & tasty maybe a little greasy but I like greasy. Check the pics to see it.  I would definitely try it again maybe the burger which is said to be their big winner here."}
{"text":"I have dined here before when it was like a more run down version of Tiffany's. But somehow I missed a refurbishing and was surprised to see News channel 8 do a story on it. It looks like a 50's malt shop now, and has expanded about 15 people's worth if you've been in there before.   You can see how it used to look like by looking at the floor. It's black and white tiled, but under the counter where they employees stand is the drab floor it used to be. And look at the ceiling tiles, you can see the cutoff from the restaurant to the pharmacy, the old faded yellow color used to be above the diner as well. Looks like it was stained from age and cigarettes. (Incidentally, it looks like original painting work on the back wall of the pharmacy.)  There were 2 guys working the restaurant: a cook/ cashier and a server/ busser/ cashier. After the news piece, I believe they weren't prepared for the rush we experienced when we were there. there were a lot of older people there, we were probably the youngest. But no one minded, this was an environment where people weren't jerks about planning their 20 minute break in a full service restaurant. People didn't mind waiting just out of wanting the \"reopening\" of the place to do well, economy and employment considered.  Some tables weren't bussed, in fact I wanted to help the guy and clean some up so more people could sit. Wonder if they'll add on a new person...  The best part was the food! They changed the menu, they used to have some Chinese food and the fried rice was my favorite. I hope they eventually bring that back. But they have burgers, Philly's, hot dogs, soda fountain, breakfasts. They don't appear to be open for dinner anymore, which was when I went the most. But I have spent some mornings regretting what I had done the night before my hangover over their breakfasts.  I had the Pizza Philly, which was EXCELLENT, light, crispy bread. We shared a fries and a choc shake, mmade with real ice cream. If they had a host/ cashier, they could be allocated to blending the desserts, too. (I worked at a Marie Callendar's long ago where that worked out fine.)  Oh, I got their take out menu *skimming*  They are open 8:00AM to 3:00PM, and even feature free wi-fi, which is interesting. The lady up front at the register for the Pharmacy couldn't even accept credit cards because they didn't have a phone line to connect their card reader machine to.  I noticed a lot of tug of wars between technology and vintage in this place. I hope they maintain the best of both. There are a lot fo companies that try to build a 50's place, but there are places here that HAVE stood the test of time and are still here, these Mom and Pop places I love going to."}
{"text":"Experience:  I have wanted to try this place with my Grandfather, because it's close and I thought my 95y/o grandfather would like it. So, I came for lunch.   Facility: so freakin cute! You feel like you're stepping back into time. It has old booths and soda fountain counter seats. There is a working pharmacy that I saw a few people getting their prescriptions filled. Plus they have lots of old records to look at.   Service:  After I got over the shock of my waitress telling me they don't have any meat...I then realized the staff here was pretty awesome. Super friendly folks who take pride in what they serve.   Food:  ok...still blown away when the waitress tried to talk me into a veggie burger and I replied I prefer the regular burger, and she slapped me in the face with the news that they don't have any meat here. What?!?! LOL!  Ok, I'll take salsa and chips, are they homemade? Chips are, salsa is not. Ok, I'll take cheese sticks then. We are out!  O.o Ok, give me a cheese pizza then!!   I ended up ordering a white cheese pizza with spinach, tomatoes and mushrooms. It was pretty tasty, but not something I would race back for, especially because I can't get bacon on it. ;P My Grandpa ordered a cheese omelette and it looked very good.   Overall:  I would have given 3 stars for the food, but the staff and nostalgic atmosphere, bumped it to a 4!  This is a neat little shop that I would come back to for the ambience and great staff, and I think I'll get a milkshake next time and sit at the counter. Maybe I'll even put on bobby socks. ;)"}
{"text":"Chef x was so nice to me and my little we had a burger and fry to share and two scoops of icecream and not only are we full but we are also very satisfied. For a vegetarian restaurant u don't taste the difference and makes the healthier choice a lot easier"}
{"text":"I liked this place. It's incredibly odd. It's a pharmacy, 50's diner, record store and general store all in one.   Get the breakfast!!! And their shakes are so good."}
{"text":"I love the Huntridge.  It's a great little neighborhood dive, stress on the dive.  The drinks are crazy cheap, and they always have weekly specials.  The bartenders are friendly and entertaining, and the working-class clientele is refreshingly unpretentious and relaxed.    Warning: it is smoky as all get out in there, and smells like smoke even when it's empty! So if you're sensitive to that, don't go here.    They have a great jukebox, random bar snacks, and an array of bar video games to entertain the drunkards.  I always seem to gravitate toward this place around 2-4 am because it's right on my way home from pretty much anywhere else.    The Huntridge is open 24-hours, but if you feel the need to take the party elsewhere, you can always buy 6-packs or bottles of liquor to go!"}
{"text":"After reading great reviews I was super excited to go here. However it is completely CLOSED. Just a heads up to anyone else looking for kosher food in vegas."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to check this place out on Saturday afternoon, and all of the doors were locked. We were really excited to check it out! I'm not sure if it's even open for business. If it is, they need some store hours posted outside."}
{"text":"Just so you know this no longer is a pharmacy and diner ... my husband and I drove all the way down there to eat because it's been a while and they completely tore it down and have just the pharmacy open... it sucked because this was such a cool diner!! :,("}
{"text":"It is absolutely called the Huntridge Restaurant, not diner. I can only vouch for the burgers at this point, but they are truly outstanding, well seasoned, fresh beef, in the top 20% you will find anywhere. The fries and onion rings are good, but the burgers shine! Hand made shakes are available, but I have not tried one yet. The place is clean, plenty of old original features making for an authentic \"diner\" experience. Just a mile east of  Las Vegas Blvd, corner of Charleston and Maryland Pkwy., makes this an easy find for tourists who enjoy a little local downtown Las Vegas flavor. I hear the Philly cheese steaks are excellent too. Very limited hours, which have changed over the past several months, currently open till 4 p.m. Closed Sunday. One can search \"huntridge restaurant\" on youtube to get a feel of the place. It's a total 50's throwback tucked inside a pharmacy. Staff has always been friendly and attentive. Gotta love the free wi-fi too. A door through the pharmacy leads to a full bar."}
{"text":"Items Selected: The Elvis - Peanut Butter and Bananas, Grilled, with Onion Rings Bye Bye Love Bananas Foster Pancakes - Sauteed Bananas, Walnuts, Caramel, Whipped Cream, Thrifty Vanilla Ice Cream  Closed on Saturdays in observation of Shabbat, and the sort of place I imagine to have changed little since opening in 1962, it was on a rare Sunday dining expedition that I finally visited Huntridge Soda Fountain - the sizable restaurant tucked inside Huntridge Pharmacy where several families already sat enjoying any numbers of shakes, sandwiches, and diner favorites offered at prices harkening an era long past.  Every bit a reminder of a Woolworth's back home in Ohio, with short-order cooks overseeing a menu of classics frequently tinged in whimsy, it was to a service team of one that I was greeted on entry and with a floor polisher whirring in the background as its driver weaved amidst aisles of toiletries, tablets, and even some toys a two-part order was crafted - the total bill less than $14 even after tax and tip for food that was served not only piping hot with a smile, but also surprisingly delicious despite its simplicity.  Admittedly a bit strained in service as my empty beverage languished it was with the $3.95 Elvis Sandwich that my meal began and although buttery Texas Toast surrounding ripe bananas plus ample peanut butter was as tasty as expected the basket of onion rings proved far less foolproof, the flavor of questionably fresh oil rendering the batter entirely off-putting - a $1.50 upcharge eliminated from my bill when I mentioned the issue to its cook.  Moving on to something far more decadent it was after only half of my sandwich had been consumed that the $5.95 stack of pancakes arrived and although impressive on their own with soft notes of buttermilk imbuing each bite it can only be said that the addition of bananas sautéed in butter represented a significant upgrade, the drizzle of caramel and mountain of whipped cream atop a generous scoop of ice cream and walnuts pushing the whole thing into dessert territory in the very best of ways.  Touting a menu far more interesting than several other local diners with prices that rival many chains for 'bargain' status Huntridge Pharmacy & Soda Fountain is a truly authentic experience in a city that many bemoan for being entirely too fake, the food far better than you'd expect given both the price and the locale.  Admittedly a bit lackluster in service given the skeleton staff, hand-written bills, and orders that occasionally back up when cooks are asked to prepare kosher options suffice it to say that the Soda Fountain is one of those spots everyone should visit at least once, and one that only stands to gain if and when the Huntridge Theater renovation finally takes place."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprise by this gem!  This is a \"dairy\" restaurant so no meat, that also means no bacon.  I ordered eggs with hash browns and toast.  Even the butter they give you with the toast was delicious!  They gave me a mountain of hash browns!!  I couldn't finish it!!  Also, I put up a picture of the OJ served being only half way full, I must say that Joseph, the red bearded guy walked by and filled our glasses with OJ, so I stand corrected.  My plate was only $3.95!!!  Also, they didn't have banana's for the Elvis pancakes but that did not stop them!! They promptly sent someone to the grocery store to get some so we could have our meal!!  I must say I give them props for going out of their way to please their customers!!!  I wanted to try a milkshake but I was so full I couldn't have one.    I would come back if I am in the area.  One of the best holes in the wall places!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from Phoenix and my sister only eats at Kosher restaurants. She said this was a new place and people were speaking well of it. I do not keep kosher any more, but to me a restaurant should have good food kosher or not. First when we walk in I think this place could be a really special little place. But to be honest I really don't see it lasting very long as is. The location does not serve it well. And from the outside you would never know that there is a fun looking retro diner vibe going on. If they are going to rely on word of mouth among the Jewish Community and think that will bring in enough people to sustain the business then they need to do some serious re-evaluating. This place is Kosher, but if the owners want this place to last the menu and food should be a place anyone regardless of being Jewish or not would want to eat there. But to be honest, the food would need to be elevated quite a bit along with the menu. I had the tuna sandwich. Basically it was tuna swimming in mayo. The bread was kind of stale, and with all that mayo it was hard to taste any tuna. My grandson asked for something and they didn't have it, so he made his second choice and they didn't have that either. As I said the place has a cool vibe with record vinyl  up on the walls with the record jackets. But no music playing in the background. It's Sunday, around 10 and the place is dead, we are the only 5 people in the place. The place should be packed. But with mediocre food at best and a basic boring menu along with no signage to attract you I think it's days are numbered."}
{"text":"This little place is a throwback to when Las Vegas was a simple town. My secretary/friend was recently promoted so we decided to take her here for a goodbye lunch since she is a devout vegan. When we walked in I wasn't sure if we were at the right place as it smelled kinda smoky and dingy but then I saw this cute little diner mimicking the 1950's. We were the only three people dining in the restaurant and \"William\" took such good care of us. I wasn't super hungry as I had eaten a late breakfast but my friend had the Caesars chik wrap with fries and then I split a pizza with my other friend. We all really enjoyed our lunch. I think the main reason was the great customer service provided by William and how welcome we felt at this establishment. I had read some other reviews by fellow yelpers and most gave a four/five star rating so I  thought why not, we could give this place a try which I am glad we did.  If you are in the neighborhood, stop by and check this place out and I hope William is working as he is a da bomb!"}
{"text":"The Huntridge Drug Store is a typical old Fashioned drug store with standard items including (of course) a pharmacy. They have a rack that has some outdated (vintage) postcards on it. I give it four stars not because it is an independent drugstore, not because it is attached to a dive bar, not because it had an old fashined lunch counter diner (it is open yet?) . Mostly I give it four stars because they staff I encounter there is always VERY friendly!"}
